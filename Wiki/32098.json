 "text": "A crew is a group of people that work as a team within a common organization and perform similar activities. Crews can be found in places like ships and airplanes. It is common for members of a crew to have a special role. Different positions within a crew are commonly organized on a scale of power, like a hierarchy, so that there is a clear chain of command. Aboard a ship, for example, every member of the crew has someone else above them, and this chain of power ends at the captain who is in charge of everyone below them. Teams who work backstage in theaters, on movie sets, and in television studios are also called crews. Such crews are distinct from the cast. Category:Occupations",
