 "text": "The April 2019 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 28 April 2019, to elect the 13th Cortes Generales of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 266 seats in the Senate. With a turnout of 71.8%, the controlling party PSOE of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez won a victory—the first for the party in a nationwide election in eleven years—with 28.7% of the vote and 123 seats. In the Senate, the PSOE became the largest party in the chamber for the first time since 1995, winning its first majority of seats in that chamber since the 1989 election. However, no party won an outright majority and the top three winners of this race had the option for a coalition government. To prevent this, Prime Minister Sánchez ordered a new election to be held seven months later. ==Notelist== ==References== Category:April 2019 events Category:2010s elections in Spain Category:2019 elections in Europe 2019",
