 "text": "Charge conjugation describes a type of symmetry of nature. To perform a charge conjugation, one would exchange all particles with their corresponding antiparticles. This action would create a physical system where everything would be the same except the electromagnetic charge would be reversed. For example, one could make an antihydrogen atom with an antiproton and an antielectron (called a positron). This would result in an atom with a negatively charged nucleus orbited by a positively charged positron. The total mass of this antihydrogen atom would be the same as a regular hydrogen atom. If the behavior of the system remains unchanged after charge conjugation, the system is said to be symmetric with respect to charge conjugation. This symmetry is also known as \"C-symmetry.\" Some interactions in the weak force have been shown to violate charge conjugation. This means the weak force is unlike the other fundamental forces. It treats particles and antiparticles differently. ==References== Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Symmetry",
