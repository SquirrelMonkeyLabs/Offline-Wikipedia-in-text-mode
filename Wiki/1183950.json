 "text": "Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL, also known simply as EUV) is a kind of photolithography. It is used in the semiconductor industry for making integrated circuits (ICs). This kind of lithography uses 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light from a laser-pulsed tin plasma to make (detailed or) intricate patterns on semiconductor substrates. , ASML Holding (a Dutch company) is the only company that produces and sells EUV systems for chip production, targeting 5 nanometer (nm) and 3 nm process nodes.
