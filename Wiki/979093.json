 "text": "\"La Balanguera\" (Balearic pronunciation: ; \"The Balanguera\") is the anthem of the Balearic Islands. ==Lyrics== Catalan original Majorcan Catalan IPA Spanish translation English translation I O mysterious Balanguera, like a spider of fine art, her spinning wheel emptieth and off our lives it pulleth. 𝄆 Like a Parca she pondereth, and seweth well tomorrow's cloth. The Balanguera spinneth, spinneth and the Balanguera shall spin. 𝄇 II Her glimpse to the past she turneth, O'er shades of ancestry she watcheth, and of the new spring she owneth; Of the seed's cover she knoweth. 𝄆 She knoweth that the stump higher climbeth, the deeper its roots can go. The Balanguera spinneth, spinneth and the Balanguera shall spin. 𝄇 III From traditions and from hopes The flag for the youth she weaveth as one who a wedding veil prepareth with hairs of gold and silver 𝄆 of the cradle that groweth of the old age that departeth. The Balanguera spinneth, spinneth and the Balanguera shall spin. 𝄇 ==References== Category:Balearic Islands Category:Spanish anthems",
