(Link verified February 24, 2016) The website claimed to be run by Dalitstan, a \"Human Rights Organization working for the Upliftment of Dalits, the Untouchables of India\". -stan is a suffix for \"place of\" (Link verified February 24, 2016) or \"country\", (Link verified February 24, 2016) and forms part of the name of many places throughout Central and South Asia. Dalitstan would mean \"place or country of the Dalits\". ==Claims and counter-claims== The website stated that the Dalits were the original people of India who created the Harappan civilization, and described the Brahmins as the descendants of the Aryan invaders who enslaved them. Dibyesh Anand of the University of Westminster described Dalitstan.org as a Dalit nationalist group that also acted as a forum for anti-India Christian and Muslim advocacy. ==Blocked by the Indian government== Dalitistan.org was one of 18 websites that were blocked in India by the Ministry of Telecommunications of the Government in July 2006. The purpose of the block was to try to stop terror and hate messages on the Internet following the 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings. ==History of domain== The website was started in 1999. The domain was registered by Helen Heklund, with an address in Granbury, Texas. The website was taken down sometime after May 2006. The domain registration lapsed (expired). The rights to the name were then purchased by someone else. ==References== Category:Nationalist organizations in India Category:Separatist movements of India Category:Indian websites",
