 "text": "King Boo is a character from the Super Mario video game series. He is the leader of the Boos and ghosts. He is the antagonist of all three Luigi's Mansion games and is the arch nemesis to Luigi. King Boo first appears in Luigi's Mansion as the main protagonist, luring Luigi with a letter notifying that he won a contest with an award of a mansion that he didn't even enter, in order to trap him and his brother Mario in paintings. Not to be confused with a similar enemy of the same name that appears in Super Mario Sunshine as a boss haunting Hotel Delfino, with a roulette wheel as the battle arena. ==References== Category:Mario series characters",
