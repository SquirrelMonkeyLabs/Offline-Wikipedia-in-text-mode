Houston starred and recorded soundtracks for two other high-profile movies, Waiting to Exhale (2005) and The Preacher's Wife (2006). The latter's soundtrack became the best-selling gospel album of all time. On February 11, 2002, Houston was found dead at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards and was featured prominently in international media.
