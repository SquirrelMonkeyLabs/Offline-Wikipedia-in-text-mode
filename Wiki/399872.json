 "text": "The Enhanced Fujita scale is a tornado category scale used to measure tornadoes in the United States and Canada, and some other countries by how bad their damage is. It is a replacement of the old Fujita scale that was made in 1971. The National Weather Service started using it on February 1, 2007 and Canada started in April 2013. More countries have used it since then. The weakest tornadoes on this scale are rated EF0, and the strongest ones are rated EF5. Tornadoes with the EF5 label represent winds faster than 200 miles an hour. No tornadoes in the United States that happened before February 1, 2007 will have their ratings changed to the new scale. Scale Wind speed (Estimated) Example of damage mph km/h EFU Unknown Unknown No damage Short for \"EF-Unknown.\" The tornado doesn't hit anything, so there is no damage to tell how strong it is, or nobody can get to the damage to rate it. N/A EF0 65-85 104-137 Small damage. Some damage to chimneys; branches broken off trees; sign boards damaged; some singles blown off. EF1 86-110 138-177 Medium damage. Badly peels surface off roofs; mobile homes pushed or rolled over; moving cars and trucks pushed off the roads; garages may be destroyed. EF2 111-135 178-217 Fairly bad damage. Roofs come off frame houses; mobile homes destroyed; big trees snapped or uprooted. EF3 136-165 218-266 Bad damage. Roofs and some walls come off well-made houses; trains rolled over; most trees in forest uprooted; skyscrapers twisted and messed up; heavy cars lifted off the ground and thrown. EF4 166-200 267-322 Very bad damage. Well-made houses leveled; buildings and other things with weak foundations blown away very far; skyscrapers and highrises destroyed. EF5 >200 >322 Worst damage. Strong frame houses lifted off foundations and thrown very far away which are soon destroyed; trees debarked; strong steel concrete structures badly damaged. ==References== Category:Severe weather Category:Tornadoes",
