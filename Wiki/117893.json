 "text": "Hibernian Football Club, also known as Hibs, is a professional football club based at Easter Road in Edinburgh, Scotland. They play in the Scottish Premiership. Their city rivals are Hearts. It is one of three SPFL clubs in the city, the others being their Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts and Edinburgh City. Hibernian was founded in 1875 by Irish immigrants, but support for the club is now based on geography rather than ethnicity or religion. The Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected, however, in its name, colours and badge. In 1887 Hibernian defeated Preston North End in a match nicknamed the Association Football Championship of the World decider, because of the two teams’ achievements in their domestic cup trophies. Hibs enjoyed enormous success throughout the 1940s and 50s where they won the 1947/8, 1950/1 and 1951/2 League Competitions. Their not-so-secret weapon was the attacking formation known as ‘The Famous Five’ consisting of Bobby Johnstone, Willie Ormond, Lawrie Reilly, Gordon Smith and Eddie Turnbull. Hibs became the first British team to enter European competition in 1955. They competed in the Champions Cup and gave a fantastic performance against the German club, Rot Weiss Essen, winning 4-1 and drawing 1-1 on the return match in Scotland. Hibernian F.C. was in grave danger of being closed down at the beginning of the 1990s when Wallace Mercer of rivals, Hearts of Midlothian, decided he wanted just one main club in Edinburgh. However, the club was saved in 1991 by Sir Tom Farmer CBE. Hibernian became the first team to be relegated via the SPFL playoffs in 2014.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/25/hibernian-hamilton- scottish-premiership-play-off In 2016 they ended their 114 year wait for the Scottish Cup, winning a final against Rangers 3-2.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36292302 In 2019, Tom Farmer sold the club to Ron Gordon.https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11755087/hibernian-taken- over-by-american-businessman-ron-gordon Gordon died in 2023.https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11792/12816593/ron-gordon- hibernian-executive-chairman-and-majority-shareholder-dies-aged-68 == Squad == :As of June 15 2008. ==References== Category:Scottish Premier League clubs Category:1875 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1870s establishments in Scotland Category:Organisations based in Edinburgh",
