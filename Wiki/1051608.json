 "text": "The AEW World Championship is a professional wrestling championship in All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It is the top men's championship and the most important championship in AEW. It is not a heavyweight championship because AEW doesn't have weight divisions. ==History== The title was introduced by Bret Hart in a segment at Double or Nothing on May 29, 2022. The first champion was Chris Jericho. Jericho defeated Adam Page in the main event of All Out. During CM Punk's first reign as champion, he got injured and wanted to drop the championship. AEW president Tony Khan said that Punk would keep the championship but a new interim champion would be crowned after a tournament. The interim champion would then face Punk after he returned from injury to see who would become the undisputed champion. Jon Moxley defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi at Forbidden Door. Punk returned and lost to Moxley. During his second reign, Punk had his title stripped from him and was suspended. This was because he had gotten into a real-life backstage fight with AEW's executive vice presidents. After a tournament, Moxley defeated Bryan Danielson at AEW Grand Slam to win the championship for a third time. Jon Moxley is the current champion in his record fourth reign. He defeated Bryan Danielson at WrestleDream. == Title history == == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:All Elite Wrestling championships",
