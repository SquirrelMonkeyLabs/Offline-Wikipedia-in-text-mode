 "text": "The National Assistance Act 1948 is an Act of Parliament passed in the United Kingdom by the Labour government of Clement Attlee. It abolished the Poor Law system that had been since the reign of Elizabeth I. It set up the the National Assistance scheme for people who were not covered by National Insurance. There was more money for poor people. Most people had all their rent paid. The National Assistance Board made rules about resources and requirements but they were not public. Claimants still did not have rights. The means test did not include the pay of sons and daughters. People over pension age were paid more. Northern Ireland had a seperate National Assistance Board. From 1966 there was Supplementary Benefit. ==References== Category:Social security in the United Kingdom Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Category:1948",
