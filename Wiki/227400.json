The song is a mid-tempo ballad sung from the perspective of the film's lead character, Alice. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song after asking Disney executives and director Tim Burton for a role on the soundtrack. The song was produced by Butch Walker and mixed by Lavigne's former husband Deryck Whibley. == Concept == While designing clothes inspired by Alice in Wonderland for her Abbey Dawn line, Lavigne told Disney executives she could write a song for the film's soundtrack. Director Tim Burton agreed, and Lavigne \"wrote the song immediately\" on her piano. Lavigne described the song as \"a little darker\" and confirmed the lyrics, \"trippin' out, spinnin' around, I'm underground, I fell down.\" ==Charts== Chart (2010) Peak position Canadian Hot 100 60 == References == Category:2010 songs Category:Avril Lavigne songs",
