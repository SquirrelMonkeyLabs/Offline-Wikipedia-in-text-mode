 "text": "The Calder and Hebble Navigation is a broad waterway, with locks and bridges that are suitable for 14-foot-wide (4.3 m) boats, in West Yorkshire. Improvements on the River Calder and the River Hebble began in 1759, The Rochdale Canal joined it in 1804. This let boats go from Sowerby Bridge to Manchester. It connects to the Aire and Calder Navigation at Wakefield. It joins the Huddersfield Broad Canal near Mirfield. There were many alterations over the years, so now it is mostly seperate from the river. The locks were designed for Yorkshire Keels. They are among the shortest on the English connected waterways network, at 57 feet (17 m). Since 1981 it has only been used by pleasure boats. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in West Yorkshire Category:Canals in England",
