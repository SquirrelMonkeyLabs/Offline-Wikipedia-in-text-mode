She is a former member of the R&B; female group, Destiny's Child with whom she won two Grammy Awards, but when the group was successfully prompted in the world she was forced to leave. When interviewed by MTV News, Luckett said that she and LaTavia Roberson created a new group called Anjel. Auditions were made, then Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin were selected as members. The group recorded demo songs. Their production company which handled the group fell through, and the members of Anjel went on to pursue solo projects. In 2004, Capitol Records signed Luckett, then she started her solo career. Her solo debut album, LeToya, topped the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in July 2006 and was certified platinum by the RIAA in December 2006. The album spawned five singles. Two were released with promotional purpose, to see the audience reaction towards her, but \"Torn\" would be her most notable song. It achieved records on BET's top ten countdown show 106 & Park. She was also named \"One of the Best New Artists of 2006\" by AOL and the \"Top Songwriter of 2006\" by ASCAP. Luckett's second album, Lady Love, was scheduled for a spring 2008 release. It was released in 2009. She is now on road with the stage play tour \"Rumors\". ==Discography== ===Albums CD=== *1998: Destiny's Child as Destiny's Child *1999: The Writing's on the Wall as Destiny's Child *2002: This Is the Remix as Destiny's Child *2005: #1's as Destiny's Child *2005: What It Do! *2006: LeToya *2008: Lady Love *2015: Lucky Girk Soundtrack (with Various artists) *2016: Until Then *2017: Back 2 Life ====Singles==== *2004: \"You Got What I Need\" *2005: \"All Eyes on Me\" *2006: \"Torn\" *2006: \"She Don't\" *2006: \"Obvious\" *2007: \"Almost Made Ya\" (with Ali & Gipp) *2007: \"Swagger\" (featuring UGK, Killa Kyleon and Slim Thug) *2008: \"I Miss You\" (with Webbie) *2011: \"When I Had the Chance\" (with Boney James) *2014: \"Don't Make Me Wait\" ===Tour=== *1998:\"Boyz 2 Men Tour\" as opening act (with Destiny's Child) *1999:\"TLC: FanMail Tour\" as opening act (with Destiny's Child) *1999:\"The Writing's on the Wall promotional tour\" (with Destiny's Child) *2006:\"The Breakthrough Tour\" as opening act ==References== ==Other websites== *LeToya's Myspace *Official fansite Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:African-American singers Category:African-American actors Category:Singers from Houston Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American pop musicians Category:American R&B; singers Category:Destiny's Child members Category:Actors from Houston",
