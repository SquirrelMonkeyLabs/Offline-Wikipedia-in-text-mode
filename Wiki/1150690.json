Battles occurred and the Majapahit defeated and ended the Nan Sarunai Kingdom while his commander, Empu Jatmika, established his own kingdom there and ruled as a tributary of the Majapahit. ==Battle== In 1355, Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit launched a third invasion of the Dayak Ma'anyan kingdom of Nan Sarunai, led by Raden Anyan (Datu Tatuyan Wulau Miharaja Papangkat Amas). The invasion was commanded by Empu Jatmika from Kalingga and Kediri, with his team including advisor Aria Megatsari, general Tumenggung Tatah Jiwa, and minister Wiramartas. The first battle, fought in April 1358 at Tambak Wasi, resulted in the death of Nan Sarunai's captain, Jamuhala, and the Majapahit forces suffering heavy casualties. Princes Jarang and Idong fled to Man near the Tabalong-Kiwa River, and Nan Sarunai soldiers regrouped in Pulau Kadap for the second battle, which occurred in December 1362. The second battle ended with the death of Raden Anyan at the hands of Mpu Nala, and he was buried in Banua Lawas. Following their defeat, Empu Jatmika established the Hindu kingdom of Negara Dipa, which became a tributary of Majapahit and eventually evolved into the Banjar kingdom. Survivors, including soldiers and artisans from various regions such as Java, Dayak, Madura, and Bugis, settled in areas like Amuntai, Alabio, and Nagara. These historical events are preserved in the Dayak Ma'anyan poetry known as Nansarunai Usak Jawa. == References == Category:Indonesia",
