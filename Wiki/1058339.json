 "text": "The WAGR Ea class were a total of 3 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1934 to 1939. The Ea class were the result of rebuilding several E class engines with less weight to run on lighter-laid lines, this was a success. Es class locos were also converted, becoming the Eas class. Despite being successful all had been reverted to their original form by the 1940s. None of the Ea class survives today, however, one Es class is displayed at the Bassendean Railway Museum.
