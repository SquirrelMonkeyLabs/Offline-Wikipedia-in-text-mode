The median age is 51.8 years, as of 2020. Ashland is part of the Natchitoches Micropolitan Statistical Area but is located nearly forty miles to the north of the parish seat of Natchitoches. == History == On September 2, 2011, a forest fire destroyed ten houses between Ashland and Creston, but residents escaped personal injury. According to Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Mike Strain, the blaze scorched several thousand acres and was propelled by past drought conditions combined with high winds coming from the aftermath of Tropical Storm Lee in the Gulf of Mexico. == Images == Image:Ashland, LA, entrance sign IMG 1624.JPG|Village limits Image:LA Hwy. 153 in Ashland, LA IMG 0064.JPG|Louisiana State Highway 153 in the village Image:Ashland Baptist Church, Ashland, LA IMG 1625.JPG|Ashland Baptist Church Image:Renovated Ashland (LA) Baptist Church IMG 0737.JPG|Renovated Ashland Baptist Church == References == == Other websites == Category:1963 establishments in the United States Category:Villages in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana Category:20th-century establishments in Louisiana",
