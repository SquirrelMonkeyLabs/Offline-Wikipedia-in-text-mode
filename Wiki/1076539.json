 "text": "Craig Martin Sorger (February 10, 1990 - February 15, 2003) was a 13-year-old American teenager who was tortured and murdered by his then-12-year-old tweenage friends Evan Drake Savoie (born October 22, 1990) and Jake Lee Eakin (born November 14, 1990) in Ephrata, Washington. == Murder == On the afternoon of February 15, 2003, Evan and Jake knocked on Craig's trailer's door and asked his mother if he could play with them. Craig convinced his mother to let him play with his friends and she decided to let him go. After that, they went to a nearby park and played for a while. After a few minutes, Evan asked Craig to touch the grass to see if it was wet and count to 10 and he did. While he was doing that, Evan grabbed a rock and threw it at Craig's neck. He then began to stab him with a knife at his head, neck, chest and torso. Jake joined in the attack, by beating Craig with a tree branch at his head and legs. They then left. Craig's best friend, who later testified as a witness, ran to him and tried to help him, Craig saw him and tried to tell him something, but died before doing so. == Conviction and aftermath == They were arrested three days later and in 2005 Jake was sentenced to 14 years in prison and in 2006 Evan was sentenced to 26 years in prison. In 2014 that was reduced to 20 years in prison. They were the youngest murder defendants to be charged as adults in Washington state history. Jake was released in February 2017 and claims to have been born again and is now an anti-abortion activist with a wife, Marissa and two daughters. They live in Greenville County, South Carolina. However, he was arrested two times after his release: One in 2018 for trespassing and another one in 2022 for larceny. Evan was released in February 2023 and has now a wife, Linnea and a daughter. They live in Multnomah County, Oregon. == Notes == Category:1990 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Murdered children Category:People from Washington (state) == References == Category:2000s murders in the United States",
