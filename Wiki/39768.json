It was finally hit, but with two spears, one from each of the hunters. They could not decide who threw the spear that caused the boar to die. The boar finally broke down exactly at the border between Seßlach and Ebern, with its head in Ebern, and its body in Seßlach, so they divided it. That is why the town Ebern is named after the boar, and the town's flag carries the head of the boar.
