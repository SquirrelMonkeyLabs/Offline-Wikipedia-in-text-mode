Flowers are most often blue in color, although pink flowers are sometimes examined. White flowered types are also grown. == Cooking == As a fresh vegetable, borage, with a cucumber like taste, is often used in salads or as a garnish. The flower, which has the non- toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid thesinine, has a sweet honey-like taste and as one of the few truly blue-colored eatable things, is often used to decorate dessert.Borage Wildflower Finder == References == Category:Boraginaceae",
