 "text": "Cultural Marxism is a far-right conspiracy theory that claims that Western Marxism, especially ideas from the Frankfurt School, is behind modern progressive movements, identity politics, and political correctness. The theory suggests that there is a secret plan to change Western society by attacking traditional Christian values and replacing them with liberal cultural values. The term \"Cultural Marxism\" is based on a Nazi propaganda idea called \"Cultural Bolshevism.\" This conspiracy theory first appeared in the United States in the 1990s. It was originally a fringe idea but began spreading to the mainstream in the 2010s and is now discussed around the world. The theory is often pushed by right-wing politicians, religious leaders, media figures, and even white supremacists. == References == Category:Antisemitism",
