 "text": "The WAGR S class were a total of 10 large steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1943 to 1972. The S class were notable for being the only full design by Midland Railway Workshops, having been originally proposed in the 1930s by Draftsman Frederick Mills, who went on to become the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the WAGR until his death in 1949. An initial 3 were constructed in 1943, with another 2 following in 1945, and the last 5 in 1947. The S class were named after mountains in Western Australia and were originally intended for mixed traffic work, upon their entry into service they worked on the Eastern Railway and Eastern Goldfields Railway on passenger and freight services. However, they were soon moved onto heavy goods traffic on the Great Southern Railway and South Western mainline, where they performed admirably. Withdrawals were carried out in 1971-72, with three left in preservation. No. 542 (477) Bakewell is currently displayed at East Perth terminal, No. 547 Lindsay is stored awaiting restoration in Queenscliff, Victoria, and No. 549 Greenmount is operational at the Bassendean Railway Museum where it is also displayed. == Gallery == Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives File:S476, photographic grey, ca. 1943.jpg|No. 476 (later 541) Bruce outside Midland workshops in 1943 with photographic grey livery.
