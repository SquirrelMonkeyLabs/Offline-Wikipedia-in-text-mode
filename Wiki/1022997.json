 "text": "A grease duct is a duct that vents flammable vapors from commercial cooking equipment such as stoves and deep fryers to the outside of the building. It will normally be connected to an exhaust fan. == Fire hazard == Vapors are created when grease is heated to and beyond its vaporization point. When it cools, the grease will condense on colder surfaces. Grease is a flammable hydrocarbon. == Design == In many places, they will be constructed out of stainless-steel ductwork connected through a series of air filters which will be pulled by a fan and exhausted outside. They will also often have some form of fire damper in this ductwork connected to the fire alarm system. == Maintenance and cleaning == These systems must be cleaned sometimes. Many will have certificates issued by the cleaning and maintenance contractors. Sunday, 2 May 2021 Problems with hoods that are not taken care of include poor ventilation, excess heat and smoke, and the potential risk of fires. == References == == Other websites == * UL treatise on wrapping systems * NFPA 96: Standard for Ventilation Control and Fire Protection of Commercial Cooking Operations * ASTM E2336 Standard Test Methods for Fire Resistive Grease Duct Enclosure Systems * ISO 6944-1:2008 Fire containment -- Elements of building construction -- Part 1: Ventilation ducts Category:HVAC Category:Commercial kitchen equipment",
