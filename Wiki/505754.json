The shallot was previously classified as a separate species, A. ascalonicum. == Growth == Shallots seldom produce seeds. They are increased by dividing its compound bulbs. These are made up of several bulblets or cloves held together at the base. The bulblets are planted the same as onion sets. Each set develops into a compound set. The mature bulbs are harvested, cured and stored the same way as onions. In suitable storage, the bulbs keep from one season to the next. == Flavour == The flavor of shallots is a little milder than onions. Itâ€™s used for flavoring curries. Both leaves and cloves are used. Leaves are also consumed as green vegetables. Like their cousins onions and garlics, this is also considered as non-vegetarian food in India. Most of the crop is produced for sale in the green state. But some dry bulbs are also used. They are also used for pickling. == References == category:Allium Category:Root vegetables",
