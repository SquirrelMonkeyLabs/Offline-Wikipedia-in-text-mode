 "text": "Maria Esther Andion Bueno (11 October 1939 – 8 June 2018) was a Brazilian professional tennis player. She played for eleven years in the 1950s and 1960s. She won 19 Grand Slam titles (seven in women's singles, 11 in women's doubles, and one in mixed doubles). That made her the most successful South American female tennis player in history. Bueno was the year-end number-one ranked female player in 1959 and 1960. She was known for her graceful style of play. In 1960, Bueno became the first woman to win a calendar-year Grand Slam (all four major tennis tournaments in a year). Three of them were with Darlene Hard. The other was with Christine Truman). On 8 June 2018, Bueno died from oral cancer and merkel-cell carcinoma at a hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, aged 78. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1939 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Female tennis players Category:Sportspeople from São Paulo",
