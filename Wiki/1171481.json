 "text": "Dream was an American girl group formed in 1998, primarily consisting of Holly Blake-Arnstein, Diana Ortiz, Ashley Poole, and Melissa Schuman. The group was signed to rapper Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Records label and released their debut studio album It Was All a Dream in 2001, which peaked at number six on the Billboard 200. The album was preceded by the single \"He Loves U Not\" which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and was followed by the moderate chart hit \"This is Me\". Amid conflicts with their label, their second studio album Reality (2003) did not see a widespread release following the release of its first single, \"Crazy\", and the group disbanded. Dream briefly reunited in 2015 and independently released the single \"I Believe\" the following year before disbanding once more. Category:American musical groups Category:American girl groups",
