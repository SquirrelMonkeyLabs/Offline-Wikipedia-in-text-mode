 "text": "Inferno by the Italian author Dante, is a work of fiction made in the 1500s, as a part of The Divine Comedy. It tells of the fictional journey that two men, Dante himself as well as Greek poet Virgil, takes place through Christian Hell. Hell is made up of several levels, or circles, in which sinners are divided and punished according to their sins. Their punishments are measured according to how many good deeds vs bad deeds were done. The Divine Comedy describes the journey of the soul toward God. And Inferno is about the recognition and rejection of sin. Dorothy L. Sayers, Hell, notes, p. 19. == References == Category:14th-century books Category:Afterlife",
