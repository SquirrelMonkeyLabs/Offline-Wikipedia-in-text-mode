 "text": "\"Dead Putting Society\" is the sixth episode of The Simpsons second season. It first started on the Fox network in the United States on November 15, 1990, and was the first episode to have the \"Flanders family\" prominently. In this episode, Bart, and Ned Flanders' son, Todd, decide to enter a miniature golf tournament. Homer becomes sure that Bart will win and makes a bet with Ned that the father of the losing boy will have to mow their neighbor's lawn in their wife's Sunday dress. On the day of the tournament, Bart and Todd make the finals but made it a draw, which meant both Homer and Ned had to fulfill the bet. == Other websites == * * * Category:1990 television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 2) episodes",
