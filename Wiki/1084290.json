 "text": "Pleuropholis is an extinct genus of prehistoric ray-finned fish belonging to the Pleuropholidae. Fossils have been found in Europe and North America. It lived between the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Kimmeridgian-Albian, about 155-110 million years ago). The type species is Pleuropholis crassicauda. == Description == Pleuropholis was a small, sardine-like fish, usually no more than 10cm or four inches long in total length. It had a slender body elongated head and a rounded snout. The mouth was moderately deep and the eyes were large. The dorsal fin was far away. It had scales with serrated edges. == Species == Species of the genus Pleuropholis: * †Pleuropholis cisnerosorum Alvarado-Ortega & Brito, 2016 * †Pleuropholis crassicauda Egerton, 1858 (type) * †Pleuropholis danielae Brito & Vullo, 2023 * †Pleuropholis formosa Woodward, 1919 * †Pleuropholis longicaudata Egerton, 1858 * †Pleuropholis serrata Egerton, 1858 * †Pleuropholis thiollieri Sauvage, 1883 == Fossils == == Paleobiology == Pleuropholis is a fish that inhabited shallow lagoons and brackish and marine waters.
