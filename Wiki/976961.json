 "text": "Geek rock (also known as nerd rock or science rock) is a musical subgenre. It was derived from pop rock and new wave within the nerd music group. Geek rock first started to diverge from new wave with the nervy, often science fiction- themed work of late 1970s XTC, Robyn Hitchcock and Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias in the UK, and quirky bands Devo and Oingo Boingo in the USA. ==Related pages== *List of geek rock artists Category:Rock music",
