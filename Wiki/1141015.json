 "text": "A trash compactor is a useful machine designed to reduce the volume of waste by compressing it. The process begins with loading the trash into the compactor. Once the trash is inside, the machine is turned on, and a metal ram pushes down on the trash, crushing it to make it more compact. This compression significantly reduces the space the trash occupies, allowing more waste to fit into the same bin. Trash compactors are commonly used in both homes and businesses to manage waste more efficiently, ultimately reducing the number of trips needed to take out the trash. ==References== Category:Machines",
