 "text": "Indoor cricket is a form of cricket that is played in an indoors area much smaller than a regular cricket field. There are multiple versions of indoor cricket, and games can be played with different time lengths. ==Playing area== The indoor cricket court is a area, with the pitch being long and meters wide except in the area where the bowler delivers the ball. There is a running crease 11 meters away from the batting crease. The batting crease is from the other popping crease. ==Rules== The batsmen run between the batting crease and the running crease to score runs. The bowler delivers the ball with part of their front foot behind the bowling crease (which is the popping crease at the bowler's end of the pitch; it is not to be confused with the \"wicket line\", the indoor cricket term for what regular cricket calls the bowling crease). The bowler is allowed to deliver the ball underarm, but if they do so, the ball must bounce beyond the underarm line. Teams may have less than 11 players. ==References== Category:Minor forms of cricket",
