 "text": "Buangkok MRT Station (NE15) is an underground MRT station in Sengkang, Singapore. It opened on 15 January 2006. It opened after the public wanted it to be opened. It is part of the North East MRT Line. ==History== When the North East Line opened, it was one of the 2 completed MRT stations of North East Line that was not open, the other being Woodleigh which opened on 20 June 2011. This station was originally planned to be opened with 15 other stations on the North East Line. However, a few days before the opening, the operator SBS Transit decided not to open the station as the area around the station was undeveloped and the company claimed that the number of passengers would be too low to cover operating costs. The station was maintained like any other station throughout the time before it was opened. To prepare for the station's opening, the programming had to be updated to include Buangkok. Residents had said they would be willing to walk 400 metres to the station every day. SBS Transit expected around 3,500 passengers to use the station daily, which would be the lowest among all the stations along the line, resulting in the station making a loss. However, the actual numbers were much lower than expected during its first week of operation. Only an average of 1,386 passengers used the station each day. For comparison, Clarke Quay station, which is the second most unused station, already had more than 6,000 passenger trips daily. However, Clarke Quay was located in the Central Business District with considerable development in the area. From 5 January 2018, cash top ups are not accepted at the passenger service centres at this station. == Art in Transit == There is an artwork in the station. It was made by Vincent Leow. It is called Water, Nature and the Contemporary (current). ==Related pages== *Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) == References == Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:Sengkang",
