 "text": "Roti is a type of Indian flatbread made using different flours. It is a staple food in many parts of India and other South Asian countries. Roti can be made from wheat flour, rice flour, millet flour, corn flour, or a combination of these. The dough is kneaded with water and sometimes salt, oil, or ghee. Then it is rolled into thin circles and cooked on a hot griddle or tawa. Roti can be eaten plain or with various accompaniments such as curries, dal, pickles, chutneys, or yogurt. Roti is also known by different names in different regions, such as chapati, phulka, paratha, naan, kulcha, or bhakri. ==Variants== File:Roti-obaid.jpg|Roti in the Indian subcontinent File:Roti Prata Curry Large.JPG|Singaporean roti prata served with curry File:Plainrotiparatha.jpg|Plain roti paratha File:Roti Wrap Trafasie.jpg|A roti wrap with boiled egg and smoked chicken in the Netherlands File:Thalichapati.jpg|Indian thali with chapati File:Lunch special at Pakwan.jpg|Tandoori roti served with other dishes in an Indian restaurant File:Rumali roti.jpg|A chef preparing rumali roti in India File:Bajhar_ji_maani.jpg|Bajhar ji maani (bajra roti) in Tharparkar, Sindh File:A thali with daal roti bhindi ki sabzi and mango pickle.jpg|Spicy vegetables served with rotis File:Roti pisang.jpg|Roti stuffed with bananas == References == Category:Breads Category:Indian food Category:Nepalese food Category:Fijian food Category:Jamaican food Category:Mauritian food Category:Pakistani food Category:Trinidad and Tobago food Category:Guyanese food Category:Surinamese food Category:Bangladeshi food Category:Sri Lankan food Category:Indonesian food Category:Malaysian food Category:Persian food",
