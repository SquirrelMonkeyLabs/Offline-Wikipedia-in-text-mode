 "text": "The CNN Center was a center in Atlanta, Georgia, near the College Football Hall of Fame, World of Coke, and the Georgia Aquarium. It was host to the headquarters of CNN. You were able to take a tour around the center, experiencing how CNN filmed their news channel. Standard tours ran every 20 minutes from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily and cost $15 for adults; $14 for seniors, students and teens ages 13 to 18; and $12 for children ages 4 to 12. Kids 3 and younger also could get in for free. The CNN Center was a popular tourist attraction, one reason being that it held the tallest free-standing escalator in Atlanta, but it was announced on June 29, 2020, that the place was going to be sold. Today, the front of the building, hosting a large CNN sign, is a popular place for photography. Category:CNN",
