 "text": "Leg spin is a type of bowling style in cricket where the ball is spun with the wrist. It makes the ball move strangely, making it hard for the batsman. Leg spin is tricky and uses different types of spins to confuse the batsman. It's a difficult but interesting part of cricket. The leg spinner's normal delivery causes the ball to spin from right to left (from the bowlers perspective). The ball generally spins away from the leg side, and this is where it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. ==References== Category:Terminology of cricket",
