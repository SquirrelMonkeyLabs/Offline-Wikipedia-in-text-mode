It is two miles (3 km) northwest of RedruthOrdnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End and had a population of 5585 in the 2001 census. Originally a rural area supporting itself by farming and agriculture, Illogan shared in the general prosperity brought about by the 19th century mining boom, which was experienced by the whole Camborne-Redruth area.Thomas, J. (1990) Illogan: More than a Village, p. vii. Redruth: Dyllansow Truran. The church is dedicated to Saint Illogan, of whom little is known. Illogan was the birthplace of engineer and inventor Richard Trevithick.Payton, P.(2004) Cornwall: a History, p. 187. Fowey: Cornwall Editions ==Geography== There are two Illogan parishes: * St Illogan Church Parish stretching from Piece and Carnkie, to Portreath on the North Coast; Brea and Tuckingmill along the River Connor to the West; and Porthtowan, Sparnon Gate and Redruth Coombe to the East. The population is approximately 14,000; making it more populous than Redruth. It was the third largest in Cornwall. Before 1935, the church and civil parish boundaries were the same. * Illogan Civil Parish stretching from Bridge and Harris Mill in the East; Tolvaddon and Bell Lake in the West; and from the A30 to Reskajeage on the North Cliffs. In 1985, civil parish status was given back to Illogan, but as the population was too large, Illogan was divided into the civil parishes of Carn Brea, Illogan and Portreath. ==References== Category:Villages in Cornwall Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall",
