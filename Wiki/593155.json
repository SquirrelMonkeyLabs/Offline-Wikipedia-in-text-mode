 "text": "The Room is a 2003 American independent romantic drama movie. It stars Tommy Wiseau. He also wrote, directed, produced it. The movie is mainly about a love affair where a banker named Johnny (played by Wiseau), is cheated on by his future wife Lisa (Juliette Danielle), with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). The movie is considered by many to be the worst movie ever made, but is enjoyed by a cult audience for its odd story structure, having bad acting and being funny, although mostly not on purpose. A lot of the movie brings up unrelated subplots that do not get solved. Most of these have at least one supporting character. There is also confusion about why the movie is called \"The Room\", but Wiseau says he named it that because a room in a house is where lots of good and bad things take place. ==References== Category:2003 romantic drama movies Category:American black comedy movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:Cult movies Category:Infidelity in movies Category:Movies set in San Francisco Category:Suicide in movies Category:American independent movies",
