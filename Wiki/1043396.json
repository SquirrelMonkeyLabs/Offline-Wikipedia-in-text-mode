 "text": "Otte Brahe (2 October 1518 â€“ 9 May 1571) was a Danish nobleman and statesman. He was part of the privy council. He was married to Danish noblewoman Beate Clausdatter Bille. Otte Brahe was the father of two famous astronomers Tycho Brahe and Sophia Brahe. Brahe became very sick in Denmark in late 1570 and died on May 9, 1571. This made Bille a widow. When he died, he left behind a lot of property including 500 farms, 60 cottages, 14 mills, Knutstrup Castle, country manor houses, and houses in Copenhagen. It took until 1574 to fully settle his total properties. == References == Category:1518 births Category:1571 deaths Category:Danish politicians Category:Nobility",
