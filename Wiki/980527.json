It consists of men's clothing, women's clothing, and footwear: Adidas Yeezy Boost 750, Adidas Yeezy Boost 350, and Adidas 950 Boots. On October 25, 2022, Adidas said that they were going to stop making Yeezys because of antisemitic comments that West said. Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 comes in a lot of colourways.One of the rarest colorway is a Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 \"Turquoise Grinch\" ==Clothing== The collaboration's first season was noted for its stripped down, ready-to-wear style, which drew on military clothing and flesh-toned colors. Vogue observed a downbeat aesthetic and \"a protective toughness, a body-conscious severity that made the clothes more than a simple accessory.\" ==Yeezy Boost== On December 3, 2013, Adidas confirmed a new footwear collaboration agreement with West. West confirmed the release of the Adidas Yeezy Boosts with an announcement on Twitter directing fans to the yeezy.supply domain. The Yeezy Boosts release and the full Adidas collaboration was shown in New York City on February 12, 2015, streaming free to 50 theatres in 13 countries worldwide. An initial release of the Adidas Yeezy Boost 750 was limited to 9,000 pairs to be available only in New York City via the Adidas smartphone app; the Adidas Yeezy Boosts sold out in 10 minutes. Shoes released worldwide on February 28, 2015 were limited to select boutique stores with Adidas Consortium accounts and Adidas Originals stores. ==References== ==Other websites== * adidas YEEZY Season 1 * adidas YEEZY Season 2 * Yeezy Supply Category:2015 establishments Category:2022 disestablishments Category:Footwear Category:Kanye West",
