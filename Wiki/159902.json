It is a listed building in France (French: Momunment Historique) since 19 September 2006. The bridge dates back to the Middle Ages. It is made of stone and has five arches. It is one of the oldest of its kind in the Calvados department. Pilgrims used to use it to go to the Mont-Saint-Michel. Many inns, a cabaret, a bakery and a blacksmith settled around the bridge. In the 18th century, people used the bridge more because of Lime commerce. In 1850, the inhabitants built a more modern bridge. ==References== Category:Communes in Calvados",
