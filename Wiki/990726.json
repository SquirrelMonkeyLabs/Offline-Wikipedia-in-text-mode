 "text": "Quotient space is a term from linear algebra. It is a vector space that is made using a vector subspace, and a parallel projection. The elements of quotient spaces are equivalence classes. A simple example of a quotient space is the following: take the Cartesian coordinate system and draw a straight line which goes through the origin of that system. All the lines which are parallel to that line are a quotient space. == More detailed description == In linear algebra, the quotient space of a vector space V by a subspace N, also said V/N, is the set of vectors v and w of V such that v-w is in N. We can also say that v added by any vector of N is in the class of v, also called [v]. The set of v and vectors in V such that v plus all those vectors are in N are written V/N (V/N = {v + N | v ∈ V }). Also, two vectors of V are equivalent if their substraction are in W. The quotient space shares this two propierties: * α[x] = [αx] for all α ∈ K, and * [x] + [y] = [x + y]. Also, dim(V /W) = dim V − dim W. We will construct an explicit basis for V/W. Let (w1, . . . , wn) be a basis of W, and extend it to a basis (w1, . . . , wn, v1, . . . , vk) of V. Note that with this notation, dim W = n and dim V = n + k. We claim that (v1 \\+ W, . . . , vk \\+ W) forms a basis of V /W, in other words, ([v1], [v2], . . . , [vk]). If so, we will then have dim(V /W) = k = (n + k) − n = dim V − dim W as claimed.
