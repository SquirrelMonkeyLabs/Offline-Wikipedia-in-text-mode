 "text": "The Gospel Oak to Barking line (sometimes unofficially called the GOBLIN) is part of the Network Rail system. It is long from one terminus to the other. It carries both through goods trains and London Overground passenger trains, connecting Gospel Oak station in north London and Barking Riverside station in east London. The line is part of Network Rail Strategic Route 6, and is classified as a London and South East Commuter line. For much of its existence the line has played a minor role in London's transport system. It is now receiving significant investment to increase its capacity. This will include full 25 kV AC overhead electrification, that was completed in 2018. ==References== Category:London Overground Category:Rail transport in London Category:Transport in the London Borough of Camden Category:Transport in the London Borough of Islington Category:Transport in the London Borough of Haringey Category:Transport in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Transport in the London Borough of Newham Category:Transport in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham",
