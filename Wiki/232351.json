 "text": "In professional wrestling, a battle royal (sometimes spelled battle royale; plural battles royal or battle royals) is a match type in which many wrestlers fight against each other at the same time and wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left. That person is then the winner. Usually, a battle royal begins with a number of wrestlers in the ring, who are then eliminated by being pushed out of the ring, over the top rope, and having both feet touch the floor outside the ring. A popular example of the battle royal is the Royal Rumble match that is put on yearly in January by WWE. ==Team based== Team based battle royals consist of two or more teams of wrestlers, with the number of wrestlers on each team usually being equal. There are different types of such matches: *A team is eliminated when only one wrestler for that team is eliminated. *Matches ends when there are wrestlers for only one team (the winners), who have not been eliminated. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Professional wrestling",
