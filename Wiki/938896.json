 "text": "The North Aral Sea is the northern part of the Aral Sea. It is also called little Aral Sea. It split form the rest in 1987 and 1988. The southern part of the Aral Sea was called South Aral Sea. North Aral Sea is mainly fed by Syr Darya. There is a dam, called Dike Kokaral, which separates it from the rest of the Aral Sea. The dam had a poor design, but in 2005, the government of Kazakhstan could improve it. Since then the water levels of the lake have risen. ==References== Category:Aral Sea",
