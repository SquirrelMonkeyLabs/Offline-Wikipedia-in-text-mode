In 1955, postal service started again. For a short time, Pacheco had a lot of very successful businesses. During that time, ships from the Pacific Ocean were able to get to the town by going through Pacheco Slough. Then, during the 1860s, there were some fires, floods, and an earthquake. These destroyed the town and filled the slough with silt so that ships could not get there any more. Many people later left Pacheco to go to the nearby town of Todos Santos, which was later renamed to Concord. == Annexation == In January 2011, the Martinez City Council voted to take over the parts of Pacheco that are north of California State Route 4. The government was expected to approve the takeover in the fall of 2011. In March 2012, enough people objected that an election would have to be held about the issue.Mart, Greta. \"Residents Likely To Hit Polls Over N. Pacheco Annexation.\" Martinez News Gazette.
