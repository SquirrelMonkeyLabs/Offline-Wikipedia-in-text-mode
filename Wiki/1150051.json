 "text": "The Yurimaguas poison frog (Ameerega hahneli) is a frog. It lives in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. ==Body== The adult male frogs are 17.0 to 19.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult females 19 to 22 long. The skin of the frog's back is black in color. Most frogs have a gray or green pattern. The belly is black with a light blue pattern. The skin of the legs are brown with a black pattern. There is a white or near-white line over the eye to where the back legs meet the body. There is a line over the mouth to where the front legs meet the body. There are yellow-orange marks on the bottoms of the legs. ==Name== Scientists named this frog haneli after the person who caught it, Hahnel. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. People have seen this frog on dead palm branches on the ground. Scientists saw the frog between 150 and 1500 meters above sea level. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks. ==Young== The male frog sits somewhere high, for example a tree branch, and he calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the frogs carry the tadpoles to water, for example rivers, pools, and swamps. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans do change the places where the frog lives in some places to make farms, to get wood to build with, and to make places for people to live. People do sell this frog as a pet. This is legal. People are allowed to raise the frog away from the wild. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
