 "text": "Barabbas is a person from the Bible who lived around the time of Jesus (33 AD). He has a bad reputation for being a liar, thief, insurrectionist and zealot. He was released by Pontius Pilate the Roman governor of JudeaMatthew 27;2; Luke 3:1 who presided over Jesus' trial.Matthew 27:11; Mark 15:2; Luke 23:1; John 18:28-38 The most notable thing about Barabbas is that this name was his surname (last name), but his first name was also Jesus. So when Pilate — who was warned by his wife to leave this Holy man alone —Matthew 27:19 offered to set free one of the prisoners, he was offering the crowd in Jerusalem two Jesuses to choose from: Jesus Barabbas or Jesus of Nazareth. Pilate released Barabbas and ordered Jesus,Matthew 27:26 \"King of the Jews\",John 19:15,19-22 to be crucified.Matthew 27:24; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:24,25; John 19:16,18 ==References== Category:New Testament people Category:Ancient Israeli people",
