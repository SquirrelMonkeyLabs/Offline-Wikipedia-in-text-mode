 "text": "Steven Levy (born 1951) is an American journalist who has written several books on computers, technology, cryptography, the Internet, cybersecurity, and privacy. ==7 Commandments of the Personal Computer Revolution== In 1984 Levy established the 7 commandments of the Personal Computer revolution. It was the basis for the Personal Computer and Internet social ethos: #Access to Computers - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total. #Always yield to the Hands-on Imperative. #All information should be free. #Mistrust authority - promote decentralization. #Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position. #You can create art and beauty on a computer. #Computers can change your life for the better. ==Career== Levy is a senior writer for Wired. Previously, he was chief technology writer and a senior editor for Newsweek. Levy has had articles published in Harper's, Macworld, The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Premiere, and Rolling Stone. He is regarded (along with Walter Mossberg) as a prominent and respected critic of Apple Inc.. In July 2004, Levy wrote a cover story (which also featured an interview with Apple CEO Steve Jobs) which unveiled the 4th generation of the iPod to the world before Apple had officially done so, an unusual event since Apple is well known for its tight- lipped press policy. Levy has won several awards, including the \"Computer Press Association Award\" for a report he co-wrote in 1998 on the Year 2000 problem. In 1978, Steven Levy rediscovered Albert Einstein's brain in the office of the pathologist who removed and preserved it. In 1984, he wrote a book called Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, in which he described a “hacker ethic”, which became a guideline to understanding how computers have advanced into the machines that we know and use today. He identified this Hacker Ethic to consist of key points such as that all information is free, and that this information should be used to “change life for the better”. Levy received his bachelor's degree from Temple University and earned a Master's degree in literature from Pennsylvania State University. He lives in New York City with his wife, Pulitzer Prize winner Teresa Carpenter, and son. == Books by Levy == * In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives (2011) * The Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture, and Coolness (2006) * Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government Saving Privacy in the Digital Age (2001) * Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything (1994) * Artificial Life: The Quest for a New Creation (1992) * The Unicorn's Secret: Murder in the Age of Aquarius (1988) * Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984) == Other websites == * Steven Levy's website * iPod: I love you, you're perfect, now change - Salon.com article on Levy's 2006 book The Perfect Thing * * Authors@Google: Steven Levy * Lebowski Podcast Episode 27 - Steven Levy's Wish List Interview with Steven Levy about The Big Lebowski and his interview with the Coen Brothers. * Lebowski Podcast Episode 27a - Steven Levy on Technology Chalupa and Steven Levy talk about blogging, twitter, internet security, etc. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Jewish American writers Category:Journalists from Pennsylvania Category:Writers from Philadelphia Category:American bloggers",
