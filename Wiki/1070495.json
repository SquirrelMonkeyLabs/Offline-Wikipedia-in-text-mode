 "text": "Yan Hui (521â€“481 BC) was a Chinese philosopher and the favorite disciple of Confucius. He is highly respected in Confucianism, venerated in Confucian temples as one of the Four Sages. Yan Hui is also known as Ziyuan and Yan Yuan, using his courtesy name and a combination of his surname and courtesy name. He is often referred to reverently as Master Yan or Yanzi. == Life == Yan Hui, born in the state of Lu, was the son of Confucius' early disciple Yan Wuyou. Despite being about 30 years younger than Confucius, Yan Hui became a student of Confucius at a young age. Confucius favored Yan Hui, once saying, \"After I got Yan Hui, the disciples came closer to me.\" On a hill with Zilu and Zigong, Confucius asked them about their goals. Zilu showed bravery, Zigong demonstrated eloquence, and Yan Hui expressed a desire to find an intelligent king. Yan Hui wished to spread teachings on virtue, guide people with propriety and music, and promote peaceful living without the need for walls or weapons. Confucius praised Yan Hui's virtuous vision. == Veneration and temple == Yan Hui, like Confucius, was highly respected by the first emperor of the Han dynasty. He holds the title \"Fusheng\" (Continuator of the Sage), given in 1530. Yan Hui is honored as the first of the Four Assessors in the Temple of Confucius. In Qufu's walled city, Yan Hui is revered at the Temple of Yan Hui, located north of the Temple of Confucius. His tomb, situated in the Yan Family Cemetery (\"Yan Forest\"), is surrounded by many family tombs. A stele, originally from the Jurchen Jin dynasty, was reinstated during the Ming Dynasty, and Yan Hui's tomb remains well preserved. == References == Category:520s BC births Category:481 BC deaths Category:Confucianism",
