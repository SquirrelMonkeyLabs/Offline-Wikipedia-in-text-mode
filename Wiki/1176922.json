It features a man returning to his house where the news interview is playing on TV. He considers catching up on work, but what the old man says on TV apparently changes his mind and he decides to spend the time with his wife and son instead. Chesney performs the song outside the house, while home videos of life milestones for various people appear on the glass walls. The video was shot at the historical Farnsworth House, designed by Mies van der Rohe in the late 1940s. The house is located in Plano, Illinois, about 60 miles southwest of Chicago. The video debuted at number 20 on CMT's Top 20 Countdown for the week of August 30, 2007.
