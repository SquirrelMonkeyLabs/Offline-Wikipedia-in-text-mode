 "text": "An elliptical trainer, also known as a cross-trainer, is a stationary exercise machine used to simulate walking, running, or stair climbing. It offers a low- impact form of cardiovascular exercise that reduces strain on the joints, making it a popular option for people with joint issues or those recovering from injuries. By engaging both the upper and lower body, elliptical trainers provide a full-body workout. == History == Elliptical trainers were first introduced in the 1990s by the fitness equipment manufacturer Precor. Their first model, the Elliptical Fitness Crosstrainer (EFX), was released in 1995. It featured a rear flywheel design and allowed the user's foot to roll naturally from heel to toe, replicating the motion of walking or running. The patented four-bar linkage system that Precor developed enabled smooth, elliptical motion and significantly reduced the impact on joints compared to other cardio equipment like treadmills. == Types == Elliptical trainers are generally categorized based on the placement of the drive system: * Rear- drive: The most traditional design, with a flywheel located at the back of the machine, providing smooth movement. * Front-drive: The flywheel is positioned at the front, offering a more compact design, but the movement may feel slightly different compared to rear-drive models. * Center-drive: Features a flywheel placed near the center, providing a balanced and upright workout experience. == Benefits == The elliptical trainer is favored for its low- impact nature, as it provides a cardiovascular workout without the jarring effects on the joints, common in running or stair climbing. The adjustable resistance and ability to change speeds allow users to customize their workouts, varying from light to intense. Many elliptical models also include movable handlebars, offering users the ability to work their upper body in conjunction with their lower body, providing a full-body workout. == Common usage == Elliptical trainers are used widely in gyms, fitness centers, and homes as part of a cardiovascular exercise routine. They are particularly effective for individuals looking for a low-impact workout to build endurance and strengthen muscles without over-straining joints.https://doi.org/10.1097%2F00005768-200205001-00198 == Related pages == * Treadmill == References == Category:Sports equipment",
