During this period, together with other young lawyers and law students, he founded the Institute of Legal Studies of El Salvador (IEJES), of which he has been president on several occasions. From the IEJES he promoted the defense of the rule of law, democratic freedoms and social justice, which generated an alternative option to the exercise of traditional law in El Salvador, which was silent in the face of the atrocities committed by the military dictatorship in those years.
