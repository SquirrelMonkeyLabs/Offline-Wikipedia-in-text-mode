 "text": "Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (11 May 1752 – 22 January 1840) was a German physician, naturalist, physiologist and anthropologist. He was one of the first to explore the study of mankind as an aspect of natural history. He used comparative anatomy to classify human races, of which he listed five. == Blumenbach's classification of races == Blumenbach divided the human species into five races in 1779. Later he based them on the anatomy of the human skull. Blumenbach's work included the description of sixty skulls published as Decas craniorum (Göttingen 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists. He called the five races (1793/1795): * the Caucasian race or white race * the Mongolian or yellow race * the Malayan or brown race * the Ethiopian, or black race * the American or red race. He did not think other races were inferior to the Caucasian race, and were potentially good members of society. Anatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other individual Africans as Europeans differ from Europeans'. Furthermore he thought that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities'.Hitt, Jack 2005.

His ideas were adopted by other researchers and encouraged scientific racism. Blumenbach's work was used by many biologists and comparative anatomists in the nineteenth century who were interested in the origin of races: Wells, Lawrence, Prichard, Huxley and William Flower are good examples of his influence on human biology. Regarding human origins, Blumenbach believed the first humans had originated in Asia.Blumenbach 1817. The Institutions of physiology.
