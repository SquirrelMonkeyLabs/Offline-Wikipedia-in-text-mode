 "text": "\"Hiyang Tannaba\" (literally, \"Boat race\") is a traditional boat race ceremony performed as a part of the religious festival of Lai Haraoba. It is generally organized in the month of November at many places including Thangapat (moat). The boats called Hiyang Hiren are regarded as invested with spiritual powers and the game is associated with religious rites. The Meiteis believe that the worship of the Hiyang Hiren will bring protection from the evils. ==Gallery== Hiyang Tannaba, a classical Meitei boat racing cultural event, performed as a part of the celebration of the Lai Haraoba festival.jpg ꯍꯤꯌꯥꯡ ꯇꯥꯟꯅꯕ꯶.jpg ꯍꯤꯍꯣꯟꯂꯤꯕꯤ ꯃꯤꯇꯩ ꯅꯤꯡꯉꯣꯜ ꯅꯤꯡꯊꯤꯖꯕꯤ.jpg ꯍꯤꯌꯥꯡ ꯇꯥꯟꯅꯕ.jpg ꯍꯤꯌꯥꯡ ꯇꯥꯟꯅꯕ꯳.jpg ꯍꯤꯌꯥꯡ ꯇꯥꯟꯅꯕ꯴.jpg ==References== ==Other websites== * https://www.traditionalsports.org/traditional-sports/asia/hiyang-tannaba- manipur-india.html * https://www.indianetzone.com/13/hiyang_tannaba.htm * http://www.manipurtourism.gov.in/indigenous-game-of-manipur/ * http://www.e-pao.net/epGallery.asp?id=7&src;=Festival/Hiyang20150921 * http://www.e-pao.net/epGallery.asp?id=9&src;=Festival/Hiyang20150921 Category:Festivals in India Category:Meitei culture",
