 "text": "Balibo is an Australian movie directed by Robert Connolly and released in 2009. It starred Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia who also was the film's producer. It based on the true story of 5 Australian news reporters working for Australian TV during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. They were murdered by the Indonesian army in the small village of Balibo. The Indonesian National Armed Forces did not want the movie shown in Indonesia, with a spokesman saying the movie could harm Indonesia's relations with East Timor and Australia. The movie was finally forbidden in Indonesia by the Film Censorship Agency. Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said the ban was to avoid a negative image of Indonesia. The Indonesian National Armed Forces supports the ban, with a spokesman saying the official version of the event is that the journalists were killed in a crossfire, and not murdered by Indonesian troops. However, this did not stop people from seeing the movie, as there were some secret cinemas set up to show it. ==References== Category:Australian movies Category:2009 movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies set in Asia",
