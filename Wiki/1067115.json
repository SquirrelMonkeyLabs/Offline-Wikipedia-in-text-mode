It was also home to the Charlotte Checkers of the ECHL from 2005 until 2010, the Charlotte Sting of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) in 2006, and the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League (AHL) from 2010 until 2015. They first started to build the stadium on July 29, 2003. The arena opened on October 21, 2005 and the first event was a sold-out concert by The Rolling Stones. The Bobcats had their first game in the arena on November 5, 2005. In the game, they defeated the Boston Celtics 107â€“105 in overtime. When the arena first opened on October 21, 2005, the arena didn't have a sponsor and was named Charlotte Bobcats Arena after the team. The name of the arena would change to Time Warner Cable Arena when Time Warner Cable was bought by Charter Communications and they then bought the naming rights for the arena on April 8, 2008. On August 17, 2016, it was announced that the arena would be renamed the Spectrum Center after the naming rights were bought by Spectrum. WWE has also hosted many shows and pay-per- views at the arena including the Vengeance in 2006, Clash of Champions in 2019 and NXT Vengeance Day in 2023. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Buildings and structures in North Carolina",
