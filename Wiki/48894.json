 "text": "An inorganic compound is a chemical compound that does not have carbonâ€“hydrogen bonds that is, it is not an organic compound. That means it is not a carbon-based compound. == Types of inorganic compounds == The division between the two types of compound is not absolute. Some carbon-containing compounds are traditionally considered inorganic. Many chemicals in nature are not compounds, but are ions. Sodium, chloride, and phosphate ions are essential for life, as are some inorganic molecules such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and oxygen. Aside from these simple ions and molecules, virtually all compounds covered by biochemistry contain carbon and can be considered organic or organometallic. Major types of inorganic compounds may include: * Minerals, such as salt, asbestos, silicates, ... * Alloys, like brass, bronze, ... * Most compounds involving non-metallic elements, like silicon, phosphorus, chlorine, oxygen, for example water == Related pages == *Inorganic chemistry Category:Chemical compounds",
