 "text": "The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) were two rounds of bilateral conferences and corresponding international treaties involving the United States and the Soviet Union, the Cold War superpowers, on the issue of arms control. The two rounds of talks and agreements were SALT I and SALT II. Negotiations commenced in Helsinki, Finland, in November 1969. SALT I led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an interim agreement between the two countries. Although SALT II resulted in an agreement in 1979, the United States Senate chose not to ratify the treaty in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan. The agreement expired on December 31, 1985 and was not renewed. ==References== Category:1969 in the United States Category:1979 in the United States Category:Cold War Category:Nuclear weapons Category:Treaties of the United States Category:Treaties of the Soviet Union Category:1960s treaties Category:1970s treaties",
