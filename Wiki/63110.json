 "text": "The dew point is the temperature where water vapor condenses into liquid water. All air holds different amounts of water vapor. The dew point shows the amount of moisture in the air. The higher the dew point is, the higher the level of moisture in the air at a given temperature. The dew point of humid air will be higher than the dew point of dry air. Condensation of water vapor starts when the temperature of air is lowered to its dew point and beyond. The dew point, like other measures of humidity, can be found from measurement taken by a hygrometer. ==Related pages== * Relative humidity == Other websites == * What is the dew point? * NOAA Dew point * dew point formula * Windows program for Heat Index, Dew Point, etc * Dew point evaporates on KPRC newscast (\"The dew point is absolutely worthless information\") * Often Needed Answers about Temp, Humidity & Dew Point from the sci.geo.meteorology Usenet newsgroup Category:Weather Category:Weather measurements",
