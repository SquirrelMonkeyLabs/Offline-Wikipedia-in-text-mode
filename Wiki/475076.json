 "text": "Pope Clement X (born Emilio Bonaventura Altieri; 13 July 1590 â€“ 22 July 1676) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 29 April 1670 to his death on 22 July 1676. He was elected pope at age 79, making him the oldest person to have been elected pope. Emilio Bonaventura Altieri was born in Rome in 1590. As Pope, he canonized and beatified many saints, supported good relations between Christian countries, and made efforts to preserve the Altieri family name by adopting the Paoluzzi family. He also created a new tax in Rome, which led to problems with ambassadors and cardinals. During his pontificate, he created 20 cardinals, including Pietro Francesco Orsini, who later became Pope Benedict XIII. Pope Clement X had the two fountains located in St. Peter's Square built near the tribune, where a monument has been built in his memory. During his papacy, the Palazzo Altieri in central Rome was fixed. On 22 July 1676, Clement X died from problems caused by gout at the age of 86. His tomb is in St. Peter's Basilica. ==References== ==Other websites== * (source of the interment information) Category:Italian popes Category:1590 births Category:1676 deaths Category:People from Rome",
