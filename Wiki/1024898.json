 "text": "Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of connections in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. Neuroplasticity was once thought by scientists who study the brain to exist only during childhood, but research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are \"plastic\") even through adulthood. However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain. ==References== Category:Brain",
