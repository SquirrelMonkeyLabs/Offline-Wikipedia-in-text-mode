 "text": "The electron neutrino ( ν ) is an elementary particle which has zero electric charge and a spin of 1⁄2. Together with the electron, it forms the first generation of leptons. It was first guessed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930. It was accounted for missing momentum and missing energy in beta decay. Later it was discovered in 1956 by a team led by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines (see Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment). Category:Elementary particles",
