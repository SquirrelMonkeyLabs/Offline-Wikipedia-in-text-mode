 "text": "In geometry, the radius of a circle or sphere, written as r, is the shortest connection between the center and the boundary. It is either the distance from the center to the perimeter (in the case of a circle), or the distance from the center to the surface (in the case of a sphere). It is half of the diameter. That is, when r is the radius and d is the diameter: r = d รท 2 d = 2 x r = r + r The relationship between the radius {\\displaystyle r} and the circumference {\\displaystyle c} of a circle is ~c = 2\\pi r. The area {\\displaystyle A} of a circle of radius {\\displaystyle r} is {\\displaystyle ~A = \\pi r^2.} ==Related pages== * Area * Covalent radius * Diameter * Radian == References == == Other websites == * Definition and properties of the radius of a circle with interactive applet Category:Geometry",
