 "text": "Tabung Harapan Malaysia (THM) was started by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on 30 May 2018. The fund lets people donate money to help the government. This was set up because many people wanted to help pay off the national debt, which was over RM1 trillion. The debt was inherited from the previous government led by Najib Razak after the general election on 9 May 2018. ==References== Category:Politics of Malaysia Category:Mahathir Mohamad",
