 "text": "A semicolon is a punctuation mark. It looks like this: ; ==Use in English== In the standard English language, a semicolon has only two uses. First, to connect two independent clauses into a single sentence without using an extra word. The semicolon is only used if the two sentences have a link. For example: \"I could tell that it was getting late; it was growing darker by the second.\" The second use of a semicolon is to separate items in a series when the items contain parenthetical elements within themselves. For example: \"The following crewmembers were on the bridge: James T. Kirk, captain of the Enterprise; Mr. Spock, first science officer; Mr. Sulu, helmsman; Mr. Scott, engineer; and Dr. McCoy, chief medical officer.\" A semicolon is also used with a conjunctive adverb when joining two clauses. In reality, this is the same as the first rule, but it looks different enough to sometimes cause concern. For example: \"huzaifa, context in which all life exists; consequently, it is more than a political issue.\" == Use in Arabic == In Arabic, the semicolon is called \"fasila manqoota\" (اصلة منقوطة in Arabic) and is written upside-down (؛). It is used to combine two sentences when one sentence is a cause and the other is a result. For example: \"Your sister did not get high marks; she didn't study.\" (Arabic: لم تحقق أختك درجات عالية؛ لأنها لم تدرس) == Use in Greek == In Greek, the question mark looks the same as the English semicolon. ==Use in Computer Programming== A semicolon is sometimes used in programming. In programming languages such as C, semicolons are used to separate logical statements. For example: int main() { int x, y; x = 1; y = 2; printf(\"X + Y = %d\", x + y); return 0; } ==References== Category:Punctuation",
