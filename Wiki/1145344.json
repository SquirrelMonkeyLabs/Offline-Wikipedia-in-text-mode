 "text": "Pratt's rocket frog (Colostethus pratti) is a frog. It lives in Colombia and Panama. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests. It lives near streams, especially on rocky ground near streams. Scientists saw the frog between 110 and 1160 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Los Katios National Park. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to streams where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. People cut down trees to make farms and get wood to build with. Bad chemicals from farms can also hurt this frog. Scientists believe the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can kill these frogs. B. dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
