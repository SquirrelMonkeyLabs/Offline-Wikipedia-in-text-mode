 "text": "The Brighton hotel bombing was an attack at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England. It happened on 12 October 1984. A time bomb was planted in the hotel by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) member Patrick Magee. The purpose was to kill Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her ministers, who were staying at the hotel for the Conservative Party conference. Patrick Magee, an IRA volunteer, stayed in the hotel under the pseudonym \"Roy Walsh\" on the weekend of 14â€“17 September. During his stay, he planted the bomb under the bath in his room. The bomb brought down a five-ton chimney stack, which crashed down through the floors into the basement. Thatcher narrowly escaped injury. Five people were killed, including the Deputy Chief Whip Sir Anthony Berry, and 31 were injured. Margaret Tebbit, wife of Norman Tebbit had to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. At 4am Thatcher gave an impromptu interview to the BBC saying that the conference would go on as usual. Marks & Spencer opened early at 8:00 am so those who had lost their clothes in the bombing could purchase replacements. The bombing was called \"the most audacious attack on a British government since the Gunpowder Plot\". It \"marked the end of an age of comparative innocence. From that day forward, all party conferences in this country have become heavily defended citadels\". ==References== Category:1984 in the United Kingdom Category:1980s building bombings Category:1980s explosions in Europe Category:1980s in England Category:1980s murders in the United Kingdom Category:Attacks on hotels Hotel bombing Category:Building bombings in England Category:Margaret Thatcher Category:Mass murder in England Category:Mass murder in the 1980s Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in the 1980s",
