It was agreed that Captain America was made under the publisher's rules, and belonged to them. This meant that Marvel won. == References == Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1941 Category:Marvel Comics adapted into movies Category:Avengers (comics) characters Category:Marvel vs. Capcom fighters Category:Fictional American people",
