 "text": "In mathematics, a divergent series is an infinite series that is not convergent, meaning that the infinite sequence of the partial sums of the series does not have a finite limit. If a series converges, the individual terms of the series must approach zero. Thus any series in which the individual terms do not approach zero diverges. However, convergence is a stronger condition: not all series whose terms approach zero converge. A counterexample is the harmonic series 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\cdots =\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{n}. The divergence of the harmonic series was proven by the medieval mathematician Nicole Oresme. Category:Mathematical analysis Category:Sequences and series",
