 "text": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise. It is set in a fictional universe with the setting of several superhero movies and television shows made by Marvel Studios, based on characters by Marvel Comics. This shared universe was shown in the movies by using the same characters or mentioning the same events. For example, Tony Stark appears at the end of The Incredible Hulk (2008), even though he has nothing to do with the rest of the story. This is the same way that the comic books were linked into the same universe. The franchise also includes television series, short movies, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The franchise has been commercially successful, becoming the highest-grossing franchise of all time, and has generally received a positive critical response. It has inspired other movie and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared universes. The MCU has been the focus of other media, outside of the shared universe, including attractions at various Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, an attraction at Discovery Times Square, a Queensland Gallery of Modern Art exhibit, television specials, guidebooks for each movie, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials. == Movies == The movies in the MCU are organized in sections called Phases. Phase One began in 2008 with the release of Iron Man and ended in 2012 with the release of The Avengers. Phase Two began in 2013 with the release of Iron Man 3 and ended in 2015 with the release of Ant-Man. Phase Three began in 2016 with the release of Captain America: Civil War and ended in 2019 with the release of Spider-Man: Far From Home. The first of the three phases in the franchise are collectively known as \"The Infinity Saga\". Phase Four began with the release of Black Widow in 2021 and ended with the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in 2022. Phase Five began with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in 2023 and will end with the release of Thunderbolts* in 2025. Phase Six will begin with The Fantastic Four: First Steps in 2025 and will end with the release of Avengers: Secret Wars in 2027. The second of the three phases are collectively known as \"The Multiverse Saga\". == TV series and specials == Marvel Television expanded the universe to network television with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC in 2013, followed by streaming television with Daredevil on Netflix in 2015 and Runaways on Hulu in 2017, and cable television with Cloak & Dagger on Freeform in 2018. Marvel Television produced the digital series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot. Marvel Studios themselves expanded to streaming with Disney+, starting with WandaVision in 2021 as the beginning of Phase Four. They also produced television specials known as Marvel Studios Special Presentations, starting with Werewolf by Night (2022) in Phase Four. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the movies and many of the television series, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the movies. The MCU includes tie-in comics published by Marvel Comics, while Marvel Studios has produced a series of direct-to-video short movies, called Marvel One-Shots, and a viral marketing campaign for its movies and the universe with the faux news program WHIH Newsfront. ==Shorts== Movie U.S. release date Director Screenwriter Producer Home media release The Consultant September 13, 2011 Leythum Eric Pearson Kevin Feige Thor A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer October 25, 2011 Captain America: The First Avenger Item 47 September 25, 2012 Louis D'Esposito Marvel's The Avengers Agent Carter September 3, 2013 (digital) September 24, 2013 (physical) Iron Man 3 All Hail the King February 4, 2014 (digital) February 25, 2014 (physical) Drew Pearce Thor: The Dark World Team Thor August 28, 2016 (digital) September 13, 2016 (physical) Taika Waititi Captain America: Civil War Team Thor: Part 2 February 14, 2017 (digital) February 28, 2017 (physical) Doctor Strange Team Darryl February 20, 2018 (digital) March 6, 2018 (physical) Thor: Ragnarok Peter's To-Do List September 17, 2019 (digital) October 1, 2019 (physical) Jon Watts Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal Spider-Man: Far From Home ==Web series== Web Series Season Episodes Air Dates WHIH Newsfront 1 5 July 2, 2015 - July 16, 2015 2 5 April 22, 2016 - May 3, 2016 Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot 1 6 December 13, 2016 == Recurring cast and characters == List indicator(s) This section includes characters who will appear or have appeared in at least three MCU movies/series and received main billing credit in at least two franchises. * An empty, grey cell indicates the character was not in the media, or that the character's presence has not yet been confirmed. * A P indicates an appearance in onscreen photographs. * A V indicates a voice-only role.
