 "text": "Megophryidae are a large family of frogs. They live in the warm southeast of Asia, from the Himalaya foothills eastwards, south to Indonesia and the Greater Sunda Islands in Maritime Southeast Asia, and going to the Philippines. There are 70-100 species of frog divided between 12 genera. They are commonly called megophryids. The megophryids are known for their camouflage, especially those that live in forests. They often look like dead leaves. They even have some skin folds that look like leaf veins. Megophryids range in size from to in length. The adults' tongue is noticeably paddle- shaped. Their tadpoles can be found in a variety of waters, but especially ponds and streams. The tadpoles are very diverse in form because of the variety of habitats they live in. ==Genera== Family Megophryinidae * Atympanophrys * Borneophrys - Rough horned frogs Delorme, Dubois, Grosjean & Ohler, 2006 (formerly in Megophrys) * Brachytarsophrys - Karin Hills frogs * Leptobrachella - Borneo frogs * Leptobrachium - Eastern spadefoot toads * Leptolalax - Asian toads * Megophrys - Asian horned toads * Ophryophryne - Mountain toads * Oreolalax * Scutiger - Cat-eyed toads * Vibrissaphora - Spiny toads (sometimes included in Leptobrachium) * Xenophrys ==References== * (2004): Encyclopedia of Reptiles & Amphibians (2nd ed.).
