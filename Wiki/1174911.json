 "text": "The Argentine Army, () is the land force branch of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic and the senior military service of Argentina. Founded in 1810, constitutes together with the Navy and the Air Force, the defense to reject military aggressions of external origin, although the legislation allows the subsidiary use of military elements in support of internal security, the restoration of order in military jurisdiction, or the restoration of order in the internal sphere, after declaration of a state of siege. In addition, it provides support to the community in the event of an emergency and catastrophe, deploys troops in peacekeeping operations within the framework of the UN and provides logistical support to the Argentine presence in Antarctica. The Army is subordinate to the President of Argentina as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. == History == Several armed expeditions were sent to the Upper Peru (now Bolivia), Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile to fight Spanish forces and secure Argentina's newly gained independence. The most famous of these expeditions was the one led by General José de San Martín, who led a 5000-man army across the Andes Mountains to expel the Spaniards from Chile and later from Perú. While the other expeditions failed in their goal of bringing all the dependencies of the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata under the new government in Buenos Aires, they prevented the Spaniards from crushing the rebellion. During the civil wars of the first half of the nineteenth century, the Argentine Army became fractionalized under the leadership of the so-called caudillos (\"leaders\" or \"warlords\"), provincial leaders who waged a war against the centralist Buenos Aires administration. However, the Army was briefly re- unified during the war with the Brazilian Empire (1824–1827). It was only with the establishment of a constitution (which explicitly forbade the provinces from maintaining military forces of their own) and a national government recognized by all the provinces that the Army became a single force, absorbing the older provincial militias. The Army went on to fight the War of the Triple Alliance in the 1860s together with Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay. After that war, the Army became involved in Argentina's Conquista del Desierto (\"Conquest of the Desert\"): the campaign to occupy Patagonia and root out the natives, who conducted looting raids throughout the country. == References == === Citations ===",
