 "text": "The Khmer Rouge was a communist militant group in Cambodia that took over the country in 1975. * * * * * It was overthrown in the 1979 Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, aided by Cambodian defectors. ==Overview== Under the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia became a totalitarianist state. The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the Cambodian genocide, which claimed the lives of 3,000,000 ( of the Cambodian population at the time). ==History== The Khmer Rouge took over the capital city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, on 17 April 1975. They named the country Democratic Kampuchea. Their leader was Pol Pot (formerly called Saloth Sar). Immediately, they forced everyone out of the cities and effectively turned the whole country into a giant labor camp. The Khmer Rouge were defeated by the Vietnamese in January 1979. However, the international community continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge as the government of Kampuchea for a decade after they were defeated. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge held a seat in the United Nations until 1989. In 1999, the Khmer Rouge disbanded. As per Henri Locard:Locard, Henri 2005.

On 17 April 1975, the Khmer Rouge captured Cambodia's capital city, Phnom Penh, and took control of the country. They renamed the country as the Democratic Kampuchea and began the Cambodian genocide. ==Beliefs== The Khmer Rouge were a \"fanatical Communist movement ... which imposed a ruthless agenda of forced labor, thought control and mass execution\" across Cambodia. Most members were teenage peasant boys. The Khmer Rouge believed the people in Cambodia's cities had been poisoned and corrupted by the ideas of Western capitalism. They wanted to return Cambodia to \"Year Zero,\" a time when everybody in the country was a rural farmer. They thought this would create an agrarian socialist utopia - a perfect, farm-based society without social classes, where people would share everything. They objected to the existence of money, free markets or educated professions (e.g. medicine, engineering, law and teaching). To the Khmer Rouge, being a poor farm worker was the only acceptable lifestyle. They viewed educated people as a fundamental threat to communism. ==Victims== Historians cannot say exactly how many people were killed in the Cambodian genocide. Most estimates say that between 1,400,000 and 3,000,000 Cambodian people were killed. This was between 20% and 33% of Cambodia's population back then. In his 2005 article, Henri Locard wrote: > Between 17 April 1975 and 7 January 1979 the death toll was about 25% of a > population of some 7.8 million; 33.5% of men were massacred or died > unnatural deaths [and so did] 15.7% of the women ... 41.9% of the population > of Phnom Penh [was killed]. ==Cambodian genocide denial== ===Academia=== On the debate about the Cambodian genocide, American political scientist Donald W. Beachler remarked,Beachler, Donald W. (2009) \"Arguing about Cambodia: Genocide and Political Interest\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies 23(2):214–38. Despite the abundance of verified testimonies from Cambodian refugees and foreign witnesses, Cambodian genocide denial within academia was widespread in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia etc. ====Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman==== With the transnational academic-cultural network tied to their prominence in Western academia, American scholars Noam Chomsky (1928 – ) and Edward S. Herman (1925 – 2017) published several books discrediting the survivors, objecting to the genocide classification and the confirmed death toll of the Cambodian genocide, * * * * which influenced hundreds of millions worldwide into doing the same. ====Gareth Porter==== In 1976, American historian Gareth Porter (1942 – ) co-authored the book Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution with George Hildebrand in which he denied that one million Cambodians had already been killed by the Khmer Rouge. On May 3, 1977, Porter repeated his denial at the Solarz hearing in the U.S. Congress.Human Rights in Cambodia.\" Hearing Before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, 95th Congress, 1st Session. 1977 May 3. Also available via Google Books. Historians have been critical of Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution. Particularly, Historians have been critical of Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution. Particularly, historian Bruce Sharp researched the citations of that book. Of the 50 citations in a chapter of that book, 33 were traced to Khmer Rouge state propaganda, while 6 from that of the CCP, which served as a proof of their confirmation bias and intellectual dishonesty. Recalling the encounter later in his life, Solarz called Porter's Cambodian genocide denial \"cowardly and contemptible,\" comparing him to those who denied the Holocaust.Thompson, Larry Clinton. 2010. Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975–1982. Jefferson, NC: MacFarland. ====Samir Amin==== Egyptian-French economist Samir Amin had been a good friend of Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan since they were studying in France in the Cold War's early years. When the Cambodian genocide was exposed, Amin continued to hail the Khmer Rouge as the most superior communist model. When asked again about the Cambodian genocide in 1986, Amin retorted with an inversion of reality by blaming the \"American imperialists\", the Vietnamese communists, and Lon Nol for the suffering of the Cambodians. ===Responses=== ====François Ponchaud==== François Ponchaud (1939 – ) is a French priest who lived in Cambodia during the genocide. As a witness, he documented the genocide in his book Cambodge Année Zéro (Cambodia: Year Zero), which attracted biased criticism from Noam Chomsky and Gareth Porter who denied the genocide. In response, Ponchaud called out their intellectual dishonesty, ====Sophal Ear==== Cambodian-American historian Sophal Ear satirically referred to the biased narrative of pro-Khmer Rouge Western academic leftists as the Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia (STAV), ====William Shawcross==== British journalist William Shawcross criticized the STAV academics as well. His criticism was endorsed by human rights activist David Hawk who pointed out that ====Jakob Guhl==== Jakob Guhl, the Senior Manager, Policy and Research of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said that Cambodian genocide denial among Western academic leftists was rooted in their dogmatic rejection of liberal democracy, presumption of \"moral superiority\" of anti-capitalist regimes and division of political actors into binary categories (oppressors vs. oppressed) to justify \"anti-hierarchical aggression\" towards hypothetical oppressors, who are dehumanized to have their suffering denied. ==The Khmer Rouge Military and Khmer Rouge Secret Police (1975-1979)== The Revolutionary Army Of Cambodia or the Khmer Rouge Military was the official military that control Democratic Kampuchea’s Army (Revolutionary Ground Army of Cambodia) Air Force (Revolutionary Air Force of Cambodia) and the Navy (Revolutionary Navy of Cambodia) from 1975-1979 it originally was a partisan army during Cambodian Civil War from 1967-1975 . But however when the Khmer Rouge Military invaded Vietnam the Khmer Rouge Military didn’t have any good infantry troops or tanks artillery armoured trains to transport infantry or planes and helicopters or boats for paratroopers or marine infantry due to Pol Pot wanting to deindustrialise Cambodia when the Cambodian–Vietnamese War began in 1978/1979 . The Khmer Rouge also had a secret police called the Santebal which controlled Security Prison 21 from 1975-1979 . * Holodomor * Totalitarianism * The Holocaust ==Notelist== ==References== Category:History of Asia Category:Cambodian genocide Category:Communist parties in Asia Category:1999 disestablishments in Asia",
