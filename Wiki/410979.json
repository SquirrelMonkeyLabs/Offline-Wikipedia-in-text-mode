With his deep voice and mature countenance, he played an eclectic mix of characters over the span of his career. Platt was born on February 14, 1916 in Staten Island, New York City. He studied at Juilliard School of Music and at Princeton University. Platt was married to Suzanne Belcher from 1954 until his death in 1974. They had four children. Platt died on March 19, 1974 in Santa Monica, California from a heart attack, aged 58. However, one of his sons confirmed that Platt committed suicide after two previous attempts while suffering from an undiagnosed and untreated depression that was further sparked by financial troubles. It is also said that Platt's Get Smart co-star Don Adams knew the real cause of death. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * \"Chief\" places 6th on Great Secondary TV Characters list Category:1916 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Actors from Staten Island Category:American movie actors Category:American stage actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Princeton University alumni",
