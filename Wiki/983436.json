 "text": "According to the New Testament, a woven crown of thorns ( or ) was placed on the head of Jesus during the events leading up to his crucifixion. It was one of the instruments of the Passion, used by Jesus' captors both to cause him pain and to mock his claim of authority. It is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew (Matthew 27:29), Mark (Mark 15:17) and John (John 19:2, 19:5),, and is often alluded to by the early Church Fathers, such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen and others, and was referenced in the apocryphal Gospel of Peter. == References == Category:New Testament",
