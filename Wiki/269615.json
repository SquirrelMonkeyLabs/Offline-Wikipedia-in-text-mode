 "text": "A boiled egg is an egg boiled in its shell. This is a common way of cooking eggs. If the shells are broken, it is called a poached egg. There are two different types of boiled eggs: hard boiled eggs and soft-boiled eggs. ==Hard- boiled eggs== Hard-boiled eggs are completely cooked. The egg yolk is solid. They can be eaten warm or cold. Some dishes use them like egg salad. They can be stored for a long time in the refrigerator. Some machines called egg slicers can slice these easily. ==Soft-boiled eggs== Soft-boiled eggs have firmly cooked eggwhites, while at the same time, the yolks are liquid. They can have salmonella in them if you don't prepare them correctly. In Europe, soft-boiled eggs are a traditional breakfast cuisine, and you normally scoop them out of the shell and eat. In Asia, the soft-boiled egg is cracked into a cup with soy sauce and black pepper. To make the perfect soft-boiled egg, bring the water up to a boil, then lower it to a rapid simmer. Add the eggs to the pot, and then begin timing. If you're just cooking one or two eggs, five minutes is perfect for a runny yolk, or cook as long as seven minutes for a more firmly set, but still spoonable, yolk. ==Related pages== *Fried egg Category:Egg dishes",
