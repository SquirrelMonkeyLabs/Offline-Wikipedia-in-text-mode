The Metropolitan Line of the London Underground connects it with central London. It is generally not considered part of Greater London. In 2011, about 24,000 people lived in Rickmansworth. The city grew a lot in the 1920s and 1930s. This growth was also due to the good connections the Metropolitan Line provided. This led to urbanization. Today it is mostly a commuter town.
