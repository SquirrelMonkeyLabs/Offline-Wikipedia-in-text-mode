 "text": "The 1914-15 Austrian football championship was the first season of the Austrian Bundesliga during the First World war. All football games were canceled in August 1914, including the autumn championship that had already been drawn. The team's players disappeared into the military troops. It was decided to hold the competition in just one round in the spring of 1915. The sporting value remains questionable. Some clubs were obviously able to \"manage\" to get their players back from the front in time of a match. Others (especially the Wiener Sport-Club) had almost all of their players in the war and played most of their games with youth teams.Austrian Soccer Wiener AC won the title for the first time. ==Table== Table mode (if points are tied):Number of wins - goal quotient Pl.
