It is a reboot of the previous Garfield movies and the sixth installment. The film was released on May 24, 2024. It received negative reviews from critics. ==Plot== Garfield is an overweight, lazy, orange cat who lives a pampered lifestyle with a beagle dog, Odie, and their owner, Jon Arbuckle. One night, while getting a midnight snack, Garfield and Odie are kidnapped by two dogs named Roland and Nolan, who take them to an abandoned mall as hostages. Garfield and Odie are soon rescued by Garfield's estranged father, Vic, who Garfield hates for abandoning him in an alley when he was just a kitten. The dogs' boss Jinx, a vindictive Persian cat, arrives to exact revenge on Vic for leaving her behind during a milk heist at Lactose Farms before she was caught and imprisoned. She agrees to forgive Vic if he, Garfield, and Odie break in Lactose Farms to steal a large quantity of milk as repayment for her imprisonment, which they reluctantly agree, boarding a train to the farm while Roland and Nolan follow. Vic attempts to bond with Garfield to no avail. The three reach Lactose Farms, which is heavily guarded by an advanced security system. They meet Otto, a bull and the farm's former mascot, who was forced out after a corporation took over the farm. They agree to help get his girlfriend Ethel, who was separated from him following the take-over, out of the farm if he helps them get in. While working on a break-in plan, Vic reveals that he was getting food for Garfield when he saw him being taken care of by Jon. Knowing Jon would be a better parent than he ever could, Vic decided to let Jon adopt Garfield, and kept his distance from him, watching from afar. Meanwhile, Jinx, unwilling to let go of her grudge against Vic, secretly calls the farm's animal control officer, Marge Malone, to inform her about the heist, with the intention of betraying the trio. The trio successfully infiltrate the farm, but Marge intercepts them and captures Garfield and Odie. Vic reluctantly leaves them behind, stealing the milk truck. Garfield and Odie are taken to the pound, where they meet Vic's old heist crew. However, they have long distanced themselves from him as he was constantly leaving their capers to check up on Garfield. Jon soon arrives and takes Garfield and Odie back home. Garfield finds Vic's markings on a tree across the house whenever he visits him, realizing that Vic only left him behind to keep him safe. Garfield decides to go back and save him. Vic, meanwhile, is betrayed by Jinx, intending to throw him off a bridge from a train. Garfield and Odie arrive to rescue him with Otto's help. Seeing Vic's love for his son, Roland and Nolan turn on Jinx. Outraged, Jinx pushes them off the train, but she herself gets knocked off by an overpass. Otto swings a rope to save them and safely lands them on a net set up by Odie. They bring in Jinx to Marge in exchange for Ethel's release, reuniting her with Otto, and Roland and Nolan begin working as guard dogs for Marge while Jinx ends up working community service under her. At Jon's house, Garfield reconciles with Vic, and Vic moves in with the trio. == Voice cast == * Chris Pratt as Garfield, a sarcastic and lazy orange tabby cat who loves lasagna and hates Mondays. * Samuel L.
