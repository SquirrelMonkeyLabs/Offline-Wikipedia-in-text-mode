 "text": "The term crested penguin is the common name of species of penguins of the genus Eudyptes. All are black and white penguins with yellow crests, red bills and eyes. They are found on subantarctic islands in the world's southern oceans. All lay two eggs, but raise only one young per breeding season. The first egg laid is much smaller than the second. Different experts disagree on how many species there are. They include the rockhopper penguins. A Chatham Islands species may have become extinct in the 19th century. == References == Category:Penguins",
