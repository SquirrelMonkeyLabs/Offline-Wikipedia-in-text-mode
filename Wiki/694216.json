 "text": "The National Constituent Assembly was the first revolutionary government formed by the rebellious peasants in the French Revolution. During an Estates General meeting, Louis XVI, the king of France at the time, removed the peasants from the room to try and cool the disruption they caused. The peasants, who were angry, went to a nearby indoor tennis court in Versailles. They swore the Tennis Court Oath, their unanimous agreement on the creation of a new form of government for France: The National Constituent Assembly. This was a semi-democratic form of government that focused mainly on popular vote. Category:French Revolution Category:1780s in France",
