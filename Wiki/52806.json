Campbell-Bannerman was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1836 as Henry Campbell. The surname Bannerman was added to his surname in 1871 as required by his uncle's will. It was a requirement of his inheritance of his uncle's Kent estate, Hunton Court. Seriously ill by the time of his resignation as Prime Minister, he died just nineteen days later. He remains the most recent Prime Minister to die in 10 Downing Street.
