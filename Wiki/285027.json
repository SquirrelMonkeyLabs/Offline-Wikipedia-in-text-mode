 "text": "The Chevrolet Cruze is a four-door sedan and hatchback that is built by General Motors' Chevrolet brand. A subcompact Cruze based on the Suzuki Ignis was built between 2001 and 2008. Since 2008, the current compact has been produced as a replacement for the Chevrolet Cobalt. The Cruze is actually a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti Premiere, prior to its introduction, the original model was sold under Suzuki in America. The Cruze is the first compact Chevrolet model to not have a Pontiac twin, instead it shares similarities with the Buick Verano. In 2016 (2014 in China), the Cruze received a new generation. The Cruze was discontinued in the Americas in 2020. In the US, the Cruze is available with either a 1.8-liter or 1.4-liter 4-cylinder engine producing 138 hp. Both are available with six-speed manual and automatic transmissions. GM has announced that in late 2016 a hatchback version of the Cruze will be offered in North America. ==Other websites== * Chevrolet Cruze Reviews & Pictures * Official Site Cruze Category:Sedans Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles Category:2020s automobiles",
