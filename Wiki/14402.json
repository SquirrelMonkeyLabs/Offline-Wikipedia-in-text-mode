 "text": "Hurricane Katrina was one of the deadliest hurricanes to ever hit the United States and the second Category 5 hurricane of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. == Storm history == The storm formed over the Bahamas on August 23, where it moved west and hit south Florida as a Category 1 hurricane two days later. Katrina then crossed over Florida and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane moving west in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm then turned north, had an eyewall replacement cycle, and hit east Louisiana and Mississippi, flooding coastal areas on the morning of August 29. The leftovers of Katrina then died out over the Great Lakes on August 31. == Impact == 80% of New Orleans was flooded when the levees protecting the city broke. Most of the people killed by Katrina were thought to have died from drowning. Many of the survivors had swum to higher roofs or tree branches. ==Related pages== * 2005 Atlantic hurricane season * Hurricane Rita * Meteorological history of Hurricane Katrina * Hurricane Katrina tornado outbreak * National Weather Service bulletin for New Orleans region * List of hurricanes in Florida == References == == Other websites == * National Hurricane Center's Tropical Cyclone Report on Hurricane Katrina * National Hurricane Center's archive on Hurricane Katrina * Hurricane Katrina Rainfall Information from HPC * Hydro- meteorological Prediction Center's * NASA's Hurricane Katrina Archive * Geology and Hurricane-Protection Strategies in the Greater New Orleans Area Louisiana Geological Survey publication on Hurricane Katrina Category:2005 in the United States Category:Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes Category:George W.
