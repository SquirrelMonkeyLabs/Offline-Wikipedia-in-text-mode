The Planet Express crew is unhappy of the two's robosexual relationship. Amy was brought to Mars by her parents and Bender was brought to the Church of Robotology where they try to stop being robosexuals. Bender decides to marry Amy, to Farnsworth's frustration given that robosexual marriage is illegal with the exception of Space Massachusetts. The two decide to create Proposition Infinity to legalize robosexual marriage. Professor Farnsworth opposed the proposition and he and Bender started a debate. Farnsworth remembered dating a scientist named Eunice and saw her sleeping with a robot. He revealed that Eunice was actually a robot named Unit 47. As a result, Farnsworth gave up the debate and robosexual marriage became legal. ==Reception== It is one of Executive producer David X. Cohen's favorite episodes.
