 "text": "A spitting spider is a spider in the family Scytodidae. There are more than 150 species of spitting spider in the world. Spitting spiders are related to the recluse spiders in the Sicariidae family. The name spitting spider comes from the way these spiders hunt. The spider spits a sticky and poisonous liquid at its prey. The liquid congeals (becomes solid) around the target. When the prey is trapped, the spider bites it to kill it with venom. It then wraps the prey in spider silk like many other spiders do.Gilbert, C. and L. S . Rayor. 1985. Predatory behavior of spitting spiders (Araneae, Scytodidae) and the evolution of prey wrapping.
