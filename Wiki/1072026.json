The book was published in 1997 from Darul Bukhari, Madina Munawara and later in 2002 from Maktabur Rushd, Saudi Arabia. The book is one of the major texts on Hinduism and Indian religion in the field of Islamic studies. This book provides a scientific study of the four major religions of India, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, from an Islamic perspective. In the book, the author claims, these three religions have similarities and their foundations are mostly based on ancient beliefs, ideas and customs. ==History== This book is actually a collection of the author's articles, which were published in Madinah Islamic University's \"Magjalat Al Jamiat Al- Islamiyya Bil Madinah Al Munawara (Madinah Islamic University Magazine)\". and then when he was appointed as a professor at the University of Madinah, he was also responsible for teaching \"Adiyan al-Alam (World Religions)\". Among other things, when entrusted with this responsibility, he prepared the text of \"Religion\" from the articles and then rearranged these articles for public use and published them in book form. Now these two books deal with \"religion\", namely \"Judaism and Christianity\" (دراست في اليهودية و أديان النصرانية) and \"The Religion of India\", published in one volume titled Dirasat Fil Yahudiyat wal Masihiyat wal Adianil Hind (دراسات في اليهودية والمسيحية وأديان الهند, Studies in Jewish, Christian and Indian Religions/Comparative Study of Judaism, Christianity and Indian Religions), containing 784 pages, it is being published by Maktabat Al-Rushd, a famous printing house in Saudi Arabia, due to the similarity of the content and so far it has had seven editions. The institution publishes this book every year as it is very popular among the teachers and students of the local Islamic Universities. ==Contents== ===Hinduism=== In the book Azami says about Hinduism, the Kol race lived in Mohenjodaro in India in the third century BC, the Turanians came and defeated them and mixed with them, the Dravid race arose, who Mohenjodaro in Sindh. They settled in the Harappan city and then spread into South India, and they divided into four groups according to their language, Kannada, Malayam, Tamil and Telugu. During this time they continued to clash with the Aryans from the east of the Indus for several centuries, and the name Hindu was given by the Greeks and Iranians to this Indus (Sindh) word. The inhabitants accepted their allegiance and then the Aryans began to mold the social system and the inhabitants of India entered the Vedic society. Azmi cites archaeological similarities as well as linguistic similarities between Sanskrit and Persian, suggesting that the Aryans were of European Persian origin, and he cites linguistics to suggest that the Sanskrit-speaking Aryans and the Persian- speaking were inhabitants of the same territory, and that they came from Persia. At one point when the Aryans won, the local inhabitants including the Dravidians accepted their allegiance, then the Aryans began to shape the social system and the inhabitants of India entered the Vedic society. Azmi cites archaeological similarities as well as linguistic similarities between Sanskrit and Persian, suggesting that the Aryans were of European Persian origin, and he cites linguistics to suggest that the Sanskrit-speaking Aryans and the Persian-speaking were inhabitants of the same territory, and that they came from Persia.The Aryans then divided the natives of India into four classes in order of status, these being Brahmins (Arya priests or clerics), Kshatriyas (Rajput warriors or Marathas), Vaishya (Turani Dravidian traders or traders and farmers) and Shudra (Turani Dravidian laborers or labourers), the first two being the Aryan upper caste and the latter two the Dravidian lower caste. According to Azmi, among them, the Shudras were persecuted and disrespected by the Aryans, and in the 20th century they converted en masse, and a large number of people converted to Islam, especially the Dalit communities in various places, including Tamil Nadu, whose voluntary conversion to Islam was received coverage from the Indian press , whuch Azmi cites numerous sources with quotations including of Babasaheb Ambedkar. Hindus then concentrated on writing texts which were divided into five eras. respectively: # The four Vedas were composed in the first age. According to Azmi, Vedic culture was the product of a mixture of Aryan and local Dravidian cultures. Besides, he rejects the conventional idea of claiming the Vedas as an Abrahamic sahifah book with his own arguments. # In the second period, Hindu philosophers wrote the Upanishads, which incorporated the basic concepts of Sufism or Tasawwuf, Associated with him were Mansur Hallaj, Ibn Arabi and Sarmad Kashani, who together with Nirban and Om composed Wahdat al-Ojud, also Ibn Habit, Ahmad Ibn Namus, Abu Muslim Khorasani and Muhammad Ibn Zakariya Razi propagated the idea of reincarnation described in Hinduism in the name of Islam. Also at this time, an Upanishad called Allah Upanishad was written during the reign of the Emperor of India Jalal Uddin Akbar, where the concept of God in Islam is discussed. # Compendium of religious practices was prepared in the third period. Smriti books were written during this time, among which Manusmriti is the most notable. # The Aryan gods started disappearing due to the fusion of the Aryans with the inhabitants of India during the fourth period. The Aryas worshiped Indra as the god of thunder, Agni as the god of fire, Aruna as the god of the sky and Usha as the god of the morning. But later Vishnu as the god of sustenance and Shiva as the god of destruction took their place and the Puranic books were written praising these gods. At various places in the books, the story of creation, resurrection and the time between the two Manus and the time between the two destructions of the universe are given. According to Hindu belief this universe is imperishable. It is destroyed and created anew many times. Azmi also claims that, since the Aryan migration took place through Egypt and Syria during the time of the Christian Saint Paul, the Aryans were later influenced by the Christian trinitarianism developed by Saint Paul to develop a triune divine concept consisting of Vishnu, Brahma and Mahadeva (Shiva). # In the fifth age, the Mahabharata, the Gita and the Ramayana were composed, which contain accounts of the battles of the Aryan leaders and their victories in war. In addition, Hindu scriptures are said to contain descriptions of various Islamic gospels, including the arrival of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which Muhammad Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti and Sanaullah Amritsari and many others in the 20th century. wrote the book in the beginning, Azmi said that according to the consensus of Muslims, the Hindu scriptures Asmani Kitab may be that when the Aryans left their native land, Ibrahim was in Iraq. Azmi claims more support for the second view that the religion emerged and either the Aryans adopted these from the Torah and the Sahifas of Abraham when they passed through the region, or the Hindus, when revising their texts, inserted them to satisfy Muslim rulers during Islamic rule. Azmi says about the religion of Hinduism, Azmi says that the reason behind Hindus' negative perception of Islam is, ==Receiption== Abubakar Muhammad Zakaria in his book Hindusiat wa Tasur Bad al-Firak al-Islamiyat Biha () (Hinduism and Islamic Tribes Influenced by It), which he initially composed as a thesis, he took the direct help of his teacher Ziaur Rahman Azmi and also followed Azmi's this book \"Fusulun fi Adianil Hind\" closely. ==Related pages== * Mahishashur Jayanti * Santali interpretation of Mahishasura * Al-Hindusiat wa Tasur Bad al-Firak al-Islamiyat Biha ==References== ==Other websites== * Fusulun Fi Adianil Hind in Islamhouse.com Category:Islamic literature Category:Hinduism and Islam Category:1997 books Category:Cultural depictions of Muhammad Category:Books by Ziaur Rahman Azmi",
