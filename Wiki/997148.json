 "text": "Vector control serves as an important cross-cutting activity that aims to enhance the impact of other strategic interventions, with specific focus on prevention of selected neglected tropical diseases whose transmission cycle relies on vectors or intermediate hosts. Vector control is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds, insects or other arthropods which transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is mosquito control using a variety of strategies. Several of the \"neglected tropical diseases\" are spread by such vectors. Insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, Lethal ovitraps and repellents can be used to control vectors. For example, larvicides can be used in mosquito breeding zones; insecticides can be applied to house walls or bed nets, and use of personal repellents can reduce incidence of insect bites and thus infection. Vector control is a highly effective way to reduce malaria transmission and is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies. WHO currently recommends deployment of either insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying for malaria vector control in most areas at risk of malaria. Vector control is crucial to reduce the incidence of infection from diseases; this is especially important for those for which there is currently no effective cure or preventive medical measures available, such as Dengue, West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus. Vectors, as defined by the California Department of Public Health, are â€œany insect or other arthropod, rodent or other animal of public health significance capable of harboring or transmitting the causative agents of human disease, or capable of causing human discomfort and injury.\" Category:Pests Category:Epidemiology",
