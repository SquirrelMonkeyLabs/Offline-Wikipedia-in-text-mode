 "text": "Molecular subtyping of cancer, as its name suggests, is a new way to classify cancers into different groups based on molecular data and classification models. Unlike the traditional histological classification of cancer, molecular classifications rely on biomarkers and classifiers. Biomarkers can be genes, microRNAs (miRNAs), DNA methylation markers and others. Classifiers can be built by machine learning algorithms, such as Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and more. Biomarkers can be informative genes. ==References== Category:Cancer",
