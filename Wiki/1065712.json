 "text": "The common shrub frog (Pseudophilautus popularis) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it between 0 and 1067 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 17.7 – 21.3 mm long in from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 23.0 – 25.6 mm long when her body is full of eggs. The top of the frog's head and back are brown in color. The sides of the body are dark brown or black in color with some white or light blue marks. The area near where the back legs meet the body is gray-brown in color. The area around the eardrum has blue dots. The legs are brown with darker brown stripes across. The belly is gray-brown in color. The bottoms of the back legs are yellow in color. The webbed skin on the feet is yellow in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities and because pollution, chemicals that make crops grow, and chemicals that kill pests can also kill the frog. Scientists have seen that one of the places where the frog lives, Bellanwila-Attidiya sanctuary, is a protected park. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
