 "text": "The Football Association Community Shield (formerly the Charity Shield) is English football's yearly match held at Wembley Stadium. It is played between the winners of the previous Premier League season and the holders of the FA Cup. If the Premier League winners also won the FA Cup, then the league second-place finishers are the opponents. The fixture is recognised as a competitive super cup by the Football Association and UEFA. ==Winners== ===By number of wins (clubs)=== Team Wins (outright wins/shared titles) Years (* title was shared) Manchester United 21 (17/4) 1908, 1911, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1965*, 1967*, 1977*, 1983, 1990*, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016 Arsenal 16 (15/1) 1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1948, 1953, 1991*, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2023 Liverpool 16 (11/5) 1964*, 1965*, 1966, 1974, 1976, 1977*, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1986*, 1988, 1989, 1990*, 2001, 2006, 2022 Everton 9 (8/1) 1928, 1932, 1963, 1970, 1984, 1985, 1986*, 1987, 1995 Tottenham Hotspur 7 (4/3) 1921, 1951, 1961, 1962, 1967*, 1981*, 1991* Manchester City 7 1937, 1968, 1972, 2012, 2018, 2019, 2024 Chelsea 4 1955, 2000, 2005, 2009 Wolverhampton Wanderers 4 (1/3) 1949*, 1954*, 1959, 1960* Leeds United 2 1969, 1992 West Bromwich Albion 2 (1/1) 1920, 1954* Burnley 2 (1/1) 1960*, 1973 Newcastle United 1 1909 Brighton & Hove Albion 1 1910 Blackburn Rovers 1 1912 Huddersfield Town 1 1922 Cardiff City 1 1927 Sheffield Wednesday 1 1935 Sunderland 1 1936 Bolton Wanderers 1 1958 Leicester City 1 1971 Derby County 1 1975 Nottingham Forest 1 1978 Portsmouth 1 (0/1) 1949* West Ham United 1 (0/1) 1964* Aston Villa 1 (0/1) 1981* ===By number of wins (other)=== Team Wins Years English Professionals XI 4 1913, 1923, 1924, 1929 English Amateurs XI 2 1925, 1926 England 1950 FIFA World Cup XI 1 1950 ==Winners and runners-up by competition== Competition Wins Shared Runners-up First Division/Premier League (*53, including 6 as double winners) 1908, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1928, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1948, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2018, 2019 (*11, including 1 as double winner) 1949, 1954, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1977, 1981, 1986, 1990, 1991 (*22, including 2 as double winners) 1910, 1921, 1922, 1930, 1935, 1958, 1962, 1974, 1983, 1984, 1989, 1995, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 FA Cup (*26, including 6 as double winners) 1921, 1922, 1927, 1930, 1935, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1974, 1983, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 (*11, including 1 as double winner) 1949, 1954, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1977, 1981, 1986, 1990, 1991 (*44, including 2 as double winners) 1928, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1948, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1963, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2018 First Division/Premier League runners-up (or other positions in brackets) (*3) 1972(4th), 1999, 2010 (*1) 1986 (*5) 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2019 FA Cup runners-up — — (*1) 1971 Defending champions of the Charity Shield — — (*1) 1973 Champions of lower-tier leagues (tier in brackets) (*2) 1971(2), 1973(2) — (*2) 1920(2), 1972(3) Southern League (*1) 1910 — (*4) 1908, 1909, 1911, 1912 Professionals (*4) 1913, 1923, 1924, 1929 — (*2) 1925, 1926 Amateurs (*2) 1925, 1926 — (*4) 1913, 1923, 1924, 1929 Others (*1) 1950 — (*3) 1927, 1950, 1961 ;Notes ==References== ==Other websites== * Official site at TheFA.com Category:1908 establishments in England Category:Football in England",
