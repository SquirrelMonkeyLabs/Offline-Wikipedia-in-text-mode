 "text": "Archimedes' number is named after the Greek Archimedes. In viscous fluid dynamics, the Archimedes number (Ar) Do not confuse it with Archimedes' constant, Ï€) is used when the motion of fluids is affected by density differences. It is a dimensionless number, the ratio of gravitational forces to viscous forces. The relationship and has the form: :\\mathrm{Ar}=\\frac{g L^3\\rho_\\ell(\\rho-\\rho_\\ell)}{\\mu^2} where: * g is the local external field (for example gravitational acceleration), m/s^2, * \\rho_\\ell is the density of the fluid, kg/m^3, * \\rho is the density of the body, kg/m^3, * \\mu is the dynamic viscosity, kg/ms, * L is the characteristic length of body, m. == References == Category:Fluid mechanics Category:Numbers Category:Archimedes",
