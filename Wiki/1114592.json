 "text": "The Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission (KLWCC), also known as the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal (KLWCT), was started in 2007 by Malaysia's former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. It investigates war crimes independently because Mahathir saw bias in the International Criminal Court. The tribunal is not recognized by the UN, and its decisions are symbolic. In November 2011, the tribunal tried former US President George W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in their absence. It found them guilty of crimes against peace for the Iraq invasion. ==References == Category:History of Malaysia Category:Mahathir Mohamad",
