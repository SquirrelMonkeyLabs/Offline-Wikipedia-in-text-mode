 "text": "The genome of an organism is the whole of its hereditary information encoded in its DNA (or, for some viruses, RNA). This includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA. Professor Hans Winkler coined the term in 1920.Hans Winkler, Professor of Botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany, as a combination of the words gene and chromosome. : An online copy is available here: Winkler's definition, in translation, runs: :\"I propose the expression genome for the haploid chromosome set, which, together with the pertinent protoplasm, specifies the material foundations of the species ....\" Winkler H. 1920. Verbreitung und Ursache der Parthenogenesis im Pflanzen- und Tierreiche. Fischer, Jena.p165 However, no single haploid chromosome set defines even the DNA of a species. Because of the huge variety of alleles carried by a population, every individual is genetically different. Even a diploid individual carries genetic variety. For that reason Dobzhansky preferred \"set of chromosomes\",Dobzhansky T. 1937. Genetics and the origin of species. Columbia N.Y. and the definition now must be broader than Winklers' definition. The genome of a haploid chromosome set is merely a sample of the total genetic variety of a species. The term 'genome' can be applied specifically to mean the complete set of nuclear DNA (the 'nuclear genome') but can also be used of organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the mitochondrial genome or the chloroplast genome. == Genome sizes == Organism Genome size (base pairs) Note Virus, Bacteriophage MS2 3569 First sequenced RNA-genome Virus, SV40 5224 Virus, Phage Φ-X174 5386 First sequenced DNA- genome Virus, Phage λ 5×104 Bacterium, Candidatus Carsonella ruddii 1.6×105 Smallest non-viral genome, Feb 2007 Bacterium, Escherichia coli 4×106 Best- researched bacterium.
