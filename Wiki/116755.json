 "text": "The Dome of the Rock (, transliteration: Masjid Qubbat As-Sakhrah) is one of two buildings used for Islamic prayers in the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem. Al Aqsa is a historic religious site, which many Israelis and Christians Zionists believe is the location of the Temple Mount. It was built from 691 from 692 by Caliph Abd al-Malik. It is built on the spot where the Jewish Temple is believed to have been, and where Muslims believe Muhammad went up to heaven. The rock on which the building stands is believed by Jews, Christians, and Muslims to be one of the holiest places on Earth.
