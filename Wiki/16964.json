 "text": "Morna Anne Murrary (born June 20, 1945) is a Canadian Pop and Country musician. She was born in Nova Scotia. She was a teacher in physical education. “I wasn’t all that young,” as she told later. “I did go to university and I did teach school for a year. I had my feet planted fairly firmly on the ground when it all began.” But also sang and made records. One of her records, \"Snowbird\", became a hit late in 1970. The song was not about Christmas, but was popular during the Christmas season. The record became a perennial through association with the holiday. Murray later had hits with remakes of Beatles (\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You\") and Monkees songs (\"Daydream Believer\"). She also recorded \"Shadows in the Moonlight\" and \"A Little Good News\", which became popular. She publicly retired from a singer in the music industry in 2008 when she had the last concert tour. == Suggested reading == *https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anne-Murray *https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/anne-murray-emc == Notes == == Outer links == *Anne Murray - Official Website Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian pop musicians Category:Canadian pop singers Category:Country musicians Category:Canadian Grammy Award winners Category:People from Nova Scotia",
