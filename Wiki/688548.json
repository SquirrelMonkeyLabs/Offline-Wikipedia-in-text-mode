In the 1970s and the 2000s, he led successful campaigns for the protection of the Lavaux region. In 2007, Lavaux became a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. He has also worked in the conservation of natural sites in France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Slovenia and Hungary. He has also helped endangered species in South America, Canada, Australia, Africa and Europe.
