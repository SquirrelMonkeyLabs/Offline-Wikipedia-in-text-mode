 "text": "The 2023–24 UEFA Europa League is the 53rd season of Europe's secondary club football competition organized by UEFA. It's the 15th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. The final match will take place at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. The team that wins this tournament will automatically get a spot in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League group stage. They will also play against the winners of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League in the 2024 UEFA Super Cup. This is the last season with the current format of 32 teams in the group stage. UEFA has announced a new format for the next edition, and because of this change, no clubs from the Champions League can move to the Europa League group stage, and future winners won't be able to defend their title. As the current champions, Sevilla has already qualified for the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League. == References == Category:UEFA Europa League seasons",
