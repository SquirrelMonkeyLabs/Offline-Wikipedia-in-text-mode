 "text": "A choral concerto is a type of sacred music. It is written for voices without any instruments. This is because the Orthodox Church does not allow musical instruments in their church. It became popular in the Russian Empire in the middle of the seventeenth century. Dmitry Bortniansky and Maxim Berezovsky were important composers of the choral concerto. == References == Category:Musical forms Category:Choral compositions",
