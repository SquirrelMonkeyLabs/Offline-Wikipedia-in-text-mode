 "text": "The assassination of Yitzhak Rabin happened on 4 November 1995 at 21:30. It happened at the end of a rally in support of the Oslo Accords at the Kings of Israel Square in Tel Aviv. The assassin, an Israeli nationalist named Yigal Amir, was against the accords and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's peace plans. ==Attack and death== After the rally, Rabin walked down the Tel Aviv City Hall steps towards his car. As he entered the car, Amir approached the car from the rear and fired two shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Rabin was hit in the abdomen and chest. Amir was immediately tackled by Rabin's bodyguards and police on the scene, and fired a third shot at bodyguard Yoram Rubin during the struggle, lightly wounding him. Amir was arrested on the scene with the murder weapon. He was taken to a police station a few blocks away.Barak T: Ten years have passed, friend . Tel Aviv Newspaper Perry D: Israel and the Quest for Permanence, p. 216. Yoram Rubin tried to get Rabin in the car but Rabin's body was \"limp and heavy\". Another of Rabin's bodyguards, Shai Glaser, helped put Rabin in the backseat of the car. He was taken to Ichilov Hospital at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a short drive away. Rabin, who was bleeding a lot, was conscious and said that he thought he'd been hurt but not too badly before passing out. Some ten minutes after the shooting, the car arrived at Ichilov Hospital. At this time, Rabin was not breathing and had no pulse. After the air was drained from Rabin's chest, his pulse came back. He then had surgery. However his health got worse and his heart stopped. At 23:02, one hour and thirty-two minutes after the shooting, doctors gave up their tries to revive Rabin and pronounced him dead. ==Rabin's funeral== The funeral of Rabin took place on November 6, two days after the assassination, at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, where Rabin was later buried.
