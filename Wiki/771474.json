 "text": "Lamborghini LM002 is a 4x4 that was made by Lamborghini from 1986 to 1993. This was unusual for Lamborghini, since the company was known for making sports cars. The LM002 was not the first off-road vehicle to be made by Lamborghini. Two prototype vehicles, the Cheetah and the LM001, were made before the LM002. However, they were not successful. The LM002 is part of a series of vehicles known as the Lamborghini Militaria. ==Related pages== *Lamborghini Cheetah *Lamborghini LM001 ==References== Category:1980s automobiles Category:1990s automobiles LM002 Category:Sport utility vehicles",
