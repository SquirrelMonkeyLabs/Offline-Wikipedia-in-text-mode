 "text": "A piano concerto is a concerto written for piano and orchestra. ==Characteristics== ===Form=== A classical piano concerto is often in three movements. #A quick opening movement in sonata form including a cadenza (which may be improvised by the soloist). #A slow, free expressive movement #A faster rondo Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but there are many others which do not. Beethoven's fourth piano concerto includes a last- movement cadenza, and many composers have made innovations â€“ for example Liszt's single-movement concerti. == Other websites == *Classical and Romantic Piano Concertos , a list of Classical and Romantic piano concertos, and other music for piano and orchestra from the same period.
