 "text": "An airline is a company that transports people and items using airliners. An airline may have as few as one airplane or a fleet of hundreds. Most airlines offer regular flights between a group of airports. Ocean liners formerly carried many people across oceans, but during the 20th century airliners came to carry more. An airline has many costs to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, booking commissions, advertising, catering, training, aviation insurance and other costs. ==Related pages== * Air travel * List of airlines ==Other websites== *Simple Flying .
