 "text": "Goosebumps is a Canadian-American horror anthology television series based on R. L. Stine's best-selling Goosebumps book series. It ran from October 27, 1995 through November 16, 1998. Goosebumps originally began airing on YTV (in English) and Canal Famille (in French) in Canada and on Fox Kids in the United States. From October 7, 2007 to September 7, 2009, Cartoon Network aired the episodes. From September 6, 2011 until September 1, 2014, The Hub broadcast the series. The opening sequence starts with a man dressed in black carrying his briefcase up a hill. The name engraved on the briefcase reveals the mysterious man to be Goosebumps' author, R. L. Stine. Hour-long specials The Haunted Mask I & II, A Night In Terror Tower, The Werewolf of Fever Swamp, Welcome to Dead House and Night of the Living Dummy III don't use the opening sequence at all but instead have R.L. Stine introducing those episodes and also appearing at the end. ==Other websites== * at Scholastic Press * Category:1995 American television series debuts Category:1998 American television series endings Category:1995 Canadian television series debuts Category:1998 Canadian television series endings Category:Canadian children's television series Category:American horror television series Category:American children's television series Category:English-language television programs",
