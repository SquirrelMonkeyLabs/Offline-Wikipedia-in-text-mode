The district roughly covers the same territory as the two historic districts Ostprignitz and Ruppin. == Coat of arms == The eagle in the top of the coat of arms is for the Counts of Arnstein, who ruled Ruppin in the 13th century. To the left is a fleur-de-lis for the Counts von Plotho, a Wendish family. The mitre to the right is for Wittstock. Bishop Heinrich I made Wittstock the capital of the Havelberg diocese. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter #Kyritz #Neuruppin #Rheinsberg #Wittstock Amt-free municipalities #Fehrbellin #Heiligengrabe #Wusterhausen 1\\.
