The government of Iceland complained about the company trademarking the name of their country, and of \"harass[ing] Icelandic companies and even the Icelandic tourism board\" by pursuing legal action against Icelandic companies which use the name of their country in their trading names. They complained to the European Union Intellectual Property Office. In 2019 the office decided that the company could not register a trademark for the sole use of the word \"Iceland\" within the European Union. ==References== Category:1970 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Supermarkets of the United Kingdom",
