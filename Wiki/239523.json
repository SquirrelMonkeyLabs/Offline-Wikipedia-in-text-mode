 "text": "Adrian Charles Edmondson (24 January 1957) is in English actor and comedian. He is best known for his roles as Vyvyan Basterd in television series The Young Ones and Eddie Hitler in Bottom. Since 2006 Edmondson has worked more on music instead of acting. He made the band The Bad Shepherds and performs and writes for the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. ==Vyvyan Basterd== Played by Adrian Edmondson, Vyvyan is a psychotic punk metal medical student. He has orange- dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead. In the episode \"Interesting\", he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number 666 is visible on the side of his head. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats and other large objects. He never harms Mike, whom he respects, and often addresses as \"Michael\". He despises Rick more than he does Neil - when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode \"Boring\", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but not Rick, whom he refers to as \"a complete bastard.\" Ironically, this antagonistic relationship between Rick and Vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable, as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates. Unlike Neil and Rick, Vyvyan appears to come from a working-class background (something Rick incorrectly believes himself to have). Vyvyan owns a Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group (\"SPG\" for short) whom he is very fond of, although SPG is also frequently subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence, although it is usually provoked, such as when SPG bit Vyvyan in \"Flood\" or plugging in the TV after Vyvyan swallowed it in \"Bomb\". His mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who before \"Boring\" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and has no idea who his father is. Vyvyan occasionally displays feats of superhuman strength (surviving a pickaxe through his head, moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick and even being decapitated and re-attaching his own head) and eats just about anything: televisions, dead rats, caviar and cornflakes with ketchup. In \"Bambi\" Vyvyan displays impressive mathematical talent (working out instantly that he has worn his three pairs of knickers 269 times each since their last wash), yet also that he cannot tell the time, although he was earlier able to point out that it was midnight without any difficulty. In the episode \"Flood\", he develops a potion to transform a person into an axe-wielding homicidal maniac (he claims \"it's basically a cure... for not being an axe-wielding homicidal maniac... the potential market's enormous!\"). He has more friends than the others but apparently \"he doesn't like any of them.\" He frequently causes havoc or damage such as wiring the doorbell to a bomb to \"pep it up a bit\" and adding a small car engine to the vacuum cleaner as previously it \"looked a bit on the tentative side\" - which then proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's (the vacuum also prompted one of the few clashes between Vyvyan and Mike; when Mike admonished Vyv not to use it anymore, Vyv replied by calling him a \"poof\"). Vyvyan is the only member of the group to own a car - a yellow Ford Anglia with red flames painted along the sides, although he is not the only house member who can drive - during Summer Holiday Rick is briefly seen driving the stolen double decker bus. ==Albums== Year Title Band Notes 1987 Bad News Bad News Album by The Comic Strip's spin-off band (Re-released 1989 and 2004) 1988 Bootleg Bad News Live album by Bad News, jokingly titled Bootleg 1991 Cash in Compilation Bad News Compilation album of randomly picked tracks 1995 Stark Adrian Edmondson Audiobook reading of the Ben Elton book 1995 The Cat in the Hat Adrian Edmondson Audiobook reading of the Dr. Seuss book The Cat in the Hat 1995 Green Eggs and Ham Adrian Edmondson Audiobook reading of the Dr. Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham 1995 Fox in Socks Adrian Edmondson Audiobook reading of the Dr. Seuss book Fox in Socks 1995 The Gobler Adrian Edmondson Audiobook of Edmondson reading his book of the same name 1996 The Cat in the Hat and Other Stories Adrian Edmondson Audiobook of Edmondson reading Dr. Seuss' stories (Re-released 2007) 2005 Pirates Adrian Edmondson Audiobook 2007 Pour l'Amour des Chiens The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band Vocals and writing 2009 Yan, Tyan, Tethera, Methera The Bad Shepherds First album by The Bad Shepherds 2010 By Hook or By Crook The Bad Shepherds Second album by The Bad Shepherds ;Non- album songs Year Title Band Notes 1986 \"Living Doll\" Cliff Richard with The Young Ones In character as Vyvian from The Young Ones 1991 \"Last Night\" The Bum Notes Cover of The Mar-Keys track, used in the credits for Bottom 1992 \"This Wheel's on Fire\" Julie Driscoll and Ade Edmondson As the theme song for sitcom Absolutely Fabulous ==Personal life== Edmonson is married to comedian Jennifer Saunders and they have three daughters, Ella, Beattie and Freya.
