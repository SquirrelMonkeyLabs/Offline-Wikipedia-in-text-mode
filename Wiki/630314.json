 "text": "The Treaty of Lausanne was a peace treaty signed in 1923 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after Turkey had won the Greco-Turkish War in (1919-1922). It settled the Turkish border with Greece and other countries. It opened the Turkish Straits to peaceful civilian travel by all countries. Other countries that signed the treaty were Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Japan and Yugoslavia. Greece and Turkey still have disputes, which are often focused on the question over the country that owns islands and rocks, most of which are uninhabited, in the Aegean Sea. In 1987 and 1996, those disputes almost led to military conflict. Category:1920s in Greece Category:1920s in Turkey Category:1923 Category:1920s treaties",
