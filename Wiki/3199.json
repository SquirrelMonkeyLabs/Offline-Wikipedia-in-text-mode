On May 30, 1854, the United States government made a law called the Kansas-Nebraska Act. It made two territories called Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory. In the 1860s, many people moved there to take free land from the government. Nebraska became a state on March 1, 1867. ==Related pages== * Colleges and universities in Nebraska * List of counties in Nebraska ==References== Category:1867 establishments in the United States",
