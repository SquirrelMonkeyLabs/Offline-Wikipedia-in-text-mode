 "text": "Trap music is a subgenre that originated during the 1990s from Reggeaton in Puerto Rico. It is typified by its ominous lyrics and sound that incorporate double or triple-time division hi-hats, heavy kick drums from a Roland TR-808 synthesizer, layered synthesizers, and \"cinematic\" strings. The term \"trap\" initially referred to places where drug deals take place. In recent years it has been incorporated with electronic dance music by artists who have remixed and made trap songs with more Electronic-like aspects, which created the genre Trap EDM. ==References== Category:Hip hop genres Category:Dance music",
