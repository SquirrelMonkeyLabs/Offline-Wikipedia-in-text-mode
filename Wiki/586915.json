 "text": "In mathematics, a fixed-point theorem is a theorem that a mathematical function has a fixed point. At that fixed point, the function's input and output are equal. This concept is not one theorem itself; it is a way to describe many other theorems. == List of fixed-point theorems == * Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem * Banach fixed-point theorem * Borel fixed-point theorem * Browder fixed-point theorem * Brouwer fixed-point theorem * Caristi fixed- point theorem * Diagonal lemma, also called the fixed-point lemma, for making logical sentences that describe themselves. * Fixed-point lemma for normal functions * Fixed-point property * Injective metric space * Kakutani fixed- point theorem * Kleene fixpoint theorem * Knaster–Tarski theorem * Lefschetz fixed-point theorem * Nielsen fixed-point theorem * Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem proves that a function has two fixed points * Ryll-Nardzewski fixed-point theorem * Schauder fixed-point theorem * Topological degree theory * Tychonoff fixed-point theorem Category:Mathematical theorems",
