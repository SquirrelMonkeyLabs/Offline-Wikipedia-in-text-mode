Slot machines are the most popular gambling method in casinos and make up about 70 percent of the US casino's income. == History == The first modern slot machine was invented by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California, in 1894. The following year Fey built the 4-11-44 in his basement. It became very successful at a local saloon, so he soon quit his job, and opened a factory to make more units. In 1898 Fey built the Card Bell, the first three-reel slot machine with automatic cash payouts. The Card Bell had a handle that set the reels in motion when it was pushed down and playing card suitmarks that lined up to form poker hands. His next slot machine, the Liberty Bell, was built in 1899 and used horseshoes and bells as well as playing card suitmarks on the reels. Three bells lined up in a row meant the top payout. Chiefly because of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, only 4 of more than 100 Liberty Bell machines built by Fey survive. The Liberty Bell proved immensely popular among saloon patrons in San Francisco and was quickly copied by Feyâ€™s competitors, such as the Mills Novelty Company of Chicago. == Variants == # Progressive Jackpot Slots # Multiple Pay-Line # Multiplier Slots # Bonus Multiplier Slots # Megaways Slots # Classic Slots # 3D Slots # Video Slots ==References== Category:Gambling Category:Machines",
