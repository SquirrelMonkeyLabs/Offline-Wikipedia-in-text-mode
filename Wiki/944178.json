The works of the first period (before 1905–1906) are close to Spanish modernism. The second period (until 1919–1920) is the time of historical novels, dramas about the Spanish \"depth\" and the Spanish character. The works of the third period include esperpento (\"horror stories\") for the puppet theater, the novel- pamphlet \"Tyrant Banderas\" (1926), a series of novels about the Spanish history of the second half of the 19th century, — farce and grotesque rule. == References == Category:1866 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Spanish novelists",
