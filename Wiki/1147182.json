 "text": "James Campbell Hagerty (May 9, 1909 â€“ April 11, 1981) served as White House Press Secretary under President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961, and he holds the distinction of being the longest-serving press secretary in U.S. history. Known for his professionalism, transparency, and strategic approach to handling the press, Hagerty was a key figure in reshaping the role of the White House Press Secretary, making it more structured and influential.Eleanora W. Schoenebaum, ed., Political Profiles: The Eisenhower Years (1977) 244-245 Before working for Eisenhower, Hagerty had a background in journalism and public relations. He begun his career as a reporter in New York and later became Governor Thomas E. Dewey's press secretary, working on Dewey's presidential campaigns. His experience with Dewey made him highly skilled in media relations, which proved valuable when he joined Eisenhower's administration. Hagerty was instrumental in modernizing press operations and is credited with innovations like introducing live television broadcast of presidential press conferences. This chance allowed the public direct access to the president's words, setting a precedent that helps build transparency between the White House and American people. His calm, disciplined approach to crisis communication was particularly notable during events like the U-2 spy plane incident in 1960. After leaving the White House, Hagerty went on to work with ABC News, where he continued to shape media practices until his retirement. His legacy is one of professionalism and strategic media engagement, and he set standards for the role that many of his successors have sought to emulate. == References == Category:1909 births Category:1981 deaths Category:American journalists",
