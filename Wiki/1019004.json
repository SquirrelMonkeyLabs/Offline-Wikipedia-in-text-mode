 "text": "Gascony (French: Gascogne) was a province of the Kingdom of France that replaced the old Duchy of Gascony. It lasted until the French Revolution. The land is roughly defined, and the difference in land between Guyenne and Gascony is not clear. Gascony was historically Basque, and they spoke a language related to Basque. The name Gascony comes from the same root as the word Basque. From the Middle Ages until today, the Gascon language has been spoken, however it is only a regional variant of the Occitan language. Gascony is the land of d'Artagnan, who inspired Alexandre Dumas's character d'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers, as well as the land of Cyrano de Bergerac, the character of the play by Edmond Rostand. Henry III of Navarre, who later became king of France as Henry IV, lived in Gascony. == References == Category:History of France Category:Basques Category:17th-century establishments in France",
