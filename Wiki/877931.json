He plays as a winger or second striker. He has made 75 appearances for Peru since making his debut in 2011, and has played for the national team at Copa América (finishing third in 2011 and 2015, and second in 2019) and the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Career== Carrillo came from the youth teams of Esther Grande de Bentin and Alianza Lima, where he started at age 18. He was one of the most promising juveniles in Peru. In 2011, he was transferred to Sporting de Lisboa, forming a great offensive duo with Teofilo Gutiérrez. He had good performances in the Lisbon team, generating assists and scoring chances. He won a Portuguese Cup and Super Cup in addition to achieving good campaigns with the green and white team reaching the semifinals of the UEFA Europa League 2011-12 and won a runner-up in the Primeira Liga in 2013. In 2015 André did not want to renew his contract It expired at the end of the season, which the board did not like. Sporting Lisboa president Bruno de Carvallho ignored the fact that 'the snake' is the star of his team and decided to 'freeze' it in September 2015. This consisted of André not playing a single game with his team until he renewed . André and his representative knew that this was going to lower their price; however, they chose to wait until the summer market where they signed a pre-contract with Benfica. In 2016 he signed for Benfica for 5 seasons and had the opportunity to return to the Peruvian team. His debut with the team was in the Cova da Piedade where they would win 5-0 and his first goal converts him against Nacional where they would end up winning 3-1 on the third date of the Portuguese League. Despite not having the desired continuity, he secured his first title after his club beat Vitória Guimarães 5-0. After some friendly matches rumors were made about his going to Watford. After not having continuity, he was loaned to Watford of the Premier League at the request of his ex-DT Marco Silva, who directed him at Sporting Lisbon. His debut was in the draw against Brighton, entering at 47 'for Cathcart. His first goal was against Swansea City making it 1-0 to finish 1-1. Curiously, days before, his coach had asked him to finish more on goal. With the arrival of coach Javi García at Watford, the player did not have much continuity with the team. His position was filled by Hughes or Feminía. On July 16, 2018, his transfer to the Al Hilal club of the Saudi Professional League was confirmed. His assignment lasted for a season for which 4 million euros were paid with a purchase option of 20 million euros. With 10 goals in 57 appearances for Peru since his debut at age 19, Carrillo is the team's fourteenth top scorer, behind only Christian Cueva. He participated in the following continental tournaments: Argentina 2011, Chile 2015, Copa América Centenario, Brazil 2019, Brazil 2021 and finally, the World Cup in Russia 2018. His participation in the Copa América has been auspicious: he obtained 2 bronze medals in the 2011 and 2015 editions; and obtained the fourth place in the 2021 edition of the Copa América. He reached the continental final in Brazil 2019 later, achieving the runner-up and obtaining the silver medal. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National cup League cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Alianza Lima 2009 Descentralizado 1 0 — — — — 1 0 2010 11 0 — — 0 0 — 11 0 2011 9 3 0 0 — 0 0 — 9 3 Total Total 21 3 0 0 — 0 0 — 21 3 Sporting CP 2011–12 Primeira Liga 24 2 6 1 3 0 13 0 — 46 3 2012–13 23 1 0 0 3 0 5 2 — 31 3 2013–14 27 2 1 0 3 0 0 0 — 31 2 2014–15 32 5 6 2 0 0 8 0 — 46 7 2015–16 4 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 7 2 Total Total 110 11 13 3 9 0 28 2 1 1 161 17 Benfica 2016–17 Primeira Liga 20 2 5 1 3 0 3 0 0 0 31 3 Watford (loan) 2017–18 Premier League 28 1 2 1 0 0 — — 30 2 Al Hilal (loan) 2018–19 Saudi Pro League 21 3 2 1 — 2 0 1 0 26 4 Al Hilal 2019–20 27 4 2 0 — 8 3 2 0 44 7 2020–21 29 7 1 0 — 5 1 1 0 37 8 2021–22 22 4 2 1 — 6 1 4 1 28 6 2022–23 30 1 4 0 — 1 0 4 0 37 1 2023–24 — — — — 5 0 5 0 Total Total 129 19 11 2 — 22 5 17 1 179 26 Al-Qadsiah 2023–24 Saudi First Division League 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 Total Total 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 Corinthians 2024 Série A 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 Total Total 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 Career total 313 38 31 7 12 0 54 7 18 2 426 53 ===International=== Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Peru 2011 1 0 2012 7 1 2013 6 0 2014 8 0 2015 9 1 2016 2 0 2017 8 1 2018 13 3 2019 12 0 2020 4 3 2021 13 2 2022 7 0 2023 7 0 2024 3 0 Total 100 11 :Scores and results list Peru's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Carrillo goal.
