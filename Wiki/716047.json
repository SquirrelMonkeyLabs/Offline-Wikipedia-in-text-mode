 "text": "Thomas Clement Douglas (20 October 1904 - 24 February 1986) was a Canadian socialist politician from Saskatchewan. Douglas founded a political party called the CCF representing socialism and the working class. Douglas was elected Premier of Saskatchewan and created universal healthcare for it. Douglas’s health plan was copied by other provinces and spread to all of Canada. Douglas also created a Socialist political party called the New Democratic Party or NDP. Douglas is generally very respected because he created Canada’s universal healthcare system, but recently some people have suggested that he should not be that praised because in the 1930s he was a supporter of eugenics. Douglas died of cancer on 24 February 1986, at the age of 81 in Ottawa. His daughter, Shirley Douglas, was an actress. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Premiers of Saskatchewan Category:Cancer deaths in Canada Category:20th-century Canadian people",
