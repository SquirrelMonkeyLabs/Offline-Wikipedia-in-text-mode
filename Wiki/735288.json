During the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, Čavoglave became well-known because of the band Thompson's song Bojna Čavoglave. The band's leader, Marko Perković, was born there. He built a \"Church of Croatian Martyrs\" in Čavoglave, as a memorial for Croatian Army soldiers and civilians who died during the Croatian War of Independence. There is an annual fund raising concert in honor of Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day in Čavoglave. Thousands of people visit the concert every year. The 2011 Croatian census said that the village had 300 people. 100% of them were Croatian and Roman Catholic. == References == == Other websites == *Sto tisuća ljudi s Thompsonom u Čavoglavama na pučkoj proslavi (FOTOGALERIJA) Category:Villages in Europe Category:Settlements in Croatia",
