 "text": "The Milne big-eyed tree frog (Nyctimystes persimilis) is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it on Mount Dayman and Mount Simpson between 1370 and 1400 meters above sea level. It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean. This frog is about 40 mm long from nose to rear end. When alive, this frog is light brown with green or brown patches or olive gray with dark brown patches. Preserved, dead frogs are dark purple-gray, but the preservative may have made it darker than a living frog. This frog has teeth in its upper jaw. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
