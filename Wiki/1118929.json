 "text": "During a burial at sea, a deceased person's body is put into the ocean, usually by a ship or aircraft, for disposal. This practice has been used for centuries, by naval and maritime organizations, individuals, and private companies. It can be performed for various reasons, including tradition, necessity, or personal request. == Historical background == The tradition of burial at sea dates back to ancient times. Historians have evidence that Greeks, Romans, and Vikings performed burials at sea. These were often seen as a dignified and respectful way to honor deceased sailors and soldiers, particularly when they died far from land. During the Age of Sail, many seafarers were buried at sea because it was not practical to preserve bodies so they could be brought back to land. The British Royal Navy and other maritime forces developed formal procedures for conducting these burials. Before burial, a dead sailor was often draped in a sailcloth and given a religious service. == Modern practices == In modern times, some people still choose to have a burial at sea, particularly if they feel a strong connection to the ocean or naval service. Procedures vary by country and organization. However, most follow specific regulations to ensure environmental safety and respect for the deceased. === United States === In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees the burials by sea. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) gives them this power. The EPA requires a body to be prepared according to specific guidelines. Additionally, the burial must take place at least three nautical miles from shore, and in water at least 600 feet deep. The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard often conduct burials at sea for their personnel, both active duty and veterans. === United Kingdom === In the United Kingdom, burials at sea are regulated by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO). There are designated sites for such burials, including locations off the coast of Portsmouth and Newhaven. The body must be prepared in a way that ensures it will sink quickly and remain on the seabed. == Religious and cultural aspects == Various religious and cultural groups practice burials at sea. In Hinduism, for instance, water burials are sometimes conducted as a part of last rites. Some Christian denominations also have sea burial traditions, which often incorporate prayers and readings from the Bible. == Environmental considerations == Environmental safety is an important part of modern burial at sea practices. Regulations typically require that the body be free of embalming fluids and that only biodegradable materials should be used. These measures help minimize the impact on marine ecosystems. == Notable burials at sea == * Sir Francis Drake, the famous English sea captain, was buried at sea in a lead coffin off the coast of Panama in 1596. * James Cook, the British explorer and navigator, was buried at sea in Kealakekua Bay after being killed in Hawaii in 1779. * Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, which committed the September 11 attacks, was buried at sea by the United States Navy in 2011. Their goal was to avoid his grave becoming a shrine. == Legal and ethical issues == Burial at sea raises several issues in law and ethics. They often require permission from the relevant authorities. The burial practice has to comply with both domestic and international laws. There have been ethical debates weighing the environmental impact of burials at sea against respect for the deceased and their families' wishes. Category:Burials",
