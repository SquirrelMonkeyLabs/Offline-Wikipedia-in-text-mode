 "text": "Herzegovina is the Southern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has never had defined borders and it has never been an independent state. What later became known as Herzegovina was divided between Croatia, Zachlumia and Travunia in the Early Middle Ages. The Ottomans were the first to begin officially using the name Herzegovina (Hersek) for the region. It means \"Herzog's land\". After the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Herzegovina and Bosnia, were occupied by Austria- Hungary. In 1918, Herzegovina became a part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes which was later renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The largest city is Mostar, in the center of the region. ==References== Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina",
