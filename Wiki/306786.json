 "text": "The Founding Fathers refers to certain men who lived during the American Revolutionary War era. These men signed the Declaration of Independence, either helped write the Constitution of the United States, or helped win the American Revolutionary War. Many of these men were members of the Continental Congress at some point. The term \"Founding Fathers\" was first used for these people in 1916. There were many people who were Founding Fathers. Some scholars like to limit them to a small number, such as seven: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. Most of the Founding Fathers were large landowners or rich merchants. Most of them owned slaves. After the Constitution, many of the Founding Fathers became leaders in the federal government. Five of them, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and James Monroe, were later elected president of the United States. ==List of Founding Fathers== Name Province/state DI (1776) AC (1777) USC (1787) Connecticut Massachusetts Massachusetts Virginia Georgia Virginia New Hampshire Delaware Delaware Virginia North Carolina Virginia New Jersey Delaware South Carolina Maryland Maryland Maryland New Jersey Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Rhode Island Massachusetts New Jersey Delaware South Carolina New York New York Rhode Island Georgia Pennsylvania New York Pennsylvania Massachusetts New Hampshire Massachusetts Georgia Georgia New York Massachusetts Maryland North Carolina Virginia New Jersey Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Massachusetts North Carolina Rhode Island New Jersey Connecticut Connecticut South Carolina Pennsylvania South Carolina Virginia Maryland Connecticut Massachusetts New Hampshire Georgia South Carolina Virginia Virginia New York New York New Jersey Massachusetts South Carolina Virginia Rhode Island South Carolina Maryland Delaware South Carolina Pennsylvania New York Pennsylvania New York Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Virginia Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey North Carolina South Carolina South Carolina Delaware Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Delaware Pennsylvania Pennsylvania South Carolina South Carolina New Jersey Connecticut Pennsylvania Pennsylvania North Carolina New Jersey Maryland Pennsylvania Georgia New Hampshire Delaware Georgia Georgia Virginia New Hampshire New Hampshire North Carolina Connecticut North Carolina Pennsylvania New Jersey Connecticut Virginia === Other delegates === The 55 delegates who attended the Constitutional Convention are referred to as framers.
