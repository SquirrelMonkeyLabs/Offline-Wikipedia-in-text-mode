 "text": "A general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) is a machine gun which gets its ammunition from a belt. It can be used in many different roles: it can support infantry from a bipod or tripod or be put onto a helicopter or armoured vehicle. It can provide fire support for vehicles or infantry from a variety of mounts. A general-purpose machine gun is generally a medium machine gun. It also fires rifle cartridges like the 7.62Ã—51mm NATO or 7.92x57mm Mauser. It is usually used from a bipod, tripod or on a vehicle. This is because it is usually too powerful and heavy to be fired well on foot or while moving. == Examples == Some examples of general-purpose machine guns are: *German Maschinengewehr 34. *German Maschinengewehr 42. * American M60. == Gallery == File:Australian Army soldier in Afghanistan during 2010.jpg|A general-purpose machine gun in Australian service.
