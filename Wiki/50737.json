 "text": "Tentacle rape or shokushu goukan (触手強姦) is illustrated pornography involving the rape of (often quite young) women. This animation is different from other animation methods due to use of tentacles to portray the rape. This was done to get around Japanese censorship laws that made it illegal to portray uncensored male genitalia being used for sexual penetration. Since tentacles are technically not genitals, they do not need to be censored. Not all examples of tentacle erotica are non-consensual, though. In fact, one of the earliest and most famous tentacle erotica works, a Shunga print by Hokusai called The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife, shows a woman enjoying sex with two octopuses.
