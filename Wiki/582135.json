Lacking the support she needed from her family, by age 10, her grandmother disapproved and put her out on the street. Rivera became a child sex worker in Times Square. Later on in her life, Rivera took an interest in human rights, specifically race and gender/sexual orientation. She created the organization STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) with her best friend, Marsha P. Johnson. But not too long after, Johnson was found dead, floating in the Hudson River. Rivera was devastated, and she even attempted suicide once. In the end, she died of liver cancer in 2002. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American civil rights activists Category:American LGBT rights activists Category:Cancer deaths in New York City Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Drag queens Category:Gay men Category:LGBT people from New York City",
