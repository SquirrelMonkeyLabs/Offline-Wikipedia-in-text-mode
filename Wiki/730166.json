Gerardo grew up healthy, but died of bone disease in 1979, aged 40. Medina was raped but never publicly revealed the father of her first-born child. She was less than five years old when she became pregnant. She is also believed to be the youngest documented case of precocious puberty, which is when puberty happens at a very early age.
