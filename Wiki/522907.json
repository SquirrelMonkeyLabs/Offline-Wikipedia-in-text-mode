 "text": "In orbital mechanics, a Hohmann transfer orbit moves a spacecraft between orbiting heights. It is the most fuel-efficient method to do so, because the spacecraft is not trying to escape the planet's gravity, using an elliptical orbit for the transfer. A ship using this would have to apply two velocities, one to enter the elliptical orbit, and one to enter the second orbit. == Calculation == Assuming the mass of the spacecraft is much lower than that of the orbiting planet, the two velocities, \\Delta v_1 and \\Delta v_2, can be solved for as:\\Delta v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{M G}{r_1}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 r_2}{r_1+r_2}} - 1 \\right),\\Delta v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{M G}{r_2}} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2 r_1}{r_1+r_2}}\\,\\,\\right), where * M is the mass of the planet, * G is the universal gravitational constant, and * r_1 and r_2 are the initial and final distances from the center of the planet. == Applications == * Satellites can be moved into their proper height using a Hohmann transfer orbit. * A lunar transfer orbit (LTO) is used to reach the moon. * The Interplanetary Transport Network uses more than one body and requires lower velocity changes, and thus less fuel.
