The house fell into disrepair and was demolished in 2016. == First house == Sunninghill Park was originally part of Windsor Forest until 1630, when King Charles I granted it to Thomas Carey. The first significant house was built on the estate in the late Georgian period in the early 19th century, being a stucco building of two stories with later additions. It served as the headquarters of the American Ninth Air Force from November 1943 to September 1944. The Crown Estate Commissioners purchased the property from Philip Hill in 1945. The main house was to be occupied by Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and her future husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, after their wedding in November 1947. However, the house burned down on 30 August 1947 before their wedding, so they rented Windlesham Moor instead.

In July 2009, Bracknell Forest Borough Council were said to be considering seizing the property under the Housing Act 2004 and using it as a homeless shelter, following several reported break-ins. In 2013 the owner was granted planning permission to demolish it and replace it with a larger house, and in 2014, photos showed the former royal home appeared to be seriously dilapidated.
