 "text": "Fight for the Fallen (2020) was a professional wrestling show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on July 15, 2020 at the Daily's Place in Jacksonville, Florida. The event aired for free as a special episode of Dynamite. It was the second Fight for the Fallen event held by AEW. Like all Fight for the Fallen events, the show was for charity. The money raised was used to help relief efforts for COVID-19. The money raised would be added onto the already $1 million that was donated by AEW owners Tony Khan and his father Shahid. AEW also released a limited-edition shirt for the event for fans at home to buy through their ShopAEW.com website. 100% of the profit went to Florida's First Coast Relief Fund and Feeding Northeast Florida. The main event saw Jon Moxley defeat Brian Cage to retain his AEW World Championship. Moxley won the match after Cage's manager Taz threw in the towel and ended the match. The match was originally supposed to take place on the Night 2 of Fyter Fest. It was rescheduled for Fight for the Fallen because Moxley's wife Renee Young had contracted COVID-19 and he was forced to quarantine. ==Matches== No. Matches Stipulations Times 1 Cody (c) (with Arn Anderson) defeated Sonny Kiss Singles match for the AEW TNT Championship 10:45 2 FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) defeated The Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Rey Fénix) Tag team match 13:25 3 The Elite (Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson) defeated Jurassic Express (Jungle Boy, Luchasaurus, and Marko Stunt) Six-man tag team match 15:05 4 The Nightmare Sisters (Allie and Brandi Rhodes) (with Dustin Rhodes) defeated Kenzie Paige and MJ Jenkins Tag team match 2:00 5 Jon Moxley (c) defeated Brian Cage (with Taz) by technical submission Singles match for the AEW World Championship 15:00 (c) – is the champion(s) going into the match ==References== Category:AEW Fight for the Fallen Category:2020s in Jacksonville, Florida Category:2020 in sports in Florida",
