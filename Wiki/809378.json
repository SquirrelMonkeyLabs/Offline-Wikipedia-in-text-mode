 "text": "In the sport of cricket, net run rate (NRR) is a statistical method used to rank teams in limited overs tournaments. It is especially useful as a tie- breaker when teams have equal points. A team's NRR in a competition is the difference between the average number of runs per over that they have scored, and the average runs per over that have been scored against them. So, if a team has itself scored 9.99 runs per over, and conceded 6.66 runs per over, its NRR is +3.33. == References == Category:Cricket statistics Category:Sports words",
