 "text": "F-flat major is a major scale based on F-flat. Its key signature has six flats and one double flat. Its relative minor is D-flat minor, and its parallel minor is F-flat minor, usually replaced by E minor. Part of Richard Strauss' Metamorphosen uses F flat major, which one commentator has called \"a bitter enharmonic parody\" of the earlier manifestations of E major in the piece. To make reading and writing music easier, F-flat major is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of E major. ==References== ==Scales and keys== Category:Musical keys Category:Major scales",
