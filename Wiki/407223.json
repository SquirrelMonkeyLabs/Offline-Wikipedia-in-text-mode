 "text": "The Massacre at Paris is a play by Christopher Marlowe. It is thought to be his last play, and probably written about 1593. Massacre is about the slaughter of Protestants on Saint Bartholomew's Day in Paris in 1572. The text is significantly flawed, and is likely an actor's recollection of the play rather than the text as Marlowe actually wrote it. What is left of the play is violent and full of jokes about stabbing and murder. As it stands, the play is impossible to perform without extensive alterations. ==References== * Mendel, Jolene. 2008.
