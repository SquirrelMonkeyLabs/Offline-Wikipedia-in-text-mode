 "text": "During the German occupation of Albania (1943-1944), Nazi Germany controlled Albania. This was during World War II. After Italy collapsed, Germany took control of the former Italian Protectorate of Albania, and turned it into a client state known as the Albanian Kingdom. It included Albania itself; parts of modern-day North Macedonia and Montenegro; most of Kosovo; and a few towns in Serbia. The Albanian Kingdom was liberated by the Allies in 1944. After the war, most of its land became the Democratic Government of Albania, but the regions outside of Albania were given to Yugoslavia. == Related pages == * World War II * Nazi Germany * Albania * Military occupation ==References== Category:World War II Category:20th century in Albania",
