 "text": "The Byzantine Empire was ruled by people from the Angelos dynasty from 1185 to 1204 AD. The Angelos family went into power after Andronikos I Komnenos was deposed. The Angeloi were not able to stop invasions from the Turks by the Sultanate of Rum. They were also not able to stop the uprising and creation of the Bulgarian Empire. They also lost the Dalmatian coast and many areas in the Balkans to Manuel I Komnenos in the Kingdom of Hungary. There was lots of infighting in the elite people in the empire. This made the empire lose lots of stability and military power. The Byzantine Empire was also not liked at the time. This was because of a massacre of Latins in the earlier dynasty. The Empire was very leak. This lead to the splitting of the Byzantine Empire. This was in 1204, when soldiers from Fourth Crusade overthrew the Emperor, Alexios V Doukas. ==Related pages== * Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty ==Sources== * Philip Sherrard, Great Ages of Man Byzantium, Time-Life Books, 1975. * Madden, Thomas F.
