 "text": "Ann Matthews Martin (born August 12, 1955) is an American children's writer. Ann Martin grew up in Princeton, New Jersey with her parents and her younger sister, Jane. She graduated from Smith College. After this, Martin became a teacher and then an editor of children's books. Now, she is a full-time writer. Martin finds the ideas for her books from many different things. Some are based on what she has done herself. Others are based on childhood memories and feelings. All of the characters that Ann uses in her books, including the members of The Baby-Sitters Club, are fictional. However, many of her characters are based on real people. Sometimes Ann names her characters after people she knows, and other times she simply chooses names that she likes. In 1990, she started the Ann M. Martin Foundation. This gives money to causes which help children, education/literacy programs, homeless people and animals. ==Books== * The Baby-sitters Club series * Baby-Sitters Little Sister series * The Kids in Ms. Colman's Class series * California Diaries series * P.S.
