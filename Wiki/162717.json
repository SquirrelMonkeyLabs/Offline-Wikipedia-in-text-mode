 "text": "Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic hurricane in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It came close to Bermuda, but did not land there. Nate was the 14th named storm and 7th hurricane of the 2005 season. It started southwest of Bermuda on September 5. It then moved northeast very slowly. It passed south of Bermuda and moved into colder waters. Then, it began to weaken. Nate later became part of a larger weather system. The storm caused no damage because it stayed at sea. However, one person was killed from rip currents that were caused by the storm. Nate caused light rainfall and gusty winds on Bermuda. Canadian Navy ships that were carrying supplies to help people after Hurricane Katrina were slowed down because of Nate.
