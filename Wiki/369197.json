 "text": "Abū Hamīd bin Abū Bakr Ibrāhīm, better known by his pen-name Farīd-ud-dīn Attār (i.e. 'Farid-ud-din the perfumer'), was a Persian poet, Sufi and Muslim theoretician. Little is known about his life and he was probably born in Nishapur, Persia, sometime in the 1140s. He died in 1220 AD. His most famous works are his long allegorical poem, Mantiq at -Tayr (The Conference of Birds) and his account of the lives of many Sufi saints, the Tazkirat el Auliya, but there is no actual and official proof that it was his book. There is a dispute among religious scholars that this books js just attributed to him.
