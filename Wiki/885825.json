 "text": "The Cerro Pelón tree frog (Sarcohyla calvicollina) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have only seen it in two pages: 2519 and 2712 meters above sea level on Cerro Pelón in Oaxaca. Scientists saw this frog in streams with rocky bottoms in cloud forests. Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. They think the frogs might all be dead already because no scientist has seen one since 1980. Scientists are not sure how the frogs died, but they do know that the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which can kill frogs and other amphibians, came to the place where the frog lived. Other frogs that live in streams have also caught the disease chytridiomycosis. Human beings have also cut down the forests where the frogs live to make farms and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
