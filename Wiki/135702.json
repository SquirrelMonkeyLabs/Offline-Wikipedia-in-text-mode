 "text": "\"Hot N Cold\" is a single by pop singer Katy Perry. The song is from the album One of the Boys. The single was released on September 30, 2008. The song reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Belgium (Wallonia). It climbed to the top three in the US and the top five in the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. == Background == \"Hot n Cold\" was written by Katy Perry, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin, and produced by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. It was recorded in December 2007 at studios in New York City and Hollywood, and mixed in Virginia Beach. Capitol Records set up Perry’s collaboration with Dr. Luke because they wanted more hit songs for her album One of the Boys. Together, they wrote both \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold.\" At first, \"Hot n Cold\" was considered as the album's lead single, but they chose \"I Kissed a Girl\" instead. == Music video == The video starts with Katy Perry at a wedding, about to marry her shy fiancé Alexander. She says her vows, but Alexander hesitates, making everyone nervous. Frustrated, Perry starts singing as the guests dance. Alexander runs away, and Perry chases him in a playful cat-and-mouse game. She finds him in a warehouse, where he's forced to crowd-surf while Perry performs. He escapes, only to be surrounded by Perry and a group of brides with baseball bats. As he runs, he sees Perry everywhere—even on his phone. Finally, he's trapped by Perry, her dancers, and the brides. Just as things get intense, he blinks and finds himself back at the altar, realizing it was all a daydream. This time, he says \"I do,\" and the crowd cheers as Perry happily runs down the aisle with him. Perry's friends and parents appear in the video, which was filmed in Los Angeles in September 2008 and released on October 1, 2008. Directed by Alan Ferguson, it was praised for being fun and colorful and has over 1 billion views on YouTube as of November 2020. == Reception == Alex Fletcher from Digital Spy gave the song 3 out of 5 stars, saying it doesn’t quite live up to the hype but has some charm. Darren Harvey from musicOMH called it an '80s-style pop song, while ChartAttack described it as energetic dance-pop. On the other hand, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized it for sounding mildly sexist. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said it lacks the passion of similar songs, and Lizzie Ennever from the BBC felt it wasn’t the best choice for a single. The Guardian noted it didn’t capture public attention like \"I Kissed a Girl.\" Despite mixed reviews, the song was nominated for a Grammy but lost to Beyoncé’s \"Halo.\" == Usage in media == Katy Perry filmed a version of the song with Elmo from Sesame Street to teach kids about opposites. It was supposed to air on December 31, 2010, but the video caused controversy because of Perry’s revealing outfit. Before it aired, Sesame Street decided to cancel the segment, saying it wouldn’t be shown on TV but could still be watched on YouTube. Later, Perry joked about the situation on Saturday Night Live by wearing a low-cut Elmo-themed shirt during a skit. == Track listing == CD Single # \"Hot n Cold\" (Album Version) – 3:40 # \"Hot n Cold\" (Instrumental) – 3:40 # \"Hot n Cold\" (A Cappella) – 3:34 # \"Hot n Cold\" (Rock Mix) – 3:41 # \"Hot n Cold\" (Innerpartysystem Remix) – 4:40 # \"Hot n Cold\" (Bimbo Jones Radio Edit) – 3:50 # \"Hot n Cold\" (Manhattan Clique Radio Edit) – 3:54 # \"Hot n Cold\" (Jason Nevins Radio Edit) – 3:57 == Remixes == Almighty Mixes * \"Hot n Cold\" (Almighty 12\" Anthem Mix) – 8:00 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Almighty 12\" Anthem Instrumental) – 8:00 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Almighty 12\" Anthem Dub) – 7:14 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Almighty Anthem Radio Edit) – 4:01 Bimbo Jones Mixes * \"Hot n Cold\" (Bimbo Jones Club Mix) – 8:02 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Bimbo Jones Instrumental) – 8:10 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Bimbo Jones Radio Edit) – 3:50 ;Manhattan Clique Mixes * \"Hot n Cold\" (Manhattan Clique Extended Club Mix) – 4:40 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Manhattan Clique Radio Edit) – 3:54 Jason Nevins Mixes * \"Hot n Cold\" (Jason Nevins Club Mix) – 7:21 * \"Hot n Cold\" (Jason Nevins Radio Edit) – 3:57 ;Dr. Luke Mix * \"Hot n Cold\" (Rock Mix) – 3:41 ;Innerpartysystem Mix * \"Hot n Cold\" (Innerpartysystem Remix) – 4:40 ;Marsheaux Mix * \"Hot n Cold\" (Marsheaux Remix) – 4:23 Yelle Mix * \"Hot n Cold\" (Yelle Remix) – 4:07 == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from One of the Boys album liner notes. * Katy Perry – vocals, songwriter * Dr. Luke – producer, songwriter, programmer, bass, drums, guitar * Max Martin – songwriter, guitars * Benny Blanco – producer, programmer, drums * Steven Wolf – programming * Şerban Ghenea – mixing * John Hanes – mix engineer * Emily Wright – engineer * Sam Holland – engineer * Nick Banns – engineer * Tatiana Gottwald – engineer * Tina Kennedy – engineer == Chart performance == \"Hot n Cold\" debuted at number 88 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on July 5, 2008, thanks to strong digital sales, but dropped off the next week.
