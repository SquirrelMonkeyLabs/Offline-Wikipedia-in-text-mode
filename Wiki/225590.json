 "text": "Come Away with Me is the first album by American jazz singer Norah Jones. It was released on February 26, 2002 on Blue Note Records. The main genre is considered contemporary jazz. The album is actually contemporary jazz with some country, folk music, and pop. Some jazz musicians do not think that the album is actually jazz, because of the changes Norah Jones made to some of the jazz songs she covered. Come Away with Me reached number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and won eight Grammy Awards. It sold over 10 million copies in the first three years of its release. It is Norah Jones' best-selling album, and the best-selling jazz album of all time. ==Track listing== ==Awards== Grammy Awards Year Winner Category 2003 Come Away with Me Album of the Year Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical Producer of the Year, Non-Classical Best Pop Vocal Album \"Don't Know Why\" Best Female Pop Vocal Performance Record of the Year Song of the Year Norah Jones Best New Artist ==Other websites== * Come Away with Me at Discogs * Come Away with Me at Metacritic * Album Review at All About Jazz Category:2002 albums Category:Debut albums Category:Jazz albums Category:Grammy Award-winning albums",
