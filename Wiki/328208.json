 "text": "Livius Andronicus (died between 207 and 200 BC) was a Greek author who is seen as the first Ancient Roman poet. He was probably an actor, and grew up in the Greek city Tarentum. Scholars think he was captured as a prisoner of war and taken to Rome as a slave. He was later freed, so they called him a freedman. His first language was Greek and scholars think he learned Latin after coming to Rome. His most famous work is the Odusia, a translation of the Odyssey into Latin. ==References== Category:280s BC births Category:200s BC deaths Category:Ancient Greek poets",
