The country banned abortions even if there are cases of severe disability or incurable and life-threatening disease of the unborn child. Mass protests began shortly after the rulings the afternoon of the same day. It is the biggest protest in the country since the fall of communism in 1989. ==References== Category:2020s in Poland Category:2020 in Europe Category:October 2020 events Category:November 2020 events",
