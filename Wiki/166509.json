 "text": "The Mummy is a 1999 American fantasy adventure horror movie. It is set in Egypt in 1926. Stephen Sommers wrote and directed it. The movie stars Brendan Fraser (acting as Rick O'Connell, who is a person who tries to find treasure so he can sell it), and Rachel Weisz (acting as Evelyn 'Evie' Carnahan, who is a person who learns about the history of Egypt) and Arnold Vosloo, acting as the Mummy. The movie has a lot of talking in the old Egyptian language, which was spoken with the help of a group of people who study it for a job. The movie was first going to be to be part of a few low-budget movies but was later given the money it needed to be made into a big Hollywood movie. The Mummy was seen by people for the first time on May 7, 1999. It earned $43 million from being seen in 3,210 places that weekend. It went on to earn $415 million from being seen in total. Other movies were then made. The first was made in 2001. It is called The Mummy Returns. A TV programme was made called The Mummy: The Animated Series. A third movie was then first seen by people on August 1, 2008 and is called The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. == Cast == * Brendan Fraser as Richard \"Rick\" O'Connell * Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan * John Hannah as Jonathan Carnahan * Arnold Vosloo as High Priest Imhotep * Kevin J.
