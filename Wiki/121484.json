 "text": "A traffic collision, also known as a motor vehicle collision or car crash, is when a vehicle hits another vehicle, person or object. Pedestrians, animals, road debris or other objects may be involved. Sometimes a trial occurs, in order to determine fault in a traffic collision. Traffic collisions often result in injury, death, and property damage. They injure tens of millions of people every year, and kill usually a little more than a million. Road safety is partly a matter of design. Ideally, roads should be designed for the safety of all road users. This would mean providing adequate facilities for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Infrastructure measures such as footpaths, cycling lanes, safe crossing points, and other traffic calming measures can help reduce the risk of injury. ==References== ==Other websites== *US car deaths Category:Vehicles Category:Accidents",
