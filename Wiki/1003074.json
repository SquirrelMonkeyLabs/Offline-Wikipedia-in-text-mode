 "text": "Moira Deeming is an Australian politician. She serves on the Legislative Council (upper house) for the Australian state of Victoria with the Liberal Party. Deeming was removed from the Liberal Party for nine months because she spoke at an anti-transgender rally. The National Socialist Network also attended the meeting on their own and were seen giving the Nazi salute. Deeming said that she does not like Nazis so she was suspended for 9 months instead of being removed. On 4 May 2023, Deeming said that she would sue Victorian Liberal Party leader John Pesutto if he does not say that she is not a Nazi. On 12 May 2023, the party voted 19 to 11 to remove her. She is of MƒÅori descent and is a Presbyterian. She has four children. == References == Category:Australian politicians Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people)",
