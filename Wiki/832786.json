 "text": "The Shire Hall in Agincourt Square, Monmouth, Wales, is a well-known Grade I listed building in the middle of Monmouth. It was built in 1724, and was previously the place for the Assize Courts and Quarter Sessions for Monmouthshire. In about 1839/40, the court was the place of the trial of the Chartist leader John Frost and other people for high treason for their part in the Newport Rising. The building was also then used as a market place. Owned by the Monmouthshire County Council, it is currently used as a Tourist Information Centre and as the offices for Monmouth Town Council, and is open to the public in part. Currently, it has been used as a place for a Doctor Who Christmas special and in The Interactives graphic novel. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Monmouthshire Category:Government buildings",
