 "text": "NGC 4526 is a lenticular galaxy in the Virgo constellation. In a telescope, it looks like a lentil-shaped structure with spiral arms. It is one of the brightest lenticular galaxies. It is thought that a supermassive black hole is in the center of the galaxy. Astronomers say that the supermassive black hole is 450 million times the mass of the Sun. Since astronomers found this galaxy, two supernovas have occurred around it. The most recent was SN 1994D, which was the supernova of a white dwarf that was made of carbon and oxygen. NGC 4526 spins at a speed of 250 kilometers per second (559,234 mph or about 900,000 kph). == References == Category:Lenticular galaxies",
