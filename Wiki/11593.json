 "text": "Africa-Eurasia (also called Afro-Eurasia, Eurafrasia, Afrasia and the Old World) is the world's biggest landmass. Around 85% (approximately 5.5 billion) of the world population lives there. It is split between the two continents of Africa and Eurasia, the latter of which has been historically further subdivided into Asia and Europe. In geopolitics, the mainland of Africa- Eurasia (excluding islands such as the British Isles, Japan, Madagascar, and the Malay Archipelago) has been referred to as World Island. The Old World includes Africa-Eurasia and its surrounding islands: * Africa ** Northern Africa ** Sub-Saharan Africa *** Eastern Africa *** Middle Africa *** Southern Africa *** Western Africa * Eurasia ** Asia *** Central Asia *** Eastern Asia *** Northern Asia *** South-eastern Asia *** Southern Asia *** Western Asia ** Europe *** Eastern Europe *** Northern Europe *** Southern Europe *** Western Europe In geological terms, Africa-Eurasia (or Eurafrasia) may be a supercontinent if Africa collides with Europe. One estimate suggests it will happen in 600,000 years, when the southern tip of Spain reaches Africa. If this happens, the Mediterranean Sea will be isolated from the Atlantic Ocean. Africa is expected to collide with Europe completely in 50 million years, closing the Mediterranean.Africa will collide Europe and Asia, 50 Million years from now == References == Category:Supercontinents",
