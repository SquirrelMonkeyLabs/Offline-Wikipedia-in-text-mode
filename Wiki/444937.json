 "text": "Molar concentration, or molarity, or simply concentration, is a term in chemistry, and its physical chemistry branch. It measures the moles of solute in a given volume of a solution or mixture. In chemistry, the molar concentration, c_i is defined as the amount of a constituent n_i (usually measured in moles â€“ hence the name) divided by the volume of the mixture V: International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Amount concentration, c. Compendium of chemical terminology, internet edition. :c_i = \\frac {n_i}{V} The volume V in the definition c_i = n_i/V refers to the volume of the solution, not the volume of the solvent. One litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because when a substance dissolves in a solvent it causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease. The reciprocal quantity represents the dilution (volume) which can appear in Ostwald's law of dilution. == References == == Other websites == * Molarity -Citizendium Category:Physical chemistry",
