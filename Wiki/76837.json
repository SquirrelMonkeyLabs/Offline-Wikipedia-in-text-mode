 "text": "The visual system is the part of the nervous system which allows organisms to see. It interprets the information from visible light to build a representation of the world surrounding the body. The visual system has the complex task of (re)constructing a three dimensional world from a two dimensional projection of that world. The psychological manifestation of visual information is known as visual perception. ==Introduction== This article mostly describes the visual system of mammals, although other \"higher\" animals have similar visual systems. In this case, the visual system consists of: * The eye, especially the retina * The optic nerve * The optic chiasma * The optic tract * The lateral geniculate nucleus * The optic tectum (superior colliculus) * The optic radiation * The visual cortex * The visual association cortex Different species are able to see different parts of the light spectrum; for example, bees can see into the ultraviolet,J Bellingham, SE Wilkie, AG Morris, JK Bowmaker and DM Hunt (1997), \"Characterisation of the ultraviolet-sensitive opsin gene in the honey bee, Apis mellifera\", European Journal of Biochemistry, Vol 243, 775-781 while pit vipers can accurately target prey with their infrared imaging sensors.
