 "text": "Midnight blue is a very dark shade of blue, like navy blue. While they are both dark shades of blue, midnight blue is not the same as navy blue. This color is darker than navy blue and is generally considered to be the deepest shade of blue, one so dark that it might be mistaken for black. Navy blue is a comparatively lighter hue. Midnight blue projects sophistication and elegance. Its link with formal occasions and royalty means it conveys confidence, power and authority, while its deep hue can also come across as dark and mysterious. According to color psychology, blue is associated with trustworthiness and reliability. Dark shades of blue in particular are linked with authority and intelligence; midnight blue’s deep appearance is particularly likely to make this impression. But because it is very close in appearance to black, midnight blue might also project qualities associated with that color. Black can be used to convey power, strength and formality—but it can also signify mourning and fear. == History of midnight blue == The name “midnight blue” was first used in 1915. It is named for its resemblance to the very dark blue shade of a night sky around the Moon. While the color name is relatively recent, midnight blue skies can be seen in Vincent van Gogh artworks from the 1800s like Starry Night. Crayola named a crayon “midnight blue” in 1958, replacing the shade that had previously been known as “Prussian blue”. == Color codes == * In hex: #191970 == Related pages == * Baby blue * Light pink Category:Shades of blue",
