They introduced three well-known superheroes: Superman (1938), Batman (1939), and Wonder Woman (1941). DC Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies. It is best well-known for making \"superhero\" comic books. Their first comic under the DC banner was published in 1937, and is very famous in the modern art subject Graphics.
