 "text": "A pottage is a thick soup or stew made with cereal and vegetable that is boiled or stewed in usually water or milk. It was usually made with wheat, barley, or oats. This is what poor people ate in many countries in most of 9th to 17th-century Europe. Richer people would add meat. The pot was kept on the fire and more things were added, so it kept changing.How To Be A Tudor: A Dawn-to-Dusk Guide to Everyday Life, Ruth Goodman, Penguin Books, 2016, p. 142. ==References== Category:Foods",
