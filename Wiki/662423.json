 "text": "An apologoi is a Greek term which means a story inside a story. It comes from the word apologos which means \"story\". A famous example of an apologoi is in books 9 to 12 of Homer's epic poem, the Odyssey. In that apologoi Odysseus tells the Phaeacians the story of his travels from Troy to Calypso's island Ogygia.Most, Glenn W. (1989). \"The Structure and Function of Odysseus' Apologoi\".
