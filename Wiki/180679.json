 "text": ":This article is about the percussion instrument. For the rhythm used in music of Cuban origin see clave Claves (Spanish word: second e is sounded) are percussion instruments. They are small wooden sticks made of tropical hardwood. They are used in pairs. They are traditionally heard in Cuban music, e.g. salsa.Giro, Radamés 2007. Diccionario enciclopédico de la música en Cuba. vol 1, p236. In Cuban music they often repeat a special rhythm called clave (pronounce: \"CLAH-ve\"). The usual way of playing claves is to hold one clave lightly between the thumb and the fingertips with the palm of the hand facing upwards, or to cradle the clave in the hand. The other, held with the other hand, hits it. == References == Category:Percussion instruments Category:Cuban music",
