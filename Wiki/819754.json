 "text": "\"Laiching Jagoi\" () (literally, \"Dance of summoning the deity\") is a dance form performed by the maibis (priestesses) with the langthrei (a special leaf of Blumea balsamifera) held between their fingers. This sequence involves a variety of expressive movements where the spirit of the deity is invited to enter each maibi's body. It is an invocatory dance where the maibis stand with their hands in a pose symbolizing women's union. In this dance form, the maibis, after invoking the deities from water, perform leitai nongdai jagoi. This dance form is performed in front of the shrine of the deities. ==Related pages== * Leisem Jagoi ==References== Category:Jagoi",
