 "text": "Nyctixalus is a group of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. People call them Indonesian tree frogs in English. They live in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the Philippines, and southern Vietnam. Nyctixalus frogs are like Theloderma frogs, but they are two different genuses. Scientists call them \"sister taxa.\" Scientists thought Nyctixalus was a subgenus inside Theloderma, but they looked at the frogs more and changed their minds. ==Description== Nyctixalus are medium-sized frogs. The adults frogs are long from nose to rear end. Their bodies and legs have many spiny tubercles, or bumps, on them. The toes of the front feet have only a little webbed skin or no webbed skin at all. None of the frogs have a vocal sac. ==Species== There are three species in the genus: * Nyctixalus margaritifer Boulenger, 1882 * Nyctixalus pictus (Peters, 1871) * Nyctixalus spinosus (Taylor, 1920) ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
