 "text": "Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna of Russia (born Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine; 1 November 1864â€“ 18 July 1918) was the second daughter of Princess Alice of the United Kingdom and Grand Duke Louis IV of Hesse. Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1884, Elisabeth married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, the fifth son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Empress Maria Alexandrovna. As an older sister of Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, the last Russian Empress, Elisabeth was very popular in Russian society for her beauty and charity works helping the poor. After her husband was assassinated by socialist revolutionaries in 1905, Elisabeth forgave Sergei's murderer. Afterwards, she left the Romanov imperial dynasty and became a nun. In 1918, she was arrested and murdered by Bolsheviks. In 1981, she was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate. == References == Category:1864 births Category:1918 deaths Category:German princes and princesses Category:Russian princes and princesses Category:House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov Category:Russian nobility Category:German nobility",
