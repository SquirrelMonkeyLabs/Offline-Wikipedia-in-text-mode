 "text": "Filippo Reef is a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean. It is located at , east of Starbuck Island in the Line Islands. The reef was reported by the master of the Italian barque Filippo who saw it on 28 June 1886. From an unidentified report of breakers dated 1926, it was estimated to have a water depth of only , and appeared to be about long northwest to southeast, and less in width. The only sighting referenced shows a date of 1926. The topographic data supplied by the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO), however, shows a sea depth of .General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) It is therefore likely that this 1926 report is an error, and that Filippo Reef is a phantom island.

Nevertheless, it is marked in the 2005 edition of the National Geographic Atlas of the World. ==References== Category:Phantom islands",
