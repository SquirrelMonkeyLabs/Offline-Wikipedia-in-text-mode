 "text": "Fortune-telling is the practice of predicting information about a person's life. It is in principle identical with the practice of divination. The difference is that divination is the term used for predictions considered part of a religious ritual, invoking deities or spirits, while the term fortune- telling implies a less serious or informal setting. ==Other websites== 神戸の占い師・占い館 - https://denwauranai-kyokasyo.com/ Category:Divination Category:Superstitions Category:Magic (paranormal)",
