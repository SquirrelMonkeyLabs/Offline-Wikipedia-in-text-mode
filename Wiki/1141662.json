 "text": "The Finca Primavera rocket frog (Leucostethus alacris) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives in the Cordillera Occidental (west mountains) in the Andes Mountains. Scientists saw them about 1400 meters above sea level. Scientists saw it on the ground near streams in forests. They did not see it anywhere that was not a forest. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional Natural Munchique. ==Young== Scientists did not see any female frogs laying eggs or any tadpoles, but they think this frog has young the way other frogs in Leucostethus do: the female frog lays eggs on the ground. After they hatch, the adults carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists are not sure whether this frog is in danger of dying out. But people cut down the forests where it lives to get wood to build with, make places for animals to eat grass, and grow plants against the law. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
