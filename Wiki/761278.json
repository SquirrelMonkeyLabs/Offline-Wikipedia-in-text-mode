 "text": "John David Pawson (25 February 1930 – 21 May 2020) was an English evangelical minister, writer, theologian and Bible. He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He was the pastor of Guildford Baptist Church. In The Normal Christian Birth, Pawson argued that for a person to enter into Christianity, it should involve more than the simple \"Sinner's Prayer\". He also believed that a person who goes to hell, should stay there for eternity. Pawson died on 21 May 2020, aged 90. ==References== ==Other websites== * * David Pawson Teaching Trust, UK – a non-profit making trust designed to protect and promote the teaching for future years.
