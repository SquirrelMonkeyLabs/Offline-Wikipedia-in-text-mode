 "text": "The Field Spaniel is a mid-sized spaniel dog. They were first developed to be show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because they were not as good at hunting as their cousins the English Springer Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels. Later in the 20th century they were bred to have longer legs and became good gun dogs. ==Colour== They are coloured either brown or black and might have white marks on their chest. ==Temper== They can make good family pets and are usually good at being around children. ==Numbers== They are now (2021) thought to be a rare breed but their numbers are starting to grow. ==References== Category:Spaniels Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in England Category:Rare dog breeds",
