 "text": "Revenge of the Nerds is a 1984 comedy film about a group of brainy misfits who get into university in computer science and get revenge against the people by whom they are constantly bullied. The critics didn’t like it but it made a lot of money and got three sequels. All four movies were later released on DVD as “Revenge of the Nerds: The Atomic Wedgie Collection.” An episode of The Simpsons called \"Revenge is a dish best served three times over\" included a parody of Revenge of the Nerds called \"the Revenge of the Geeks\" of which Milhouse Van Houten is the protagonist.
