 "text": "Ruby is the name of a programming language that was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto in Japan. Like other programming languages, such as Python, its structure (the way it works) is very similar to the English language. It has these qualities: * Terse. Short, but still easy to understand. * Dynamic. Easy to change, anytime and anywhere. * Duck typing. If you think you understand it, you probably understand it. Many programmers like it because the creator tried to make it easy and nice to use. Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a web application framework that is implemented using the Ruby language. == Example == An example Hello World program in Ruby: puts \"Hello World!\" An example program in Ruby that asks for your name and then says it: puts \"What's your name?\" name = gets.chomp puts \"Ah hello there, #{name}\" A function in Ruby that joins the 2 strings (or arrays/integers) into one, removes all numbers from it, capitalizes the string and then repeats it 5 times: def somefunction(arg1, arg2) # creates a function with 2 arguments. the args can be called anything arg = arg1 + arg2 # this joins them into 1 string arg = arg.tr(\"1234567890\",\"\") # this replaces all the numbers with a nothing. erases them essentially. arg = arg.capitalize # read that out loud 5.times do # read that out loud too puts arg # prints it on a new line end end somefunction(\"h1e2l6lo7,\",\" W5o6r8l9d!3\") # does the function Output: Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World!
