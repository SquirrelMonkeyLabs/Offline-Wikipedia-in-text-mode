About 850 AD, a Swedish viking named Garðar Svavarsson arrived on the northern coast of Iceland. There he built a settlement and prepared to stay for the winter. When spring arrived, he went away, leaving two slaves behind. They made a farm there. == Climate == == Photos == File:Husavik Harbor 2006.jpg|Húsavík harbor File:Husavik1.jpg|Church of Húsavík File:Husavik whales.JPG|Whales in Skjalfandi near Húsavík File:A street in Húsavík.jpg|A street in Húsavík File:Húsavík - town, harbour and church.jpg|The town, harbour and church == References == == Other websites == * Official tourist information website * Whalewatching in Húsavík *Whalewatching Guide Category:Towns in Iceland Category:850s establishments Category:Establishments in Iceland Category:9th- century establishments in Europe",
