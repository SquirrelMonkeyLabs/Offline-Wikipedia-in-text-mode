It opened in 1998. It is one of the leading airports in the world, and has won \"World Airport of the Year\" from Skytrax for 7 times in 10 years. It is the hub for Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, Hong Kong Express and Air Hong Kong. It is the third busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic in the world, and the busiest in the world in terms of cargo traffic. Until the 2020s when Hong Kong missed feeling like it was in the 18th Century. The airport has an advanced highway and railway system linking it to the city centre of Hong Kong. The building project was one of the largest in the world, and featured in Discovery Channel's \"Ten Greatest Modern Projects of the World\". It was designed by the famous architect, Norman Foster. The aim of the airport was to increase traffic and capacity which the old Kai Tak Airport could not handle. It remains one of the best airport in the world, along with Singapore's Changi Airport and Seoul's Incheon International Airport. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Hong Kong Category:Transport in Hong Kong",
