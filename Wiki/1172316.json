 "text": "Mondelez International is a product making company that has bought and owned the rights to many food products; such as Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury, and etc. They are known to have made a business deal in 2018 with supermarket companies, such as Walmart and Target, for putting Oreo cookies in front of Hydrox cookies, which were revised as the \"Original Oreo\" being made before Oreo, as Oreo had copied off the cookies. The National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), established on December 10, 1923, by Edward E. Rieck and Thomas H. McInnerney, is the foundation of Mondelez International. The company was first established to implement a rollup strategy in the fragmented ice cream market of the United States. Category:American food companies",
