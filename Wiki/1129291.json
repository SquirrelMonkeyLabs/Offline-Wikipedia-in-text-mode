 "text": "The Mittermeier's rocket frog (Hyloxalus mittermeieri) is a frog. It lives in Peru. This frog is awake during the day. Scientists saw them in tropical forests on mountains between 1620 and 2050 meters above sea level. They saw it near streams. Scientists do not know if the tadpoles swim in streams, but they think so. Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out, but they think the fungal disease chytridiomycosismight hurt or kill this frog. It has killed many other frogs in the Andes Mountains that live in streams. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
