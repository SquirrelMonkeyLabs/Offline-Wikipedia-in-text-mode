 "text": "Dewsbury is a market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire. It is on the River Calder. A bit of the Calder and Hebble Navigation waterway goes there. It is to the west of Wakefield, east of Huddersfield and south of Leeds. It was an important centre for wool milling. They collected used woollen items, mixed them with new wool and made heavy blankets and uniforms. Dewsbury Minster is near the River Calder. Some of it was built in the 13th century. The market was set up in the 14th century. In 1770, a short branch of the Calder and Hebble Navigation reached the town. That helped the mills because the boats could get to to Manchester and Hull. The town now has a large Muslim community. == References == Category:Towns in West Yorkshire",
