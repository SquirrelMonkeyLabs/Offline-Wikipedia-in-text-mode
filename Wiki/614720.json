 "text": "Greater Grand Crossing is one of the 77 community areas of Chicago, Illinois. It is located on the city's South Side. The name \"Grand Crossing\" comes from an 1853 right-of-way feud between the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and the Illinois Central Railroad that led to a frog war and a crash that killed 18 people. This led Mayor Roswell B. Mason to illegally construct railroad tracks across another railroad company's tracks. During the 1950s, the Black population of the neighborhood rose from 6% to 86%. Today, the neighborhood is 97% Black. The Red Line of the CTA travels to Greater Grand Crossing. ==References== Category:Community areas of Chicago",
