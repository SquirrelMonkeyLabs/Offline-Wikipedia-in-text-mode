 "text": "Dietrich Hugo Hermann von Choltitz (9 November 1894 – 5 November 1966) was an officer of the German Army in World War II. Choltitz was born in Gräflich Wiese (now Łąka Prudnicka) next to Neustadt (now Prudnik). He participated in occupation of Sudetenland in 1938 and in the invasion of Poland in 1939. On 7 August 1944 he became the military governor of Paris. On 25 August he surrendered Paris to the Allies. He has been called the \"Saviour of Paris\" because he prevented its destruction. Choltitz said he defied Hitler's direct order for its destruction because it was militarily useless. Other reasons were his affection for Parisian history and culture, and his belief that Hitler had become insane. Choltitz died on 5 November 1966 in Baden-Baden. == References == Category:1894 births Category:1966 deaths Category:German generals of World War II Category:German military personnel of World War I",
