 "text": "Archbishop ad personam is a title given by the Pope to certain bishops. It is an honorary title that allows a bishop to be called an archbishop, even if he is not in charge of an archdiocese. Usually, an archbishop is in charge of an archdiocese, which is a larger or more important diocese. Sometimes a bishop who is not in charge of an archdiocese is given the title \"archbishop\" as a special honor. This can happen because of the bishop's work, his role in the Church, or other reasons decided by the Pope. == Related pages == * Auxiliary bishop * Titular bishop * Bishop coadjutor * Bishop-elect == References == Category:Bishops by type Category:Titles Category:Roman Catholic archbishops",
