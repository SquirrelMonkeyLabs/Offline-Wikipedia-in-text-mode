 "text": "An antithesis (plural: '\"antitheses'\") is a figure of speech which contrasts two opposite ideas with similar sentence structures in one statement. This word is derived from the Greek anti, which means opposite, and thesis, which means setting. Antithesis is often used to express contrasting ideas and strengthen arguments by pointing out differences. This makes it more memorable and catchy for readers and listeners alike in literature, advertisements and music. It does the latter by showing that the arguer's own idea is better. When used correctly, it can make writing tense and dramatic, allowing readers to explore complex themes and ideas. == Examples == === Literature === # \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" - Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities # \"I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.\" - Matthew 10:34, The Bible # \"Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven.\" - John Milton, Paradise Lost === Real Life === # \"Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.\" - John F. Kennedy # \"We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.\" - Martin Luther King Jr. == References == Category:Figures of speech",
