 "text": "Tromsø Heliport, University Hospital (Norwegian: ) is a place where helicopters land and take off. It is located at the University Hospital of North Norway in Tromsø. The helicopters at this heliport are only used for emergencies. There is one helicopter stationed here, called an AgustaWestland AW139, which is run by Norwegian Air Ambulance. It has room for three crew members and two stretchers. The heliport was established in 1988, but there were already air ambulance services in Tromsø in 1985. There was some competition between two different companies providing this service, which made things difficult for the hospital. In 1986, the Norwegian government decided to create a national helicopter ambulance service, and Tromsø was chosen as one of the eight bases. The heliport is owned and operated by the University Hospital of North Norway. The helipad is on top of the building used by the helicopter, and there is a walkway to the emergency department of the hospital. The helicopter at Tromsø Heliport is used for many different types of emergencies, including avalanches. It has a camera that can detect heat, which helps with search and rescue missions. In 2019, the helicopter was used 844 times and flew for 675 hours. == References == Category:Tromsø",
