 "text": "Salland is a historical region in the west and north of the present Dutch province of Overijssel. ==History== The history of Salland goes back to the early Middle Ages, when the four quarters of Oversticht (Salland, Twente, Land van Vollenhove and Drenthe) came together. Salland (and nearby areas) may have been the early seat of the Salian Franks, the founders of the modern Dutch and French nations. ==Geography== Salland is bound to the west by the provincial border with Gelderland, which is partly formed by river IJssel; to the north by the Meppelerdiep stream and the provincial border with Drenthe, which partly consists of the Reest stream; to the east by the borders with the German state of Lower Saxony and the eastern Overijssel region of Twente; and to the south by the border with the Gelderland region of Achterhoek, part of which is formed by the Schipbeek stream. Geologically, most of Salland's landscape consists of a lowland covered with river sediment. == Municipalities == These 13 municipalities belong to Salland region: * Dalfsen * Deventer (also part of IJsselvallei region) * Hardenberg * Hellendoorn (small part in Twente region)Hellendoorn, Rijssen-Holten, and Zwartewaterland belong administratively to Twente region. * Kampen (also part of IJsselvallei and Kop van Overijssel regions) * Olst-Wijhe (also part of IJsselvallei region) * Ommen * Raalte * Rijssen-Holten (partially in Twente) * Staphorst (also part of Kop van Overijssel region) * Twenterand (partially in Twente) * Zwartewaterland (also part of Kop van Overijssel region) * Zwolle (also part of IJsselvallei region) == Related pages == * Achterhoek * Kop van Overijssel * Twente == References == * Plaatsengids.nl == Other websites == * Salland Natuurlijk Gastvrij, pages of the Salland Board of Tourism (in Dutch) Category:Regions of the Netherlands",
