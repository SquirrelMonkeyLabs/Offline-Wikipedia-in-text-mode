 "text": "The Gentrification of Chicago is a process that has changed the demographic of some neighborhoods in Chicago usually by lowering the percentage of low-income minority residents and increasing the percentage of white, higher-income residents. Gentrification has been an issue between the residents of minority neighborhoods in Chicago. Many people in Chicago believe that gentrification is pushing poorer and mainly minority people out of their longtime neighborhoods. Factors to measure gentrification in Chicago are changes in the number of residents with bachelor's degrees, median household income, racial makeup, visual looks, and the presence of coffee shops. There have been phases of gentrification in Chicago of various neighborhoods, some of which were in 1990s and in 2007–2009. Gentrification debates in Chicago have been mostly focused around the gentrification of Chicago's historically Latino or black neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are located near the central urban downtown areas and along the east side of the city. Some neighborhoods in the city which has had a large minority population that has been gentrified include: Wicker Park, Humboldt Park, Pilsen, Logan Square, Uptown and the Cabrini–Green Homes in the city's Near North Side. ==Related pages== * Gentrification ==References== Category:History of Chicago Category:Economic geography",
