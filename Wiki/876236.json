 "text": "Gautrain is an express suburban rail network in Gauteng, South Africa, which links Johannesburg, Pretoria, Ekurhuleni, Sandton and O.R. Tambo International Airport. The Gautrain network has 10 stations and a total length of 80 kilometers.Annual Report Gautrain Management Agency It takes 15 minutes to travel from Sandton to O.R. Tambo International Airport and 35 minutes from Pretoria to Johannesburg on the Gautrain. Bus and minibus services are available to transport passengers to and from all stations, but not the O.R. Tambo International Airport Station. The purpose of Gautrain is to provide a faster service for passengers, than the regular and slower Metrorail Gauteng suburban rail which also links most of the same places. Some stations of Gautrain are interchange stations with the Metrorail Gauteng stations. Another purpose of Gautrain is to reduce traffic congestion between Johannesburg and Pretoria and their metropolitan areas. == References == == Other websites == *Official Gautrain Website *Gautrain Environmental Impact Assessment *Official Bombardier Website about Gautrain Category:Rapid transit systems Category:Johannesburg Category:Pretoria Category:Transport in South Africa Category:Organizations based in South Africa",
