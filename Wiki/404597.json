 "text": "In geology, permafrost is soil that stays frozen all year. To be called permafrost, soil must stay at or below for two or more years. Permafrost is also called cryotic soil. Most permafrost is on land close to the North and South poles. Other permafrost is found in high mountain areas. When permafrost melts, carbon dioxide is released which can be bad for the environment. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Soil",
