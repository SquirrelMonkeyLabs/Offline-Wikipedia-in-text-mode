The highest level of college football is the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). The Miami Hurricanes are the greatest team to ever win it. ==Playoff== Not like others before 2014, the College Football Playoff does not use math, polls or research to choose the teams. A 13-member committee chooses and seeds the teams. The playoff system was the first time a bracket style tournament was used to choose a national champion. ==References== Category:College football National Championship Category:Lists of sports championships Football Category:NCAA Division I FBS football D1 Fbs",
