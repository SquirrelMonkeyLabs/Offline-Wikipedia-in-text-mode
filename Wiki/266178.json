 "text": "Osteoarthritis normally affects older people. It is a disease where joints wear out. As the joint surface wears away, it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid. This causes the joint to swell. When the joint cartilage wears away, the core of the bone becomes exposed. The exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone. ==Synovial fluid analysis== ==Management== ===Exercise=== Weight loss and exercise give long-term treatment. Short-term treatments usually have risk of harm (in the long-term). The way to get through the pain is to be active (exercise), not rest. This is similar to the management of back pain, but other conditions require rest. ==Symptoms== Joints will be stiff and painful, and may be swollen. The pain may be worse after exercise. It may get harder to move the joint. ==References== Category:Arthritis Category:Diseases and disorders of joints",
