 "text": "Hypochondriasis (more well known as hypochondria) is mental illness. It in involves excess worries about having an illness. This is often the result from having inaccurate perceptions of the human body or mental health. People with hypochondria are often very worried about their health. In fact there is nothing wrong with them. They become unduly alarmed of even the slightest physical symptom in their very bodies. They can become convinced they are about to become sick, have health problems, or even die. == Source == Category:Anxiety disorders",
