He began his career as a professor at the College of William and Mary. Whitehurst was elected to Congress in 1968 as a Republican from a district based in the Hampton Roads area. He was the first Republican to represent that part of Virginia since the Great Depression, and only the second Republican elected to a full term from that district in the 20th century. On October 6, 2016, Whitehurst, along with other Republican former members of Congress, was co-signator of a letter opposing Donald J. Trump's candidacy for the office of president. ==References== ==Other websites== *Biographical Directory of the United States Congress *Profile , Old Dominion University *Alumni Recognition Award Recipients for 2004 , West Virginia University * Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:Educators from Virginia Category:American television presenters Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:United States representatives from Virginia Category:People from Norfolk, Virginia Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
