 "text": "Anil's bush frog (Raorchestes anili) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists saw it in the Western Ghat mountains between 840 and 1150 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 23.2 - 25.2 mm long from nose to rear end and one female frog was 29.3 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color with darker brown marks. There is a dark brown mark on each side of the body, from each front leg to each back leg, meeting in the middle to make a V shape. There is a light brown mark between the eyes. Most of the snout is gray. There are many brown-black spots on the back. The iris of the eye is yellow-red in color with gray around the outside. Scientists named this frog after their helper, Anil Zachariah. People have seen this frog in forests, in coffee farms, and even very near houses. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that human beings have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
