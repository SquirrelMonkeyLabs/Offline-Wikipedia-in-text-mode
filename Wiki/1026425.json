 "text": "Natalija Obrenović (15 May 1859 – 8 May 1941), née Keshko, known as Natalie of Serbia, was the wife of Milan I of Serbia. Of ethnic Romanian origin, she was the daughter of a Russian Colonel and Moldavian Princess. As the wife of Milan, she was Queen of Serbia until 1889 when King Milan I abdicated the throne in favour of their son, Alexander I, who hadn't reached the age of 18 yet so the Kingdom was governed under a regency. In 1903, King Alexander and his wife were killed by a coup. This left Queen Natalie as the sole surviving member of the Obrenović dynasty. She died in France.
