 "text": "The Knot density is the measurement of the knots present in a specific unit of carpet, It is mostly calculated through KPSI(knots per square inch). The higher knot density also gives idea about the valuation of a carpet as through it anyone can estimate the time and effort went in production. Higher knot density makes the design more finer and clear. The lower knot density isn't means that the carpet is worthless, It is also used in making the carpet thicker and to give a plushy texture. Different country uses differ knot density like Persian carpets typically made in high knot density besides the tribal areas carpet are made in low knot density. Higher knot density enables finer, curvilinear designs and is often associated with greater value and craftsmanship. ==References== Category:Carpets",
