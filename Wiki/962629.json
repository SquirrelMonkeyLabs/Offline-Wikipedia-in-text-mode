It went to number 26 in the United Kingdom and number 38 in the United States. ==Track listing== *On vinyl and cassette releases, \"Me & My Wine\" (Remix) is added to the end of side one, while \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" (Remix) leads off side two. On CD releases, \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak\" (Remix) and \"Me & My Wine\" (Remix) follow \"No No No\". *The last lyric, 'no', in \"No No No\" repeats infinitely on the original vinyl album release. The original cassette features \"no\" being screamed 46 times and then ending abruptly when the cassette finished. On later releases the \"no\"s simply fade out. ==References== Category:1981 albums Category:Def Leppard albums",
