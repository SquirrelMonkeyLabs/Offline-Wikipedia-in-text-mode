 "text": "Clifford the Big Red Dog, also known as simply Clifford, is an American cartoon TV series, based on the book series Clifford the Big Red Dog. The show is about Clifford, the big red dog, who gets into trouble sometimes and has 2 best friends (Cleo and T-Bone); his owner, Emily Elizabeth Howard, loves him very much and takes excellent care of him: in fact that's how he got so big. It aired on PBS Kids in the United States from September 4, 2000 to March 8, 2002. John Ritter voices Clifford in every episode. By the time the series ended production and the subsequent film Clifford's Really Big Movie was completed, Ritter was back on ABC's prime time schedule, starring in 8 Simple Rules. Ritter's death on September 11, 2003, came ten days after the debut of Clifford's Puppy Days (it is often mistakenly cited as the reason the spin-off was created in lieu of a third season). Though the production of Clifford ended before Ritter's death, voice actors for the main characters have reprised some of their roles for the Ready to Learn PBS Kids PSAs. Clifford's Really Big Movie served as the series finale, Clifford's Puppy Days still continued to air until its cancellation in 2006. On May 16, 2018, Scholastic announced a reboot of the series of the same name, which was released on December 6, 2019, on Amazon Prime Video and December 7, 2019, on PBS Kids, starring Adam Sanders as the new voice of Clifford. PBS continued to air reruns of the 2000 series until 2022. Select PBS member stations still continue to carry the show. ==Broadcast== * The series aired on PBS Kids in the United States from September 4, 2000 to March 8, 2002. * In the United Kingdom, it first aired on CBeebies in April 2002, and later has aired on Tiny Pop, but it retains from the United States version. * In the Republic of Ireland, it first aired on TG4 on 6 February 2001. * In Latin America and Brazil, it premiered on Discovery Kids on July 21, 2003. ** In Mexico, it last aired on September 24, 2010.
