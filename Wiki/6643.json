Winter comes after autumn and before spring. ==Overview== Winter begins at the winter solstice. In the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice is usually December 21 or December 22. In the southern hemisphere, the winter solstice is usually June 21 or June 22. Some animals hibernate in this season. In temperate climates there are no leaves on deciduous trees. People wear warm clothing, and eat food that was grown earlier. Many regions have snow in winter. ==Holidays== ===Christmas=== Holidays in winter for many countries include Christmas and New Year's Day. The name comes from an old Germanic word that means the \"time of water\" in reference to the rain and snow of winter in middle and high latitudes. Some nations do not have a time of the year which has temperatures too different than in other seasons. There is no snowing in many regions during winter. ==Related pages== * Spring * Autumn * Summer * Astronomy * Meterology * Greek mythology * Roman mythology Category:Seasons Category:Meteorology Category:Basic English 850 words",
