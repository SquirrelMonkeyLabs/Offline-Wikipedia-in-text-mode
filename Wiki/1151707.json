 "text": "Hội An Ancient Town is located in Quang Nam Province, Vietnam, near the mouth of the Thu Bồn River, and about 30 km south of Da Nang. The town flourished as a major international trading port in the 17th and 18th centuries. Merchants from Japan, China, and Europe gathered here, making it a vibrant hub of commerce. In 1999, Hội An Ancient Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved Southeast Asian trading port architecture and cultural significance. == Early History == === Prehistoric and ancient cultures === Hội An's area was home to the Sa Huynh culture (from 1,000 BCE to 200 CE), known for its burial artifacts and trade links. Later, it became part of the Champa Kingdom (2nd–15th centuries), which built Hindu temples like those at My Son and facilitated maritime trade. === Champa to Đại Việt === After the 15th century, the Dai Viet kingdom took over, integrating the region into Vietnamese culture. === Golden Age of Trade === From the late 16th to 18th centuries, Hội An thrived as a bustling port. The town became famous for its wooden architecture, the Japanese Covered Bridge, and cultural exchange between local and international communities. The name “Hội An” emerged in the late 16th century, possibly derived from its reputation as a peaceful trading area. === Decline and preservation === Hội An's significance waned in the 19th century as Da Nang became the primary port. Fortunately, the town avoided destruction during wars and major modernization efforts, preserving its historical charm. == Tourism and legacy == Today, Hội An is a major tourist destination, celebrated for its traditional houses, street markets, and vibrant festivals. Its architectural blend of Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese styles reflects its multicultural history.
