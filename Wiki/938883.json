 "text": "Angus Buidnech (maybe spelled Aonghas, please check this article if you can read this language) was a legendary king of Dál Riata accounted for by the Senchus fer n-Alban, which says he was the son of Fedelmid mac Senchormac. He may have ruled from around 360 to 405, when he died. He was the great-great- great-grandfather of the royal hero Fergus Mór. Angus probably waged war against Pictish kings Gartnait II (360-387) and Talorc I (387-405), and was said by some to be the first Scot born in Scotland. It is unknown what his epithet, Buidnech, meant, but it is known that Buí is Irish for yellow, maybe referring to this king's hair colour. Angus is remembered by George Buchanan in 1588 with the words \"A good king who was slain by the Picts\". Buchanan also said he succeeded his uncle, not his father, as most traditions say.
