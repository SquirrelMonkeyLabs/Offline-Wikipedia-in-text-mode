 "text": "Mandaluyong, officially the City of Mandaluyong (), is a city in Metro Manila, Philippines. == Early history == Located directly east of Manila, Mandaluyong was originally a barrio of Santa Ana de Sapa (now a district of Manila) called San Felipe Neri. It separated and became its own town in 1841, and later acquired the name Mandaluyong in 1931 during the American occupation of the Philippines. In 1994, it became the first municipality of Metro Manila to become a city since the metropolis' establishment in 1975. Natives of Mandaluyong trace their roots to Emperor Soledan (also known as \"Anka Widyaya\" of the Great Majapahit Empire) and Empress Sasaban of the kingdom of Sapa, whose son Prince Balagtas ruled as sovereign of the kingdom in about the year 1300. In about the year 1470, the kingdom of Sapa expanded and became the \"Kingdom of Namayan\" with \"Lakan Takhan\" as sovereign. The vast kingdom comprised what are now Quiapo, San Miguel, Sta, Mesa, Paco, Pandacan, Malate and Santa Ana in Manila, and Mandaluyong, San Juan, Makati, Pasay, Pateros, Taguig and Parañaque. Mandaluyong's present-day district of Namayan along the banks of Pasig River exists as a remnant of its noble past. ==Barangays== Mandaluyong is politically subdivided into 27 barangays.
