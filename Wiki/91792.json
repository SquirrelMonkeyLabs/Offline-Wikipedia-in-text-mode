 "text": "Chemnitzer Land was a district in the Free State of Saxony, Germany. It ended in 2008. The district has a very big population because the East German government tried to make the area very industrial. The district was created in 1994 by joining the old districts of Glauchau and Hohenstein-Ernstthal. In 2008, part of city of Zwickau will become part of the district. The rest of the city will become part of Zwickauer Land. == Coat of arms == The lion is the heraldic lion of Saxony.
