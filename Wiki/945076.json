 "text": "The UEFA European Under-19 Championship, or simply UEFA Under-19 Championship or the UEFA Euro U-19, is an yearly football competition, challenged by the European men's under-19 national teams of the member associations of UEFA. Spain and England are the most successful team in this competition, having won eleven titles each. England are also the current champions. ==History and format== The competition has been held since 1948. It was originally called the FIFA International Youth Tournament, until it was taken over by UEFA in 1956. In 1980, it was restyled the UEFA European Under-18 Championship. Until the 1997 tournament, players born on or after 1 August the year they turned 19 years were eligible to compete. Since the 1998 tournament, the date limit has been moved back to 1 January. The championship received its current name in 2001, which has been used since the 2002 championship. The contest has been held every year since its founding in 1948, except for the period between 1984 and 1992, when it was only held every other year. The tournament has been played in a number of different formats during its existence. Currently it has two stages, similar to UEFA's other European championship competitions. The qualifying stage is open to all UEFA members, and the final stage is battled between eight teams. During even years, the best finishing teams qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup held in the next (odd) year. Currently, five teams can qualify for the World Cup, having the top two of their groups plus the winner of a play-off match between the third-placed teams of each group. ===Number of teams=== Year of tournament Format of the final round Number of teams 1986–1992 Knockout format 8 1993 Two groups of four teams, third place play- off and final 8 1994 Two groups of four teams, fifth place play-off, third place play-off and final 8 1995–2002 Two groups of four teams, third place play-off and final 8 2003–2015 Two groups of four teams, semi-finals and final 8 2016–present Two groups of four teams, fifth place play-off (in even years only, for qualifying to FIFA U-20 World Cup), semi-finals and final 8 ==Results== ===FIFA Youth Tournament (1948–1954)=== Year Host Final Third place match Winner Score Runner-up Third place Score Fourth place 1948 details 3–2 3–1 1949 details 4–1 5–0 1950 details 3–2 6–0 1951 details 3–2 1–0 1952 details 0–0 goal average 5–5 coin toss 1953 details 2–0 3–2 1954 details 2–2 Spain won on goal average 1–0 ===UEFA Youth Tournament (1955–1980)=== 1957 Details 3–2 🇫🇷 France 0–0 🇮🇹 Italy 1958 Details 1–0 3–0 1959 Details 1–0 6–1 1960 Details 2–1 2–1 1961 Details 4–0 2–1 1962 Details 4–1 1–1 Czechoslovakia won on coin toss 1963 Details 4–0 4–2 1964 Details 4–0 3–2 1965 Details 3–2 4–1 1966 Details 0–0 Title was shared 2–0 1967 Details 1–0 1–1 Turkey won on coin toss''' 1968 Details 2–1 4–2 1969 Details 1–1 Bulgaria won on coin toss 1–0 1970 Details 1–1 coin toss 2–0 1971 Details 3–0 1–1 1972 Details 2–0 0–0 1973 Details 3–2 1–0 1974 Details 1–0 1–0 1975 Details 1–0 2–2 1976 Details 1–0 3–0 1977 Details 2–1 7–2 1978 Details 3–0 3–1 1979 Details 1–0 0–0 1980 Details 2–1 3–0 === UEFA European Under-18 Championship (1981–2001) === 1981 Details 1–0 1–1 1982 Details 3–1 3–1 1983 Details 1–0 1–1 1984 Details 0–0 2–1 1986 Details 3–1 1–0 1988 Details 3–1 2–0 1990 Details 0–0 1–0 1992 Details 2–1 1–1 1993 Details 1–0 2–1 1994 Details 1–1 5–2 1995 Details 4–1 5–0 1996 Details 1–0 3–2 1997 Details 1–0 2–1 1998 Details 1–1 0–0 1999 Details 1–0 1–0 2000 Details 1–0 3–1 2001 Details 3–1 6–2 === UEFA European Under-19 Championship (since 2002) === 2002 Details 1–0 2003 Details 2–0 2004 Details 1–0 2005 Details 3–1 2006 Details 2–1 2007 Details 1–0 2008 Details 3–1 2009 Details 2–0 2010 Details 2–1 2011 Details 3–2 2012 Details 1–0 2013 Details 1–0 2014 Details 1–0 2015 Details 2–0 2016 Details 4–0 2017 Details 2–1 2018 Details 4–3 2019 Details 2–0 2022 Details 3–1 2023 Details 2024 Details 2025 Details 2026 Details ==Statistics== ===Performances by countries=== UEFA European Youth Championship UEFA European Youth Championship UEFA European Youth Championship UEFA European Youth Championship UEFA European Youth Championship UEFA European Youth Championship UEFA European Youth Championship Team Titles Runners-up Third place Fourth place Semi-finalists Total (Top Four) 11 (1948, 1963, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1980, 1993, 2017, 2022) 5 (1958, 1965, 1967, 2005, 2009) 3 3 3 25 11 (1952, 1954, 1995, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019) 4 (1957, 1964, 1996, 2010) 6 6 1 28 8 (1949, 1983, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016) 3 (1950, 1968, 2013) 3 4 7 25 6 (1965, 1970, 1981, 1986, 2008, 2014) 7 (1954, 1969, 1972, 1973, 1994, 1998, 2002) 5 2 2 22 6 (1966*, 1967, 1976, 1978, 1988, 1990) 2 (1984, 2015) 3 1 12 4 (1961, 1994, 1999, 2018) 9 (1971, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1997, 2003, 2014, 2017, 2019) 3 2 2 20 3 (1958, 1966*, 2003) 7 (1959, 1986, 1995, 1999, 2008, 2016, 2018) 3 3 1 17 3 (1951, 1979, 2013) 4 (1953, 1962, 1974, 1978) 1 1 4 13 3 (1959, 1969, 1974) 2 (1977, 1979) 3 8 3 (1953, 1960, 1984) 1 (1976) 2 1 7 2 (1950, 1957) 1 (1951) 1 1 3 8 1 (1968) 4 (1982, 1983, 2001, 2011) 2 1 4 12 1 (2001) 3 (1961, 1980, 1981) 3 1 8 1 (1992) 2 (1993, 2004) 2 3 8 1 (1982) 1 (2006) 3 4 9 1 (1977) 1 (1952) 3 1 6 1 (1962) 1 (1960) 1 3 1 (2009) 1 (2000) 2 4 1 (1998) 1 3 2 7 3 (1948, 1949, 1970) 1 3 1 8 2 (2007, 2012) 1 2 1 6 1 (1963) 2 3 1 (1975) 1 1 (2022) 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Total (68th) 68 66 49 48 36 267 Note: 1954 Third place . 1966 Title Shared between and . 1957 Third place Shared between and . ==Awards== ===Golden Player Award=== For certain tournaments, the official website UEFA.com subsequently named a Golden Player.
