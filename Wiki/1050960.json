 "text": "The variable bubble-nest frog or variable bush frog (Pseudophilautus variabilis) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place. This frog is extinct. None of them are alive today. Scientists saw it in Sri Lanka in 1858, but they have never seen it again. Scientists found one adult female frog that was 35.7 mm long from nose to rear end. There was fringed skin and some webbed skin on her feet. Scientists believe that these animals hatched out of eggs as small frogs. They believe they never swam as tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
