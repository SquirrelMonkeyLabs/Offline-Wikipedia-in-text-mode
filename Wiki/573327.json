The order tells agencies and officers of the Federal government of the United States things that they must do. Executive orders can be stopped by the courts in a process called judicial review. They may be stopped if they are against laws or against the Constitution of the United States. Executive orders have a big effect on the internal affairs of government. They decide how and to what degree legislation will be enforced. They also deal with emergencies and wars. Category:United States law",
