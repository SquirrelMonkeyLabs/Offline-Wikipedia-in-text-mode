Due to this, he became famous as a notorious criminal in the government of the East India Company. His kingdom was spread over a large area of Mohammadi district of the United Province. Mitauli village of Khiri district of present-day Uttar Pradesh was the capital of his kingdom. There was a huge fort and temple here, which was destroyed by the British forces when the British rule was reestablished after the revolt of 1857. Its ruins are still present at this place, in which a mound, an ancient well and some parts of the temple can be seen. == Mitauli == Mitauli, which was once known as Mitaulgarh, in 1856 when the East India Company started acquiring these areas, Raja Lone Singh of Mitauli opposed this acquisition, along with Begum Hazrat Mahal got his son Birjis Qadr crowned and along with Begum Hazrat Mahal led the freedom struggle against the British rule in entire Awadh. Raja Lone Singh did not let Mitauli come under the control of the British for a year.
