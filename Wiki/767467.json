It first opened in 1972, and is part of the long A38 road.The Motorway Archive A38(M) – Dates The motorway is strange as it has seven lanes with no barrier in the middle. Electronic signs above the motorway tell drivers which lanes they can use with either a green tick or red cross. Motorcycles are banned from the middle lane because drains on the ground can make them crash.CBRD Motorway Database – A38(M) ==Junctions== A38(M) motorway Northbound exits Junction Southbound exits Road continues to Erdington as A5127 M6 J6 Gravelly Hill (Gravelly Hill Interchange) () Start of motorway Lichfield A38 No exit The SOUTH, Coventry The NORTH WEST, Wolverhampton M6 Aston A5127 No exit No exit Park Circus () Aston B4132 Start of motorway Dartmouth Circus () Handsworth, Ladywood, Aston, Small Heath A4540 (Birmingham Inner Ring Road) Handsworth, Ladywood, Aston, Small Heath A4540 (Birmingham Inner Ring Road) Road continues as A38 to Birmingham City Centre ==References== Category:Motorways in England Category:Buildings and structures in Birmingham",
