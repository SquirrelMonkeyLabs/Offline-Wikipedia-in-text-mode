 "text": "Franco-Provençal (also Francoprovençal, Patois, Gaga, Savoyard or Arpitan) is a dialect group within Gallo-Romance originally spoken in east-central France, western Switzerland and northwestern Italy. Franco-Provençal is also spoken in rural areas of French-speaking Switzerland. In France, it is one of the three Gallo-Romance language families of the country (together with the langues d'oïl and the langues d'oc), and it is officially recognized as a regional language of France, but its use in the country is not widespread. Still, organizations are trying to keep it alive through cultural events, education, research, and publishing. == References == == Other websites == * Arpitan Cultural Alliance, International Federation * Francoprovencal.org Le site du francoprovençal * Centre d'Études Francoprovençales of Saint-Nicolas, Aosta Valley Category:Romance languages",
