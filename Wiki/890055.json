Who.int. Retrieved 2023-08-20 ==Information from 2022== Omicron multiplies around 70 times faster than the Delta variant in the bronchi, but it is less severe than other strains, especially the Delta variant. Omicron might be less able to enter deep lung tissue. Omicron infections are 91 percent less fatal than the delta variant, with 51 percent less risk of hospitalization. Vaccines can protect against severe disease and hospitalisation especially after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is given. Early data found that double vaccination give 30 to 40 percent protection against infection and around 70 percent protection against hospitalization. A recent third vaccine dose boosts effectiveness against infection to around 75 percent, and 88 percent for severe disease. ==Related pages== *Variants of SARS-CoV-2 ==References== Category:COVID-19 pandemic Category:November 2021 events Category:December 2021 events Category:January 2022 events Category:February 2022 events",
