Favoritner FC Vorwärts 06 Wien was a Austrian football club from the Favoriten district of Vienna. ==History== The club was founded on 4 December 1906 as the Sportclub Favoritner Vorwärts. The club colors were set with black and white. Role models were the district neighbors ASV Hertha Vienna and SpC Rudolfshügel. For the championship, the club was classified in the 2nd class. In the first official championship season in 1911/12, the club finished in good fifth place. With the outbreak of the First world war in 1914, they stopped because most of the players were drafted into military service. Immediately after the end of the war, former players and officials got together in 1918 to reactivate the club. The club was also renamed 1. Favoritner FC Vorwärts 06 Vienna. In the 1919/20 season they came back into the 2nd Class, but only came last and were relegated to the Third Class North. After two seasons in this class they became champion and should be promoted to 2. Class A. Due to accusation that the club had used unauthorized players and that witnesses close to him had made false statements, 1. FFC Vorwärts 06 was excluded from the association. After clarification of this matter,Vorwärts was allowed to play again in the 2nd class south in the 1923/24 season. The next years became an integral part of the second class. In the 1941/42 season they came second behind the BSG Reichsbahn I. The next season they became champion but had to play two relegation matches versus SC Austria Donauarbeiter. With an score of 5:2 Vorwärts had qualified for the promotion round to the Gauliga. In the promotion round itself two victories against the Fußballgemeinschaft Salzburg and a draw against SK Amateure Steyr were only enough for second place behind Steyer. In the 1945/46 season they qualified for the 1st class in Vienna, from which the Favoritner were relegated in the following season. After years in the lower classes the game operation was stopped in 2014. ==References== Category:Football clubs of Vienna Category:Defunct football clubs Category:Austrian football clubs Category:1906 establishments in Europe Category:1900s establishments in Austria Category:2014 disestablishments in Europe",
