Nirvana formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987 by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, with the band having many different drummers. The band released its first album, Bleach, in 1989 on the record label Sub Pop. After being joined by drummer Dave Grohl, the band released its second album Nevermind, which is now one of the best- selling alternative rock albums of all time. and popularized the Seattle grunge movement and alternative music. The band's third studio album, In Utero (1993), was also very popular, but not as popular as Nevermind. Nirvana ended in 1994 after Cobain died. Some compilation, live and box-set albums were released after this. ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== Title Album details Chart positions Sales Certifications (sales thresholds) US AUS Australian (ARIA Chart) peaks: * Peaks within the top 50: * Peaks between 51–100 until December 2010: * For: Sliver: The Best of the Box: AUT CAN * For album peaks before and up to the year 2000: * For album peaks after the year 2000: FIN JPN * For before and up to 2005: Album Chart-Book Complete Edition 1970–2005.
