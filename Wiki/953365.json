 "text": "The yellow heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes wuchereri) is a frog. It lives in the Brazil. It lives in the state of Bahia, in the Atlantic forest. People have seen this frog 400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 25.1-26.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 26.2-27.1 mm. The skin of the back and backs of the legs is brown. There is a white stripe from each eye down to the end of the body. There are vomerine teeth in the frog's jaw. The adult male frog has an adult nuptial pad on each front foot. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. It lives in rainforest that has never been cut down, forest that was cut down and grew back, and places where humans cut down some of the trees to make places that are shady but not too shady so they can plant cacao farms. Scientists say that as long as human beings like to plant and grow cacao, the frog will have a place to live. The male frogs can fight each other over good places to live and find female frogs. The frogs live on bromeliad plants. The female frog lays eggs in the bromeliads and the tadpoles swim and grow in the pools water that collects near the middle of the plant. There is only one tadpole in each pool of water but sometimes more than one pool in the same plant. Scientists think this frog might be in danger if human beings take away their bromeliad plants, but they don't think anyone is doing this as of 2023. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
