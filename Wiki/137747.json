 "text": "The MacBook is a type of laptop computer made by Apple Inc. It runs macOS and comes with a built in webcam and microphone and a power adapter that is attached by magnets or USB-C. The very last (and now discontinued) MacBooks were last available housed in Silver, Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold aluminium. Many college students purchase MacBooks to help with their studies and to stay connected with their family and friends. The first models were released in 2006. It now has the same \"unibody\" construction as the MacBook Pro's. ==History== The MacBook was introduced by Apple in May 2006. It replaced the iBook and 12 inch PowerBook series of notebooks because Apple was switching all of their CPUs to Intel from Power PC's. In October 2008, Apple decided to make a MacBook housed in aluminum. It was pretty much the same as the one housed in plastic except that it was a little better and that it was housed in metal. In June 2009, during WWDC (Apple's big yearly gathering), this laptop was renamed the MacBook Pro 13 inch. In 2015 Apple released 12-inch MacBook, with a smaller Retina display. After all of this, Apple subsequently stopped MacBook sales and production on June 30, 2023. ==References== ==Other websites== *MacBook website Category:MacBook Category:Apple hardware Category:Laptops",
