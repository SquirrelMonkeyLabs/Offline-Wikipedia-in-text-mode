 "text": "Rebel News (also known as The Rebel Media and The Rebel) is a right-wing Canadian news and politics website. It created by Ezra Levant in 2015. He described it as the Breitbart News of Canada. Many people say that it is alt- right but Levant says that it is not. In the midst of the 2021 Canadian federal election, Justin Trudeau accused Rebel News of spreading misinformation, especially about COVID-19 vaccines. ==References== Category:News websites Category:Websites established in the 2010s Category:Toronto Category:Canadian websites",
