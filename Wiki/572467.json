 "text": "The yellowjacket (or yellow jacket) is a wasp from the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula. In some English-speaking countries, they are called wasps. Most are black and yellow. Some are black and white. Yellowjackets are sometimes confused with bees because they have rather similar colouring. Yellowjackets have a stinger with a small barb. They may sting repeatedly. The diet of an adult yellowjacket is usually sugars and carbohydrates. They are important predators of other insects because they feed their larvae (grubs) with chewed-up insects. They are native to North America and parts of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. ==References== Category:Wasps",
