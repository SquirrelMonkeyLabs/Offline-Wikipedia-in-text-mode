It is one of the predominant bees found and domesticated in Southern Asia, particularly in Pakistan, and far as Thailand and mainland Asia. Relatively non-aggressive and rarely exhibiting swarming behaviour, it is ideal for beekeeping. It is considered as the “National Insect of Pakistan” respectively. It is similar to the European honey bee (Apis mellifera), which tends to be slightly larger and can be easily distinguished.
