By 16 January 2019, President Uhuru Kenyatta said that 14 people had been killed, including all the terrorists. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement that was released during the attack. Mohammed Gichunge was the shooter but was quickly shot down by Kenya's Rekke Squad - an equivalent to America's SWAT. His accomplice and girlfriend fled to Somalia. The hotel was reopened in August. ==References== Category:2019 mass shootings Category:2019 explosions in Africa Category:2010s murders in Africa Category:Al-Shabaab (militant group) Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2019 Category:Attacks on hotels Category:Building bombings in Africa Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2019 Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in Africa Category:January 2019 events Category:Mass murder in 2019 Category:Mass murder in Africa Category:2010s mass shootings in Africa Category:History of Kenya DusitD2 complex attack Category:Suicide bombings in 2019 Category:Suicide bombings in Africa Category:Terrorist incidents in Africa in the 2010s",
