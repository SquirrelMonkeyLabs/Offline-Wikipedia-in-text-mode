The Holt Radium Institute was a research centre which ran a radiotherapy service. Ralston Paterson was the Director of the Radium Institute in 1931, and built a world recognised centre for the treatment of cancer by radiation. New research laboratories, provided by the Women's Trust Fund and named after the Patersons, were opened in 1966. It changed its name to the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute in 2013. It was destroyed by fire in 2017. It was rebuilt and reopened in 2023. The new building is 25,000 square metres and ten storeys high, more than twice the size of the earlier building, The Christie registers around 12,500 new patients and treats about 60,000 patients every year.
