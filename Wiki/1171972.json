 "text": "Don Jose M. Ynares Sr. Memorial National High School is a public secondary school located in Barangay San Carlos, Binangonan, Rizal, Philippines. It was originally established as a satellite school or annex of Vicente Madrigal National High School, eventually standing as an independent school, in 1998. Its campus is located at Barangay San Carlos civic complex. ==Eponym== The school is named in honor of Don Jose Ynares, the town of Binangonan's pioneer steward in the early years of American occupation. Binangonan became an independent municipality by virtue of General Order No. 40 of the Taft Commission. In 1901, Don Jose Ynares Y Granados was appointed Presidente (equivalent to today's town mayor) by the American Civil Governor. He won the first municipal election held in the following year and served for four years holding office at his house as the Presidencia (referring to the American-era version of the casa real, and eventually evolving to the present day munisipyo or town hall). With help from the American regime, Ynares made remarkable improvements to the town, and the school named after him officially honors his stature as Binangonan's first Mayor. ==References== Category:High schools in the Philippines Category:Education in the Philippines",
