 "text": "Paul Aussaresses (7 November 1918 â€“ 4 December 2013) was a French Army general. He fought during World War II, the First Indochina War and Algerian War. His actions during the Algerian War, and later defense of those actions, caused considerable controversy. He was perhaps best known for wearing an eye patch. Aussaresses was badly criticized in 2000, when in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, he defended the use of torture during the Algerian war. He repeated the defense in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, further arguing that torture ought to be used in the fight against Al-Qaeda. Aussaresses died on 4 December 2013 from natural causes in Sainte-Marie-aux- Mines, France, aged 95. ==References== ==Other websites== * Torture to Prevent Terrorism?
