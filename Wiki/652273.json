His debut album Finally Rich was released in December 2012, and featured the successful singles \"I Don't Like\" and \"Love Sosa\". ==Controversies== ===Grooming allegations=== In 2023, Keef, who was then 27, and then 28 years old was accused of grooming porn actress and former rapper Bhad Bhabie, who was then 19, and then 20 years old, due to the seven year age difference in their past relationship, Bhabie then took to Twitter to deny the allegations, claiming that she wasn't groomed since she was already over the age of consent while they dated, and also tweeted that she was confused about why a seven year age difference in a relationship is more controversial between a 20 and a 27 year old then a 30 and a 37 year old, Keef, however, has not spoken on the situation. ==References== Category:1995 births Category:American trap musicians Category:Gangsta rappers Category:Living people Category:Rappers from Illinois Category:American record producers Category:Singers from Chicago Category:Musicians from Chicago",
