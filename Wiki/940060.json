An update in January 2022 added support for marking whole videos as sponsorships. ==Usage== Users submit segments of videos and choose a category for them. Those segments are automatically skipped. When a segment is skipped, a small pop-up appears for a few seconds to allow the user to vote on it or \"unskip\" it. The number of segments each user has submitted and skipped is tracked. ==Reception== The extension was on Mozilla's Extension Spotlight on July 21, 2020, and is the highest rated recommended Firefox extension. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Cross-platform software Category:YouTube",
