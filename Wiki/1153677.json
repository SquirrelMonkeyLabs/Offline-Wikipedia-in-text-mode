It's situated on the Grand Trunk Road, between Ludhiana and Ambala. The town has a rich history dating back to the 12th century and was once an important center of trade and commerce. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Sirhind was a key location in the conflicts between the Mughal Empire, the Sikhs, and the Afghans. The town was occupied by various rulers, including the Mughals, the Sikhs, and the Afghans., One of the most significant events in Sirhind's history was the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's two younger sons, aged 9 and 7, who were executed by the Mughal governor, Wazir Khan, in 1705. This event led to a long-standing feud between the Sikhs and the Mughals., In 1710, the Sikhs, led by Banda Singh Bahadur, attacked Sirhind and killed Wazir Khan. The town was later occupied by the Afghans and then by the Sikhs again. In 1764, the Dal Khalsa, a Sikh army, defeated the Mughal governor, Zain Khan, and occupied Sirhind. Today, Sirhind is a thriving town with several historic monuments, including the Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib, which commemorates the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's sons. The town also has a mausoleum of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a famous Sufi saint. ==References== Category:Settlements in Punjab, India",
