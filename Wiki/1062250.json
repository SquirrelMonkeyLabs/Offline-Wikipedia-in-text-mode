 "text": "Intef the elder was an important Theban ruler during First Intermediate Period, and the founder of 11th dynasty. The Royal List of Karnak mentioned as predecessor of Mentuhothep I. ==Biography== Intef the Elder was not a pharaoh, but the ruler of Thebes around 2150 BC. In this role, he would have served either a king of the 8th Dynasty or one of the Herakleopolitan kings of the 9th or 10th Dynasty. Intef the Elder’s control would have been from Thebes to Aswan in the south, but not farther north than Coptos, which was then controlled by another dynasty of governers. It is believed that Intef the Elder was the father of his successor on the Theban throne, Mentuhotep I. Darrell D.

This stele is currently in the Egyptian Museum (CG 20009). The stele provides information about Intef’s titles and indicates that he served an unnamed pharaoh.Darrell D.
