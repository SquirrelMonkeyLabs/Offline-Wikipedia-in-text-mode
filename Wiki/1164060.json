In a place called Baghdad near Baghdad, Safavid reconnaissance forces sent to watch the Ottoman forces saw the Ottoman army and the battle started. Safavid reconnaissance forces won the battle. Arab guides played a role in the battle. ==Ottoman Iranıan Events (1502-1512)== ===Ottman Safavid Clashes=== ====Ottoman Safavid Clashes (1502)==== Prince Selim, the governor of Trabzon, embarked on a series of military operations in 1502. He captured the castles of Bayburd, Kemah, İspir and Kovans and ensured the security of the region up to Erzurum. Ferruhşad Bey and Mansur Bey, two of the Akkoyunlu beys of this region, took refuge in Prince Selim and became his subjects. It is understood that Ferruhşad Bey informed Prince Selim about Shah Ismail’s activities in the region, his massacres and the current situation in the region. ===Trabzon Exppedetions=== ====Trabzon Expedetion (1505)==== Shah Ismail's brother Ibrahim set out with an army of 3,000 to plunder the province held by Selim with only 450 soldiers, Selim repelled the Safavids and chased them to Erzincan, massacring many of them and seizing their weapons and ammunition selim then sent a separate force to raid the Safavids' western lands after the war of 1505, Shah Ismail sent an envoy to Bayezid II, complaining about Selim's excessively aggressive raids and demanding the return of the weapons of the soldiers he had captured.Bayezid II did not return the weapons, but sent the envoy back with gifts and promises of friendship. ====Trabzon Expedetion (1510)==== In 1510, Shah Ismail sent another military unit to the province that Selim had successfully defended in 1505. Shah Ismail's brother crossed Ottoman territory and marched to Trebizond, but was defeated by Selim. ===Shahkulu Rebellion=== Şahkulu started a rebellion in Antalya and this rebellion took over a large part of central Anatolia, but Şahkulu, who heard about the army sent by Beyazıt, fled to Çubukova or Gökçay, but was found and killed in Gökçay, but Ali Pasha also died in the war. ==Ottoman-Iranian War (1514-1519)== ===Battle of Chaldıran=== Some reasons for the Ottoman Empire's campaign against the Safavid State: The Shahkulu and Nurali Caliph rebellions, Shiite propaganda in Anatolia and the burning of the Tokat, etc. Selim I went on a campaign and defeated Shah Ismail and advanced to Tabriz, also in this war Shah Ismail's wife was taken prisoner and Selim, who entered Tabriz, wanted to continue his campaign against the Safavids, but he gave up as a result of the rebellions.Uzunçarşılı, 1986, s. 23-76Możṭar, ed., p. 508Montaẓer-e Ṣāḥeb, ed., p. 534Ḥasan Rumlu, I p. 196 === Battle of Urfa (1514) === The Ottoman Sultan Yavuz Sultan Selim Khan, during his Iran campaign in 1514 , sent a force under the command of Murat Bey, one of the Akkoyunlu princes who had taken refuge in the Ottoman Empire , to capture Diyarbakır . However, Eçe Sultan Kaçar, who was the governor of Urfa at the time , defeated this force. Thus, Urfa remained in Safavid hands for a while longer . ===Euphrates-Tigris Expedition=== The Ottomans did some things in Eastern Anatolia after the Battle of Chaldiran. They defeated and killed Nur Ali Khalifa in Tekiryayagli (Ovacik). They attacked and captured the Kemah Castle.bkz.Imber Then they attacked Diyabakir and captured it again. Then they defeated the Safavids in the Battle of Kochisar and captured 27 cities. === Battle of Diyarbakır (1519) === Div Sultan (the man appointed by Shah Ismail as governor of Diyarbakir) wrote to the Shah asking for permission to march against them. When the Shah heard this news, he asked him to wait. The Shah gathered an army of 18,000 and engaged the Ottoman army of 50,000, killing almost all of them. After the Safavids won, they continued to fight many battles, such as the Battle of Urfa, recapturing most of the territory and 42 fortresses.Aləmara-yi Şah İsmayıl. 573–580.Aləmara-yi Səfəvi. 553–560.Süleymanov, Mehman. Şah İsmayılın Sefevi. 555–556. === Attack of Kara Ahmed Castle (1519) === After the Ottomans captured 42 castles, they attacked the Kara Ahmed Castle and Ahmed Sultan was forced to leave the Kara Ahmed Castle and set off towards Diyarbakır. Thus, the Kara Ahmed Castle also came under the control of the Ottoman troops. The cited sources state that in this way, 42 castles under the control of the Safavid forces in the region came under the control of the Ottoman forces without a fight. === Canberdi Ghazali Rebellion === According to information provided by Venetian sources, when the former Mamluk commander Can Birdi al-Gazzali started a rebellion against the Ottomans after the death of Sultan Selim (November 1520), Shah Ismail came to the Ottoman borders to help him, but returned to Gazvin because the rebellion was suppressed and Can Birdi al-Gazzali died. Again, according to the same source, Safavid rule played a role in the planning of this rebellion.Allouche 2001: 142-143 == Ottoman–Iranian War (1532–1555) == === Two İraqi Expedetion === The Ottomans, first under the Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha, and later joined by Suleiman himself, successfully attacked Safavid Iraq, recaptured Bitlis, and proceeded to capture Tabriz and then Baghdad in 1534. === Ottoman-Safavid War (1548-1549) === During the reign of Grand Vizier Rustem Pasha, while the Ottomans were trying to defeat the Shah decisively, Suleiman launched a second campaign in 1548–1549. Tahmasp again adopted a scorched earth policy, devastating Armenia, but Suleiman achieved gains in Tabriz, captured Persian- held Armenia, established a permanent presence in the province of Van in eastern Anatolia, and captured some fortresses in Georgia.The Cambridge history of Iran by William Bayne Fisher p.384ff === Ottoman Safavid War (1554–1555) === In 1553 the Ottomans, first under the Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha, and later joined by Suleiman himself, began his third and final campaign against the Shah, in which he first lost and then regained Erzurum. Ottoman territorial gains were secured by the Peace of Amasya in 1555. Suleiman returned Tabriz, but kept Baghdad, lower Mesopotamia, western Armenia, western Georgia, the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris, and part of the Persian Gulf coast. Persia retained the rest of all its northwestern territories in the Caucasus.Scherberger 2014, p. 60. == Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590) == The Ottoman Empire launched a new Eastern Expedition 23 years after signing the Amasya Treaty with the Safavids in 1555, and declared war again in 1578 Mathee, 2018, p. 115. The Safavids' renewed provocation of the Qizilbash groups, who were supporters of the Ottomans during the reign of Shah Ismail II, the movements seen on the Ottoman-Iranian border, and the Sunnis of Shirvan asking for help from the Ottomans were effective in starting this expedition. On the other hand, the Ottoman administrators, who wanted to take advantage of the chaos in Iran, aimed to force the Safavids to make peace by seizing some strategic points and plundering and destroying places belonging to the Safavids Kütükoğlu, 1993, p. 23, 29. Sultan III. During the reign of Murad (1574-1595), the Ottomans aimed to establish Ottoman power in Azerbaijan and Georgia and to keep Russia, which was emerging as a new power, under control Uluerler, 2012, p. 10. Indeed, while these military campaigns continued successfully during the reign of Murad III, when a full peace was about to be made upon the application of Safavid Shah Hunabende, the fact that Abbas I, who replaced him, did not want peace continued these struggles for a while. However, since the Safavids were unable to fight on two fronts with both the Ottomans and the Uzbeks, peace negotiations were brought back to the agenda. Finally, with the 1590 Ferhad Pasha (Istanbul) Treaty concluded in Istanbul with the efforts of Grand Vizier Ferhad Pasha, the Ottoman Empire gained control of important places such as Tabriz, all of Azerbaijan, Shirvan, Georgia, Luristan and Shahrizor. Shah Abbas was also forced to accept not to use insulting expressions about the first three caliphs of Islam (Abu Bakr, Omar, Osman) and the Prophet's wife, Aisha Uzunçarşılı, 1988,II, p. 245Uzunçarşılı, 1988,III, p. 245. == Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618) == Shah Abbas restarted the Ottoman-Safavid war by attacking Tabriz in 1603. He then captured Revan. Thus, the Safavids gained control of Azerbaijan. After suppressing the Jelali rebellions in the country, the Ottoman Empire sent Kuyucu Murad Pasha to Tabriz in 1610. However, although Murad Pasha marched on the Safavids, he had to retreat from Azerbaijan without fighting. Two years after this incident (1612), a forced agreement was made during the Nasuh Pasha period . Because this agreement signed between the two parties did not last very long and after three years, tensions re-emerged on the Ottoman-Safavid borders. Indeed, after the Safavids broke the peace of Nasuh Pasha, the Ottoman Empire broke its common alliance with Iran in 1615.They initiated actions by sending an army towards their borders and the Caucasus. The Ottomans called on the tribes settled on the border to revolt and put the Kizilbash to the sword in the Kakheti region, and also led the Sunni Shirvan people to revolt. In response to these attempts by the Ottomans, Shah Abbas sent Davud Bin Levarsab's son Begrat Mirza to the Kartli government and assigned Kurchakay Bey to manage Georgia's affairs in order to fix the situation. In response, the Ottomans moved towards the Caucasus with the soldiers they gathered from Anatolia, Diyarbakır, Mosul and Erzurum and accompanied by the Kurdish tribes in the border region and blockaded the Erivan Castle. As a result, these wars, which resulted in the Ottoman defeat, ended with the Treaty of Serav signed in 1618 ==Ottoman Safavid Wars (1623-1639)== On March 18, 1635, when the Iranians IV crossed the Ottoman border and attacked and plundered Ottoman lands and when these plunder increased, he set out on an expedition against the Iranian State. After completing the necessary preparations, the Ottoman Army marched towards Revan with Sultan IV. Murat at its head. During the long march of approximately 3 months, discipline was perfect. On July 27, 1635, Murad IV reached the front of Revan, an important Safavid castle. On July 28, 1635, the castle was besieged. The Ottoman cannons pounded the castle walls. The Iranians in the city initially tried to resist with all their might; but before the Ottomans launched a major general attack, the Iranians informed the sultan that they would surrender the castle. On August 8, 1635, Emirguneoğlu Yusuf Pasha, the guardian of the Revan castle, surrendered the castle to Murad IV. Thus, Revan and its surroundings were captured after an 8-day siege. (1635) Since this castle was captured in a short time and with little loss, Sultan IV. Murat's superiority among the people increased. Revan Castle was repaired and reconstructed. 12,000 soldiers and ammunition were placed in the castle. Murtaza Pasha was appointed as the castle guard. However, Revan was lost again when the Ottoman Army returned to Istanbul. Thereupon, a second expedition was necessary. On April 1, 1636, the Iranians crossed the Ottoman border and occupied Revan Castle again. Thereupon, IV. Murad and the Eastern Commander, Grand Vizier Bayram Pasha, set out on an expedition against Iran on May 8, 1637. The Sultan arrived in front of Baghdad and laid siege to the city on November 16, 1638. There was an army of 40,000 men in Baghdad under the command of Bektash Khan. Shah Safi was staying in Kasr-ı Şirin with his cavalry army but did not dare to intervene in the siege. IV. Murad sent 12,000 sipahis into the interior of Iran and had the Shahban region plundered and destroyed. But the Shah could not confront the Sultan. He thought and hoped that he would withdraw when he got tired of the siege. Great clashes took place in which Murad IV and Sheikhulislam Yahya Efendi were also in the front lines. On the 37th day of the siege, Grand Vizier Tayyar Mehmed Pasha, who had captured several Iranian towers, was shot and martyred. Kemankeş Kara Mustafa Pasha was appointed as the Grand Vizier by the Sultan in his place. Kemankeş Mustafa Pasha captured several towers around Baghdad. Following these successes, a great general attack was launched on the 39th day of the siege. This attack in the early morning hours resulted in great battles and conflicts. Finally, Baghdad, which could not resist any longer, fell. IV. Murad first visited the tombs of Imam-i Azam and Abdulkadir-i Geylani. These tombs were built and repaired under the supervision of Sheikh-ul-Islam Yahya Efendi. The Sultan left the army and the Grand Vizier in Baghdad and returned to Istanbul. Shah I. Safi requested peace. As a result of the talks held between Grand Vizier Kemankeş Mustafa Pasha, Iranian ambassador Saru Khan and Iranian delegate Muhammed Kuli Khan, the Kasr-ı Şirin Treaty, which determined the Turkish-Iranian border, was signed on May 17, 1639 and the Ottoman-Iranian war officially ended ==references==",
