 "text": "The Mossi people is an ethnic group that mostly resides in Western Africa. Oral legend claims that the Mossi are descended from a marriage between a Mandé hunter and Yennenga, a princess of the Mamprusi/Dagomba tribe. Naa Gbewaa, a monarch from what is now northern Ghana, had a warrior princess named Yennenga as a daughter. Pusiga, in Ghana's Upper East Region, is where Gbewaa's tomb is situated. According to legend, she became lost while riding through her realm and was saved by a lone Mandé hunter named Rialé. Ouedraogo, their son, is acknowledged as the father of the Mossi people. They were married. Category:Ethnic groups in Africa",
