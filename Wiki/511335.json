 "text": "An Indian reservation is a place in the United States where Native Americans manage their own land under the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. They are not managed by the state governments. There are currently 326 Indian reservations. Some tribes do not have their own reservations. In some cases a reservation may be shared by two or more tribes. The 2000 United States census showed a larger number of Native Americans and Alaska Natives no longer lived on Indian reservations. Many now live in larger cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas.For Los Angeles, see Allen, J. P. and E. Turner, 2002. Text and map of the metropolitan area show the widespread urban distribution of California and other Indians. == References == == Other websites == * BIA A full-size map of Indian reservations in the United States * List of Indian reservations * What is a reservation? *BBC Bitesize Category:Subdivisions of the United States Category:Native Americans",
