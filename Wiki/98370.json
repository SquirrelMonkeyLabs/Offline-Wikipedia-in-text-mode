 "text": "The Eastern Front of World War I was the theatre in which Germany and Austria- Hungary fought against the Russian Empire. Planning places to concentrate forces was very important because there were few railways on the Eastern Front, and troops could not be moved and reinforced as quickly as on the Western Front. Russia lost many battles, but its overall situation improved as Russia improved its forces, and more and more allies entered the war. The Eastern Front ended when the Russian Civil War broke out in 1917. The communists signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany so that they could focus on winning the civil war. ==Other websites== * WWI Eastern Front Photo. * WWI Eastern Front Part II * With the Russian army, 1914-1917 by Alfred Knox Category:World War I",
