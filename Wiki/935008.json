 "text": "The leader of the Soviet Union (, romanised: Lider Sovetskogo Soyuza) was an informal term for the most important political figure in the Soviet Union. It was the de facto leader of the country. The leader controlled the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and the Red Army, often held the title of CPSU General Secretary. The state representative, head of state (president) or head of government (premier) weren't always necessarily the leader as under the Soviet Union's party-state system, CPSU roles were politically more important than state titles. However, most of the Soviet leaders were also the president and premier. The leader was the most power title in the country as all of the individuals who held the position except Georgy Malenkov were the most powerful figures in the country. *",
