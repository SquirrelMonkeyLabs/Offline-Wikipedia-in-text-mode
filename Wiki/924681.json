The organization was doing a strike on the 7th of October 2019 at Lower Manhattan, New York City. The strike was willingly joined by 300,000 people. One of her notable actions was that she doused fake blood on the Charging Bull in Wall Street. In response to the \"2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference\", she founded \"Polluters Out\" with Isabella Fallahi and Helena Gualinga. The organization was created because they had realised that fossil fuel industries are playing a big part in the issues. The fossil fuel companies who funded in the event include Endesa, Iberdrola, Banco Santander and Acciona. One of the companies which was affected by this decision was British Petroleum. == References == Category:Living people Category:1999 births Category:Environmentalists",
