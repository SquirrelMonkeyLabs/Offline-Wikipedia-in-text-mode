People could build up to 128,000 bricks on every server to keep the game running best. In 2009, Lego were talking to Eric \"Badspot\" Hartman about selling Blockland. It has been talked about by The Screen Savers and Shack News. In 2005, when Blockland was in beta, Blockland was on an article on Globe and Mail in which Eric says 20,000 people downloaded Blockland in the ten days since it \"became big\". Right now, the full game costs $20. == References == == Other websites == *Blockland Official Website Category:2004 video games Category:2007 video games Category:Indie video games Category:MacOS games Category:Open-world video games Category:Windows games",
