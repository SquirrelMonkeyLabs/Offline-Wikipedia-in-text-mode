 "text": "The Argentine Senate is the upper house of the Argentine National Congress. It has 72 senators. There are three for each province and three for Buenos Aires. There used to be 2 senators from each province. That was changed in 1994. Senators are elected by direct election on a provincial basis. The party with the most votes is given two of the province's senate seats. The second-place party gets the third seat. Currently one-third of the members are elected every two years to a six-year term. In other words, one-third of the provinces hold senate elections every two years. ==Requirements== According to Section 55 of the Argentine Constitution, candidates for the Argentine Senate must * be at least 30 years old * have been a citizen of Argentina for six years * be native to the province of his office, or have been a resident of that province for two years. ==Authorities== Current leadership positions include: Title Officeholder Caucus Province President of the Senate Cristina Fernández de Kirchner Frente de Todos Buenos Aires Provisional President Claudia Ledesma Abdala Frente de Todos Santiago del Estero Vice President Carolina Losada Juntos por el Cambio Santa Fe First Vice President Maurice Closs Frente de Todos Misiones Second Vice President Guadalupe Tagliaferri Juntos por el Cambio Buenos Aires Parliamentary Secretary Marcelo Fuentes colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" Administrative Secretary María Luz Alonso First Minority Leader José Mayans Frente de Todos Formosa Second Minority Leader Alfredo Cornejo Juntos por el Cambio Mendoza == References == Senate Category:National upper houses",
