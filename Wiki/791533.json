 "text": "The stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star. It is found above the convection zone. == Structure == The stellar atmosphere is divided into several layers: * The photosphere is the lowest and coolest layer of the stellar atmosphere. The Sun's photosphere has a temperature of 5,770 K to 5,780 K. * The chromosphere is the next layer after the photosphere. The chromosphere is above the photosphere. Its about 10 times the temperature of the photosphere. * The transition region is the next layer after the chromosphere. It is hotter than the chromosphere. * The outermost part of the stellar atmosphere is the corona. It has a temperature of 1,000,000 K. It seems that only some giant stars, and very few supergiant stars, have a corona. == References == Category:Atmosphere Atmosphere",
