 "text": "The Mazsihisz (short for Magyarországi Zsidó Hitközségek Szövetsége) is the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities. It is the largest Jewish organization in Hungary, representing many Jewish communities across the country. Mazsihisz helps preserve Jewish culture, history, and traditions in Hungary. It manages synagogues, cemeteries, and Jewish schools, and organizes religious services and events. The organization also supports Holocaust remembrance and works to combat antisemitism. Mazsihisz works with other Jewish groups and international organizations to strengthen Jewish life and protect the interests of the Jewish community in Hungary. == History == In 1950, the communist regime forced all Jewish religious groups and communities in Hungary to merge into one organization called the Hungarian Israelite National Representation (MIOK). After the change of regime in 1991, Mazsihisz was formed from the restructuring of MIOK. Mazsihisz’s president and executive director are elected every two years by the general assembly, which is made up of 12 members representing local communities from across Hungary and rabbis from Budapest. The Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities represents Hungarian Jewry in international Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, the European Jewish Congress, and the Claims Conference. == List of leaders == === Presidents === Péter Feldmájer 1991–1999 Péter Tordai 1999–2003 András Heisler 2003–2005 Péter Feldmájer 2005–2013 András Heisler 2013–2023 Andor Grósz 2023– === Directors === Gusztáv Zoltai 1991–2014 Péter Kunos 2014– ==References== Category:Jewish communities",
