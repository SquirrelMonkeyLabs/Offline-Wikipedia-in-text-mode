 "text": "The official flag of Northern Ireland between 1921 and 1972 was a red cross on a white field defaced with a crowned six-pointed star with a red hand in the centre. The flag was the official flag of the Executive Committee for Northern Ireland (the government of Northern Ireland) between 1921 and 1972. This government went out of existence in 1972 and since that time the United Kingdom has not used the flag. The British Government uses the flag of the United Kingdom. Sometimes, sports teams use the flag to represent Northern Ireland. This flag is known as the Ulster Banner, or more commonly the Northern Ireland flag or Ulster flag. It is not the same as the flag of Ulster. Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland Category:Flags of the United Kingdom",
