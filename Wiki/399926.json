 "text": "The seventh generation of video game consoles began in 2005. Also known as the first motion gaming era, the seventh generation began on November 22, 2005 with the release of the Xbox 360. The PlayStation 3 was released on November 11, 2006. The Wii was released on November 19, 2006. Each new console introduced a new type of breakthrough in technology. The Xbox 360 had games at HD resolutions. The PlayStation 3 included FHD gaming, HD movie playback and a built-in 3D Blu-ray disc player. The Wii's controllers had movement sensors as well as joysticks. Sony released the PlayStation Move in September 2010. This was to compete with Nintendo's other motion controllers. Microsoft released the Kinect. The Kinect does not use any controllers and makes the users the \"controller\". Kinect sold 8 million units in its first 60 days. The Guinness World Record named it the \"fastest selling consumer electronic device\". Both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 controllers can be used wired or wirelessly. The first handheld game console of this generation was the Nintendo DS. ==Video game systems== ===Comparison=== Name Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Wii Logo Manufacturer Microsoft Sony Nintendo Image Release dates More...
