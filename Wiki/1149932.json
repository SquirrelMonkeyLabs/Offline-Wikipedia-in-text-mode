 "text": "On October 1661 Shahaji captured Porto Nova (today Parangipettai). These Ports were captured by Mir Jumala of Golconda but after his desertion to Mughals Sultan of Golconda claimed this lands as his while on other hand Aurangzeb claimed thess Ports. Shahaji taking the advantage of this confusion captured as many territories as he could. ==Battle== By October 1661, Shahaji had taken control of Porto Novo, using it as a stronghold for his attacks on Tanjore. His goal was to capture the coastal towns and extend the power of the Bijapur Sultanate to the east. These towns had previously been ruled by Mir Jumla, but after he switched sides to the Mughal Empire, there was a power struggle. The King of Golconda claimed the territories once controlled by Mir Jumla and sent agents to remove his men. At the same time, Aurangzeb ordered the King of Golconda to pull his forces out of the Carnatic region, though they were reluctant to give up these valuable towns. This period of confusion created an opportunity for Shahaji, and he quickly moved to expand his control. The Sultan of Golconda had trouble enforcing his authority, and it wasnâ€™t until Aurangzeb became firmly established as the Mughal Emperor that he was able to force the King of Golconda to surrender the Carnatic. Taking advantage of the instability, Shahji seized as many towns as he could, strengthening his position in the region. == References == Category:India",
