 "text": "Polypropylene (PP), or polypropene, is a type of plastic. It is a thermoplastic polymer which can be made into a fibre for yarn and fabric, film for packaging, or many other shapes. As a plastic it can be made translucent but usually is opaque and often brightly colored. It is tough, and resists many solvents, acids and bases. It can be formed into a thin thread and woven into a strong strap, often used on backpacks, bags, and other things. In 2008, the global market for polypropylene had a volume of 45.1 million metric tons, which led to a turnover of about $65 billion (â‚¬47.4 billion). ==Sources== Category:Thermoplastics",
