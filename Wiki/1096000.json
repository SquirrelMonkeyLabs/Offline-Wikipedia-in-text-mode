 "text": "Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters (shortly ALLFED) is a nonprofit organization in the USA. It focus on finding solutions how to give food to people in case of big agricultural failure. Such a failure could happen in case of big volcanic eruption, blackout caused by geomagnetic storms, cyber war or nuclear war. To solve this problem the researchers at ALLFED search for resilient foods, which could create enough food for everyone even after global catastrophes. Examples here are resilient plants (like fungi, potatoes or beets) or alternative sources of food (like seaweed, single-cell proteins or leaf protein concentrate). David Denkenberger and Joshua Pearce wrote a book Feeding Everyone No Matter What in 2014. The book discusses different technologies to give food for the humans in case of failure of agriculture. Some years after, he founded the organization Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters to evolve a research on this problem. == Related pages == * Year without a Summer * Nuclear winter * Volcanic winter * Impact winter == References == == Other websites == * Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:Nutrition",
