A major character is Alaska Senator Bliss Wagoner, leader of the Joint Congressional Committee on Space Flight, who is a big role in Humanity's spread into space. At the time of when the book was being written, Alaska was not yet a state and had no senators, but Blish correctly thought that this would be by at least 2013. == Related pages == * List of United States representatives from Alaska * United States congressional delegations from Alaska * Elections in Alaska * List of United States Senate elections in Alaska * Politics of Alaska * Political party strength in Alaska == Other websites == * Alaska Senators, Representatives on GovTrack.us Alaska senators *",
