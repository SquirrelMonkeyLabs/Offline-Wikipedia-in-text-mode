 "text": "An inning is a fixed-length section of a game in several sports – most notably baseball and softball – when one team would try to score while the other team would try to stop the first from scoring. In baseball, a team's turn to score is called a \"half-inning\" instead. A team's scoring turn ends in these sports when the players on the scoring team have been \"put out\" (made to leave the field because of their mistakes during gameplay) a certain number of times. == References == Category:Baseball rules",
