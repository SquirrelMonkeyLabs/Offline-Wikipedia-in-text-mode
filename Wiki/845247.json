 "text": "The Eurovision Young Musicians (French: L'Eurovision des Jeunes Musiciens; abbrev. as EYM or shortened as Young Musicians), is a biennial classical music competition for European musicians that are aged between 12 and 21. It is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and broadcast on television throughout Europe, with some countries holding national elections to choose their representatives for the contest. Some of the competitors are famous musicians like Anna Markland and Paul Meyer. The latest winner of the Eurovision Young Musicians is Daniel Matejča with the piece 3Violin Concerto No. 1 (written by Dmitri Shostakovich) of Czechia. The Eurovision Young Musicians was created by the EBU based on the BBC Young Musician. The first contest took place at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, UK on 11 May 1982 and the last contest celebrated took place at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, UK. The Eurovision Young Musicians 2020 was planned and later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to take place at the King Tomislav Square in Zagreb, Croatia. == List of winners == Year Country Instrument Performer Piece Article 1982 Piano Markus Pawlik Piano Concerto No.1 by Felix Mendelssohn EYM 1982 1984 Violin Isabelle van Keulen Violin concert no. 5 op. 37 by Henri Vieuxtemps EYM 1984 1986 Piano Sandrine Lazarides Piano Concerto E flat by Franz Liszt EYM 1986 1988 Violin Julian Rachlin Concerto for violin and orchestra in d, op.22 by Henryk Wieniawski EYM 1984 1990 Piano Niek van Oosterum Concert for Piano and Orchestra a-minor op. 16, 1 Mov. by Edvard Grieg EYM 1990 1992 Violin Bartłomiej Nizioł Concerto for violin and orchestra in d major op. 77 by Johannes Brahms EYM 1992 1994 Cello Natalie Clein Cello Concerto in E minor, op. 85, part I by Edward Elgar EYM 1994 1996 Violin Julia Fischer Havanaise in E major, op. 83 by Camille Saint-Saëns EYM 1996 1998 Violin Lidia Baich Violin Concerto no. 5, 1st Mov. by Henri Vieuxtemps EYM 1998 2000 Piano Stanisław Drzewiecki Piano Concerto in E minor, op. 11, 3rd movement by Frederic Chopin EYM 2000 2002 Violin Dalibor Karvay Carmen Fantasy by Franz Waxman EYM 2002 2004 Violin Alexandra Soumm Violin Concerto No.1 (1st Movement) by Niccolò Paganini EYM 2004 2006 Cello Andreas Brantelid Concerto for Violoncello and Orchestra, 1st movement by Joseph Haydn EYM 2006 2008 Clarinet Dionysis Grammenos Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra, 4th movement by Jean Françaix EYM 2008 2010 Flute Eva Nina Kozmus Concerto for flute, III. mov.
