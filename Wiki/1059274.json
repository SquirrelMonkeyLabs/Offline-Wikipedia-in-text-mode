 "text": "\"Now and Then\" is a single by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 2 November 2023 as a double A-side single. It is paired with a new mix of the band's first single, \"Love Me Do\" (1962). It has been called \"the last Beatles song\". The song was originally written and recorded by John Lennon around 1977 as a solo piano home demo, but was left unfinished. After Lennon's death in 1980, the song was thought as the third Beatles reunion single. Instead of being included on Anthology 3, the song was shelved for almost thirty years. It was later completed by surviving bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr with singing and included guitar tracks by George Harrison from a 1995 session. The finalized version also has more lyrics by McCartney, and Lennon's voice taken from the original demo using the AI-backed audio restoration technology. Peter Jackson directed the music video for \"Now and Then\". It was announced by iHeartMedia that 740 radio stations owned by them would premiere \"Now and Then\" on 2 November 2023 and would air hourly on their Classic Rock stations. In 2025, \"Now and Then\" won Best Rock Performance and was nominated for Record of the Year in the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. ==References== Category:The Beatles songs Category:2023 songs Category:Grammy Award-winning songs",
