Enki was said to have created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers by masturbating. The planet Mercury was thought to be Enki, but Enki was also shown as a constellation of a man pouring water. He was also associated with the goat-fish, a mythological creature with the head of a goat but the body of a fish. Enki became the Western zodiac sign of Aquarius, while his goat-fish became the sign of Capricorn (Capricornus). == References == Category:Gods and goddesses",
