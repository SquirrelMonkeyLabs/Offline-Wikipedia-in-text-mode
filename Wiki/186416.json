 "text": "Ben Foster (born 3 April 1983) is an English footballer. He is a former England national team goalkeeper who has now retired . He holds the record for having done the most number of saves (1178) in premier league history. Foster started his football career at Racing Club Warwick and in 2001, secured his first transfer to Stoke City. Although considered promising, Foster struggled and could not get regular game-time in his youth days. In 2005, he departed, without playing a single match, from Stoke City after a series of loan spells and joined Manchester United where he played as a back-up to Edwin van der Sar. He was loaned twice, consecutively, for the years 2005-06 and 2006-07 to Watford before spending three more seasons at Manchester United as a substitute goalkeeper. He finally left Manchester United for Birmingham City in 2010. It was from this time that Foster started to get regular starts in all the teams he played till now. At Birmingham City, he instantly established himself in the main eleven for the 2010-11 season. The next season, West Bromwich Albion successfully managed to seal a loan deal with Birmingham City for Foster before finalising the transfer in 2012. He spent a total of seasons at West Brom before leaving the club for Watford in 2018. Since joining Watford, he has been praised several times by analysts for his calm presence in the goal behind a considerably weak Watford defense and has won back-to- back Premier league goalkeeper of the year awards at the London Football Awards. ==Personal life== Born in Leamington Spa, Ben Foster used to work as a chef before he started his career as a footballer. He is currently married to Kate Foster with whom he has 2 children's. The family lives in a self-designed house at Tiddington, Warwickshire. Besides football, Foster has deep interest in cycling and has taken part in various cycling tours. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League League League FA Cup FA Cup League Cup League Cup Europe Europe Other Other Total Total Club Season Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Stoke City 2001–02 Second Division 0 0 0 0 0 0 — — 0 0 0 0 Stoke City 2002–03 First Division 0 0 — — 0 0 — — — — 0 0 Stoke City 2003–04 First Division 0 0 0 0 0 0 — — — — 0 0 Stoke City 2004–05 Championship 0 0 0 0 0 0 — — — — 0 0 Stoke City Total Total 0 0 0 0 0 0 — — 0 0 0 0 Bristol City (loan) 2002–03 Second Division 0 0 0 0 — — — — 0 0 0 0 Tiverton Town (loan) 2002–03 Southern League Premier Division 16 0 — — — — — — — — 16 0 Stafford Rangers (loan) 2003–04 Southern League Premier Division 1 0 — — — — — — — — 1 0 Kidderminster Harriers (loan) 2004–05 League Two 2 0 — — — — — — — — 2 0 Wrexham (loan) 2004–05 League One 17 0 — — — — — — 4 0 21 0 Manchester United 2007–08 Premier League 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 Manchester United 2008–09 Premier League 2 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 9 0 Manchester United 2009–10 Premier League 9 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 13 0 Manchester United Total Total 12 0 3 0 4 0 3 0 1 0 23 0 Watford (loan) 2005–06 Championship 44 0 1 0 0 0 — — 3 0 48 0 Watford (loan) 2006–07 Premier League 29 0 3 0 1 0 — — — — 33 0 Watford (loan) Total Total 73 0 4 0 1 0 — — 3 0 81 0 Birmingham City 2010–11 Premier League 38 0 1 0 4 0 — — — — 43 0 West Bromwich Albion (loan) 2011–12 Premier League 37 0 2 0 0 0 — — — — 39 0 West Bromwich Albion 2012–13 Premier League 30 0 0 0 1 0 — — — — 31 0 West Bromwich Albion 2013–14 Premier League 24 0 1 0 0 0 — — — — 25 0 West Bromwich Albion 2014–15 Premier League 28 0 2 0 0 0 — — — — 30 0 West Bromwich Albion 2015–16 Premier League 15 0 4 0 0 0 — — — — 19 0 West Bromwich Albion 2016–17 Premier League 38 0 0 0 0 0 — — — — 38 0 West Bromwich Albion 2017–18 Premier League 37 0 3 0 1 0 — — — — 41 0 West Bromwich Albion Total Total 209 0 13 0 2 0 — — — — 224 0 Watford 2018–19 Premier League 38 0 0 0 0 0 — — — — 38 0 Watford 2019–20 Premier League 38 0 0 0 0 0 — — — — 38 0 Watford Total Total 76 0 0 0 0 0 — — — — 76 0 Career total Career total Career total 444 0 20 0 11 0 3 0 8 0 486 0 ===International=== Source: Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals England 2007 1 0 England 2009 3 0 England 2010 1 0 England 2013 1 0 England 2014 2 0 Total Total 8 0 ==Honours== Wrexham *Football League Trophy: 2004–05 Watford *Football League Championship play-offs: 2006 *FA Cup runner-up: 2018–19 Manchester United *Football League Cup: 2008–09, 2009–10 Birmingham City *Football League Cup: 2010–11 Individual *Watford Player of the Season: 2006–07 *Alan Hardaker Trophy: 2009, 2011 *Birmingham City Player of the Season: 2010–11 *Birmingham City Players' Player of the Season: 2010–11 *West Bromwich Albion Supporters' Player of the Season: 2011–12, 2013–14 *West Bromwich Albion Players' Player of the Season: 2011–12, 2013–14 *London Football Awards Goalkeeper of the Year: 2018, 2019 ==References== ==Other websites== *Profile at the Watford F.C. website Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:English association football goalkeepers Category:Sportspeople from Warwickshire Category:Premier League players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players",
