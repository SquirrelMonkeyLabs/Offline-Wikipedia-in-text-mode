It has no person, number, mood, or tense. == The infinitive in English == In English, there are two main forms of the infinitive: * the full infinitive (to-infinitive) has the word to at the beginning. For example: I want to run * the bare infinitive does not have the word to. For example: I must go. After a modal verb you must use an infinitive. For example, I must go, he must go (he must goes is not correct) To express time relationships, here are 8 types of infinitives: # simple infinitive, for example, to write # continuous infinitive, for example, to be writing # perfect infinitive, for example, to have written # perfect continuous infinitive, for example, to have been writing # passive simple infinitive, for example, to be written # passive continuous infinitive, for example, to be being writting # passive perfect infinitive, for example, to have been written # passive perfect continuous infinitive, for example, to have been being written == The infinitive in other languages == * In German, the infinitives end with -en, -eln or -ern.
