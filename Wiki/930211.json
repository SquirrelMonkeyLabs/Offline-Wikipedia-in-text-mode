 "text": "The T-72 is a family of Russian/Soviet main battle tanks that started getting built in 1969. The T-72 was made to replace the T-64, which was bad because it was expensive and complicated. Around 25,000 T-72s have been built, and repairs have made many of them work for a very long time. The T-72 has been used in 40 countries. The T-72 was replaced by the T-90 in 1992, but the T-72 is still made today. Category:Military of Russia Category:Tanks",
