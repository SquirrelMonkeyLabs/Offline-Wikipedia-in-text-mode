The Holy See is a non-democratic state, governed by an absolutist and elective monarchy, headed by the Pope, based in Vatican City. The Holy Father, as sovereign of the State, ex officio accumulates legislative, executive, and judicial powers; during the period of the sede vacante, these powers are exercised by the College of Cardinals. == Election == The pope is elected in the papal conclave, composed of all the cardinal electors which are bishops and archbishops appointed by the pope, now limited to all the cardinals below the age of 80, after the death or resignation of the previous Pope. ==Administration of Vatican City== | Sovereign || Leo XIV || || 8 May 2025 |- | President of the Governorate || Raffaella Petrini || || 1 March 2025 |} As with almost all monarchies, the executive, legislative and judicial power of government reside in the crown, in this case in the office of the Bishop of Rome (the pope).
