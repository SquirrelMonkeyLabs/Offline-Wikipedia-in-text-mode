 "text": "Ya Hussain is a Arabic phrase used by followers of Shiism to ask for help or remember Husayn ibn Ali (who is the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad). The phrase is used commonly in the Mourning of Muharram. The British in the British Raj heard Shiites chanting \"Ya Hussain! (O Hussain!) Ya Hassan! (O Hassan!) during the Mourning of Muharram, and made a similar term called \"Hobson-Jobson\", which became a term referring to the similarities on how a English word and a foreign-language word were derived from by adapting English words or names that sound similar.Yule & Burnell, 419 == References == == Related pages == * Descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib * Day of Ashura * Day of Tasu'a * Sermon of Ali ibn Husayn in Damascus * Ziyarat Ashura Category:Shia Islam Category:Islamic terminology Category:Arabic words and phrases",
