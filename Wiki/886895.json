 "text": "Frederick III (; 18 October 183115 June 1888) was German Emperor and King of Prussia for 99 days from March to June 1888. The only son of Kaiser Wilhelm I, he was Crown Prince of Prussia for twenty-seven years and Crown Prince of the German Empire for seventeen years. He was also the father of Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor. In 1858, Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria. They both had liberal views, despite his family's conservative and militaristic background. They had eight children together named Wilhelm, Charlotte, Henry, Sigismund, Viktoria, Waldemar, Sophia, and Margaret. After his father's death on March 9, 1888, Frederick became the German Emperor and King of Prussia. During the short time that he was the emperor, Frederick wanted to bring liberal reforms and turn Germany into a limited constitutional monarchy. However, he was already suffering from throat cancer. That made it very hard to fulfill his duties. He lost his voice completely. He was unable to make these changes as his illness became worse. Frederick died on June 15, 1888, 99 days after becoming emperor. He was succeeded by his eldest son Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor. ==Notes== == References == Category:1831 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in Germany Category:Crown princes and princesses of Prussia Category:Deaths from throat cancer Category:German emperors Category:House of Hohenzollern Category:Kings and Queens of Prussia Category:People from Potsdam Category:19th-century German people Category:19th-century monarchs in Europe",
