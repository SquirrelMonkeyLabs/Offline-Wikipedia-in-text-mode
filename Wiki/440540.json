His name Kango was originally Kaongo, that is to say the field that surrounds a palace or a concession. Founder of the MRV (Voltaic regroupment movement), he was deputy of Upper Volta under the Fourth Republic, in the first National Assembly of the Fifth Republic. He was ambassador of the new independent state of Upper Volta in Great Britain from 1960 to 1966. Subsequently, he continued to play an important role in the political life of the country, notably by sitting in the National Assembly for the constituency of Ouahigouya and being one of the leaders of the UDV / RDA (Democratic Union Voltaic, member of the African Democratic Rally). He was Prime Minister of Upper Volta from 1971 to 1974, under the presidency of Aboubacar Sangoulé Lamizana. President of the National Assembly during the coup d'état of Saye Zerbo on November 25, 1980, he was imprisoned several times under the dictatorships of Saye Zerbo, Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaore. Since the easing of the regime presided over by the latter head of state in the early 1990s, he was elected twice as MP under the Fourth Republic, before resigning on May 27, 1998. Shortly thereafter, the African Democratic Rally appointed honorary president for life. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Prime ministers of Burkina Faso",
