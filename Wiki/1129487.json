 "text": "Wisconsin Telephone Company (the corporate name before 1984; Wisconsin Bell 1984 and after) is the Regional Bell Operating Company in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It does business as AT&T; Inc. Previous owners were the original AT&T;, Ameritech (1984 to 1999), and SBC Communications (1999 to 2005 or 2006). In late 1993, Ameritech removed all the state Bell names from corporate status. Ameritech became the corporate name. However, the state names were later revived through SBC Communications or AT&T; in the 2000s. Wisconsin Bell and the four others, Indiana Bell, Michigan Bell, Ohio Bell and Illinois Bell Telephone Companies now do business as the \"new\" AT&T.; The AT&T; Center headquarters are in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ==References== Category:American telephone companies Category:Companies based in Wisconsin",
