After capturing these forts, Aurangzeb deployed Sarja Khan, a seasoned general, to the Deccan. In December 1687, the Marathas, led by Hambirrao Mohite, defeated the Mughals at the Battle of Wai, though Mohite was killed. Following the battle, Sambhaji's forces weakened, and his movements were betrayed by Soyarabai and the Shirkes to the Mughals. Sambhaji was eventually caught by Mughal commander Muqarrab Khan supported by Ganoji Shirke after a defeat at Samgamneshwar on 1 February 1689. He was captured along with his minister Kavi Kalash and 25 officers. Aurangzeb, pleased with the capture, renamed Akluj to Asadnagar. ==Aftermath== Kavi Kalash and Sambhaji, captured by the Mughals, were humiliated and paraded through the Mughal camps before being presented to Aurangzeb. He offered to spare Sambhajiâ€™s life if he surrendered his forts, disclosed his treasuries, and revealed Mughal officers aiding the Marathas, even offering him conversion to Islam. However, Sambhaji insulted Aurangzeb and Muhammad, leading the Ulema to sentence him to death.Then he was tortured, blinded with red-hot irons, and beheaded on 11 March 1689 at Koregaon marking the end of resistance in the region. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:History of India",
