 "text": "McDonald's Corporation, doing business as McDonald's, is an American multinational fast food chain, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. The brothers' business, which started off as a hamburger stand, soon became the company franchise as it is today. The Golden Arches is now the company's logo, which was introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and, in 1961, bought out the McDonald brothers. Previously headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, it moved to nearby Chicago in June 2018. McDonald's is also a real estate company through its ownership of around 70% of restaurant buildings and 45% of the underlying land (which it leases to its franchisees). McDonald's has over 40,000 international restaurant locations as of 2024 and 13,622 in the United States as of 2025. The restaurants serve in total over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries. McDonald's is the world's second- largest fast food restaurant chain by number of locations, surpassed only by Chinese chain Mixue Ice Cream & Tea as of September 2024. McDonald's primary offerings are hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and french fries. Other items on their menu include chicken, fish, fruit, and salads. Their bestselling licensed item is their french fries, followed by the Big Mac. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. In 2018, McDonald's was the world's second-largest private employer with 1.7 million employees (behind only Walmart with 2.3 million employees), the majority of whom work in the restaurant's franchises. McDonald's has been subject to criticism of its effects on the world, like obesity, low worker wages, and negative impacts on the environment. ==Notes== == References == == Other websites == * Official announcement * Google Chrome OS - FAQ * Google Chrome Blog * Chrome OS Could Offend the Open Source Community PC World (Friday, July 10, 2009) Chrome OS",
