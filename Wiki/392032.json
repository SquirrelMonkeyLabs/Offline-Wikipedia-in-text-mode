 "text": "A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field. It is known as the largest and the most powerful type of magnet existing in the Universe. It has the most powerful magnetic field at 1015 gauss. The theory regarding these objects was proposed by Robert Duncan and Christopher Thompson in 1992, but the first recorded gamma ray burst thought to have been from a magnetar had been detected on March 5, 1979. Magnetars were previously named as Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs).
