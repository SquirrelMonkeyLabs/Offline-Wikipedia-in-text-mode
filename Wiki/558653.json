 "text": "I Zwicky 36 (often shortened to I Zw 36) is a blue compact dwarf galaxy, meaning that it is small for a galaxy, that its stars are close together and that it gives off blue light. The stars in I Zwicky 36 are young for stars, no older than three million years.«To messy star factory». == Recent observations == Astronomers studied I Zw 36 (≈Z⊙/14) using the Hubble Space Telescope. Before that, they took pictures using ultraviolet light using the pre-COST Faint Object Camera (FOC) and Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). FOC seemed to show that I Zw 36 had large, hot stars but NICMOS said it had cold stars that were small or medium sized. Some evidence shows the stars were active and then the galaxy became compact and blue. The evidence of luminous and asymptotic branches of stars suggests they formed several million years ago. The giant red branches of the galaxy may have at least 1-2 billion years.«To Near-Infrared Stellar Census of Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies: The Wolf-Rayet Galaxy I Zw 36». ==Related pages== * Dwarf galaxy == References == ==Other websites== * SIMBAD Astronomical Dabatase Results for Mrk 209 Category:Dwarf galaxies",
