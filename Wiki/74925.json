 "text": "The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is a cricket and Australian Rules Football stadium in Melbourne, Australia. It has a capacity of 100,000. It was used as the main stadium for the 1956 Summer Olympics. The Melbourne Cricket Club started to use the area for cricket in 1853. Their old ground, now Southbank, was often flooded by the Yarra River, and was also in the way of a new railway line. In 1859, the first game of Australian Rules Football was played at the ground. The MCG is run by a trust. The first chairman of the trust was the first Premier of Victoria, William Haines. ==References== Category:Cricket in Australia Category:Australian Football League Category:Sports buildings in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Melbourne Category:1853 establishments in Oceania Category:1850s establishments in Australia Category:Olympic venues Category:Sport in Victoria, Australia Category:Cricket grounds",
