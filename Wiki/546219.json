 "text": "Brexit () was a movement that promoted that the United Kingdom (UK) leave the European Union (EU). The name \"Brexit\" is a portmanteau of \"British\" and \"exit\". On 23 June 2016, the UK made a referendum that asked whether the UK should leave the EU. The result was that 51.9% of the UK electorate (the main region of the UK) voted that the UK should leave the EU. The rest wanted the UK to stay in the EU. On 29 March 2017, the UK government said that they will definitely be leaving the EU. This started the procedure of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, a law that deals with countries that leave the EU. The UK was expected to fully leave the EU on 29 March 2019 at 11p.m. UTC. The deadline to leave was later changed to 31 October 2019. On 15 January 2019, Theresa May's government was defeated in the House of Commons by 230 votes in a vote on her deal to leave the European Union. On 24 December 2020, a post- Brexit trade deal was made. ==Timeline== Below is a timeline of major events relating to Brexit.See also === 2014 === * 22 May: 2014 European election: Anti-EU party UKIP led by Nigel Farage comes first, while pro-EU parties suffer. ===2016=== ===2017=== * 24 January: The Parliament must pass legislation (approve of this rule) before Article 50 can be accepted as a law.
