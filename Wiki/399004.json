 "text": "Lennington \"Len\" Small (June 16, 1862 - May 17, 1936) was an American politician. He served as the 26th Governor of Illinois, from 1921 to 1929. He also served as a member of the Illinois state senate from the 16th District from 1901 to 1903 and was Illinois state treasurer, from 1905 to 1907, and from 1917 to 1919. Small was born on June 16, 1862 in Kankakee County, Illinois. He studied at Valparaiso University. Small was indicted in office for corruption. He was acquitted; thereafter, eight of the jurors received state jobs. Among his defense lawyers was former governor Joseph W. Fifer, who asserted, in pre-trial hearings, that the governorship has the divine right of kings. Small died on May 17, 1936 in Springfield, Illinois from heart failure, aged 73. ==References== ==Other websites== * Find A Grave * National Governors Association * The Political Graveyard * Genealogy Trails * Illinois State Archives Category:1862 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Governors of Illinois Category:Members of the Illinois General Assembly Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians",
