 "text": "The Ford Crown Victoria was a large, rear-wheel drive car. It was the last big, V8, RWD sedan made by an American automobile company. In the 1980s, it was called the LTD Crown Victoria. Back then, it also came as a station wagon called the Country Squire. It was redesigned in early 1991 for the 1992 model year when it became the Crown Victoria and saw the station wagon axed due to falling demand. It was redesigned for the 1998 model year. It has been widely used by both the general public as well as large businesses, government and law enforcement bodies. In 2008 Ford made the Crown Victoria \"fleet-only\", meaning they would no longer sell them one by one to the general public but could be obtained as used models. They are most commonly seen as police cars and taxis. The Crown Victoria also has the distinction of being the last car Ford sold with an analogue odometer when it was updated for the 2006 model year. It was discontinued after the 2011 model year without a direct replacement. ==Related pages== *Chevrolet Caprice ==Other websites== *Ford Crown Victoria Virtual Showroom Crown Victoria",
