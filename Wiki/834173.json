 "text": "The acre tree frog (Dendropsophus frosti) is a frog that lives in South America. Scientists have seen it in two places, one in Colombia and one in Peru. The adult male frog is 21.1 to 23.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 25.9 to 28.8 mm long. It has large eyes and vomerine teeth in its jaw. This frog can change color. During the day, it is light brown in color on the back and darker on the sides. It is yellow or white on the belly. At night, the male frog is yellow and the female frog is brown. The female frog lays eggs on firm surfaces, such as the sides of tree trunks. This species is named after herpetologist Darrel Frost. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
