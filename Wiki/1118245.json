 "text": "Area code 321 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan. It covers the central east coast of Florida, including cities like Orlando, Melbourne, and Titusville. Area code 321 entered service on November 1, 1999 as an overlay of 407 to accommodate the increasing demand for phone numbers in the region. The split was implemented to manage the growing population and telecommunications needs specifically in the Space Coast area, known for its aerospace industry and tourism. This code is also a reference to the countdown sequence of spacecrafts, most of which have taken place in Cape Canaveral. ==References== 321",
