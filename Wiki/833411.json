 "text": "Afro-Italians are people who are from the country of Italy and who have ancestors who are African. From 1850 to 1880, more than 1,500 African babies were brought to Italy by “The Slave Masters of God,” a religious group that believed it was their duty to buy slaves and educate them in Italy. A century later, between 1980 and 1990, two million Africans immigrated to Italy. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Europe",
