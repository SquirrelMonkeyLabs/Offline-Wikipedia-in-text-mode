 "text": "The European Chemicals Agency is part of the European Union which manages the European Union regulation called Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). It started work in 2007. It is based in Helsinki. On its website there is a public summary of all the information it holds on the chemicals registered in its database. It provides this information in the form of a Substance Infocard giving hazards, uses and production or import quantities. There is information on over 245,000 chemicals, although most do not have full details since they are used in amounts below one tonne per year. == References == Category:Agencies of the European Union",
