 "text": "Front Back The Great Seal of United States is the official coat of arms of the United States. It is placed in official documents from the United States Government. The name is used both for the coat of arms, and the material seal itself, which is made by the United States' executive power. The design was submitted and accepted on June 20th, 1782. The seal's design is used in national documents, such as passports, by the United States military, and flags. As a coat of arms, it has the national colors of the United States, but the material seal itself only has a basic black and white design (like when used on paper). Since 1935, the two faces of the Great Seal appear in on the one dollar banknote. == Other websites == * Vectorial logo the Great Seal to download & print * The Great Seal * downloadable PDF booklet from U.S. State Department * Original Copy of the Great Seal Category:Symbols of the United States United States United States",
