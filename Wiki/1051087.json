He currently wrestles for All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he competes under the ring name Maxwell Jacob Friedman and his initials MJF. He is the current holder of the AEW Dynamite Diamond Ring. Friedman has also competed in Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) and Major League Wrestling (MLW). In AEW, he is a one-time AEW World Champion, a one-time International Champion (he renamed the title to AEW American Championship), a four-time holder of the Dynamite Diamond Ring, and the winner of the 2022 Casino Ladder Match. ==Career== ===All Elite Wrestling=== On January 7, 2019, Friedman signed a five-year contract with All Elite Wrestling (AEW). MJF made his AEW in-ring debut at Double or Nothing on May 25, 2019 in a pre-show Casino Battle Royale. He made it to the end before being eliminated by \"Hangman\" Adam Page. On the October 2, 2019 episode of Dynamite, MJF ran to the ring with a chair to save his friend Cody from a beatdown by The Inner Circle. At Full Gear, MJF turned heel after hitting Cody in the groin. At All Out, MJF made his return after a long time away. He wore a mask and was called \"The Joker\". He won the Casino Ladder match earlier in the night and showed up on the entrance ramp, took off his mask and stared down AEW World Champion CM Punk. On Full Gear, Friedman defeated Jon Moxley to become the youngest AEW World Champion. He won after William Regal turned on Moxley and gave Friedman his brass knuckles, which MJF used to hit Moxley. On the November 30 episode of Dynamite, MJF turned on Regal, attacking him and sending him to the hospital. MJF also threw the Championship in the garbage before revealing his own custom Burberry check pattern AEW World Championship. In July 2023, MJF and Adam Cole won a tournament to get an AEW World Tag Team Championship match. On the July 29 episode of Collision, MJF turned face for the first time when he embraced Cole after losing their title match against FTR. At All In: Zero Hour on August 27, MJF and Cole defeated Aussie Open to become the ROH World Tag Team Champions. On the December 27 episode of Dynamite: New Year's Smash, MJF lost the ROH World Tag Team Championships in a 2-on-1 Handicap match to the The Devil's Masked Men. Samoa Joe was supposed to team with MJF to defend the title in place of the injured Adam Cole but he would be attacked by The Devil's Masked Men before the match. This turned out to be a fakeout and Joe would attack MJF after the match. At Worlds End, MJF lost the AEW World title to Samoa Joe. After the match, the lights would go out and come back on. When the lights came on, a returning Adam Cole was seated in the ring with four masked men. The men would pull off their masks and reveal themselves to be The Kingdom (Matt Taven & Mike Bennett), Roderick Strong, and Wardlow. They would attack MJF after his match and Cole pulled The Devil mask out of his jacket revealing himself to be The Devil and betraying MJF. After the event, MJF took some time off because of injuries. ==== American Champion (2024–present) ==== At Double or Nothing on May 26, 2024, MJF returned by attacking Adam Cole. On the Beach Break special episode of Dynamite, MJF turned heel again when he cost Daniel Garcia the AEW International Championship and attacked him. On the July 17 episode of Dynamite, MJF defeated Will Ospreay and won the International Championship for the first time. On the July 24 episode of Dynamite, MJF renamed the International Championship to the AEW American Championship and presented a brand new belt design that featured the colors of the American flag. ==Championships== *AAW Wrestling **AAW Heritage Championship (1 time) *All Elite Wrestling **AEW World Championship (1 time) **AEW International/American Championship (1 time) **Dynamite Diamond Ring (2019–2022) **Casino Ladder Match (2022) **Blind Eliminator Tag Team Tournament (2023) (with Adam Cole) **Dynamite Award (1 time) ***Best Mic Duel (2022) (MJF and CM Punk on Thanksgiving Eve) *Alpha-1 Wrestling **A1 Outer Limits Championship (1 time) *CBS Sports **Rookie of the Year (2019) *Combat Zone Wrestling **CZW Wired Championship (1 time) **CZW World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Dramatic Dream Team **Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship (1 time) *ESPN **Promo artist of the year (2022) ** #1 of the 30 best Pro Wrestlers Under 30. *Inspire Pro Wrestling **Inspire Pro Wrestling Pure Prestige Championship (1 time) *LDN Wrestling **LDN Capital Wrestling Championship (2 times) *Limitless Wrestling **Limitless Wrestling World Championship (1 time) *Major League Wrestling **MLW World Middleweight Championship (1 time) **MLW World Tag Team Championship (1 time) (with Richard Holliday) *Maryland Championship Wrestling **MCW Rage Television Championship (1 time) *New York Post ** Promo of the Year (2022) (\"Pipebomb\" promo) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** #6 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 (2023) ** Feud of the Year (2021) (vs. Chris Jericho) ** Feud of the Year (2022) (vs. CM Punk) ** Most Hated Wrestler of the Year (2021, 2022) ** Faction of the Year (2021) (with The Inner Circle) *Ring of Honor **ROH World Tag Team Championship (1 time) (with Adam Cole) *Rockstar Pro Wrestling **American Luchacore Championship (1 time) **Rockstar Pro Trios Championship (1 time) (with Ace Romero and Clayton Jackson) *The New York Times **Best Performance (2020) (for his rendition of \"Me and My Shadow\" with Chris Jericho) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter **Best on Interviews (2021, 2022) **Most Charismatic (2020, 2022) *WrestlePro **WrestlePro Tag Team Championship (1 time) (with Valerio Lamorte) *Xcite Wrestling **Xcite International Championship (1 time) == References == ==Other websites== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:All Elite Wrestling people Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Jewish sportspeople Category:Sportspeople from New York (state)",
