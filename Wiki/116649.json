 "text": "Aránzazu (Arantxa) Isabel Maria Sanchez VicarioVicario is not her married name. It is her mother's maiden name. In the Spanish naming system, every person has two surnames: the first one comes from the father, the second from the mother. A woman therefore never changes surnames, regardless of whether she marries or divorces. When she started her professional career, she was known as Sanchez but later requested that her mother's maiden name be added. Her two brothers, Emilio and Javier, were also known as Sanchez Vicario in the Spanish-speaking world. (born 18 December 1971, in Barcelona, Spain) is a retired Spanish professional tennis player. During her career, she won 4 Grand Slam singles titles and 6 Grand Slam doubles titles. At the 1990 US Open, a reporter asked Sánchez Vicario what she kept in her oversized Reebok sports bag that she was carrying around the grounds at Flushing Meadows. She explained that in addition to a half-dozen racquets, extra sets of strings, grips, socks, clothing, and assorted fruit, that she often carried her Pomeranian dog in the bag. It was good luck, she said, explaining how her dog traveled the globe with her. == References == Category:1971 births Category:Female tennis players Category:French Open champions Category:Living people Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Barcelona Category:Spanish tennis players Category:US Open (tennis) champions Category:Wimbledon champions Category:World No. 1 tennis players",
