 "text": "A durian is a big fruit with a strong smell that smells like flowers and a hard shell with soft thorns. Its flavour is loved by some people, especially in Southeast Asia, where people name it \"King of Fruits\". Many hotels and public transportation systems do not let people carry durians because of the strong smell, which many people find unpleasant. There are many different kinds of durian that are priced differently due to the people's preferences. == Appearance == The fruit can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and usually weighs one to three kg (2 to 7 lb). Durian is a tropical fruit. It grows only in humid, hot places. The flesh is used for many dishes in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked. ==References== Category:Tropical fruit Category:Malvaceae Category:National symbols of Indonesia",
