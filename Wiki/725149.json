 "text": "Jamie Richard Vardy (born 11 January 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays for Leicester City as a striker. He is one of the most successful strikers in Premier League. Vardy won the Premier League title with Leicester in 2016. He has played for the England national team, but has retired from international play to protect his body from wear and tear. His club contract is by far his main source of income. Vardy is very unusual, because he was a third division player who made it big when transferred to a Premier League club quite late in his career. He started his footballing career at the age of sixteen, playing for Stockbridge Park Steels youth system. On his debut for Halifax Town in 2010, Vardy scored the winning goal against Buxton. He was their top scorer for the season, with 25 goals in 37 appearances. After leaving Halifax for Fleetwood Town, he became the season's top scorer with 31 league goals. In May 2012, Vardy signed for Championship side Leicester City. In 2013-14 season, Vardy got the Leicester's player of the season award, with 16 league goals. The following season, Leicester was promoted to the Premier League. Vardy won his first Premier League Player of the Month award for the month of October in 2015 and won it again in November. The sports' highlight of the year was when Leicester won the 2015-16 season of the Premier League, one season after promotion. Vardy won the Premier League Player of the Season award and was one of the four Leicester players selected in the PFA Team of the Year. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 22 February 2017. He is the only player in Premier league history to have scored goals in 11 consecutive (one after the other) matches. On 5 July, 2020, Vardy scored 2 goals against Crystal Palace to complete a century of goals in Premier League. ==International career== Vardy was selected for the England squad for UEFA Euro 2016. He made his international debut for England on 7th June, coming as a substitute for Wayne Rooney against the Republic of Ireland. He scored his first goal for England against Germany on 26 March 2016. He was also selected in England's squad for the World Cup 2018. On 28 August 2018, Vardy \"stepped aside\" from the England national team. He told manager Gareth Southgate that he did not want to be considered for selection unless there was an injury crisis. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League League League FA Cup FA Cup League Cup League Cup Europe Europe Other Other Total Total Club Season Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals FC Halifax Town 2010–11 NPL Premier Division 33 23 3 1 — — — — 1 1 37 25 FC Halifax Town 2011–12 Conference North 4 3 — — — — — — — — 4 3 FC Halifax Town Total Total 37 26 3 1 — — — — 1 1 41 28 Fleetwood Town 2011–12 Conference Premier 36 31 6 3 — — — — 0 0 42 34 Leicester City 2012–13 Championship 26 4 2 0 1 1 — — 0 0 29 5 Leicester City 2013–14 Championship 37 16 1 0 3 0 — — — — 41 16 Leicester City Total Total 99 51 9 3 4 1 — — 0 0 112 55 Leicester City 2014–15 Premier League 34 5 2 0 0 0 — — — — 36 5 Leicester City 2015–16 Premier League 36 24 1 0 1 0 — — — — 38 24 Leicester City 2016–17 Premier League 35 13 2 0 1 0 9 2 1 1 48 16 Leicester City 2017–18 Premier League 37 20 3 2 2 1 — — — — 42 23 Leicester City 2018–19 Premier League 34 18 0 0 2 0 — — — — 36 18 Leicester City 2019–20 Premier League 35 23 1 0 4 0 — — — — 40 23 Leicester City 2020-21 Premier League 34 15 4 0 0 0 4 2 — — 42 17 Leicester City Total Total 245 118 13 2 10 1 13 4 1 1 282 126 Career total Career total Career total 381 195 25 6 14 2 13 4 2 2 435 209 ===International=== Source: Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals England 2015 4 0 England 2016 10 5 England 2017 5 1 England 2018 7 1 Total Total 26 7 ===International goals=== :As of match played 11 July 2018.

Vardy is one of three L.C. players who have been nominated for the Ballon d'Or (the others were Gordon Banks and Riyad Mahrez). ==References== ==Other websites== *Profile at the Leicester City F.C. website Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:2018 FIFA World Cup players Category:English footballers Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Sportspeople from Sheffield Category:UEFA Euro 2016 players",
