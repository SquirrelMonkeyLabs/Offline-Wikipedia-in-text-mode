It lives in Patagonia, which is in Chile and Argentina.. ==Body== The adult male frog is 32.47 - 38.77 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 26.22 - 38.42 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is bright green in color with brown or reddish warts. There are dark band stripes on the tops of the back legs. Younger frogs have more warts and brighter colors than adult frogs. The bottoms of the legs are brown and partly clear. There is a dark brown band strope from the nose to the ear. There is a dark mark under the eye to the mouth. The iris of the eye is orange in color with gold spots and a dark line under the pupil. The pupil of the eye is shaped like a diamond. ==Home== People find this frog in forests, sometimes forests with bogs in them. Scientists saw this frog as high as 942 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in one protected place: Laguna Caiquenes Protected Area in Chile. ==Reproduction== The female frog lays her eggs on branches or rocks just under the water in ponds. She lays 14-30 eggs at a time. The animals are tadpoles for about 10-12 weeks. The tadpoles' skin is clear. Their bodies are brown with gold spots. Their eyes are gold with black spots. The tadpoles swim and grow in streams, ponds that stay all year, and ponds that dry up for part of the year. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Because human beings do not go to the frog's home, they do not make too many changes to the places where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
