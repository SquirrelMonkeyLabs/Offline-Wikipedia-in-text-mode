 "text": "Elsagate is a neologism referring to a controversy about videos posted on YouTube and YouTube Kids. The videos were titled family friendly, but contained inappropriate themes such as graphic violence, sexual content, fetishes, vulgar language, drugs, alcohol, injections, diseases, crude humour and dangerous activities. The videos showed characters from family-oriented media, mostly used without any legal permission, thus having no restrictions to the characters' usage limits. The term was created through a mix between Disney's Elsa character, frequently featured in the videos, and the suffix \"-gate\", used for scandals. A few channels, such as Toy Freaks, featured real children for videos, raising concern from the public about the chance of child abuse being involved. However, modern Elsagate (often dubbed Elsagate 2.0) has reterned. In early 2025, the youtuber under the name “cute cat ai” was terminated due to gory and violent material. However, copies/knock-offs of cute cat ai have been created. == References == Category:Internet culture",
