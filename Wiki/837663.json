 "text": "GISAID is open-access to genetic data of influenza viruses, and the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were made available on GISAID. This enabled global responses to the pandemic. There was the first vaccines, and diagnostic tests, to detect SARS-CoV-2. GISAID helps watch for the emergence of new COVID-19 viral strains across the planet. Its establishment was an alternative to sharing avian influenza data by conventional public-domain archives. GISAID has given rapid exchange of outbreak data during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the H7N9 epidemic in 2013, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. GISAID was recognized for its importance to world health by G20 health ministers in 2017, and in 2020 the World Health Organization chief scientist called the data-science initiative \"a game changer\". == Related pages == * Avian influenza * Cystic fibrosis * HIV Drug Resistance Database == References == Category:Databases Category:Genetics",
