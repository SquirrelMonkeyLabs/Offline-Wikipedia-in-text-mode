In 2018, the seven countries represented 58% of the global net wealth ($317 trillion)Research Institute – Global Wealth Databook 2018 and more than 46% of the global gross domestic product (GDP). The European Union is an invitee to G7. ==History== The group began in the early 1970s. The number of members has changed over time. Representatives from four leading economies first met in 1973. The representatives were finance ministers from France, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany. Later that year, the four members agreed to invite Japan to attend. These five came to be known as the \"Group of Five\". In 1975, Italy was invited to attend the first heads-of-government summit, forming the \"Group of Six\", or G6. Canada joined in 1976, making the G7. The group meets every year, with a different host and president each year. The president of the European Council has attended since 1977. Since 1987, the finane ministers of G7 countries have met at least twice a year at separate meetings. In some years they have met four times. From 1995, Russia attended informally, and they joined the group in 1998, creating the G8. On 2 March 2014, the other members of the G8 criticized the \"Russian Federation's violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\" As a result, Russia was removed from the G8 which was later renamed G7 as there are now seven leaders in the group. ==Country leaders and EU representatives (as of 2025)== File:Mark Carney portrait May 2025 (4).jpg| Mark Carney, Prime Minister|alt=CanadaMarkCarney,Prime Minister File:President Emmanuel Macron in May 2025.jpg| Emmanuel Macron, President|alt=FranceEmmanuel Macron,President File:2024-08-21 Event, CDU, Wahlkampf mit Friedrich Merz in Erfurt 2024 STP 3041 by Stepro (cropped).jpg| Friedrich Merz, Chancellor|alt=GermanyFriedrich Merz,Chancellor File:Giorgia Meloni Official 2023 crop.jpg| Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister|alt=ItalyGiorgia Meloni,Prime Minister File:Ishiba Shigeru 20241001 (cropped).jpg| Shigeru Ishiba, Prime Minister|alt=JapanShigeru Ishiba,Prime Minister File:Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer Official Portrait (cropped).jpg| Keir Starmer, Prime Minister|alt=United KingdomRishi Sunak,Prime Minister File:TrumpPortrait.jpg| Donald Trump, President|alt=United States Donald Trump,President File:Antonio Costa Portrait 2024 (cropped).jpg| António Costa, President of the European Council|alt=European UnionCharles Michel,President of the European Council File:Official Portrait of Ursula von der Leyen (cropped).jpg| Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission|alt=European UnionUrsula von der Leyen,President of the European Commission ==Wealth data== Member Trade mil.
