It was addressed to a very early pre-Sargonic king of Ur by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad. The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad, introduced the Akkadian language, i.e. the \"language of Akkad\", as a written language. It used Sumerian cuneiform orthography (writing method) for the purpose. During the middle Bronze Age (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language displaced Sumerian. Sumerian probably became extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC. ==Evolution== Akkadian is divided into several varieties based on geography and historical period: *Old Akkadian, 2500–1950 BC *Old Babylonian/Old Assyrian, 1950–1530 BC *Middle Babylonian/Middle Assyrian, 1530–1000 BC *Neo- Babylonian/Neo-Assyrian, 1000–600 BC *Late Babylonian, 600 BC–100 AD ==References== Category:Asia Category:West Asia Category:Mesopotamia Category:Extinct languages Category:History of Asia Category:Semitic languages",
