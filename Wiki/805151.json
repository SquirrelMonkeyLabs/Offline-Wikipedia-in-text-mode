 "text": "The murder of Seth Rich happened on Sunday, July 10, 2016, at 4:20 a.m. in Washington, D.C. Rich died about an hour and a half after receiving two gunshot wounds to the back. He was murdered by unknown people for unknown reasons, but police suspected he had been the victim of an attempted robbery. The 27-year-old Rich worked for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and his murder caused many right-wing conspiracy theories, including the false claim that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post wrote that the promotion of these conspiracy theories was an example of fake news. ==References== Category:2016 in the United States Category:Conspiracy theories Category:2016 murders in the United States Rich, Seth",
