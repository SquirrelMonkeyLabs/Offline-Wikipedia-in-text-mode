The first unofficial national tournament was played in 1880, in the Café de la Régence, where further events were held in 1881 and 1883. The 1903 and 1914 tournaments were the first real predecessors of the official championship. They ran under the name Championnat de France des amateurs (Championship of the chess enthusiasts). == References == == Other websites == * Héritage des Echecs Français * Championnat de France Category:Chess competitions Category:Sport in France",
