 "text": "McDiarmid's rocket frog (Allobates mcdiarmidi) is a frog. It lives in Bolivia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in the Yungas forest. This forest is in the Cochabamba and La Paz Districts in Bolivia. Scientists saw the frog about 1693 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in some protected parks: Reserva de Biosfera y Tierra Comunitaria de Origen Pil√≥n Lajas and Parque Nacional Carrasco. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Many of them died at the same time, even in places that human beings had not changed. Scientists think there are no more than 249 adult frogs alive now. Scientists think that the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis got into the frogs and gave them the disease chytridiomycosis and then killed them, but they are not sure. Human beings also cut down many trees where the frog lives, build roads, and put bad chemicals in the air and water. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
