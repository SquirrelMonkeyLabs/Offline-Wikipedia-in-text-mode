The group joined the Army of Conquest on the 24th of March 2015, and fought in the Second Battle of Idlib losing 14 of its men in the battle. == Allegations of the usage of child soldiers == In October 2016, it was claimed that Jaysh al- Sunnah released a video with child soldiers in a unknown training camp. There were also allegations of a Saudi cleric called Abdullah al-Muhesini being linked to getting children to join militant groups and has been claimed to give a $100 dollar monthly salary to at most 1000 children in Syria. == References == Category:Militant groups Category:Islamist militant groups",
