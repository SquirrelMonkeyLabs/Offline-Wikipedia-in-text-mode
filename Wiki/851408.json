 "text": "Hazelnut butter is a type of nut butter. It is made by grinding raw or roasted hazelnuts. It is more common in Europe. Hazelnut butter can be crunchy or smooth. Hazelnut butter is high in natural fats, but the oil can separate easily, so it should be stirred before use. It should also be refrigerated after opening to slow re-separation and spoilage. Hazelnut butter can be a good alternative to peanut butter for those with peanut allergies or those who avoid legumes. ==References== Category:Nut butters",
