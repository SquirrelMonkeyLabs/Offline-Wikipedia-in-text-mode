The family members have held hereditary titles such as Baron of Teynham, Baron Dacre of Glanton, and Viscount of Baltinglass. Thomas Roper is the first member of the Viscount Baltinglass. He is well remembered for being a soldier and peer. He served as a member of the English Royal Army during the rule of James I. His Knighthood occurred on 16th September 1603. He became the key leaser of \"Herbert Estates\" after ascending to the Monastery in the year 1626 and becoming the Viscount Baltinglass in the year 1627.The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct, or Dormant (1910), Cokayne, George Edward (main author) and Vicary Gibbs (added author), (New edition. 13 volumes in 14. London: St. Catherine Press,1910-), vol. 1 p. 397 In England, Baron Dacre became a British title after its first creation in the year 1321.Baron Dacre (2010), Miller, Frederic P. (main author), , vol. 1 p. 76 Lord Hugh Redwald Trevor Roper is one of the most notable titles of Baron Dacre. Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Howard-Johnston, one of the daughters of Field Marshal, was married to Lord Hugh. In the year 1979, Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister, then recommended the title of a life peer for Lord Trevor Roper. He was presented as Baron Dacre of Glanton to the lords' house in Northumberland County on 27th September 1979. British titles such as the Baron of Teynham were formed in 1616 in England, and it was presented to Sir John Roper, and his son Roper Christopher became the second holder of the title. Interestingly his daughter called Elizabeth Roper decided to marry Baron Vaux of Harrowden, who was the third holder of the title and a son of George Vaux.Ireland, William Henry \"England's Topographer: A New and Complete History of the County of Kent, Vol. 2\" pg. 704 They were blessed with a son whom they named Edward. He became the fourth holder of the Baron Vaux of Harrowden after being married to Elizabeth Howard, who was the daughter of Thomas Howard, the first holder of the title Earl of Suffolk.Fraser, pp. 124–125, 181, 199 The fact that Sir John Roper was the first nobleman to declare the Kingship of James I makes him to be remembered for the brave act which happened after he was knighted in the year 1616, although several sources indicated that he might have been knighted in the year 1587. The same day, Queen Elizabeth was able to ascend to the peerage with the title Lord Teynham. ==Notable Members== Lord William Roper is a notable member who was a representative of the house of the lords and a practicing lawyer. He also summed up as an author, philosopher and chancellor to King Henry VII Tudor.Homily at the Canonization of St. Thomas More at The Center for Thomas More Studies at the University of Dallas, 2010, citing text \"Recorded in The Tablet, June 1, 1935, pp. 694–695\" There was an existing relationship between Lord William Roper and Sir Thomas More because Thomas’s daughter Margaret More was married to William Roper. Before sir Thomas More’s death, he had a close relationship with Lord William Roper. His cause of death was an assassination done by King Henry VIII simply because he failed to convert into the Church of England. Lord William Roper was granted the opportunity to become the Dukedom by King Henry VIII, but he declined with respect to his father-in-law's death and family members. In the year 1616, Lord William Roper and his nephew, John Roper, earned knight honors for their services. Margaret More also commonly referred to as Margaret Roper and a daughter to Thomas More, is traced back to 1505 and is believed to have met her death in the year 1544. During her tenure, she earned several recognitions, such as being an English translator and author. She was one of the best-educated female learners in the 16th century with notable academic accomplishments and familial devoutness. ==History== The Roper family owns several estates around the United Kingdom, such as Candelwick, Trimdon Estates, Galway Estates, Pylewell Park, Bradford, Hyde and Charlton.
