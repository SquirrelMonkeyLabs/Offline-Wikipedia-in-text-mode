The album was made after Mother Love Bone, the band that Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were in, broke up. Gossard and Ament started making music with a guitarist named Mike McCready, and a drummer named Matt Cameron. They made a demo tape with five songs on it. The demo was given to Eddie Vedder and Dave Krusen, two other musicians. Both of them joined the band. Many of the songs on Ten were ones that the band already made. However, Vedder sang different words for them for the album. Ten was not very popular when it was released. It got more popular in 1992, when it was number two on the Billboard 200 music chart. The album had three popular singles: \"Alive\", \"Even Flow\", and \"Jeremy\". \"Jeremy\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards.
