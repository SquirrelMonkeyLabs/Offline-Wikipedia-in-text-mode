 "text": "Epaminondas George Aristotle Alexander Stassinopoulos (17 January 1921 - 16 May 2022) was a German-born Greek astrophysicist. He was the head of the Radiation Physics Office and Emeritus Astrophysicist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He was the author of many papers and articles in the field of space radiation. Stassinopoulos was born in Bonn, Germany. He turned 100 in January 2021. Stassinopoulos died on 16 May 2022 in Culver City, California at the age of 101.Epaminondas George Stassinopoulos ==Works== * Stassinopoulos, E. , Stauffer, C. , & Brucker, G. (1998).
