 "text": "Bothriolepis is a genus of antiarch placoderms. It was widespread and diverse in the middle to late Devonian. Bothriolepis lived in environments across every continent including near-shore marine and freshwater settings. Most species of Bothriolepis were small, benthic, freshwater detritivores. They got nutrients by eating decomposing plant/animal material. They were about in length. However, the largest species, B. maxima, had a carapace about in length. Over 70 species are found across the world, but this is also typical of modern bottom dwelling species around today. == References == Category:Placoderms",
