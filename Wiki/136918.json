 "text": "Procopius of Caesarea (, c. 500 – c. 565) was a prominent Eastern Roman scholar. He took part in the wars of the Emperor Justinian I, and was the major historian of the 6th century AD, writing the Wars of Justinian, the Buildings of Justinian and the celebrated Secret History. He is commonly held to be the last major historian of the ancient world. == Writings == The writings of Procopius are the primary source of information for the rule of the Roman emperor Justinian. Procopius was the author of a history in eight books of the wars fought by Justinian I, with information on Justinian's public works throughout the empire, and a book known as the Secret History (Greek: Anekdota) that claims to report the scandals that Procopius could not include in his published history. A number of historical novels based on Procopius' works (along with other sources) have been written, of which the best, Count Belisarius, was written by poet and novelist Robert Graves in 1938. == Further reading == * Greatrex, Geoffrey: Recent work on Procopius and the composition of Wars VIII; in: Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 27 (2003), 45-67. * Treadgold, Warren: The Early Byzantine Historians, Basingstoke 2007, 176-226. == List of selected works == * Procopii Caesariensis opera omnia.
