 "text": "Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) is a sub-genre of strategy video game. Gameplay in MOBAs usually involves two opposing teams, each trying to destroy the other team's base while defending their own. Players must work together to defeat computer-controlled enemy units and gain experience and gold, which can be used to purchase upgrades and items for their characters. One of the most popular MOBAs is League of Legends, which was released in 2009 and has since become one of the most played online games in the world. Other popular MOBAs include Dota 2, Smite, and Heroes of the Storm. MOBAs require a combination of strategic thinking, quick reflexes, and teamwork to succeed. Players must communicate effectively with their teammates, manage resources, and make split-second decisions in order to gain an advantage over their opponents. The rise of MOBAs has led to the development of professional esports leagues and tournaments, where teams of players compete for large cash prizes. The popularity of these events has helped to legitimize video gaming as a competitive sport and has brought gaming into the mainstream. While MOBAs are known for their fast-paced, action-packed gameplay, they can also be complex and difficult to learn. Many MOBAs have extensive tutorials and learning resources to help new players get started, but it can take months or even years to become proficient at the game. Despite the challenges, MOBAs remain one of the most popular genres in gaming, with millions of players around the world logging on to play each day. With new games and updates being released regularly, the MOBA genre shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Category:Video game genres",
