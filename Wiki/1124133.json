 "text": "A conversion path describes the steps a user takes on a website to complete a goal, like making a purchase or abandoning the site. It usually starts when a user lands on a page and moves through various pages before reaching the end goal. Marketers study this process to improve outcomes by using data and statistics. They adjust content in real time to encourage users to convert, using information like search history and demographics. For example, users might see different content based on whether they came from an ad or a search engine, and content might vary according to their demographic information. == References == Category:Marketing",
