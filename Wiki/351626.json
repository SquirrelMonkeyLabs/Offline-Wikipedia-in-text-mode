 "text": "The Boar (豬) (is the current year in 2019 symbolizing the year of the Earth Pig); is the twelfth of the 12-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac in relation to the Chinese Calendar. In the continuous sexagenary cycle, every twelfth year refers to hai, and is commonly called the Year of the Pig 豬. There are five types of Pigs, named after Chinese elements. In order, they are: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth. In the Japanese zodiac and the Tibetan zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the boar. In the Dai zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the elephant. In the Gurung zodiac, the Pig is replaced by the deer. ==Pig in Chinese zodiac== According to myths, the Pig was the last to arrive when the Jade Emperor called for the great meeting. Other sources say that the Buddha asked for a great meeting when he was about to leave Earth. The Pig came last. There are legends that as the emperor called one day, an oink and squeal was heard from a little Pig. The term \"lazy Pig\" is appropriate here as the Pig is hungry in the race, immediately stops for a feast and then falls asleep. After sleeping, the Pig continues the race and is named the 12th and final animal of the zodiac cycle.
