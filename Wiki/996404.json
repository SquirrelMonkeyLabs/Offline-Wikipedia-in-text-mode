 "text": "5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme (EC 2.7.11.31) that helps keep the body's energy balanced. It is found in many parts of the body, such as the liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. When AMP and ADP bind to it, AMPK helps the body use glucose and fatty acids for energy. It also helps stop the body from making too much cholesterol, lipogenesis, and triglycerides. AMPK is found in many different kinds of living things, from yeast to humans. It should not be confused with cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase (protein kinase A). Category:Enzymes",
