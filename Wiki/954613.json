 "text": "The Bahia heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes melanomystax) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 800 meters above sea level. This frog lives on bromeliad plants that grow on tree branches. Scientists have not seen it in bromeliad plants that grow on the ground or on small plants. In some parts of Brazil, it also lives in shrubby places. The female frog lays eggs on the leaves. When they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water in the middle of the bromeliad plants and then swims and grows in the water. This frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Although human beings cut down much of the forest where it used to live to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, there is a large forest space left as of 2023. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
