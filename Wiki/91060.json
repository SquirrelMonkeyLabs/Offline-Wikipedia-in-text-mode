 "text": "ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are three-letter country codes in the ISO 3166-1 standard to represent countries and dependent territories. They are published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as part of its ISO 3166 standard. They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974. They are used in ISO/IEC 7501-1 for machine- readable passports. ==Current codes== ===Officially assigned code elements=== Below is a complete list of the current officially assigned ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes, with country names being English short country names officially used by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA): {| style=\"background:transparent;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" `ABW` Aruba `AFG` Afghanistan `AGO` Angola `AIA` Anguilla `ALA` Åland Islands `ALB` Albania `AND` Andorra `ANT` Netherlands Antilles `ARE` United Arab Emirates `ARG` Argentina `ARM` Armenia `ASM` American Samoa `ATA` Antarctica `ATF` French Southern and Antarctic Lands `ATG` Antigua and Barbuda `AUS` Australia `AUT` Austria `AZE` Azerbaijan `BDI` Burundi `BEL` Belgium `BEN` Benin `BES` Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba `BFA` Burkina Faso `BGD` Bangladesh `BGR` Bulgaria `BHR` Bahrain `BHS` Bahamas `BIH` Bosnia and Herzegovina `BLM` Saint Barthélemy `BLR` Belarus `BLZ` Belize `BMU` Bermuda `BOL` Bolivia `BRA` Brazil `BRB` Barbados `BRN` Brunei Darussalam `BTN` Bhutan `BVT` Bouvet Island `BWA` Botswana `CAF` Central African Republic `CAN` Canada `CCK` Cocos (Keeling) Islands `CHE` Switzerland `CHL` Chile `CHN` China `CIV` Côte d'Ivoire `CMR` Cameroon `COD` Congo, the Democratic Republic of the `COG` Congo `COK` Cook Islands `COL` Colombia `COM` Comoros `CPT` Clipperton Island `CPV` Cape Verde `CRI` Costa Rica `CUB` Cuba `CXR` Christmas Island `CYM` Cayman Islands `CYP` Cyprus `CZE` Czechia `DEU` Germany `DJI` Djibouti `DMA` Dominica `DNK` Denmark `DOM` Dominican Republic `DZA` Algeria `ECU` Ecuador `EGY` Egypt `ERI` Eritrea `ESH` Western Sahara `ESP` Spain `EST` Estonia `ETH` Ethiopia `FIN` Finland `FJI` Fiji `FLK` Falkland Islands (Malvinas) `FRA` France `FRO` Faroe Islands `FSM` Micronesia, Federated States of `GAB` Gabon `GBR` United Kingdom `GEO` Georgia `GGY` Guernsey `GHA` Ghana ===User-assigned code elements=== The following alpha-3 codes can be user- assigned: from `AAA` to `AAZ`, from `QMA` to `QZZ`, from `XAA` to `XZZ`, and from `ZZA` to `ZZZ`. These code elements are at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use them in the updating process of the standard. ===Reserved code elements=== Reserved code elements are codes which, while not ISO 3166-1 codes, are in use for some applications in conjunction with the ISO 3166 codes. The ISO 3166/MA therefore reserves them, so that they are not used for new official ISO 3166 codes, thereby creating conflicts between the standard and those applications. ====Exceptional reservations==== The following alpha-3 codes are subject to an exceptional reservation: * `ASC` – Ascension Island — Reserved on request of UPU, also used by ITU * `DGA` – Diego Garcia — Reserved on request of ITU * `FXX` – France, Metropolitan — Reserved on request of France * `TAA` – Tristan da Cunha — Reserved on request of UPU The following three codes were also under exceptional reservation, until the update from 2006-03-29 included them in the standard: * `GGY` – Guernsey — Reserved on request of UPU * `IMN` – Isle of Man — Reserved on request of UPU * `JEY` – Jersey — Reserved on request of UPU ====Transitional reservations==== The following alpha-3 codes are subject to a transitional reservation: * `BUR` – Burma * `NTZ` – Neutral Zone * `SCG` – Serbia and Montenegro * `SUN` – U.S.S.R. * `TMP` – East Timor * `YUG` – Yugoslavia * `ZAR` – Zaire ====Indeterminate reservations==== The following alpha-3 codes are subject to an indeterminate reservation, having been notified to the United Nations Secretary-General under the 1949 and/or 1968 Road Traffic Conventions: * `ADN` – Aden * `BDS` – Barbados * `BRU` – Brunei * `CDN` – Canada * `EAK` – Kenya * `EAT` – Tanganyika * `EAU` – Uganda * `EAZ` – Zanzibar * `GBA` – Alderney * `GBG` – Guernsey * `GBJ` – Jersey * `GBM` – Isle of Man * `GBZ` – Gibraltar * `GCA` – Guatemala * `HKJ` – Jordan * `MAL` – Malaysia * `RCA` – Central African Republic * `RCB` – Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) * `RCH` – Chile * `RMM` – Mali * `RNR` – Northern Rhodesia * `ROK` – Republic of Korea * `RSM` – San Marino * `RSR` – Southern Rhodesia * `SLO` – Slovenia * `SME` – Suriname * `TMN` – Turkmenistan * `WAG` – Gambia * `WAL` – Sierra Leone * `ZRE` – Zaire The following code has been reassigned: * `ROU` – Uruguay — Reassigned to Romania ====Codes currently agreed not to use==== For the time being, ISO 3166/MA has agreed not to use the following codes, taken from ISO/IEC 7501-1 (machine readable travel documents), as alpha-3 country codes: * `GBD` – British Dependent Territories Citizen * `GBN` – British National (Overseas) * `GBO` – British Overseas Citizen * `GBP` – British Protected Person * `GBS` – British Subject * `UNA` – United Nations Specialized Agency Official * `UNK` – Kosovar resident, issued passport for travel document by the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo * `UNO` – United Nations Organization as the issuer and substitutes nationality when the holder is an Official of the UN Organization ==Other withdrawn codes== Besides the codes currently transitionally reserved and `FXX` (now exceptionally reserved), these alpha-3 codes have also been withdrawn since the first edition of ISO 3166 in 1974: * `AFI` – French Afar and Issas * `ATB` – British Antarctic Territory * `ATN` – Dronning Maud Land * `BYS` – Byelorussian S.S.R. — Belarus now uses `BLR` * `CSK` – Czechoslovakia * `CTE` – Canton and Enderbury Islands * `DDR` – German Democratic Republic * `DHY` – Dahomey * `GEL` – Gilbert and Ellice Islands * `HVO` – Upper Volta * `JTN` – Johnston Island * `MID` – Midway Islands * `NHB` – New Hebrides * `PCI` – Pacific Islands, Trust Territory of the * `PCZ` – Panama Canal Zone * `PHI` – Philippines — Now uses `PHL` * `PUS` – U.S. Miscellaneous Pacific Islands * `RHO` – Southern Rhodesia * `ROM` – Romania — Now uses `ROU` * `SKM` – Sikkim * `VDR` – Viet-Nam, Democratic Republic of * `WAK` – Wake Island * `YMD` – Yemen, Democratic ==Related pages== *ISO 3166 *ISO 3166-1 *ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, 2-letter country codes *ISO 3166-1 numeric, 3-digit country codes *ISO 3166-2 *ISO 3166-3 *List of IOC country codes, slightly different codes used by the International Olympic Committee *List of FIFA country codes, slightly different codes used by FIFA *Comparison of IOC, FIFA, and ISO 3166 country codes ==Sources and other websites== *International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency *United Nations Statistics Division, Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use **Countries or areas, codes and abbreviations *CIA World Factbook, Appendix D - Cross- Reference List of Country Data Codes (public domain) *Statoids, Country codes **ISO 3166-1 Change History *Country codes in ISO 3166 (outdated, include withdrawn codes) 1 alpha-3 Category:Country codes",
