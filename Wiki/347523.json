 "text": "Professor Satyendra Nath Bose laid down the basics for the Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. The boson, a kind of particle of matter, is named in his honor. He was a member of the Royal Society and was awarded India's second highest civilian award (called the Padma Vibhushan) in 1954.Singh, Rajinder 2016. Chemistry and Physics Nobel Prizes – India's contribution. Shaker Verlag, Aachen. Bose’s works helped statistical mechanics, the electromagnetic properties of the ionosphere, the theories of X-ray crystallography, and unified field theory. This work also led Einstein to work with him. Bose was interested in many subjects including physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, mineralogy, philosophy, arts, literature and music. He worked on many research and development projects for India and England. He mostly spent his life in London. == References == Category:1894 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Indian mathematicians Category:People from Kolkata Category:Theoretical physicists Category:Indian physicists",
