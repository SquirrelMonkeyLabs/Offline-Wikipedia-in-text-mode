 "text": "Hibatullah Akhundzada (; born 26 March 1957) is an Afghan politician, soldier, scholar, cleric, and jurist who is the 2nd and the current Supreme Leader of Afghanistan since 2021 and as well as the 3rd Leader of the Taliban since 2016 following a drone that strike killed his predecessor, Akhtar Mansour. Since the Fall of Kabul in August 2021, Akhundzada became Afghanistan's Supreme Leader with absolute powers over the country. In 2020, he sent Abdul Ghani Baradar to Doha to hold peace talks with the U.S. by meeting the then-U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo where they signed the US–Taliban Deal which made the U.S agree to Withdraw its Troops from Afghanistan. Akhundzada also held a phone conversation with then-U.S. President, Donald Trump the same year where they agreed to have diplomatic relationships with the two countries if Trump won the election even though it never happened as Trump lost the election. However, while announcing the talk, Trump did not mention Akhundzada's name. In July 2021, while recalling his phone conversation with Akhundzada, Trump got his name wrong referring to Akhundzada as \"Mohammed\" rather than \"Hibatullah\". Akhundzada led the Taliban to victory against the Afghan government in a 2021 military offensive—while the U.S. withdrawal was still underway—then became Afghanistan’s absolute ruler and imposed a totalitarian Islamist government. His government has been criticized for sweeping infringements on human rights, including the rights of women and girls to work and education. On his orders, the Taliban administration has prevented most teenage girls from returning to secondary school education. In July 2022, while attending a religious gathering in Kabul, Akhundzada lashed out at the demands of the international community on his government, ruling out any talks or compromise on his \"Islamic system\" of governance. ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Taliban Category:Afghan military people Category:Heads of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan Category:Dictators Category:21st-century Afghan people",
