 "text": "A group is any column on the periodic table. Elements in the same group usually have similar properties, because they have the same number of electrons in the outermost electron shell. There are eight main groups of elements, numbered 1, 2, and 13-18. The other ten groups are transition metals: *Group 1: the alkali metals (lithium family) *not including hydrogen *Group 2: the alkaline earth metals (beryllium family) *Groups 3-12: the transition metals *Group 13: the triels (boron family) *Group 14: the tetrels (carbon family) *Group 15: the pnictogens (nitrogen family) *Group 16: the chalcogens (oxygen family) *Group 17: the halogens (fluorine family) *Group 18: the noble gases (helium/neon family) == Alkali Metals == See Alkali metal The most reactive metals are Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), Cesium (Cs), and Francium (Fr) * never include hydrogen. == Alkaline Earth Metals == See Alkaline earth metal. They are Beryllium (Be), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba), Radium (Ra) == Transition groups == See Transition metals. Transition Metals are the most number of elements in the periodic table. They are Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Chromium (Cr), Cobalt (Co), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn), Mercury (Hg), Scandium (Sc), Titanium (Ti), Vanadium (V), Silver (Ag), Gold (Au), Cadmium (Cd), Tungsten (W), Platinum (Pt), Yttrium (Y), Molybdenum (Mo) and others. == The noble gases == The noble gases are the 18th group in the periodic table. They are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn). They were previously called Inert gases. Category:Periodic table",
