 "text": "Herbert Henry Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith KG PC KC (12 September 1852 – 15 February 1928) served as the Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. Until 5 January 1988, he had been the longest continuously serving Prime Minister in the 20th century.5 January 1988 was the day on which his record was surpassed by Margaret Thatcher. Winston Churchill served longer, however, in two non-consecutive terms in office He was not, however, in favour of the right of women to vote. As Prime Minister, he led the Liberal Party to a series of domestic reforms, including social insurance and the reduction of the power of the House of Lords. He led the nation into the First World War, but a series of military and political crises led to his replacement in late 1916 by David Lloyd George. His falling out with Lloyd George played a major part in the downfall of the Liberal Party. His ministry was significant for the Old Age Pension (1908), National Insurance Act (1911) and the Parliamentary Act (1911), which restricted the power of the House of Lords. Asquith's descendants include: ambassador Dominic Asquith (great- grandson), actress Helena Bonham Carter (great-granddaughter) and actress Anna Chancellor (great-great-granddaughter). == References == Category:1852 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:English King's Counsel Category:British people of World War I Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer Category:Congregationalists Category:English Protestants Category:Members of the British House of Commons for Scottish constituencies Category:Leaders of the Liberal Party (UK) Category:Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom) Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs Category:Liberal members of the House of Lords Category:Politicians from Yorkshire Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Secretaries of State for the Home Department Category:Secretaries of State of the United Kingdom Category:United Kingdom Earls Category:UK MPs 1886–1892 Category:UK MPs 1892–1895 Category:UK MPs 1895–1900 Category:UK MPs 1900–1906 Category:UK MPs 1906–1910 Category:UK MPs 1910 Category:UK MPs 1910–1918 Category:UK MPs 1918–1922 Category:UK MPs 1922–1923 Category:UK MPs 1923–1924",
