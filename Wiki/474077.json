The speech was the second State of the Union address of President Reagan's second term. Reagan was the only president to have postponed his State of the Union Address. On January 28, 1986, he planned to give his address, but after learning of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, he postponed it for a week and addressed the nation on the day's events. This was the only time that the State of the Union address had to be postponed because of an event. The speech lasted for about 31 minutes and had 3,514 words. The address was broadcast live on radio and television. The Democratic Party response was delivered by Senator George Mitchell (ME), Lt. Gov. Harriett Woods (MO), Gov. Charles Robb (VA), Rep. Thomas Daschle (SD) and Rep. William Gray (PA) ==References== ==Other websites== * (full transcript), The American Presidency Project, UC Santa Barbara. * (full video), Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia.
