 "text": "The Gualaceo rocket frog (Hyloxalus parcus) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. Scientists think this frog lives in forests on mountains where there is water in the air. People have seen this frog between 1707 and 2073 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog probably hatches out of its egg as a tadpole, but no scientist has written about having seen the tadpoles. Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out, but one of the places it lives is a protected park: Área Ecológica de Conservacíon Siete Iglesias. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
