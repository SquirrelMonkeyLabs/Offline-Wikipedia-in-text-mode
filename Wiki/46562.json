 "text": "Intimacy is linked with feelings of closeness among partners in a relationship. It is usually characterized by love and attachment. These feelings may or may not be connected or confused with sexual feelings. In other relationships, intimacy has more to do with shared moments than sexual interactions. This is not an exact definition, but it seems that intimacy and healthy relationships go hand in hand. Indeed, intimacy is basic in any meaningful relationship: the basis of friendship and one of the foundations of love. The main forms of intimacy are emotional intimacy and physical intimacy. Intellectual intimacy, familiarity with a person's culture and interests, is common among friends. Members of religious or philosophic groups may also perceive a \"spiritual intimacy\" in common. == Intimate partners == Terms for partners in various degrees of love include * Boyfriend * Girlfriend * Mistress (lover) * spouse == Related pages == * Interpersonal relationship * Marriage Category:Relationships",
