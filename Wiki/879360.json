 "text": "Pro-aging trance is a social phenomenon in which people gloss over aging and death for reasons that are often irrational. For example, they say that death is a necessary thing that gives life a meaning. The term was invented by Aubrey de Grey, a British author and gerontologist. He sees the pro-aging trance as a big barrier to combating aging. This is because the development of anti-aging medicine is delayed if there is no public support and acceptance of them. == References == Category:Gerontology",
