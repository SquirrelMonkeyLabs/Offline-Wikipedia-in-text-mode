Scott of The New York Times said \"It's rare to see so many moments of grace followed by so many stumbles and fumbles, or to see intelligence and discretion undone so thoroughly by glibness and grossness. And it is puzzling, and ultimately draining, to see a film that waves the flag of honesty—Face your demons! Speak from your heart! Open up!—turn out to be so phony.\" == Cast == * Adam Sandler as Dr. Charlie Fineman * Don Cheadle as Dr. Alan Johnson * Jada Pinkett Smith as Janeane Johnson * Liv Tyler as Dr. Angela Oakhurst * Saffron Burrows as Donna Remar * Donald Sutherland as Judge David Raines * Robert Klein as Jonathan Timpleman * Melinda Dillon as Ginger Timpleman * Mike Binder as Bryan Sugarman * Jonathan Banks as Stelter * John de Lancie as Nigel Pennington * Rae Allen as Adell Modell * Paula Newsome as Melanie * Ted Raimi as Peter Saravino * B.
