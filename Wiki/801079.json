 "text": "The 2024 United States presidential election was the 60th quadrennial presidential election. The election was held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, along with other state and federal elections. It was the first presidential election to use population information from the 2020 census. The Republican ticket of former President Donald Trump and Ohio U.S. senator JD Vance won the election. They defeated the Democratic ticket of incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. President Joe Biden initially ran for reelection to a second term and became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, but ended his campaign on July 21, 2024 after a bad debate performance, concerns about his age and health, and declining popularity. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. She picked Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz as her running mate. Had she won, she would have become the first female president in U.S. history. Harris is the second woman major party nominee to lose a U.S. presidential election after Hillary Clinton in 2016 (both lost to Trump). Harris was also the first nominee who did not participate in the primaries since Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Donald Trump, who served as president from 2017 to 2021, ran for reelection to a nonconsecutive second term. He picked Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance as his running mate. Trump is the first U.S. president to serve two nonconsecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in 1893. In 2023 and 2024, Trump was found liable and guilty in civil and criminal proceedings, becoming the first former president to be convicted of a crime. Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024. Some main campaign issues during the election cycle were abortion,For sources on this, see: * * * border security and immigration, climate change, democracy, the economy, education, foreign policy, healthcare, and LGBT rights. Trump won a decisive victory, winning 312 electoral college votes to Harris' 226. Additionally, Trump became the first Republican to win the national popular vote (majority of the vote share) since George W. Bush in 2004. Trump and Vance won the election in the early hours of November 6 as the next and 47th president and 50th vice president of the United States. Harris called Trump on November 6 to congratulate him. She delivered a concession speech later that day. Trump is the second president to be elected to a nonconsecutive second term, 132 years after Grover Cleveland won the 1892 election. Trump is also the oldest person ever elected president, at the age of 78. Harris is the most recent sitting vice president to run for the presidency and lose since Al Gore in 2000 and the most recent Democratic presidential nominee to lose the national popular vote since John Kerry in 2004. == Background == === Requirements === Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment prevents anyone from being elected president more than twice. == Campaign topics == === Abortion === The Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, allowing U.S. states to fully ban abortion for the first time in almost 50 years. This made abortion a campaign issue. The Republicans have been linked to Project 2025, which asks to completely ban abortion in the country. === Crime === Due to more mass shootings in the United States, President Biden has advocated a ban of assault weapons. This was most likely a major campaign topic in both parties. === Inflation === Republicans have blamed Democrats for the high inflation rates from 2021 to 2023. == Democratic Party == Joe Biden was the current president, elected for his first term in office in the 2020 election, and had said he planned to run for a second term in 2024. He was the oldest president, at age 78, and would've been 82 at the end of his first term and 86 at the end of a second term, if he was reelected. During late 2021, as President Biden had low approval ratings in the polls, there was speculation that he would not run for reelection. If this happened, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg would be considered likely candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, having both run for president in 2020. However, Biden said he had every intention of running for reelection. In March 2023, author and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson announced her presidential campaign, challenging Biden. In April 2023, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his challenge to Biden, becoming the second Democratic challenger to Biden. On April 25, 2023, President Joe Biden announced he was running for re-election with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate. In October 2023, Kennedy Jr. announced he would be withdrawing from the Democratic primary to run an Independent campaign for president. A few weeks later, U.S. Representative from Minnesota Dean Phillips announced his candidacy on October 26, 2023. Spiritual author Marianne Williamson ended her campaign on February 7, 2024. She would then re-enter the race a few weeks later after winning 3% of the vote in the Michigan primary. Williamson would end her campaign again on June 11, 2024. During the first presidential debate in late June, many people saw that Biden did not do well with his polling numbers showing him losing to Trump by a bigger margin than before. Many Democrats wanted him to end his campaign with Marianne Williamson re-entering the race a third time. On July 21, 2024, Biden announced that he was ending his presidential campaign, allowing the Democratic Party to choose a new candidate. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. The next day, most of the delegates said they would vote for Harris, enough for her to become the presumptive nominee. On August 6, 2024, Harris picked Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz as her running mate. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker, Arizona U.S. Senator Mark Kelly and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg were seriously considered as running mate options and were vetted by the Harris campaign as well. The Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago, Illinois at the United Center between August 19 to 22, 2024. === Democratic nominee === === Withdrew after the primaries === Name Born Experience Home state Campaign announced Campaign suspended Campaign Ref Marianne Williamson (age ) Houston, Texas Author Founder of Project Angel Food Candidate for president in 2020 Washington, D.C.

He was found not guilty in his second impeachment in 2021 and was able to run again in the 2024 election. He is the second president, after Grover Cleveland, to serve two non- consecutive terms, making him both the 45th and 47th president of the United States. House Democrats considered using the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent Trump from being eligible to run again. Trump is the first president since Richard Nixon to win his party's nomination three times. The last president to run after leaving office was Theodore Roosevelt, who came in second in the 1912 election as the candidate of the Progressive Party, although Herbert Hoover did seek the Republican nomination at national conventions after leaving office in 1933. On November 11, 2022, former Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton became the first Republican major candidate. On November 15, 2022, he officially announced his candidacy to a non-consecutive term. On February 14, 2023, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced her candidacy. A week later, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy announced his campaign on February 21. On March 2, 2023, Michigan businessman and writer Perry Johnson announced his campaign after running ads during the Super Bowl in Iowa. In April 2023, former Governor of Arkansas Asa Hutchinson announced his campaign and so did Texas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley, while South Carolina U.S. Senator Tim Scott announced an exploratory committee for a possible presidential campaign. Scott would file to run on May 19, 2023. On April 20, conservative radio host and former 2021 California gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder announced his candidacy. On May 24, Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis announced his candidacy. Nearly two weeks later on June 5, former Vice President Mike Pence filed paperwork to run for president. The following day, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced his campaign at a town hall event in New Hampshire. On June 7, Governor of North Dakota Doug Burgum announced his campaign. A week later on June 14, Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez filed to run for president. On June 22, former Texas U.S. Representative Will Hurd announced his campaign. Following the first debate, Suarez withdrew from the election on August 29, after saying non-debate qualified candidates should withdraw from the race. In early October 2023, Hurd and Stapleton withdrew from their candidacies with Hurd supporting Haley. By the end of the month, Johnson and Elder suspended their campaigns and endorsed Trump, whereas Pence dropped out without supporting anyone. On November 12, Senator Tim Scott ended his campaign after having low polling numbers. On December 4, Burgum ended his campaign after low polling numbers and failing to qualify for the last two debates. On January 10, 2024, a week before the Iowa caucus, former Governor Chris Christie ended his campaign, after Trump critics urged him to drop out to help Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire primary. Following Trump's win in the Iowa caucus on January 15, 2024, Vivek Ramaswamy ended his campaign and endorsed Trump, whereas former Governor Asa Hutchinson ended his campaign the following day and endorsed Healey. On January 21, Governor Ron DeSantis ended his campaign and endorsed Trump. On February 27, pastor Ryan Binkley ended his campaign and endorsed Trump. On July 13, 2024, just two days before the Republican National Convention, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump was shot in the right ear in an attempted assassination. Two days after the shooting, Trump picked Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance to be his running mate. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, South Carolina U.S. Senator Tim Scott and Florida U.S. Senator Marco Rubio were also seriously considered and vetted by the Trump campaign to be his running mate. The Republican National Convention was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin at the Fiserv Forum between July 15 and 18, 2024. Other cities considered to host the convention included Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Nashville and Pittsburgh. Similar to other Presidential campaigns, Trump had the issue of age —he turned 78 in June 2024. He will be 82 when his term ends. ===Republican nominee=== === Withdrew during the primaries === The candidate in this section have suspended their campaigns, or have otherwise ceased campaigning and ended their bids for the nomination during the primary season.
