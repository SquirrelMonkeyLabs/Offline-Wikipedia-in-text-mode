Following the release of the EPs Screaming Life, released in 1987, and Fopp, released in 1988, for the Sub Pop record label, the band signed with the independent record label SST and went to work on its first full-length studio album. The resulting album contained elements of psychedelic rock, classic rock, and hardcore punk. The band supported the album with a tour of the United States as well as its first overseas tour. In 1990, the album earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance. ==Track listing== #\"Flower\" (Chris Cornell, Kim Thayil) – 3:25 #\"All Your Lies\" (Cornell, Thayil, Hiro Yamamoto) – 3:51 #\"665\" (Cornell, Yamamoto) – 1:37 #\"Beyond the Wheel\" (Cornell) – 4:20 #\"667\" (Cornell, Yamamoto) – 0:56 #\"Mood for Trouble\" (Cornell) – 4:21 #\"Circle of Power\" (Thayil, Yamamoto) – 2:05 #\"He Didn't\" (Matt Cameron, Cornell) – 2:47 #\"Smokestack Lightning\" (Howlin' Wolf) – 5:07 #\"Nazi Driver\" (Cornell, Yamamoto) – 3:52 #\"Head Injury\" (Cornell) – 2:22 #\"Incessant Mace\" (Cornell, Thayil) – 6:22 #\"One Minute of Silence\" (John Lennon) – 1:00 ==Personnel== *Chris Cornell – vocals, guitar *Kim Thayil – guitar *Hiro Yamamoto – bass, vocals *Matt Cameron – drums *Drew Canulette – production, engineering *Soundgarden – production ==Other websites== * Ultramega OK on the Unofficial Soundgarden Homepage Category:1988 albums Category:Debut albums Category:Soundgarden albums Category:Heavy metal albums",
