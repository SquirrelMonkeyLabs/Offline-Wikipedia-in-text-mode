 "text": "Polymer banknotes are banknotes that are made from polymer (plastic). Because they are made of polymer, they last longer without getting ripped or torn, and they contain special security features that make them harder to copy. Polymer banknotes were created by the Reserve Bank of Australia, CSIRO and the University of Melbourne and were first used as money in Australia in 1988. Lots of countries now use polymer banknotes. Seven countries are now fully using polymer banknotes on all of their banknotes instead of paper. It is twice as expensive to make but lasts four times longer than paper banknotes. It is good for countries with lots of humidity, or wet countries, because the notes do not get damaged when it is wet. Category:Currency",
