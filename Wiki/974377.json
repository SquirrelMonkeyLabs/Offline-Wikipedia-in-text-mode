According to a Midrash in the Talmud, King Nimrod tried to burn Abraham but Abraham survived so Haran said that he believed in the God of Abraham and that the Lord would save him with a miracle like how He saved Abraham. So Nimrod threw Haran in the fire and Haran died. Category:Old Testament people",
