 "text": "Hyundai Santa Fe is a mid sized crossover utility vehicle sold by the South Korean automaker Hyundai. It was introduced in 2000 as a mid-sized SUV. It initially replaced the Hyundai Galloper (a badge engineered Mitsubishi Pajero). Beginning in 2006 it was redesigned as a unibody frame crossover utility vehicle. It slots above both the compact Hyundai Tucson and mid sized Hyundai Veracruz. In 2013 the vehicle was given a long wheel-base model allowing third row seating, replacing the Veracruz in many countries (however it is still produced in South Korea) == References == Santa Fe Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles Category:2020s automobiles Category:Sport utility vehicles",
