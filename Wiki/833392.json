He rapped in otherwise standard Italian pop music. In the underground, Radical Stuff published the first Italian hip hop street video called \"Let’s Get Dizzy\" in 1989. Around the same time, Assalti Frontali, an underground hip hop group, was founded in Rome. They are known for their left-wing politically and socially charged lyrics. ===1990s=== Articolo 31, a duo made of J-Ax and DJ Jad, emerged during the mid-'90s with their album Strade di città.
