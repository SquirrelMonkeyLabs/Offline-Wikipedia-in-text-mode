 "text": "A portrait is a painting or a photograph of a person's face and its expression. The purpose of a portrait is to show the likeness, personality, and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography, a portrait is actually not a snapshot, but a calm image of a person in a still position. A portrait normally shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer. == Gallery == File:Jan Vermeer van Delft 007.jpg|Girl with a Pearl Earring, Vermeer's most famous painting.
