He won the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 2006 and was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2015. ==Death== Otto died on 9 March 2015; he was to be publicly announced as the winner of the 2015 Pritzker Prize on 23 March but his death meant the committee announced his award on 10 March. Otto himself had been told earlier that he had won the prize by the executive president of the committee, Martha Thorne. He was reported to have said \"I’ve never done anything to gain this prize. Prizewinning is not the goal of my life. I try to help poor people, but what shall I say here — I’m very happy\". ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1925 births Category:2015 deaths Category:German architects Category:German civil engineers Category:People from Chemnitz Category:Pritzker Architecture Prize winners",
