Corruption is a big part of the historical model of government. It is seen as the reason the rule of law is weak in Russia. Transparency International said in 2022, \"Corruption is endemic in Russia\". Russia had the lowest score in Europe in the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2021. It has been said to be a kleptocracy, an oligarchy, and a plutocracy. == Related pages == * 2021 Russian protests ==References== ==Other websites== * Transparency International Russia (English Version) http://transparency.org.ru/en/ * \"Corruption and institutions in Russia\" Mark Levin, Georgy Satarov, Foundation for Information on Democracy http://www.indem.ru/satarov/satarov_levin/corruption.htm#1 Category:Politics of Russia Russia",
