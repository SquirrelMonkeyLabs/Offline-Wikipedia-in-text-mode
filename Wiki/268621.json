 "text": "Wheat flour is a type of flour made from wheat kernels. There are two main types of wheat flour: whole wheat flour and white flour. Whole wheat flour has the whole grain of wheat, making it more nutritious. White flour only has the endosperm of the wheat grain, making it less nutritious. White flour is preferred by many people. White flours are normally enriched. Wheat flour can be sifted to make it finer and smoother. ==Related pages== * Kinako ==References== Category:Flour Category:Wheat",
