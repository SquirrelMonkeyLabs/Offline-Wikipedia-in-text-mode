It lives in China. Scientists think it might also live in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. There are some frogs in India, Myanmar, and Thailand, but scientists are not sure if this is the same species of frog. This frog lives in forests on hills and mountains. People have seen it on small plants and on the ground. People have seen this frog between 300 and 1350 meters above sea level. This frog lays eggs in pools of water. The tadpoles swim in the pools. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. It is in a little danger from people cutting down forests to make farms and from visitors to the forest. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks, for example Dayaoshan National Nature Reserve. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
