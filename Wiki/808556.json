 "text": "The Johan Cruyff Shield (Dutch: Johan Cruijff Schaal), or sometimes known as the Dutch Super Cup, is a football trophy. It is named after former Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff. It is played between the winner of the Eredivisie and the winner of the KNVB Cup. If 1 team wins both the Eredivisie and the KNVB Cup, the team that finished 2nd in the Eredivisie would replace the KNVB Cup winners. ==History== ===Super Cup=== The first Super Cup match was played on 25 June 1949.
