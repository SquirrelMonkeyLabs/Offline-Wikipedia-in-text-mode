It focuses on two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who allege they were sexually abused by the singer Michael Jackson as children. It also shows the effects on the alleged victims' families. The movie is a co-production between the UK broadcaster Channel 4 and the US broadcaster Home Box Office (HBO). It premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2019, and was broadcast in two parts in March. In January 2019, the Jackson estate issued a press release condemning the film, saying: \"The two accusers testified under oath that these events never occurred. They have provided no independent evidence and absolutely no proof in support of their accusations.\" Reed is open to producing a sequel. On Rotten Tomatoes, Leaving Neverland holds an approval rating of 97% based on 65 reviews, with an average score of 7.76/10. ==References== Category:2019 documentary movies Category:British documentary movies Category:American documentary movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Michael Jackson",
