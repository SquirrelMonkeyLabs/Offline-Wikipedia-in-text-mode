 "text": "The Alamo is an old Spanish mission (like a church built by Catholic missionaries to minister to the natives) in what is now San Antonio, Texas, United States. The Alamo was authorized in 1718 but was not built until 1744. Its original name was San Antonio de Valero Mission. The Alamo is most famous for the Battle of the Alamo, which took place there in 1836. It was occupied by 187 men from Texas and elsewhere who were fighting for the independence of Texas, which was then in Mexico. the men in the Alamo were defeated by a force of 5,000 Mexican troops. General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna was the general for the Mexican Army. Nearly all of the defenders were killed, and \"Remember the Alamo!\" became the battle cry of the Texas Revolution. The battle ended on March 6, 1836, when those who surrendered were executed. Many years later, the Texas government restored the Alamo. The Alamo became a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and is now open for tourists. It also became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on July 5, 2015. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Texas Category:San Antonio, Texas Category:1724 establishments Category:18th-century establishments in Mexico",
