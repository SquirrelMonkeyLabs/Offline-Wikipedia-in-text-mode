 "text": "Gustav Gerneth (15 October 1905 – 21 October 2019) was a German World War II- veteran and claimed to be the oldest man ever in Germany, as well as the oldest living man in the world at the time of his death. However, his age is not validated by Guinness World Records and Gerontology Research Group. Gerneth worked in a shipping company and at a gas plant during World War II. He was a Russian prisoner-of-war until 1947 when he was released from imprisonment. He married his wife Charlotte (died in 1988) in 1930 and the couple had three sons, all of whom now deceased. If his claimed age is true, Gerneth became the oldest living man in Europe after Spaniard Francisco Núñez- Olivera's death on 29 January 2018, and later also the first German person to become 113 and 114 years old as well as the oldest living man in the world on 19 January 2019 after the death of Japaneseman Masazo Nonaka, who became the oldest living man after Núñez-Olivera's death (Nonaka died on 20 January Japanese time). Nonaka and Gerneth were, after the death of Americanman Richard Overton (also a World War II-veteran) on 27 December 2018, the last two living men born before 1907. Gerneth lived in Saxony-Anhalt in the same brick house with steep entrance stairs for over 40 years, before his death just a week after celebrating his claimed 114th birthday. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:2019 deaths Category:German centenarians Category:Supercentenarians Category:People from Szczecin",
