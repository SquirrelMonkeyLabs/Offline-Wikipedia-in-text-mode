 "text": "\"Measure of a Man\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Jack Ingram. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Shaun Silva and premiered in May 31, 2007. It starts with Ingram finishing a call in a phone booth, before driving off in his vintage car. Eventually the car breaks down and he calls a mechanic (played by his own father) and he comes to help him with the car. He hands his dad a picture of his family, scared of what his father's reaction will be. The father accepts, and emotionally the two embrace. Ingram is also seen performing the song with his band under an overpass (the same one his car breaks down under). The video makes use of multi-screening in certain scenes (mainly the band performance). The video debuted at number 20 on CMT's Top 20 Countdown for the week of June 21, 2007. ==References== Category:2007 songs Category:Jack Ingram songs Category:Music videos directed by Shaun Silva",
