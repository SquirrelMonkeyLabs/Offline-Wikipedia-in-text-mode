He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1965 for his discoveries about the genetic control of enzyme and virus synthesis which he shared with Fran√ßois Jacob and Andre Lwoff. Monod's best-known work explains how llife is the product of a combination of chance and necessity.Monod, Jacques 1971. Chance and necessity: an essay on the natural philosophy of modern biology. New York, Alfred A. Knopf. It has been described as a \"manifesto of materialist biology in the most reductivist sense\",Jeffery S. Wicken. 1984. \"The cosmic breath: reflections on the thermodynamics of creation\". Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science. because Monod says that systems in nature can be explained without introducing any end-goal or purpose. He then argues that certain beliefs and ethics followed from his outlook on biology: atheism, rationalism, anti-Marxism.Judson, Horace Freeland 1979. The eighth day of creation: the makers of the revolution in biology. Simon & Schuster, New York. p591 During World War II he was a member of the French Resistance. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1976 deaths Category:French biochemists Category:French academics Category:French atheists Category:French Nobel Prize winners Category:French people of World War II Category:French geneticists Category:Recipients of the Order of the Legion of Honour Category:Scientists from Paris",
