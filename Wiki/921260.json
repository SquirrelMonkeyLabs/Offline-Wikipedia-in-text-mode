 "text": "Xenohyla eugenioi is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 128 and 960 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in bromeliad plants that grow in dry forests and on rocky ground. Scientists believe the frog's tadpoles swim in ponds that dry up for part of the year, but they are not sure. This frog is not in danger of dying out, but there are fewer of them than there were. Scientists say this is because human beings take away its bromeliad plants and change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for animals to eat grass and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
