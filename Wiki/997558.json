Bionity.com. Retrieved 2023-02-25 A dipeptide is made up of only two amino acids: one amino acid on each side of a peptide bond. A dipeptide can be made from two different amino acids or by two amino acids of the same kind. A peptide bond will be in between the two amino acids. Gly-Gly, or Glycylglycine is a dipeptide and also the simplest peptide. It is the dipeptide of Glycine.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201702425. Wiley Online Library.
