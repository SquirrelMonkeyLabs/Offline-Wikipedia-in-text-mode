This is a biography of two great music composers - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Salieri knows Mozart is a great composer but tries to stop him out of jealousy. The movie was shot on location in Prague, Kroměříž and Vienna. Notably, Forman was able to shoot scenes in the Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague, where Don Giovanni and La Clemenza di Tito were first shown two centuries before. Several other scenes were shot at the Barrandov Studios. ==Cast== * F.
