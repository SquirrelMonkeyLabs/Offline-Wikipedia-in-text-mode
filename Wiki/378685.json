 "text": "Love's Labour's Won was probably the name of a play William Shakespeare wrote before 1603. One theory is that it was a sequel to another play, possibly Love's Labour's Lost. Another theory is that the play survived, but with a different name. Today, no copies of the play exist. Category:Plays by William Shakespeare",
