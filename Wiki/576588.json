 "text": "Ferrosilicon is a combination of iron and silicon. Between 15% and 90% of ferrosilicon is silicon. Ferrosilicon is made by burning sand while thereâ€™s iron in the sand. Ferrosilicons that contain the most silicon are made in electric arc furnaces. Ferrosilicon is a reducing agent. It is used to take oxygen out of metals. The Pidgeon process uses ferrosilicon to reduce dolomite and make magnesium metal. == Hydrogen production == When ferrosilicon is touching water, it may slowly make hydrogen. Ferrosilicon is used by the military to quickly produce hydrogen for balloons. The chemical reaction uses sodium hydroxide, ferrosilicon, and water. The generator is small enough to fit in a truck and needs only a small amount of electric power. The materials are stable and not combustible, and they do not make hydrogen until mixed. ==References== Category:Iron alloys Category:Silicon alloys",
