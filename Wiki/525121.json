 "text": "Deschooling is a word that was first used by Ivan Illich (Austrian philosopher, 1926â€“2002). Many homeschoolers use the word to describe the process that children go through when they left the school system to start homeschooling. It is an important process for homeschooling, in which children should prepare for their first homeschool days. Some children need more time to go through it than others. Families do this normally because many things in homeschooling are different from the public school system. == References == == Other websites == * Deschooling: How Long Does it Take? * Deschooling on www.homeschool.com Category:Education",
