 "text": "The Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp are a Minor League Baseball team from Jacksonville, Florida. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Jumbo Shrimp are partnered with the Miami Marlins, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Marlins. The team started playing baseball in 1962 as the Jacksonville Suns. They did not play in 1969, but they did play from 1970 to 1984. The team changed their name to the Jacksonville Expos in 1985. They changed it back to Suns in 1991. In 2017, they changed their name to \"Jumbo Shrimp\" because lots of shrimp are caught in the area. The Jumbo Shrimp have played at a stadium called 121 Financial Ballpark since 2003. Before that, they played at Sam W. Wolfson Baseball Park. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1960s establishments in Florida Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Jacksonville, Florida Category:Miami Marlins",
