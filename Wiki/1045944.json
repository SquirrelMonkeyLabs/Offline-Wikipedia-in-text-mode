 "text": "\"I'm Not Human\" is a song by American rappers XXXTentacion and Lil Uzi Vert. The song was released on January 23, 2023, which would have been X's 25th birthday. The song was able to make it to #21 on RMNZ's Hot Singles Chart. During a Q&A; on Adin Ross's livestream, Uzi said that they were going to work on a song with X and that they got a phone call from X while X was in prison where he rapped a song to them. Uzi was asked how it felt to work on a song after X's murder, they said \"I'd love to do a song with [X], but I'm really weird on stuff like that. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it took me really long to do that with another artist. I'm really weird because I understand that they're not here living and what if that's not the vision they really want? Especially if they really fucked with me. What if that's all wrong, I'd be pissed off if like they did it all wrong and I'm not here. But you know, if it works out, it works out.\" In the song, X sings about he doesn't feel like he fits in, feels empty inside and doesn't feel basic human emotion. He says that his girlfriend can tell him her emotions because he is already broken and can handle it. Uzi sings about how they want to find a place to fit in and that are tired of the World insulting them. When it was first uploaded, X had an interpolation of the song \"Snuff\" by Slipknot but it was later removed and re-uploaded with it because they didn't get the clearance to it. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2023 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Folk songs",
