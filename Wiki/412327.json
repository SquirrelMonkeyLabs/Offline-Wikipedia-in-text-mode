Henry Russell climbed this peak in June 1864.Many articles (see other Wikipedias) say that Henry Russell climbed the peak together with his French guide Jean-Jacques Denjean but Russell wrote that Denjean stayed sleeping in a house and that he went up to Pica d'Estats with the owner of the house, an unknown \"young man\". In the same pages, he wrote that he had visited the region seven or eight years before but he did not say if he visited d'Estats at that time. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Altituderando: Pic du Montcalm - Pic d'Estats - Pic Verdaguer * Camptocamp.org Category:Pyrenees Category:Mountains of France Category:Ariège (department) Category:Province of Lleida",
