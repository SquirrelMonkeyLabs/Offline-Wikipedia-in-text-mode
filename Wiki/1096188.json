 "text": "The Jinxiu bubble-nest frog or Jinxiu small tree frog (Orixalus jinxiuensis) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and in China in Yunnan Province, Guanxi Province, and Guangdong Province. People have seen it 1080 meters above sea level in China and between 1850 and 2050 meters above sea level in Vietnam. This frog is 24 â€“ 32.0 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. This frog lives in forests where the trees grow close together and on smaller woody plants near the edges of forests. The frogs lay eggs in pools in July and August. The tadpoles swim in the pools. Human beings cut down the forests where the frog lives. Chemicals meant to kill pests, chemicals that make farm plants grow, and pollution can kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
