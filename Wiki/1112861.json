The shorts are a loose follow up to a similar series from Big City Greens. ==Production== ===Ideas=== The earliest idea for Hailey's On It! was made when Devin Bunje and Nick Stanton came up with a scenario of a girl not paying attention to a time- traveling messenger. The duo grew interested in the characters and slowly began to make more ideas about what would grow into the series. The show was at first named I Will NOT Kiss Scott Federman. On November 18, 2021, Disney Branded Television said that Hailey's On It! had been allowed to do a 20-episode first season. Meredith Roberts, a Disney Television Animation worker, describes the series as the first show by Bunje and Stanton. Roberts called it a \"fast-paced comedy\" with \"grounded stories\" and \"heart\" which made it a \"perfect fit\" for Disney. The series was described as pointed to kids aged 6 to 14 and their families. On June 15, 2022, Disney Branded Television said that Hailey's On It! would be getting 10 more episodes, taking the total from 20 videos to a 30 video count for the first season. It was also said that Howy Parkins would be a co-executive producer. Bunje and Stanton would be supervising directors. Reports also said Wade Wisinski would be the show's producer. Karen Graci would be the show's story editor. Lee Ann Dufour would be the show's art director. In December 2022, the Daily Sundial said that artist Jaison Wilson, who has worked on The Princess and the Frog, Milo Murphy's Law, Candace Against the Universe, and Amphibia, would be working on the series. On April 28, the show's first trailer was let out. A press noted that the show's guest cast would have Brian Jordan Alvarez, Blake Anderson, Mick Foley, Jo Koy, Jack McBrayer, Bebe Neuwirth, Chris Parnell, Tim Robinson, Natasha Rothwell, Brandon Mychal Smith, Martin Starr, and Al Yankovic. The same day, it was said that Cat Harman-Mitchell and Leslie Park would be show directors. ===Writing=== Writers for the show would have Mary Gulino and Kevin Yee. Karen Graci is the story editor. Bunje and Stanton said the use of animation gave them greater creation freedom than their live-action works. Due to the often changes made to the show's story during development, the writers avoided having the stuff on Hailey's list to all be named, instead wanting the content as they made the story for each video in order to allow greater creativeness. The character of Beta was created because the writers wanted a way to \"organize and prioritize list items\" without always relying on the list itself, with the idea of a technologically advanced smartphone being conceived due to the dynamic such character could have with Hailey. Beta was originally meant to be a minor character, but his role was expanded after the writers enjoyed Gary Anthony Williams' performance and further developed him. == Music == The series features K-pop, rock, pop-rock, electronic dance, and musical theater tracks. A digital soundtrack with six original songs was let out on June 9 by Walt Disney Records. Matthew Tishler and Andrew Underberg are songwriters/composers for the show. ===Tracklist=== == Broadcast == The series came at the same time on Disney Channel and Disney XD on June 8, 2023. It came on Disney+ the following day. Several \"Theme Song Takeover,\" \"Broken Karaoke\" and \"Chibi Tiny Tales\" shorts featuring characters from the show began airing in July. The series has a TV-Y7 parental guideline. == Reception == === Critical response === Matthew Aguilar of ComicBook.com described Hailey's On It! as a \"delightful new comedy adventure series.\" Rob Schwarz of FanSided said the show is \"wonderful for families with children of any age,\" saying it empowers women, and loved the different characters. Ashley Moulton of Common Sense Media gave Hailey's On It! a score of four out of five stars, loved the good messages and role models, noting friendship and courage, while loving the educational value, writing, \"Teen girl role model shines in funny action- adventure.\" === Awards === The show won Outstanding Kids & Family Programming or Film - Animated at the 2024 GLAAD Media Awards. == In other media == === Video games === Following the show's release, DisneyNOW sent updates for the games Bubble Burst and Color Splash related to the show. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:American animated television series Category:Television series by Disney Category:2023 American television series debuts",
