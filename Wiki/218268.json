 "text": "The Revised Julian calendar is a variation of the Julian calendar. It is mainly used by Eastern Orthodox churches. Some Eastern Orthodox churches introduced it in 1923. ==Leap years== #If the year number can be divided by four without rest, the year is a leap year (same as Julian calendar and Gregorian calendar). #If the year can be divided by 100, it is not a leap year (same as Gregorian calendar). #If dividing the year by 900 leaves a remainder of 200 or 600, the year is a leap year. Until the year 2800, this calendar will be in sync with the Gregorian calendar; From 2800 to 2900, the Gregorian calendar will be 1 day off. == Related pages == * Gregorian calendar * Julian calendar Category:Eastern Orthodox Church Category:Calendars",
