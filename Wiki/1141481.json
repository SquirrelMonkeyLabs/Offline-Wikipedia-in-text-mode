 "text": "Jeanne Mance (1606-1673) was a French nurse and a key figure in the founding of Montreal, Canada. She arrived in New France shortly after the Ursuline nuns and established the Hôtel-Dieu, Montreal's first hospital, in 1645. Born in Langres, France, she became responsible for her siblings after her mother's death and later cared for those affected by war and disease. At the age of 34, Mance felt a missionary calling and decided to move to New France, where she aimed to create a hospital for the community. She traveled to Montreal in 1641, helped establish the city in 1642, and initially operated a hospital from her home. In 1645, with financial support from France, she opened a dedicated hospital building. Mance made several trips back to France to secure funding and resources for the hospital, including bringing sisters to assist her. She continued to manage the hospital until her later years, when she stepped back from direct involvement. Jeanne Mance died in 1673 and was buried at the Hôtel-Dieu. Her contributions are commemorated in various locations, including Rue Jeanne-Mance and Jeanne-Mance Park in Montreal, reflecting her lasting impact on the city's history.
