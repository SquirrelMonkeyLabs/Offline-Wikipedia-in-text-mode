 "text": "The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae. These birds are adapted to aerial feeding. \"Swallow\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. Within the swallow, the name \"martin\" tends to be used for the squarer-tailed species, and the name \"swallow\" for the more fork-tailed species. However, there is no scientific distinction between these two groups. The family contains around 83 species in 19 genera. category:Passeri",
