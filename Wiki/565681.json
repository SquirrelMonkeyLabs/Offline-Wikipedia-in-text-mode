 "text": "Šiprage (Шипраге) is a settlement in the Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska entity, Kotor Varoš Municipality. The first Kotor-Varosian settlement, the medieval town Kotor, existed certainly before the 9th century, because, according to credible sources, it was previously \"destroyed several times.\" It was named as Vasekatro „near Banja Luka“. Šiprage is on the Vrbanja river. In 1991, 956 people lived in Šiprage. The highest elevation is 520 m. During the Bosnian War (1992–95), Bosnian Serb Police and Army forces destroyed villages upstream along the Vrbanja to Kruševo Brdo. One of the 18 camps for detained Bosniaks from the Kotor Varoš Municipality was at the Police station (MUP) in Šiprage. After 1996, most of the Bosniak villages were partly restored thanks to the Luxembourgish government. During the war, an Orthodox church was built in the centre of the village. ==Climate== Month Average temperature (°C) Minimal temperature (°C) Maximal temperature (°C) Precipitation / Rainfall (mm) January –1.7 –4.8 1.4 59 February 0.3 –3.6 4.2 63 March''' 4.6 –0.1 9.3 59 April 9.1 3.9 14.3 74 May 13.6 8.1 19.2 90 June 17.2 11.5 22.9 99 July 18.9 12.6 25.3 81 August 18.4 11.9 24.9 76 September 14.7 8.6 20.9 71 October''' 9.5 4.7 14.4 79 November''' 4.4 1 7.8 100 December 0.1 –2.7 3 88 ==Population== ===Overview by census=== Year 1879. 1885. 1895. 1910 1921. 1931. 1948. 1953. 1961. 1971. 1981. 1991. 2013.
