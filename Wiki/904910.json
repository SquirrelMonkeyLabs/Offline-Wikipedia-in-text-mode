 "text": "The ledge tree frog (Bokermannohyla saxicola) is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives in the Serra do Espinhaço and Serra de Cipó mountains, usually more than 800 meters above sea level. This frog is 5.0 to 5.4 cm long from nose to rear end. These frogs live in montane meadows, grassy places partway up mountains. It lays eggs in rocky streams. This frog only lives below 800 meters above sea level when the streams stay rocky that low. Scientists have seen it as close to sea level as 600 meters, always by rocky streams. The tadpoles take about five months to grow. There are four different groups of ledge tree frogs, each living around the top of a different mountain. Scientists looked at the frog's DNA. They saw it became its own species 6.1 million years ago, during the c. 6.1 million years ago Miocene era. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
