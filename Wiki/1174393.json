 "text": "Fields Stores Ltd. is a Canadian chain of discount stores. They have headquarters in Delta, British Columbia. They have around 66 stores in Canada. In 1950, Joseph Segal and Saul \"Sonny\" Wosk opened their first Fields store in Vancouver, British Columbia. They were going to originally name the store Thrifty’s but chose Fields instead. Segal became president of Fields in 1968 and took the company public. Fields then purchased Spencer’s Stores Ltd., Payless Store, and Mackenzie’s Ltd. within two years. On December 2, 1972, Fields purchased the hardware company Marshall Wells Ltd. from Gamble Canada Ltd. for $7.5 million. In 1974, Fields expanded into Saskatchewan after they opened their first store in Moose Jaw. On July 27, 1976, Fields purchased and took over a majority 50.1% ownership of the Zellers discount store chain for $32.6 million. They ended up being taken over themselves after Zellers' shareholders reversed the takeover. Segal then became the president of Zellers. In December 2011, Hudson's Bay Company announced that they were going to close all Fields stores. On May 1, 2012, the Fields chain was purchased from Hudson's Bay Company by Ontario-based FHC Holdings Ltd. and kept open. They also operate stores under the McFrugals name. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1950 establishments in Canada Category:Companies based in British Columbia Category:Department stores of Canada Category:Discount stores of Canada",
