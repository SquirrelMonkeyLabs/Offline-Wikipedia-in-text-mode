An evaluation of crisis hotline outcomes. Part 2: Suicidal callers. Suicide Life Threat Behav. 2007 Jun;37(3):338-52. PMID 1757954 and AustraliaKing R, Nurcombe B, Bickman L, Hides L, et al. Telephone counselling for adolescent suicide prevention: changes in suicidality and mental state from beginning to end of a counselling session. Suicide Life Threat Behav. 2003 Winter;33(4):400-11. PMID 14695055 which show that suicide crisis lines may help people who feel like killing or hurting themselves and may make them feel better. One of the first of these \"hotlines\" was the Samaritans, created in 1953 by Chad Varah in the United Kingdom, who managed the church in London which at that time was called St. Steven's Church. He believed there should be a place where people can listen to visitors and callers who thought about killing themselves, and help them feel better. He had this idea after giving a speech to help comfort the family and friends of a 13-year-old girl. Before her death, the girl was extremely worried and had nobody to talk to. ==Crisis line organizations by country== Country (666 = international) Lines Algeria * 34342 and 43 are the national emergency numbers for police and ambulances in Algeria. * Suicide Hotline Algeria: 0021 3983 2000 58 Argentina * 911 is the national emergency number in Argentina. *Centro de Asistencia al Suicida by calling 135 (Greater Buenos Aires) or 5275-1135 (rest of the country). *SOS Un Amigo Anonimo is available seven days a week from 10 AM to 7 PM by calling 4783–8888.
