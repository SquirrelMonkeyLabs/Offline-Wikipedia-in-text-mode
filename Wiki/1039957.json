 "text": "The Umayyad dynasty () or Umayyads () was an Arab clan within the Quraysh tribe who were the ruling family of the Umayyad Caliphate between 661 and 750 and later of Al-Andalus between 756 and 1031. Umayya ibn Abd Shams (), the wartime commander of the Meccans, was the progenitor of the line of the Umayyad dynasty. He was also the grandfather of Mu'awiya I, the founder of the Umayyad Caliphate.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PVu0EAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA5&dq;=Umayya+ibn+Abd+Shams+grandfather+of+Muawiya&hl;=en&newbks;=1&newbks;_redir=0&source;=gb_mobile_search&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjd_r66i5eBAxWrV0EAHXrECmwQ6AF6BAgGEAM#v=onepage&q;&f;=falsehttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J2OaAgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA164&dq;=Umayya+ibn+Abd+Shams+grandfather&hl;=en&newbks;=1&newbks;_redir=0&source;=gb_mobile_search&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjIgcaZjJeBAxUwWUEAHXXqCpQQ6AF6BAgLEAM#v=onepage&q;&f;=false The Islamic Empire reached its largest geographical extent under the Umayyads. Under the Umayyads, Al-Andalus also became a centre of science, medicine, philosophy and invention during the Islamic Golden Age. ==In popular culture== The Umayyads have been the subject of many tales, both factual and fictitious. Umayyad Caliphs are referenced throughout the Arabic collection of the 101 Nights (Arabic: مائة ليلة وليلة), also known as The Book with the Story of the 101 Nights, and Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and his three sons enjoy a similar status in the 101 Nights as that of the Abbasid ruler Harun al-Rashid in the 1,001 Nights.https://egyptindependent.com/arabian-nights-has-smaller- sibling/ ==References== Category:Al-Andalus",
