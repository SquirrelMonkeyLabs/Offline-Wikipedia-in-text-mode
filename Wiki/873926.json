 "text": "The Agua Rica leaf frog (Calllimedusa ecuatoriana) is a frog that lives in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 1300 and 1900 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 5.5 cm long. This frog has purple color on parts of its skin and large orange patches. It has a white stripe down the side of its jaw and body. Its belly is pale orange. Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because humans change the place where the frog lives to dig good rocks out of the ground, make places for cows to eat grass, and to build towns. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
