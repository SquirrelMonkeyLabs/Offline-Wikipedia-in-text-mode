 "text": "An obscene phone call is when someone uses bad, sexual or hateful language while talking to another person on a telephone. In many U.S. states, making an obscene telephone call is a Class 1 Misdemeanor. The victims of substandard or obscene telephone calls should hang up on the callers and report the incidents to their telephone company or local police. Even if/when Caller IDs aren't shown, calls are logged by the telephone company. This is so the obscene caller's number can be discovered. But many obscene phone callers use payphones or mobile phones instead of regular landline phones. Obscene phone callers are often male. However, there are many female obscene phone callers. Some obscene phone callers have trouble forming relationships, so making obscene telephone calls is the only way they express themselves. The usual age for making such telephone calls is the teenage years, particularly ages 12 to 16. The average age is 14. ==References== Category:Crime",
