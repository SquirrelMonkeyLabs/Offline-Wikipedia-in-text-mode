 "text": "James Harvey \"Jamie\" Kennedy (born May 25, 1970) is an American stand-up comedian, television producer, screenwriter and actor. He was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. He came to prominence in the late 1990s for playing Randy Meeks in the Scream movie series. Kennedy formed a production company called Wannabe Producers, alongside Josh Etting, through which he has produced the shows The Jamie Kennedy Experiment, Blowin' Up, The Starlet, and Living with Fran. Following Malibu's Most Wanted, in which he both wrote and acted, Kennedy co-wrote the MTV show Blowin' Up (2006) featuring his friend Stu Stone. In 2008, Kennedy released the documentary Heckler, about the plight of stand-up comics versus their often-aggressive audiences. == Filmography == Year Title Role Notes 1989 Dead Poets Society Extra Uncredited 1994 VR Troopers Elmo Episode: \"Cybertron\" 1994 California Dreams Hiccup Guy Sea Kelp 2 episodes 1995 Unhappily Ever After Stoney / Pony Burger Attendant (voice) 3 episodes 1995 Ellen Tad 2 episodes 1996 Romeo + Juliet Sampson 1996 Scream Randy Meeks 1997 Coax Jamie Short film 1997 Bongwater Tommy 1997 On the Edge of Innocence Luke Canby TV Movie 1997 Clockwatchers Eddie 1997 Perversions of Science Spaceman John Episode: \"Panic\" 1997 Sparkler Trent 1997 Scream 2 Randy Meeks Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor - Horror 1997 As Good as It Gets Street Hustler 1998 Stricken Banyon 1998 Starstruck George Gordon Flynn 1998 The Pass' Deputy Jim Banks 1998 Soundman Frank's assistant / Marty (voice) 1998 Enemy of the State Jamie 1999 Bowfinger Dave 1999 Three Kings Walter Wogaman 2000 Road to Flin Flon Brad 2000 Stark Raving Mad Doobs Episode: \"My Bodyguard\" 2000 Boiler Room Adam 2000 Scream 3 Randy Meeks Cameo 2000 Bait Agent Blum 2000 Amok 2001 Slacker Cats Buckley (voice) TV Movie 2001 Dr. Dolittle 2 Various (voice) 2001 Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back Chaka's Production Assistant 2001 Strange Frequency Pete Derek Episode: \"A Change Will Do You Good\" 2001 Max Keeble's Big Move Evil Ice Cream Man 2001 Pretty When You Cry Albert Straka 2001–2002 Da Möb Rooster (voice) 7 episodes 2002 Bug Dwight 2002 Night Visions Mark Stevens episode: \"Cargo\" 2002–2004 Host 61 episodes 2003 Malibu's Most Wanted Brad 'B-Rad' Gluckman 2003 Sol Goode Justin Sax 2003 King of the Hill Dr. Tim Rast (voice) Episode: \"Queasy Rider\" 2004 King of the Hill Fudgie / Police Chief (voice) Episode: \"Phish and Wildlife\" 2004 Crank Yankers Wally Palumbo (voice) Episode: \"2.23\" 2004 Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Creepy Guy Uncredited 2005 Son of the Mask Tim Avery/The Mask Nominated—Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor Nominated—Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple (with anybody stuck sharing the screen with him) 2005 Dinotopia: Quest for the Ruby Sunstone Spazz (voice) 2005 Living with Fran TV Announcer Episode: \"Who's the Parent?\" 2006 Farce of the Penguins Jamie (voice) 2006 Wild 'n Out Himself 2006 Mind of Mencia Will Pillowbiter Episode: \"Stereotype Olympics\" 2007 Me & Lee?
