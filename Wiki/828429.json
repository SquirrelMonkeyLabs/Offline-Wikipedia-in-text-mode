 "text": "Plan Challe or Challe Plan was a French military operation during the Algerian War. General Maurice Challe had the idea for the Challe Plan. It lasted from 6 February 1959 - 6 April 1961. ==Operation== In Plan Challe, the French Army attacked the FLN fighters. The French sent reserve units and conscript units to defend places in which they would not have to be moblie such as to protect roads. That way, regular French army units could perform search and destroy missions in the mountains, where guerrilla fighters were hiding. The army used helicopters to move special mobile units composed of elite troops such as Foreign Legionnaires, paratroopers, marines, special commandos units, and air mobile regulars. The elite forces never exceeded more than 20,000 soldiers. Plan Challe was a series of sweeps into places in which the French army knew guerrilla fighters were hiding. By taking regular troops away from defence, Challe broke down large formations into small units, many of which had both French soldiers and Algerian soldiers in them. The groups of soldiers could move quickly so that the guerrillas had to fight them in rough country. \"The highly sophisticated operational and tactical scenario was virtually the same. Utilizing primarily air-gathered intelligence and without warning, the elite units and the air force move at tremendous speed onto enemy territory. The strike usually takes place at dawn. First, the target area is bombed out of existence and showered with cluster bombs from fighter jets and bombers. Within few minutes, the paratroopers land in the heart of the insurgent territory with close air support provided by armed helicopters. The elite force engages immediately the insurgents while fighters, bombers, armed helicopters patrolled the battle space and strafe or bomb any insurgents leaving the area. Additional troops are brought in by helicopters to close the immediate net around the insurgents. A larger contingent of regular troops and Commandos de chasse (hunter class troops) are convoyed to several spots around the battle space to ambush and pursue the survivors. The aircraft are relieved when the area is under control by the elite troops and when the regular contingent is in place. The command and control post (Joint Operations Command) is always shared by Air Force and Army commanders. The operation is dismantled at sundown and the elite troops are withdrawn leaving the local (secteur) regular troop to finish the job and keep the area clean. It was devastating to the FLN, in terms of lives and moral.\" Military analysis, Plan Challe http://militaryanalysis.blogspot.com/2017/07/plan-challe.html?m=1 ==Aftermath== Plan Challe was a clear military victory for France. The FLN had only around 5,000 soldiers left because many of them had fled from Algeria to nearby countries like Morocco and Tunisia, where the FLN leadership was based. The fighters that did not flee Algeria were forced into hiding because the French military presence was overwhelming.War in Algeria: The French Experience https://smallwarsjournal.com/documents/martin.pdf Plan Challe helped France to win the Algerian War militarily and led to Charles de Gaulle on 29 June 1961 announcing on live television that fighting in Algeria was virtually over.Cairns, John (1962). \"Algeria: The Last Ordeal\".
