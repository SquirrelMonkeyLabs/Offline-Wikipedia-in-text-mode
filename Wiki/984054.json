 "text": "Gothic architecture was a historical building style in European art, which lasted from about 1200 to about 1500. Most of the buildings done in the style are churches or cathedrals. The style was also used for palaces, and buildings that had no association with the church. Many of the ideas and concepts used when building churches were also used for buildings, which had no relation to the church. == Castles and palaces == Andria, Province of Barletta-Andria- Trani, Italy - panoramio (13).jpg|Castel del Monte in Apulia, 1240–1250, Gothic and proto-renaissance - this palace did not have any military function Façade du Palais des Papes.jpg|Palace of the Popes in Avignon, former papal residence, 1334–1370 Windsor Castle - panoramio (13).jpg|Windsor Castle, from 1350 Il Castello di Pandino.JPG|Palace of the Visconti in Pandino, 1355–1370 Castillo de Malbork, Polonia, 2013-05-19, DD 04.jpg|Malbork palace, 1383–1393 Ca' d'Oro facciata.jpg|Ca' d'Oro in Venice, 1421–1442 A view of Meissen - geo.hlipp.de - 1569.jpg|Meissen castle, late gothivc shortly before the change to Renaissance, 1471–1485 Château de Blois 03.jpg|Wing of Louis XII of Blois Caslre, 1498–1503, late gothic, flamboyant stle, shortly before the change to Renaissance == Town halls, hospitals, etc == Kölner Rathaus - panoramio.jpg|Tower of the town hall in Köln Münster, Historisches Rathaus -- 2014 -- 6855.jpg|Historic town hall in Münster – made of sandstone RM13060 Doesburg - Roggestraat 2.jpg|town hall of Doesburg, Gelderland, Netherlands - this was a Hanseatic city.
