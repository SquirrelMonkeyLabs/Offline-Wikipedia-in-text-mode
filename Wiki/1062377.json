He was found by Batman and Robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters. With his master unable to fight off the kidnappers, Wilker's dog jumped to his defense. He wears a mask to hide his secret identity as Bruce Wayne's dog Ace. There have been several dogs named Ace. This is because dogs have short lifespans. In the Prime Earth, another dog named Titus appeared as the second Bat-Hound before Ace was re- introduced. == Powers and abilities == Ace has super strength and invulnerability as given by the orange Kryptonite.
