 "text": "\"Enter Sandman\" is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It's the opening track and lead single from their self-titled fifth album. The music was written by Kirk Hammett, James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. Vocalist and guitarist Hetfield wrote the lyrics which deal with the concept of a child's nightmares. ==Background== When they were writing the song, Hetfield at first had \"disrupt the perfect family\" which he wrote about sudden infant death syndrome. He wanted this instead of \"off to never never land\". He also wanted the sandman to kill the baby but said that it was too corny. In an interview with Uncut, Hetfield said: In the song, Hetfield sings the bedtime prayer \"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep\". ==Legacy== The song was able to make it to #10 on the Mainstream Rock, #16 on the Billboard Hot 100, and RPM's Canada Top Singles charts. Both the physical and mastertone releases were certified Gold and the digital release was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 34th Grammy Awards but lost to Sting's \"The Soul Cages\". ==Music video== A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Wayne Isham. In the video, a child is in bed having nightmares while sleeping. In his nightmares, he is drowning, jumps off a building, gets covered in snakes and is chased by a semi truck. R. G. Armstrong plays the old man in the video. ==Track listings== US single # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:37 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:19 International CD single # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:37 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:19 # \"Enter Sandman (Demo)\" – 5:05 International 12-inch vinyl single (4 tracks) # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:34 # \"Holier Than Thou (Work in Progress...)\" – 3:48 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:17 # \"Enter Sandman (Demo)\" – 5:05 International 12-inch vinyl single (3 tracks) # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:34 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:17 # \"Enter Sandman (Demo)\" – 5:05 International 7-inch vinyl single # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:34 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:17 International 7-inch vinyl picture disc single # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:34 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:17 Australian 2-track CD single # \"Enter Sandman\" – 5:37 # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" – 2:19 Japanese 2-track 3-inch CD single # \"Enter Sandman\" # \"Stone Cold Crazy\" ==Personnel== Personnel adapted from Metallica liner notes, except where noted. ;Metallica *James Hetfield – guitars, vocals, production *Lars Ulrich – drums, production *Kirk Hammett – lead guitar *Jason Newsted – bass ;Additional Personnel *Bob Rock's son – child talking *Bob Rock – producer *Randy Staub – engineer *Mike Tacci – assistant engineer ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1991 songs Category:Metallica songs Category:Weezer songs Category:Hard rock songs Category:Heavy metal",
