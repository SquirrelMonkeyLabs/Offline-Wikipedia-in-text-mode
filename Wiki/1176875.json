Traditional Meitei toy versions of vehicles or Kangpots, like carts, chariots, are popular toys that kids love to play with.

This activity often takes place in open areas where wind conditions are suitable for Telanga flying. === Yubi (Coconut) === Players use a slippery, oiled coconut (, yubi) as a ball in the Meitei traditional game of Yubi Laakpi (), literally meaning \"coconut snatching\". The coconut is hard to hold because it is smooth and oily, making the game more difficult. Players try to pass, carry it, but it often slips or bounces in unexpected ways, making the game more fun and challenging. This is common in rural areas or during festivals. == In mythology and folklore == === Khoriphaba's toys === In the ancient Meitei mythology of God Khoriphaba, he cried nonstop when his mother Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi was not coming to him for a long time. He was gifted multiple precious toys, such as golden horse, golden peacock, golden tortoise, among many, by many gods, to stop him from crying. === Story of Ita Laiphadibee === There is a popular Meitei story called \"Ita Laiphadibee\" about a young girl who was very close to her laiphadibi (doll). When she grew up and had to marry, both she and her laiphadibi felt sad. As a gift for her love, the laiphadibi gave her the ability to understand animals' language. On her wedding night, the girl heard a fox talking about a dead man with a magic ring that would bring good luck. She went to find the body, not knowing her husband was following her. After struggling, she managed to get the ring off, but her husband thought she was a witch and reported her to the king. At court, the king asked what a crow was saying, and the girl replied that there was treasure under the tree, which was true. The king married her, made her queen, and the kingdom became prosperous. The story teaches that laiphadibis care for their human friends and can bring good fortune if treated well. === Laiphadibi's protection === According to legends, if traditional Meitei dolls, called laiphadibis, are placed at the entrance of a home, they protect the people inside and bring them good fortune. This belief comes from the ancient Meitei mythology about the goddess Panthoibi. The story says that evil spirits tried to enter the goddess's house to kidnap a family member, but a figure that looked like both a human and a god stopped them at the entrance. The spirits were scared and ran away. The laiphadibi had scared them off and kept the family safe. Because of this, people believe the laiphadibi protects homes, even when no one is there. == In market == In addition to regular markets like that of the Ima Market, playthings are also sold at Meitei festivals like Meitei Cheiraoba (Meitei New Year), and Hindu festivals like Rath Yatra, Krishna Janmashtami, Radha Asthami, and Durga Puja.
