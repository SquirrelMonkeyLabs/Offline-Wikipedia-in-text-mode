Old Deuteronomy Jellicle, who is the choirmaster of the tribe, chooses one cat to ascend to the Heaviside layer to be reborn and return to a new life. Grizabella Jellicle, an elderly (younger in some productions) glamour cat who left the junkyard, comes back to her tribe, but they shun her. While the other cats dance at the Jellicle Ball, Grizabella watches in the background. She performs a simple dance when the other cats leave and sings about how she wants to be accepted. Old Deutoronomy sees this and sympathizes with her. In act two, Old Deuteronomy gets kidnapped by Macavity Jellicle, a mystery cat who is the only true antagonist in the musical. As soon as he is successfully returned, it is time to choose who goes to the Heaviside layer. Grizabella is chosen, and she is taken on a tire to fly into the Heaviside layer.
