 "text": "In the United States, a governor is the chief executive officer and commander- in-chief in each of the fifty states and in the five permanently territories. Governors are responsible for passing state laws and the operation of the state executive branch. As state leaders, governors support and push for new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools, such as through executive orders, executive budgets, and legislative proposals and vetoes. Governors are comparable to the President, but on a state level. A majority of governors have the authority to appoint state court judges as well, in most cases from a list of names submitted by a nominations committee. ==References== Category:State governors of the United States Category:State government in the United States",
