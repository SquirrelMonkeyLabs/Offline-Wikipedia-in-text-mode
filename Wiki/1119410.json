 "text": "Haystack Rock is a sea stack in Cannon Beach, northern Oregon. It is the tallest intertidal monolithic rock in the United States. It was named Haystack Rock, because its shape resembles a hay stack. It is next to the beach and accessible by foot at low tide. The Haystack Rock tide pools are home to many intertidal animals, including starfish, sea anemone, crabs, chitons, limpets, and sea slugs. The rock is also a nesting site for many sea birds, including terns and puffins. It is a popular tourist destination on the Oregon Coast. The monolith served as a backdrop for the 1985 adventure movie The Goonies and for the 1990 action comedy movie Kindergarten Cop. == Other websites == * Friends of Haystack Rock * Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge Category:Rock formations Category:Geography of Oregon",
