Down the road at the side of the Institute (Village Hall) on the right hand side is a field called Lamblaires and in the north west corner is the place where the witches were strangled and then burned at the stake. ==References== == Other websites == * Overview of Crook of Devon Category:Villages in Scotland Category:Perth and Kinross",
