Granville Street is known for being a shopping and entertainment district with both the Granville Entertainment District and Granville Mall located along it. Granville Street was known as Theatre Row during its early years because of the many theatres that ran along it. It also had other places of entertainment such as arcades, night clubs, and pornography stores. Many have since closed after 2010 because of gentrification due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
