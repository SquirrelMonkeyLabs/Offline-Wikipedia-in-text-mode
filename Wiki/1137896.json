 "text": "Hyloxalus patitae is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== Scientists found this frog in exactly one place between 210 and 800 meters above sea level, but they think it might live in other places too. They saw it in rainforests with caves, streams, and waterfalls that the frogs could live near. Scientists think the frog might live in Reserva Comunal El Sira. This is a place where humans who have lived near there for thousands of years live, not a protected animal park. ==Reproduction== Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on the ground, but they have not seen female Hyloxalus patitae do this. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to water, for example water in the trunk of a dead tree. Scientists saw a male frog with tadpoles on his back. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is dying out. They think people cutting down trees to get wood to build with and to make room for cows to eat grass could hurt the frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
