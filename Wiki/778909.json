 "text": "Steptoe and Son is a British comedy series that was first aired on UK TV between 1962 and 1965 and then again between 1970 and 1974. There are 57 episodes. It was made into 8 series or seasons. The programme is about the intergenerational relationship between a rag and bone man and his son. == Story == The father, set in his grimy ways, and often described by his son as a 'dirty old man', is the opposite in character to his son, who is aspirational but pretentious. Harold, played by Harry H Corbett, the younger man of the two, has ideas of bettering himself but his dreams are often ridiculed or dashed by his dependent father, Albert, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The show has its roots in a 1962 episode of Galton and Simpson's Comedy Playhouse. Ray Galton and Alan Simpson went on to write all episodes of the series and two movies based on the series, Stepson and Son (1972) and its sequel Steptoe and Son Rides Again (1973). == References == Category:British comedy television series Category:English-language television programs",
