 "text": "The Hyundai Stellar is a large family car made by the Hyundai Motor Company. It was produced from July 1983 to 1992. The Stellar was made to replace the Ford Cortina, which Hyundai had built under license. The car was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. It used a rear-wheel drive chassis from the Ford Cortina Mark V and had an engine and transmission licensed from Mitsubishi Motors. == History and Features == The Hyundai Stellar was introduced in 1983 and was made until 1992. It came with different engine options, such as 1.4 L, 1.6 L, and 2.0 L engines. The car was available with both manual and automatic transmissions. In 1987, the Stellar was updated and became the Stellar II. This new version had a better 2.0 L engine, new headlights, and suspension. It also received larger brakes and a two-piece driveshaft. == Markets == The Hyundai Stellar was sold in many countries, including Europe, Canada, and South Korea. It was sold in the UK from 1984 until 1991. In Canada, it was sold until 1992. The Stellar was Hyundaiâ€™s second model to be sold in Europe, after the Hyundai Pony. In the United States, the Stellar was not sold because it did not meet the country's strict emission standards. However, it was still available in other countries like Canada and some European markets. == Discontinuation == The Hyundai Stellar was replaced by the Hyundai Sonata in 1992 in many markets, including Canada and Europe. In South Korea, the lower models of the Stellar were also replaced by the Sonata. The Stellar was the last rear-wheel drive car made by Hyundai in North America. After the Hyundai Genesis in 2009, Hyundai stopped making rear-wheel drive cars for the North American market. == References == Stellar Category:1980s automobiles Category:1990s automobiles",
