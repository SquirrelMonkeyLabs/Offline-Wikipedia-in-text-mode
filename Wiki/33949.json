 "text": "Straight edge (Often called sXe) is a lifestyle without drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Some followers of straight edge also abstain from illegal or casual sex. For some, no drug use includes caffeine which is a stimulant drug. Some will accept drugs such as codeine or morphine for medical reasons. Some followers of straight edge will not use Ny-Quil or Day-Quil because they contain alcohol. Those straight edgers who quit casual or illegal sex would not have one-night stands and will wait until they are in a committed relationship to have sex. Some cities have associated straight edge as gang affiliation, but advocates call it a way of life such as being a vegetarian. ==References== Category:Subculture Category:Lifestyles",
