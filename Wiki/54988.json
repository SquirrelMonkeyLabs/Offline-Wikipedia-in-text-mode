 "text": "Ahmed Yassin (Arabic: الشيخُ أَحْمَدُ إِسْمَاعِيلُ) (June 1936 – March 22, 2004) was a spiritual leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas. == Life == Ahmed Yassin was born on June 1936 in al-Jura, British Mandate of Palestine. He helped create Hamas and became its spiritual leader in 1987. To other members of Hamas he was a hero but he was blamed by the Israeli government for planning suicide bombings and other attacks against Israel. He claimed that was the only way of fighting occupation. He was confined to a wheelchair because he was paralyzed since age 12, he was also nearly blind and could barely hear. He was very powerful and influential. Yassin's birth date is in dispute. He claimed he was born 1/1/1938, however, his passport indicated 1/1/1937. To some he was a hero, to some he was a well known member of a terrorist organization. He was also a symbolic figure for Palestinians to fight against Israel. == Death == Yassin was killed in an airstrike in Gaza City by the Israeli Army after he left a mosque in Gaza in the early morning hours. He was 67 years old. ==References== == Other websites == * Israel Bombing of Refugee Camp * Yassin killed, Ahmed Yassin biography * Yassin's letter and kids named after him Category:1937 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Deaths by Israeli airstrikes Category:Hamas Category:Assassinated Palestinian people Category:Palestinian Muslims Category:Palestinian nationalists Category:Palestinian militants Category:Hamas people",
