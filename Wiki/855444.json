 "text": "In British politics, the Shadow Home Secretary (officially known as the Shadow Secretary of State for the Home Department), is the person in the shadow cabinet who shadows the Home Secretary. This mostly means criticising government policy on home affairs including policing, national security, the criminal justice system, the prison service, and stuff to do with citizenship. If the opposition party is elected to government, the Shadow Home Secretary usually becomes the new Home Secretary, but this doesn't always happen and isn't required. The person who is currently Shadow Home Secretary is the Conservative MP Chris Philp since 5 November 2024. == References == Category:Politics of the United Kingdom",
