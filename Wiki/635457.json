 "text": "The temptation of Christ is detailed in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. After His baptism, Jesus went into the desert where he didn't eat for 40 days. Then He was temped by Satan who told him to change stones into bread. Jesus didn't do it even though he must have been hungry. He said that Man does not live by bread alone, but by the words that come from the Father's (God's) mouth. The devil then told Jesus to jump off the highest part of the Temple to show his power, since the Bible said that God would send angels to save Him. Jesus replied that the Bible also says not to \"test the Lord your God\". Then the Devil offered to give Jesus all of the World's kingdoms if Jesus would worship him. Jesus replied that we should worship only God. All three temptations are recorded in each of the three Synoptic Gospels. But the order in which they were told is different between the accounts. Some scholars think the Gospel authors chose the order of the three temptations to make a particular point, not just because they were careless in telling the story. ==References== Category:Gospels Category:Jesus",
