 "text": "Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (also called the BCG vaccine) is a vaccine against tuberculosis. The vaccine is based on a bovine strain of the bacterium. The BCG vaccine was first used medically in 1921. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2004, the vaccine is given to about 100 million children per year globally. However, it is not commonly administered in the United States. It looks like the vaccine can also be used to treat certain forms of bladder cancer.De Jager R, Guinan P, Lamm D, u. a.: Long-term complete remission in bladder carcinoma in situ with intravesical TICE bacillus Calmette Guerin.
