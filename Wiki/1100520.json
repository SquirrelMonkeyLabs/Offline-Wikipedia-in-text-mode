Oman and the United Arab Emirates were greatly affected, 24 people died in these floods, 18 of them in Oman, 1 in UAE and 5 in other countries. Other Arab countries such as Bahrain, Qatar, Southeastern Iran, Yemen and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, also faced heavy rainfall and flooding. ==Impact== ===Oman=== In Oman, floods killed 18 people, including 10 school children and their driver, whose vehicle was washed away. ===UAE=== In the UAE, there was record-breaking rainfall, the highest since records began in 1949. Flooding was widespread, and a 70-year-old man died after he was swept away with his car during the flood. Landslides were also reported in some areas. Dubai Metro services were badly impacted. It's services were stopped, leaving around 200 commuters left alone at different stations. 17 flights from Dubai International Airport were cancelled on April 16, with operations being temporarily suspended for around 25 minutes. ===Bahrain=== Bahrain experienced heavy rainfall and thunderstorms.
