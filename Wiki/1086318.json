 "text": "Robert F. \"Toby\" Fox (born October 11, 1991) is an American video game developer and composer. He made Undertale, which people have named for awards. He also made Deltarune. When Fox started, he made music for Homestuck. After making Undertale, he also made music for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Pokémon. He has collaborated with, or worked with, many people, like the VTuber Houshou Marine. He has also collaborated with Camellia, who makes music too. ==Career== Toby Fox made the \"EarthBound Halloween Hack\", a Halloween- themed ROM hack of EarthBound. It is the earliest thing people know him for. He then made music for the Homestuck during his senior year of high school. Fox has also made music for the 2017 video game Hiveswap, a short story game called Escaped Chasm, and the RPG Little Town Hero, which was arranged by Hitomi Sato. He also made a song for Pokémon Sword and Shield, a song for Itoki Hana's PRAY album, and many songs for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. === Undertale === The most known work by Fox is the role-playing video game Undertale. The game sold more than 1 million copies. Fox made the game by himself, except for the art, which he asked Temmie Chang to help with. He had some experience in game making before Undertale because he used RPG Maker 2000 with his three brothers to make games and other versions of games. He thought of the characters and ideas for Undertale while in college, and he drew them in his notebook. After its release, Undertale had a big fanbase. Fox said that he did not care if people said that they did not like the game, saying that it was \"not for everyone\". === Deltarune === On October 30, 2018, Fox said that Undertale fans should check the game's Twitter account in a day. The next day, Fox shared the first chapter of another story with Undertale characters, named Deltarune, (which is \"Undertale\" with the letters mixed up) for free, saying it was a \"survey\". == Personal life == Robert F. Fox was born on October 11, 1991, in Manchester, New Hampshire. He is the son of Robert Fox and Barbara Fox. He learned about environmental science at Northeastern University. Fox likes to keep things secret and does not do interviews most of the time. He has pain in his wrist that can slow him from making code and making music. ==References== Category:Video game composers Category:Living people Category:1991 births Category:American video game designers Category:American composers Category:Writers from New Hampshire Category:People from Manchester, New Hampshire",
