 "text": "Euclidean space is the space Euclidean geometry uses. In essence, it is described in Euclid's Elements. The Euclidean plane (\\mathbb{R}^2) and three- dimensional space (\\mathbb{R}^3) are part of Euclidean space, which can be generalized to any dimension n (in which case one writes \\mathbb{R}^n). Euclidean space is sometimes called Cartesian space. A few other spaces and mathematical objects that are similar were added later. Euclid based his work Elements on certain axioms. Euclidean space can be described using such axioms. == Related pages == * Elliptic geometry * Hyperbolic geometry ==References== ==Other websites== * Euclidean Space and Metric Spaces Category:Geometry",
