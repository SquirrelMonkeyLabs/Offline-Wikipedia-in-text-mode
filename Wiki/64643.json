 "text": "Ali ibn Abi Talib (‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib) () (Approximately March 17, 599 – January 28, 661) was an early Islamic leader. He was the fourth Sunni caliph and the first Shia Imam. Ali was Muhammad's cousin. He married Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, so Ali became Muhammad's son-in-law. He was one of the earliest Muslims. Since Ali stated that his body should remain a secret, his followers tied his body on a white camel, and went towards northern Afghanistan. Before being assassinated, Ali had reportedly given instructions to bury his body at the spot where the camel would die. At Balkh, the white camel died and Ali was buried secretly. In the 15th century, Abd al-Ghafur Lari is believed to discover Ali's tomb. * * == Other websites == === Sunni biography === * Biography from USC's MSA website === Shi'a biography === * Brief Biography * Ali's Birth in the Kaaba * Website devoted to the Life of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib * Sayings of Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib * Imam Ali Quotes on various topics * Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib * Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib The Commander of the Faithfull * Imam Ali foundation * Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Nahjul Balagha * Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib's status * Imam Ali * Last will == References == Category:599 births Category:661 deaths Category:Caliphs Category:Imams Category:Shia Islam",
