 "text": "Project 2025 is a plan created by The Heritage Foundation for the 47th president of the United States of America. It does not endorse one presidential candidate over another. The people who wrote it are connected to Trump. It wants to bring more conservative ideas to the presidency. == Background == The Heritage Foundation has made similar plans before other presidencies. They have made a Mandate for Leadership since 1981, updating it with presidential campaigns. == Content == There are four main issues targeted by Project 2025: # Put family first and protect our children. # Let American people govern themselves. # Defend America's independence against other countries. # Defend American rights to live freely. There are many things that Project 2025 wants to add to the government: * The President should control less parts of the government. * Government workers should be replaced with people who agree with the President's ideas. * More Christian ideas should be part of government decisions. * Taxes should be lower, with big cuts for high earners and companies. * Rules should be stricter for people entering the country without permission. * Programs about climate change should end. * There should be more support for oil and gas drilling. * States should have more control over schools than the federal government. * There should be more limits on abortion. * There should be more limits on transgender healthcare. * The way reporters work at the White House should change. * Punishments for crimes should be stronger. * Remove the Department of Education. * Make education more Christian (adding private school vouchers). * Make it easier to punish unions and union workers. Supporters of this plan say it will fix big problems. They think it will make America stronger and better. They want to implement the plan over the first 180 days of the President's time in the White House. == Controversy == People also say Project 2025 has many problems. They believe these changes would be so big and negative that America might not feel like a great country anymore. Many people accuse Trump of heading the project, saying that he will use it to turn himself into a dictator. They believe it will give him too much power. Others believe he is not heading the project, but it would still give him too much power. People think that the mixing of church ideas with government will be unfair to people of different faiths. It may make everyone use the same Christian view of the world. This will also make the government ignore some people's rights, including women, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities. People believe that they should have access to abortions, transgender healthcare, and the ability to immigrate to America. Project 2025 removes those rights. They also believe that it will hurt the environment. They believe it will increase carbon emissions and contribute to climate change. It also removes past rules that protect certain areas and keeps them safe from people wanting to use them to make money. There are also worry about its impacts on education. The removal of the Department of Education would leave people unsafe in school. The cuts to education funding and adding of private school vouchers would make it difficult for public school teachers to teach people. Project 2025 also encourages censorship in the classroom while adding more Christian things to the classroom. It will also weaken the power of unions and educators and make their jobs challenging. Trump has denied involvement in Project 2025. He says he supports only certain parts of it.The former director of Project 2025 has also denied Trump's involvement. == References == Category:Politics of the United States Category:2024 United States presidential election Category:Donald Trump",
