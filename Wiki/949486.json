 "text": "The Baja chorus frog, Baja California tree frog, or Baja California chorus frog (Pseudacris hypochondriaca) is a frog. It lives in the United States and Mexico. It lives in California, Arizona, Nevada, and Baja California. Some scientists think this is the same species as Pseudacris regilla but other scientists do not. In 2006, a team of scientists led by Recuero studied the mitochondrial DNA of frogs called Pseudacris regilla and decided that they should be considered three species: Pseudacris regilla in northern California, Pseudacris sierra in southern California, and Pseudacris hypochondriaca in Baja California. But other scientists say Recuero did not collect enough information. In 2016, another team of scientists, Duellman, Marion, and Hedges, said that this frog should be in the genus Hyliola instead of the genus Pseudacris. There are two subspecies of this frog: Pseudacris regilla curta is called the Cape St. Lucas tree frog, California Pacific tree frog, San Lucas Chorus tree frog, and San Lucas chorus frog. Pseudacris hypochondriaca hypochondriaca is called the San Lucan tree frog and Northern Baja California tree frog. Pseudacris regilla deserticola is called the desert tree frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
