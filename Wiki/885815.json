At Kurt Huberâ€™s trial on April 19, 1943, Professor Huber, as well as Willi Graf and Alexander Schmorell, were sentenced to death. (Sophie, Hans, and Christoph had already been put to death on February 22, 1943.) Kurt Huber was executed on July 13, 1943. After his death the sixth pamphlet, which Huber wrote almost exclusively, was smuggled into Great Britain, where it was copied en masse and thrown down on Germany from Allied Planes in July 1943. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Executed German people Category:World War II resistance members",
