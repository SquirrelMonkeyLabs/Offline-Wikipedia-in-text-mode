 "text": "Issyk-Kul (also Ysyk-KÃ¶l, is an endorheic saline lake in the western Tianshan Mountains in eastern Kyrgyzstan. It is just south of a dividing range separating Kyrgyzstan from Kazakhstan. It is the seventh-deepest lake in the world, the tenth-biggest lake in the world by volume (though not in surface area) and the third-biggest saline lake. Issyk-Kul means \"warm lake\" in the Kyrgyz language. This is because even though the area it is in gets very cold during winter, the salinity of the lake makes it rarely freeze. The lake is a Ramsar site of globally significant biodiversity.Ramsar Site RDB Code 2KG001 It is also part of the Issyk-Kul Biosphere Reserve. ==References== Category:Lakes of Asia Category:Geography of Kyrgyzstan",
