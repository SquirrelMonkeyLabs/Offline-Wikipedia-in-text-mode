 "text": "The 2022–23 Premier League was the 31st season of the Premier League. It was the 124th season of top-level football in England. Some new teams joined this season, including Fulham, Bournemouth, and Nottingham Forest. They replaced Burnley, Watford, and Norwich City. Manchester City became champions of the league for the third time in a row on May 20th after Arsenal lost to Nottingham Forest. This made Manchester City the second team after their local rivals Manchester United to win three titles in a row in the Premier League era. Manchester City has won a total of nine English titles and seven since 1992. On the other hand, Arsenal spent the most days at the top of the league without winning the title in the history of English top-level football. This season is special because all three teams that were promoted at the beginning of the season managed to avoid getting relegation. This hadn't happened since the 2017-18 season. Even the team that was in last place at Christmas, Wolverhampton Wanderers, managed to avoid getting relegated, which hadn't happened since the 2014-15 season. For the second year in a row, more than 15 million fans went to watch the matches, setting a new record with a total of 15,289,340 spectators attending the games. Erling Haaland scored the most goals by a player in a single season, with 36 goals. == Season summary == The season started well for Arsenal with five games without losing. But they lost to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Manchester City did a good job from the beginning, signing Erling Haaland as a striker. They went nine games without losing until Liverpool beat them in October. Arsenal led the league for a while and were five points ahead of Manchester City by March. But a series of three draws let Manchester City catch up, and when they won 4-1 against another team, they took the lead. Manchester City won the league when Arsenal lost 1-0 to Nottingham Forest on May 20, 2023. They got the trophy on May 21, 2023. Manchester United, led by Erik ten Hag in his first season as manager, got back to the Champions League and won the Carabao Cup. After 20 years, Newcastle United made it to the Champions League, which was a big deal. Liverpool had a tough season and ended 5th, missing out on the Champions League for the first time since 2015-16. But they had a huge 7-0 win over Manchester United on March 5, 2023. Chelsea spent lots on new players under new owners, but they had a bad season. They finished lower in the table, changed managers twice, and ended up 12th – their worst in ages. Brighton & Hove Albion lost their manager to Chelsea, but the new one helped them finish 6th. Aston Villa got into European football for the first time since 2009-10. They changed managers and improved in the second half of the season to finish 7th. Tottenham Hotspur had a strange season. Their manager left, they had temporary managers, and finished 8th. Bournemouth, expected to go down, surprised and stayed up. Nottingham Forest made loads of new signings and stayed safe with big wins. Another promoted team, Fulham, did well and finished 10th. Southampton got relegated first. On the last day of the season, Everton, Leeds United, and Leicester City were at risk of relegation. Leeds and Leicester went down, but Everton survived. Everton staying up meant their long run in the top division continues.Everton beat Bournemouth to save themselves from relegation === Notable events and breaks === On September 9, 2022, all Premier League matches planned for September 10-12 were postponed as a sign of respect for Queen Elizabeth II, who had died. The next week, three Premier League matches set for September 17-18 were also postponed because of issues with policing connected to Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on September 19. Additionally, in that same week, the Arsenal match against Manchester City, originally planned for October 19, was moved to a later date to make room for Arsenal's Europa League match with PSV Eindhoven, which was itself postponed from September 15 to October 20. There was a break in the middle of the season because of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The last matches before the break happened on November 12-13, 2022, and the first matches after the World Cup were played on December 26, 2022, after the World Cup final on December 18, 2022. == Stadiums and locations == : Note: Table lists in alphabetical order.
