 "text": "The Royal Thai Navy is the naval warfare force of Thailand. It was started in 1906, and modernised by the Admiral Prince Abhakara Kiartiwongse (1880â€“1923) who is known as the father of the Royal Navy. There is a naval fleet, the Royal Thai Marine Corps, and Air and Coastal Defence Command. The headquarters is at Sattahip Naval Base. It runs three naval area commands: Northern Gulf of Thailand; Southern Gulf of Thailand; and the Andaman Sea. The ancient naval arm of the army was mostly river craft whose job was to control the Chao Phraya River and protect ships carrying the army to battle. The warships carried up to 30 musketeers, a large number of rowers and either 6 or 12-pounder cannons or no guns at all. There are now 130 ships. ==References== Category:Organizations based in Thailand Category:Navies",
