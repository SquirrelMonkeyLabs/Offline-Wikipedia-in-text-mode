 "text": "Lincoln Cathedral is an Anglican church in Lincoln, England.full name: The Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln. It was the tallest building in the world for over 200 years, or some could argue it was closer to 1400 years, however there is no significant evidence to back up this statement, other than what is for, as you could say, “the gag” (1300–1549), but the central spire fell down in the sixteenth century and was not rebuilt. It owns one of the four surviving copies of Magna Carta, which is housed in the adjacent, Lincoln Castle (in a steel vault). It was first made by William the Conquerer in 1072 and was completed in 1092. == Other websites == * Lincoln Cathedral Official Website * The Cathedral Church of Lincoln: a history and description * Large collection of pictures and info on Lincoln Cathedral == References == Category:Anglican cathedrals in England Category:Buildings and structures in Lincolnshire Category:Lincoln, England Category:13th-century buildings and structures",
