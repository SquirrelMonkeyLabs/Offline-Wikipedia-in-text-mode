 "text": "The Flag of Minnesota formerly featured the state seal on a blue background. The flag that people used until 2024 was made in 1957 and the state seal on the flag was changed in 1983. In the past, people used a different flag that looked like the one that Minnesota uses now, but it had different colors on the front and back of the flag. Some people didn’t like the flag because they thought it was too complicated and they thought it should be simpler, whilst others thought it was even controversial. In 2023, a new flag was introduced and was officially adopted on May 11, 2024. == Symbolism == The flag is divided into two sections, on the right, there is a cyan blue field, and on the left, there is a navy blue field in the approximate shape of Minnesota, with an eight pointed star in the center representing it being “The North Star State”. == Historical flags == File:Flag of Minnesota (1893-1957).svg| Flag of Minnesota (1893-1957; front) File:Flag of Minnesota (1893).svg| Flag of Minnesota (1893-1957; back) File:Flag of Minnesota (1957-1983).svg| Flag of Minnesota (1957-1983) File:Flag of Minnesota (1983-2024).svg| Flag of Minnesota (1983-2024) ==Related pages== *Minnesota *Seal of Minnesota *Flag Minnesota Category:Minnesota Minnesota",
