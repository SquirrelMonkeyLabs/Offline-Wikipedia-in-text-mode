 "text": "Brothers of Italy (, ; FdI) is a right-wing political party in Italy. It is led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who became Italy's first female Prime Minister after the party won the 2022 general election. It is part of the Centre-right coalition. It is named after the first line of the Italian national anthem, Il Canto degli Italiani. The party's logo is a tri-color flame in the colours of the Italian flag which was originally the logo of the post war neo-fascist, Italian Social Movement (MSI) Party. Meloni and other party members describe the party as being \"mainstream conservative\". It has been described as national conservative, right-wing populist, social conservative and nationalist. The party is also Eurosceptic (anti-European Union), but also Atlantist (pro-NATO). The party is against abortion, euthanasia, same-sex marriage and high levels of immigration. The party used to have links to the far-right and neofascist movements, though the party says they are not far-right, fascist or neo-Nazi. The party once supported closer ties with Russia, but after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the party has condemned Russia and supported Ukraine. ==References== Category:Political parties in Italy",
