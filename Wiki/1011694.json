 "text": "Kepler-69 (also known as KOI-172, 2MASS J19330262+4452080 and KIC 8692861) is a G-type main sequence star that is similar to the Sun. It is located about 2,430 light years away from the Earth in the constellation Cygnus. It has a radius of 0.93 times smaller than the Sun. On April 18, 2013, it was announced that two exoplanets were found orbiting this star, but further studies have shown that the terrestrial planet Kepler-69c is not in the habitable zone and is more like Venus than Earth, making it a lifeless planet. ==References== Category:Stars",
