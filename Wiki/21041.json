 "text": "The y-intercept of a line on a graph is where the line touches (or intercepts) the y-axis (the numbered line going straight up). The equation for straight lines is y=mx+b. \"b\" is the y-intercept. You can find the y-intercept of a graph by seeing where the x-coordinate equals 0. The y-coordinate of a point with a x-coordinate of 0 is the y-intercept. ==Related pages== * Algebra Category:Algebra Category:Functions and mappings",
