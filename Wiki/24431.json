 "text": "Apple sauce (or applesauce) is a sauce made from stewed and mashed apples. Peeled or unpeeled apples can be used and different spices or additives like cinnamon can be used. Sugar or high fructose corn syrup is often added to the applesauce to sweeten it. Applesauce can be fine or coarse textured, and can include large pieces of apple. It is easy to make at home, and it is also sold ready-made in supermarkets. It is a common food or snack for children and people who have problems eating solid food. Parents often feed it to their babies because teeth are not needed to eat it. In the United Kingdom, apple sauce is normally used as a sauce for ham, pork, and gammon. ==Use and availability== Apple sauce was once a food prepared for winter, since it keeps well. Apple sauce can be used in baking as a substitute for fat (such as butter or oil) or eggs. ==References== Category:Apple dishes Category:Apple products Category:Sauces",
