 "text": "Ministry, in Christianity, is the activity that is done by members of the church to serve the purposes of the church. It can mean this activity as a whole, or specific activities, or organizations in a church that perform specific activities. ==Age-specific Ministry == As churches attempt to meet the needs of their congregations, they often separate their members into groups according to age categories. Age-specific groups meet for religious study including Sunday school programs, fellowship, and other activities. These age divisions may include: *Nursery *Pre-school *Children, generally elementary age students *Youth, generally middle and high school students *College and career, designed for university-age students *Adults, which is often broken up into single adults, couples ministry, men's and women's ministries, and senior adults. Nearly all churches have some form of worship music, whether from a choir, orchestra, or worship band. ==Service and outreach== Many churches sponsor ministries designed to reach out others on a local and global scale, usually grouped under the heading of missions. There are many organizations which perform missions on a fully-funded and organized level, such as North American Mission Board, operated by the Southern Baptist Convention. ==Related pages== *Christianity *Sermon Category:Church organization Category:Christian behavior and experience",
