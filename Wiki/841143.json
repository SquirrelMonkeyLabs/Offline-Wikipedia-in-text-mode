 "text": "Washi (和紙) is a traditional Japanese paper. The term is used to describe paper that uses local fiber, processed by hand and made in the traditional way. Washi is made with fibers from the inner bark of the gampi tree, the mitsumata shrub, or the paper mulberry bush. As a Japanese craft, it is registered as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage. Washi is tougher than ordinary paper made from wood pulp. It is used in many traditional arts. Origami, Shodo, and Ukiyo-e were all produced using washi. Washi was also used to make many goods like clothes, household goods, and toys. It was even used to make wreaths that were given to winners in the 1998 Winter Paralympics. ==References== Category:Japanese paper",
