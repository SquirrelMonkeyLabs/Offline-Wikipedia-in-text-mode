 "text": "\"Strap Me In\" is a 1987 song by The Cars, appearing on their sixth studio album Door to Door. ==Music video== Like its predecessor, \"You Are the Girl\", a music video was produced for \"Strap Me In\". The video showed the band playing in a barren wasteland while a couple fought. It was also the final video the Cars made before they broke up, with the next video being made for \"Sad Song\" in 2011. ==Release and reception== \"Strap Me In\" was first released on the Door to Door album in August 1987, opening the second side of the album. In September 1987, \"Strap Me In\" also saw a single release in America (as well as in Japan, Germany, and Australia) as the follow-up to the top- twenty single \"You Are the Girl.\" However, it failed to reach the chart success of its predecessor, only managing to peak at number 85 on the Billboard Hot 100, although it peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. A follow-up single, \"Coming Up You\" performed marginally better, peaking at number 74 in the US. \"Strap Me In\" was mentioned in the Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology liner notes as the \"standout track\" from Door to Door, which also said, \"'Strap Me In' proved that [Ric] Ocasek could still turn an automotive double-entendre with the best of them.\" ==Charts== Chart performance for \"Strap Me In\" Chart (1987) Peak position US Cash Box Top 100 Singles 84 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:The Cars songs Category:1987 songs",
