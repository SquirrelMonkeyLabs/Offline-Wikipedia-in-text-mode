 "text": "The Premier of Victoria is the head of the Government of Victoria, Australia. The Premier does the same job at a state level as the Prime Minister of Australia does at a national level. Formal power is held by the King who is represented in Victoria by the Governor of Victoria. The Governor acts on the advice given to him by the Premier. The current Premier of Victoria is Jacinta Allan. Victoria is governed under the Westminster system of parliamentary government. It is a bicameral system with two elected houses. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly and the upper house is called the Legislative Council. After an election, the State Governor appoints as Premier, the leader of the party who can control a majority of the elected members in the lower house. The Premier must resign if they no longer have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. This can happen if they lose seats at an election, or if their own political party does not support them. Victoria was a British colony, and power was held by the Governor. In 1855, Britain allowed Victoria to have its own parliament, and the power was passed to the Premier. ==List of Premiers of Victoria== No. Name Party Assumed office Left office 1 William Haines 30 November 1855 11 March 1857 2 Sir John O'Shanassy 11 March 1857 29 April 1857 \\- William Haines 29 April 1857 10 March 1858 \\- Sir John O'Shanassy 10 March 1858 27 October 1859 3 William Nicholson 27 October 1859 26 November 1860 4 Richard Heales 26 November 1860 14 November 1861 \\- Sir John O'Shanassy 14 November 1861 27 June 1863 5 Sir James McCulloch 27 June 1863 6 May 1868 6 Sir Charles Sladen 6 May 1868 11 July 1868 7 John Alexander MacPherson 20 September 1869 9 April 1870 \\- Sir James McCulloch 9 April 1870 19 June 1871 8 Charles Gavan Duffy 19 June 1871 10 June 1872 9 James Francis 10 June 1872 31 July 1874 10 George Kerferd 31 July 1874 7 August 1875 11 Sir Graham Berry 7 August 1875 20 October 1875 \\- Sir James McCulloch 20 October 1875 21 May 1877 \\- Sir Graham Berry 21 May 1877 5 March 1880 12 James Service 5 March 1880 3 August 1880 \\- Sir Graham Berry 3 August 1880 9 July 1881 13 Sir Bryan O'Loghlen 9 July 1881 8 March 1883 \\- James Service 8 March 1883 18 February 1886 14 Duncan Gillies Conservative-Liberal Coalition 18 February 1886 5 November 1890 15 James Munro National Liberal 5 November 1890 16 February 1892 16 William Shiels Liberal 16 February 1892 23 January 1893 17 Sir James Patterson Conservative 23 January 1893 27 September 1894 18 Sir George Turner Liberal 27 September 1894 5 December 1899 19 Allan McLean Liberal 5 December 1899 19 November 1900 \\- Sir George Turner Liberal 19 November 1900 12 February 1901 20 Sir Alexander Peacock Liberal 12 February 1901 10 June 1902 21 Sir William Irvine Reform 10 June 1902 16 February 1904 22 Sir Thomas Bent Reform 16 February 1904 8 January 1909 23 John Murray Liberal 8 January 1909 18 May 1912 24 William Watt Liberal 18 May 1912 9 December 1913 25 George Elmslie Labor 9 December 1913 22 December 1913 \\- William Watt Liberal 22 December 1913 18 June 1914 \\- Sir Alexander Peacock Liberal 18 June 1914 29 November 1917 26 John Bowser Nationalist 29 November 1917 21 March 1918 27 Sir Harry Lawson Nationalist 21 March 1918 7 September 1923 \\- Sir Harry Lawson Nationalist/ Country 7 September 1923 19 March 1924 \\- Sir Harry Lawson Nationalist 19 March 1924 28 April 1924 \\- Sir Alexander Peacock Nationalist 28 April 1924 18 July 1924 28 George Prendergast Labor 18 July 1924 18 November 1924 29 John Allan Country/ Nationalist 18 November 1924 20 May 1927 30 Edmond Hogan Labor 20 May 1927 22 November 1928 31 Sir William McPherson Nationalist 22 November 1928 12 December 1929 \\- Edmond Hogan Labor 12 December 1929 19 May 1932 32 Sir Stanley Argyle United Australia 19 May 1932 2 April 1935 33 Sir Albert Dunstan Country 2 April 1935 14 September 1943 34 John Cain Snr Labor 14 September 1943 18 September 1943 \\- Sir Albert Dunstan Country 18 September 1943 2 October 1945 35 Ian MacFarlan Liberal 2 October 1945 21 November 1945 \\- John Cain Snr Labor 21 November 1945 20 November 1947 36 Thomas Hollway Liberal 20 November 1947 3 December 1948 \\- Thomas Hollway Liberal 3 December 1948 27 June 1950 37 Sir John McDonald Country 27 June 1950 28 October 1952 \\- Thomas Hollway Electoral Reform 28 October 1952 31 October 1952 \\- Sir John McDonald Country 31 October 1952 17 December 1952 \\- John Cain Snr Labor 17 December 1952 31 March 1955 \\- John Cain Snr Labor 31 March 1955 7 June 1955 38 Sir Henry Bolte Liberal 7 June 1955 23 August 1972 39 Sir Rupert Hamer Liberal 23 August 1972 5 June 1981 40 Lindsay Thompson Liberal 5 June 1981 8 April 1982 41 John Cain II Labor 8 April 1982 10 August 1990 42 Joan Kirner Labor 10 August 1990 6 October 1992 43 Jeff Kennett Liberal 6 October 1992 20 October 1999 44 Steve Bracks Labor 20 October 1999 30 July 2007 45 John Brumby Labor 30 July 2007 2 December 2010 46 Ted Baillieu Liberal 2 December 2010 6 March 2013 47 Denis Napthine Liberal 6 March 2013 4 December 2014 48 Daniel Andrews Labor 4 December 2014 27 September 2023 49 Jacinta Allan Labor 27 September 2023 Current Premier",
