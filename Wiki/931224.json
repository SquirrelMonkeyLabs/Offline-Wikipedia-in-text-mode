 "text": "Have a Laugh! is an American animated comedy series produced by the Walt Disney Company for the Disney Channel. The series is a set of interstitials, presenting edited versions of classic Mickey Mouse cartoons that lasted from 2009 to 2012. ==Plot== The series features short and long versions of Disney shorts. The short versions are re-voiced with current Disney voice actors such as Tony Anselmo (Donald Duck), Jim Cummings, Bill Farmer (Goofy), and Bret Iwan (Mickey Mouse). The show features Disney cartoons with the original opening and closing credits restored (if content has been removed, a stamp bearing the words \"Short Version\" appears on the title card). The series also features short subjects such as \"Disney's Re-Micks\" where they match classic Mickey Mouse cartoons and popular songs such as \"He Could Be the One\" by Miley Cyrus, similar to the 1980s D-TV series. ==Major characters== * Mickey Mouse (voiced by Bret Iwan) * Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie (voiced by Tony Anselmo) * Goofy, Pluto (voiced by Bill Farmer) * Minnie Mouse
