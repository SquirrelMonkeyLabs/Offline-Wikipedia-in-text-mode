 "text": "Landstraßer AC ( LAC for short) is an Austrian football club from the 3rd district of Vienna, Landstraße. The former second division team currently plays in the 2nd regional league of the Vienna Football Association. This is the 5th level in Austrian football. ==History== The Landstraßer AC was founded under the name “Athletik Club Training” by Anton Sandner in 1911. In 1918 the club renamed itself to Landstraßer Amateure. The club experienced its most successful time in the 1930s with later stars like Camillo Jerusalem in the team. In 1933 the club played in the professional second division for the first time and therefore decided to change the name Landstraßer Amateure to Landstraßer AC in 1936. After four seasons in the second division they were relegated to the third division. They were immediately promoted again in the following season. During the Second World War there was also a forced merger with the Demon and later a merger with the Delka (2nd league 1937-38) and FC Pfeil. At this time, the Landstraßer AC also had sections for gymnastics, athletics, bowling and boxing. The footballers were able to stay in the second league. In the first post-war season, Landstraßer AC immediately achieved its best result in the club's history. They finished third in the second division behind SC Hochstädt and Hakoah Wien. In 1948 the football club came third again, again only two points behind SCR Hochstädt and one point behind 1. Schwechater SC. 1949 there was a surprising relegation from the second division, to which Landstraßer AC could no longer return. Today, after a merger with IC Favoriten in 2010, the club finds itself in the fourth-tier Vienna City League under the name Landstrasser AC-IC. After the 2012/13 season they merged with SG Inter AGO and the club has since played as LAC-Inter in the Vienna Oberliga B. In the 2014/2015 season, the 2nd regional league was inserted between the Vienna City League and the Oberliga. LAC qualified thanks to its good placement .
