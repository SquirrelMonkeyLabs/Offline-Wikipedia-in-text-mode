 "text": "Comrade is the name given to someone who belongs to the same social group, party, or company. It literally means friend or colleague, but it also means ally. The term can refer to someone who has the same beliefs or values. That way, in Communism, people who belong to the Communist Party address each other as comrades. Example: \"You're right, comrade!\" Terms like this avoid using titles, rank, or any other sign that one person is better than, or different from, another. Category:Politics",
