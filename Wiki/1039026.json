 "text": "Bob Inger's bush frog (Raorchestes bobingeri) is a frog. It lives in India. People have seen it between 1030 and 1300 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that are growing back. People have seen it in places where the trees and shrubs are growing back after logging. Scientists believe this frog is in only some danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. The frog lives in three protected parks: Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, Ponmudi Reserve Forest and Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
