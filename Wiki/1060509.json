 "text": "The Rhode Island Red is an American breed of chicken. It is the state bird of Rhode Island. It was developed there and in Massachusetts in the late nineteenth century. It was developed by cross-breeding birds of Oriental origin such as the Malay with brown Leghorn birds from Italy. It was farmed for meat and eggs. Modern types have been bred for their eggs. The traditional non-industrial types of the Rhode Island Red are listed as \"watch\" (medium conservation priority, between \"recovering\" and \"threatened\") by The Livestock Conservancy. It is not the same breed as the Rhode Island White. ==References== Category:Chickens Category:Birds of the United States",
