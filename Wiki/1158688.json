 "text": "Mutual aid is when people work together to help each other with things they need. This could include: * sharing food, clothes or medicine * running breakfast programs * providing education * helping during emergencies like natural disasters or health crises == About mutual aid == Mutual aid is different from charity because: * there are no conditions on who can get help * everyone involved makes decisions together * people take responsibility for supporting each other * the aim is both to help people and to change the situations that created problems == How mutual aid works == === Working together === In mutual aid groups: * everyone can take part * there are no bosses or leaders * all members have equal power to make decisions * decisions are made by reaching agreement as a group === Types of support === Groups work together to: * identify what people need * find ways to meet those needs * share resources and skills * tackle the root causes of problems == History of mutual aid == The idea of mutual aid became well known through Peter Kropotkin's book 'Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution' in 1902. Kropotkin showed that working together, not competing, helped humans and animals survive. This challenged ideas that competition was most important for evolution. == Examples of mutual aid == === Historical examples === From the 1800s to early 1900s, mutual aid included: * trade unions * friendly societies that helped members with healthcare and funeral costs * craft guilds * working men's clubs that provided health insurance === Recent examples === More recently, mutual aid has been important in: * Black communities * working-class neighbourhoods * immigrant groups * LGBT+ communities During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, mutual aid groups: * delivered food and medicine * helped people who were isolating * provided support at neighbourhood and street level * created connections between people during lockdown == Challenges for mutual aid groups == Groups may struggle with: * finding people with technical skills * getting funding * being taken seriously by official organisations * avoiding power imbalances between members Category:Relationships",
