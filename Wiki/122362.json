 "text": "Status Quo, also known as The Quo or just Quo, is a rock band from England. They were called \"The Status Quo\" in late 1967, and settled on the name \"Status Quo\" in 1970. They have recorded over 60 chart hits in the UK, and have sold a total of 118 million records worldwide. They have also had a total of 33 hit albums in the UK charts - more than any other band other than the Rolling Stones. Their hayday was in the early to mid '70's with hits like Caroline, Whatever You Want, and Down Down. They formed in 1962, changed their name to The Status Quo in 1967 and to Status Quo in 1969. Although sometimes criticized for a repetitive and apparently simple guitar riff sequence and harmonies on many of their numbers, their musical versatility can be heard in some of their earlier or less well-known numbers, such as Ice in the Sun, Pictures of Matchstick Men and Forty-Five Hundred Times. The latter probably highlights, more than any other, Rossi and Parfitt's talent for close vocal and guitar harmonies, which owe much to the English folk and folk/rock genres. Whether intentional or not this has become their hallmark. Status Quo famously opened the Live Aid concert in 1985 with 'Rocking All Over the World' - the then largest live television broadcast ever. Rick Parfitt died in 2016 from sepsis in Spain. ==Band members== *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar (1962 - present) *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Rhythm Guitar (1967 - 2016) *Andy Bown - Keyboards/ Guitar/ Harmonica / Backing Vocals (1973 - present) *John 'Rhino' Edwards -Bass Guitar/ Guitar/ Backing Vocals (1986 - present) *Leon Cave - Drums, Percussion (2013 - present) ==Timeline== The Scorpions (1962) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Alan Key - Keyboards The Scorpions (1962) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Jess Jaworski - Keyboards *Barry Smith - Drums The Spectres (1963) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Jess Jaworski - Keyboards *John Coghlan - Drums The Spectres (1964-1967) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Roy Lynes - Keyboards *John Coghlan - Drums Traffic Jam (1967) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Roy Lynes - Keyboards *John Coghlan - Drums The Status Quo (1967-1970) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Roy Lynes - Keyboards *John Coghlan - Drums Status Quo (1971-1973) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *John Coghlan - Drums Status Quo (1973-1981) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Andy Bown - Keyboards *John Coghlan - Drums Status Quo (1982-1985) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar *Alan Lancaster - Bass Guitar / Vocals *Andy Bown - Keyboards *Pete Kircher - Drums Status Quo (1986-2000) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar *Andy Bown - Keyboards *John 'Rhino' Edwards - Bass Guitar *Jeff Rich - Drums Status Quo (2000 - 2013) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar *Andy Bown - Keyboards *John 'Rhino' Edwards - Vocals / Bass Guitar *Matt Letley - Drums *Leon Cave - Drums Status Quo (2013 - Present) *Francis Rossi - Vocals / Lead Guitar *Rick Parfitt - Vocals / Guitar (Died in 2016) *Andy Bown - Keyboards *John 'Rhino' Edwards - Vocals / Bass Guitar *Leon Cave - Drums Category:1960s British music groups Category:1970s British music groups Category:1980s British music groups Category:1990s British music groups Category:2000s British music groups Category:2010s British music groups Category:English hard rock bands Category:English rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1962 Category:Musical groups from London Category:1962 establishments in England",
