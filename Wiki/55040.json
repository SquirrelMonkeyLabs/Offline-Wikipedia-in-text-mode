 "text": "Robert Anson Heinlein (July 7, 1907 â€“ May 8, 1988) was an American writer. He mostly wrote science fiction books. He won the Hugo Award four times. Probably his best-known novels are Starship Troopers (1959, Hugo Award, was made into a film), and Stranger in a Strange Land (1961, Hugo Award). Two other Hugo awards were for Double Star (1956) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). Together with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke he is seen as one of the Big Three of Science Fiction. Heinlein employed his concept of the \"World as Myth\" in various works, notably his science fiction novel The Number of the Beast, which features a device which navigates through Block Time (aka Eternalism) in a plenum of innumerable alternate universes. == References == Category:1907 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Hugo Award winning writers Category:Writers from Missouri Category:Libertarians",
