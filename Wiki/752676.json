 "text": "New Meadow, currently known as the Montgomery Waters Meadow for sponsorship reasons, is a football stadium located in the county town of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. It is the home ground of Shrewsbury Town FC. The stadium opened in July 2007, replacing Gay Meadow as the club's home ground. The stadium can hold 9,875 spectators and is all seated. It has four stands, one on each side of the pitch. In June 2017, Shrewsbury Town applied to the Sports Grounds Safety Authority for permission to turn a section of the stadium into a safe standing area. They were given permission, making them the first club in the English Football League to have a safe standing section at their stadium. Unlike Gay Meadow, the stadium is not located within Shrewsbury town centre and is instead in Meole Brace, a suburb in the south-east of the town. It can be difficult for fans to get to. The club has a matchday travel plan that asks spectators to walk, cycle or use organised transport where they can. Shrewsbury railway station is just over two miles from the stadium. The Meole Brace Park and Ride bus service is close to the stadium. The stadium's highest ever attendance is 10,210. This was the attendance of a League Cup match against Premier League club Chelsea on 28 October 2014. The tournament's sponsor at the time, Capital One, provided two temporary stands which were placed in two corners of the stadium to make room for more fans for the match.
