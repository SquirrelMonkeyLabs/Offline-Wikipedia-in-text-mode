The Central Avenue branch is the second of Andrew Carnegie's four libraries in Minneapolis. The library opened on November 15, 1915 and quickly became one of the most active branches. The Central Avenue branch was the only Carnegie library in Minneapolis to be torn down. The building was made poorly and was falling apart. The cost for a renovation would be more to make a new building. In 1973 Northeast Library was built in the location where the Central Avenue library was the year before. == Updates to the 1973 building == The library was renovated in 2011. The renovation costed $5.2 million. The remodel added 2,400 square feet.
