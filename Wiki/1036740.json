This family today shows the same Coat of Arms as the De Graeff family.\" Accessed 29 sept 2011 During the Dutch Golden Age the wealth of the De Graeff family was based on commercial transactions and their marriage policy. In terms of their political commitment, they belonged to the Republican faction and were critica against the House of Orange.Pieter C. Vies: Triumph of Peace Together with the Republican political leaders, the Bicker family and Johan de Witt, they strived for the abolition of stadtholdership. They desired the full sovereignty of the individual regions in a form in which the Republic of the United Seven Netherlands was not ruled by a single person. Instead of a sovereign (or stadtholder) the political and military power was lodged with the States General and with the regents of the cities in Holland. The De Graeff and Bicker families, for example, tried to imitate the centralistic, autocratic style of government of the Florentine Medici.The familial state: ruling families and merchant capitalism in early modern europe, p 101, by Julia Adams The Dutch historian and archivist Bas Dudok van Heel said about the power of families like that of de Graeff and Bicker: In Florence, families like Bicker and De Graeff would have been uncrowned princes.Geert Mak, Die vielen Leben des Jan Six: Geschichte einer Amsterdamer Dynastie During the Dutch Golden Age, members of the De Graeff family were also important patrons of art like such as Rembrandt, Govaert Flinck, Gerard ter Borch, Jacob van Ruisdael, Caspar Netscher, Gerard de Lairesse, Artus Quellinus and Joost van den Vondel.Pieter C. Vies: Andries de Graeff (1611–1678) ’t Gezagh is heerelyk: doch vol bekommeringen. (PDF) The family spreades into different lines in The Netherlands, South Africa and the German-speaking countries. In 1885, diplomat Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek, of the Dutch main line was introduced in the new Dutch nobility with the predicate Jonkheer. In 2013 the worldwide Family Association Gräff-Graeff (Familienverband Gräff-Graeff e.V.) was founded for the Graeff lineage of Wolfgang von Graben. The chairmanship and administration of the Family Association must not be confused with the function of a head of the whole family and their different branches.
