 "text": "The Lehigh Valley IronPigs are a Minor League Baseball team from Allentown, Pennsylvania. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The IronPigs are partnered with the Philadelphia Phillies, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Phillies. The team is named \"IronPigs\" because the Lehigh Valley, the region where the team plays, is famous for making steel, which is made with pig iron. The IronPigs play at a stadium called Coca-Cola Park, which opened in 2008. It has seats for over 8,000 people, with enough room for over 10,000 people. It cost more than US$50 million to build. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball- Reference Category:2000s establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Allentown, Pennsylvania Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Philadelphia Phillies Category:Sports in Pennsylvania",
