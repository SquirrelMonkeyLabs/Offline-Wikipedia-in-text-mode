This is partly due to their partnership with composer Shinsadong Tiger, who has favored that genre. '아이돌 작곡가' 신사동호랭이, 트렌드를 버렸다?(인터뷰①). Joy News 24. May 6, 2011. T-ara uses a wide variety of visual looks in their dance and performances. T-ara debuted in July 2009 with the single \"Lies\". 전영록 딸 전보람, 티아라 새 멤버 합류! ‘가수 3대 집안’ (T-ara gets a new member) Newsen. June 3, 2009. Their first studio album was called the Absolute First Album. It was released in December 2009 and lead to several hit songs. These included \"TTL (Time to Love)\", \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\", and \"You Drive Me Crazy\". In 2011, T-ara released the song \"Roly-Poly\". It became the best-selling single of the year on the Gaon chart in South Korea. The group also became popular in Japan. Later that year they signed a contract with agency J-Rock to manage their sales in Japan. The contract was for USD 4.7 million. This was the most any Korean girl group had made in a foreign market at the time. 티아라, 50억 근접 역대 최고가 전속계약..일본 J-ROCK과 47억 Newsen. September 7, 2011. T-ara went on to make a Japanese studio album called Jewelry Box. This album reached number one on the Oricon weekly charts in Japan. Also in 2011, T-ara released the Korean album Black Eyes. It lead to three number ones songs in a row. These were \"Cry Cry\", \"We Were in Love\" and \"Lovey-Dovey\". In 2012, T-ara had a drop in popularity. The group was accused of disagreements and problems with one another. Soon after, Hwayoung left T-ara. Areum did the same a year after. After these issues, T-ara's albums and songs had mixed success in South Korea. As a result, T-ara changed their focus to China. In 2014, they made a cover of the Chopstick Brothers' song \"Little Apple\". After focusing on China, T-ara became one of the most popular K-pop groups in the country. In 2017, the contracts of Soyeon and Boram were set to expire. On the other hand, Qri, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon had extended their contracts. This would reduce the members of the group from six to four. T-ara had intended to make one more album as a six-member group. However, a conflict with their management lead to a delay and it did not happen. T-ara's next release was as a four-member group. This was the EP called What's My Name? which was released in June 2017. ==History== ===2009–2010: Formation and debut=== T-ara was formed by the record label Mnet Media, which is now known as Stone Music Entertainment. The original members of T-ara were Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon. They trained together for three years before their debut. The group's name is based on the word \"tiara\". The idea for the name was that they would be \"queens of the music industry\". 걸그룹 이름 뜻, 네티즌 “온 몸이 오글거리는 속 뜻” . Star FN News. April 15, 2012. Retrieved September 1, 2012. Their first song came before their official debut as a group. It was \"Joheun Saram\" for the soundtrack of the Cinderella Man television show. One month before their official debut, Mnet Media changed some of the members of the group. Jiae and Jiwon left T-ara in early June 2009, and were replaced by Boram, Soyeon, and Qri. Then in early July 2009, T-ara was moved from Mnet Media to Core Contents Media. Core Contents Media is a subsidiary of Mnet Media, and is now known as MBK Entertainment. T-ara made their debut in July 2009 on the Radio Star talk show.

Their first performance was on the M Countdown music show a few days later. It included the songs \"Geojitmal\" (or \"Lies\") and \"Norabollae?\". The performance had negative reviews by those who watched it. Some felt was that it was lip-synced and had an \"elementary school\" appearance. '립싱크야? 더빙이야?' 티아라 데뷔무대 '혹평' (Is it Lipsynched?

T-ara made their first studio album in November 2009, with the name Absolute First Album. Core Contents Media held a survey to have the public help choose which song would be the title track. The choices were \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" and \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" (처음처럼, \"Like the First Time\"). Of the 9,000 people who took the survey, 53% chose \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\". However, \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" was chosen as the title track. It made it to number four on the Gaon chart. \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" made it to number ten. T-ara performed these songs live on the Music Bank television show on 4 December 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards, T-ara won Rookie of the Year along with girl group 4minute. The group won their first music show award with \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" on the first day of 2010. The song went on to win five awards in total.

The digital release was on February 23. The two lead singles were \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" (너 때문에 미쳐; \"I Go Crazy Because of You\") and \"Naega Neomu Apa\" (내가 너무 아파, \"I'm Really Hurt\").

It made it to number two on the weekly Gaon chart and number thirty-five on the yearly chart. T-ara performed \"Naega Neomu Apa\" on music shows in March and early April 2010. In July 2010, T-ara added Hwayoung as a seventh member. The stated reason was to give other members some relief from their heavy schedules. It would also allow each member to be away for solo activities from time to time. In November 2010, the group starred in the third season of the reality show Hello Baby. Later that month, T-ara released \"Wae Ireoni\". It is the lead single for their first extended play, which is called Temptastic.

It was given the name \"Roly-Poly in Copacabana\" after the song \"Copacabana\" which was popular in the 1980's in disco clubs. The album made it to number three on the Gaon chart. The song made it to number forty-five on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. The group then performed the song on the Music Bank television show. T-ara made a Japanese version of \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" in September 2011. It made it to number one on the Oricon weekly chart. This made T-ara the first non-Japanese girl group to make it to number one on the Oricon chart. The song also made it to number one on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. In November 2011, T-ara made their third EP, Black Eyes, which made it to number two on the Gaon charts. The album followed the release of the song \"Cry Cry\", which made it to number one on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. \"Cry Cry\" also won two first-place awards on M Countdown. The music video for \"Cry Cry\" had a billion Korean won budget and a thirty-minute drama story line. The group made their second Japanese song, a remake of \"Yayaya\" from their Temptastic EP, in November. It made it to number seven on the Oricon charts and number six on the Billboard Japan Hot 100. In December 2011, the group held a three-day concert tour in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. By the end of the year, T-ara had become the second most popular girl group in Korea. Also in December, T-ara made a ballad with Davichi called \"Uri Saranghaetjanha\" (우리 사랑했잖아, \"We Were in Love\"). It was later included on T-ara's Funky Town re-release album. \"Uri Saranghaetjanha\" made it to number one on the Gaon chart and number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. Both groups performed the song on SBS's Inkigayo television show. T-ara re-released Black Eyes under the title Funky Town in January 2012.

It made it to number one on both the Gaon and Billboard Korea charts. In February 2012, Forbes Korea listed T-ara as number 17 in their list of \"Top 40 Power Celebrities\". In April, Core Contents Media announced that they would add two new members to T-ara. Areum joined T-ara in June 2012, bringing the group to eight members. The second new member was to be Dani, who was 14 years old at the time. While she starred in T-ara's \"Day by Day\" music video, she did not end up becoming a member.

This was the first time Areum performed with the group. ===\"Bullying\" rumors and return to activity=== In late July 2012, T-ara held a concert in Japan. Hwayoung only performed one song due to a leg injury. Afterwards, one member of T-ara tweeted a message about showing determination. Later four of the other members agreed with her. After this Hwayoung and her twin sister (Hyoyoung) tweeted about a \"bad person\". This lead to rumors of conflict within the group. Some assumed that Hwayoung was being bullied. Soon after, Core Contents Media ended Hwayoung's contract and she left T-ara. The stated reason was that Hwayoung's actions were harming teamwork. The record label claimed that the bullying rumors were not a factor in the decision. The group stated that the rumors were not true but did confirm a conflict between Hwayoung and the others. Due to the rumors, the group put all activity on hold for a time. Their scheduled performances were postponed without a new date planned. In September, T-ara resumed their activity as a group. In that month they released Mirage, which was a re-issue of their Day by Day EP with additional songs. Two of the songs from the EP were also released as singles on the same day. These were \"Sexy Love\" and \"Najgwa Bam (Love All)\" (낮과 밤, \"Day and Night\"). \"Sexy Love\" made it to number four on the Gaon charts and number three on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100 charts. While the new EP and song were a success, the group’s popularity suffered a drop due to the bullying rumors. Later in September, T-ara made a Japanese version of \"Day by Day\". In October, T-ara released a greatest hits album in Japan. They stated that it was in celebration of one year since their Japanese debut.

Hwayoung used the opportunity to state how hard it was for her, and her only support was her sister. This brought the rumors back to public attention. Soon after, a former staff member claimed that it had really been the twins who had \"bullied\" the other members. This person released texts that appeared to show Hyoyoung threatening Areum with physical harm. Other staff members also came forward with evidence that Hwayoung had treated the other members and staff badly. They also claimed that she had faked how severe her injury was, in order to get more sympathy. Hwayoung at first tried to deny this, but later admitted that the texts were real. This put an end to the bullying rumors about other members of T-ara. In March 2017, MBK Entertainment announced Soyeon and Boram were ending their contracts in a few months time. They also stated that T-ara would make one more album as a six member group. However, a conflict with their management lead to a delay and it did not happen.
