Music City Mystique is a member of the Southeastern Color Guard Circuit and Winter Guard International. Mystique plays in Percussion Independent World Class (PIW). This is for groups that play music or visual shows that are the most difficult in both SCGC and WGI. Music City Mystique has been a PIW Finalist every year since 1995 and were WGI World Champions in 1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2011, and 2017. Right now, Mystique is the only 8-time Winter Guard International Percussion World Champion.2006 WGI World Championships Even though they are both from Nashville, Music City Mystique is not related to the Music City Drum and Bugle Corps. == History == Music City Mystique was made in 1995 by Don Click and Chris Finen in Nashville, Tennessee. This group was made by putting the drumlines from two local high schools together. This was because those high schools did not have the funding or members to play own their own. Since then, Mystique has grown a lot and is not given money or funded by any local high school. Most members are college age, but some high schoolers play as well. Mystique currently plays in the Percussion Independent World Class in both SCGC and WGI. They have not been defeated for their entire time in SCGC, and have never gotten lower than 6th place in WGI. This group sometimes plays at Tennessee Titans games. == Past shows == Year Program Title Placement Score Class 1995 A New Beginning 4th 82.65 PIM 1996 Color of Rhythm 1st 95.10 PIM 1997 A Different Drum 1st 96.25 PIW 1998 Vodun 1st 95.30 PIW 1999 From Dawn Till Dusk: The Serengeti 2nd 95.15 PIW 2000 The Four Elements 4th 91.85 PIW 2001 Strength & Honor 1st 96.50 PIW 2002 The Persistence of Time 3rd 94.20 PIW 2003 Reflections 4th 93.45 PIW 2004 Se7en 1st 95.85 PIW 2005 Cosmic Proportions 3rd 95.25 PIW 2006 McM Traveling Sideshow 1st 96.20 PIW 2007 E=McM 2nd 96.30 PIW 2008 The Adventures of... 4th 94.60 PIW 2009 Requiem 3rd 96.225 PIW 2010 Fantastique 3rd 95.513 PIW 2011 Mantra 1st 97.050 PIW 2012 NÃ¼-Tribe 2nd 95.500 PIW 2013 Taboo 3rd 96.125 PIW 2014 Windows to the Soul 2nd 96.588 PIW 2015 The Game 4th 96.063 PIW 2016 In Bloom 5th 94.863 PIW 2017 The Hand of Man 1st 98.000 PIW 2018 Disciples 5th 94.825 PIW 2019 Medium 3rd 97.5125 PIW 2020 Sol 1st* 87.700* PIW 2021 Nocturne - - PIW 2022 Come _Hell!_ or High _Water!_ 5th 95.563 PIW 2023 Plastique 6th 94.813 PIW 2024 The Red Line 5th 95.213 PIW * Score taken from the final WGI show before the rest of the season was cancelled because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. * Music City Mystique did not compete in WGI's 2021 Virtual Season. * PIM means Percussion Independent Marching and PIW means Percussion Independent World == References == == Other websites == * Official website Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Drummers",
