Classes began in 1855 with three professors and 16 students. The buildings were officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor of the Colony of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, on 3 October 1855. The first chancellor, Redmond Barry (later Sir Redmond), held the position until his death in 1880. At first all the buildings were built in the gothic revival style. In the 1950s a modernist style was started as the new \"house style\", resulting in the mix of university buildings seen today. The opening of the university was made possible by the wealth coming from the Victorian gold rush. The university was to be a \"civilising influence\" at a time of rapid settlement and commercial growth (Selleck, 2003). It was not a religious university and was not allowed to offer in degrees in divinity. The churches could only build colleges on only the northern edge. The local population wanted 'useful' subjects like law, not 'useless' subjects like classics. The people of Melbourne won this argument, and law was introduced in 1857, and medicine and engineering in the 1860s. Women were let into courses in 1881. In 1902 the university was bankrupt when it was found out that the man in charge of the university's money, Frederick Dickson, had stolen ₤24,000. The university's annual budget was £15,000. Dickson was jailed for seven years. This resulted in a royal commission that came up with new ways of funding, and new courses including agriculture and education. After World War II, there were more students wanting to go to a university and Melbourne University became much larger and more inclusive. The 150th anniversary was celebrated in 2003. 150th anniversary University of Melbourne website ==Related books== * Selleck, R.J.W. (2003). The Shop: The University of Melbourne, 1850–1939.
