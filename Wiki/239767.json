 "text": "About Time is the third studio album by Pennywise, released on June 13, 1995. While the album was not a commercial success, it is considered by some critics to be one of Pennywise's best releases, and it includes their concert staples, \"Peaceful Day\", \"Perfect People\", \"Every Single Day\", and \"Same Old Story\". About Time was also the first Pennywise album to chart in Billboard. Most of the album follows the theme of problems with time: fear of it passing, controlling it and accepting it. About Time was also the last Pennywise album to feature bass player Jason Thirsk, who committed suicide on July 29, 1996. After debating whether to break up, or to continue on with a new bass player, Pennywise decided to hire a new bassist, Randy Bradbury, who would stay with the band permanently. ==Track listing== # \"Peaceful Day\" – 2:52 # \"Waste of Time\" – 2:18 # \"Perfect People\" – 3:04 # \"Every Single Day\" – 2:39 # \"Searching\" – 2:55 # \"Not Far Away\" – 2:52 # \"Freebase\" – 2:41 # \"It's What You Do with It\" – 2:25 # \"Try\" – 2:32 # \"Same Old Story\" – 2:42 # \"I Won't Have It\" – 2:30 # \"Killing Time\" – 2:37 ==Personnel== *Jim Lindberg – lead vocals *Fletcher Dragge – guitar *Jason Thirsk – bass *Byron Macmackin – drums *Eddie Ashworth – assistant engineer *Jerry Finn – producer, engineer *Brett Gurewitz – producer *Fred Hidalgo – creative director Category:1995 albums Category:Pennywise albums",
