 "text": "Weaver ants (also known as tailor ants or green ants; genus Oecophylla) are eusocial insects of the Formicidae family. They make their nests from living leaves, still attached to the tree. Instead of needles and thread, they use a rare type of silk, made in the mouths of their own grubs.HÃ¶lldober, B. & Wilson, E.O. 1990. The ants. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. The grubs are passed to and from between the leaves, to sew them together. Tailor ants may be found in the rainforest of Asia. Colonies of weaver ants can be very large, containing more than half a million workers. The colonies can be made up of more than a hundred nests across several trees. == References == ==Other websites== * Weaver Ants - National Geographic, May 2011 * AntWeb - Ants of the world * Tree Of Life - Oecophylla Category:Ants",
