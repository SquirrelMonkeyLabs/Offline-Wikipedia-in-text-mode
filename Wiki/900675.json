 "text": "The pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor) is a critically endangered monkey species found in a small area of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. It was named the mascot of Manaus, Brazil in 2005. It is a New World monkey. It is found at the city limits of Manaus, the capital of the Amazonas state of Brazil and up to 35 km to the north and 100 km to the east. The main distribution is between two rivers: Rio Cuieiras and Rio Preto da Eva. Pied tamarins are also found between Rio Preto da Eva and Rio Urubu, but are more rare there. There appears to be interspecific competition between the pied tamarin and the red-handed tamarin. The red-handed tamarin is expanding its range by taking over parts of the pied tamarin's range. There are therefore multiple threats to the long- term survival of the pied tamarin that stem from habitat destruction and from interspecific competition. The pied tamarin is found in old-growth forests, sand forest and smaller secondary forest fragments. Their density is higher in secondary forest fragments than in primary forest. ==References== Category:Critically endangered species Category:New World monkeys Category:Mammals of South America",
