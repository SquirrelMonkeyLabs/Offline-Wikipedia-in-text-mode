 "text": "Employment and Support Allowance is a United Kingdom social security benefit for adults younger than the State Pension age who are having difficulty finding work because of sickness. It was started in 2008. It is paid when Statutory Sick Pay comes to an end. People who have paid enough National Insurance can get contributory ESA. Income-related ESA is for people who have not paid enough National Insurance contributions. People who have more than Â£16,000 savings cannot get that. After 13 weeks most people have to have a Work Capability Assessment. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom",
