 "text": "Emily Jordan Osment (born March 10, 1992 Los Angeles, California) is an American actress and singer. She is most famous for her roles of Gerti Giggles in the Spy Kids trilogy, and Lilly Truscott in Hannah Montana. The younger sister of former child actor Haley Joel Osment, actress/vocalist Emily Osment launched her career at a young age, having landed a role in the 1999 film The Secret Life of Girls when she was only seven years old. The Los Angeles native furthered her career by also appearing in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams, Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over, and the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana, where she enjoyed a recurring role as Lily Truscott. Osment also tried her hand at singing, kicking off that aspect of her career by performing alongside Billy Ray Cyrus on his 2007 album Home at Lastand contributing a song to the soundtrack of R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It, in which she also starred. After making appearances on several Disney compilations, she began voicing a desire to tackle more rock-influenced music, and writing sessions with members of Eve 6 and Plain White T's helped her compile enough material for her debut EP, 2009's All the Right Wrongs. Osment switched directions for her full-length debut, though, leaving rock music behind and embracing electronic dance-pop on 2010s Fight or Flight. == Other websites == * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Los Angeles Category:American child actors Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:Disney actors Category:American electropop singers",
