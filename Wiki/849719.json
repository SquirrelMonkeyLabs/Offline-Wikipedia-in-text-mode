 "text": "Ningthou Kangba (; 1405 BC-1359 BC) was a king of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak) kingdom. He invented Sagol Kangjei, the earliest form of the modern day polo sports. He was the son of King Tangja Leela Pakhangba (1445 BC-1405 BC) and Queen Sinbee Leima. He was the consort of Queen Leima Taritnu, daughter of a king named Nongpok Ningthou of the Nongmaiching Hill in the east of Imphal. According to the Ningthou Kangbalon, an ancient historical account of his family, King Kangba was born in a cave in the Mount Koubru in northern Manipur. Some historians thought that he belonged to the house of the Salang Leishangthem dynasty. However, some thought that he belonged to the house of the Khaba Nganba dynasty. In 2018, the Government of Manipur proclaimed that a heritage site will be developed in memory of the king in the Kangmong village, to promote tourism. ==References== ==Other websites== * A Brief history of the Meiteis of Manipur * SAGOL-KANGJEI * * Ningthou Kangba remembered : 07th apr18 ~ E-Pao!
