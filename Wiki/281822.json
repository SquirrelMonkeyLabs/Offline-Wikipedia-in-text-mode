The NAS, NAE, and IOM are honorary membership organizations, with a total membership of over 6,000 scientists, engineers, and health professionals. New members for each organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. The NRC is called the \"working arm\" of the Academies, which serves to collect, analyze, and share information through studies and reports. The National Academies produce independent recommendations and policy reports by enlisting top scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts (not limited to those in Academies membership) to address important scientific and technical problems. The National Academies do not perform original research; rather they provide independent advice.The National Academies: Advisers to the Nation on Science, Engineering, and Medicine Federal agencies are the primary financial sponsors of the Academies' work; additional studies are funded by state agencies, foundations, other private sponsors, and the National Academies endowment. The external sponsors have no control over the conduct or results of a study, once the statement of task and budget are finalized. ==Other websites== *The Institute of Medicine *The National Academy of Engineering ==Notes== Category:1863 establishments in the United States Category:National academies of sciences",
