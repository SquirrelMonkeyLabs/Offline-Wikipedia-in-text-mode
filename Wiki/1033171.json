The winner of the contest gets the chance to represent Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest. == Format == Each contest lasts for one show. Once all of the entrants have performed, they are ranked by both a jury and a public vote which give a set of points based on the rankings (for example, if there are six contestants, then the highest ranked contestant gets 6 points, with the lowest getting 1).
