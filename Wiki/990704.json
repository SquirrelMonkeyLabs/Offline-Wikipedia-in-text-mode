 "text": "Winning the Speakership in the House of Representatives in the United States Congress can happen if an individual can gain a majority (218 votes) of the votes from other representatives. This can be simple, but in 1923, it took 9 votes to elect . It was 100 years later that in 2023, it took 15 votes to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker. It took multiple votes because the Republicans were split on who they wanted to be speaker. A majority of Republicans were okay with Rep. McCarthy, but some wanted other people, such as Jim Jordan, , Jim Banks, Hakeem Jeffries, and even Ex-President Donald Trump. But after 15 votes, Far-Right Republicans voted for Rep. McCarthy after he promised them a lot more power in Congress. Category:2023 in the United States Category:2020s elections in the United States Category:January 2023 events",
