 "text": "Early Modern English (EModEFor example, or EMnE) or Early New English (ENE) is the stage of the English language in the 16th and the 17th centuries, from the Tudor period to the Restoration when written and spoken English begins to be familiar to English-speakers today, who use Modern English. The King James Bible was translated to and William Shakespeare wrote his plays in Early Modern English.

Before and after the accession of James I to the English throne in 1603, the English standard began to influence the spoken and written Middle Scots of Scotland. == References == Category:English language",
