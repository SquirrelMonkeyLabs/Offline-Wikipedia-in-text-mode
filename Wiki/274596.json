She not only explored the scenery but also the tradition and life of the people there. She confesses that her life has entirely changed through the people she met. After she finished her travels, aiding people in danger of war and calamity is her only interest nowadays. ==Enthusiasm== From the interview with the Korea Herald, Han thinks that the happiest person is the one who works for what he/she really is enthusiastic about. For her, 'courage' is not to fear when attempting to do something, and the amount of courage depends on how much the person is eager to do such thing. The life schedule of Han does not follow others. Regardless of the age, she is designing her life according to her dream and faith toward international aiding. ==Influence== She is one of the most respected figures in Korea, being a role model for Korean students.
