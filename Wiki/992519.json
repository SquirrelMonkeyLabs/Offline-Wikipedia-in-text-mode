 "text": "Siphonognathus is a genus of ray-finned fish, weed whitings in the family Odacidae which are endemic to Southern Australian coastal waters. They are sometimes called tube-finned fish, thanks to their tubular appearance. These fish are characterized by their extremely elongate bodies and live primarily in seagrass beds. == Species == There are currently six recognized species in this genus: * Siphonognathus argyrophanes J. Richardson, 1858 (Tubemouth) * Siphonognathus attenuatus J. D. Ogilby, 1897 (Slender weed whiting) * Siphonognathus beddomei R. M. Johnston, 1885 (Pencil weed whiting) * Siphonognathus caninis J. K. Scott, 1976 (Sharpnose weed whiting) * Siphonognathus radiatus (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834) (Long-rayed weed whiting) * Siphonognathus tanyourus M. F. Gomon & Paxton, 1986 (Longtail weed whiting) They were formerly placed in separate genera. They placed S. attentuatus, S. beddomei, S. radiatus and S. tanyourus in the separate genus Sheardichthys and S. caninis on the monospecific genus Parodax, leaving Siphonognathus as a monospecific genus containing only the tubemouth (S. argyrophanes). == References == # Froese, Rainer and Pauly, Daniel, eds.
