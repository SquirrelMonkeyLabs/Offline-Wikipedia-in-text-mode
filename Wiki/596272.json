 "text": "Hurricane Irma was a Category 5 hurricane in 2017, the 9th named storm, 4th hurricane, 2nd major hurricane, and a 1st Category 5 hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. Irma is also the 4th consecutive hurricane of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane seasonâ€”after Franklin, Gert, and Harvey. The storm threatened the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Irma was also forecasted to threaten the East Coast of the United States, but later forecast to hit Southwest Florida. Irma was the first major hurricane to develop in the eastern Atlantic since Hurricane Julia in 2010. The storm developed on August 30, 2017 near the Cape Verde islands. On September 5, 2017, the storm became a Category 5 hurricane. It had maximum sustained winds of 180 miles per hour since Hurricane Wilma in twelve years earlier. As it hit and scraped along Cuba, Irma went down to a Category 2 hurricane. Irma was the easternmost Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane or tropical storm watches and warnings were issued from Haiti to Dominica. Hurricane Irma inflicted $77 billion worth of damage especially in Florida after making landfall in Florida. Due to significant amount of damage and loss of life from the storm especially in Florida, the name Irma was retired in April 2018 by the World Meteorological Organization, and it was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season. ==References== Category:2017 disasters Category:2017 in North America Irma Irma Category:Saint Martin Category:September 2017 events Irma Irma",
