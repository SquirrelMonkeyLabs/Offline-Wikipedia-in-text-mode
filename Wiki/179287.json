 "text": "Intimacy is the third studio album by British indie rock band Bloc Party. It was recorded in two weeks in different places around London and Kent in the UK. Bloc Party liked the idea of releasing their album by download over the Internet, so on 21 August 2008, people could buy it online. A Compact Disc version was released a few days later on 24 August 2008. It got to number 8 on the UK Albums Chart and to number 18 on the Billboard 200 Chart in the USA. Category:Bloc Party albums",
