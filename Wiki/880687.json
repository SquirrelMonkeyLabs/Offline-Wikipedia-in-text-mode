 "text": "Sylvia's tree frog (Cruziohyla sylviae) is a frog that lives in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Scientists have seen it no more than 750 meters above sea level. People have seen it between 30 and 1600 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 44.3 to 67.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 73.5 to 88.2 mm long. This frog has a mix of dark green and light green on its back, with pale blue spots. It has yellow-orange sides with thick black stripes. It has a small yellow spot behind each eye. The spot is covered up when the frog is still. Unlike Cruziohyla calcarifer, it does not have dark brown marks on its underside. ==Home== This frog lives in trees where the branches come together like a roof in forests and flood plains. The frog climbs down to lower branches when it is time to lay eggs. The female frog lays eggs in water in dead trees. People have also seen tadpoles in water storage lakes if there are enough trees nearby. ==Threats== This frog is not endangered, and people have seen more of them than there were before. However, they are still in some danger because human beings change the forests where they live into farms and other things and cut down trees for the wood. This is called habitat loss. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
