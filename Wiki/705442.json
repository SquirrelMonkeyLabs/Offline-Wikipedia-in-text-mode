 "text": "\"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us\" is a Facebook event that was planned for September 20, 2019 at Area 51, a United States Air Force (USAF) base. The purpose of the event was to raid the site in search for aliens while they \"Naruto run\". The event was created by Matty Roberts as a satire event. Roberts posted the event on June 27, 2019. About 3,000,000 people responded \"going\" or \"interested\" on the event's page. Air Force officials and Nevada state officials warned the group members not to raid the area or otherwise they would use executive force. Copycat events such as plans to storm a secret vault of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Loch Ness, and the Bermuda Triangle have also been created. ==References== Category:June 2019 events Category:Internet memes",
