 "text": "A hymn is a religious song of worship in Christianity, or a sacred song. Collections of hymns are known as hymnals. ==Overview== Hymns are often sung by the entire group at a church. They are sometimes sung only by a special group called a choir. A piano or organ often plays the music while people sing. Most hymns are written in a four-part harmony, often employing a common meter. Thus, they tend to have a traditional sound. ==History== Many early hymns were taken from the Psalms. Later hymns included ideas from other parts of the Bible. Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley wrote many hymns. In more modern times, Fanny Crosby wrote many more. Some hymns are prayers to God. Others preach about God. Songs describing God or how people relate to Him are also called gospels rather than hymns. ==Examples== One of the most popular hymns is Amazing Grace, which was written by John Newton (1725 â€“ 1807) who became a Christian as he aged. The hymn tells how God saved him from sin though he saw himself as unworthy of it.\"Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound\", Dictionary of American Hymnology. Retrieved 31 October 2009. This is an example of God's grace. ==Related pages== * Middle Ages * Church music * Ancient history * Gregorian chant * History of Christianity ==References== Category:Middle Ages Category:Christianity Category:Musical forms Category:Ancient history Category:Christian hymns Category:Christian music Category:History of Christianity",
