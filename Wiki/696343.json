 "text": "Judith Kerr, OBE (surname pronounced ; 14 June 1923 â€“ 22 May 2019) was a German-born British writer and illustrator. She was known for her Mog series and The Tiger Who Came to Tea. She also wrote novels for young adults such as When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, which gave a child's-eye view of the Second World War. Kerr was born in Berlin, but moved to the United Kingdom before the Nazis rose to power because Kerr's father, openly a Nazi critic, was scared for his family's safety. Kerr later became a naturalized British subject. Kerr died on 22 May 2019 from a short-illness at her home in Barnes, London at the age of 95. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2019 deaths Category:English novelists Category:British illustrators Category:English children's writers Category:Writers from London",
