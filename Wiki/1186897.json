 "text": "Belisarius was the Byzantine general of Justinian I who helped retake parts of the lost Roman Empire. == Early Life and Early Career == Many people say Belisarius was born in Bulgaria around 500. He eventually became one of the prince's guards. The prince at the time was Justinian. == War against Persia and Nika riots == Belisarius participated in the Iberian Wars against the Sassanian Persians. After Justin I died in 527, Justinian became emperor and promoted Belisarius. Belisarius fought the Persians at The Battle of Dara, where he defeated them. Belisarius was then sent to fight the Persians led by Khosrow I. Belisarius eventually defeated the Persians at the Battle of Nisbis and then the Siege of Sisauranon in 541. Bleschames the Persian (who was in charged) also switched sides to Rome. Eventually However, he was defeated at the Battle of Callinicum, and was recalled to Constantinople. === Nika Riots === Many people expected he'd just stay in retirement until the Nika riots began. The Nika riots were led by the green and blue chariot factions, who declared Flavius Hypatius as their emperor. Justinian (with some persuasion from his wife) sent Belisarius and Narses, the eunuch of Justinian to put out the revolts. They quickly entered the Hippodrome, the place where the chariot races were held. The revolt ended with around 30,000 Byzantines dead. == Vandal War == === Prelude === The Vandal kingdom begun when they stole land from the Roman Empire as it was crumbling. They made Carthage their capital and converted to Christianity. The Vandalic War began when Gelimer kicked Hilderic of the Vandal throne, a friend of Justinian. The people slowly began to hate Gelimer since he was greedy, and began revolts. Justinian sent Belisarius to lead a campaign against the Vandals. === The Campaign === Once they were in Africa, they collected food and were near Ad Decimum, a town near Carthage. Hilderic planned to have his brother and himself ambush the Byzantines. However, his brother Ammatus was defeated and killed. Hilderic ran away from Carthage which Belisarius took and then Tzazo, the cousin of Gelimer arrived and fought at the Battle of Tricamarum, and was also defeated and died. Gelimer gave up after he fled to the Berber people and ran out of food. He was triumphed in Constantinople and Belisarius had won. == Gothic War == === Prelude === When Ostrogothic Queen Amalasuntha was murdered by King Theodahad, Belisarius was sent to fight the Goths. === Landing at Sicily === Belisarius quickly landed in Sicily and took it all with little resistance until he reached modern day Palermo. He would quickly take it anyway. === Italian main land === Once on the Italian Peninsula, he took Rhegium and then began the Siege of Naples. Belisarius sieged the city for three weeks until his army entered. Although Belisarius had a rule of not raiding cities, the army seemed to ignore this and stole anyway. Belisarius arrived at Rome and took it quickly with little resistance. The Goths were angry at Theodahad who hadn't taken any action, so they killed him and replaced him with Witiges (sometimes called Vitiges) who strengthened town garrisons so they wouldn't fall too quickly. Belisarius however took Arminium almost effortlessly. In 538, he sent an army of 1,000 men to take Milan, who succeeded. Witiges then asked for help from the neighbouring Franks, since the two had destroyed the Western Roman Empire together. 10,000 Burgundians crossed the Alps and laid siege to the Romans who had just taken the city. Belisarius sent a relief force who instead asked for help from a guy in Aemillia. Belisarius tried to get them to move, but the commanders decided they wouldn't move unless they were told by Narses. After this disaster, Narses was recalled to Constantinople. Belisarius had a plan to take Ravenna, but had to take Auximum and Fiesole so they couldn't send garrisons to flank him. Another Frankish army crossed into Italy and attacked the Goths. The Goths were routed and finally Belisarius took Auximum, Fiesole, and Ravenna. The rest of the Goths surrendered and Witiges was captured and also paraded in Constantinople. === The Goths return === Before Belisarius left, he gave Italy to many generals whom he could trust. Ildibad, who was elected king of the Goths defeated the Roman general Vitalius at Treviso, and had Uraias (one of his generals) killed because their wives argued. The Goths killed him too and replaced him with Eraric. Eraric wanted to make peace with Justinian while secretly planning to surrender the rest of Italy to him, but the Goths found out, killed him, and replaced him with Totilla . Near this time, the Plague of Justinian took place and absolutely devastated the Byzantine army, along with the Lazic War beginning forced Justinian to remove troops from Italy. Tortilla took multiple citites in the North, including Naples and Florence. He asked Justinian for a peace deal, which Justinian rejected. Belisarius came back when Rome was sieged and tried to save it, however this failed and Totilla massacred everybody except the women. Narses eventually came back and defeated Totilla at the Battle of Taginae, and killed Totilla in the fighting. The rest of the Goths were destroyed and Italy fell to Justinian. === Aftermath === This war drained Byzantine resources and manpower, and was one of the most costly campaigns of Justinian. This campaign may have been the reason the Byzantine economy was depleted during and after his reign. == Final Battle == Justinian eventually recalled Belisarius from command until the Bulgarians tried to cross the Danube. Belisarius was then sent to block their path and successfully defeated them == Later Life and Death == Belisarius was tried by Justinian because Theodora had lied about him being in conspiracy against Justinian. He was put under house arrest before quickly pardoned and retired. Belisarius would eventually die, most likely from disease. The historical misconception that he was blinded was invented by many French authors, poets, and historians who wanted to pain the aristocracy as evil and ruthless as the ideas of the French revolution were brewing. He was buried in Constantinople.",
