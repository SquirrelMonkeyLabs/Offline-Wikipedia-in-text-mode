 "text": "The Engadin or Engadine (, , , ; lit.: Valley of the Inn people) is a long high Alpine valley in the eastern Swiss Alps. It is found in the canton of Graub端nden. It is about 25,000 inhabitants. It follows the route of the Inn () from its headwaters at Maloja Pass in the southwest running roughly northeast until the Inn flows into Austria, one hundred kilometers downstream. The Inn subsequently flows at Passau into the Danube, as the only Swiss river to drain into the Black Sea. The Engadine is connected by the Julier, Albula, Fl端ela Passes and the Vereina Tunnel to the northern part of Switzerland and the rest of the canton of Graub端nden. The highest mountains of the wider area of the Engadine is the Bernina Range in the southwestern part. == References == == Other websites == * * Culture archive of the Engadin * www.engadin.stmoritz.ch * Engadin pictures - Photos of the Engadin * Webcams of the Engadin * Vegetation map Upper Engadine, 1:50'000, GIS, june 2010 Category:Valleys of Switzerland Category:Graub端nden",
