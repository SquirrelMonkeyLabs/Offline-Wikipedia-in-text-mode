 "text": "An arrowsmith is a person to takes on an occupation/role/job that forges the heads of arrows. This is usually brought up in medieval history, as more modern jobs came along, and just a small amount of the population (most of those people working for rural purposes), has the occupation today. The idea of archery was created in 20,000 BC. Like today, people did not use the bow and arrow on a regular basis. But unlike today, they mostly used this new creation for hunting. The first people ever to use it normally was the ancient Egyptians from 4,000 to 2,000 BC. Then the bows started to take a fall in popularity across the world, as gunpowder was invented, along with the cannon. It spread across eurasia, after being invented in China in the third century.
