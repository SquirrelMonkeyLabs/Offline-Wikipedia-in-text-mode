 "text": "Streptospondylus is a genus of megalosaurids. It lived in the Jurassic period in what is now France. It lived around 164.7/155.7 million years ago. This carnivore grew to lengths of 18.7 ft (5.7 meters) long, with a weight of about 1,102 IB (500 KG). The first bones of this animal were found in 1778, but its significance was not realised until well into the 19th century. Then it was sent to Georges Cuvier, who slightly mis-identified it as crocodilian. The remains were from two different creatures. Eventually, the theropod remains were named Streptospondylus altdorfensis. Category:Theropods Category:Megalosauridae Category:Jurassic dinosaurs Category:Dinosaurs of Europe",
