 "text": "Naval warfare is combat in and on the seas, oceans, or any other major bodies of water. It is usually a part of a nation's overall war effort. Men have fought battles on the sea for over 3,000 years. Traditionally naval warfare has been fleet against another fleet.Michael Lindberg; Daniel Todd, Brown-, Green-, and Blue-water Fleets: The Influence of Geography on Naval Warfare, 1861 to the Present (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002), pp. 71â€“72 Modern naval warfare has changed to include Amphibious landings, transportation of men and equipment over water and naval support of land operations.
