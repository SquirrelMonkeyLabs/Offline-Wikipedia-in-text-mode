 "text": "A rechargeable battery, also called a storage battery or a secondary cell, is a battery that can be recharged over and over again with electricity. A battery that is not rechargeable is called a primary cell or disposable battery.David Linden, Thomas B. Reddy (ed). 2002 Handbook of Batteries, 3rd edition. McGraw-Hill, New York. ISBN 0-07-135978-8 It is thrown away after it no longer works. The voltage of rechargeable batteries can be restored by passing an electric current through the battery. Car batteries, for example, work this way.. Rechargeable batteries are not always chosen. Each battery costs more to make, and has more dangerous chemicals than disposable batteries. Rechargeable batteries can be used for many smaller electronics such as MP3 players and flashlights. Almost all mobile phones and laptop computers use them. They are also used for car batteries. == Types of rechargeable batteries == * Lead-acid battery * Nickel-cadmium battery * Lithium-ion battery * Nickel-iron battery * Nickel metal-hydride battery * Nickelâ€“zinc battery == Related pages == *Battery *Dry cell *Table of batteries == References == Category:Batteries",
