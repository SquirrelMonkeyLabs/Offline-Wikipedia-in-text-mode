 "text": "Hope van Dyne is a fictional character played by Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie franchise, loosely based on the Marvel Comics character Hope Pym. She first appeared in the 2015 movie Ant-Man and later in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). Madeleine McGraw portrays a younger version of Van Dyne. Alternate versions of Van Dyne appear in the Disney+ animated series What If...? (2021â€“2024), also voiced by Lilly and McGraw. Van Dyne is noted for being the first superheroine to be a titular character in a MCU movie, preceding Captain Marvel, Black Widow, and Black Panther and inspiring the creation of comic superheroine Nadia van Dyne. She is the daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne, and a former chairwoman of the board of Pym Technologies. When Darren Cross attempted to create and sell a new weapon based on her father's Ant-Man Suit, van Dyne reunited with her father and, along with Scott Lang who succeeded Hank as Ant-Man, was able to defeat Cross. After these events, Pym found the possibility of saving his wife due to Lang's first experience in the Quantum Realm, from which van Dyne was finally being offered by her father a suit that belonged to her mother, therefore taking on the name of Wasp. Over the course of another year, van Dyne would train alongside Lang, while forming a romantic relationship with him, until she broke up because Lang's actions during the Clash of the Avengers resulted in her and her father being wanted by the FBI. Two years later, van Dyne, Pym, and Lang successfully managed to retrieve her mother from the Quantum Realm and also faced Ava Starr when she became a threat to their plan of rescue. Van Dyne also reconciled with Lang and resumed their relationship. Alongside her parents, van Dyne was among the half the population who turned to dust following Thanos' Snap. Five years later, during the Battle of Earth, van Dyne was resurrected, where she aided the Avengers in defeating Thanos and his army. After Thanos' army was disintegrated, van Dyne attended Tony Stark's funeral with Lang and her parents and later returned home to San Francisco to celebrate their victory with Cassie Lang. == Appearances == === Movie appearances === Year Movie Portrayed by 2015 Ant-Man Evangeline Lilly 2018 Ant-Man and the Wasp 2019 Avengers: Endgame 2023 Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania === Television appearances === Year Television series Seasons Episodes Portrayed by 2021-2024 What If...? 3 26 Evangeline Lilly (voice) Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters Category:Marvel Comics movie characters",
