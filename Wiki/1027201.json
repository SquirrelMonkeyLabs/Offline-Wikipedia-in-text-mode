It topped the single charts in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Switzerland and Zimbabwe. It went to the top ten in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The song is about a British man (Elton John), who is in love with a border guard named Nikita from the German Democratic Republic, who patrols the Berlin Wall. He cannot meet her, because he is not allowed to enter the country (the story takes place during the Cold War). The female border guard was played by the British actress Anya Major and the male border guard was played by the German actor Andreas Wisniewski. The music video for the song was directed by Ken Russell. == References == Category:1985 songs Category:Elton John songs Category:Cold War Category:Berlin Wall",
