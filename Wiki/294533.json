 "text": "Dorothy Wise (1914â€“1995) is an American professional pool player. She was born in Spokane, Washington. When she first started playing pool professionally, there were very few national tournaments for women. She won many local and state tournaments, so she called herself the world champion. The first national tournament for women happened in 1967. She won and kept winning for the next five years. She lost the title in 1972. She played in the final against 13-year-old Jean Balukas. She became a member of the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame in 1981. She was the first woman to be made a member. Dorothy learned to play pool from her husband, Jimmy Wise. He managed billiard parlors (where people play pool) in several cities around the western United States. He watched Dorothy win the first national championship in 1967, but died later that year. == References == Category:1914 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Cue sports Category:Sportspeople from Spokane, Washington",
