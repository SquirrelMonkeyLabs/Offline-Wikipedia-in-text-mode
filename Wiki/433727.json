 "text": "A loan shark is a person that sells loans with very high interest rates. People go to loan sharks for many reasons. It is often because no one else will lend them money. Loan sharks tend to ask for something beforehand, like someone's passport. Loan sharks are often illegal. Loan sharks are called what they are because they resemble sharks: aggressive, angry, and greedy. They can do many illegal things to just get repayment, like kidnapping or even killing.
