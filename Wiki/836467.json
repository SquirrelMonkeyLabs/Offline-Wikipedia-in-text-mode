 "text": "Loving v. Virginia was a unanimous 1967 United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruling which held that U.S. states cannot forbid people of different races from marrying each other, overturning the 1883 SCOTUS ruling in Pace v. Alabama. Loving v. Virginia was later used as inspiration for the 2015 SCOTUS ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that U.S. states cannot forbid people from marrying someone of the same sex. ==References== Category:20th century in Virginia Category:1967 in the United States Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States law",
