 "text": "Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) was a program run by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They surveyed the sky for near-Earth objects. NEAT was a program from December 1995 until April 2007. It was at GEODSS on Hawaii (Haleakala-NEAT; 566) and at the Palomar Observatory in California (Palomar- NEAT; 644). It discovered more than 40 thousand minor planets. NEAT has been one of the best programs in tracking minor planets. NEAT was the successor to the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS). == References == == Other websites == * Near Earth Asteroid Tracking Category:Solar System Category:Astronomical organizations Category:Organizations based in the United States",
