 "text": "Karl Schwarzschild (9 October 1873 â€“ 11 May 1916) was a German physicist and astronomer. Best known for his solution to Einstein's equations of general relativity, which describes the gravitational field outside a non-rotating black hole with no magnetic field. The equation describes how a particle moves space near this black hole (using spherical coordinates). (ds)^2=-c^2(1-\\frac{r_s}{r})(dt)^2+\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{r_s}{r})}(dr)^2+r^2(d\\theta)^2+r^2\\sin^2(\\theta)(d\\phi)^2 ds is the path it follows dt is the change in time dr is the change in radius d\\theta and d\\phi are the change in angle \\theta is also the angle r_s is the set radius limit of the heavy object r is how close the travelling object is to the heavy object c is the speed of light This equation is also known as the Schwarzschild metric or Schwarzschild solution.Czerniawski, Jan. , The possibility of a simple derivation of the Schwarzschild metric.
