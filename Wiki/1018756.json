 "text": "The International Marxist Group (IMG) was a Trotskyist group in Britain between 1968 and 1982. It was the British Section of the Fourth International. It had around 1,000 members and supporters in the late 1970s. In 1980, it had 682 members; by 1982, when it changed its name to the Socialist League, membership had fallen to 534. At that point all its members had joined the Labour Party. It supported The Black Dwarf, a newspaper edited by Tariq Ali which started in June 1968. In 1970 Red Mole was started. In May 1973, the fortnightly Red Mole was replaced by Red Weekly. In June 1977, Socialist Challenge replaced Red Weekly. In December 1982, when it renamed itself the Socialist League, it began publishing Socialist Action. ==References== Category:Socialist organisations in the United Kingdom",
