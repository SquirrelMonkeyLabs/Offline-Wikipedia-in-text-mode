He was apart of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). He was Chancellor of Germany and its first president during the Weimar period. Ebert was a social democrat. He became leader of the SPD in 1913, when the last leader August Bebel died. He was an important part of the German Revolution of 1918–19, and when Germany became a republic he became the first Chancellor. His goal was to make Germany more peaceful. He did this by putting down the Left-wing and Right-wing revolutions, working with the right-wing Freikorps and the left-wing Trade unionss. He was Chancellor until he died on 28 February 1925 from Septic Shock. He is praised for helping the Weimar Republic when it had only just been made, but people also say he was wrong for working with the right-wing, and that it helped Adolf Hitler come to power. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1871 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Chancellors of the Weimar Republic Category:German people of World War I Category:Members of the Reichstag (German Empire) Category:Members of the Reichstag (Weimar Republic) Category:Politicians from Heidelberg Category:Politicians of the Social Democratic Party of Germany Category:Presidents of the Weimar Republic Category:Presidents of Germany Category:Prussian politicians Category:20th- century presidents of Germany",
