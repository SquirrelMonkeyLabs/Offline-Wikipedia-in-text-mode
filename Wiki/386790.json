 "text": "Lifeline is a non-profit organisation that provides free, 24-hour telephone support to people in need. Lifeline does not make any profit. A Lifeline Assistance called Volunteer Crisis Supporters provides suicide prevention services (trying to persuade people not to kill themselves) and mental health support (helping with depression and other issues). They help people not only by telephone but face-to-face and online too. Most people that work at the telephone centres for Lifeline work for free. They are called volunteers. They are very well trained to help people with any problems. More than 400,000 calls are served by the Lifeline Assistance every year.Some Lifeline Centres also provide other support services that may have group support, assistance with food & bills and support for the old people. Lifeline has more than 260 retail outlets around Australia that sell clothes and furniture to make enough money to pay for training and office space they use. Some Lifeline Centres have few stores which helps them with day-to-day spending. Some lifelines can provide people in need with free mobile phones thanks to government grants. The 2010 report recorded 2,361 deaths by suicide in Australia, 480 more deaths than in 2007. ==References== Category:1963 establishments Category:1960s establishments in Australia Category:Non-profit organizations of Australia",
