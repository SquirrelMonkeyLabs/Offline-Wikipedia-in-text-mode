 "text": "The Chinese fire belly newt (Cynops orientalis) is a species of newts. They are small and will reach up to 2.2-4 inches (6-10 cm). They are black and have bright orange colors on their front side. They are commonly found in pet stores. They are sometimes confused with the Japanese fire belly newt. This is because of their small size and colors. However, the Chinese fire belly newt has smoother skin and a rounder tail than the Japanese Fire Belly Newt. ==References== * Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is of least concern *Chang, Mangven L.
