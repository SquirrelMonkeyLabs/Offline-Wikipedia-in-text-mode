The movie stars Fathia Youssouf, Médina El Aidi-Azouni, Esther Gohourou, Ilanah Cami-Goursolas and Maïmouna Gueye. The movie is about a French-Senegalese Muslim girl who becomes interested in internet culture, even though a lot of it is against her religion. The film was first shown at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January 2020. It was released in France on 19 August 2020, and to the rest of the world on 9 September 2020 on Netflix. Critics mainly said that the movie was good, but many people online did not like the movie as they thought it showed children in a sexual way. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation agreed with the people online, and said that Netflix should not have released the movie. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:2020 comedy movies Category:2020 drama movies Category:French comedy movies Category:French drama movies Category:Teen drama movies Category:Coming-of-age drama movies Category:Movies about puberty Category:Controversies",
