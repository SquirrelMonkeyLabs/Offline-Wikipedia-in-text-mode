 "text": "The Mount Malinao forest frog (Platymantis diesmosi) is a frog. It lives in the Philippines on Luzon Island. People have seen it in the forest between 900 and 1160 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 28.3-39.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog isabout 49.8-52.7 mm long. Unlike other frogs in Platymantis, it does not climb trees much. Instead it lives on the ground. It does have disks on its toes for climbing, but they are smaller than the disks of other frogs in Platymantis. This frog is dark brown in color with a white mark between its eyes. The tops of its legs are lighter brown with black marks. The iris of the eye is gold in color on top and darker gold on the bottom. ==Home== This frog lives in the place where water flows into the Tiwi River. This is where the people in the town of Tiwi get their drinking water. This means that the frog and the people need the same water to be clean. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because humans change the places where the frog lives. They build farms and cut down trees so animals can eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
