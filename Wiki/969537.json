 "text": "The rosy-faced lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis) is a genus of parrot. It is native to dry parts of Africa. It is often found in Angola and the Namib Desert. It is also known as the rosy-collared or peach-faced lovebird. The birds are very social animals. They are often found in small groups. They are often kept as pets. These lovebirds come in many different colors. Their plumage (feathers) is the same in both the male and females. Lovebirds are well known for the way they sleep. They sleep side-to-side and turn their face in towards each other. Females tear raw materials into long strips, \"twisty- tie\" them into their backs, and fly back to make a nest. == Taxonomy == The birds were first described by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1818. It was named Psittacus roseicollis at first. It was later moved to the genus Agapornis with the other lovebirds. == References == Category:True parrots Category:Birds of Africa",
