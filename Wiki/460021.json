 "text": "The 2013–14 UEFA Champions League was the 59th season of Europe's top club football tournament. It used to be called the European Champion Clubs' Cup but was renamed the UEFA Champions League. The final match took place between Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid in Lisbon, Portugal. This was special because it was the fifth final with teams from the same country, and the first time both finalists were from the same city (after the finals of 2000, 2003, 2008, and 2013). Real Madrid won their 10th title in extra time after tying the game late in the second half and winning 4–1 in extra time. In a new development, the clubs that made it to the group stage also qualified for the newly created 2013–14 UEFA Youth League, a competition for players aged 19 or under. == Groups == ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Group E=== ===Group F=== ===Group G=== ===Group H=== == Knockout phase == === Bracket === === Final === == Statistics == === Hat-tricks === Player For Against Result Date Cristiano Ronaldo Real Madrid Galatasaray 6-1 (A) 17 September 2013 Lionel Messi Barcelona Ajax 4-0 (H) 18 September 2013 Konstantinos Mitroglou Olympiakos Anderlecht 3-0 (A) 2 October 2013 Zlatan Ibrahimović4 Paris Saint-Germain Anderlecht 5-0 (A) 23 October 2013 Álvaro Negredo Manchester City CSKA Moscow 5-2 (H) 5 November 2013 Arturo Vidal Juventus Copenhagen 3-1 (H) 27 November 2013 Neymar Barcelona Celtic 6-1 (H) 11 December 2013 Robin van Persie Manchester United Olympiakos 3-0 (H) 19 March 2014 ==Notes== ==References== Category:UEFA Champions League seasons Category:2014 in association football Category:2013 in association football",
