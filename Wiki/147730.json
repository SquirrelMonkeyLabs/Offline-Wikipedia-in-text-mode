 "text": "Winning the Oil Endgame is a 2005 book by Amory B. Lovins, published by the Rocky Mountain Institute. It talks about four ways to reduce oil (petroleum) dependence in the United States: *Using oil more efficiently (pp. 29–102). *Substituting other liquids for oil (pp. 103–111). *Substituting saved natural gas for oil (pp. 111–122). *Replacing oil with hydrogen (pp. 228–242). ==Problems and solutions== The authors suggest that oil dependence is a problem we need no longer have. U.S. oil dependence can be profitably eliminated by proven and attractive technologies. The authors argue that America can lead the world into the post-petroleum era and create a vibrant economy.
