He is worshipped in Shinto. He is important in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, two old books about myths. Ōkuninushi is one of the most important gods, along with Amaterasu and Susanoo. He is more important in Izumo Shinto than Ise Shinto. Some stories say Susanoo is Ōkuninushi's ancestor and others say he is his father. In the stories, Ōkuninushi is in charge of the gods who protect the earth. He used to be the ruler of a place called Ashihara no Nakatsukuni. But when the gods in the sky asked him to give up his power, Ōkuninushi agreed and went to a hidden world. He was given that world to rule. Later, Amaterasu's grandson, Ninigi, came to Ashihara no Nakatsukuni to rule it. Ninigi became the first Japanese emperor's ancestor. Ōkuninushi is associated with the province of Izumo. This region may have been taken over by the Yamato court, and his surrender to the gods of heaven in myth might reflect this. The Fudoki, a gazetteer report of Izumo province from the early 7th century, contains many myths about Ōkuninushi and related deities. He is also featured in the Fudoki of other provinces like Harima. Ōkuninushi is known for having many romantic affairs with goddesses, resulting in the birth of many divine offspring, including the gods Kotoshironushi and Takeminakata. Ōkuninushi is worshiped in many Shinto shrines across Japan, but the most famous one is the Grand Shrine of Izumo in Shimane. The Izumo Taishakyō group, which is based in this shrine, considers him their central deity. Ōkuninushi was also combined with the Buddhist deity Daikokuten before the Meiji period, when Buddhism and Shinto were blended. == Related pages == * Susanoo * Kotoshironushi * Izumo-taisha == References == == Bibliography == * Aoki, Michiko Y., tr.
