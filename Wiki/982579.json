 "text": "U-Haul is a company that provides truck rentals and moving boxes. It has been active since 1945 and started from the need of it. In 1945, Leonard Shoen and his wife wanted to move from Los Angeles to Portland and found out nobody would rent them an one-way trailer. Shoen, who had just gotten out from the US Navy from World War II, found a need to have families move locations on their own. He started U-Haul at that year, with the company comparing the trucks to the covered wagons of the early frontier. The trucks were originally painted black and were hard to see, but were later painted orange and white when Shoen got hit in a four-way intersection. People in California from 2021 had moved out so much that U-Haul ran out of trucks. There is a lot of business from California and New York. There are also a lot of people moving into Chicago. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:American transport companies Category:1945 establishments in the United States",
