 "text": "An oxide is a chemical compound containing at least one oxygen atom and at least one atom of one other element. Most of the Earth's crust consists of oxides (mainly silica). Oxides can be made when elements are oxidized by air (when oxygen in the air reacts with the element). Some common oxides are: *Water (hydrogen oxide) (H2O) *Iron(III) oxide (Rust) (Fe2O3) *Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) *Lead(II) oxide (PbO) *Calcium oxide (CaO) *Carbon dioxide (CO2) *Carbon monoxide (CO) *Magnesium oxide (Magnesia) (MgO) *Phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) *Sulfur dioxide (SO2) *Sulfur trioxide (SO3) *Silicon dioxide (SiO2) *Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) (N2O) *Zinc oxide (ZnO) *Copper(I) oxide (CuO) and Copper(II) oxide (Cu2O) Category:Anions",
