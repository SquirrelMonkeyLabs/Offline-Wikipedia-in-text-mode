 "text": "Hippos (). or Sussita (Aramaic, ) is an ancient city. It was an archaeological site east of the Sea of Galilee. It is near Golan Heights. Hippos was a Hellenistic city. It was in the northern Jordan Valley.Josephus, Antiquities (book 17, chapter 11, verse 4). It was part of the Decapolis. The Decapolis was a group of 10 cities that were part of the Greco-Roman culture. They were more similar to this culture even though many people in the area spoke Semitic languages. Later, most people in Hippos were Christian. There was less Christianity in the area by the end of the Byzantine period and through the Early Muslim period. Hippos was abandoned after the 749 earthquake. ==References== ==Other websites== * Full list of Hippos related publications and links * Hippos (Sussita) – Excavation Project. * Pan at Hippos, BAR, November–December 2015. * \"Antiochia Hippos: Revealing a lost city of the Roman Decapolis\", Current World Archaeology 69, 2015. * \"The Spade Hits Sussita\", Forty Groundbreaking Articles from Forty Years of Biblical Archaeology Review, November 2015. * Explanatory signs in English and in Hebrew set at Hippos by the expedition (2014). * Pictures of Hippos ==Further reading== *Bagatti, Bellarmino. \"Hippos-Susita, an Ancient Episcopal See.\" Ancient Christian Villages of Galilee.
