 "text": "The mass number (symbol: A) of an atom is the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in the nucleus. The mass number is different for each isotope of a chemical element. We write a mass number after an element's name or as a superscript to the left of an element's symbol. For example, the most common isotope of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. We write it as carbon-12 or 12C. Mass number is not the same as: * atomic number (symbol: Z), which is the number of protons in a nucleus of an atom * atomic mass (symbol: ma), which is the mass of a single atom, commonly expressed in unified atomic mass units * relative atomic mass (symbol: Ar, also called atomic weight), which is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons (N) in a given nucleus: N = A âˆ’ Z. The mass number is not shown on the periodic table. For each element, what is shown is the standard atomic weight and the atomic number. == References == Category:Chemistry Category:Nuclear physics",
