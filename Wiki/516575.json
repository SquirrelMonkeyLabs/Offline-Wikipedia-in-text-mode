 "text": "The 2008 Detroit Lions season was the 79th football season of the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). It was their third year under head coach Rod Marinelli. In 2008, the Lions had one of the worst seasons of any major American pro sports team. They lost all 16 of their regular season games. They were the first NFL team to finish a season with no wins and 16 losses after their loss to the Green Bay Packers. They were the second team with no wins after the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Matt Millen was fired during the bye week of the season and the rest of the staff were fired after the season was over. In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became the second team to lose all 16 regular season games. == Roster == Detroit Lions 2008 final roster Quarterbacks * 11 Daunte Culpepper * 12 Drew Henson * 6 Dan Orlovsky * 5 Drew Stanton Running Backs * 36 Aveion Cason * 45 Jerome Felton FB * 32 Rudi Johnson * 44 Moran Norris FB * 34 Kevin Smith Wide Receivers * 19 Keary Colbert * 10 Chris Hannon * 80 Adam Jennings * 81 Calvin Johnson * 16 John Standeford * 17 Travis Taylor Tight Ends * 82 Casey FitzSimmons FB * 86 Michael Gaines * 83 John Owens Offensive Linemen * 76 Jeff Backus T * 77 Gosder Cherilus T * 74 Damion Cook G/T * 71 Junius Coston G * 72 George Foster T * 67 Andy McCollum C * 66 Stephen Peterman G * 51 Dominic Raiola C * 63 Manny Ramirez G Defensive Linemen * 97 Ikaika Alama-Francis DE * 92 Cliff Avril DE * 75 Shaun Cody DT * 98 Landon Cohen DT * 91 Chuck Darby DT * 96 Andre Fluellen DT * 79 Langston Moore DT * 93 Corey Smith DE * 99 Dewayne White DE Linebackers * 46 Darnell Bing OLB * 52 Anthony Cannon OLB * 53 Paris Lenon ILB * 55 Ryan Nece OLB * 50 Ernie Sims OLB Defensive Backs * 28 Leigh Bodden CB * 27 Daniel Bullocks SS * 21 Travis Fisher CB * 35 LaMarcus Hicks SS * 24 Kalvin Pearson FS * 33 Chris Roberson CB * 38 Ramzee Robinson CB * 39 Stuart Schweigert FS * 30 Dexter Wynn CB Special Teams * 4 Jason Hanson K * 2 Nick Harris P * 48 Don Muhlbach LS Reserve Lists * 42 Gerald Alexander FS (IR) * 13 Reggie Ball WR (IR) * 40 Jon Bradley FB (IR) * 29 Brian Calhoun RB (IR) * 89 Dan Campbell TE (IR) * 95 Jared DeVries DE (IR) * 57 Jordon Dizon ILB (IR) * 74 Jon Dunn OT (IR) * 87 Mike Furrey WR (IR) * 8 Jon Kitna QB (IR) * 60 Shemiah LeGrande DT (IR) * 59 Alex Lewis OLB (IR) * 84 Shaun McDonald WR (IR) * 64 Edwin Mulitalo G (IR) * 78 Cory Redding DT (IR) * 26 Dwight Smith SS (IR) * 23 Keith Smith CB (IR) * 31 Stanley Wilson CB (IR) Practice Squad * 62 Ben Claxton C/G * 25 Dowayne Davis S * 39 Allen Ervin RB * 18 Eric Fowler WR * 54 Chris Graham ILB * 94 Rudolph Hardie DE * 85 Jake Nordin TE * 49 Jeff Shoate CB Unsigned Draft Picks * 47 Caleb Campbell OLB/S Rookies in italics == Schedule == ===Preseason=== Week Date Kickoff Opponent Results Game Site TV NFL Recap Final score Team record 1 August 7, 2008 7:00 PM EDT New York Giants W 13–10 1–0 Ford Field Lions TV Network Recap 2 August 17, 2008 7:30 PM EDT at Cincinnati Bengals W 27–10 2–0 Paul Brown Stadium Lions TV Network Recap 3 August 23, 2008 4:00 PM Cleveland Browns W 26–6 3–0 Ford Field Lions TV Network Recap 4 August 28, 2008 6:30 PM EDT at Buffalo Bills W 14–6 4–0 Ralph Wilson Stadium Lions TV Network Recap ===Regular season=== Week Date Kickoff Opponent Results Game Site TV NFL Recap Final score Team record 1 September 7, 2008 1:00 PM EDT at Atlanta Falcons L 34–21 0–1 Georgia Dome FOX Recap 2 September 14, 2008 1:00 PM EDT Green Bay Packers L 48–25 0–2 Ford Field FOX Recap 3 September 21, 2008 4:05 PM EDT at San Francisco 49ers L 31–13 0–3 Candlestick Park FOX Recap 4 Bye 5 October 5, 2008 1:00 PM EDT Chicago Bears L 34–7 0–4 Ford Field FOX Recap 6 October 12, 2008 1:00 PM EDT at Minnesota Vikings L 12–10 0–5 Hubert H.
