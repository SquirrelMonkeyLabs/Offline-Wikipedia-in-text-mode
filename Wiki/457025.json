 "text": "Montessori education is an education method that was started by Maria Montessori. The idea is to focus more on the natural interest of a child and hands-on learning rather than a fixed plan. The basic idea is covered in the phrase \"Help me, so I can do it myself\". The idea was started by Maria Montessori, in the early 20th century. Montessori was a doctor of medicine. During her life, she worked at a mental health institution, where she also had to look after disabled children. She found out that many of them were not mentally retarded, they simply didn't get the attention they needed. Based on the ideas of Édouard Séguin, she developed special learning tools. With these tools, she could make them curious, and help them focus on learning new things. Category:Education",
