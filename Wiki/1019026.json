 "text": "576i is a type of digital video. It is standard-definition, which means it does not have high quality. It was first used to change old analog television into digital TV in many countries that use 50 Hz electricity. Because of its association with older colour encoding systems, it is often referred to as PAL, PAL/SECAM or SECAM when compared to its 60 Hz NTSC colour-encoded counterpart, 480i. 576 identifies a vertical line count of 576 and the i identifies it as an interlaced resolution. The refresh rate, 50 Hz, is sometimes including when finding out the video mode, i.e. 576i50; another notation is the frame rate, endorsed by both the International telecommunications Union in BT.601\"Recommendation ITU-R BT.601-7 : Studio encoding parameters of digital television for standard 4:3 and wide-screen 16:9 aspect ratios\" and SMPTE in SMPTE 259M to make it 576i/25. == Related pages == * 480i, 1080p, 720p == References == Category:Television technology",
