 "text": "Gay bars are drinking establishments that cater to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. The term gay is used as an inclusive concept for LGBT communities. Gay bars once served as the centre of gay culture. They were one of the few places people with same-sex orientations and gender-variant identities could openly socialize. Other names include boy bar, girl bar, lesbian bar or dyke bar. The Stonewall Inn in New York City is one example of a gay/lesbian bar. The gay rights movement was born there. ==References== Category:Places where alcohol is served Category:LGBT",
