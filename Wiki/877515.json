At only in length, it once had the distinction of being the shortest signed Interstate Highway in the country. It is a spur of I-75 into downtown Detroit, ending at the unsigned Business Spur Interstate 375 (BS I-375), better known as Jefferson Avenue. The freeway opened on June 12, 1964. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) announced in 2013 that it may remove I-375 in the future, and in December 2017 MDOT started planning for to change I-375 from a freeway to a city street. ==References== 375 Category:State highways in Michigan",
