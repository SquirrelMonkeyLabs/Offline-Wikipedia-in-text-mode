 "text": "Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, also called Kartarpur Sahib, is a Gurdwara in Kartarpur, located in Shakargarh, Narowal District, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is built on the historic site where the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, settled and assembled the Sikh community after his missionary travels (udasis to Haridwar, Mecca-Medina, Lanka, Baghdad, Kashmir and the Great Himalayas) and lived for 18 years until his death in 1539. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Golden Temple in Amritsar and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib. It is also claimed to be the largest gurdwara in the world. This Sikhi Holy site is to be considered as the \"National Sikh Temple of Pakistan\", a potential for Punjabi Indian and all Universal Sikh Yatris respectively. ==References== Category:World Heritage Sites in Pakistan Category:Religion in Pakistan Category:Narowal District Category:History of Pakistan Category:Sikhism",
