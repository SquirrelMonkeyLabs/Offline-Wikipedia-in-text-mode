 "text": "The dalton or unified atomic mass unit, abbreviated as u, amu or Da) is a unit of measurement for measuring the mass of atoms, equalling ¹⁄₁₂ of the mass of the carbon-12 isotope, the most abundant form of carbon atoms in nature. * * * ==History== The unit is named after English chemist and physicist John Dalton (1766 – 1844). 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66 × 10-27 kg, or 1.66 × 10-24 g. ==Atomic physics== In atomic physics, 1 amu can be expressed as roughly 931 MeV (M = 106, 1 eV ≈ 1.60 × 10-19 J) due to mass-energy equivalence, illustrated by ΔE = Δmc2. ==Related pages== * Nuclear physics * Quantum physics * Electromagnetism * Radioactive decay * Nuclear binding energy ==References== Category:Physics Category:Science Category:Chemistry Category:Units of mass Category:Analytical chemistry",
