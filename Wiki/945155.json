 "text": "The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA, ) is the French authority responsible for safety investigations of accidents and serious incidents involving civil aircraft. The BEA is responsible for investigating when the event takes place in France or in International airspace and involves a French aircraft. They may also assist foreign investigation authorities at their request, in particular, BEA technical assistance is often sought by nations that do not wish to engage with the American FAA for political reasons. Representatives of the aircraft manufacturer or airline may assist the BEA as technical advisers. In addition, the BEA provides technical assistance when a foreign authority calls on its skills, most often in terms of reading flight recorders. They are also the investigating party for all Airbus aircraft, BEA reports are made public. ==References== == Other websites == *BEA website *BEA website * Category:Aviation organizations Category:Aviation safety Category:1946 establishments in France Category:Government agencies",
