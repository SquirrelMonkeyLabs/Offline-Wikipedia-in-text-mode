 "text": "Queen Anne Boleyn’s direct bloodline ended with the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. However, another branch of the Boleyn family line lives on. Anne Boleyn’s sister, Mary Boleyn, gave birth to several children: Catherine Carey, Henry Carey, and Unknown male Stafford. In 1923, one of Mary Boleyn’s direct descendants, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, married the then-Prince Albert, later known as king George VI. Their union produced two daughters: Princess Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret. When Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne, Britain once again had one of the Boleyn ancestor on the throne, and once again a queen regnant named Elizabeth. Today, the Boleyn ancestry lives on in Queen Elizabeth II’s four children. King Charles III, his two sons; Prince William and Prince Harry, William’s children; Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, and Harry’s two children; Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.
