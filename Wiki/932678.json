 "text": "A ballot is a system used to cast votes in an election and may be found as a piece of paper or a small ball used in secret voting. It was invented in Italy around the 16th century. Each voter uses one ballot, and ballots are not shared. In the simplest elections, a ballot might be a scrap of paper. The voter casts their ballot in a box at a polling station. In British English, this is usually called a \"ballot paper\". ==References== Category:Voting",
