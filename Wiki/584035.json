The difference between the two is 12 days for Julian dates prior to 1 March 1900 [Gregorian 14 March] and 13 days for Julian dates on or after 1 March 1900. Thus, Stanislavski was born on the 17 January according to the Gregorian calendar that is in use today, while his birthday was 5 January according to the Julian calendar that was in use at the time. For more information on the difference between the two systems, see the article Adoption of the Gregorian calendar. Dates after 1 February 1918 are presented as normal. | birth_place = Moscow, Russian Empire | death_date = | death_place = Moscow, Soviet Union | occupation = Actor Theatre director Theatre theorist | movement = Naturalism Symbolism Psychological realism Socialist realism | spouse = Maria Petrovna Perevostchikova (stage name: Maria Lilina) | notableworks = Founder of the MAT Stanislavski's 'system' An Actor's Work An Actor's Work on a Role My Life in Art}} Konstantin Sergeievich Stanislavski (né Alexeiev; ; 7 August 1938) was a Russian actor and director.Stanislavski's first name is also transliterated as \"Constantin\", while his surname is also transliterated as \"Stanislavsky\" and \"Stanislavskii\". As discussed below, \"Stanislavski\" is a stage name. He was widely known as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed created a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation.Benedetti (1999b, 254), Carnicke (2000, 12), Leach (2004, 14), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1). His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his 'system' of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique.Carnicke (2000, 16), Golub (1998a, 1032), and Milling and Ley (2001, 1). Stanislavski began developing a 'grammar' of acting in 1906; his initial choice to call it his System struck him as too dogmatic, so he wrote it as his 'system' (without the capital letter and in inverted commas) to indicate the provisional nature of the results of his investigations—modern scholarship and the standard edition of Stanislavski's works follow that practice; see Benedetti (1999a, 169), Gauss (1999, 3—4), Milling and Ley (2001, 1), and Stanislavski (1938) and (1957). ==Notes== Category:1863 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Russian stage actors Category:Russian educators Category:Russian theatre directors Category:Actors from Moscow",
