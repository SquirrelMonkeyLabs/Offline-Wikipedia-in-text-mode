 "text": "Motörhead was an English rock band. The band was started in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Ian Fraser “Lemmy” Kilmister. They are thought to be one of the bands that started the new wave of British heavy metal in the late 1970s. The word motorhead is a name for someone who likes cars, but in British slang it’s a name for a meth addict/speed freak. Motörhead played heavy metal music very fast. This was different from how other bands played it at the time. Many listeners call them the first speed metal or thrash metal band. Motörhead are a main influence on other bands that play those styles. Lemmy did not like his band being called anything other than just a rock and roll band. Fans of punk music and metal music liked Motörhead. Their songs have words about war, drug abuse, and sex. They also sing about gambling in their most popular song, \"Ace of Spades\". Motörhead are famous to fans of professional wrestling for making wrestler Triple H's theme song. He started using Motörhead's music in 2000. The song is called \"The Game\". The band has played the song live at two WrestleMania events. Motörhead was listed at number 26 on VH1's \"The 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" TV show. The band broke up in 2015 when Lemmy died of cancer on December 28, only four days after his 70th birthday. The band was added into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020. == Discography == === Albums === * 1977 - Motörhead * 1979 - Overkill * 1979 - Bomber * 1979 - On Parole * 1980 - Ace of Spades * 1981 - No Sleep 'til Hammersmith * 1982 - Iron Fist * 1983 - Another Perfect Day * 1985 - No Remorse * 1986 - Orgasmatron * 1987 - Rock 'n' Roll * 1988 - No Sleep at All * 1991 - 1916 * 1992 - March or Die * 1993 - Bastards * 1995 - Sacrifice * 1996 - Overnight Sensation * 1998 - Snake Bite Love * 1999 - Everything Louder Than Everyone Else * 2000 - We Are Motörhead * 2002 - Hammered * 2003 - Live at Brixton Academy * 2004 - Inferno * 2006 - Kiss of Death * 2008 - Motörizer * 2010 - The Wörld Is Yours * 2013 - Aftershock * 2015 - Bad Magic == Notes == Category:1975 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1970s establishments in England Category:2015 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:1970s British music groups Category:1980s British music groups Category:1990s British music groups Category:2000s British music groups Category:2010s British music groups Category:English hard rock bands Category:English heavy metal bands Category:Musical groups established in 1975 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2015 Category:Speed metal bands Category:Thrash metal bands Category:21st-century disestablishments in England",
