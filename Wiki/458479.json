McCarthy joined the New York City Police Department in 1981 at age 22. He rose through the ranks and became Deputy Commissioner of Operations in 2000. In 2006, McCarthy left his position with the New York Police Department to take over the Police Department of Newark, New Jersey. McCarthy was hired by Mayor Rahm Emanuel to take over the Chicago Police Department shortly after Emanuel's election in early 2011. On December 1, 2015, the mayor asked for McCarthy's resignation. He said this was because public trust in the leadership of the city's police department had been shaken and that McCarthy had become \"an issue\" and \"a distraction.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/us/chicago-police-rahm-emanuel-laquan- mcdonald.html \"Mayor Rahm Emanuel Fires Chicago Police Superintendent,\" New York Times on line, by MONICA DAVEY and RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA; accessed 2015.12.01 On March 21, 2018, McCarthy announced his candidacy for Mayor of Chicago in the 2019 election.
