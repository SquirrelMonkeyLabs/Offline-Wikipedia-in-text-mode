Movie critic Roger Ebert rated the movie a rare zero-stars rating and listed it as one of his most hated movies of all-time. He described the movie as: \"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels[...]. The day may come when Freddy Got Fingered is seen as a milestone of neo-surrealism. The day may never come when it is seen as funny.\" It is considered one of the worst movies of all time, but has a cult following. == Cast == * Tom Green as Gordon \"Gord\" Brody * Rip Torn as James \"Jim\" Brody * Marisa Coughlan as Betty * Eddie Kaye Thomas as Frederick \"Freddy\" Brody * Harland Williams as Darren * Anthony Michael Hall as Dave Davidson * Julie Hagerty as Julie Brody * Drew Barrymore as Davidson's receptionist * Shaquille O'Neal as Shaquille ==References== == Other websites == * Category:2001 comedy movies Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:2000s black comedy movies Category:American black comedy movies Category:Cult movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies about dysfunctional families Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Movies set in Oregon Category:Movies set in Pakistan Category:Portland, Oregon",
