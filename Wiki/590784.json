 "text": "Whang-od Oggay (born 17 February 1917 or 6 March 1919) is a Filipino tattoo artist from Buscalan, Tinglayan, Kalinga, Philippines. She is thought as the last mambabatok (traditional Kalinga tattooist) from the Butbut people in Buscalan Kalinga and the oldest tattoo artist in the Philippines. She has been tattooing headhunters and women of the indigenous people of Butbut in Buscalan Kalinga for more than 80 years, but the Butbut warriors who used to earn tattoos through protecting villages or killing enemies no longer exist. Instead, Whang-od now applies the traditional art form to tourists visiting Buscalan. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1917 births Category:Living people Category:Centenarians Category:Filipino artists Category:People from Cordillera Administrative Region",
