 "text": "A coast guard is an organization that protects people at sea. The role of the coast guard varies greatly by country. The coast guard is sometimes part of a military or a semi-military organization, or it can be a law enforcement (policing) agency. However, the coast guard is always separate from the navy. For example, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a branch of the military and has duties that include searching for people, ships and boats in danger at sea; rescuing those in danger; and law enforcement to protect people from terrorism and crimes at sea. The coast guard can also become part of the Navy in a time of war. By contrast, Her Majesty's Coastguard in the United Kingdom is neither a military force nor a law enforcement agency. Its only job is to lead searches and rescues for those in danger at sea, and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution launches most rescue boats. == Related pages == * Pakistan Coast Guard ==Other websites== *USCG website *USCG boating office",
