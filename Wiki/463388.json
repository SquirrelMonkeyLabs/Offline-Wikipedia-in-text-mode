 "text": "Sacrifice (2012) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on May 13, 2012 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the eighth Sacrifice event that TNA held and was also the fifth event in TNA's 2012 pay-per-view schedule. There were eight matches on the card. The main event saw Bobby Roode defeat Rob Van Dam in a Ladder match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Sacrifice gained mixed to positive reviews. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter thought of the show as an, \"easy thumbs up show\", he would also said, \"I will admit to be bored through some of the early parts of it. That wasn't necessarily due to the show not being good, but mainly because I'm rather cold on the product at the moment...Things really picked up for the last three matches. Austin Aries had his breakout match in TNA tonight. If, and that's a big IF, TNA follows up on it properly, they may have something here with Austin Aries.\" ==Matches== # Results Stipulations Times 1 Christopher Daniels and Kazarian defeated Samoa Joe and Magnus (c) Tag team match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship 10:54 2 Gail Kim (c) defeated Brooke Tessmacher Singles match for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship 7:26 3 Devon (c) defeated Robbie E and Robbie T Three-Way match for the TNA Television Championship 5:28 4 Mr. Anderson defeated Jeff Hardy Singles match 11:47 5 Crimson defeated Eric Young (with ODB) Singles match 6:08 6 Austin Aries defeated Bully Ray Singles match 13:18 7 Kurt Angle defeated A.J.
