 "text": "Nocturnal transportation is an all-encompassing name for public transportation that operates during the night. Nocturnal transport is operated by governments and municipalities, and operates mainly in large cities. Nocturnal transport is divided into two main types: urban nocturnal transport and inter-urban nocturnal transport. Urban night traffic is less common, and has flourished mainly in recent years. Transportation lines, which include mainly trams and buses, are usually marked with different numbers than usual, and their routes are also different, stopping at fewer stations. By contrast, inter-city night transport is very common, as many prefer to travel by train, for example, during the night, and arrive at their destination the next morning. Category:Bus transport",
