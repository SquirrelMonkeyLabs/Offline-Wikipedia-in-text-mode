 "text": "Gráinne O'Malley, also known as Grace O'Malley or \"The Pirate Queen\" (citation needed), was a pirate from Ireland who lived from around 1530 to about 1603. She hailed from the Ó Máille dynasty in the western part of Ireland, and her father was Eóghan Dubhdara Ó Máille. After her father's death, she married Dónal an Chogaidh Ó Flaithbheartaigh, which added to her wealth and influence. She owned a significant number of cows and horses. In 1593, when English soldiers captured her sons and half-brother, Gráinne sailed to England to seek Queen Elizabeth I's help in getting them released. Gráinne's life story mostly comes from English sources, as she isn't mentioned much in Irish records. However, in Irish folklore, she's known as Gráinne Mhaol or Gráinne Ní Mháille, and is celebrated as a significant figure in Irish history. During Gráinne's lifetime, Ireland was undergoing significant changes due to increase in English control. Gráinne's legacy is told through songs, stories, plays, and landmarks inspired by her life. Today, she's considered to be a symbol of female empowerment and strength; fighting for her and her people's freedom, and challenging authority. == References == Category:1530s births Category:1600s deaths Category:History of Ireland Category:Pirates",
