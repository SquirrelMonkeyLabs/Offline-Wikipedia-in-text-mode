 "text": "The Tomkinson Ranges is a mountain range in the northwest corner of South Australia. The range consists of sandstone hills, surrounded by spinifex grasslands. Several rock holes are located in and around the hills. The mountains were named after politician Samuel Tomkinson (1851â€“1900). The explorer William Gosse named them when he passed through the region in the early 1870s. Ernest Giles and his team reached the ranges shortly after, and set up a base here from which to explore the Gibson and Great Victoria Deserts. Numerous prospecting expeditions were made through the region until the 1930s. Together with the Mann Ranges, the Tomkinson Ranges are an important part of the Pitjantjatjara homeland. The communities of Kalka and Pipalyatjara are located at the base of the mountains. ==References== Category:Mountain ranges of Australia Category:Mountains of South Australia",
