 "text": "In statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given amount based on observed data. The rule (the estimator), the amount that is being measured (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are different. An estimator of a parameter \\theta is often written as \\hat\\theta. If the expected value of the estimator is equal to the parameter, then the estimator is called unbiased. Otherwise, it is called biased. == Related pages == * Efficiency (statistics) ==References== ==Other websites== *Fundamentals on Estimation Theory Category:Statistics",
