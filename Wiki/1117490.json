His mother died when he was five years old. His paternal grandmother, Ferdinandina, belonged to the Hungarian Inkey noble family. As a result, he moved to Hungary with his grandmother and became fluent in Hungarian. He lived in Murarátka, Hungary, until 1945. Throughout his career, he specialized in the medieval period, focusing on the Crusader states, Cilician Armenia, the Kingdom of Cyprus, and the Byzantine Empire. A polyglot, he wrote in German, French, Hungarian, Italian, and English. He married four times. His first marriage was to Sakuntala Blücher-Wahlstatt in 1944 in Muraszemenye. They had a daughter, Romedia Domenica, in 1945, but Sakuntala died a week after giving birth. In 1947, he married Countess Maria de Los Mercedes Wolff Metternich in Freiburg im Breisgau, and they had a daughter, Benedetta, in 1948, but divorced in 1949. His third marriage was to Rosamund Muriel Berkeley-Hill in 1952 in Vienna, and his final marriage was to Natalie von Schubert in 1968 in Rome. ==Selected publications== *The Rupenides, Hethumides and Lusignans; the structure of the Armeno-Cilician dynasties (1963) *L'empereur Isaac de Chypre et sa fille (1155–1207) (1968) *Les Ibelin aux XIIIe et XIVe siècles (1977–1979) *Le royaume et l'Église de Chypre face au Grand Schisme (1378–1417) d'après les Registres des Archives du Vatican (1982) *Familles de l'Orient latin XIIe-XIVe siècles (1983) ==References== Category:1916 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Strasbourg",
