 "text": "The HSBC Group is a British banking group, that is the second largest in the world. It was founded in 1865, Hong Kong, by the Scottish banker, Thomas Sutherland. Now, it's head office is in London, in the United Kingdom, in the building known as 8 Canada Square. Although it is a British Bank, it owns lots of banks in other countries around the world, including some in the United States, France, Spain, Argentina, Russia, and China (PR, China). It has a dual listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange, ranked 38th in Forbes' 2022 list of large companies. However, HSBC has been involved in controversies, including fines for money laundering and accusations of setting up tax avoidance schemes. ==Logo== The group announced in November 1998 that the HSBC brand and the hexagon symbol would be adopted as the unified brand in all the markets where HSBC operates, with the aim of enhancing recognition of the group and its values by customers, shareholders and staff throughout the world. The hexagon symbol was originally adopted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as its logo in 1983. It was developed from the bank's house flag, a white rectangle divided diagonally to produce a red hourglass shape. Like many other Hong Kong company flags that originated in the 19th century, and because of its founder's nationality, the design was based on the cross of Saint Andrew. The logo was designed by Austrian graphic artist Henry Steiner. In 2018, HSBC made minor changes to their logo. The wordmark was repositioned from left to the right, resized to be smaller, and was switched from Serif to a licensed custom font called Univers Next for HSBC. The logo red was made slightly darker red. ==Leadership== * Group Chairman: Sir Mark Tucker (October 2017 to present)HSBC Leadership (Board of Directors) * Group Chief Executive: Georges Elhedery (September 2024 to present) ===List of former group chairmen=== The position of Group Chairman was formed in 1991; the preceding position, Chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, has remained a separate position. # Sir William Purves (1991–1998); concurrently Group Chief Executive from 1991 to 1993 # Sir John Bond (1998–2006) # The Lord Green (2006–2010) # Sir Douglas Flint (2010–2017) ===List of former group chief executives=== The position of Group Chief Executive was formed in 1991; the preceding position, chief executive of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, has remained a separate position. # William Purves (1991–1993) # John Bond (1993–1998) # Keith Whitson (1998–2003) # Stephen Green (2003–2006) # Michael Geoghegan (2007–2010) # Stuart Gulliver (2011–2018) # John Flint (2018–2019) # Noel Quinn (2020–2024) ==References== == Other websites == * Category:HSBC Category:Banks of England Category:1865 establishments in the United Kingdom",
