 "text": "Manuel Arturo Merino de Lama (born 20 August 1961) is a Peruvian politician and agronomist who was the Acting President of Peru from 10 November until his resignation five days later on 15 November 2020 following massive protests. He is the shortest serving president of Peru, serving only five days though he was never really president. He came to power after the removal of his predecessor, Martín Vizcarra. Duee to the vacancies of the two vice presidential offices, Merino who was the President of the Congress at that time became acting president as based on the Perivian constitution, if the two vice presidential offices are vacant, then the president of the congress will ascend to the presidency. However, because of massive protests at that time, Merino was forced to resign and was succeeded by Francisco Sagasti. == Presidency == On 9 November 2020, the Congress impeached and removed President Martín Vizcarra from office on the grounds of \"moral incapacity\", a vague term dating back to the 19th century. The move was seen as a coup by many Peruvians,political analysts and media outlets in the country, with Vizcarra's removal resulting with the beginning of the 2020 Peruvian protests. The following day, as the President of the Peruvian Congress, Merino became the new president of Peru following the line of succession established in the nation's constitution, forming a far-right government. Five days after taking office, he resigned from the presidency as a result of two deaths in the protests. He was succeeded by Francisco Sagasti. == References == Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Peru Category:Current national leaders Category:Tumbes Region",
