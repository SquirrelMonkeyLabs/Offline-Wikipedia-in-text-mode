There are two ways to take the TOEIC test. One is the TOEIC Secure Program (SP), the other is the TOEIC Institutional Testing Program (ITP). The SP is offered at a set place and time, and test takers go there for the exam. In the ITP, a group such as a university gives the test when and where they like. Groups giving the ITP test must follow the test rules. === TOEIC Scandal in Japan === The Institute for International Business Communication had a scandal in 2009. The IIBC’s 92 year-old Chairman Yaeji Watanabe made his girlfriend's son Chairman of the IIBC Board of Directors. Watanabe forced out half the board of directors. Also, Watanabe only worked about one day a week. Watanabe's salary was more than 25 million yen each year. Watanabe said he was Chairman in name only and had little to do with choosing the new chairman. Then, Watanabe suddenly quit the IIBC. The son of his girlfriend was in charge of the non-profit company. The IIBC paid Watanabe 25 million yen for his retirement. The IIBC lowered the price of the TOEIC Secure Program Test from 6,615 yen to 5,985 yen from September 13, 2009. Ministry of Trade asked the IIBC to lower the price because the test was making too much money. IIBC has a for-profit partner company called International Communications School (ICS). In July 2010, the Tokyo Tax Bureau announced that ICS lied about 100 million yen in income. ICS had to pay 30 million yen in taxes and fines. ==TOEIC in the Republic of Korea== South Korea is the second largest user of TOEIC by population. But, some major corporations have stopped using TOEIC scores for employment, or have required lower scores. From 2011, Korean universities were no longer allowed to use TOEIC and TOEFL scores as part of the selecting students. Seoul National University has developed another English proficiency test, TEPS. It may replace TOEIC. ==TOEIC in Europe== In France, some Grandes écoles require a TOEIC score of at least 785 for a diploma. Some people think this is wrong because it means a diploma from a state school depends on a private corporation. The Commission des titres d'ingénieur set the 785 score as similar to a B2+ level on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Student who cannot score 785 may have to show their English language ability in some other way. Some schools allow one more year after the end of studies to complete the diploma. In Greece, TOEIC is accepted by ASEP as part of hiring new government workers. TOEIC is used by some universities in Italy. All universities require that students pass an English examination before entering a degree courses or receiving diplomas. Students usually need a TOEIC score of 600 to earn a diploma. Many universities allow other tests such as the Cambridge certificate and TOEFL. ==TOEIC Bridge== TOEIC Bridge is a simpler version of the TOEIC test. This test is for beginning and intermediate speakers. It has 100 multiple-choice questions. The test lasts about one hour. ==Related pages== * CASEC * IELTS, International English Language Testing System * TOEFL ==References== *FRIDAY (May 29, 2009) 【TOEIC】 《渡辺弥栄司氏・92歳》高齢会長と親密女性《顧問》「私物化経営」の実態. *FRIDAY (June 5, 2009) TOEIC会長《渡辺弥栄司氏・92歳》「《親密》女性《顧問》の団体に予算計上の“私物化”」. *McCrostie, James, \"TOEIC no turkey at 30\", Japan Times, August 11, 2009. *McCrostie, James, \"TOEIC: Where does the money go?\", Japan Times, August 18, 2009. ==Other websites== * ETS - Educational Testing Service Category:Tests Category:English language Category:Language education",
