 "text": "The fighting game series Super Smash Bros. from Nintendo was started in 1999. It features many video game characters from different series. There are over 80 playable characters across the series. Most of these are from series owned by Nintendo, but there are also some characters from series owned by other companies. There are also other non-player characters, such as enemies, bosses, and power-ups. == Playable characters == Each game in the series has a number of playable characters called \"fighters\". There are currently 86 fighters in the entire series. Starting with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, characters from non-Nintendo series started being added. At the start of each game, some of the fighters will be hidden. To unlock a hidden fighter, players need to reach certain goals and then defeat that fighter in a match. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, players can make their own Mii Fighters. Mii Fighters have costumes which can be unlocked or bought as downloadable content. Many of these costumes are based on characters and series which do not have playable characters, such as Heihachi Mishima from Tekken, Sans from Undertale, Cuphead from Cuphead, Vault Boy from Fallout and Travis Touchdown from No More Heroes. All games have fighters that share a lot of moves and properties with other characters, but with some small differences. In Ultimate, these characters are called \"Echo Fighters\". In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, some characters were released as downloadable content (DLC). This means that players have to buy them separately from the game itself.
