 "text": "The Battle of Aqaba was a major battle during World War I. It was fought on July 6, 1917 between the Ottoman Empire and Arab Revolt, who part of the Central Powers and Allied Powers in the same order. The city of Aqaba, Jordan was an important coastal city and port controlled by the Ottomans. Even though the city was heavily defended on the coast, there was little defense inland. This was because the Ottomans thought the Arabian Desert outside the city was impossible to cross. Led by Arab chief Auda Abu Tayi and British officer T. E. Laurence, the Arab Revolt marched across the Arabian Desert to Aqaba. This surprised the Ottomans and the Arab Revolt captured the city. Category:World War I",
