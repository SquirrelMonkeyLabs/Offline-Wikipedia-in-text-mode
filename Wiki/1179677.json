 "text": "Since the European migrant crisis happened in 2015, the White genocide conspiracy theory has become popular among Neo-Nazis and White nationalists. Under the theory, Jews are accused of encouraging non-white immigration to change the ethnic composition of White-majority countries. This conspiracy theory is often spread along with other antisemitic tropes, especially ideas from the well-known forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, to make it sound real to those who are already antisemitic. ==Causes== Many believers of this theory reportedly have an extinction anxiety about the majority White population possibly becoming the minority in their own country. Ethnic minorities in their countries are sometimes considered \"foreign\" and \"incompatible with the mainstream\". ==Examples== In the United States (US), Elon Musk, Twitter's current owner, has been accused of agreeing with the theory. There were also several terrorist attacks committed by those who believed in this theory, the most recent of which was the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, where 11 were killed and 7 injured. ==Related pages== * Khazar myth * Holocaust denial * Irish slaves myth * Holodomor denial * Anti- Judaism and antisemitism ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Racism Category:21st century Category:Antisemitism Category:Discrimination Category:Conspiracy theories Category:21st century in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:21st century in Germany Category:Antisemitism in Germany Category:21st century in the United States",
