 "text": "Hyloxalus craspedoceps is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog can be as big as 19.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be as big as 20.5 mm long. This frog has disks on the toes of all four feet for climbing. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. The sides of the body are light brown in color with darker brown spots. The sides of the head are brown and yellow in color. The tops of the front legs are yellow in color. The belly is yellow-white in color with some green color. The bottoms of the legs are yellow in color. The adult male frog's chest and throat are brown in color. The male frog's male organs are white in color. The iris of the eye is copper-brown in color with a dark brown mark. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in exactly one place, 500 meters above sea level in the Cordillera Central. Scientists saw this frog in a rainforest that had been cut down. ==Young== Scientists believe the female frog lays her eggs on the ground, but they have not seen female Hyloxalus craspedoceps frogs laying eggs. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. Scientists saw one male frog with seven tadpoles on his back at the same time. Scientists saw tadpoles swimming in a stream. The tadpoles are dark brown in color with cream-white bellies. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. Because scientists saw the frogs in a rainforest that people had cut down, they think this frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
