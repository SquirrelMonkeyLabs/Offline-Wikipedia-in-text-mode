 "text": "Kuldeep Yadav, born on December 14, 1994, is an Indian cricketer known for his chinaman bowler spin bowling. Kuldeep represents India and plays for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket. In the Indian Premier League, he's part of the Delhi Capitals team. He's currently ranked as No. 10th in the ODI, 30th in T20I and 51th in Test by ICC as of September 2023. His cricket journey includes playing for the Indian Under-19 cricket team and participating in the 2014 U-19 Cricket World Cup. A remarkable achievement came on December 18, 2019, when he became the first Indian bowler to record two hat-tricks in international cricket during a match against the West Indies. ==Domestic Career== When Kuldeep Yadav first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, he was inspired by Wasim Akram and Zaheer Khan and thus he began as a fast bowler. However, his coach Kapil Pandey suggested something unusual - switching to left-arm wristspin. This change wasn't easy, and Kuldeep even considered going back to fast bowling. But he soon realized that left-arm wristspin suited him better. He not only had good control over his deliveries but also mastered a tricky wrong'un. In India, there haven't been many bowlers like him, so Kuldeep gained attention quickly, especially after performing well at the Under-19 level. He was eventually selected for 2014 U-19 Cricket World Cup. Kuldeep Yadav made a significant mark in the World Cup. He became India's top wicket-taker in the tournament and also achieved the rare feat of taking a hat-trick, a first for any Indian bowler in the history of this competition. This outstanding performance turned heads and caught the attention of cricket selectors, making it a pivotal (extremely important) moment for young Indian talent. ==References== ==Other websites== *Kuldeep Yadav from ESPNcricinfo *Kuldeep Yadav from Cricbuzz Category:1994 births Category:Indian cricketers Category:Living people",
