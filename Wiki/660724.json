 "text": "Donna Theo Strickland (born May 27, 1959) is a Canadian physicist. She was born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. She worked in the field of lasers. In 2018, she shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with GÃ©rard Mourou, as they both developed chirped pulse amplification. This is useful in laser micromachining, laser surgery, medicine, and in science. She is an associate professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Waterloo. She is the third woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. Wikipedia did not publish a draft article about her until after she won this prize. This was one famous example of how Wikipedia has been unfair to women scientists. ==Related pages== Gender bias on Wikipedia Women in Red ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian physicists Category:People from Guelph Category:Canadian Nobel Prize winners Category:Academics of the University of Waterloo",
