 "text": "A gentlemen's agreement is an agreement made between two or more people. It can be written down, spoken, or just understood. A gentlemen's agreement needs people to be honourable and stick to the agreement, instead of enforcing the agreement. Because of this, it is different from a legal agreement or contract, because a legal agreement or contract can be enforced if needed. Category:Ethics",
