The rice is then boiled over low heat until all the water is absorbed. Jeera rice is usually garnished with chopped fresh coriander leaves, but in some Indian hotels and restaurants it is also garnished with round chopped onion. It can be eaten without another item or served with raita, curry. In Indian cuisine, it tastes best with rajma curry, chhole, mutton curry as well as pulses of different cooking styles. == History == The cooking method of Jeera rice is not found in very ancient books or writings of Indian cuisine. Writings about this cuisine have been found in books and travelogues of the ancient Mughal Empire. The Mughals preferred rice dishes, and so the chefs invented new recipes for rice and experimented with traditional old recipes. This is how Jeera rice was invented. Later, it was adopted in Indian cuisine and became so popular that the cuisine has now become very common. == References == == Other websites == * Jeera Rice Recipe * Jeera Rice Recipe Video Category:Indian food Category:Pakistani food",
