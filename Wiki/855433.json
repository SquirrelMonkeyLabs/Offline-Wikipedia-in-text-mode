 "text": "The Polka-Dot Man (Abner Krill) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is a minor enemy of Batman. His powers include advanced technology in the form of the costume's polka dots, which were controlled through the costume's belt. == Fictional character biography == Abner Krill and his siblings were exposed to a deadly interdimensional virus in an attempt to turn them into superheroes. As a result, he manifested a disease that causes him to grow multicolored pustules on his body over time, which he has to expel at least twice a day and can use as destructive projectiles. == Powers and abilities == The Polka-Dot Man's powers come from his costume, which is equipped with various devices that can create and control small projectiles (like darts, bullets, or even tiny robots), project energy blasts from his eyes, generate force fields, create smoke screens or other distractions, and fly using a jetpack-like device. == In other media == The Polka-Dot Man made his movie debut in James Gunn's DC Extended Universe movie The Suicide Squad in 2021, played by David Dastmalchian. ==References== Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1962 Category:Batman characters Category:DC Comics supervillains",
