 "text": "Racing Rules of Sailing (often called RRS) are rules for sailing races. They are used in many kinds of races, such as yacht racing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, model boats, and dinghy racing. These rules are for races with more than one boat using wind power. World Sailing, the group that manages sailing worldwide, updates the rules every four years after the Olympic Games. == Main rules == There are 15 main rules about how boats must act when they meet on the water. === Four main rules === # A boat on port tack must stay out of the way of a boat on starboard tack. # If boats are next to each other on the same tack, the boat closer to the wind must stay clear. # If boats are on the same tack but not side by side, the boat behind must stay clear. # A boat that is turning (tacking) must stay out of the way of boats not turning. === Extra limits === # Even if you have the right of way, you must try to avoid a crash. # If you gain right of way, you must give the other boat time to move. # If you change direction, you must let the other boat keep clear. # If you are passing to leeward, you must not sail higher than your proper course. === Other rules === There are also rules about marks and obstacles, starting mistakes, taking penalties, sailing backwards, and capsizing. == References ==",
