In 1888, Ford was elected District Attorney of Sierra County as a Republican. He re-elected in 1890 without opposition, as the Democrats did not nominate a candidate against him. Ford became the Republican California State Senator in 1892 and 1895, representing the 3rd Senate District, covering Plumas, Sierra, and Nevada Counties. On March 23, 1893, he introduced two bills known as the Ford's Mining Bills, Senate Bill No. 50 aimed to allow hydraulic mining where it would not harm navigable rivers, and Senate Bill No. 389 proposed $250,000 for building restraining dams, funded by the U.S. government.
