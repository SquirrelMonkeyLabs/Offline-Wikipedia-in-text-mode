 "text": "The resplendent bush frog or Eravikulam bush frog (Roarchestes resplendens) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in about five places, between 1896 to 2695 meters above sea level in the grasslands of the Western Ghat mountains. The adult male frog is 22.7 - 24.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the two adult female frogs that scientists found were 25.2 and 28.3 mm long. The frog's skin is red, bright yellow, bright orange, and black-brown. The iris of the eye is bright red. Scientists named this frog \"resplendens\" because of its bright colors. This frog has short legs and very large glands. These frogs hide during the day and move at night. They hide from flashlights and other lights that humans use at night, so they are hard to see. This frog is not a tree frog. It lives on the ground. People see it on rocks covered in moss. The female frog lays eggs near bamboo plants or under moss. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They never swim as tadpoles. This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Eravikulam National Park, and Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Scientists think climate change could harm this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
