 "text": "Marcel \"Marco\" van Basten (; born 31 October 1964) is a former Dutch footballer. He was most recently the manager of the Netherlands national football team. He had to quit playing football early because of an injury that kept him from playing for more than a year. Van Basten was known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular strikes and volleys. He is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. == Awards == Van Basten was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1992 and won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1988, 1989 and 1992. He was named \"UEFA best Player of the Year\" three times (1989, 1990 and 1992) and \"FIFA World Player of the Year\" in 1992.
