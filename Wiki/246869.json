 "text": "Viktor Orbán (31 May 1963) is a Hungarian politician who has served as the Prime Minister of Hungary for three non-consecutive terms since 1998. He is the founder and leader of the ruling right-wing party, Fidesz. Orbán was born on May 31, 1963, in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. He studied law at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest and became involved in politics in the 1980s, when he helped found Fidesz, a youth organization that later evolved into a political party. Orbán first served as Prime Minister from 1998 to 2002, during which time he implemented a series of economic and social reforms that helped to stabilize Hungary's economy and modernize its infrastructure. He was reelected in 2010 and has since been reelected twice, in 2014 and 2018. As Prime Minister, Orbán has pursued a populist, nationalist agenda that has been controversial both domestically and internationally. He has been criticized for his crackdown on civil society, media freedom, and academic independence, as well as his handling of the refugee crisis and his opposition to the European Union. Orbán's government has been accused of corruption and of using its power to undermine democratic institutions and the rule of law. His efforts to centralize power and weaken the judiciary and the media have drawn criticism from the European Union and human rights organizations. Despite these criticisms, Orbán remains popular among his supporters, who credit him with improving Hungary's economy and promoting its national interests. He has been successful in mobilizing a loyal base of supporters and has built a reputation as a strong, decisive leader. Orbán's vision for Hungary is based on what he has described as \"illiberal democracy,\" a model of governance that emphasizes national sovereignty, traditional values, and economic self- sufficiency. He has argued that this model is better suited to the challenges of the 21st century than traditional liberal democracy, which he sees as outdated and unsustainable. Orbán's legacy as a leader is a matter of debate. While he has been credited with bringing stability and prosperity to Hungary, his authoritarian tendencies and controversial policies have raised concerns about the future of democracy and human rights in the country. == Early life == Viktor Orbán is a Hungarian politician who has been the country's Prime Minister since 2010. He was born on May 31, 1963, in Székesfehérvár, Hungary, and grew up in a middle-class family. Orbán showed an early interest in politics and was a member of various student organizations during his high school years. He went on to study law at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, where he became involved in anti-communist activism and co-founded the Federation of Young Democrats, a liberal youth organization. After graduation, Orbán began his political career and was first elected to parliament in 1990, following the fall of communism in Hungary. == Early career == Viktor Orbán's early political career was defined by his role in the Hungarian democratic opposition and his leadership of the Federation of Young Democrats. In 1988, he was a key figure in organizing a demonstration in Budapest that called for free elections and greater political freedoms.

However, his administration was criticized for its lack of transparency, and Orbán faced accusations of nepotism and corruption. Orbán also pursued a controversial media policy, introducing laws that restricted press freedom and gave the government more control over public media. His administration was also marked by tensions with neighboring countries, particularly Slovakia and Romania, over issues related to Hungarian minority rights. In the 2002 election, Orbán's party was defeated by the Hungarian Socialist Party, and he subsequently went into opposition. == Leader of the Opposition == Following his defeat in the 2002 election, Viktor Orbán became the leader of the opposition in the Hungarian parliament. During this period, he worked to reshape his party's image and ideology, moving it away from its previous liberal stance and towards a more conservative, nationalist platform. Orbán also focused on building a stronger party organization and cultivating ties with conservative and populist movements in Europe and the United States. His opposition to the Hungarian Socialist Party government and its austerity measures helped him to regain popularity with voters, and his party won a decisive victory in the 2010 election, returning him to the position of Prime Minister.

His government implemented a new constitution, which was widely criticized for limiting the power of the judiciary, undermining the independence of the media, and restricting the rights of minorities.
