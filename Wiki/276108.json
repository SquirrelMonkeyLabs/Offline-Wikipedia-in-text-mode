 "text": "Arsenic trisulfide, also known as orpiment or arsenic(III) sulfide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is As2S3. It has arsenic and sulfide ions in it. The arsenic is in its +3 oxidation state. ==Properties== Arsenic trisulfide is a yellow solid. It is a semiconductor. It has a glass (amorphous) form and a crystalline form. It burns in air to make sulfur dioxide and arsenic trioxide, which makes a highly toxic smoke. Arsenic trisulfide can oxidize on the surface to make a highly toxic layer of arsenic trioxide as well. Arsenic trisulfide is not toxic unless it oxidizes. It does not react with acids. ==Occurrence== Arsenic trisulfide is found as the mineral orpiment. ==Preparation== Arsenic trisulfide is made when an arsenic compound like arsenic trichloride reacts with hydrogen sulfide. It is also made when arsenic and sulfur are heated together. ==Uses== It was looked at for treating cancer. It was used by the Egyptians as a pigment and cosmetic. It is used in glass. ==References== ==Related pages== *Arsenic tribromide *Antimony sulfide *Bismuth trisulfide Category:Arsenic compounds Category:Sulfur compounds",
