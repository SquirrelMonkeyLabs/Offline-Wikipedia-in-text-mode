 "text": "right|200px Small-cell carcinoma (also known as \"small-cell lung cancer\", or \"oat-cell carcinoma\") is a type of highly malignant cancer that most commonly arises within the lung, although it can occasionally arise in other body sites, such as the cervix, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. Small cell carcinoma has a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, and earlier development of metastases compared to a non-small cell carcinoma. ==References== Category:Cancer",
