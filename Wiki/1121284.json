 "text": "Anthemius of Novgorod (also known as Onfim of Novgorod, or simply also known as Onfim, Onfime, Onphim, Onphime, Onfem, Onfeme, Onphem, Onpheme; born around the 13th century) was a Novgorodian boy. He is known for writing down his letters, studies, homework, and drawings on pieces of birch bark. He wrote in the Old Novgorod dialect. Because of his child-like writings and drawings, it was estimated that Anthemius was between the ages of six and ten. He was probably around six or seven. Most of the birch bark containing his homework, studies, and drawings was discovered about 740 to 780 years later, in the city of Veliky Novgorod, on 13-14 July 1956. ==Other websites== Category:13th- century artists Category:Children",
