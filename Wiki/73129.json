 "text": "Super Smash Bros. Brawl (commonly known as SSBB or Brawl) is the third video game in the Super Smash Bros. series. It was made by Sora and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. == Gameplay == ===Characters=== There are 39 characters in Brawl. 25 characters are unlocked at the start, and 14 characters are hidden and have to be unlocked by the player. Most of the characters from the second game in the series, Super Smash Bros. Melee, are also in Brawl. Some characters from Melee (Mewtwo, Roy, Dr. Mario, Pichu, and Young Link) are not in Brawl. Two new characters (Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog) were in games that Nintendo did not own. The game is best known for the tripping mechanic (fighters will trip at random when running), introducing third-party characters, and the Smash Ball ===Items=== Like the other Super Smash Bros. games, items appear in the middle of the game that characters can use. However, Brawl adds many more items, such as the \"Assist Trophy\" (where a character appears to help players defeat opponents) and the \"Smash Ball\", an item that lets players use a powerful attack called a \"Final Smash\". ==References== ==Other websites== *Super Smash Bros.
