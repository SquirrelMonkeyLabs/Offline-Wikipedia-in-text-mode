 "text": "Will Wood is an American musician from New Jersey. When in a studio or performing live with a band, he is usually accompanied by \"the Tapeworms\", which includes Mike Bottiglieri on guitar, Matt Berger on saxophone, Mario Conte on drums, and Vater Boris on bass. Before forming \"Will Wood and the Tapeworms\", he was performing with other bands, such as Jamface, Strange Thick, A Verbal Equinox and The Stereosexuals. He also performs by himself. His live shows include a mix of music, talking, and comedy. == Style == Wood's style of piano often changes from one song to the next, drawing from folk, pop, jazz, rock and roll, latin music, and Klezmer, which is the traditional music of the Ashkenazi Jews of Central and Eastern Europe. == Body of Work == Wood has released 7 albums since 2015, Everything is a Lot (2015), Self-Ish (2016), The Normal Album (2020) \"In case I make it,\" (2022), 2 live albums, The Real Will Wood (2020) and IN CASE I DIE (2023), and a remix album The New Normal (Normal Album 2024 Edit) (2024). He has also written music for the podcast, Camp Here and There. He also directed the \"The Real Will Wood\", a part mockumentary, part documentary film promoting his live tour, as well as the documentary following the stages of production for \"The Normal Album\", called \"What Did I Do? (The Making of the Normal Album)\" Will also takes part in a comedy podcast called \"Life in the World to Come\" with Chris Dunne. == Personal life == Will doesn't like to share details of his personal life and avoids social media. During old live shows and interviews, he would play a distasteful and high energy character and often lie about his personal life, including about having a daughter named Millie after Eleven from Stranger Things. Will is very open with past struggles with drug addiction and mental illness. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder early in his career and donates large amounts of live show performances to mental health charities. == Discography == === Studio Albums === * Everything is a Lot (2015) Released as Will Wood and the Tapeworms * SELF-iSH (2016) * The Normal Album (2020) * \"In case I make it,\" (2022) === Live Albums === * The Real (2018)Re-released in 2020 as The Real Will Wood (Music from the Award-Winning Concert Film) * IN CASE I DIE: (Live) (2023) === Soundtrack Albums === * Camp Here and There (Original Series Soundtrack) (2021) * Camp Here and There SoundtrackÀê Campfire Songs Edition (2022) === Remix Album === * The New Normal!
