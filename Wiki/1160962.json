 "text": "Shivaji's invasion of Konkan was an invasion led by the Maratha king Shivaji in the Konkan region of India. The campaign began when Raghunathpant went to Rajpuri on 31 July 1657. The Sabhasad Chronicle provides a brief account of a campaign led by Raghunath Ballal Sabnis against the Siddi. It mentions that, following Shivaji’s orders, he marched with five or six thousand infantry, captured the area up to Danda-Rajpuri, including the forts of Tala and Ghosala, defeated the Siddi’s forces in a few battles, and eventually made peace with the Siddi through a treaty. Shivaji left Rajgad on 3rd October 1657, passed through the Telbaila Pass, captured Chaul, and moved towards Mahuli. His troops seized Kalyan on 24 October 1657, likely halting there as it lies between Chaul and Mahuli. Shivaji started his North Konkan campaign at the right time and stopped the Mughals from taking over the region. When Shivaji reached Kalyan, it seems there was a misunderstanding that his 200 horsemen had come to help Habash Khan. In reality, they were there to capture Kalyan from him, not to assist him. The skirmish with Shivaji’s men mentioned, likely took place a few days before its date, around 10th October 1657. Shortly after, on 24th October 1657, Shivaji’s troops captured Kalyan- Bhiwandi. The fort of Asheri, located about 50 km north of Bhiwandi, was under Portuguese control at the time. There were several skirmishes between the Portuguese and Shivaji during this campaign. After taking control of the forts in North Konkan, Shivaji likely had to repair, equip, and garrison them to make them ready for battle. This effort drew the attention and response of the Mughal officials in the region. == Background == Shivaji focused on strengthening his father's jagir without provoking the Mughals. Around 1657, as his ambitions grew, he first drew Aurangzeb's attention. After settling issues with the Morays of Javli, Shivaji raided Mughal territories, sacking Junnar and Ahmednagar, while also capturing Kalyan and Bhivandi from the Adil Shahis. The Bijapur court was distracted by the Mughal invasion following Muhammad Adil Shah’s death. Shivaji saw the rich trade region between Junnar and Kalyan as a valuable addition to his jagir, easily defendable from Pune. == Invasion == === Campaign against the Siddi of Janjira === Shivaji had entered the Konkan after capturing Jawali, which led to a clash with the Siddi of Janjira. The Shivapur Chronology says that Raghunathpant went to Rajpuri on 31 July 1657, but it doesn’t explain why. The Sabhasad Chronicle provides a brief account of a campaign led by Raghunath Ballal Sabnis against the Siddi. It says that, by Shivaji’s order, he led five or six thousand infantry, captured the area up to Danda-Rajpuri, including the forts of Tala and Ghosala, defeated the Siddi’s forces in a few battles, and, after the Siddi sought peace, made a treaty with him. The Raghunathpant mentioned in the Shivapur Chronology may refer to this Raghunath Ballal Sabnis. The Shivabharat confirms that Shivaji had captured some territory from the Siddi before Afzal Khan’s campaign against him began, around June 1659. It mentions that Afzal Khan, after arriving in Wai, wrote a letter to Shivaji. The letter lists Shivaji’s many past crimes and demands that he surrender all the forts and territories he had captured. === Incursion into the North Konkan === Shivaji left Rajgad on 3rd October 1657, travelled through the Telbaila Pass, entered the Konkan, captured Chaul, and then moved towards Mahuli. Kalyan was captured by Shivaji’s troops on 24 October 1657. Located 80 km north of Chaul and 40 km south of Mahuli, it is likely that Shivaji passed through and possibly halted at Kalyan on his way from Chaul to Mahuli. Shivaji’s capture of Chaul is also confirmed by a Portuguese document dated 28 November 1657. Shivaji planned for one group to quickly seize the treasure near Purandar while another group attacked Kalyan at the same time. The plan worked perfectly, and the treasure was safely taken to Rajgad. During this, Shivaji’s Peshwa, Shyamraj Nilakanth, and his cousin, Dadaji Bapuji, surprised Kalyan, which had no defense because the Governor was not there. Another group of skilled Mavalas, led by Sakho Krishna Lohokare, attacked the nearby post of Bhivandi at the same time. Shivaji placed strong garrisons in both Kalyan and Bhivandi to prepare for any counterattacks from Bijapur. In just a year, Shivaji’s territory doubled in size and became much richer in resources. By the end of October 1657, the entire North Konkan region was under Shivaji’s control. === Invasion of South Konkan === With the capture of Kalyan, Shivaji gained control over a triangular region. The base of this triangle was the coastline from Bassein to Rajapur, with the two sides meeting at Indapur. He captured several forts in this area, including Prabalgad near Panvel, which was held by a Bijapuri officer named Kesari Singh, who was killed in the battle. Shivaji personally climbed the fort and found a hidden treasure, including large vessels filled with mohars, coins, and gold bars. During the search, Kesari Singh’s mother and two children were discovered hiding in fear. Shivaji approached the lady, bowed to her as if she were his own mother, provided her with a palanquin, and sent her safely to her home in Deulgaon with his escort. He also ensured that the bodies of Kesari Singh and others who died defending the fort were cremated with proper rites and honors. After securing North Konkan, Shivaji moved south through Chiplun to Rajapur and further to Sondha, personally inspecting the areas he passed. He studied their defensive and financial strengths. After completing his tour, he returned to Rajgad. This inspection likely led him to decide that the west coast would serve as the best base for his future operations. == Territories gained == Shivaji is believed to have captured around twenty-five to thirty forts in the North Konkan region, which had previously been part of the Nizamshahi Sultanate. These included forts like Mahuli, Lohagad, Tung, Tikona, Visapur, Songad, Karnala, Tala, and Ghosala. Most of the Nizamshahi Konkan, except for the Siddi’s possessions of Janjira and Danda-Rajpuri, came under Shivaji’s control. While the exact details of how he captured the other forts are unclear, many were likely abandoned or poorly defended, surrendering without much resistance. The quick capture of the important Mahuli fort in just five days shows how neglected these forts had become. == References == Category:Mughal Empire Category:Maratha Empire Category:17th century",
