 "text": "Woodward's Stores Ltd. was a Canadian chain of department stores that sold a variety of different products. They were headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company was first created by Charles A. Woodward in 1892, with the first store being opened on the corner of Main and Georgia Street in Vancouver. Woodward's then expanded into Alberta. They started to build a store in early 1926 in Edmonton and completed it on October 15. Woodward's stores were known for having a large section for groceries called the \"Food Floor\". On December 11, 1992, Woodward's declared for bankruptcy. Hudson's Bay Company purchased the Woodward's brand in June 1993 for $235 million. They then turned the Woodward's stores into both The Bay and Zellers. The 1903 Woodward's Building still stands in Vancouver. On September 30, 2006, everything except the oldest part of the building was demolished. It is now a combination of both residential and businesses. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1892 establishments in Canada Category:Companies based in Vancouver Category:Defunct companies of Canada Category:Department stores of Canada",
