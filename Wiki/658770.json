In 1982 Lozano entered the race for alderman of the 22nd Ward in the city's 1983 elections, in an attempt to be the first Mexican-American elected to the Chicago City Council. Lozano was known for bringing Latino voters across the city to support candidate Harold Washington, who became Chicago's first African-American mayor. On June 8, 1983, Lozano was shot to death by a local gang member in his home in Pilsen, Chicago, aged 32. Lozano's campaign manager in the 1983 election, Chuy Garc√≠a, went on to win a 1986 special election for the 22nd Ward. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Assassinated American politicians Category:Murders by firearm in the United States Category:American political activists Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:Politicians from Texas Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:People from Harlingen, Texas",
