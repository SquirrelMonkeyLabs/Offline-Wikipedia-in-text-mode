 "text": ":For another species commonly known as the masked tree frog, see Smilisca manisorum. The masked tree frog, New Granada cross-banded tree frog, Tarraco treefrog, or Central American smilisca (Smilisca phaeota) is a frog that lives in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia. Scientists have seen it as high in the hills as 3300 meters above sea level. This frog is called the masked tree frog because it has dark skin around its eyes so it looks like it is wearing a black mask. The black mask covers their eyes, which helps them hide from predators. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. The frog sleeps on top of large leaves, in ferns, or inside rolled-up leaves. Scientists think this frog eats insects and other animals without spines. This frog can change color. It can be tan during the day and turn green at night. The male frog sits next to a small pool of rainwater and sings \"wrauk\" for the females. The females lay 2000 eggs at a time, which float on the surface of the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly before the rainwater dries up. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
