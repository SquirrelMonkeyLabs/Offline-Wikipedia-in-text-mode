His monumental (usually bronze) sculptures adorn many public places in Brussels as well as in Germany, Israel, Italy, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United States. Strebelle was a knwon artist for more than 65 years, and his works are found in private collections and public settings around the world. His style has evolved from robust, organic abstract forms to the sinuous lines seen in Athletes' Alley, on the site of the Beijing Olympic Games. His sculpture \"The Abduction of Europa\" () has been on display in the Square of Europe, Moscow since September 2002. Strebelle died on 29 July 2017 in Brussels at the age of 90.Le sculpteur belge Olivier Strebelle est décédé à l'âge de 90 ans ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website * Athletes Alley (Official website) Category:1927 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Belgian sculptors Category:People from Brussels",
