 "text": "Suri Jagek, meaning 'observing the sun', is the traditional Kalasha meteorological and astronomical knowledge system and practice. It's used in the Hindu Kush mountains of northwestern Pakistan to observe the sun, moon, stars, and shadows in relation to local terrain. This system helps the Kalasha people predict when to sow seeds, take care of animals, and anticipate natural disasters. It also guides their calendar, determining dates for social events, festivals, and religious ceremonies. Suri Jagek and the Kalasha culture has been declared an Intangible cultural heritage of Pakistan by UNESCO since 2018. Suri Jagek reflects how the Kalasha people connect with their environment for a sustainable lifestyle. The knowledge is passed through stories, songs, and proverbs, adapting some aspects for modern life. Despite its visibility, younger generations may not fully appreciate its cultural importance due to the growing preference for digital weather predictions. == Observatories == The observatories where the practice of Surik Jagek is observed is called Suri Jagaekein in Kalasha language. At first, people thought it was more for one gender, as women being Pragata (Impure) could not visit the observatories, from where the rising and setting sun were observed. But later, they realized that Surik Jagek is about knowing not just the sun but also other celestial bodies. Women are seen as experts in observing the moon and stars. The Kalasha calendar is also based on this practice of Suri Jagek. == Related pages == *Intangible cultural heritage *Kalasha religion *Religions of Pakistan == References == Category:Kalash people Category:Pakistani culture",
