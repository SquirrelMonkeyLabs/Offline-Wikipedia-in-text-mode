 "text": "The Government of Canada is a constitutional monarchy. It has a monarch, who currently is King Charles III. He appoints a Governor General to Canada to represent himself. The country is run by a democratically elected government, led by a Prime Minister. A Parliament is elected, usually every five years. From the parliament, a cabinet is organized with the prime minister as leader. The prime minister (currently Justin Trudeau) is the head of government, who is invited by the Crown to form a government after securing the confidence of the House of Commons, which is typically determined through the election of enough members of a single political party in a federal election to provide a majority of seats in Parliament, forming a governing party.",
