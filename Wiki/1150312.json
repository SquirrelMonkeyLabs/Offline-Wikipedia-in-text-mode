 "text": "The Bolivian poison frog or Bolivian poison-arrow frog (Ameerega boliviana) is a frog. It lives in Bolivia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests near streams in Yungas. People have also seen it in grassy places where animals eat grass. Scientists saw the frog between 800 and 1400 meters above sea level. This frog can live in places that people have changed so long as there is enough water in the air. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Pil√≥n Lajas Biosphere Reserve, Area Natural de Manejo Integado Nacional Apolobamba, and Area Protegida Municipal Cabeceras de Maniqui. ==Young== The male frog sits near the edge of the forest and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water, for example streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Humans change the places where the frog lives. People cut down forests to get wood to build with, build roads, and make farms and places for cows to eat grass. There are also more landslides than there used to be. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog by making less rain in its home. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
