 "text": "Barisan Nasional is a big group of political coalition in Malaysia that was founded in 1973. It includes various political parties and leaders, with different leaders like Mahathir Mohamad at times. The coalition aims to develop Malaysia's economy and ensure stability, contributing to the country's rapid growth and modernization efforts. However, Barisan Nasional faced problems during Najib Razak's time as Prime Minister from 2009 to 2018. His leadership was overshadowed by the 1MDB scandal, where it was said that billions of dollars from a government investment fund were used improperly. This scandal made people worry about corruption and honesty in Malaysian politics. In the 2018 Malaysian general election, Barisan Nasional lost largely because people were unhappy about the 1MDB scandal and economic problems. This election changed Malaysia's government and led to Najib Razak facing legal issues because of the scandal. ==References== Category:Politics of Malaysia",
