 "text": "The Nashville Xpress were a Minor League Baseball team from Nashville, Tennessee, that played from 1993 to 1994. They played baseball at the Double-A (AA) level, the second-most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB), against other baseball teams in the Southern League. Their home stadium was called Herschel Greer Stadium. The Xpress were partnered with the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball. The team was named \"Xpress\" for the trains which ran along railway tracks beyond the ballpark's outfield wall. The Xpress began playing baseball in 1993. This happened after Charlotte, North Carolina, got a Triple-A team in 1993, leaving its Double-A Charlotte Knights without a home. Nashville Sounds president Larry Schmittou let them use Greer as a temporary ballpark. To make it work, the Xpress' home games were scheduled for when the Sounds were playing at their opponents' stadiums. The team left Nashville to play temporarily in Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1995 and 1996. There, the team was called the Port City Roosters. The team got a permanent home in Mobile, Alabama, as the Mobile BayBears in 1997. The team stayed in Mobile through the 2019 season after which they moved to Madison, Alabama, a suburb of Huntsville, where they became known as the Rocket City Trash Pandas. ==References== ==Other websites== *1993 Nashville Xpress statistics at Baseball-Reference *1994 Nashville Xpress statistics at Baseball-Reference Category:1990s establishments in Tennessee Category:Baseball teams in the United States",
