 "text": "In video games, a boss is a powerful enemy much more potent than other normal enemies in the game. Usually, a boss is unique, meaning there is only one, but sometimes it must be fought more than once. Bosses are often found at the end of a level or the game. Bosses also tend to have more health than the protagonist. Category:Video game terminology",
