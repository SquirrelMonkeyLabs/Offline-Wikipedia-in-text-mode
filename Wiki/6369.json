 "text": "When people say \"the world\" they usually mean Earth, especially in a cultural and geopolitical sense. Humans and all other known living things live in this world. Sometimes \"world\" means another planet. Before people discovered that Earth is a planet, they often used \"World\" to mean \"Universe\". They still sometimes use it to mean all humans or all civilization. Sometimes they mean a small part of Earth such as Western world, Islamic world, third world, new world or ancient world. == Related pages == * Universe Category:Geography",
