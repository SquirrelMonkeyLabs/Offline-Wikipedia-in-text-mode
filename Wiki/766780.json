 "text": "Beck's tree frog (Ranoidea becki) is a large tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Adult frogs are about 3.4 to 4.4 cm long. They are dark green or dark brown in color with darker spots and stripes. When dead frogs are saved for study, they have a white spot on their lip, but living frogs do not have this spot. These frogs live high in the mountains and people have found them 3200 meters above sea level. They live in or near bogs in grassy places. They lay eggs underneath rocks. Scientists do not know what the tadpoles look like. As of the 2010s, scientists had only found this frog in five places. They were places where human beings do not often go, so human activity does not bother these frogs. They are dying because a sickness that affects frogs and other amphibians, chytridiomycosis, has spread to their mountains. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
