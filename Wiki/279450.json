 "text": "Princess of Wales () is a royal title used in the United Kingdom. It is held by the wife of the Prince of Wales. It has been used since the first English Prince of Wales, in 1283. The current Princess of Wales is Catherine, the wife of William, Prince of Wales. There have been only ten Princesses of Wales, even though there have been a lot more than ten male heirs to the throne. The majority of Princes of Wales married after acceding to the throne as King. A number of other Princes of Wales died too young to marry. Until 2022, the second wife of the past Prince of Wales, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, was the Princess of Wales, but did not use the title, out of respect for her husband's first wife, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The princess is usually entitled to the style of Her Highness. ==References== *Princesses of Wales by Deborah Fisher.
