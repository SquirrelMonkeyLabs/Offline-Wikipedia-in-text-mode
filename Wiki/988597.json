 "text": "Delayed identification is a writing technique used in poetry and prose. It happens when actions are described before we are told who is doing them. We read about things that are being done, and only find out who or what is doing them in the next line or even several lines later. It is one way to build suspense in the writing. The reader or listener must be patient if they want to find out who or what is performing this action. This is a very old technique. It can be found in Biblical writing and in texts from the ancient Near East. ==References== Category:Writing",
