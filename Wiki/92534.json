 "text": "Oder-Spree is a Kreis (district) in the eastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district is named after the two major rivers in the district - the Spree, and the Oder river which is the eastern border. ==History== The district was created in 1993 by joining the districts of Eisenhüttenstadt, Beeskow and Fürstenwalde, and the independent city Eisenhüttenstadt. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows symbols for the three old districts which make up the district. In the topleft quarter is the coat of arms of the Bishops of Lebus, who had their seat in Fürstenwalde. The second quarter shows the chequered bar of the Cistercian Order as the symbol of the Abbey of Neuzelle. Until 1817 the abbey owned most of the territory which later became the district of Eisenhüttenstadt. The two quarters in the bottom symbolize the former district Beeskow. The three knives in the left are the symbol of the Lords of Strehla, the deer antler the symbol of the Lords of Biberstein, who in 1317 took over from the Lords of Strehla as the owners of Beeskow and Storkow. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter #Beeskow #Eisenhüttenstadt #Erkner #Friedland #Fürstenwalde #Storkow Amt-free municipalities #Grünheide #Rietz-Neuendorf #Schöneiche #Steinhöfel #Tauche #Woltersdorf 1\\.
