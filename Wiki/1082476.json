 "text": "Acanthopleurus is an extinct genus of prehistoric bony fish that lived during the early Oligocene epoch. It is a relative of the modern triplespines. It's from the Oligocene of Glarus, Switzerland. According to the fossils, Acanthopleurus may have looked long in appearance. The body was probably laterally compressed. However, very little is known about this prehistoric fish. == Species == * Acanthopleurus serratus Agassiz, 1843 * Acanthopleurus collettei Tyler, 1980 == References == # Sepkoski, Jack (2002). \"A compendium of fossil marine animal genera\".
