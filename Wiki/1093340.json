 "text": "The serrate-legged small tree frog or serrated frilled tree frog (Kurixalus odontotarsus) is a frog. It lives in China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. People have seen it between 250 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests and places where smaller woody plants grow. The tadpoles swim inditches or bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
