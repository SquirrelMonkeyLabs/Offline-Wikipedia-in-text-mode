 "text": "The 2022 Massachusetts gubernatorial election happened on November 8, 2022, to elect the governor of Massachusetts. The main two candidates were Maura Healey, of the Democratic Party, and Geoff Diehl, of the Republican Party. The then Governor, Charlie Baker did not run for a third term (even though he was allowed and not term limited), for reasons that remain unclear. Kim Driscoll and Leah Cole Allen were the running mates for Healey and Diehl respectively. Healey and Driscoll ended up winning the election by a sizable margin, and Healey became the first Democrat to be elected governor of Massachusetts since Deval Patrick in 2010, as well as the first female elected to be governor in Massachusetts. Diehl's campaign was marked by the endorsement of one man, Donald Trump. Trump made controversial statements about Diehl on the campaign trail, which was seen as many as the downfall of Diehl's campaign, and the Massachusetts Republican Party in general. With this victory, Healey secured a Democratic trifecta in government. ==References== Category:2022 elections in the United States Category:21st century in Massachusetts",
