 "text": "The Patton Brothers, comprising Jimmy Elliott (20 August 1931 â€“ 25 July 2019) and Brian Elliott (born 13 December 1933), were an English comedy double act and the two older brothers of Barry and Paul Elliott, the Chuckle Brothers. They began their career as a double act in 1954. Both Jimmy and Brian made appearances in the children's television series ChuckleVision, alongside their younger brothers Paul and Barry. Jimmy is known as No Slacking due to the catchphrase. For three months, all four brothers appeared together on the game show 3-2-1 with Ted Rogers on 17 April 1982 (Season 4, Episode 13), and also on New Faces. Afterwards, Jimmy and Brian returned to being the Patton Brothers. On 25 July 2019, Jimmy died of cancer at the age of 87. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1931 births Category:1933 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer Category:English comedians Category:Duos Category:English television personalities Category:People from Kent",
