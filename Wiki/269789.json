The Roman Catholic Church later made her a saint, and Lourdes has become one of the most visited places for pilgrims. ==References== Category:1844 births Category:1879 deaths Category:Christian saints Category:French Roman Catholics Category:Marian apparitions Category:People from Hautes-Pyrénées Category:Lourdes Category:19th-century French people",
