 "text": "The Hainan frilled tree frog or Hainan small tree frog (Kurixalus hainanus) is a frog. It lives in northeastern Vietnam and in parts of China: Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong and in the mountains on Hainan Island. People have seen it between 630 and 710 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests, bamboo forests, forests with many plants, and places with smaller plants. This frog's tadpoles swim in ponds that are not deep. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build small farms. People also catch this frog to eat and to make medicine. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
