 "text": "Peter Connelly (1 March 2006 – 3 August 2007) (also known as \"Baby P\", \"Child A\" and \"Baby Peter\") was a 17-month-old British child. He died of child abuse on 3 August 2007 in London, England after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period. His mother, her partner and his brother were sent to prison for attacking him. The case resulted in several big investigations into how the social services department of Haringey Council carried out its job looking after children in danger. In a similar case, the same child welfare authorities had failed seven years earlier in the murder of Victoria Climbié. There had been a public inquiry and measures had been put in place to prevent similar cases. ==References== Category:2007 crimes Category:2007 in the United Kingdom Category:2000s in London Category:August 2007 events Category:Crime in London Category:London Borough of Haringey Category:2000s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Children victims of violence",
