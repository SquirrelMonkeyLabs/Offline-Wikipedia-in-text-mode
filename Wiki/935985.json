The software is free, but only to Nintendo Switch Online members. Using elements of the battle royale genre, Tetris 99 has up to 99 players competing at the same time to complete rows with falling tetrominoes (blocks), which send attacks in the form of \"garbage rows\" to other players with the goal of knocking them out of the game. Arika would later develop similar games called Super Mario Bros. 35 and Pac-Man 99, which instead involve the games Super Mario Bros. and Pac-Man. ==Other websites== * * Tetris website ==References and notes== Category:Battle royale games Category:Nintendo Switch-only games Category:Puzzle video games",
