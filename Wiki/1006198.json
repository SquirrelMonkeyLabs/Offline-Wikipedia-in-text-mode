As prime minister, Tuka oversaw the implementation of anti-Semitic policies and the deportation of Slovak Jews to concentration camps. He was also involved in the persecution of political opponents and dissenters. After the war, Tuka was arrested and tried for war crimes and collaboration with the Nazis.
