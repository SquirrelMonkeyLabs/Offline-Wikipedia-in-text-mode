There were 25 men and 6 women. They won 1 gold medal, 2 silver medals and 1 bronze medal. == Goals == For the 2018 Winter Paralympics, Nord-Trøndelag County Council has some goals. These included getting more people to compete in disability sports. They also wanted to increase the level of accessibility to sports buildings and sports field in Nord-Trøndelag County and the rest of Norway. == Doping == In December 2017, Norway said it would not send any anti-doping officials to the Winter Olympics or Paralympics. They are tired of needing to use unpaid volunteers. They think anti-doping officials need to be paid. Anti-doping Norway chief executive Anders Solheim said, \"If you sell TV rights for this arrangement for billions of dollars, then we think it's wrong that we pay for Norwegian doping controllers to help with the controls. An inspector should receive a reasonable salary and his trip paid for the three weeks he or she will be there. By not paying doping controllers, the organisers are de facto relying on volunteers. Anti-doping work should not be a voluntary profession for those who want to. It is downplaying the priority of our work, and we are tired of it.\" == Para-Nordic skiing == === Skiers === Birgit Skarstein competes in two sports: adapted rowing and para-Nordic skiing. She won a gold medal at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in the PR1 W1x. Skarstein also went to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and she finished fourth.
