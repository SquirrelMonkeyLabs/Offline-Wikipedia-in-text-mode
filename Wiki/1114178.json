 "text": "Silverstoneia minima is a frog. It lives in Colombia, in Chocó and in Serranía del Baudó and around Alto del Buey. People can only go to those places in boats or aircraft. ==Home== This frog lives in forests near streams with rocks on the bottom. People have heard it calling in the middles of forests, far from water. People have seen this frog between 300 and 1070 meters above sea level. ==Name== Scientists named this frog minima because that is Latin for \"very small.\" This is the second smallest frog in Silverstoneia. Only Silverstoneia minutissimais smaller. ==Young== Scientists think the female frog lays eggs in dead leaves on the ground and that, after the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles streams. The scientists think this because that is what other frogs in Silverstoneia do. They have not seen Silverstoneia minima frogs lay eggs or move tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists are not sure whether this frog will die out soon because it is hard to visit the forest where the frog lives. People cut down the forest where the frog lives to get wood to build with. Now that there is less war near the frog's home, scientists think that people might start to catch the frog to sell as a pet. People have caught and sold other beautiful frogs from Chocó. This frog lives near a protected park, Parque Nacional Utría, but scientists don't know if it lives in the park. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
