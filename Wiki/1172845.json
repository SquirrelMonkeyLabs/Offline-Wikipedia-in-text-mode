 "text": "A tidal strait is a passage of water connecting 2 bodies of water where a tidal current flows. Mostly, tidal currents are usually unidirectional but sometimes are bidirectional. Although they are seaways, they are technically not rivers. Currents develop because of height differences on either side of the strait. Tidal straits are usually of tectonic origin and can allow sediments to pile in them.",
