He was known as a famous hangman, in addition, he owned a bar. One of his executions involved an acquaintance who visited his bar often; James Corbitt (20 October 1913 - 28 November 1950) nicknamed Tish by Pierrepoint. Pierrepoint said this about Corbitt's final moments. At twenty seconds to nine the next morning, he went into the death cell. He seemed under a great strain, but he did not see stark fear in his eyes, only a more childlike worry. He was anxious to be remembered and to be accepted. \"Hello, Tish,\" he said, not confidently. \"How are you?\" he was not effusive, just gave the casual warmth of his nightly greeting from behind the bar. == Birth == Albert was born in 1905 in Clayton, which was a civil parish of Bradford, his father Henry Pierrepoint was removed from the list of Executioners in 1910 after an argument with his assistant John Ellis, Thomas was reported to have said about John Ellis that \"it was impossible to work with him\". == Executions == *William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw) *Ruth Ellis *James Corbitt *John Amery == Family == *Henry Pierrepoint (30 November 1877 - 14 December 1922) - Father *Thomas Pierrepoint (1870 - 11 February 1954) - Uncle Category:1905 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Bradford",
