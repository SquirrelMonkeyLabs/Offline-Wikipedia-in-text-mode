The word comes from the word \"disc\", which is the most commonly used term for describing the format used most for sound recordings in the 20th century, and the -graph suffix meaning something written.discography. Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1), Random House, Inc. Retrieved on November 11, 2008. A listing of all recordings of a musician or singer is usually called their \"discography\". Discographies may also be created based on a particular musical genre or record label, for example, so that all artists in a genre, or that have contracts with a certain label, are listed together. The term \"discography\" became popular in the 1930s by collectors of jazz records. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records, as record companies did not commonly include that information on/with the records at that time. ==Related pages== * Audio engineering == References == == Other websites == * \"Magnificent Obsession: The Discographers\" article by Jerry Atkins",
