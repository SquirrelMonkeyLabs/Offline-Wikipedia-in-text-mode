 "text": "\"No Tears Left to Cry\" (written in lowercase) is a song by American singer Ariana Grande. It is the lead single from her fourth studio album, Sweetener. The song and its music video were released on April 20, 2018. The song became Grande and Grimes's first chart-topper in Australia when it entered at the top of the ARIA Singles Chart. It entered at number two in the UK and at three in her home country of the US. With the song, she became the first act to have the first singles from four albums enter in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. ==Background== After taking a break from social media since New Year's Eve 2017, Grande promoted the release of the song on social media using upside-down, flipped font (ʎɹɔ oʇ ʇɟǝl sɹɐǝʇ ou). Meaghan Garvey from Pitchfork called the song \"diva house\" and the beat \"UK garage-inspired,\" perhaps as a \"nod to Manchester,\" referring to the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing in England that occurred on Grande's Dangerous Woman Tour. == Music video == The video features Grande and Grimes in a city with dancers and climbing up buildings and streets at right angles. It was nominated at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Pop Video, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Video of the Year, winning the first of these. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2018) Peak position Argentina (Argentina Hot 100) 78 Bolivia (Monitor Latino) 13 Brazil (Top 100 Brasil) 94 Colombia (National-Report) 54 Costa Rica (Monitor Latino) 2 Croatia Airplay (HRT) 7 Dominican Republic (SODINPRO) 17 Ecuador (National- Report) 59 El Salvador (Monitor Latino) 16 Estonia (IFPI) 1 Euro Digital Songs (Billboard) 2 France (SNEP) 3 Greece Digital Singles (IFPI) 1 Guatemala (Monitor Latino) 2 Iceland (Tonlist) 1 Israel (Media Forest) 1 Latvia (Latvijas Top 40) 2 Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20) 6 Malaysia (RIM) 1 Mexico (Mexico Airplay) 2 Netherlands (Mega Top 50) 2 Panama (Monitor Latino) 9 Romania (Airplay 100) Note: User may scroll down the 'Podcasturi' menu to play or download the respective podcast. 77 Serbia (Radiomonitor) 3 Singapore (RIAS) 1 Slovenia (SloTop50) 3 South Korea International (Gaon Chart) 19 Venezuela (National-Report) 94 ===Monthly charts=== Chart (2018) Peak position Brazil Streaming (Pro-Música Brasil) 33 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2018) Position Argentina (Monitor Latino) 94 Australia (ARIA) 26 Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40) 53 Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) 17 Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia) 32 Canada (Canadian Hot 100) 13 Denmark (Tracklisten) 42 Estonia (IFPI) 18 France (SNEP) 86 Germany (Official German Charts) 61 Hungary (Rádiós Top 40) 64 Hungary (Single Top 40) 20 Hungary (Stream Top 40) 20 Ireland (IRMA) 10 Israel (Galgalatz) 10 Japan (Japan Hot 100) 89 Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard) 5 Japan Streaming Songs (Billboard Japan) 61 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 9 Netherlands (Mega Top 50) 8 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 34 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 46 Poland (ZPAV) 39 Portugal (AFP) 40 Slovenia (SloTop50) 18 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) 45 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) 36 UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 9 US Billboard Hot 100 20 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 39 US Adult Top 40 (Billboard) 16 US Dance Club Songs (Billboard) 23 US Dance/Mix Show Airplay (Billboard) 10 US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) 14 US Rhythmic (Billboard) 45 Chart (2019) Position Portugal (AFP) 244 Slovenia (SloTop50) 37 == References == ===Notes=== Category:2018 songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Disco songs Category:R&B; songs Category:Ariana Grande songs",
