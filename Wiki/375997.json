 "text": "The 1952 United States presidential election happened on November 4, 1952. This election was between Governor of Illinois Adlai Stevenson and General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower won the election by 442 electoral votes. Adlai Stevenson got only 89 electoral votes. Incumbent President Harry S. Truman was eligible to run again because the newly passed 22nd amendment did not apply to the incumbent president at that time. Truman chose not to run, so the Democratic Party nominated Adlai Stevenson. Eisenhower was 62 when he won the election. This was the first time an older candidate was elected since James Buchanan was elected in 1856 at 65, something that wouldn't happen again until 69-year old Ronald Reagan won the 1980 election. ==Candidates== ===Democratic Party=== Democratic candidates: *Adlai Stevenson II, Governor of Illinois *Estes Kefauver, U.S. Senator from Tennessee *Richard Russell, Jr., U.S. Senator from Georgia *W.
