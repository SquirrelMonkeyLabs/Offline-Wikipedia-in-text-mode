The order has only one class and is exclusively for men.https://www.britannica.com/topic/Order-of- the-Chrysanthemum The badge consists of a white enameled star with 32 rays edged in gold with a central cabochon garnet surrounded by a gold band. Four small silver chrysanthemums placed between green leaves encircle the garnet. The medal is suspended from a large, gold-rimmed likeness of a chrysanthemum. Apart from the Imperial Family, only seven Japanese citizens have ever been decorated with the collar in their lifetimes; the last such award was to former Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi in 1928. Eight others have been posthumously decorated with the collar; the last such award was to former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2022. Today, only the reigning Emperor holds this dignity as sovereign of the order; however, exceptions are made for foreign heads of state, who can be awarded the collar in friendship. The grand cordon is the highest possible honour a Japanese citizen can be awarded during his or her lifetime. Aside from members of the Imperial Family, 53 Japanese citizens have been decorated with the grand cordon; of these, only 23 were living at the time of receipt == References == Category:Japanese culture Category:Orders, decorations, and medals",
