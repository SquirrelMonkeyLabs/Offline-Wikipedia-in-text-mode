 "text": "Wax is an organic chemical substance. It is a type of lipid. Waxes are soft, and easy to shape at room temperature. They are hydrophobic (meaning they repel water and are repelled by water), and they cannot be dissolved in water. The melting point of waxes is above 45Â°C. Some waxes, like beeswax, vegetable wax, and paraffin (a petroleum wax) occur naturally. Another such wax is earwax, which occurs in the ear. Other waxes are manufactured. People use waxes for various purposes, including waxing, waxed paper, and wax tablets. Category:Lipids",
