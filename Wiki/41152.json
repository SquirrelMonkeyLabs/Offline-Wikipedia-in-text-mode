Platform 1, the northernmost platform. The station's main entrance is from St. John's Hill, into a foot tunnel which is 15 ft (4.6 m) wide. It runs under the eastern end of the 17 platforms, and to a northern exit, which has restricted opening hours. The foot tunnel becomes very crowded during the morning and evening rush hours, and ticket barriers at the end of the tunnel are a particular pinch point. A covered footbridge connects the platforms at their western end. The footbridge does not have an exit to or from the station. ==The Junction== The station is named Clapham Junction because it is close to the joining point of a number of major rail linesâ€”although the name is not shared by any junction near the station. The names of the nearby rail junctions are: * Falcon Jn * Ludgate GW Jn * Latchmere Jns * West London Jn * Pouparts Jn ==References== == Other websites == * Mirror of the Unofficial CJ Guide (original site seems to have been removed) * Short History of Clapham Junction prepared by Wandsworth Council, and from which much of the information in the history section of this entry is sourced. * BBC News report on the 1988 train collisions Category:London Overground stations Category:London Travelcard zone 2 Category:Railway stations opened in 1863 Category:Transport in the London Borough of Wandsworth",
