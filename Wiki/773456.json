The whistling tree frog, fawn tree frog, Verrreaux's Alpine tree frog, Alpine tree frog or Verreaux's tree frog (Litoria verreauxii) is a small frog from Australia. It is named after its loud call, which sounds like a bird call. There are two subspecies: L. v. verreauxii lives in many kinds of places, including swamps, forests and permanent bodies of water and L. v. alpina, called the alpine tree frog, lives higher above sea level. L. v. alpina is much rarer. The IUCN Red List says the whistling tree frog is not endangered overall, but the government of Australia and its states say the alpine subspecies is endangered. This frogs lays eggs in groups of 500-1000 at a time on underwater plants. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
