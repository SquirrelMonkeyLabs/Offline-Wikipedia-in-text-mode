She had white spots on her belly. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for the Greek words astralos for \"spotted\" and gaster for \"stomach.\" Together, they mean \"starry belly.\" ==Home== Scientists saw the frog near streams in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 700 and 900 meters above sea level. Scientists have not seen the frog inside Chagres National Park, but they think it may live there. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out.
