 "text": "Wensleydale is a sort of cheese originally produced in Wensleydale, North Yorkshire. It is now mostly made in large commercial creameries in England. It was started by French Cistercian monks who had settled in northern England. Local farmers carried on making it after the monastery was dissolved in 1540. Wensleydale cheese was made more popular by the Wallace and Gromit series. ==References== Category:English cheeses Category:North Yorkshire",
