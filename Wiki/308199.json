 "text": "Insulin resistance is a serious condition in which insulin becomes less able to lower the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Usually, insulin helps sugar move out of the blood and into the body's cells. In the cells, the body can use sugar to make energy. If this does not happen correctly, too much sugar stays in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. If the blood glucose level is above normal for a long time, this can lead to major health problems. Insulin resistance often causes certain types of diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults. A condition called 'metabolic syndrome' is strongly tied to insulin resistance. == Signs and symptoms == # High blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) # Fatigue, and sleepiness, especially after meals. # Brain fogginess and inability to focus (can't think clearly). # Weight gain, fat storage, difficulty losing weight. # High blood pressure (hypertension) # Increased thirst (called polydipsia) and hunger (called polyphagia) == Treatment == ===Self-care=== # Eat less carbohydrates, and very much less direct sugar. # Take more exercise, long walks, activity. == Standard medical test == #Blood sugar level test after 12 hours starvation.
