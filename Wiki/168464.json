 "text": "A howitzer is a special type of big gun used by an army. It has a short barrel, and is used to fire a shell over a short distance. The barrel length of a howitzer is 15 to 25 times of the caliber. Howitzers are special because they're made to fire higher than a cannon but lower than a mortar. Howitzers are almost always used to shoot at targets on the ground, but they can be used for targets on water, or in the air. The name howitzer comes from an old Czech word, haufnice, which was a catapult that could fire many stones. The sinking of the USS Maine was most responsible for causing the Spanish-American War. On February 15th, 1898, the USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor and sank, killing over 260 of those stationed to the boat. ==Related pages== *List of howitzers ==References==",
