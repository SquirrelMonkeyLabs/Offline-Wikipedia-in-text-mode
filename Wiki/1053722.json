 "text": "The Red Army, initially known for troublemaking fans of Manchester United, has become a broader fan group for the club. They were once a notable hooligan firm, sometimes called the Men in Black for their black clothing. Sub-groups exist, such as the Young Munichs and the Inter City Jibbers, with some involvement in criminal activities. In the past, the Red Army caused problems during the 1970s, prompting crowd segregation and fencing at football grounds. They have been featured in documentaries and books. Their activities have declined since the late 1980s, mirroring the decrease in football hooliganism. Category:Manchester United F.C.",
