 "text": "An ofrenda (Spanish: \"offering\") is a collection of objects placed on a display during the annual and traditionally Mexican DÃ­a de Muertos celebration. An ofrenda, which can be large is usually created for an individual person who has died and is intended to welcome them. They are filled with the deceased personal objects, picture of the person and food. == Elements == An ofrenda can be decorated with Marigolds. The Marigold's purpose in an ofrenda is to attract the souls of those who died with the use of the plant's vibrant colors and its fragrance. They can also be used to set up a path fro the souls to find their way back home. Candles are also used to guide the souls of those who are returning back to the living. Pictures of the deceased person are placed at the top of the altar to show who is being celebrated and welcomed back. Food and beverages are also included in the ofrenda as a peace offering and nourishment for the souls after their journey back to the living world. Pan de Muerto is also included in the ofrenda as it is a bread that is traditionally baked to symbolize the cycle of life and death. Sugar skulls are also included in ofrendas to symbolize the sweetness of life and death. Papel picado is used to decorate the ofrenda to add color and also it symbolizes how fragile life is and it is also used to represent wind and air. ==References== Category:Mexican culture",
