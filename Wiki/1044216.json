Maurice was a successful and skilled general and as a result, Emperor Tiberius II chose him as his heir and son-in-law. His reign was marked as troubled constant warfare from the Avars and Slavs in the Balkans, Lombards in itlay, and the Persians from the East. Maurice was able to secure a large amount of land in the caucasus from Persia in exchange for helping Khosrow II get back to the sasanian throne. Although he was successful in the battlefields and foreign policies, he evetually faced mounting financial crises ehich made him unpopular. The army eventually proclaimed Phocas as their new emperor and deposed Maurice. While escaping with his family, they were caught and was executed by Phocas.
