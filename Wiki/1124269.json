 "text": "The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) is a political party in Malaysia. It was founded in 1949 to represent the Chinese community in the country. The MCA is part of the Barisan Nasional coalition, which ruled Malaysia for many years. The party focuses on issues important to the Chinese community, such as education, economy, and cultural preservation. In the 2018 Malaysian general election, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) suffered a historic defeat, winning only one seat in Parliament. This was the worst performance in the party's history. Since then, MCA has been trying to rebuild and regain its influence but faces many challenges. ==Presidents== #Tan Cheng Lock (1949-1958) #Lim Chong Eu (1958-1959) #Cheah Toon Lok (acting) (1959-1961) #Tan Siew Sin (1961-1974) #Lee San Choon (1974-1983) #Neo Yee Pan (acting) (1983-1985) #Tan Koon Swan (1985-1986) #Ling Liong Sik (1986-2003) #Ong Ka Ting (2003-2008) #Ong Tee Keat (2008-2010) #Chua Soi Lek (2010-2013) #Liow Tiong Lai (2013-2018) #Wee Ka Siong (2018-) Category:1949 establishments in Asia Category:20th-century establishments in Malaysia Category:Political parties in Malaysia",
