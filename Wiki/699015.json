 "text": "The Cree ( in Cree language; in French) are one of the First Nations in North America. They are one of the largest groups. In Canada, over 350,000 people are Cree or have Cree ancestors. Most Cree in Canada live in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. About 27,868 of them live in Quebec. During their history in the United States, Cree people lived west of Lake Superior. Today, they live mostly in Montana, in the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation. Ojibwe (Chippewa) people also live in that reservation. They have moved west over time because they were traders and hunters.Alexander Mackenzie, Voyages from Montreal Through the Continent of North America to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans in 1789 and 1793. == References == Category:First Nations",
