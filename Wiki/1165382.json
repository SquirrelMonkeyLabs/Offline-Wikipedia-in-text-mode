 "text": "Nickelodeon Universe is a series of indoor amusement parks including locations in The Mall of America (Bloomington, Minnesota) and the American Dream mall (East Rutherford, New Jersey), with a third location under construction in the Mall of China (Chongqing, China). These parks are based off of Nickelodeon’s most popular series and characters. == Mall of America == === History === ==== Camp Snoopy ==== The park opened as Camp Snoopy, and was themed around the Peanuts characters. Camp Snoopy was calmingly themed with a very outdoors, \"woodsy\" feel with references to Peanuts throughout. Much of the original theming was already toned down before rights to the characters were lost. Some theming was lost before the closure, including various kites near the ceiling, Charlie Brown and Lucy playing baseball above the Sports Grill restaurant, the Snoopy fountain, some of the shops and other smaller details. In 2005, there were plans to modernize Camp Snoopy, including the introduction of a new logo in October, the new roller coaster logo unveiled to replace the old canoe logo. These plans did not last long, due to the closure in the following months. ==== The Park at Mall of America ==== On January 9, 2006, Staff announced that starting January 19, the park's Peanuts branding would end. The park was renamed to The Park at MOA while new branding was being applied. All traces of the Peanuts branding was removed, some sloppily. ==== Nickelodeon Universe ==== The park's new name was announced on July 25, 2007, and the park was completed on March 15, 2008. New rides include SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, and the Splat-O-Sphere (a drop tower in the center of the park). The Mystery Mine Ride was demolished to make way for the new SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge. On March 12, 2008, Star Tribune reported that the price of ride points, daily wristbands and, annual passes, would become significantly more expensive at the full opening of Nickelodeon Universe. Some denounced the price increases as being too high compared to other parks, such as local Valleyfair at $79.95–$99.95. Others defended the price as necessary because of the millions of dollars needed to rebrand the park as Nickelodeon Universe. On March 17, 2020, Nickelodeon Universe closed along with the rest of Mall of America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the mall re- opened in June, Nickelodeon Universe stayed closed until August. As a result of restrictions put in place by the Minnesota state government, Nickelodeon Universe was only permitted to re-open to a capacity of 250. On May 28, 2021, the park was reopened to full capacity. === Rides and attractions === ==== Roller coasters ==== Name Opened Manufacturer Make/model Notes Pepsi Orange Streak 1992 Zierer Tivoli - Custom Formerly known as Pepsi Ripsaw (1992-2007) Fairly Odd Coaster 2004 Gerstlauer Spinning Coaster - 420/4 Formerly known as Timberland Twister (2004–2007).
