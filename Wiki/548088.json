Though it was not as successful as Picha's previous movie, it was entered into the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. Picha was encouraged to address another subject, that of Darwin and his theory of evolution. Production lasted from 1965 to 1979. In 1974, Picha left for Tarzoon:Shame of the Jungle. In 1977, 2 years after Tarzoon's release, Picha returned to the project and selected Columbia Pictures as the movie's distributor. In 1980, the movie was completed and released. ==References== Category:1980 comedy movies Category:French animated movies Category:Belgian movies",
