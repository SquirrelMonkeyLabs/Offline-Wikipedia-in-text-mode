Its prefecture is Bourg-en-Bresse. ==History== Ain is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790 with Bourg-en-Bresse as is capital. It was formed with four former provinces: Bresse, Bugey, Dombes, Pays de Gex and part of the province of Franc-Lyonnais. It was divided in nine districts: Pont-de- Vaux, Bourg, Nantua, Gex, Belley, Saint-Rambert, Montluel, Trévoux and Châtillon-les-Dombes. The department was called départment of Bresse but in 1791 was changed to its present name: départment de l'Ain. In 1798, Gex was separated from Ain for the creation of the old department of Léman. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the nine districts were changed into four arrondissements: Bourg, Belley, Nantua and Trévoux. The department of Léman was eliminated in 1814 and Gex was again part of the department of Ain. In 1815, some communes of Gex are passed to Switzerland and the arrondissement of Gex is created. On 10 September 1926, the arrondissements of Gex and Trévoux were eliminated but in 1933 Gex was made again an arrondissement. ==Geography== Ain is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region.
