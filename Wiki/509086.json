 "text": "A catadioptric sensor is a visual sensor that contains mirrors and lenses. Video cameras are limited as to how much they can see in one view. They can lose sight of what they are recording if something causes them to move suddenly. Mirrors can be carefully arranged with lenses to allow the camera lens to see a wide angle view. They are often used in robotics and in astronomical telescopes. One example is a catadioptric sensor used to inspect the inside of a cylindrical pipe. == References == Category:Optics Category:Sensors",
