 "text": "Super Mario World is a platform game made by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the fifth Super Mario game. In the game, Mario travels through seven worlds to defeat his enemy Bowser. The game adds new things that were not in the previous Mario games. Yoshi appears in this game for the first time. Super Mario World sold very well: it sold more than 20 million copies. Many gamers think that the game is one of the best games ever made. The game was remade for the Game Boy Advance, called Super Mario Advance 2; the other games in the Mario series were remade for it also. An animated television series based on the game aired in 1991 on NBC. ==Plot== In this game, Bowser has kidnapped Princess Toadstool again after she, Mario, and Luigi had a vacation in Dinosaur Land. Mario and Luigi must rescue her and seven Yoshi eggs from Bowser and his Koopalings. ==Gameplay== This game adds several new mechanics, most notably the introduction of Yoshi, a rideable dinosaur companion. Mario can free Yoshi from eggs hidden in blocks where Bowser and the Koopalings have trapped him. When Mario releases him, he can jump on an adult Yoshi's back to ride him. While riding Yoshi, Mario can make Yoshi shoot out his tongue to catch and eat items and enemies and can jump off Yoshi's back. If the egg spawns a baby Yoshi, Mario can carry the Yoshi and it will automatically consume enemies and items until it grows into a full adult. There are four colors of Yoshi: Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow. Green Yoshi is the default, Red can shoot fireballs if they spit out items, Blue can fly, and Yellow have a stronger ground slam. Green Yoshis can also copy the powers of the other Yoshis by capturing a matching-colored Koopa Shell, but will eventually swallow items held in its mouth. This game also has a new item called the cape feather. The cape feather both enlarges Mario to full size and gives him a cape. When Cape Mario gets a running start, he can fly in the air and hang there for a short period of time. He can spin the cape to also knock out enemies. He can also come down at a steep angle and pound the ground to knock enemies out. The inventory system has been changed. Mario has one box at the top of the screen where he can store one item. If Mario goes back to small Mario, the item will start dropping right away. As with other Mario games, gameplay primarily consists of completing sidescrolling stages in a set time limit, while avoiding obstacles and enemies. Many stages, indicated by a red icon in the Overworld screen, have multiple exits leading to shortcuts or secret stages. Stages are grouped in the map into various worlds, with each having a mini-boss castle and a final castle. The final castle of each world is guarded by one of the Koopalings and Mario must strike the boss three times or force them into lava to defeat them and progress. ==Music== Kōji Kondō made all of the music for the game. He used only an electronic keyboard to make the songs. Some melodies were used again in later Mario games. Almost all of the songs in the game are different versions of the same melody. ==Development== ==Reception== Reviewers really liked Super Mario World when it first came out. The game is still very much liked by reviewers today. Many claim it is one of the best-selling video games ever made. == Cancelled sequel == In the 1990’s there was a sequel game called Super Mario's Wacky Worlds which was based on historical locations, including Ancient Greece and Egypt, but it got cancelled. ==References== Category:1990 video games Category:Mario platform games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development games Category:Pack-in video games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games about dinosaurs Category:Video games about vacationing Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U",
