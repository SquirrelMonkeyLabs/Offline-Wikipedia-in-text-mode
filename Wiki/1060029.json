 "text": "The WAGR C class were a total of 3 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1962 to 1992. The C class were built by English Electric of Rocklea, Brisbane, Queensland in 1962, being originally assigned to passenger trains like the Australind, The Kalgoorlie, and The Westland. Later on, they could be found hauling suburban traffic around Perth in addition to shunting Avon, Forestfield and Geraldton yards. All three were withdrawn in 1992 after the Perth suburban network became fully electrified. All three survive today under the ownership of the Hotham Valley Railway with No. 1701 displayed at Pinjarra, while No. 1702 is operational along with No. 1703 which is allowed to run on the mainline. == Gallery == Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives File:C1702 Busselton, 1986.JPG|No. 1702 passing through Busselton with a Hotham Valley tour train in 1986.
