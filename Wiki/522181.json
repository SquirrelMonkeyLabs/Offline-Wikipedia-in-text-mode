 "text": "Derogation (Latin derogatio) is the relaxation or exemption from of a rule of law. This is as opposed to a repeal or ending of a law. The term is used in both civil law and common law. It is sometimes used, loosely, to mean abrogation. For example in the legal maxim: Lex posterior derogat priori which means a more recent law may overrule an earlier law. Derogation is different from dispensation (an exception to a law) in that it applies to the law. A dispensation applies to specific people who are affected by the law. In terms of European Union legislation, a derogation can also imply that a member state delays putting into effect a part of an European Union regulation (etc.) into their own legal system.Derogation â€“ EU Jargon This can be for a period of time such as five years. Or that a member state has decided not to enforce a specific provision in a treaty due to internal circumstances (typically a state of emergency). == Related pages == * Repeal * Implied repeal * Canon law ==References== == Other websites == * Catholic Encyclopedia Derogation Category:Law Category:Legal terms",
