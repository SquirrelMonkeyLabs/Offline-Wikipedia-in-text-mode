 "text": "Game pie is a kind of meat pie made with game. It has been made since Roman times. Its main ingredients, then and now, are wild birds and animals such as partridge, pheasant, deer and hare. The pies became very elaborate during the 18th century in England. They developed complex recipes and special moulds and serving dishes. The versions cooked today are more simple, but they still include rabbit, venison, pigeon, pheasant, and other game meats.Mark Hix Game pie ; Serves 4–6 26 November 2005 Independent The Oreiller de la Belle Aurore is an elaborate game pie named after Claudine-Aurore Récamier, the mother of Brillat-Savarin.
