The October 10, 2006 SVT confirmed that Agnes would participate in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 2007 with her song \"More than a girl\", but she got disqualified because she talked about the song in an interview with Aftonbladet. She is the third only Idol winner who was previously a Wildcard on the show, next to Canada's Ryan Malcolm and Kazakhstan's Almas Kishkenbayev. Agnes advanced to the finals as the jury's choice. She has released a song called \"Release Me\", which became a huge hit for Agnes. == Discography == * Agnes (2005) * Stronger (2006) * Dance! Love! Pop!
