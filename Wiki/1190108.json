 "text": "Here I Am 1998-2003 is the fifth album by Ilse DeLange, this album was released in the same year as her album Clean Up, namely in 2003. It was a compilation album with her biggest hits up to that point. It is known that DeLange signed a contract with her former record label Warner Music for 5 albums. At the end of 2003, this compilation album was suddenly released, while the previous (fourth) album Clean Up had not even been out for half a year. When the Dutch division of Warner Music was closed down in early 2004, rumors circulated that this was the reason why a DeLange compilation album was suddenly released. Apparently, there was no time left to record a completely new album, which is why a compilation album was chosen. However, this has never been confirmed by Warner Music or by DeLange. The album (which achieved gold status) includes the hits I'm Not So Tough, Livin' On Love and Shine, a duet with Rosemary's Sons. The album also features her biggest hit to date, Before You Let Me Go, a duet with the band Kane. In the Album Top 100, the album reached number 5 and was listed for a total of 30 weeks.",
