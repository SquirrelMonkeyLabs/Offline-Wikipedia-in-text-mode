 "text": "Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is a oil painting by Albert Chevallier Tayler in 1906. The chairman of the Kent County Cricket Club, Lord Harris, wanted to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after spending time with each of the Kent players one by one. The painting mostly stayed at Kent's St Lawrence Ground until 1999 when it was moved to Lord's Cricket Ground. Kent could no longer afford to insure it. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to the Andrew Brownsword Art Foundation at an auction. The painting is currently on display at the Lord's Pavilion. ==Sources== Category:Cricket in England and Wales Category:1900s paintings Category:1906 works",
