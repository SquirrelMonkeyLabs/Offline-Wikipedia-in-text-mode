His hits included \"Mack the Knife\", \"Dream Lover\", \"If I Were a Carpenter\", \"Splish Splash\", and \"Beyond the Sea\". He also helped Wayne Newton begin his musical career. == Career == Allen Klein, an accountant who became an artist manager, first came to public attention when he audited Darin's royalty payments, and discovered Darin had been underpaid. His record company paid up, and Darin split the money with Klein. Darin was married to actress Sandra Dee from 1960 to 1967. They had a son, named Dodd. Darin died late in 1973 after heart surgery. In 2004, a movie, Beyond the Sea, was made about Darin's life and career. Actor Kevin Spacey, a longtime Darin fan, produced and starred in the movie, with Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee. ==Other websites== *Hear Bobby Darin on the Pop Chronicles Category:Singers from New York City Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:1936 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from the Bronx",
