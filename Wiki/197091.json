 "text": "50000 Quaoar (symbol: ) is a Trans-Neptunian object and is also a dwarf planet. It was discovered on June 4, 2002 by Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown at the California Institute of Technology. Quaoar has one known moon, named Weywot. It also has a ring. Unexpectedly, the ring is at twice the distance of the Roche limit, which was thought to be the maximum distance of a ring: beyond the Roche limit, the particles in a ring should clump together and form a moon; yet this has not happened to Quaoar's ring. It is thought that the particles do not clump together because of tides created by Weywot. There may also be small shepherd moons on either side of the ring, as there are at Saturn's F Ring. == References == == Other websites == * Quaoar discoverers' webpage * Orbital simulation from JPL (Java) /Ephemeris Category:Kuiper belt objects Category:Dwarf planets",
