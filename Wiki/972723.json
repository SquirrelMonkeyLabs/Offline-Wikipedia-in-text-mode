 "text": "The Hyloscirtus diabolus is a frog. It lives in Peru. Scientists have seen it in exactly two places: cloud forests on the east side of the Corillera Central mountains. This frog is large for a tree frog. Adults frogs can be 82.3â€“89.2 mm long from nose to rear end not counting the legs. This frog has thick, strong front legs. Scientists saw large vomerine teeth in its jaws. The skin of the back and sides is gray-brown or dark gray in color. There is some pink and orange color on the insides of the legs. The skin of the belly is red-gray in color. The climbing disks on the toes are brown in color. Sometimes there are tiny yellow spots on the toes. The iris of the eye is dark red in color. The scientists named the frog diabolus after the Devil. Its strong front legs, gray skin, bumpy spine, large teeth, and especially its red eyes made it look fearsome to them. It reminded them of the way artists show the Devil. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
