 "text": "The Grand Mosque of Damascus, also known as the Umayyad Mosque (Arabic: جامع بني أمية الكبير, transl. Ğām' Banī 'Umayyah al-Kabīr), is one of the largest and oldest mosques in the world.It is in one of the holiest sites in the old city of Damascus. It is also very important because of its architecture. The mosque holds a shrine which is said to contain the head of John the Baptist (Yahya), honored as a prophet by Muslims and Christians alike. The head was supposedly found during the excavations for the building of the mosque. The tomb of Saladin stands in a small garden adjoining the north wall of the mosque. In 2001, Pope John Paul II visited the mosque, primarily to visit the relics of John the Baptist. It was the first time a pope paid a visit to a mosque. == Images == Image:StJohnTheBaptistShrine Damascus 1943.jpg|The Shrine with the head of St. John the Baptist Image:StJohnInUmmayad.jpg|John the Baptist (or Yahya)'s Shrine inside the Mosque Image:Umayyad Mosque-Dome of the Treasury.jpg|The courtyard of the Mosque with the ancient Treasury (Beit al Mal) Image:Syria, Damascus, The Umayyad Mosque.jpg Syria, Damascus, The Umayyad Mosque, Islam in Syria.jpg Damascus, Syria, The Umayyad Mosque, Great Mosque of Banu Umayya.jpg Category:Damascus Category:Holy places in Islam Category:Mosques in Asia Category:8th-century buildings and structures",
