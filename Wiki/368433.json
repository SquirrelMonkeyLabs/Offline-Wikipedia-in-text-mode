 "text": "Pinaceae (the pine family) are trees or shrubs, including many of the well- known conifers of commercial importance such as cedars, firs, hemlocks, larches, pines and spruces. The family is included in the order Pinales, formerly known as Coniferales. Pinaceae are monophyletic. They are the largest living conifer family in species diversity, with between 220-250 species in 11 genera, and the second-largest (after Cupressaceae) in geographical range. They are found in most of the Northern Hemisphere with most species in temperate climates. The family often forms the dominant component of boreal, coastal and montane forests. One species just crosses the equator in southeast Asia. Major centres of diversity are found in the mountains of southwest China, Mexico, central Japan and California.
