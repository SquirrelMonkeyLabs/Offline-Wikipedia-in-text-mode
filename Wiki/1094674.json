 "text": "== History == The previous Kaijuega of Toho's conception was growing despondent of the seriousness of a 1954 \"Gojira\" in growing favor of the sillier conventions of contemporary television series like Ultraman. Toho Company had decided to utilize a classic creation of Western literature, Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley. By this point, Frankenstein was largely realized within filmography from Universal Pictures' adaptation. Toho's attempt to bring the Frankenstein creation to life carries a humorous tone, typical of the originators of kaiju media. In their portrayal, Frankenstein's monster not only exists in Japan but is also scaled to the proportions of a Godzilla-sized creature. It faces off against a worldly competitor, the monster Baragon. While Baragon later appears in other Kaijuega films, the sizeable Frankenstein Monster is absent. ==References== Category:1965 movies",
