 "text": "The Government of the Republic of Singapore is stated by the constitution to mean the executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in their personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, their role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, which has the Prime Minister and other ministers appointed on their advice by the President, that generally controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election. ==Other websites== *YouTube profile Category:Organizations based in Singapore",
