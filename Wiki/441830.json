 "text": "Significant Other is the second studio album by American nu metal band, Limp Bizkit. Significant Other was released on June 22, 1999. The album featured the singles \"Nookie\", \"Re-Arranged\", \"N 2 Gether Now\", and \"Break Stuff\". The band performed at Woodstock '99. When they performed, the crowd turned violent especially when the band performed the song \"Break Stuff\". Many several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert. Durst announced during the concert that \"People are getting hurt. Don't let anybody get hurt. But I don't think you should mellow out. That's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick 'em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy\". Durst later said in an interview, \"I didn't see anybody getting hurt. You don't see that. When you're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you're performing, and you're feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?\". ==Songs== ==References== Category:1999 albums Category:Limp Bizkit albums Category:Nu metal albums",
