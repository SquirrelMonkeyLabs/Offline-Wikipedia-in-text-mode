Israel's attacks have killed over 800 people, injured more than 5,000, and displaced hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians. The attacks are the deadliest in Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War, and began five days after Israel did a deadly pager and walkie-talkie attack on devices intended for Hezbollah members, and three days after Israel killed Redwan Force commander Ibrahim Aqil as well as 54 others. The deadliest day was 23 September, when Israeli attacks killed 558 people, including 50 children and 94 women. After the attacks, it was reported that Israel planned an invasion of Lebanon.
