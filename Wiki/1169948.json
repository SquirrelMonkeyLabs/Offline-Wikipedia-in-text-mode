 "text": "Procrustes was a bandit in Greek mythology who invited unsuspecting victims into his bed and kill them. If the victim was too short, he would stretch their limbs out to fit the bed. If the victim was too tall, he would remove their feet with an axe and then their head. He was killed by Theseus, who tricked him to fall into his own trap. Category:People in Greek mythology",
