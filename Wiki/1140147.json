 "text": "Tawaramachi Station (田原町駅, Tawaramachi-eki) is a subway station on the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line in Taito, Tokyo, Japan. The station is numbered G-18 and is operated by Tokyo Metro. It primarily serves commuters and visitors to the historic Asakusa area, which is known for its temples, shopping streets, and culture. ==History== Tawaramachi Station opened on December 30, 1927, as part of the original section of the Ginza Line. It was the first underground railway in Japan and East Asia. Initially, the line connected Ueno Station to Asakusa Station. The Ginza Line's development was spearheaded by Tokyo Underground Railway. This later became part of Tokyo Metro after various mergers and system expansions. Since its opening, the station had several renovations to modernize its facilities, improve accessibility, and increase safety. Despite these updates, it retains much of its original charm, reflecting Tokyo's early 20th-century subway infrastructure. ==Station layout== Tawaramachi Station has a simple and functional design with one island platform serving two tracks. The platform accommodates trains traveling in both directions: one toward Asakusa Station and the other toward Shibuya Station. The station is located underground, with two exits at street level: Exit 1 and Exit 2. These exits lead to the Tawaramachi area and offer access to nearby commercial and residential districts. While the station’s platform is relatively compact compared to newer stations in Tokyo, it is equipped with essential amenities, including elevators and escalators for easier access to the platforms. ==Platform arrangement== *Track 1 – Ginza Line for Asakusa *Track 2 – Ginza Line for Shibuya ==Surrounding areas== Tawaramachi Station is in the Taito ward, which is home to many significant historical and cultural landmarks. One of the most famous attractions nearby is Asakusa, where the iconic Senso-ji Temple, one of Tokyo’s oldest and most important Buddhist temples, is located. Visitors often use Tawaramachi Station as an alternative entry point to avoid the crowds at Asakusa Station, especially during peak tourist seasons. The station is also close to Kappabashi-dori, a street renowned for its many shops specializing in kitchenware and restaurant supplies. This area, also known as Kappabashi Street, is a destination for chefs and food industry professionals, but it also attracts tourists interested in browsing its unique goods. The station's proximity to both Asakusa and Ueno makes it a convenient stop for those interested in exploring Tokyo’s blend of historical and modern sites. From Tawaramachi, it is just a short walk to Nakamise Shopping Street, a popular destination for traditional souvenirs and local snacks. ==Passenger statistics== As of recent records, Tawaramachi Station handles an average of 30,000 passengers daily. Its usage peaks during the holiday seasons and festivals in Asakusa, particularly during events like the Sanja Matsuri in May, when visitors flock to the area. Despite being one of the smaller stations on the Ginza Line, it plays an important role in the local transit network due to its location near popular tourist destinations. ==Accessibility== Tawaramachi Station is equipped with modern accessibility features, including: *Elevators connecting the platform to the street level. *Escalators for easy access to both the platform and exits. *Tactile paving for the visually impaired, guiding passengers through the station. In recent years, Tokyo Metro made upgrades to meet the needs of an aging population and ensure that the station can accommodate all passengers, including those with disabilities. ==Nearby stations== *Asakusa Station (G-19) on the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line – approximately 1 minute by train. *Inaricho Station (G-17) on the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line – approximately 1 minute by train. Tawaramachi’s position between these two stations makes it a convenient transfer point for passengers traveling on the eastern portion of the Ginza Line. ==Future developments== While no major expansions are planned for Tawaramachi Station itself, ongoing infrastructure improvements across the Tokyo Metro network are expected to enhance the overall passenger experience. These improvements include more efficient train scheduling, additional signage in multiple languages, and better integration with surface transportation options like buses and taxis. ==References== # Tokyo Metro Ginza Line Station Information.
