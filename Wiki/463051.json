The Twins were thought of as minor gods. They were called Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra. These names meant 'The One who has arisen from the Underworld' and the 'Mighty King'. Both names can be understood as titles of Nergal, the major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence. He was king of the Underworld.Babylonian Star-lore by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 125 ==Visualizations== Castor and Pollux are the brightest stars in Gemini.
