 "text": "In Greek mythology, Eudoros () was one of the Myrmidons as well as the second of five commanders who served under Achilles during the Trojan War. He was a demigod, son of Hermes and Polymele. According to the Iliad, he commanded ten penteconters and five hundred Myrmidons. In Book XVI of the Iliad, when Patroclus readies Achilles's men, Homer talks about him for fourteen lines - more than any of the other commanders in this passage. He is also the second most notable of the five, beaten only by Phoenix. == References == Category:People in Greek mythology",
