It was first opened in 1925. It collaborates with Ludwig Maximilian Universität München, and TU München. The main site is located on an island in the river Isar. Oskar von Miller founded the museum. One of the concepts of the museum is to help visitors discover new technology, or how things work. For this reason, the phrase \"In diesem Museum darf jeder machen, was ich will\" (In this museum, everyone may do what I want) is visible near the entrance.
