 "text": "Kool-Aid is an American brand of flavored drink mix. The product is owned by Kraft Foods. == History == Kool-Aid was invented by Edwin Perkins in Hastings, Nebraska. Before Kool-Aid, there was a liquid drink called Fruit Smack. To cut down shipping costs, Perkins found a way to remove the liquid from Fruit Smack and leave only a powder. The powder was called \"Kool-Aid\". Perkins moved his production to Chicago in 1931. Kool-Aid was sold to General Foods in 1953. Kool-Aid is usually sold in powder form, in packets and small tubs. The actual beverage is made by mixing the substance with water and sugar. But there are some sugar-free varieties. The drink is usually served with ice or refrigerated and then served chilled. The Kool-Aid Man is associated with Kool-Aid. He was created in the 1950s. He was made over in 2013. ==References== Category:Soft drinks Category:History of Chicago",
