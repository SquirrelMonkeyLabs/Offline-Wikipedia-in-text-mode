 "text": "The Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) was an organisation started in 1939 by Basil Dean and Leslie Henson to provide entertainment for the British armed forces during World War II. It later turned into Combined Services Entertainment which since 1982 operates as part of the Services Sound and Vision Corporation. Many people who started in ENSA went on to careers in the entertainment industry after the war, including actors Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers and Kenneth Connor. It was spread thin over the vast area it had to cover. Thus many entertainments were not very good. The popular translation of the acronym ENSA was \"Every Night Something Awful\". ==References== Category:Military of the United Kingdom Category:World War II Category:Entertainment",
