After Born and Raised, he had to have throat surgery to fix a growth that forced him to stop singing for a few months. When his throat healed, he recorded and released Paradise Valley. A few years later, he joined a few surviving members of the Grateful Dead to form Dead and Company. Since 2013, he has released two albums, The Search for Everything and Sob Rock. == References == == Other websites == * Official John Mayer site * Official John Mayer Trio site * Mayer's MySpace page * Mayer's blog at Honeyee.com * Mayer's photoblog at StunningNikon.com Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American blues musicians Category:American rock guitarists Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American soul musicians Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:Musicians from Connecticut Category:People from Bridgeport, Connecticut Category:Singers from Connecticut Category:American bloggers",
