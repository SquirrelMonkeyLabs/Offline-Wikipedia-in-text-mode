 "text": "Kenneth Gbagi (22 September 1961 - 4 May 2024), also known as Kenneth Omemavwa Gbagi, was a Nigerian politician, industrialist and lawyer. He was also a former Minister of Education. He hailed from Oginibo and was considered as \"one of the finest figures of the Urhobo nation\". Gbagi was also a renowned \"criminologist and incorruptible leader\" who seemed to be full \"of pedigree and competence\", especially during his political career. ==Political career== Gbagi was a former Minister of State for Education during the regime of former President Goodluck Jonathan. In the ensuing years, he ran for governorship under the platform of Social Democratic Party (SDP) but was defeated by Sheriff Oborevwori of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). ==Philanthropy== Gbagi was a philanthropist. According to Isaiah Ogedegbe, Gbagi was noted for \"his immense contribution to the development of his community\". During his funeral service held on 12 July 2024, the Catholic Bishop of Warri Diocese, Most Revd. Anthony Ovayero Ewherido, represented by the Very Revd. Fr. Ambrose Oghenejode Abaka, in his sermon called Gbagi \"a generous man who was handy for distressed people within and outside the country\". ==Legal impact== Also, Gbagi's remarkable impact in the legal arena has not gone unnoticed, with a tribute by Isaiah Ogedegbe describing him as \"one of the conscientious defenders of truth and justice in the country\". In the same vein, Prince Adewole Adebayo also opined that: \"Chief Kenneth Gbagi was always ahead of the owner of the fight once justice was at stake\". Governor Sheriff Oborevwori of Delta State was also reported to have paid tribute, acknowledging Gbagi as \"a pathfinder, a conscientious public servant and a politician of repute\". Following the Adeje fire disaster on 10 July 2000 which claimed over 250 lives, Gbagi seemed to have spoken truth to power, when he stated that: \"Rather than the government to blame the poor and traumatised people of Adeje for the disaster, it should rather blame itself\". ==Controversy== According to a BBC News Pidgin report on 30 September 2020, Gbagi was declared wanted by the Delta State Police Command over accusation of ordering four of his hotel staff to be stripped naked and physically assaulted, an allegation which his hotel management initially described as \"a malicious conspiracy by some political detractors to bring Gbagi's character to disrepute\". However, the Delta State High Court sitting in Warri later held that Gbagi was culpable of staff abuse and consequently awarded N1 million fine against him. ==Personal life== Gbagi was married to Chief Mrs. Evelyn Gbagi and they were blessed with eight children. Then he married Hon. Justice Sybil Gbagi and had a child. His eldest son is Emuoboh Gbagi, who served as the Special Adviser to former Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa on Youth Development. ==Death and burial== Gbagi died on 4 May 2024 at the age of 62, according to a BBC News Pidgin report. After a brief illness, Gbagi succumbed to death and was survived by his wife Hon. Justice Sybil Gbagi and nine children. The news of Gbagi's death caused several reactions in Nigerian media, with the death being described by the Delta State Government \"as tragic, unfortunate and heart-wrenching\". Gbagi's monarch, the traditional ruler of Ughievwen Kingdom, HRM Matthew Ediri Egbi during a condolence visit to Gbagi's family also described the death as \"a profound loss not only to the family but also to Oginibo, the Urhobo people, Delta State, and Nigeria\". Gbagi was buried on 12 July 2024 in his community Oginibo in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. After his demise, Kenneth Gbagi was remembered by Isaiah Ogedegbe \"as a very benevolent man, one who often put smiles on the faces of his people\". ==Awards and recognition== Gbagi was known around the world as a \"multiple award winning achiever\". He was credited with being \"the first living black man to attain the coveted AKS member of Rotary International and recipient of numerous national and international awards\". Gbagi was also presented with a National Award by former President Muhammadu Buhari, notably receiving the Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) by the Nigerian government in 2022. Traditionally, the chieftaincy title of \"Ojaurhoboreri\" was also conferred on Chief Gbagi because of his love for the Urhobo people. ==Legacy== Kenneth Gbagi's impact in the political arena was seen to have gone \"beyond party politics\". ==References== ==External link== * Official Website Category:1961 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Nigerian politicians Category:Nigerian businesspeople Category:Nigerian lawyers Category:Nigerian philanthropists Category:People from Delta State",
