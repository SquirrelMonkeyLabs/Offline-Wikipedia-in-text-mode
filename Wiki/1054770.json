This is the flag that has always been used by the state government. In 2020, a new movement appeared with a flag that takes the colors of the historical flag of the Republic of Rio Grande, the lion in the center to represent the state of Nuevo León. The state of Nuevo León has not adopted an official flag, but a new state identity flag has emerged. The flag was designed by a student of the UANL, which has had sales through electronic media and sports shops. For to celebrate the 200 years of history of the state of Nuevo León, the Government of the State of Nuevo León, through the Secretariat of Culture, announced an appeal for the adoption of the state anthem and flag, the appeal ended on February 29, 2024. === Historical flags === File:Flag of the Republic of the Rio Grande.svg| Flag of the Republic de Rio Grande (1840) File:Primer bandera de Nuevo León.png| Flag of Nuevo León (1972) File:Flag of Nuevo Leon.svg| Flag of Nuevo León (1998) File:Bandera de Nuevo León.png| Civil flag of Nuevo León (2020) ==Related pages== * List of Mexican flags == References == Nuevo León Category:Nuevo León Utah",
