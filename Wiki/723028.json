 "text": "Sexual consent is consent to engage in sexual activity. Sexual activity without the consent of all people involved is rape, or other sexual assault. However, just because someone appears to have given consent does not make it legal. Some people are considered unable to provide consent, such as children or drunk people. People may also consent to unwanted sexual activity.Quinn- Nilas, C, Goncalves, M, Grant, A, & Kennett, D. (2018).
