The vehicle-ramming attack killed eight people, including five Argentines and one Belgian tourist, and injured eleven others. After leaving the truck, the driver appeared to be wielding two guns and was later shot in the abdomen by police, and then arrested. An ISIS flag and a document that read \"Islamic State will endure forever\" in Arabic were found in the truck.
