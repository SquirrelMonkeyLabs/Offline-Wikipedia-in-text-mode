 "text": "The 1981–82 NHL season was the 65th season of the National Hockey League. Twenty-one teams each played 80 games. The William M. Jennings Trophy made its debut this year as the trophy for the goaltenders from the team with the fewest goals against. The New York Islanders won their third straight Stanley Cup by beating the Vancouver Canucks in four games. Prior to the start of the season, the divisions of the league were re-aligned to better reflect the locations of the teams. The Patrick Division, which had been in the Clarence Campbell Conference, switched to the Prince of Wales Conference, while the Norris Division went the other way, going from the Wales Conference to the Campbell Conference. This divisional alignment existed until the 1993-94 season, at which point both the divisions and the conferences of the league were renamed to reflect geography. ==Regular season== ===Final standings=== Note: GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalties in minutes Note: Teams that qualified for the playoffs are highlighted in bold ====Prince of Wales Conference==== Adams Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Montreal Canadiens 80 46 17 17 109 360 223 1463 Boston Bruins 80 43 27 10 96 323 285 1266 Buffalo Sabres 80 39 26 15 93 307 273 1425 Quebec Nordiques 80 33 31 16 82 356 345 1757 Hartford Whalers 80 21 41 18 60 264 351 1493 Patrick Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM New York Islanders 80 54 16 10 118 385 250 1328 New York Rangers 80 39 27 14 92 316 306 1402 Philadelphia Flyers 80 38 31 11 87 325 313 2493 Pittsburgh Penguins 80 31 36 13 75 310 337 2212 Washington Capitals 80 26 41 13 65 319 338 1932 ====Clarence Campbell Conference==== Norris Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Minnesota North Stars 80 37 23 20 94 346 288 1358 Winnipeg Jets 80 33 33 14 80 319 332 1314 St. Louis Blues 80 32 40 8 72 315 349 1579 Chicago Black Hawks 80 30 38 12 72 332 363 1775 Toronto Maple Leafs 80 20 44 16 56 298 380 1888 Detroit Red Wings 80 21 47 12 54 270 351 1250 Smythe Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Edmonton Oilers 80 48 17 15 111 417 295 1473 Vancouver Canucks 80 30 33 17 77 290 286 1840 Calgary Flames 80 29 34 17 75 334 345 1331 Los Angeles Kings 80 24 41 15 63 314 396 1730 Colorado Rockies 80 18 49 13 49 241 362 1138 ===Scoring leaders=== Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points Player Team GP G A Pts Wayne Gretzky Edmonton Oilers 80 92 120 212 Mike Bossy New York Islanders 80 64 83 147 Peter Stastny Quebec Nordiques 80 46 93 139 Dennis Maruk Washington Capitals 80 60 76 136 Bryan Trottier New York Islanders 80 50 79 129 Denis Savard Chicago Black Hawks 80 32 87 119 Marcel Dionne Los Angeles Kings 78 50 67 117 Bobby Smith Minnesota North Stars 80 43 71 114 Dino Ciccarelli Minnesota North Stars 76 55 51 106 Dave Taylor Los Angeles Kings 78 39 67 106 ==Stanley Cup playoffs== ===Playoff bracket=== ===Finals=== New York Islanders vs. Vancouver Canucks Date Visitors Score Home Score Notes May 8 Vancouver 5 New York 6 OT May 11 Vancouver 4 New York 6 May 13 New York 3 Vancouver 0 May 16 New York 3 Vancouver 1 New York wins the series 4–0. ==NHL awards== Prince of Wales Trophy: New York Islanders Clarence S.
