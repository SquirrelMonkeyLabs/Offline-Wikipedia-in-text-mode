He built organs, clavichords, harpsichords and pianos. In the beginning Stein learned the craft from his father in Heidelsheim. In 1748 to 1749 he was visiting two different workshops: one of Johann Andreas Silbermann in Strasbourg and the other of Frantz Jacob Spath in Regensburg. Later Stein played an important role in the history of piano and was responsible for the design of the Viennese hammer action. In 1777 Stein met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for the first time.The Letter of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1769-1791). In Two Volumes. Vol. 1. By Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
