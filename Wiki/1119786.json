 "text": "The yellow-striped poison frog or yellow-striped poison arrow frog (Dendrobates truncatus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives in wet and dry forests. People have also seen it on banana farms. People have seen this frog between 100 and 1800 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and there are many of them. People used to catch this frog to sell as a pet, but now it is against the law to do that. It is very hard for people to raise this frog in buildings; people have to catch them in the forest. Sometimes these frogs die when people kill drug plant farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
