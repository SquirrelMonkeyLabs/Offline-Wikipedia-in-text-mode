But the deaths of more than 230 ordinary Ugandans ranks as the second-largest cult suicide in recent times.\" Often, these are arranged mass suicides where all (or nearly all) members kill themselves at the same time and place. Mass suicides among members of Heaven's Gate, Order of the Solar Temple, and the Peoples Temple have been called cult suicides. There have also been other cults (like the Filippians ) which supported mass suicide, but did not encourage all of its members to kill themselves. ==References== ==Related pages== * Destructive cult * Doomsday cult * Mass suicide * Puputan ==Other websites== * \"Global charts\" World Health Organisation * \"The Creativity Movement\" ReligiousTolerance.org * \"From Silver Lake to Suicide: One Family's Secret History of the Jonestown Massacre\" by Barry Isaacson Category:Cults",
