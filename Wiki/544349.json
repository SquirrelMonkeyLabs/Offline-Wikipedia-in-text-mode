 "text": "Howard County is a county in the U.S. state of Missouri. Its southern border is the Missouri River. As of the 2020 census, the population was 10,151. Its county seat is Fayette. The county was organized January 23, 1816 and named for Benjamin Howard, the first Governor of the Missouri Territory. ==History== Howard County was settled mainly from the upper Southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. They brought slaves and slaveholding traditions with them and grew hemp and tobacco. Howard was one of several counties settled mainly by Southerners along the Missouri River in the center of the state. Because of this, this area became known as Little Dixie, and Howard County was at its heart. Following the 1848 revolutions in germany, many German immigrants also came to this region. Because of the reliance on slave labor, by 1860 African American slaves made up at least 25 percent of the county's population.T. J. Stiles, Jesse James: The Last Rebel of the Civil War, New York: Vintage Books, 2003, pp.10-11 Many Howard County residents supported the Confederacy during the Civil War. After the end of Reconstruction, Jim Crow laws and racial segregation were enforced in the county. Five African Americans were lynched in Howard County between 1891 and 1914. These were Olli Truxton, Frank Embree, Thomas Hayden, Arthur McNeal, and Dallas Shields.Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States, 1889—1918 (Clark, NJ: Lawbook Exchange, 2012), pp. 80–81 The county continued to be developed for agriculture and is still mostly rural. However, Howard has lost population since reaching its peak in 1900. The mechanization of farming reduced the demand for labor, and many people left for jobs in the cities. In 2000 African-Americans in the county had declined to less than 7 percent of the total. Nearly one-third of the residents now identify themselves as of German ancestry. ==Geography== According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.6%) is water. === Adjacent counties === *Chariton County (northwest) *Randolph County (northeast) *Boone County (southeast) *Cooper County (south) *Saline County (west) === Major highways === *U.S. Route 40 *Route 3 *Route 5 *Route 87 *Route 124 *Route 240 ===National protected area=== *Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge (part) ==Demographics== At the 2020 census, 10,151 people lived in the county.
