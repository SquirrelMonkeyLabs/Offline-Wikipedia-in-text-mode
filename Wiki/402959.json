 "text": "Rosacea is common chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by redness, erythema, telangiectasis, papules or pustules, hyperplasia, or a combination of these manifestations. It gets worse if left untreated. There are four types of rosacea, three involving human skin and the fourth affecting eyes. Rosacea affects approximately 5.46% prevalence in the world's adult population, especially affects mostly Caucasians (northern European descendants) and light-skinned populations. Rosacea affects both males and females. Females are three times more likely than males to get rosacea. It can happen to people of any age. Things that can cause rosacea are several environmental factors like exposure of the face to extreme temperature, the heat of sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol and spicy foods. Also a genetic predisposition with a neurogenic inflammation and the family inheritance are relationated with this condition. Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never officially diagnosed or treated. ==References== Category:Skin problems",
