 "text": "A garage is a place for storing cars. There are many kinds of garages used for different things. ==Residential garage== A residential garage is a garage that is part of a house or similar building. Some garages are directly connected (called \"attached\") to the house, while others are separate and called a \"detached\" garage\". The garage will have a large garage door that opens to let cars in and out, which is often opened by a motor. Standard garage door sizes depend on the size and layout of the garage build blueprint and design. ==Parking garage== A parking garage is a large covered structure, often made of concrete, which is used for holding many cars. Parking garages may have more than one level. ==Automobile repair shop== An automobile repair shop may also be called a garage, although it is for repairing cars rather than just storing them. ==References== Category:Transport buildings and structures Category:Rooms Category:Home",
