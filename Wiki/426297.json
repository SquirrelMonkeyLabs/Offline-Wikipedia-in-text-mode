As a child, she meets a human boy named Stefan, and they both fall in love with each other. King Henry, the ruler of the humans, tries to invade the Moors but Maleficent attacks him. Henry decides that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter Leila. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors and drugs her, but cannot bring himself to kill her. He instead cuts off her wings, presenting them to Henry as \"proof\" of her death. Henry believes him. Stefan marries Leila and becomes king after Henry dies. As revenge, many years later, Maleficent arrives at the christening of Stefan's baby daughter Aurora. She puts a curse on Aurora saying that she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep forever. King Stefan orders three pixies (Knotgrass, Flittle and Thistlewit) to hide and protect Aurora in a forest cottage until her 16th birthday. Over the years, Aurora meets Maleficent several times because she travels into the Moors secretly. Maleficent regrets her curse but cannot undo it. Aurora meets Prince Phillip who is from a nearby kingdom. On the day of her 16th birthdy, the pixies tell Aurora that she is a princess and that Maleficent cursed her. Aurora runs back to Stefan's castle. The curse's power magically draws Aurora to prick her finger and fall into a sleep. Knowing that only love can save her, Maleficent tries to get Prince Phillip to kiss her but it does not work. However, Maleficent's maternal love for Aurora that developed over the years is enough to awake Aurora. King Stefan attacks Maleficent, whose wings return. Stefan tries to tackle Maleficent but she uses her wings to save herself and he falls off a tower and to his death. Aurora is named Queen of both the Moors and the Human Kingdom.
