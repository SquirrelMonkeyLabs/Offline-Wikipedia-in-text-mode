It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees. In 1620 the rich merchant Sir Richard Robartes acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four-sided layout around a central courtyard. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor. During the 18th century the east wing of the house was demolished leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused much damage to the central section. Of the main house only the north wing, with its 29 metre Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, though the original gatehouse also dates back to the mid 17th century. ==References== Category:Villages in Cornwall Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall Category:Buildings and structures in Cornwall",
