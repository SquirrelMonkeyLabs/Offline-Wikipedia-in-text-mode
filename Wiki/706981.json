 "text": "The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or the 1947 UN Partition Plan, was a plan to split British Mandatory Palestine into two different countries, adopted on 29 November 1947. It would have been split into six different regions, three belonging to the Palestinians and three to the Israelis, and Jerusalem would have been an international city shared by both countries. The Israelis accepted the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it. The plan was never put into place and this led to the 1947-1949 Palestine War. == References == Category:1947 establishments in Asia Category:1947 in law Category:Arabâ€“Israeli conflict Category:1940s in Israel Category:20th century in Jordan Category:History of Palestine Category:History of the United Nations",
