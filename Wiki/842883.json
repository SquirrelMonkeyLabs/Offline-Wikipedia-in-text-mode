 "text": "The Hopeless Case (also known as Il caso senza speranza) is a 19th-century painted in oil by Antonio Rotta, in 1871, in Venice, Italy, exhibited at the Walters Art Museum. == History == The painting was finished in August 1871, and is exhibited at Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, in Maryland (United States) of which was the President Vittorio Sgarbi. It is one of the best- known pictorial works in the history of the genre painting movement. The work was purchased for the museum, personally by the president William Thompson Walters (1819â€“1894) in 1878, and exhibited in the permanent collection. It is identified with the catalog number 37182. == Description == A young woman wearing a typical Venetian shawl, she listens to her cobbler, who exposes the desperate condition of her boot. Antonio Rotta interpreted this messy interior with characteristic details of the Venice of the time. The work \"The case without hope\", tells the time when things were repaired, because there was not enough money to buy new ones. Especially the shoes. Wrapped in her colored shawl, the girl is listening to the cobbler's sentence, which decrees that it is impossible to repair that boot once again. For this the painting was initially called \"Without escape\". In the sad gaze, in the tilted head, in the firmly intertwined hands, one feels the full weight of poverty. == Exhibitions == * From Ray to Raphael: The Walters Story, The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, 2014-2016. * A Baltimorean in Paris: George A.
