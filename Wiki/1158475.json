 "text": "The Gupta Empire (around 319–550 CE) was an ancient Indian Hindu empire. It was started by Sri Gupta in the late 3rd century CE, but Chandragupta I is considered the true founder. The empire lasted until 550 CE. The empire declined because of attacks by the Huns, disagreements within the royal family, high taxes, local uprisings, and the weakening of central power. The Gupta emperors commonly used Maharajadhiraja as the royal title. == Family tree == == List of rulers == Ruler Ruler Reign (CE) Notes Sri-Gupta I Founder of the dynasty. Ghatotkacha 280/290–319 CE Second king of Gupta Dynasty Chandra-Gupta I 319–335 CE His title Maharajadhiraja (\"king of great kings\") suggests that he was the first emperor of the dynasty. It is not certain how he turned his small ancestral kingdom into an empire, although a widely accepted theory among modern historians is that his marriage to Licchavi princess Kumaradevi helped him extend his political power. Samudra-Gupta 335–375 CE Defeated several kings of northern India, and annexed their territories to his empire. He also marched along the south-eastern coast of India, advancing as far as the Pallava kingdom. In addition, he subjugated several frontier kingdoms and tribal oligarchies. His empire extended from Ravi River in the west to the Brahmaputra River in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to central India in the south-west; several rulers along the south-eastern coast were his tributaries. Kacha mid 4th century CE Rival brother/king, possibly an usurper, there are coins who attest him as ruler; possibly identical with Samudra-Gupta. Rama-Gupta Chandra-Gupta II Vikramaditya 375–415 CE Continued the expansionist policy of his father Samudragupta: historical evidence suggests that he defeated the Western Kshatrapas, and extended the Gupta empire from the Indus River in the west to the Bengal region in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the Narmada River in the south. Kumara-Gupta I 415–455 CE He seems to have maintained control of his inherited territory, which extended from Gujarat in the west to Bengal region in the east. Skanda-Gupta 455–467 CE It is stated that he restored the fallen fortunes of the Gupta family, which has led to suggestions that during his predecessor's last years, the Empire may have suffered reverses, possibly against the Pushyamitras or the Hunas. He is generally considered the last of the great Gupta Emperors. Puru-Gupta 467–473 CE Kumara-Gupta II Kramaditya 473–476 CE Buddha-Gupta 476–495 CE He had close ties with the rulers of Kannauj and together they sought to run the Alchon Huns (Hunas) out of the fertile plains of Northern India.
