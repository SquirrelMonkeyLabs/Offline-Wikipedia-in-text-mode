 "text": "Sea lions are several pinnipeds from the family Otariidae (eared seals). They live all around the world, except in the Atlantic Ocean. Male sea lions have thick fur around the face and neck, which sometimes looks like a lion's mane. That's how they got the name \"sea lion\". Some, like the Steller sea lion, can actually roar! Of course, these pinnipeds are not really lions at all, but they are mammals. Like lions, they have fur, breathe air, give birth to live young, and feed milk to their young. They also eat meat, though sea lions eat the meat of fishes, squids, and sea birds instead of land animals. Sea lions are also fierce fighters, just like lions. ==Species== The pinniped species called \"sea lion\" are: Wynen L.P. et al 2001.
