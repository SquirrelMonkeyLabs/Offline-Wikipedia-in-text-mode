 "text": "Hyloxalus eleutherodactylus is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog can be as big as 21.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be as big as 22.7 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. The sides of the body are black with some white stripes. Parts of the legs are yellow with brown marks on top and white on the bottom. The belly is yellow in color. The iris of the eye is light copper in color. The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. Scientists saw it near a stream in a rainforest that human beings had changed. Scientists saw this frog in exactly one place, 360 meters above sea level in the Amazon Basin. Scientists saw this frog in a rainforest that had been cut down. ==Young== Scientists believe the female frog lays her eggs on the ground, but they have not seen female Hyloxalus eleutherodactylus frogs laying eggs. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. Scientists saw one male frog with five tadpoles on his back at the same time. At one point in its life, the tadpole can be 3.8–4.3 mm long without the tail and 10.8–11.2 mm long with the tail. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. Because scientists saw the frogs in a rainforest that people had changed, they think this frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
