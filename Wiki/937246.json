 "text": "Lucius Junius Brutus was the founder of the Roman Republic, and one of the first consuls in 509 BC. He was the nephew of the King of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. Brutus had been summoned by the noblewoman Lucretia after she had been raped by the King's son. She believed that the rape defiled her, and she committed suicide by stabbing herself with a knife. It is said that Brutus held the knife, shouting for the overthrow of the Monarchy. ==Revolt== Brutus led a revolt, which resulted in the overthrow of the Monarchy. Brutus then made an oath, that never again will there be a King of Rome. He was elected as the first Consul, along with Lucretia's husband, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. Soon the Royal Family tried to regain the throne, with two of the conspirators being Brutus' two sons. The conspirators were all executed, including his two sons. Collatinus was also removed, with a number of reasons suggested by scholars. ==Death== Tarquinius tried to retake the throne again, and led an army to war. In the Battle of Silvia Arsia, as it was called, both Tarquinius and Brutus stabbed each other, causing their deaths.
