 "text": "Ryan Wesley Routh (born February 18, 1966) is an American man who is accused of attempting to assassinate U.S. president Donald Trump. On September 15, 2024, a Secret Service agent shot at least four rounds at Routh, who was hiding with an SKS-style rifle in bushes at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was trying to point his weapon through the fence line of the golf course, 300â€“500 yards away from the former president, who was moving between holes five and six alongside Republican megadonor and real estate investor Steve Witkoff. Routh fled the scene, but was later arrested as the prime suspect. The update given by the FBI on September 16 mentioned that Routh had not fired his weapon. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:American criminals Category:People from North Carolina",
