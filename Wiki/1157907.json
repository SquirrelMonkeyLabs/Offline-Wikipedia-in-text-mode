 "text": "On 27 December 2024, South Korean prime minister and acting president Han Duck-soo was impeached. This came 10 days after president Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and Han became acting president. Opposition Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae announced plans to impeach Han on 24 December after he failed to support two bills giving special counsel for Yoon and first lady Kim Keon-hee. The motion was formally filed on 26 December after Han blocked the appointment of three justices to the Constitutional Court of Korea whose nomination was approved by the National Assembly. After Speaker Woo Won-shik said that Han can be impeached by a simple majority because of his status as a cabinet minister, Han was impeached by 192 MPs on 27 December, with members of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) boycotting the vote. Han became the first acting president of South Korea to be impeached. Deputy prime minister Choi Sang-mok became acting president until the Constitutional Court's decision on whether to remove Han from office. On 24 March 2025, the Constitutional Court voted to overturn Han's impeachment, reinstating him as acting president and prime minister. ==References== Category:December 2024 events Category:2024 in South Korea Han Duck-soo",
