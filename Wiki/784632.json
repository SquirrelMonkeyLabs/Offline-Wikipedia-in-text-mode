 "text": "The northern snapping frog, giant frog, giant burrowing frog, giant ground frog or Australian water-holding frog (Ranoidea australis) is a frog from northern Australia. It lives in Western Australia and the Northern Territory all the way to Queensland. This frog lives in grasslands and forests where the trees are not too close together. When the weather is rainy, this frog looks for food during the day. When the weather is dry, the frog digs a burrow and stays underground. This frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water, up to 7000 at a time. The tadpoles grow into frogs before the bodies of water dry up, in 30-50 days. The tadpoles can live in water as hot as 43 degrees Celcius. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
