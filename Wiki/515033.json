 "text": "In physics, a neutral particle is a particle with no electric charge. ==Stable or long-lived neutral particles== Long-lived neutral particles do not decay for a very long time. Examples of such particles include photons, neutrons, and neutrinos. ==Other neutral particles== Other neutral particles are very short-lived. They decay before they can be detected by a particle detector. They have been observed only indirectly, such as tracks of ionized particles in a particle accelerator. They include: *Z bosons *Dozens of heavy neutral hadrons: **Neutral mesons such as the pion and kaon **The neutral Delta baryon, and other neutral baryons, such as the xi baryon and lambda baryon == References == * K.
