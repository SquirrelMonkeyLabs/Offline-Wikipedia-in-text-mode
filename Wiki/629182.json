 "text": "Dīs Pater (Latin: “Father of riches”) was a god of the underworld in Roman mythology. Originally a chthonic deity associated with riches and fertility, he became commonly equated with the Greek god Hades alongside the Roman deity Orcus, and so came to be associated with the dark and dismal realm of the dead. The god's name, Dīs Pater, was often shortened to simply Dīs, which came to be used as an alternative name for the underworld, as is the case in Dante's The Divine Comedy, in which the City of Dis comprises Lower Hell.
