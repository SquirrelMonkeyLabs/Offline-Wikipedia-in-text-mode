 "text": "The Chevrolet S-10 Blazer and the similar GMC S-15 Jimmy were mid-size SUVs from General Motors. Production began in 1983.Steve Statham, Jeep (St. Paul, MN:MBI Publishing, 2001), p. 77 The S-10 was produced through 2005. In the United States retail sales after 2004 were limited to two-door Blazer models. All other models were sold to fleets until April 20, 2005. In the Canadian market, four-door models of the Blazer and Jimmy were sold until the 2004 model year. They were sold until the 2005 model year for the two-door models of both. The S-series SUVs were based on the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15 pickup trucks. In 1995 a second-generation model was produced. It had improvements in performance and interior room. It also had updated styling but did not carry the S-10 name. They were produced in Pontiac, Michigan; Linden, New Jersey; Moraine, Ohio; Shreveport, Louisiana; and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Even though production ceased in the U.S., new Blazers are locally produced in Brazil with their own sheet metal stampings). In North America, the Moraine plant produced only 4-door vehicles. Both 2- and 4-door models were produced at Linden, which was the main assembly plant after the switch from Pontiac, Michigan about 1995. == References == S-10 Blazer Category:Sport utility vehicles",
