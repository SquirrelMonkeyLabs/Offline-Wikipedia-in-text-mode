 "text": "The periodic table is a table that puts all known chemical elements in a specific order. Elements that have similar characteristics are often put near each other. In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number of one, hydrogen. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular nucleus of an atom. In the table the elements are arranged into periods and group. A row of elements across the table is called a period. Each period has a number; from 1 to 8. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. Elements in a period have consecutive atomic numbers. A column of elements down the table is called a group. There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table. Each group has a number: from 1 to 18. Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways, according to the number of valency electrons, which gives them similar chemical properties (they behave in similar ways). For example, group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms. There are two systems of group numbers; one using Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3) and the other using Roman numerals (I, II, III). The Roman numeral names were used in most of the 20th century. In 1990 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided to use the new system with Arabic numerals, to replace the two old group systems that used Roman numerals. The periodic table has been used by chemists to observe patterns and relationships between elements. There are 3 main groups in the Periodic Table; metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. For example, elements to the bottom and far left of the table are the most metallic, and elements on the top right are the least metallic. (e.g. caesium is much more metallic than helium). There are also many other patterns and relationships. The periodic table was invented by the Russian chemist Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev (18341907). In his honor, element 101 was named after him, mendelevium. == Standard periodic table == Group → 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Period ↓ 1 1 H Hydrogen 2 He Helium 2 3 Li Lithium 4 Be Beryllium 5 B Boron 6 C Carbon 7 N Nitrogen 8 O Oxygen 9 F Fluorine 10 Ne Neon 3 11 Na Sodium 12 Mg Magnesium 13 Al Aluminium 14 Si Silicon 15 P Phosphorus 16 S Sulfur 17 Cl Chlorine 18 Ar Argon 4 19 K Potassium 20 Ca Calcium 21 Sc Scandium 22 Ti Titanium 23 V Vanadium 24 Cr Chromium 25 Mn Manganese 26 Fe Iron 27 Co Cobalt 28 Ni Nickel 29 Cu Copper 30 Zn Zinc 31 Ga Gallium 32 Ge Germanium 33 As Arsenic 34 Se Selenium 35 Br Bromine 36 Kr Krypton 5 37 Rb Rubidium 38 Sr Strontium 39 Y Yttrium 40 Zr Zirconium 41 Nb Niobium 42 Mo Molybdenum 43 Tc Technetium 44 Ru Ruthenium 45 Rh Rhodium 46 Pd Palladium 47 Ag Silver 48 Cd Cadmium 49 In Indium 50 Sn Tin 51 Sb Antimony 52 Te Tellurium 53 I Iodine 54 Xe Xenon 6 55 Cs Cesium 56 Ba Barium * Lanthanides 72 Hf Hafnium 73 Ta Tantalum 74 W Tungsten 75 Re Rhenium 76 Os Osmium 77 Ir Iridium 78 Pt Platinum 79 Au Gold 80 Hg Mercury 81 Tl Thallium 82 Pb Lead 83 Bi Bismuth 84 Po Polonium 85 At Astatine 86 Rn Radon 7 87 Fr Francium 88 Ra Radium ** Actinides 104 Rf Rutherfordium 105 Db Dubnium 106 Sg Seaborgium 107 Bh Bohrium 108 Hs Hassium 109 Mt Meitnerium 110 Ds Darmstadtium 111 Rg Roentgenium 112 Cn Copernicium 113 Nh Nihonium 114 Fl Flerovium 115 Mc Moscovium 116 Lv Livermorium 117 Ts Tennesine 118 Og Oganesson 8 119 Uue Ununennium 120 Ubn Unbinilium You * Lanthanide Series 57 La Lanthanum 58 Ce Cerium 59 Pr Praseodymium 60 Nd Neodymium 61 Pm Promethium 62 Sm Samarium 63 Eu Europium 64 Gd Gadolinium 65 Tb Terbium 66 Dy Dysprosium 67 Ho Holmium 68 Er Erbium 69 Tm Thulium 70 Yb Ytterbium 71 Lu Lutetium ** Actinide Series 89 Ac Actinium 90 Th Thorium 91 Pa Protactinium 92 U Uranium 93 Np Neptunium 94 Pu Plutonium 95 Am Americium 96 Cm Curium 97 Bk Berkelium 98 Cf Californium 99 Es Einsteinium 100 Fm Fermium 101 Md Mendelevium 102 No Nobelium 103 Lr Lawrencium ;Chemical Series of the Periodic Table * Alkali metals * Alkaline earths * Lanthanides * Actinides * Transition metals * Poor metals * Metalloids/Semi metals/Half metals * Nonmetals * Halogens * Noble gases ;State at standard temperature and pressure.

Other widespread versions are shown below: File:Elementspiral.svg| Theodor Benfey arranged the elements in a spiral, around hydrogen. The atomic weight determines the position of the element. File:Mendeleev flower.jpg|Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev used a flower arrangement; Actinides, Lanthanides are shown as loops beside the main group. File:Periodic system Stowe format.svg|Timothy Stove arranged the elements by quantum number. File:Das Bettermannsche Periodensystem.jpg|Betterman arranged the elements by their isoelectric properties, which can be converted to a polynomial form.
