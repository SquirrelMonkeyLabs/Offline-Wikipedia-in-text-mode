 "text": "The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is an active international temperance organization. It was one of the first organizations of women who wanted social reform. They did this with a program that \"linked the religious and the secular through concerted and far-reaching reform strategies based on applied Christianity.\" It was influential in the temperance movement, and supported the 18th Amendment. It was also influential in social reform issues that became big in the progressive era. The WCTU started on December 23, 1873, in Hillsboro, Ohio. It officially had a national convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1874. ==References== ==Other websites== * World Woman's Christian Temperance Union * Address Before The Second Biennial Convention Of The World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, by Frances Willard, President (October, 1893) * Modern History Sourcebook: Woman's Christian Temperance Union: Growth of Membership and of Local, Auxiliary Unions, 1879-1921 * “We Sang Rock of Ages”: Frances Willard Battles Alcohol in the late 19th century, by Frances Willard * Woman's Christian Temperance Union (Nebraska Chapter) records at the Nebraska State Historical Society * WCTU in Our Heritage * Woman's Christian Temperance Union (Iowa Chapter) records at the Iowa Women's Archives, The University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City * National Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Australia The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in Twentieth-Century Australia *Ruth Tibbits Tooze Papers, 1938-1940, at the Special Collections and Archives Research Center, Oregon State University Libraries Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States",
