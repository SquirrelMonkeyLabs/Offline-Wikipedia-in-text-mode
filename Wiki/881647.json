 "text": "The Paris Club () is a group of officials from major creditor countries. Their role is to find solutions to the payment difficulties of debtor countries. The Paris Club was created gradually from 1956, when the first negotiation between Argentina and its public creditors took place in Paris. The Paris Club treats public claims (that is to say, those due by governments of debtor countries and by the private sector), guaranteed by the public sector to Paris Club members. A similar process occurs for public debt held by private creditors in the London Club, which was organized in 1970 on the model of the Paris Club as an group of banks meet to renegotiate the debt they hold on debtors.
