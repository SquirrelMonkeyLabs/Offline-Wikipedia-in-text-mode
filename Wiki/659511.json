 "text": "Arjuna is one of the characters of the Indian epic Mahabharata. He plays a main role in the Bhagavad Gita alongside Krishna. Arjuna was considered a skilled archer and one of the greatest warrior at their times. He was the third of the Pandava brothers and known as Madhyam Pandava (Middle of Pandavas). He was married to Draupadi, Ulupi, Chitrāngadā and Subhadra (Krishna's and Balarama's sister). His children included Srutakarma, Iravan, Babruvahana , Abhimanyu, Pragati and Pragya. Arjuna was trained in religion, science, administration and military arts by Dronacharya. == Battles fought at Kurukshetra by Krishna == Arjuna was a key Pandava warrior and played a huge role in the Pandava victory in the Kurukshetra war. Lord Hanuman’s image stayed on Arjuna's chariot flag. Some of the crucial battles fought by Arjuna are as follows: * Fall of Bhishma: According to original Mahabharat, Arjuna fairly killed Bhishma on 10th day of the Kurukshetra war by placing an enunch before Bhisma. * Death of Bhagadatta: On the 12th day of the war, Arjuna killed Bhagadatta- the mighty warrior and the King of Pragjyotisha kingdom. * Death of Jayadratha: Arjuna came to know that Jayadratha blocked the other four Pandavas, at entrance of Chakravyuha, due to which Abhimanyu entered alone and was killed unfairly by multiple Kaurava warriors on the 13th day of the war. Arjuna vowed to kill him the very next day before sunset, failing which he would kill himself by jumping in a fire. The Kauravas hid Jayadratha from Arjuna in a formation, knowing that Arjuna's death would result in a Kaurava victory. Arjuna defeated all protectors of Jaydratha including Karna, Drona, Kripa and Ashwatthama and killed Jayadratha. Jayadratha had a boon from his father that whoever would be responsible for his head falling to the ground would have his own head blown up. So, Arjuna beheaded Jayadratha with an arrow that carried his head to the lap of his father, who was awoken from his meditation and ended up dropping the head to the ground, thus resulting in the explosion of his own head.Kisori Mohan Ganguly translation of Mahabharat P-321 Drona Parv, Chapter 146 * Killing of the Trigartas: On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed all the Trigartas. * Killing of Samsaptakas: On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed all the Samsaptakas. * Killing Susharma: On the 17th day of the war, Arjuna killed Susharma- the ruler of Trigartas. * Killing Vrishasena: Arjuna killed Vrishasena on 17th day of war. Arjuna gave the challenge to Karna to save his son and attacked Vrishasena fiercely and fired 4 razor headed arrows, cutting off Vrishasena's bow, his two arms and then his head infront of Karna, who failed to protect his son. * Death of Karna: The much anticipated battle between Arjuna and Karna took place on the 17th day of war. The battle continued fiercely and Arjuna killed Karna using Anjalikastra. == References == Category:Mahabharata Category:Hindu gods and goddesses",
