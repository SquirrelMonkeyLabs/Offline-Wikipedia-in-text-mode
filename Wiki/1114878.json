 "text": "Abdul Rahman Arif al-Bayraktar (; April 14, 1916 â€“ August 24, 2007) was an Iraqi politician and Military officer. He was the President of Iraq from April 1966 to July 1968. He came to power following the death of his brother, President Abdul Salam Arif. He was deposed in a bloodless coup by the Ba'ath Party. ==Early life and education== Abdul Rahman Arif was born on April 14, 1916, in Baghdad, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He was part of a prominent Iraqi family of Turkish origin. He completed his early education in Baghdad before entering the Royal Military Academy in 1936, where he graduated as a second lieutenant. ==Military career== Arif steadily rose through the ranks of the Iraqi military. He participated in the Anglo-Iraqi War in 1941. Later he held various command positions. By the 1960s, he had become a significant figure within the Iraqi military establishment. ==Political career== ===Presidency of Abdul Salam Arif=== Abdul Rahman Arif's political career was closely linked to his brother, Abdul Salam Arif, who seized power in a coup in 1963. During his brother's presidency, Abdul Rahman held various positions, including that of the Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Army. ===Presidency (1966-1968)=== ===Ascension to Power=== Following the sudden death of Abdul Salam Arif in a helicopter crash on April 13, 1966, Abdul Rahman Arif was chosen as president by the Iraqi military. His presidency was marked by attempts to continue his brother's policies, which aimed at modernizing Iraq and balancing relations with both the Eastern and Western blocs during the Cold War. ===Domestic and foreign policy=== Arif's government maintained a stance of Arab nationalism. It wanted closer ties with other Arab countries, particularly Egypt. Domestically, he faced numerous challenges, including political instability and economic difficulties. ===Overthrow=== On July 17, 1968, Abdul Rahman Arif was overthrown in a bloodless coup led by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. The coup was organized by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein. This was the beginning of Ba'athist rule in Iraq. Arif was subsequently sent into exile. ==Later life and death== Following his overthrow, Abdul Rahman Arif lived in exile, primarily in Turkey and later in Jordan. He returned to Iraq briefly in the 1980s but left again as the political situation got worse. He lived a quiet life away from politics until his death on August 24, 2007, in Amman, Jordan. ==Legacy== Abdul Rahman Arif's presidency is often overshadowed by the tumultuous events that followed his overthrow and the rise of Saddam Hussein. However, his brief time is noted for its continuation of his brother's policies and the relatively peaceful manner in which power was transferred in 1968. ==Personal life== Abdul Rahman Arif was married and had several children. He was known for his modesty and dedication to his family. His personal interests included reading and military history. ==References== * \"Abdul Rahman Arif.\" Encyclopaedia Britannica, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. *Marr, Phebe. *The Modern History of Iraq*.
