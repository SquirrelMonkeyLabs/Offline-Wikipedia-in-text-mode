Tholen Discovered on May 24, 1981 Orbital characteristics Epoch 18 August 1989 Semi-major axis 73 548 ± 1 km Eccentricity 0.001393 ± 0.00008 Orbital period 0.55465332 ± 0.00000001 d Inclination 0.251 ± 0.009° (to Neptune equator) 0.205° (to local Laplace plane) Is a moon of Neptune Physical characteristics Dimensions 216×204×164 km (± ~10 km) Mass ~4.2 kg (estimate) Mean density ~1.2 g/cm3 (estimate) Rotation period assumed synchronous Axial tilt ~zero presumably Albedo (geometric) 0.09 Surface temp. ~51 K mean (estimate) Atmosphere none Larissa or Neptune VII, is the fifth closest moon to Neptune. It is named after Larissa, a lover of Poseidon (Neptune) in Greek mythology. It was first found by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and David J. Tholen based on ground-based stellar occultation observations on May 24, 1981, and given the designation S/1981 N 1 and said on 29 May 1981. The moon was refound and confirmed to be the only object in its orbit during the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989 after which it received another designation S/1989 N 2 on August 2, 1989. Larissa is not a sphere and appears to be cratered a lot, with no sign of any geological changes. Little else is known about it. ==Other websites== * Larissa Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration Category:Neptune's moons",
