 "text": "According to Islam, Yam, son of Noah was the fourth son of Noah. Yam is not in the Jewish holy book, the Torah, or the Christian holy book, the Bible. Those two books talk about Yam's older brothers, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, but Yam is only in the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an. In the Muslim version of the story of the Great Flood, Yam did not believe in God the way his father, mother and brothers did. They followed God's instructions and Noah built a large boat, the ark, in time to survive the flood, but Yam drowned instead. According to the Qur'an, Noah asked Yam to come with him on the boat, but Yam decided to climb a mountain instead: \"O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers.\" Canaan said, \"I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.\" Noah said, \"There is no protector today from the decree of The Lord our God, except from whom He gives mercy.\" Then it is mentioned that Yam drowned. ==Other versions of Canaan== The holy books of the Jews, Christians and Muslims also talk about Canaan (son of Ham), Noah's grandson. This Canaan is still alive after the flood. One Jewish scholar thinks this Canaan might have been Noah's son and not grandson. So this could be the same Canaan or it could be another person with the same name.̣̪ ==References== Category:Quranic figures",
