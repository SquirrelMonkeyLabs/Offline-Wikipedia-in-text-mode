It was the coast of North Africa â€“ what is now Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. This area was used by Arab and Berber pirates. They attacked ships and coastal towns. They stole goods and people from Europe, America and sub-Saharan Africa and sold them in the Barbary slave trade. ==References== Category:Geography of Africa",
