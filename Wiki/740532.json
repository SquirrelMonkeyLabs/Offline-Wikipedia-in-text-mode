 "text": "4K resolution talks about a horizontal display resolution of about 4,000 pixels. Digital television and digital cinematography commonly use several different 4K resolutions. In television and consumer media, 3840x2160 (4K UHD) is a common 4K standard. The movie projection industry uses 4096x2160 (DCI 4K). The 4K used for iMac's display is 4096 x 2304 px. 4K is generally considered to be the upgrade to 1080p (1920x1080). The advantages of 4K are that the display has four times more pixels than 1080p which allows the picture to be clearer. ==References== Category:Display technology Category:Movie terminology",
