 "text": "Affiliate marketing is creating content that recommends specific products with a shared revenue business model. Affiliate marketing is a relationship between three key players: The Merchant or Advertiser, The Affiliate or Publisher and The Consumer or Audience. The creators place affiliate links in the content. Usually, the pay is based on the commission for the products sold. Most of the big brands are happy to use this type of marketing, directly by the company itself or through 3rd party affiliate networks. It is a very effective form of advertising. Content recipients are often more likely to buy when clicking a link in comments from their favorite creators. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Marketing",
