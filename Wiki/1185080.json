 "text": "Screw theory is a Mathematical formulation of vector pairs used in physics (dynamics of rigid bodies. Screws are fasteners which twist and move up and down a screw hole because of helical riveting. We can express this movement in terms of vectors and understand many aspects of how far the screw has turned, gone in or out, etc. from the manipulation of mathematical operations on screws. We usually deal with multiplication of matrices in screw theory. == See also == * Screw axis * Newtonâ€“Euler equations uses screws to describe rigid body motions and loading. * Twist (differential geometry) * Twist (rational trigonometry) Category:Mathematics",
