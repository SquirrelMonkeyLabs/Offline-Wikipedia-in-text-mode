 "text": "The theory of complexity classifies problems based on how difficult they are to solve. Complexity in mathematics means the level of maturity and time needed to arrive to a correct solution. A way to assign the complexity of a problem is to see if the number of steps needed to solve it is bounded by some power of the problem's size.
