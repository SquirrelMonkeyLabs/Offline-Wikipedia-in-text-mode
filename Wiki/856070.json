 "text": "Baṅgamātā (), Mother Bengal or simply Bangla, a personification of Bengal, In Amar Shonar Bangla, the national anthem of Bangladesh, Rabindranath Tagore used the word \"Maa\" (Mother) numerous times to refer to the motherland, i.e. Bengal. Despite her popularity in patriotic songs and poems, her physical representations and images are rare. However, Muslims of Muslim majority Bangladesh, specially the Bangladeshi nationalists, revere a similar personification of Bangladesh as Bangamata (the \"Mother Bangladesh\"), though it is not as a goddess but an abstract reference to the motherland. == In art and literature == In his patriotic song, known as Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy (1905), the poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote the following depiction of Bangladesh: :When did you come out of the heart of Bangladesh, :O, Mother dear, with such inexplicable splendour! :It’s impossible to take away eyes from you! :The doors of your golden temple have unlocked. :Your right hand holds the blazing sword, the left one takes away fear, :Smile of affection on the eyes, the third eye glaring. :O Mother dear, how uniquely you reveal yourself! :The cloud of your untied hair conceals thunders :Ends of your sunlight coloured robes flutter in the horizon! :It’s impossible to take away eyes from you! :The doors of your golden temple have unlocked. :When impassionately did not look up seemed :Poor mother stayed back home , desolate, destitute. :Your torn clothes vanish now, meagre smile disappear. :Beams of light scatter from your feet into entire sky :O Mother, your appearance astounds me. :You flood the world with the flow of happiness on the distressed nights :O the mindblower, your word of fearlessness drum the heart :It’s impossible to take away eyes from you! :The doors of your golden temple have unlocked. This is most probably only picturesque details of Mother Bengal. ==References== Category:National personifications",
