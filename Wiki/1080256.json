 "text": "The Cat Ba shrub frog (Philautus catbaensis) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam. People have seen it on Cat Ba Island in Cat Ba National Park, which is from 0 to 300 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog could be dead soon because it lives in such a small place and because people are still cutting down the forests where it lives to make farms. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
