 "text": "The Pig War was a border dispute in 1859 between the U.S and Great Britain over the San Juan Island on the U.S-British border. This island is occupied by both British and American citizens. In 1859, a pig owned by a British employee of Charles Griffin got onto the farm of an American farmer named Lyman Cutlar. The pig fed on Lyman's potatoes and this made him kill the pig.This started a land dispute between the two countries and almost caused another war as tension rose. ==References== Category:19th century in Canada Category:1859 in the United States Category:1850s in the United Kingdom",
