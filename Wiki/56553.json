Examples are: 1\\. groups of digits repeating forever, for example, :\\frac{1}{3} = 0.333333\\dots = 0.\\overline{3} 2\\. fractions :\\frac{500}{10 \\times 10} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5 3\\. radicals (in the following example the quantity ab+2 is the radicand, and thus has a vinculum over it): :\\sqrt[n]{ab+2} == Other websites == *MathWorld Vinculum Entry with further (more complicated) examples *Periodic Continued Fraction Category:Mathematical notation",
