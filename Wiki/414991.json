 "text": "The Tappan Zee Bridge is a bridge in the Hudson Valley region of New York. It is three miles long. It goes across the Hudson River. It connects Westchester and Rockland Counties. The bridge opened in 1955. It took traffic from other bridges and ferries in the area. The bridge is about north of New York City. The city can be seen from the bridge on a clear day. The bridge carries seven lanes of the New York State Thruway. The bridge is named for a Native American tribe from the area called the \"Tappan\". Zee is the Dutch word for \"sea\", as the bridge crosses water. At the beginning of the 21st century the bridge was old and too small for the traffic. People in the region argued for years for a new bridge, which replaced the old one in 2017. The old bridge was demolished in January 2019. == Construction of new bridge == In 2013, the New York State Thruway Authority began building the New Tappan Zee Bridge. It will be a double-span bridge (four lanes per span in opposite directions) with designated bus lanes.The new bridge opened to traffic on August 26, 2017 for the westbound/northbound span. The eastbound/southbound span opened on September 11, 2018. The new span carries 10 lanes (4 lanes and with a bus lane in each direction) along with 2 pedestrian/bicycle lanes. An October 14, 2012, Newsday article reports the Tappan Zee Bridge has been referred to as the Golden Gate Bridge of the East because of many suicide jumpers. The article says \"The new Tappan Zee, which is in the works, will include fencing designed to thwart jumpers.\" == References == Category:Bridges in New York (state) Category:Cantilever bridges Category:Steel bridges",
