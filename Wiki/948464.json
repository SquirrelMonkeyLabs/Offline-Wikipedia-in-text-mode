 "text": "The Montaukett or Montauk are Native American people from Long Island, New York. They are part of the Algonquian-language group. They are also part of the Northeastern Woodlands. They are related to the Pequot and Narragansett peoples. Montauketts were allied with the settlers during the Pequot War. Colonization spread disease and made the population smaller. Montauk descendants live in Wisconsin and the Shinnecock Reservation in New York. The US Government has not recognized any tribes of the Montauk. ==References== Category:Native Americans",
