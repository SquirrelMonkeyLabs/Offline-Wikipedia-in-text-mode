Wind power capacity has expanded quickly to 336 GW in June 2014, and wind energy production was about 4% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing fast. Wind power is widely used in Europe, and more recently in the United States and Asia.Global wind energy markets continue to boom – 2006 another record year (PDF).Global Wind Energy Council (2009). Global Wind 2008 Report , p. 9, accessed on January 4, 2010. Wind power accounts for approximately 19% of electricity generation in Denmark, 11% in Spain and Portugal, and 9% in the Republic of Ireland.International Energy Agency (2009). IEA Wind Energy: Annual Report 2008 p. 9. ==Operational wind farms== Many of the largest onshore wind farms are in the USA.
