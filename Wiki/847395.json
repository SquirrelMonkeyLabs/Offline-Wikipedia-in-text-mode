 "text": "Poleyembryony is when one fertilized egg becomes more than one embryo. Animals and plants can both do polyembryony. Most mammals can have twins or triplets, but this is not what usually happens. It happens more often in other living things, for example citrus trees, parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms and various aquatic invertebrates. ==References== Category:Cell biology Category:Reproductive system",
