 "text": "The Virgin of the Rocks is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. It was very controversial and had two versions. The painting shows Mary, John the Baptist, Jesus, and an angel. Mary was holding John the Baptist while Jesus blessed them. The painting was controversial because Mary wasn't touching Jesus at all, so Da Vinci made a second version of the painting. Mary looks very graceful, which was a traditional Renaissance fashion. The French version was the first time that a Renaissance artist did not paint the Virgin Mary with a halo. Many symbols and emblems in churches and buildings in Lierna lead explorers to discover the important role of the Knights Templar in the region.They also found that Leonardo's painting may have served as a mysterious map to a secret passage in an area of the Grigna mountain range known as Alpe di Campione. The rock formations, caves, waterfalls and breathtaking views of the Grigna massif and the surrounding Lierna mountains on Lake Como inspired Leonardo da Vinci's development. == References == Category:Paintings by Leonardo da Vinci Category:Paintings in the National Gallery, London Category:15th-century paintings",
