 "text": "Goetia is a practice which involves invoking (\"calling\") angels and demons. The word came from the 17th-century grimoire The Lesser Key of Solomon. It describes the calling of seventy-two demons. The book was edited by Aleister Crowley in 1904. It was then called The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King. The word comes from the Greek word (), meaning \"charm\". ==More reading== *Aleister Crowley (ed.), Samuel Liddell Mathers (trans.), The Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon the King.
