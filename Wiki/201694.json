He was discovered by his manager Scooter Braun from his YouTube videos in 2008. == Early life and career == He was born on March 1, 1994. Justin Bieber grew up in Ontario. When he was twelve years old, he went into a local singing contest. He came in third place. The video of the contest was uploaded to his YouTube channel run by his mother Pattie Mallette. Bieber was noticed by famous music industry manager Scott Samuel \"Scooter\" Braun. Braun saw the 12-year-old boy on YouTube singing a song by Ne-Yo. Braun contacted Bieber's mother, Pattie Mallette, who agreed to bring her son, who was 14 years old at that time, to Atlanta to try working together. Braun convinced them to move from Canada to the United States. After seeing more success, Braun presented Bieber to two successful artists, Usher and Justin Timberlake. Both showed interest. Eventually Usher's mentor, music executive L. A. Reid, signed Bieber to a deal with Island Def Jam. In 2009, Bieber toured with Iyaz and Taylor Swift and traveled in the United States. His first EP, My World, which was released in that year, features four singles, \"One Time\", \"One Less Lonely Girl\", \"Favorite Girl\", and \"Love Me\". He signed to a record deal with Usher. He released My World 2.0 in March 2010 as his debut studio album, as well as going on a world tour. The album includes his smash hit single \"Baby\" featuring Ludacris, a remix version of \"Somebody to Love\" featuring his mentor Usher, and two promotional singles \"U Smile\", and \"Never Let You Go\". In the same year, he released My Worlds Acoustic, which includes acoustic versions of his songs from the My World album, and it also contains the ballad song \"Pray\". Purpose's single \"Sorry\" is his most popular song. Bieber has released a book called Justin Bieber: First Step 2 Forever: My Story. In late 2011, he made his professional acting debut in the biopic 3D concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, the movie is accompanied with the release of his remix album Justin Bieber: Never Say Never - The Remixes, which includes remix versions of songs from his previous albums, collaborations with other recording artists and a brand-new track is also included. The remix album includes the single \"Never Say Never\" a duet song with singer and actor Jaden Smith in which it serves as the theme song for the 2010 movie The Karate Kid.

In 2013, he released Believe Acoustic, containing acoustic versions of songs from the album Believe and three new songs. On December 23, 2013, the album Journals was released. It has fifteen songs. Ten have been released as singles. The album Purpose came out in late 2015. It includes the singles \"Sorry\", \"Love Yourself\", and \"Company\". Earlier in the year, he was arrested for being reckless. The album was supported by the Purpose World Tour, which began in 2016, became his highest-grossing world concert tour ever. In early 2017, he was featured in a remix version of Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's song \"Despacito\", in which Bieber sings in Spanish for the first time. In July 2017, Bieber cancelled the remaining dates of his tour due to \"unforeseen circumstances\". On February 14, 2020, the singer released his fifth studio album, Changes, it contains the singles \"Yummy\" and \"Intentions\" featuring rapper Quavo.

He released his single \"Anyone\", on January 1, 2021. On March 5, he has released his latest song titled \"Hold on\". All of these songs were featured on his sixth studio album Justice, released on March 19, 2021. The Justice World Tour (previously known as the Changes Tour) was set to begin in 2020, but due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was postponed in 2021 and later to 2022. The tour officially began on February 18, 2022, in San Diego and was scheduled to end on March 25, 2023, in Kraków. However, the tour ended in Rio de Janeiro on September 4, 2022, due to Bieber prioritizing his health, after 49 shows in three continents. ==Personal life== Justin Bieber is a Christian. He has a younger brother and sister. His parents never married each other. Originally from Canada, he now lives in the United States. On January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami, Florida, for drunk driving, resisting arrest and driving with an expired driver's license. Late 2013 and most of 2014 was a difficult time for Bieber because Scooter, Bieber's manager, was focused on his new client, Ariana Grande. ===Relationships=== Bieber dated singer and actress Selena Gomez from 2011 to 2012, and on and off from 2013 to 2014. Even though he said in an interview in 2014 that he and Gomez were officially together once again, they broke up again. Bieber got engaged to Hailey Baldwin on July 7, 2018. They got married in a private courthouse in September 2018, but then got married in Bluffton, South Carolina in September 2019. On August 23, 2024, they had a son named Jack Blues. ===Illness=== Bieber has revealed that he has currently been dealing with several mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. However, during an interview, he said he had contracted Lyme disease and other health problems. In June 2022, Bieber announced that he had Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 and this had caused half of his face to become paralyzed. Due to his paralysis, he was unable to perform and he had to cancel and postpone dates on his Justice World Tour. He also had to postpone dates for the tour earlier after testing positive for COVID-19 twice. The tour would eventually be cancelled because of the severity of Bieber's Ramsay Hunt disease. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * My World 2.0 (2010) * Under the Mistletoe (2011) * Believe (2012) * Purpose (2015) * Changes (2020) * Justice (2021) == Tracklist for his collaborative album: JB Music == * 1.
