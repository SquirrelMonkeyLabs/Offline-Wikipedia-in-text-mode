She asked to be body searched instead. After being taken to a bag checking area, a woman was sent to search her and then she blew up her suicide bomb. Two IDF soldiers, one Israeli policeman, and a Israeli worker at the facility were killed. 7 other Israelis and 4 Palestinians were injured. === Killed === * Reem Riyashi, mother from Gaza City. * 20 year old IDF soldier Tzur Or from Rishon Lezion * 19 year old policeman Andrei Kegeles from Nahariya * 29 year old worker Gal Shapira from Ashkelon * 22 year old IDF soldier Vladimir Trostinsky from Rehovot == References == Category:Palestinian militants Category:2004 deaths Category:1982 births Category:People from the Gaza Strip Category:Hamas allies Category:Suicide bombers",
