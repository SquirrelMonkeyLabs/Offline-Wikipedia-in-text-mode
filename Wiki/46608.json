 "text": "Pyrotechnics is often thought to be synonymous with the manufacture of fireworks, but it also includes items for military and industrial uses. Items such as safety matches, oxygen candles, explosive bolts and fasteners and the automobile safety airbag all fall under pyrotechnics. Without pyrotechnics, modern aviation and spaceflight would be impracticable. This is because pyrotechnic devices combine high reliability with very compact and efficient energy storage. A pyrotechnic show is a pre-planned complex that includes ground and high-altitude fireworks. Sometimes such events are accompanied by the performance of specially trained artists of the original genre with pyrotechnic equipment. == Other websites == * Pyrotechnics FAQ * The Pyrotechnics Guild International * A guide on pyrotechics * A basic Pyrotechnics Site == References ==",
