 "text": "Leucostethus ramirezi is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog on farms and in places where humans' animals eat grass but only where there were clean streams and forests nearby. They saw it near forests but not in forests. Scientists saw it between 1300 and 2160 meters above sea level. Scientists saw this frog in Parque Nacional Natural Las Orquídeas. They think it could also live in Parque Nacional Natural Paramillo. ==Young== Scientists saw tadpoles swimming in small pools of water. They saw the tadpoles swimming in footprints. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. They think it can live in places that human beings have changed a little but not in places that human beings have changed a lot. The frog is in danger because people cut down forests where it lives to make farms, make places for animals to eat grass, and to dig for gold even though digging for gold in these places is against Colombia's laws. People even cut down trees in Parque Nacional Natural Las Orquídeas. Scientists do not know whether the fungal disease chytridiomycosis is killing this frog or not. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
