Scientists think it may live in China. ==Body== The adult frog is about 33.8 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog is soft yellow- brown in color with black stripes. There is some lavendar color on the tops of the legs. ==Home== This frog lives in forests on hills that have evergreen trees and bamboo in them. People have only seen it in forests. People have seen the frogs on plants about 1 meter above the ground. People have seen this frog between 20 and 600 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole because that is what other frogs in Theloderma do. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. People cut down forests to make farms. This frog lives in at least two protected parks: Phou Dendin National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Muong Nhe Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
