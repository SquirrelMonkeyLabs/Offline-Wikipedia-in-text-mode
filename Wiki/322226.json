 "text": "The United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal was a major political scandal in the United Kingdom. It was caused by leaked expense claims made by members of the United Kingdom Parliament over several years. The Daily Telegraph leaked the claims in 2009. The claims showed that MPs had misused the expenses system to gain money. This made the British public very angry. The scandal made lots of MPs leave or be sacked, and it made them apologise and pay money back. Some people were prosecuted and put in prison.
