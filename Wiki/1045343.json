 "text": "The Portugal women's national football team plays football for Portugal in international competitions for women. The team is managed by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) and takes part in tournaments like the FIFA Women's World Cup, UEFA Women's Euro, the Summer Olympics, and the Algarve Cup. In the past, the Portuguese women's team was not very good compared to other teams in Western Europe. But in recent years, they have improved a lot. They even got to play in the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017. In 2023, they qualified for the World Cup for the first time. They were in a tough group with the United States, the Netherlands, and Vietnam. They played well and even won a match against Vietnam, which was a big moment for them. But in the end, they didn't make it to the next round because they drew their last match against the United States. So, they finished 3rd in their group, but it was still a good achievement for them. == References == Category:European women's national association football teams Category:Football in Portugal Category:National sports teams of Portugal",
