 "text": "Originalism is a judicial philosophy that interprets the Constitution based on its original meaning at the time it was adopted. Originalists believe that the Constitution has a fixed meaning and should not be altered by modern interpretations unless formally amended.

Notable originalist judges include Antonin Scalia and Hugo Black, who advocated for strict adherence to the Constitution's original intent",
