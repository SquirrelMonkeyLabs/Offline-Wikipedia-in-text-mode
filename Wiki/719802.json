 "text": "Nyamuragira is a shield volcano in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The name means Herd of Cows. It is among the most active volcanoes in Africa. This is an active shield volcano found in the Virunga mountains in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), about 25 kilometers North of Lake Kivu in Nord-Kivu Province. It is one Africa’s active volcanoes which is believed to have erupted almost 40times since 1885. It is 13 kilometers North West of Nyiragongo and this volcano is believed to have caused extensive damage to Goma city during the 2002 eruption. Nyamuragira is 500 cubic kilometers and covers 1,500 square kilometers. Recent eruptions are believed to have happened in 2010, 2011 and 23 May 2021. Large portions of sulfur dioxide released in the atmosphere by volcanoes are as a result of the Nyiragongo volcano. The broad shield volcano is 3058meters high and about 2 kilometers wide and during volcanic eruptions, a lava lake is contained within the calderas. It is believed that on 6th November 2011, an eruption started from a series of aligned fissures about 10 kilometers East of the summit caldera and this started with intense ground fracturing and tall lava fountains from several vents that started to build the Western cone complex Kimanura. Mount Nyamuragira or Nyamulagira derives its name from the Rwandan verb ‘Kuragika inka’ meaning herd of cows and Inka meaning cows. Mount Nyamuragira is visited by most tourists because of its strategic location with the volcanic craters on the top. Also due to the presence of tree species that grow on the fertile soils in the surroundings. This is also a true birding destination for different bird species that nest in the neighboring trees. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Geography of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Volcanoes of Africa",
