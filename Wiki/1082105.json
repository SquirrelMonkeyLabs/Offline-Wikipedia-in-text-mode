 "text": "Old Dan's Records is Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot's eighth studio album. It was released in 1972 on the Reprise Records label. The album reached #1 in Canada on the RPM national album chart on November 5, 1972, and remained there for three weeks. In the U.S., it peaked at #95 on the pop chart. The album presents a continued change in Lightfoot's sound as he begins to add country influences to his standard folk sound. He used banjo, dobro and steel guitar. Lightfoot continued to use these country influences in his music until the early 1980s. Despite its 1972 year of its first release, the album was nominated for 1974 Juno Award for \"Folk Album of the Year\" and it won that award. Lightfoot also won a Juno that year as \"Folk Singer of the Year\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Gordon Lightfoot. ===Side 1=== # \"Farewell to Annabel\" – 2:59 # \"That Same Old Obsession\" – 3:46 # \"Old Dan's Records\" – 3:05 # \"Lazy Mornin'\" – 3:43 # \"You Are What I Am\" – 2:37 ===Side 2=== # \"Can't Depend on Love\" – 3:12 # \"My Pony Won't Go\" – 3:50 # \"It's Worth Believin'\" – 3:24 # \"Mother of a Miner's Child\" – 3:18 # \"Hi'way Songs\" – 3:37 ==Personnel== * Gordon Lightfoot - vocals, guitar, vibraphone * Red Shea - lead guitar, classical guitar, Dobro * Terry Clements - lead guitar * Rick Haynes - bass * Barry Keane - drums, percussion * Dave Brown - percussion * Bruce Good - autoharp * Larry Good - 5-string banjo * David Bromberg - slide Dobro (\"My Pony Won't Go\") * Nick De Caro - piano, orchestral arrangements * Ollie Strong - steel guitar ;Technical *Lee Herschberg - engineer *Ed Thrasher - art direction *John Reeves - photography \"Special thanks to Bill Richards and Guido Basso and members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra\" == References == Category:Folk albums",
