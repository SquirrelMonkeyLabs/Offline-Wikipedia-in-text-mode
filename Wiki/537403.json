 "text": "The Sneaker Pimps are a British trip hop group. They formed in Hartlepool, England in 1994. They are best known for their songs \"6 Underground\" and \"Spin Spin Sugar\". Their song, \"6 Underground\", went to #7 on Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The band's founding members were Liam Howe and Chris Corner. They then hired Kelli Dayton as a singer, and longtime friend Ian Pickering to write lyrics. Dayton was the original singer of the Sneaker Pimps. After the first album, the band felt that demos for the 1999 album Splinter was better for the voice of Corner. Following the tour for their first album, Becoming X, they kicked Dayton out of the group. Dayton later had a solo career under the name \"Kelli Ali\". The Sneaker Pimps broke up in 2005. They got back together in 2015. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:1994 establishments in England Category:1990s British music groups Category:2000s British music groups Category:2010s British music groups Category:English pop music groups Category:Hartlepool Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Trip hop groups Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2005 Category:2005 disestablishments in England Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2010s establishments in England",
