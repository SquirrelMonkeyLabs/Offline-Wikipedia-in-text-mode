 "text": "Ashley Shandrel Luther (April 15, 1988 â€“ March 1, 2019), better known as Elly Mayday, was a Canadian model and activist for women's health. She was known for battling ovarian cancer throughout her modeling career. She was photographed with surgical scars and a bald head from chemotherapy. In 2013, she was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer only seen in elderly women. She was originally called a plus-size model by industry standards, a label which she rejected, saying that she embraced her size 14 body, and was normal size. She was on the front a campaign for the Australian Women's Weekly and was one of six models featured in plus-size lingerie company Lane Bryant's #ImNoAngel campaign in April 2015. Her unretouched surgery scars were visible in the photographs. Mayday died from the disease on March 1, 2019 at a hospital in Vancouver, aged 30. ==References== Category:1988 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from ovarian cancer Category:Canadian models Category:Canadian activists Category:People from Saskatchewan Category:People from Vancouver",
