 "text": "Suppiluliuma II, the son of Tudhaliya IV, was the last known king of the New Kingdom of the Hittite Empire, ruling 1207 BCE – c.1178 BCE, contemporary with Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyira. He is known from two inscriptions in hieroglyphics. They record wars against former vassal Tarhuntassa, and against Alasiya in Cyprus. After the fall, the Kaskians were probably in control of Hatti. Hattusa itself was destroyed, its site only re-occupied by a Phrygian fortress some 500 years later. ==Literature== *Astour, AJA 69 (1965). *Güterbock, JNES 26 (1967), 73–81. ==Other websites== *Reign of Suppiluliuma II Category:Hittite Empire Category:13th century BC Category:12th century BC Category:2nd-millennium BC people",
