They were more focused on action than the plot. They became popular in 1943 when Akira Kurosawa made the movie Sugata Sanshiro about a young man who has to learn judo. In 1945, Kurosawa made a sequel which was the first movie ever to have karate in it. In the 1970s, kung fu movies made by studios in Hong Kong like the Shaw Brothers Studio and Godfrey Hoâ€™s studio were translated into English and were watched in the United States and Canada. ==Animated movies== There are some animated films that are about martial arts like the Kung Fu Panda franchise from DreamWorks Animation, which consists of four movies: Kung Fu Panda (2008), Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011), Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) and Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024). == References ==",
