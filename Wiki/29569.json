 "text": "Chaos was the nothingness at the beginning of the world, described in the creation myths of Classical mythology. It was the state the universe (or cosmos) was in before it was created. Because early Christians did not understand how to use the word \"chaos\" properly, the word's meaning changed to \"disorder\" or random and not normal. It is the opposite of order. Chaos is often identified as a god, who filled the gap between Heaven and Earth. Born out of chaos were the first beings: *Gaia, the Earth *Tartarus, the Underworld *Uranus, Sky *Nyx, the Night *Erebos, the Darkness of the Underworld ==References== Category:Greek mythology Category:Creation myths",
