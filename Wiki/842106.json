However, a competitor, I Can't Believe it's Yogurt, forced TCBY to change its name from its initials. TCBY picked \"The Country's Best Yogurt\". TCBY offers frozen yogurt in a variety of flavors. These flavors include Chocolate, White Chocolate Mousse and Golden Vanilla. TCBY also offers drinks, including smoothes and Frappe Chillers. == References == Category:American restaurants Category:1981 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in Colorado",
