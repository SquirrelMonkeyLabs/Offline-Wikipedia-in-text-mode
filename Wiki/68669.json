The city's area is 155.54 km² (60 square miles). In 2005, 103,005 people lived there. It is at around 500 km (310 mi) south of Hà Nội (Hanoi), 260 km (160 mi) north of Đà Nẵng (Danang), 1,200 km (750 mi) north of Hồ Chí Minh City (Saigon). It borders Laos on the west, the South China Sea on the east, Hà Tĩnh province on the north, and Quảng Ninh in the south. Dong Hoi Airport is 6 km north of Dong Hoi. The city was close to the Vietnamese DMZ, and it was in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Since it was so close to the DMZ, it was important for the North Vietnamese. For this reason, the city was heavily bombed by the US Air Force. There is a cathedral called the Tam Toa Church that was bombed during the war. Tam Toa is still ruined today so people could remember the bombing of North Vietnam. == Administration == Dong Hoi is subdivided into 16 subdivisions, 10 urban wards (phường) and 6 rural communes (xã).
