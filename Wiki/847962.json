She was initiator and the first chair of the French-speaking Centre démocrate humaniste (cdH), the new name of the Parti social-chrétien (PSC) since 2002. She was deputy prime minister from 2008 to 2014 and held various ministerial positions. She was also a senator and an MP, a politician of the French Community and the Brussels-Capital Region, a councillor of both Woluwe-Saint- Pierre and Brussels and also an alderwoman of last one. She was nicknamed \"Madame Non\" because of her fierce opposition to a state reform desired by the Dutch-speaking parties during the cabinet formation in 2007. Milquet was born in Charleroi and studied law at the Catholic University of Louvain and the University of Amsterdam. She worked as a lawyer before entering into politics. == References == * De Standaard Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian lawyers Category:Centre démocrate humaniste politicians Category:Government ministers of Belgium Category:Parti social-chrétien politicians Category:Politicians from Brussels Category:People from Charleroi Category:Walloon politicians",
