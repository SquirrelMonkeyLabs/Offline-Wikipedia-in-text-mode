 "text": "Otto Arosemena Gómez (19 July 1925 - 20 April 1984) was President of Ecuador, November 16, 1966 to September 1, 1968. His government, though short, greatly increased Ecuador's development and ensured the consolidation of democracy. In accordance with the law, he called presidential elections, and Velasco Ibarra won for his fifth and final time. Arosemena finished his term on August 31, 1968. In 1965, when the country was facing one of its worst political, social, and economic crises—a result of dictatorial misrule—he founded a new political party in Quito called the Democratic Institutionalist Coalition (Coalición Institucionalista Demócrata, CID). One year later, he was elected Deputy of the Constituent Assembly held by \"President\" Yerovi Indaburu. The Constituent Assembly elected Arosemena President of Ecuador on November 16, 1966. Arosemena's political adversaries later attacked his policies, particularly with respect to oil policy. He responded by writing the book Infamy and Truth (Infamia y verdad), in which he addresses his administration's oil policy. Arosemena was born on 19 July 1925 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He studied at University of Guayaquil. Arosemena died on 20 April 1984 in Salinas, Ecuador from complications of a fall, aged 58.
