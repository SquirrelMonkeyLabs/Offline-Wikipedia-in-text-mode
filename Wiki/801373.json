 "text": "Chiaroscuro in art is the use of strong contrasts between light and dark. This is usually done to make the composition a lot more dramatic. It is also a technical term used by art historians and artists for the contrast of light. It gives a sense of volume when modelling three-dimensional (or 3D) figures. Similar effects used in photography and cinematography are also called chiaroscuro. The word comes from Italian, from the words \"chiaro\" (clear) + \"oscuro\" (dark).https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/chiaroscuro The word was first known to be used in the 1680s.https://www.etymonline.com/word/chiaroscuro.
