 "text": "Una Mae Carlisle (December 26, 1915 â€“ November 7, 1956) was an American jazz singer-songwriter and pianist. When Carlisle was still a child, she performed often on WHIO (AM) in Dayton, Ohio. In 1932, when Carlisle was still in her teens, Fats Waller discovered her while she was a Cincinnati, Ohio performer. Her piano style was influenced by Waller's. She incorporated humor into her sets. Carlisle played by herself starting in 1937. Late in the 1930s, she toured Europe repeatedly and recorded with Waller. In the 1940s, Carlisle recorded as a leader with Bluebird Records. Carlisle also saw success as a songwriter. Her 1941 song, \"Walkin' by the River\", made her the first black woman to have a composition on any United States' Billboard chart. She had her own radio show The Una Mae Carlisle Radio Show on WJZ-ABC. That made her \"the first Black American to host a national radio show.\" Later in the 1940s, Carlisle hosted several television programs. Carlisle was born in Zanesville, Ohio. She died from pneumonia at the age of 40 in Harlem, New York City. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1956 deaths Category:American singer-songwriters Category:African-American singers Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Singers from Ohio Category:People from Zanesville, Ohio",
