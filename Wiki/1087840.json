 "text": "Khalifa (خليفة) is a name which means \"leader\" or \"ruler\". The title is most commonly used for a leader of a caliphate but it is also used by Islamic groups such as Daesh and the Ahmadi community. The first Khalifa in the Rashidun Caliphate was Abu Bakr but many groups such as the Twelvers claim it was supposed to be Ali. This is due to the different interpretations of the word Khalifa between Sunni scholars and Shi'i scholars. == References == Category:Islam",
