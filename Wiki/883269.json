These lakes make the world's highest freshwater lake system with six main lakes. Among them Thonak Lake is the largest. In September 2007, Gokyo and sorrounding wetlands of were made into a Ramsar site.Bhandari, B. B. (2009). Wise use of Wetlands in Nepal. Banko Janakari, Special Issue February 2009: 10–17. ==Lake system== Gokyo Lakes are located in Khumjung, a village of Solukhumbu District in Sagarmatha Zone in north-eastern Nepal. Gokyo Cho, also called Dudh Pokhari, is the main lake with an area of . At the eastern shore of this lake is Gokyo village. Thonak Cho is the largest lake with an area of . Gyazumpa Cho is in size, while Tanjung Cho has an area of , and Ngojumba Cho has an area of . As sources of permanent fresh water they have high hydrological value. They get water from various sources, such as water that flows underground from the Ngozumpa glacier, a stream coming from the Renjo La pass from north-west, and another stream coming from the Ngozumpa glacier in the east. These wetlands are filled with water from many glaciers. The water from there goes to the Dudh Kosi through the Taujon Lake and the Longabanga Lake. These lakes are deeper than researchers use to believe. Fourth Lake (Thonak Cho) is the deepest lake which is 62.4 m deep. After that is the Gokyo Lake which is 43 m deep.Sharma, C. M., Sharma, S., Gurung, S., Bajracharya, R. M., Jüttner, I., Kang, S., Zhang, Q., Li, Q. (2012). First results on bathymetry and limnology of the Gokyo wetlands, high altitude tropical lakes, Nepal. Limnology 13:181–192. A direct connection between the Gokyo Lake and the upper Thonak Cho and the Ngozumpa Cho has not been seen. However, these lakes may be connected through an underground water supply. The Gokyo lake system is naturally at risk, as it is in an ecologically risky and unstable zone. The outburst of the Ngozumpa glacier is always a danger to the existence of the lakes. The Gokyo lake system of 19 lakes is covers an area of and is at the hight between . The wetland lies at the start of of the Dudh Kosi river, which flows down from Cho Oyu. == Religious significance == The Gokyo Lakes are considered sacred by both Hindus and Buddhists. About 500 Hindus take a holy bath in the lakes during the Janai Purnima festival, which usually occurs in the month of August. On average 7,000 tourists visit the Gokyo Lakes every year. The site is worshipped as the residing place of 'Nag Devata' (Snake God). A temple of the Hindu gods Vishnu and Shiva is at the western corner of the lake. The belief that birds and wildlife should not be harmed has protected the animals in this region for a long time. ==Tourism== Gokyo is among the most popular places for tourist to visit. From there, people can go towards the Sagarmatha base camp and other areas. Gokyo village at height is a major centre in the area. The site is two days' walk uphill from Namche Bazaar. A visit to the area usually includes climbing Gokyo Ri. The Gokyo Lakes are also part of a longer Everest Base Camp trek known as the EBC trek through the Gokyo Lakes. This trek is commonly hiked by people with slightly more time to trek as the path is 4 days longer than the usual EBC trek. The Gokyo Lakes trek also has the benefit of being a circular route, unlike the usual EBC trek where people return using the same path. ==Gallery== Gokyo Lakes, Langponga Tsho, Nepal, Himalayas.jpg|Langponga Tsho, 1st Gokyo Lake Gokyo Lakes, Taujung Tsho, Mountains of Nepal, Himalayas.jpg|Taujung Tsho, 2nd Gokyo Lake Gokyo Lake, Nepal, Himalayas.jpg|Dudh Pokhari, 3rd (Main) Gokyo Lake Gokyo Lakes, Thonak Tsho, Nepal, Himalayas.jpg|Thonak Tsho, 4th Gokyo Lake Gokyo-Lake 5-20-2007-gje.jpg|Ngozumpa Tsho, 5th Gokyo Lake ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Lakes of Nepal",
