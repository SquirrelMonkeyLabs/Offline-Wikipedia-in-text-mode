 "text": "A Rubik's Revenge is a 4x4 Rubik's Cube. It has 24 centers, 24 edges, and 8 corners. It was made by Peter Sebest√©ny. Unlike the Rubik's Cube, the centers can move to different places. == Ways to solve == There are different ways to solve a Rubik's Revenge. One way is to solve the centers, and then the edges. Then, you can solve it like a 3x3. But, special problems can happen. 2 edges flipped wrong, or 2 sets of edges could be swapped from each other. These problems are called parity errors. It can still be solved, but special moves must be done to solve it. Another way is to solve the edges first, then the centers. But, it is also possible to get parity errors. There are ways to solve a Rubik's Revenge without getting parity errors. One way is to solve the corners and edges first, then the centers. ==Related pages== *Pocket Cube *Rubik's Cube *Professor's Cube == Other websites == *How to solve a Rubik's Revenge Category:Rubik's Cube",
