It is located in the southern part of the Jordanian capital, Amman. It consists of several neighborhoods or residential communities (27 villages). It was added to the city's comprehensive plan in 2007 after the Greater Amman Municipality's decision to include vast lands east and south of Queen Alia International Airport to the south of the capital's scheme. It is worth noting that it was previously referred to as the town of Giza - that is, before it was annexed to the borders of the capital. It has an area of (558 km2) and a population of 60 thousand people. Category:Settlements in Amman Governorate",
