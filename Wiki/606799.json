It has almost the same design as the neighbouring Lavender station. The Downtown Line section is built on the site of the demolished The New 7th Storey Hotel, and opened on 22 December 2013. This station served as the northern terminus of the Downtown Line until 27 December 2015, when it was replaced by Bukit Panjang as the second phase of the line opens. As the distance between the platforms is relatively long, it is one of four stations to have travelators, with the others being Dhoby Ghaut Botanic Gardens and Serangoon. ==References== Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations",
