 "text": "The discography of Oasis, an English rock band, consists of seven studio albums, one live album, two compilation albums, two extended plays (EPs), five video albums and thirty-one singles. Oasis were formed in 1991 by vocalist Liam Gallagher, guitarist Paul Arthurs (also known as \"Bonehead\"), bassist Paul McGuigan (also known as \"Guigsy\") and drummer Tony McCarroll, a unit soon joined by guitarist, vocalist and lead songwriter Noel Gallagher, Liam's older brother. The band's debut album, Definitely Maybe, went straight to #1 in the UK Albums Chart and went on to be certified seven-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and the Canadian Recording Industry Association. Oasis' debut single, \"Supersonic\", peaked at #31 in the UK Singles Chart. The follow- up to Definitely Maybe was Oasis' highest-selling album to date; (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. It was recorded with new drummer Alan White, and is the third highest-selling album in the United Kingdom as of 2006, with 4.4 million units sold. The album was commercially successful, reaching #1 in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. It was certified 14 times platinum by the BPI, four times platinum by the RIAA, eight times platinum by the CRIA and six times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The first single from Morning Glory, \"Some Might Say\", was also the band's first #1 single. Oasis' third album, Be Here Now, reached the top spot in the albums charts of nine countries, and was their most successful album in the Billboard 200 where it reached #2. In 1998 the band released The Masterplan, a compilation of B-sides, which reached #2 and was certified platinum in the UK. ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== Year Album details Peak chart positions Certifications (sales thresholds) UK AUS CAN FRA GER IRE NL NZ SWE US 1994 Definitely Maybe *Released: 30 August 1994 *Label: Creation (CRE #169) *Formats: CD, LP, Cassette 1 23 9 — 33 1 55 5 4 58 *UK: 7× Platinum *EU: 2× Platinum *CAN: Platinum Note: User must define 'artist name' search parameters as \"Oasis\". *US: Platinum Note: User must define 'Artist' search parameter as \"Oasis\". *FRA: 2× Gold 1995 (What's the Story) Morning Glory?
