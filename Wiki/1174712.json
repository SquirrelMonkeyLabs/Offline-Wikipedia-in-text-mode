The name Nendoroid originates from the Japanese word \"Nendo\" (粘土), which is the Japanese word for clay, due to the prototypes of every figure being sometimes made out of synthetic plastics and other soft materials similar of that to clay the series is worked on by different people under the collective name, Nendoron but was originally created by Tsuyoshi Oda (who also goes by Oda-P.) == Reception == by March of 2009, Nendoroid had already sold over 1 million copies and it's spin-off, Nendoroid Petit had sold 3 million copies, and by 2010, there were 100 different Nendoroids. in May 2013, Good Smile Company released the 300th product in the Nendoroid line, named Hatsune Miku 2.0, which was a improved version of the previous best- selling Nendoroid, Hatsune Miku. ==References== Category:Toys",
