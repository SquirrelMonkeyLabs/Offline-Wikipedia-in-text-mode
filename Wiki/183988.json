It is the only living marsupial where both sexes have a backward-pointing pouch.The extinct thylacine also had this feature. The animal is found in the freshwater streams and lakes in Mexico, Central and South America. The water opossum lives in bankside burrows. It comes out after dusk to search for fish, crustaceans and other aquatic animals, which it eats on the bank.
