Fruit of our hands, Of the flower of our blood: This is our beloved fatherland. Long live our glorious fatherland! The banner of the struggle has fluttered in the skies. Forward, against the foreign yoke! 𝄆 We are going to build In our immortal fatherland Peace and progress! 𝄇 II Branches of the same trunk, Eyes in the same light; This is the force of our union! The sea and the land sing, The dawn and the sun That our struggle fertilised! ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Guinea-Bissau Category:1963 works",
