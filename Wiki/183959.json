 "text": "Rope is a 1948 American drama movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It stars James Stewart, John Dall and Farley Granger. It tells the story of two young intellectuals, played by Dall and Granger, who murder one of their friends in an apartment in Manhattan. They do it in order to prove that it is possible to commit the perfect murder. Then they hold a dinner party at which they invite the parents of the victim as well as their former teacher, played by Stewart. During the dinner party they come close to boasting about their crime and arouse the suspicions of the teacher who eventually exposes them and alerts the police. The movie is famous for seemingly being made in one long shot without changing the camera angle. It is also known for implying a homosexual relationship between the two intellectuals at a time when homosexuality was rarely mentioned in movies or popular American culture. ==References== * Category:1948 crime drama movies Category:American crime drama movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:English-language movies Category:LGBT crime movies Category:LGBT drama movies Category:Movies about murderers Category:Movies directed by Alfred Hitchcock Category:Movies set in Manhattan",
