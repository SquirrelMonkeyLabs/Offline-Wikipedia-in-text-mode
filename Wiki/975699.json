 "text": "Luís, Prince Imperial of Brazil (26 January 1878 – 26 March 1920), was a Prince of the Empire of Brazil and heir to the Brazilian throne until his death. He was born in Brazil during his grandfather's reign as the second son of Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, and Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. He was exiled along with his family as the result of the 1889 coup d'état that resulted in the formation of the republic. In 1908, the year he married, his older brother Pedro renounced his claim to succeed his mother in her claim to the imperial throne, leaving Dom Luís as her heir. In this role he worked with monarchists in Brazil in several attempts to restore the monarchy. At the outbreak of World War I he enlisted as an officer with the British Armed Forces and saw action in Flanders where he contracted a virulent form of rheumatism that caused his death at the age of 42. His efforts on behalf of the Allies of World War I saw him decorated by Belgium, France and Great Britain.Santos, Armando Alexandre dos, Dom Pedro Henrique: o Condestável das Saudades e da Esperança, Editora Artpress, 2006. ==References== Category:Brazilian royalty Category:1878 births Category:1920 deaths Category:People from Petrópolis",
