Its capital is Bardaï. It was created in 2008 when the former Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region was split into three. The Tibesti Department became the Tibesti Region. The region is named for the Tibesti Mountains, one of the most prominent mountain chains in the Sahara Desert. The area fell under French rule during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century. Prior to 1931 much of the region belonged to what is now Niger, as part of the French West Africa colony. == Subdivisions == The region of Tibesti is divided into two departments: Department Capital Sub-prefectures Tibesti Est Bardaï Bardaï, Zoumri, Aouzou, Yebbibou Tibesti Ouest Zouar Zouar, Wour, Goubonne ==References== Category:Regions of Chad Category:2008 establishments in Africa",
