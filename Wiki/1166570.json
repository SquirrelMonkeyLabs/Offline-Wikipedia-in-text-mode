 "text": "The Benadryl challenge was an internet challenge that went viral in 2020 on TikTok. This is about the planned use, too much use, and overdose of a medicine called diphenhydramine, which is often sold as Benadryl in the United States. In other countries, the name Benadryl might be used for a different medicine. For example, in the United Kingdom, it might be a different type of antihistamine. This medicine can cause confusion and hallucinations when taken in high amounts. On September 24, 2020, the FDA decided to advise many parents and medical practitioners to be aware of the challenge's prevalence and its risks. ==References== Category:2020 Category:Internet culture Category:Internet memes introduced in 2020 Category:Substance-related disorders Category:2020s fads and trends Category:Eating behaviors of humans Category:TikTok trends",
