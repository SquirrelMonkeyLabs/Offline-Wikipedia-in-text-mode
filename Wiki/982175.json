 "text": "The Experience machine is a thought experiment created by the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick. It was an argument against hedonism. ==Thought Experiment== If it were possible for anyone to plug themselves into a machine that could create an illusion of any experience, particularly whatever experience would give that person the most pleasure, then almost everyone would do it. Nozick used this to prove that there are no more important things than pleasure. One reason for the opposite may be that people want to be truly happy, not just simulate happiness. ==References== Category:Philosophy",
