 "text": "Ranoidea callista is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it on Mount Trafalgar, about 220 meters above sea level. The scientist who wrote the first formal paper about Ranoidea callista, Fred Kraus, said this frog is related to Litoria gracilenta but it has different colors on its skin, lays eggs in streams, and has a different call. Kraus says that the frog does not only live on Mt. Trafalgar but in many places in New Guinea. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
