They are one of the largest species of burrowing scorpion in Australia. They can live to years in captivy. In the outback, they live in constructed areas under rocks. == Selling == These scorpions are commonly sold in pet shops, and are dude to their large size. They are quite stocky than any other types of burrowing scorpions, and they should not be handled. They will inflict a nasty sting if they feel threatened. Some people reference the word to be painful, while others claim it worse as a bee sting. This scorpion does not cause death unlike its other cousin, the marbled scorpion. However, there is one case of a girl who had been stung by a marbled scorpion and later died. Category:Scorpions Category:Animals of Australia",
