 "text": "The blue and yellow frog, waxy monkey tree frog, bicolored frog or giant monkey frog (Phyllomedusa bicolor) is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, and the Guianas. Scientists think it might also live in Ecuador. People have seen this frog as high as 800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is to long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is to long. The skin on its back is dark green and the belly can be white or yellow. It has white spots with dark outlines on its front. There are even more spots on its sides. It has brown disks on its toes for climbing. The iris of its eye is gray in color. This frog makes chemicals in its skin that people put on arrows. The chemicals are poison. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. When it is time to lay eggs, the female finds a leaf on a branch hanging over a pond. She folds the leaf to make a nest. She puts 600 eggs at a time in the nest and covers them in jelly. The eggs take 8-10 days to hatch. The tadpoles fall out of the nest into the pond. Scientists think this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Cutting down forests is not good for this frog, and sometimes people sell them as pets, but the frog is not in danger. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
