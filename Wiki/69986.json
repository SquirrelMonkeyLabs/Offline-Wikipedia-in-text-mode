Rally around to the glory of our time! The blood surges in our veins, We die for the sake of our land. I Let the heavens roar with thunder Let thunderbolts rain with fire. Men and youth of Tunisia, Rise up for her might and glory. No place for traitors in Tunisia, Only for those who defend her! We live and die loyal to Tunisia, A life of dignity and a death of glory. II As a nation we inherited Arms like granite towers. Holding aloft our proud flag flying, We boast of it, it boasts of us, Arms that achieve ambitions and glory, Sure to realize our hopes, Inflict defeat on foes, Offer peace to friends. III ùÑÜ When the people will to live, Destiny must surely respond. Oppression shall then vanish. Fetters are certain to break. ùÑá Berber translation (Tifinagh)https://m.youtube.com/watch?si=QhUPaVS-3XWeBaX5&v;=gUZ3GrbsNXM&feature;=youtu.be Berber translation (Latin) ==References== Category:1987 works Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of Tunisia",
