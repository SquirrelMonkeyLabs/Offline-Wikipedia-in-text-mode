 "text": "Eagle, Jackdaw, and Shepherd is a story from Aesop's Fables. It teaches a lesson. An eagle saw a lamb and grabbed it to eat. A jackdaw saw the eagle. The jackdaw wanted to do the same thing! He flew down and landed on a ram. He tried to grab the ram but got stuck. A shepherd saw the jackdaw. He caught the jackdaw and cut its wings. He took the jackdaw home to his kids. The kids asked, \"What kind of bird is this?\" The shepherd said, \"It's a jackdaw. But it wants to be an eagle.\" The story teaches us not to try to be something we're not. Stay what you are! ==Lesson== Don't try to be something you're not. Accept yourself. ===Sources=== * Aesop's Fables by Aesop * The Fables of Aesop by Joseph Jacobs (1894) Category:Aesop's Fables",
