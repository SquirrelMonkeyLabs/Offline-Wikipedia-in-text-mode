 "text": "A classic car is an older automobile, generally one that is at least 25 years old. Classic cars are often very valuable to collectors, and may sell for many times their original factory price, especially if they have been well- maintained and have low mileage. Iconic cars that are less than 25 years old and may become classics are referred to as future classics. Classic cars are often not recommended as a daily driver. Replacement parts may be hard to find, and most classic cars lack safety features found in modern cars such as airbags and crumple zones. Contrary to popular belief, classic cars are structurally weaker than modern cars and will not hold up as well in a crash. ==References== Category:Automobiles",
