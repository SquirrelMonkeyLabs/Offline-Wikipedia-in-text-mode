 "text": "Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP or CRP), is a very strong, light and expensive composite material or fiber-reinforced plastic. Similar to glass- reinforced plastic, one uses commonly the name of its reinforcing fibers (carbon fiber) for the composite material. The plastic is most often epoxy, but other plastics, such as polyester, vinyl ester or nylon, are also sometimes used. Some composites contain both carbon fiber and other fibres such as kevlar, aluminium and fiberglass reinforcement. Less commonly, the terms graphite-reinforced plastic or graphite fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) are also used. It has many applications in aerospace and automotive fields, as well as in sailboats, and notably in modern bicycles and motorcycles, where these qualities are of importance. It is becoming increasingly common in small consumer goods as well, such as laptop computers, tripods, fishing rods, paintball equipment, racquet sports frames, stringed instrument bodies, classical guitar strings, and drum shells. Carbon fiber reinforced plastic is not always an appropriate substitute for steel or other metals. For example, the implosion of the Titan submersible was caused by inappropriate use of carbon fiber where steel or titanium should have been used instead. ==Related pages== *Carbon fiber *Graphite *Aramid *Fiberglass == Other websites == *Japan Carbon Fibre Manufacturers Association (English) *Carbon fibre page from the Department of Polymer Science at USM *Engineers design composite bracing system for injured Hokie running back Cedric Humes Category:Polymers Category:Synthetic materials",
