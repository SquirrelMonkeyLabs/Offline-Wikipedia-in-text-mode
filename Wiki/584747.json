 "text": "The Jidai Matsuri is a traditional Japanese festival held every year on October 22 in Kyoto, Japan. It is enjoyed by people of all ages, participating in its historic reenactment parade, dressed in historic costumes representing different periods of Japanese history. This festival started when the Japanese capital of Kyoto moved to Tokyo in 1868. This involved the movement of the Emperor of Japan and his family. The Jidai Matsuri begins early in the morning with small shrines brought out of the Kyoto Imperial Palace so people can pay their respects. The five-hour parade starts in the afternoon, with 2000 performers dressed as samurai, military figures, and common people from the Meiji era.
