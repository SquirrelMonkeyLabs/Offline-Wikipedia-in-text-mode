 "text": "Many-valued logic refers to any type of logic that contains more than two truth values. In the traditional logic like Aristotle's logic, there were only two values, \"true\" and \"false.\" In many-valued logic, more than two values could exist. There could be three, for instance: \"true,\" \"false,\" and \"unknown.\" There could also be four values, nine values, or even an infinite number, with examples like fuzzy logic and probability logic.
