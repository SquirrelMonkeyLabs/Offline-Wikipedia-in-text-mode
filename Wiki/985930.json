It was released as a single from their fourth album, Shake It Up. ==Composition== According to the liner notes of Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, \"Since You're Gone\" is an example of \"[a] more playful quality ... in Ocasek's writing\", with a Bob Dylan impersonation \"adopt[ed] when delivering [the line 'You're so trachea-ress!']\" Guitarist Elliot Easton plays a guitar solo that \"paid homage to King Crimson leader Robert Fripp[.]\" ==Release== In 1982, \"Since You're Gone\" was released as the second single from Shake It Up, following up on \"Shake It Up\". The song, backed with \"Think It Over\" in the US and \"Maybe Baby\" in the UK, peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 24 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The single was followed by \"Victim of Love\" in US, and \"Think It Over\" in Britain. Like many other songs by The Cars, \"Since You're Gone\" had a music video created to accompany it, starring Ric Ocasek \"moping around an empty apartment\". The video received adequate airplay on MTV at the time. ==References== Category:1982 songs Category:The Cars songs",
