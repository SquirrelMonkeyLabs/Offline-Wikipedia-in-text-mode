The Samuel Checkers-playing Program was among the world's first successful self-learning programs, and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of artificial intelligence (AI). He was also a senior member in the TeX community who devoted much time giving personal attention to the needs of users and wrote an early TeX manual in 1983.https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/thinkers/Samuel.html| History of Computers and Computing, Birth of the modern computer, The thinkers, Arthur Samuelhttp://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/voy/museum/samuel.html | Arthur Samuel == References == Category:1901 births Category:1990 deaths Category:American computer scientists Category:People from California",
