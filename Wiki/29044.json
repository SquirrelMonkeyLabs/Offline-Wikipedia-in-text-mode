 "text": "The Fiat Panda is a small car made by Fiat from 1980 to the present day. Normally it is bought by small families or young adults because the car is quite cheap and also the tax is not very high. The first generation launched in 1980, and in the UK a year later. A 4x4 model appeared in 1983. A major facelift arrived in 1986 and another one took place in 1991. In 1995, the Panda was axed from the UK with most other European markets following shortly after, remaining on sale in Italy right up to 2003. The second generation of 2003 was made in Poland and was the European Car Of The Year in 2004. It received some small updates during its run and was produced until the end of 2012. This car was also available as a 4x4, a 1.3 Multijet diesel and a sporty 100HP version. The Panda entered its third and current generation in 2011 with production moving back to Italy, with 2- and 4-cylinder petrol engines. Again it was also built with 4x4 drive and with a Multijet diesel engine. In 2020, the model underwent considerable technical changes, among which a new, mild- hybrid, 3-cylinder petrol engine.
