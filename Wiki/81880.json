 "text": "Post-hardcore is a musical genre that evolved from hardcore punk, itself a part of the broader punk rock movement. One of the main influences on this genre is the band Fugazi. Post-hardcore uses elements of hardcore, along with emo, metal, alternative rock or whatever, to create a more experimental sound. It can be more melodic than normal hardcore, but sometimes is heavier. ==Post- hardcore contributors== # Fugazi # Thrice # Enter Shikari # Alexisonfire # Boysetsfire # Silverstein # Rites of Spring # Maylene and the Sons of Disaster # The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus # Matchbook Romance # The Bled # My Chemical Romance # Story of the Year # Underoath # Hawthorne Heights # Senses Fail # Pierce the Veil # Escape the Fate # Sleeping with Sirens # Moose Blood ==References== Category:Music genres",
