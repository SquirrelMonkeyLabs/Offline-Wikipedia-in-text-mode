 "text": "Old-school hip hop (also old school rap) is the earliest recorded hip hop music. It lasted from the late 1970s to around 1983 or 1984. This music is said to have ended in the early-to-mid 1980s due to changes in rapping techniques and the accompanying music and rhythms. A lot of this music was about partying and having a good time. Old-school rappers include Kurtis Blow and Grandmaster Flash. Category:Hip hop",
