Our motherland's heart, our lives and deaths, Thee we praise; \"Bless'd be our native homeland!\" II Our fathers' souls to Bashlam's peak descend, Argun's wave our mother tongue speaketh. 𝄆 Thee our lives bestow'd us with largesse grand, The song of Shatlak granted us vital strength! 𝄇 Love for labour and grit, honour for all folks, Let this great fame for thee be delightful news. 𝄆 Guardian of freedom who hath found its path, Live and prosper for us, o Chechnya of worth! 𝄇 ==References==",
