It was a magazine for alternative punk music and received government funding. It is now an alternative media outlet which talks about lifestyle, the arts, culture, news and politics. When the editors later sought to get rid of their connections with the original publisher Alix Laurent, they bought him out and changed the name to Vice in 1996. As of February 2018, the magazine's editor- in-chief is Ellis Jones and former editor-in-chief for the UK, Alex Miller, was appointed to the position of global head of content. ==Related pages== * Gavin McInnes, who left Vice in 2008 because of \"creative differences\". ==References== Category:1994 establishments in Canada Category:American magazines Category:Magazines of Canada Category:Magazines published in New York City",
