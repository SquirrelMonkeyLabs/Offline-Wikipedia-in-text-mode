He also played for England over 100 times and scored more goals than any other player. He played for England when they beat Germany in the World Cup final in 1966. He is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. His older brother was Jack Charlton. He was the last survivor of the Munich air disaster, where his life was saved by fellow teammate Harry Gregg. Charlton died on 21 October 2023 from problems caused by dementia, aged 86.
