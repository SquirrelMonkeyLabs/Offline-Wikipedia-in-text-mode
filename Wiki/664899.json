Blum is a Republican. Blum won the Republican primary in 2014. He defeated Patrick Murphy in the November 4, 2014 general election with 51% of votes. Blum ran for reelection in 2016. He faced the Democrat Monica Vernon in the general election. He defeated Vernon with 54% of the vote. Blum calls himself a Tea Party Republican. He said \"The Tea Party is what the Republican Party should have always been\". Blum favors getting rid of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). In 2017, he didn't support the original version of the American Health Care Act of 2017, or Trumpcare. Trumpcare was the Republicans' bill to get rid of and replace Obamacare. Blum said the original Trumpcare didn't do enough to lower premiums for hard-working Americans. As of November 1, 2018, Blum was under investigation by the United States House Ethics Committee Committee. That's because he might have violated certain ethics rules. He might have done so by not disclosing his ownership of a digital marketing company, Tin Moon. Blum was born in Dubuque, Iowa. ==References== Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:United States representatives from Iowa Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from Dubuque, Iowa",
