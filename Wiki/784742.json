 "text": "Petunia Pig is an animated fictional character under the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons from Warner Bros. She looks quite a bit like her significant other, the Porky Pig. But she wears braids and a dress. Petunia was introduced by the animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short Porky's Romance. The movie is a parody of a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon called Mickey's Nightmare, except Mickey Mouse marries his long-time girlfriend Minnie Mouse in that movie. Porky's overtures toward Petunia bring him only the scornful laughs of his lover pig. Tashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky's crew. He (Tashlin) showed her in two more cartoons: The Case of the Stuttering Pig and Porky's Double Trouble. As Porky's being popular was overshadowed in the late 1930s and 1940s by other characters, such as Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, he himself was reduced to a supporting player under new Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts. Petunia, only a bit player to Porky's lead, fared worse. But later, Petunia made appearances in other specials, like Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol. The regular adult Petunia was a guest star under DC Comics' Looney Tunes comic book and in the official Looney Tunes website. Petunia also appears in Looney Tunes Cartoons. Her first showing in the series was presented in the piece Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny. ==References== Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:Anthromophic characters Category:Fictional pigs Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1937",
