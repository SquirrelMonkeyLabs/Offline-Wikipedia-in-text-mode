The Gallery writes, \"Hals was the first portraitist who consistently depicted his subjects seated sideways, with their arms hooked casually over the backs of their chairs. Coymans, an elegant dandy proud of his expensive clothes, wears an embroidered jacket and sports a pom–pom on his hat, which is pushed forward rakishly. Hals' dazzling brushwork is especially evident in the gold embroidery and the crisply pleated shirt–sleeve.\"Willem Coymans National Gallery of Art ==References== Category:Paintings in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC Category:Dutch paintings Category:1640s paintings",
