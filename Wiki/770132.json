The Championships have taken place every four years, with a few exceptions. Since 2010, they have been organised every two years. However in years where with the Summer Olympics, the marathon and racewalking events are held, the championships are cancelled. From 2018, European Championships not held in an Olympic year will form part of the European Championships. ==References== Category:1934 establishments in Europe Category:Biennial athletics competitions Category:European championships Category:1934 in sports",
