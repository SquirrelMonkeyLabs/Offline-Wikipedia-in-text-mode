 "text": "Time Cube was a personal website created in 1997 by Otis Eugene Ray. On that website, Ray explained his theory of everything, known as \"Time Cube\". It described the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry, and time as rotating four \"corners\". He also said that all of modern physics is wrong. Scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested. On his site, Ray said that not believing in Time Cube would be \"stupid and evil\". Some of his comments were racist and discriminatory towards black people, Jews, and gay people. Many people found the site to be difficult to understand. Ray spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in January 2002. At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it happened. Ray believed this was proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden. Ray also spoke about Time Cube at the Georgia Institute of Technology in April 2005.\"Oddball Time Cube theorist piques interest, elicits mixed response\", by Joshua Cuneo, The Technique. Georgia Institute of Technology. April 22, 2005. Retrieved July 25, 2010. Ray died on March 18, 2015. He was 87 years old. His website went down in August 2015.
