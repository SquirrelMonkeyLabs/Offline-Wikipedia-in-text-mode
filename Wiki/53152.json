 "text": "Lexington is the 2nd largest city in Kentucky. In 2020, 322,570 people lived there. It is called \"the Horse Capital of the World\". ==History== Lexington was first named by a party of Virginians who camped here in June, 1775, after they heard the news about the Battle of Lexington, Massachusetts in April of that year starting the American Revolution against the British government. A fort was begun at the same spot in 1779, and by 1782 there was a town here known as Lexington, Virginia. This is because Kentucky was still part of Virginia then, and was not made into a state of its own until 1792. The Fifth Third Bank building located near the city center is a famous local landmark, and is sometimes called ‘The Big Blue Building.’ ==References== Category:County seats in Kentucky Category:1782 establishments in North America Category:1780s establishments in Virginia",
