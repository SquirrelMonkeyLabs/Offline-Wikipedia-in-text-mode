 "text": "A. Krishnappa (10 April 1945 - 23 April 2014) was an Indian politician. In 1985, he was elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Varthur Assembly Constituency in the state of Karnataka. Krishnappa was a member of the Congress Party for almost three decades. After he left it he joined the Janata Dal party. He contested as the Janata Dal candidate from Tumkur parliamentary constituency in the next elections and was confident of winning the seat. Being a former minister and a leader of backward classes as well, he was elected as the state president in the month of September 2013 after H D Kumaraswamy gave up his position. Mr. Krishnappa served at the Varthur constituency for almost four courses, that is twenty years in total and worked as a Minister for Animal Husbandry, Social Welfare, Horticulture, and Sugar. Following the polls, Mr. Deve Gowda said to press persons of The Hindu that by naming A. Krishnappa, one thing had been confirmed. It is that the Janata Dal was not a political party of father and son as it was claimed by other political critics. “This is the testimony of the party’s concern for backward classes,” as mentioned in the news reports. In the year 2015, The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike election for the wards within the K R Puram Assembly Constituency had transformed into a personal argument between the Congress MLA, Byrati Basavaraj, and former BJP MLA, N. S. Nandiesha Reddy. Until 2008, this constituency was a Congress stronghold that was represented by Mr. A Krishnappa. But, Nandeesh Reddy won the assembly election in 2008. The BJP won eight out of nine wards in the 2010 BBMP elections. Congress only won the Basavanapura ward in K.R.Puram. It was a time where a Congress win would accommodate Basavaraju to additionally strengthen his post and make an appearance as the new leader in Bengaluru. While for Nandeesh Reddy, a win would encourage him to recover his grip on the constituency. In the year 2013, N. Dharam Singh, former chief minister of Karnataka, Mr. Krishnappa along with a few other corporators of K R Puram looked over and examined the hanging bridge of Krishnarajapuram that was initiated on January 26, 2003, by the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. ==Passing away== Mr. Krishnappa was the chairperson of the South East Asian Education Trust. He died on April 23, 2014. Mr. Krishnappa suffered a heart attack in the evening while he was playing badminton in his SEA college of Engineering at Ayyappa Nagar circle in K R Puram. News reports state that he was resting in the badminton arena around 6 in the evening during when he abruptly complained of chest pain and collapsed in the court. He was rushed to the K R Puram Super Speciality Hospital. Mr. Krishnappa’s body was brought to BVN High School in Devasandra, where he served as a committee member for more than a decade. It was kept for his supporters, companions, and other people to look at him for the last time. ==Other information== A statue and a Mahal have been built in his SEA education institution to commemorate him. It is named after him as Krishna Mahal. ==Related pages== * Indian National Congress ==References== ==Other websites== * https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay.aspx?newsID=230627 * https://www.facebook.com/AKrishnappaExMinister/photos/pcb.917967091607783/917966904941135 Category:1945 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Politicians from Karnataka",
