 "text": "The Kellogg–Briand Pact (also called the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War or the World Peace Act) was an agreement on peace signed on August 27, 1928, by several countries. Some of these countries were the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and Germany. It was named after its authors, Frank B. Kellogg and Aristide Briand. The pact said that war was wrong and should be banned, but said nothing about what to do with a country that went to war anyway. The pact was the result of a determined American effort to avoid involvement in the European alliance system. The Kellogg–Briand Pact was registered with the League of Nations on Tuesday 4 September, 1928. Category:War Category:1920s treaties Category:League of Nations",
