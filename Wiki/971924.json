 "text": "Power Girl, also known as Kara Zor-L and Karen Starr, is a superheroine appearing in American comic books by DC Comics, created by Gerry Conway and Ric Estrada, and making her first appearance in All Star Comics #58 (1976). == Overview == The character is the Earth-Two equivalent of Supergirl, native Kryptonian and cousin to Superman. Born as Kara Zor-L on the dying planet Krypton, her parents eventually sent her in a ship to the planet Earth, where she became a computer programmer known as Karen Starr at Starrware Industries and a superhero. Although she left Krypton at the same time that her cousin did, Kara's ship took a much longer journey, resulting in her arriving on Earth decades after Kal-El. Her origins have changed several times in continuity when the Multiverse was erased Post-Crisis, and she has also been seen as a descendant of Arion with ties to Atlantis. During The New 52, Kara Zor-El from Earth 2 became Power Girl after Superman's death. In the Dawn of DC, Power Girl no longer wants to be called Karen Starr, so her \"cousin\" Jon Kent began refer to her as Paige. She later formalized this as her new secret identity of Dr. Paige Stetler. She has been a member of the Justice League, the Justice Society, the Wonders of the World, Infinity, Inc., Birds of Prey, Heroz4U, the Suicide Squad, the Lords of Order, and the Sovereign Seven. Another character called Power Girl was Tanya Spears, a member of Teen Titans. Category:DC Comics characters",
