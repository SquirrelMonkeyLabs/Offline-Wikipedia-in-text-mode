 "text": "Kes is a character in the TV show Star Trek: Voyager. She is played by Jennifer Lien. The show is about a spaceship that is lost in space and tries to get back to Earth. Kes joins the crew in the first episode and helps take care of the ship's medical needs. She is a special kind of alien who can read minds and has only nine years to live. Kes helps the ship's doctor be more human and deals with her boyfriend's jealousy. She also tries to learn more about her own powers, but they become too strong and she leaves the ship. Later, she comes back for one episode. The people who created Voyager wanted Kes to be a character who was getting older quickly, so people watching the show could see how time goes by. Kes is shown as being weak and innocent, but also strong and mature. Jennifer Lien had some problems that made it hard for her to work on the show, so she was let go. At the time, this was not explained clearly, and other reasons were given for her leaving. These reasons included Lien wanting to do other jobs or being replaced by another actress, Jeri Ryan, who played the character Seven of Nine. == References == * * * Category:Science fiction",
