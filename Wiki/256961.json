 "text": "\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is a song by The Beatles from their album Abbey Road. It was written by John Lennon, although it is credited to Lennon/McCartney. The song is an unusual Beatles song for many reasons, its length (nearly eight minutes), small number of lyrics (only fourteen different words are sung), three-minute descent through the same repeated guitar chords, and sudden ending. It is also one of the last songs that the Beatles mixed as a group, on August 20, 1969. Category:The Beatles songs Category:1969 songs",
