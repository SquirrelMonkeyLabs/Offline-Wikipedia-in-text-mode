 "text": "In Norse mythology, Vanaheimr (Old Norse for \"home of the Vanir\") is one of the Nine Worlds and home of the Vanir. The Vanir are the gods of fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future. Vanaheimr is described in the Poetic Edda; which was put together in the 13th century from earlier stories. The Prose Edda and Heimskringla were both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, Vanaheimr is said to be the location where the Van god Njörðr was raised. In Norse cosmology, Vanaheimr is considered one of the Nine Worlds. == References == Category:Places in Norse mythology",
