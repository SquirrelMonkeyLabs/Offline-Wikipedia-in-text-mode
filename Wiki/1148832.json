He became a head coach for the Raiders franchise from 1998 to 2001, where he won two consecutive division titles and made an AFC Championship Game appearance. In 2002, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, making them to their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII the same season. When he was 39 years old, he became the youngest coach at the time to win a Super Bowl. Gruden was Tampa Bay's head coach until 2008, setting a team record for most wins, but his team only made the playoffs two more times. After being fired by the Buccaneers, Gruden worked as an analyst for ESPN's Monday Night Football from 2009 to 2017.
