 "text": "James V of Scotland (10 April 1512 – 14 December 1542) became king when he was just a baby, following the death of his father, James IV of Scotland, in 1513. He was crowned at only 17 months old. Since he was so young, Scotland was ruled by regents, starting with his mother, Margaret Tudor, and later by his cousin, John Stewart, Duke of Albany. James took control of his kingdom in 1528, after escaping from his stepfather, Archibald Douglas. He then exiled Douglas and took away the lands of the powerful Douglas family. James worked to strengthen the kingdom by tightening control over royal estates, customs, and the justice system. He founded the College of Justice in 1532 and acted to bring more order to troubled areas like the Scottish Borders and the Hebrides. He married twice, both times to French noblewomen—Madeleine of Valois and later Mary of Guise—strengthening ties with France. Though Protestantism began to spread in Scotland during his reign, James stayed Catholic. He used his loyalty to the Catholic Church to increase his power and was even granted the title \"Defender of the Faith\" by the Pope. James was known for being suspicious of his nobility and took harsh measures against them, but he was also seen as a \"poor man's king\" for helping the common people. He spent money on the arts and built many royal buildings in a grand style. James died after a Scottish defeat by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss in 1542. His only surviving child,Mary, Queen of Scots, was just six days old when she became queen. ==Other websites== Category:1512 births Category:1542 deaths Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland Category:16th century in Scotland",
