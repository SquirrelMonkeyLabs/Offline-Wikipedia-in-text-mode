Born in the U.S. state of Oklahoma, she developed interests in singing from a young age but was held back by her shyness before audiences. Inspired by performances by ventriloquists, including the performances of Terry Fator, she developed a talent for ventriloquism, combining this with her skill at singing when performing in a local talent competition with her first puppet in 2014.
