 "text": "The white-lipped tree frog, Java tree frog, upland tree frog, or Taiwan whipping frog (Polypedates braueri) is a frog. It lives in China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, and India. Human beings brought them to Guam by accident. People have seen them between 0 and 2200 meters above sea level. This frog can live in forests, in fruit tree farms, and in bamboo. The female frog makes a nest out of foam on a plant over a pool and lays 400-500 eggs at a time. These frogs can lay eggs over many types of water, but they like shallow water with many plants the most. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it can live in places that humans have changed. The frogs that live in Taiwan may be threatened by Polypedates megacephalus, which humans brought to Taiwan. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
