 "text": "A vertex is a corner. More than one vertex are called vertices. A vertex is a point where two or more lines, curves, rays, or sides meet, and is often represented by letters such as P, Q, R and S. For example, the vertex of an angle is the point where the two edges of the angle intersect, and a vertex of a cube is simply one of its cornersâ€”of which there are eight. The concept of vertex applies to both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometrical objects. For example, a tetrahedron has four vertices, and a pentagon has five vertices. == Related pages == * Graph (mathematics) * Vertex figure == References == Category:Geometry",
