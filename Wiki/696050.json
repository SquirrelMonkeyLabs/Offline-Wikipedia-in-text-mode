 "text": "Aker (also known as Akeru) is the ancient Egyptian god of Earth and the horizon. He guarded the eastern and western borders of the netherworld. He protected Ra, the sun god, when he entered the netherworld at sunset and when he returned to the world of the living at sunrise and bore the sun on his back through the underworld. He welcomed the deceased pharaoh Apep (Apophis) and was rumored to have the ability to neutralize a snake bite. ==References== ==Other websites== *Aker, at Ancient Egypt on line Category:Egyptian gods and goddesses",
