 "text": "An interchange station or a transfer station is a train station for more than one railway route in a public transport system that allows passengers to change from one route to another, often without having to leave a station or pay an additional ticket. Transfer may occur within the same railway network, or between different railway networks (e.g. transfer between a metro rail network, a suburban rail network or a tram network), or to buses (for stations with bus stations or bus termini attached). Such stations usually have more platforms than single route stations. These stations can exist in city centers and in suburbs. Interchange stations are most common in metro and suburban rail networks. Category:Railway stations",
