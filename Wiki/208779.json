 "text": "A nuclear chain reaction is a nuclear reaction in which a heavy isotope atom such as uranium or plutonium splits and the neutrons released by the fissioning of that atom strike and split other heavy atoms which, as a result, hit others one after another after another. Chain reactions are the main way of getting nuclear energy. Power plants use a slow chain reaction to make steam. Fast reactions can make a nuclear explosion. Nuclear reactions make ionizing radiation that is harmful to life. Category:Nuclear physics",
