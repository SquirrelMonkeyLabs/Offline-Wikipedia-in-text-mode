 "text": "Roderick Anthony Burton II (November 25, 1987 â€“ May 18, 2009) was an American rapper and songwriter better known by his stage name Dolla. Burton began his music career in 2000 as a member of the hip hop group Da Razkalz Cru, under the stage name Bucklyte. After he was signed to Akon's Konvict Muzik label in 2007, he released his first single \"Who The Fuck is That\" featuring T-Pain and Taye Dzim. The song peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100. There was also an edited version of \"Who The Fuck is That\", titled \"Who The Heck is That\". He released two other singles until his death: \"I'm Fucked Up\" in the summer of 2008 and \"Make a Toast\" (featuring Julian) on November 4, 2008. On May 18, 2009, Dolla was shot by 23-year-old Aubrey Lewis Berry in Los Angeles. The two had an argument. Seconds later, Berry shot Dolla in the parking lot of a PF Chang's, a casual dining restaurant. Berry fled and Dolla was taken to a hospital where he later died. On May 22, 2010, charges were dropped against Berry for Dolla's death, as he was claiming self-defense. Evidence pointed out that Berry felt threatened by Burton due to a previous altercation in Atlanta a week before the shooting. Burton's funeral was held in Atlanta's east point neighborhood on May 23, 2009. He was buried in Westview Cemetery in Atlanta. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:2009 deaths Category:African- American rappers Category:American murder victims Category:Rappers from Illinois Category:Rappers from Atlanta Category:Murdered musicians Category:Murders by firearm in California Category:Musicians from Chicago",
