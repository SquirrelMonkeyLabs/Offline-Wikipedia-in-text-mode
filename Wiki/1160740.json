 "text": "\"Just as I Am\" is a Christian hymn, written by Charlotte Elliott in 1835. It first appeared in the Christian Remembrancer. ==Lyrics== Just as I am - without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - and waiting not To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - though toss'd about With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - poor, wretched, blind; Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need, in Thee to find, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - Thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve; Because Thy promise I believe, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - Thy love unknown Has broken every barrier down; Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, -O Lamb of God, I come! Just as I am - of that free love The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove, Here for a season, then above, -O Lamb of God, I come!Selections from the poems of Charlotte Elliott, 1873, Publisher: London, The Religious tract society ==References== Category:Christian hymns",
