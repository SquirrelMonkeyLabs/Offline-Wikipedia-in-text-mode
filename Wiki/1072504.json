 "text": "The Alpine goat is a medium to large-sized domestic breed known for its excellent milking ability. These goats, originating from the French Alps, have no set colors or markings, although certain markings are frowned upon. They possess horns, a straight profile, and upright ears. Mature females (called \"does\") weigh around 61 kg (135 lbs) and stand about 76 cm (30 in) tall at the shoulder. Alpine goats can vary in color, ranging from white or gray to brown and black. They are heavy milkers, and their milk is used to make various dairy products such as butter, cheese, soap, and ice cream. Alpine goats are commonly employed in commercial dairy production as well as on homesteads. == Types == There are different sub-types of Alpine goats, including Purebred (French) Alpines and American Alpines. The latter has been influenced by other genetic factors after it was introduced to the United States, keeping its visual traits and temperament similar to French Alpines. == Characteristics == Alpine goats are medium to large size, with males over 81 cm (32 in) tall at the withers and females over 76 cm (30 in). They have short to medium-length hair and also come in various colors. Known for being \"alertly graceful,\" they adapt well to different climates due to their sturdy nature. Alpine goats are friendly and curious, but can be independent and strong-willed. The sexual maturation rate is around four to five months for buck kids (male baby goats) and five to six months for doe (female) kids. The gestation period for does is 145–155 days, with twins being the most common, but they can have singles or even quintuplets. == Milk == The Alpine goat is famous for its milk production. It is also known for its docile behavior, high-quality milk, and long lactation period. Alpine milk has a lower fat content than cow's milk but balances well in terms of protein and sugars. Despite their size, Alpine goats produce lots of milk, with optimal production occurring after four to six weeks of kidding. Efficient dairy production in Alpine goats requires specific conditions, including adequate ventilation, dry beds, uncontaminated feeder and water supply, and minimal disturbance. Alpine milk must be filtered and chilled immediately for human consumption, with the ideal temperature being 4.4 °C (39.9 °F). Proper cooling is crucial to prevent bacterial growth, and refrigerated milk has a shelf life of about three to four weeks. Alpine goats, along with Saanen and Toggenburg goats, are among the top milk producers. Their milk, with a fat content of 3.4%, is considered a healthy choice. Good nutrition, proper milking procedures, reproductive management, and disease control contribute to optimal milk production in Alpine goats. Category:Goat breeds",
