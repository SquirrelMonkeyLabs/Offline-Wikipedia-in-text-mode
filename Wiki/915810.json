 "text": "In wrestling, there are competitions for men and for women. Female competitors wear a dress which resembles a swimsuit. This dress has been criticized as being too revealing. The discussion that womens' sports dresses are too revealing also is also used for other sports such as beach handball, where Norway's women team was fined, because they refused to wear bikini bottoms, and instead wore shorts, like the male team. == References == Category:Wrestling",
