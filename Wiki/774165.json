 "text": "The Heckler & Koch VP70 is a 9x19mm Parabellum handgun made by Heckler & Koch, a German gun company. It was the first polymer-framed pistol ever made. It was first made 1970, 12 years before the Glock. Being polymer-framed means that it was much lighter than metal-framed handguns. It can be attached with a buttstock, and doing so will allow the gun to fire in 3-shot bursts. Otherwise, the gun only fires in semi-automatic mode. Category:Pistols",
