 "text": "Countryliner was a bus company in Uckfield in England. It was big, running more than fifty bus services mostly in Sussex. The company closed on the 18th of January 2013 under a new bus operating licence called SwiftBus Limited that was before that known as the RJB (UK) Limited licence. The main Countryliner company closed on the 8th of October 2012. ==Closure== The Countryliner company got involved in a Surrey County Council public inquiry which asked people what they thought about Countryliner. Countryliner was in quite a lot of debt, so they paid it as much of it off to try and stop the company from closing. Sadly, the company got closed because their buses had high M.O.T. failures. ==Sunray Travel== Countryliner's buses went to Sunray Travel when Sunray Travel started to drive service 479 Guildford-Epsom commercially. ==Fleet== Countryliner used a mixture of Plaxton Pointer Dennis Darts, MAN 12.220 MCV Evolutions, Optare Excels, Plaxton Premieres and more for their bus and school services. ==References== Category:Companies of the United Kingdom Category:Public transport in the United Kingdom Category:1998 establishments in England",
