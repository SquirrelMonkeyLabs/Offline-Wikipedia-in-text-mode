 "text": "Grand Theft Auto VI is an upcoming 2026 video game. It is going to be published by Rockstar Games and developed by Rockstar Studios. It will be the eighth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series, following Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstar Games announced that the game would be released in autumn of 2025, but this has been postponed to May 26, 2026. In July 2022, it was reported that the main characters of Grand Theft Auto VI would be both a man and a woman named Lucia, with their characters being influenced by criminal duo Bonnie and Clyde. It was also revealed that the game will take place in Vice City. On September 18, 2022, a leak was released and was later confirmed to be real by Rockstar. In the leak, there were 90 videos posted which showed footage of the game in a work-in-progress state. A 17-year-old from Oxfordshire who is believed to have posted the leak under the username \"teapotuberhacker\" was arrested on 22 September. A judge would sentence him to an indefinite hospital order since he said that he would still do cybercrime if he was released. On December 4, 2023, Rockstar released an official trailer for the game and revealed that the release date was expected to be in 2025. == Setting == The game takes place in several counties in the State of Leonida, including Vice-Dale County (home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City). To date, three counties have been identified by name via trailers and promotional material. The entire playable area of Leonida has yet to be officially revealed. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2026 Category:Upcoming video games VI Category:2020s video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Open-world video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
