 "text": "The Reformed Church in Hungary (Hungarian: Magyarországi Református Egyház, MRE) is the largest Calvinist church in Hungary. == History == The Reformation spread to Hungary during the 16th century. In Geneva, Switzerland, John Calvin developed the teachings of the Reformed Church. His followers spread the Reformed (Calvinist) message across Europe. The Calvinist branch of the Reformation in Hungary adopted two confessions of faith in Debrecen in 1567: the Heidelberg Catechism and the Second Helvetic Confession. From the Synod of Debrecen in 1567, the existence of the Reformed Church of Hungary is officially counted. == Organizational structure == In Hungary, about 1,200 congregations belong to four church districts and 27 church dioceses. Reformed Christians make up about 16% of the population. The organizational structure of the congregations follows the synodal-presbyterian principle. Each church district is led by a bishop and their lay co-president, the chief elder. Similarly, each church diocese is headed by a dean and a diocesan chief elder, while the leadership of individual congregations consists of the pastor and one or more elders. ==References== Category:Protestant Reformation Category:Protestant denominations Category:Calvinism",
