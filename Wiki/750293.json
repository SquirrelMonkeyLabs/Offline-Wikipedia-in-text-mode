 "text": "Linda Rose Tripp (née Carotenuto; November 24, 1949 – April 8, 2020) was an American civil servant. She played an important role in the Lewinsky scandal of 1998. Tripp's action in secretly recording Monica Lewinsky's secret phone calls about her relationship with the president caused a sensation with their links to the earlier Clinton v. Jones lawsuit. Tripp claimed that her motives were patriotic, and she was able to avoid a wiretap charge for handing in the tapes. She then claimed that her firing from the Pentagon at the end of the Clinton administration was because she leaked the phone calls, while the administration claimed it to be a standard routine. From 2004, Tripp worked with her husband in a retail business in Middleburg, Virginia. Tripp was born in Jersey City, New Jersey. She died from pancreatic cancer in Middleburg at the age of 70 on April 8, 2020. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Businesspeople from New Jersey Category:Bill Clinton",
