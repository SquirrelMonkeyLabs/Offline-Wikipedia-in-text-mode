 "text": "Biasing in electronics is using specific voltages and/or currents at points of an electronic circuit to set an appropriate operating point. The operating point of a device, also known as bias point, is the point that shows (in case of transistor) the direct current, collector-emitter voltage, and the collector current with no input signal. The term biasing is usually used with transistors, vacuum tubes or diodes. Category:Electronics",
