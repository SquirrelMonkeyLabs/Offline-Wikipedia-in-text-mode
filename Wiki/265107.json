 "text": "Vehicle insurance (also called auto insurance or car insurance) is a kind of insurance that protects people if they have a car accident. Somebody with vehicle insurance would not have to pay the entire cost of damage a car accident causes. In many places, it is against the law to drive without vehicle insurance. The driver pays a premium to the car insurance company. In exchange, the company covers the potential cost of damages and financial loss that are a result of driving. The bare minimum everyday driver should require to purchase liability coverage. It varies from state to state and it is important to have the minimum amount as required by law. You can receive a ticket, have your driver's license revoked, or even be arrested. Liability is there to protect the other drivers on the road from the damages you cause. Insurance prices vary a lot by the company. The car you drive can affect your auto insurance rates. If you get in an accident the repairs on the car may be different from others. ==Premium== Somebody with vehicle insurance would pay what is called a premium (perhaps every month). The insurance company would decide how big the premium is and might consider several factors. These include some of the following: *Age *Type of car *Type of job *Gender *Home *History of insurance *Past accidents When you pay a premium, the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as outlined in your policy. Depending on different factors, the insurance company may not pay all or any of your losses. ==References== Category:Insurance",
