On July 1, McCartney overdubbed lead vocals onto take 30, and added more vocals and chimes on July 15. \"You Never Give Me Your Money\" was originally to transition into \"Sun King\" with a long organ note. This was recorded along with more vocals on July 30. They were scrapped the following day, when McCartney completed the song by adding bass guitar and piano. The \"Sun King\" crossfade was completed on August 5 with a series of tape loops containing the sounds of bells, birds, bubbles and insects. ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney: lead and background vocals; piano and bass; wind chimes and tape loops. *John Lennon: fuzzed lead guitar and background vocals. *George Harrison: chiming lead guitar and background vocals. *Ringo Starr: drums and tambourine. ==Other websites== Category:The Beatles songs Category:1969 songs",
