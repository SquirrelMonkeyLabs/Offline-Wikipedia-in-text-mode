They take more money from investors than they need and plan to abscond to Brazil as soon as the play closes, only to see the show turn out to be a hit. The Producers was the first movie directed by Mel Brooks. He won an Academy Award for his screenplay. Decades later, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry and placed 11th on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list.
