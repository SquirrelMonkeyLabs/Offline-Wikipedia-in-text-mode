 "text": "2-1-1 is a special telephone number in the United States and Canada. It was made to be easy to remember. Calling the number lets people get information quickly about health organizations. It can also be called in an emergency. ==History== New York Telephone (now part of Verizon) used the 2-1-1 number for many years. It was an automatic, meaning it worked by itself, number for phone numbers that were dialed wrongly. 2-1-1 was used this way from the 1970s through the early 2000s. The city of Atlanta started a new way of using 2-1-1 in 1997. This new way of using it was similar to how it is used now. After Atlanta, many other cities and states started to use it as a special number to call in an emergency. 5-1-1 is also used for this. ==Other websites== *Canada **211Canada.ca **211 Canada Information Weblog **211 Halton Region (Ontario, Canada) **211 Niagara Region (Ontario, Canada) **211 Simcoe County (Ontario, Canada) **211 Toronto (Ontario, Canada) **211 Calgary (Alberta, Canada) **Windsor and Essex County (Ontario, Canada) **CRTC Decision 2001-475 establishing use of 2-1-1 in Canada **InformCanada National Association **InformOntario Provincial Association **2-1-1 Edmonton *United States **211 status in the U.S. **Alliance of Information & Referral Systems **Atlanta United Way page on 2-1-1 **FCC fact sheet on 2-1-1 **National 211.org site homepage **2-1-1 Virginia **211 Palm Beach/Treasure Coast **2-1-1 Big Bend Inc. **2-1-1 Los Angeles County **2-1-1 San Luis Obispo County **2-1-1 NW Oregon & SW Washington **2-1-1 Missouri Category:Emergency phone numbers Category:Telephone numbers in Canada Category:Telephone numbers in the United States Category:N11 codes",
