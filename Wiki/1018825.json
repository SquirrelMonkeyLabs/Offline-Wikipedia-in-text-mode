 "text": "Peritoneal dialysis is a method of treating kidney failure by utilizing the peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen, to internally filter the blood. Before commencing peritoneal dialysis, a surgeon inserts a soft tube called a catheter into the belly. During the treatment, a dialysis solution consisting of water, salt, and other additives is introduced into the belly through the catheter from a bag. Once the bag is empty, it is disconnected, and a cap is placed on the catheter, allowing the individual to freely move around and engage in normal activities. While inside the belly, the dialysis solution absorbs waste and excess fluid from the body. A diagram illustrating peritoneal dialysis showcases the connection between the bag of dialysis solution and the catheter entering the abdominal cavity, highlighting the peritoneum. After a few hours, the solution, along with the accumulated waste, is drained from the belly into an empty bag. The used solution can be disposed of in a toilet or tub. The process is then repeated with a fresh bag of dialysis solution. Fresh solution exhibits a higher efficiency in waste absorption, but over time, its filtering ability decreases. Hence, the process of emptying the used solution and refilling the belly with fresh solution needs to be repeated four to six times daily, which is referred to as an exchange. Exchanges can be performed during the day or at night using a machine that facilitates fluid pumping in and out. It is crucial to adhere to the prescribed exchange regimen for optimal outcomes. While dialysis can enhance well-being and prolong life, it does not serve as a cure for kidney failure. Category:Medical procedures",
