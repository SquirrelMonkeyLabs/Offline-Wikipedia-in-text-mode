 "text": "Metallica (also known informally as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1991 by Elektra Records. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the band's first album to do so. Currently, it has sold over 15 million copies in the United States alone. It is the band's most successful album. ==Recording and production== The recording of Metallica was troubled. It was the first time the band had worked with producer Bob Rock. Him and the band often came into conflict with one another. Ulrich, Hammett and Newsted also got divorces with their wives because of the stress. Four demos of the album were recorded on September 13, 1990; \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Wherever I May Roam\". The lead single Enter Sandman was the first song written. Despite this, it was the last to receive lyrics. ==Musical style and lyrics== The album was seen as a departure from the thrash and speed metal of the first four albums. It has slower tempos and a more straightforward heavy metal sound. Despite this, there is still some characteristics of thrash metal. Metallica has also been described as hard rock and groove metal. Many fans see the album as the dividing point between \"old\" and \"new\" Metallica. The lyrics of Metallica were written by James Hetfield. They're more personal and introspective than the band's previous albums. Bob Rock said Hetfield's songwriting became more confident. His lyrics were inspired by the likes of Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, and John Lennon. According to Chris True of AllMusic, \"Enter Sandman\", for example, is about \"nightmares and all that come with them\". Hetfield said the album's lyrics were more introspective due to him wanting \"lyrics that the band could stand behind – but we are four completely different individuals. So the only way to go was in.\" ==Release and reception== Five singles were released from the album: \"Enter Sandman\", \"The Unforgiven\", \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Sad but True\". Of them, the best-selling was \"Enter Sandman\". It won Best Metal Video at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. The song \"Don't Tread on Me\" was also issued to rock radio shortly after the album's release. Despite this, it never saw a commercial single release. Metallica is the band's best-selling album. Over 30 million copies sold worldwide. It debuted at number one in ten countries. It also spent four consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200. The album was Metallica's first to top the album charts. It also won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1992. Metallica is one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It's also one of the best-selling albums in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began. It was certified 16× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012. == Track listing == # \"Enter Sandman\" - 5:29 # \"Sad But True\" - 5:24 # \"Holier Than Thou\" - 3:47 # \"The Unforgiven\" - 6:26 # \"Wherever I May Roam\" - 6:42 # \"Don't Tread On Me\" - 3:59 # \"Through the Never\" - 4:01 # \"Nothing Else Matters\" - 6:29 # \"Of Wolf And Man\" - 4:16 # \"The God That Failed\" - 5:05 # \"My Friend of Misery\" - 6:47 # \"The Struggle Within\" - 3:51 == References == Category:Metallica albums Category:1991 albums Category:Grammy Award-winning albums",
