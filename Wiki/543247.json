 "text": "An acid-base reaction is a chemical reaction between an acid and a base. The products of such a reaction are a salt and water. This reaction may also regarded as neutralization reaction. The reaction can be simplified to :(aq) + (aq) → The other ions remain constant because they are not affected by the reaction. They are called spectator ions. == Acids and oxides == An example of an acid-oxide reaction is sulfuric acid and copper(II) oxide reacting to form copper sulfate and water: :H2SO4 \\+ CuO —> CuSO4 \\+ H2O Another example of an acid-oxide reaction is nitric acid reacting with sodium oxide to form sodium nitrate and water: :2 HNO3 \\+ Na2O —> 2 NaNO3 \\+ H2O The general equation is: :acid + oxide = salt + water == Acids and hydroxides == This is one of the more common acid-base reactions. This reaction is one of the few processes to make sodium chloride using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide: :HCl + NaOH —> NaCl + H2O == Acids and carbonates == An acid can also react with a carbonate, which is a relatively weak base. An example is acetic acid reacting with calcium carbonate to form calcium acetate, carbon dioxide and water: : 2 CH3COOH + CaCO3 —> Ca(CH3COO)2 \\+ CO2 \\+ H2O The products of an acid-carbonate reaction is a soluble salt, carbon dioxide and water.
