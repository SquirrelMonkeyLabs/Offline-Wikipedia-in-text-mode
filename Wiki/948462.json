 "text": "The Pacific Northwest Indian War (1786â€“1795) was a war between Native Americans of the Northwest Indian Confederacy and the United States. The war was about who should control the Northwest Territory. This territory included the current states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. It is considered the first war of the American Indian Wars. The United States lost several battles. Eventually, the Americans won and defeated the Native Americans. The United States got the land of the Northwest Territory from Great Britain. This land was part of the Treaty of Paris (1783) after the American Revolution. There were several defeats for the Americans. They include Harmar campaign (1790) and St. Clair's defeat (1791). St. Clair's defeat was a major defeat for the Americans. It is perhaps the greatest defeat in American military history.Landon Y. Jones (2005). William Clark and the Shaping of the West. p. 41. ISBN 9781429945363. Many American soldiers died. General Washington created a larger army. He made Anthony Wayne the new General. Americans won the last battle. This battle was the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Natives had to give up their land in Ohio in the Treaty of Greenville (1795). In the Jay Treaty (1795), Natives gave up the lands around the British Great Lakes. == Key People == === United States === * Henry Knox, first United States Secretary of War * Josiah Harmar, Brigadier General in command of the First American Regiment who led the 1790 Harmar campaign * Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory and Major General at St. Clair's defeat * Anthony Wayne, Major General in command of Legion of the United States at the Battle of Fallen Timbers * Charles Scott, Brigadier General commanding the Kentucky militia during Wayne's campaign * James Wilkinson, Lieutenant Colonel in command of Fort Washington, Wayne's second in command and Spanish spy === United Indian Nations === * Little Turtle (Miami) * Blue Jacket (Shawnee) * Buckongahelas (Delaware) * Roundhead, (or Stayeghtha) (Wyandot) * Egushawa (Odawa) * Joseph Brant (Mohawk) === British Empire === * Sir Guy Carleton, Lord Dorchester Commander-in-Chief of British North America * William Campbell, British Major in command of Fort Miamis * John Graves Simcoe Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada * Alexander McKee Deputy Agent and later Deputy Superintendent General in the British Indian Department ==References== Category:History of Native Americans Category:1780s in the United States Category:1790s in the United States __NOTOC__",
