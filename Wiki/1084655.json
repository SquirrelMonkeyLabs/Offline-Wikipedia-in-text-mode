 "text": "The Nicobarese tree frog or Nicobar tree frog (Polypedates insularis) is a frog. It lives in India on the Nicobar Islands. People have seen it as high as 500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees in forests, but they can also live in gardens, farms, and houses. This frog lives on Great Nicobar, Little Nicobar, and Pulo Milo. Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out because the place it lives is not very big. People are planning to build a place for ships on Great Nicobar. If they do, much of the place where the frog lives will be gone. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
