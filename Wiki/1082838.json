 "text": "The Dai Le and Frank Carbone Network (DLFCN) is an Australian political party that was founded in 2023 by federal MP Dai Le and Fairfield Mayor Frank Carbone. It was founded as a local party for Greater Western Sydney, a region where the Labor Party is usually dominant depending on what is considered \"Western Sydney\". It was also founded to oppose the rise of teal independents in the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. The party plans to run candidates in many seats in Western Sydney at the next federal election.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/fairfield-mayor-frank- carbone-and-fowler-mp-dai-le-to-form-western-sydneyfocused-antiteals- party/news-story/5e6a9eb673b5b8d921dc0e9b758fd0ac Dai Le is the current member for the seat of Fowler, a traditionally Labor-held seat that she won as an independent in 2022. She used to be a Liberal councillor on the Fairfield City Council, but in 2016 she was suspended from the party for 10 years after she decided to run for Mayor against the endorsed Liberal candidate. Frank Carbone is the current Mayor of Fairfield. He used to be a member of the Labor Party before he left to become an independent in 2016. Carbone originally thought of naming the party \"A Western Voice\".https://web.archive.org/web/20230509142312/https://www.2gb.com/fairfield- mayor-and-independent-mp-launch-party-for-western-sydney/ ==References== Category:Greater Western Sydney Category:Political parties in New South Wales Category:Politics of Sydney",
