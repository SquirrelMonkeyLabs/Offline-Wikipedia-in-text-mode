 "text": "The fanfin angler, scientifically known as Caulophryne jordani, is a species of anglerfish. It lives in deep sea water. It is known for its unusual tentacles with bioluminescent tips and for the spine above its eyes with a fleshy growth used to lure prey. They live in the bathyal zone at depths between . == History == They are part of about 160 known species of deep-sea anglerfishes found in all oceans around the world. However, they are extremely rare. Only 14 females have been documented in natural history collections. == Habitat == Fanfin anglers are found in the deep, lightless waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. They live in midwater zones at depths typically between , where sunlight does not reach. == Feeding == These anglerfish have a unique hunting strategy. They have a bioluminescent lure that attracts fishes and other deep-sea animals. The light is produced not by the fish itself but by bacteria living inside the lure. This symbiotic relationship allows the fanfin angler to hunt in complete darkness. The fanfin angler mostly eats crustaceans and smaller fishes. It uses its bioluminescent lure to attract these prey items in the deep sea's dark environment. The light from the lure, produced by symbiotic bacteria, brings prey close enough for the anglerfish to capture them. == Adaptations == Fanfin anglers are adapted to a life in constant darkness. They do not have the expanded escal bulb found in other anglerfishes. Instead, they have very long dorsal and anal fin rays which move independently, helping them move. Their tiny eyes are almost useless for spotting prey, so they rely heavily on their bioluminescence to attract food sources. ==References== Category:Bioluminescent animals Category:Teleosts",
