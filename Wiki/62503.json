 "text": "Bentheuphausia amblyops is a species of krill. Krill are small shrimp-like crustaceans living in the ocean. B. amblyops is the only species within its genus, which in turn is the only genus within the family Bentheuphausiidae. All the 85 other species of krill known are classified in the family Euphausiidae. B. amblyops can be found in the northern Atlantic Ocean. It occurs in latitudes south of 40Â° N, and also in the southern seas of the Atlantic, in the Indian Ocean and in the Pacific. It is a bathypelagic krill that lives in deep waters below 1,000 m. It is distinguished from the Euphausiidae by several morphological features. The features most easily used to tell it apart are that the animals are not bioluminescent and that their first pair of pleopods is not modified as copulatory tool organs. Also, their eyes are smaller than those of the Euphausiidae. Adults reach a length of 4 to 5 cm. == References == *Taxonomy of Bentheuphausia amblyops from ITIS. * Distribution data set of Bentheuphausia ambylops from OBIS. * Australian Faunal Directory entry for Bentheuphausia amblyops. *Mauchline, J.: Euphausiacea: Adults , Conseil International pour l'Exploration de la Mer, 1971. *Sars, G.
