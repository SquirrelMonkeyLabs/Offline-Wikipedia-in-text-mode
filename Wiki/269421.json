The basilisk is part of the corytophanid family. It is also known as the Jesus Christ lizard because of its ability to run on the surface of water. == Walking on water == This lizard can walk on water. When a land predator attacks, they gather sufficient momentum and start running on water to escape. This is a reference to the story in which Jesus walks on water. == Related pages == * Orthocormus * Euthynotus * Basiliscus Category:Iguania Category:Reptiles of South America Category:Reptiles of North America",
