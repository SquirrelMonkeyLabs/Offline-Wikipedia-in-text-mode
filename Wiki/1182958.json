The word was later popularized by social media. ==Causes== The most common causes for why ghosting happens are: * Political differences * Avoidance of emotional discomfort * Hook-up culture making it easier for contact to be cut without consequences * * * ==Prevalence== In 2014, a YouGov survey was done to see if Americans had ever ghosted their partner to end a relationship. In that survey, 1,000 US adults were interviewed about ghosting, yielding the result that just over 10% of Americans had ghosted someone to break up with them. ==Issues== Psychologists are critical of ghosting as a behavior, classifying it as passive-aggressive behavior, which is a form of emotional abuse. ==Related pages== * Social rejection * Psychopathology * Personality disorder ==References== Category:Relationships Category:Antisocial personality disorder",
