 "text": "Epic Mickey is a platform video game for the Nintendo Wii game console. It was developed by Junction Point Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios. It was released in Europe on November 26, 2010, in North America on November 30, 2010, and in Japan on August 4, 2011. The game stars Mickey Mouse, who accidentally damages a world of forgotten Disney characters and concepts. He uses a magic paintbrush to fight enemies. The game is intended to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by focusing his adventurous side rather than his pleasant, cheerful side, doing so by showing him as an heroic character. The game is darker and more complex than previous Mickey Mouse games. It features the first appearance of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's first successful cartoon character, as a major character since 1943. A sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, was released for the Wii, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in 2012. And also Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion release in 2013, for Nintendo 3DS. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official U.S. website *Official UK Website Category:2010 video games Category:3D platformers Category:Action-adventure games Category:Crossover video games Category:Disney video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Metafictional video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Post- apocalyptic video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about rabbits and hares Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
