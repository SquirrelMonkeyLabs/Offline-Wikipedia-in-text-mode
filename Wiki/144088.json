 "text": "North Ayrshire (Gaelic: Siorrachd Inbhir Ã€ir a Tuath, ) is one of 32 council areas of Scotland. It borders onto the areas of Inverclyde to the north, Renfrewshire to the north east, and East Ayrshire, and South Ayrshire to the East and South respectively. The area was created in 1996 as a successor to the district of Cunninghame which covered exactly the same boundaries. The mainland portion of the council area has historically been part of a greater County of Ayr, however it also contains the islands of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae in the lower Firth of Clyde. All the islands were previously in the County of Bute. == Towns and villages == === Mainland === * Ardrossan * Barrmill * Benslie * Bourtreehill * Beith * Chapeltoun * Cunninghamhead * Dalry * Dreghorn * Fairlie * Fergushill * Gateside, North Ayrshire * Girdle Toll * Hessilhead * Irvine * Kilbirnie * Kilwinning * Largs * Perceton * Portencross * Saltcoats * Seamill * Skelmorlie * Springside * Stevenston * West Kilbride === Arran === * Brodick * Blackwaterfoot * Lamlash * Lochranza === The Cumbraes === * Millport == Education == === Secondary Schools In North Ayrshire === * Ardrossan Academy, Ardrossan * St Andrew's Academy, Saltcoats (merged to form St Matthew's Academy) * Kilwinning Academy, Kilwinning * St Michael's Academy, Kilwinning (merged to form St Matthew's Academy) * Greenwood Academy, Irvine * Irvine Royal Academy, Irvine * Auchenharvie Academy, Stevenston * Largs Academy, Largs * St Matthew's Academy, Saltcoats * Garnock Academy == Places of Interest == * Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park * Eglinton Country Park, Irvine * Eglinton Tournament Bridge == Other websites == * Ardrossan Academy website Category:1996 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1990s establishments in Scotland",
