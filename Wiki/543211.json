The sculpture, made in 1753, is considered one of the world's masterpieces. Antonio Canova who once tried to acquire the work declared that he would willingly give up ten years of his own life to produce a similar masterpiece. == History and description == The order for the Veiled Christ was given to Antonio Corradini. However, he died a short time later. Sanmartino took over the work. He decided to place the Christ figure on a couch, covered by a veil. It was to show the suffering that Christ has undergone. At the sculpture's feet, finally, the artist also carves the instruments of his torture: the crown of thorns, pliers, and some shackles. == Legend of the veil == An analysis shows that the work is completely made in marble. A receipt of payment to Sanmartino dated 16 December 1752, signed by the prince, is preserved in the historical archive of the Bank of Naples. It states: == References == * Elio Catello, Giuseppe Sanmartino (1720-1793), Napoli, Electa, 2004. == Other websites == * Official website of the Museum of the Cappella Sansevero Category:Sculptures Category:1750s works Category:18th century in art",
