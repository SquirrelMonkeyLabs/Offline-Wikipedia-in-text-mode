 "text": "Cognition is the scientific word for the mental processes including perception, memory, and thought. Cognition is the gaining of knowledge and understanding. The word comes from the Latin word cognoscere, which means \"to know\" or \"to recognize\". How knowledge is gained is a major part of philosophy called epistemology. Cognitive psychology studies mental processes to explain human behavior. Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind that combines psychology, brain sciences, and other fields of study. Cognitive linguistics studies how language influences thought. ==Early studies == Some of the work of Aristotle (d. 322 BC) had focus on memory, perception, and mental imagery (or imagery created by the mind). John Locke and Dugald Stewart tried to develop a model of the mind; In that model, ideas were acquired (or gotten), remembered and (later changed or) manipulated. In Britain, further work was done by scholars such as James Sully, and some of that work was used by lawmakers in 1870. Early theorists were *Wilhelm Wundt (d. 1920), known for work about introspection *Hermann Ebbinghaus (d. 1909) Mary Whiton Calkins (d. 1930) William James (d. 1910) Ren√© Descartes (d. 1650) ==Later== Ulrik Neisser did work regarding cognitive psychology. ==Jean Piaget== Cognition learning theory is the idea of processing information and memory from your surroundings. This was founded by Jean Piaget. Jean Piaget was a psychologist who focused on child development. Human cognitive development is what he developed. He was interested in biology and species in their environment. Cognitive learning theory focuses on processing information in your mind and is one of the most flexible theories out of the five other theories. Cognition is psychology that is the process of thinking. It is the mental action of knowledge and understanding through experience, senses, and how we think. Reasoning, problem solving, and decision making is linked with cognitive. Human cognition involves outside of our control and from our own control. It is the process of knowledge and new knowledge. ==References==",
