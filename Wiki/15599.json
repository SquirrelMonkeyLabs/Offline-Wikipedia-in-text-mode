 "text": "Sexism is generally defined as the bias, prejudice or discrimination against someone on the basis of gender, i.e. looking down on a person for being male or female. ==Overview== Sexism may also include stereotyped roles by gender. International laws, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women or Yogyakarta Principles, demand the end of every form of sexism. Sexism can affect a person attending a party, getting a job, joining a game, trying to get a promotion, being selected and so on. Sexism is often discrimination against women due to the history of sexism in the Western world. ==Origin== The word sexism was created by Pauline M. Leet on November 18, 1965. ==Misogyny== Misogyny refers to the bias, prejudice or discrimination against women. ==Misandry== Misandry refers to the bias, prejudice or discrimination against men. * * * * * Misandry's existence is denied by a significant proportion of feminists. Feminists tend to see men as \"inherently responsible\" for the patriarchy, leading many to form the impression that men's suffering has not been given equal attention, while men in Western world are three to four times more likely to die by suicide. ==Gendered racism== Gendered racism is a form of oppression that happens due to stereotypes related to race and gender. * Anderson, M.L., & Collins, P.H.

While many engage in racism to divide others into \"superior\" and \"inferior\" to treat them differently, sexism is the prejudice or discrimination based on sex, e.g. bias against women. As a hybrid, gendered racism is related to racial understandings of masculinity and femininity, e.g. bias against women of a certain ethnic group based on their customs. The word was coined by Dutch-Surinamese sociologist Philomena Essed (1955 ‒ ) to refer to women facing racism and sexism at the same time. Essed said, Those subject to gendered racism often find it hard to know whether others are biased against them because of their race or gender, or both. Nevertheless, both the race and gender of a person is said to intersect to form his or her identity, whose lived experience is suggested to be analyzed based on both their race and gender. ==Civil rights movements== The women's rights and men's rights movements both claim to be fighting sexism. ==Education== World literacy is lower for women than for men. On October 9, 2012, the Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head on her schoolbus by Taliban gunmen because she did activism for girls' rights to education. ==Related pages== * Sex segregation * Feminization of poverty * Men's rights movement * Violence against women * Women's rights movement * Discrimination against non-binary people ==References== Category:Gender Category:Discrimination",
