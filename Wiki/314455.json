 "text": "Jacques Lacan (Paris, 13 April 1901 â€“ Paris, 9 September 1981) was a French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist. He added new ideas to psychoanalysis and philosophy. Some of these ideas are the mirror stage, the three orders of subjectivity (the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real), the object little a and jouissance. He talked every year at seminars from 1953 to 1981. In the 1960s and 1970s, he influenced many French intellectuals. He also talked about going back to the ideas of Sigmund Freud. He called himself a Freudian (follower of Freud).David Macey, \"Introduction\", Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (London 1994) p. xxxiii ==References== Category:French psychiatrists Category:1901 births Category:1981 deaths",
