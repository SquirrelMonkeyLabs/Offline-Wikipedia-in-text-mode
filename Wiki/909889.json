Retrieved 30 August 2021 Built between 1879 and 1881, it is about long. It climbs from about above sea level at New Jalpaiguri to about at Darjeeling, using six zig zags and five loops to gain altitude. Six diesel locomotives move most of the scheduled service, with daily tourist trains from Darjeeling to Ghum – India's highest railway station – and the steam-hauled Red Panda service from Darjeeling to Kurseong. Steam train specials are hauled by older British-built B-Class steam locomotives. The railway's headquarters are at Kurseong. On 5 December 1999, UNESCO named the DHR a World Heritage Site. Two more railway lines were later added, and the site became known as one of the mountain railways of India. == References == Category:Darjeeling district Category:Rail transport in India Category:World Heritage Sites in India",
