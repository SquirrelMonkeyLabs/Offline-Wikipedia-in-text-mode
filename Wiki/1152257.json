The Wars continued till the regin of Ahmad Shah II of Bahmani Sultanate and Dev Raya II of the Vijayanagara Empire . In the final battle fought between these two in 1443 the latter was defeated ending the 81 year Conflict between the two. ==The Wars== ===The First Vijayangara–Bahmani War=== The First Vijayangara–Bahmani War was fought between Muhammad Shah I of Bahmani Sultanate and Bukka Raya I of the Vijayanagara Empire. Bukka Raya, aware of the threat from Sultan Muhammad Shah, sent his treasures to Vijayanagar and prepared for battle. The next day, heavy rainfall bogged down his army, which gave the Sultan an opportunity to advance. Bukka, realizing he couldn't win, fled to the fortress of Adoni, leaving his forces behind. Muhammad Shah then plundered the Vijayanagar camp, killing tens of thousands, and recaptured Mudgal. Bukka set up his headquarters in Adoni and sent his general Mallinatha to fight the Bahmanis. Mallinatha, confident of victory, planned to capture the Sultan. The Bahmanis, led by Muhammad Shah, moved into Vijayanagar territory, and a battle took place on July 20, 1366. Despite initial successes by the Vijayanagar forces, Muhammad Shah's timely arrival turned the tide. Mallinatha was killed, and the Vijayanagar army was defeated. Afterward, Bukka used guerrilla tactics to harass the Bahmanis, but Muhammad Shah eventually laid siege to Vijayanagar. Bukka's forces suffered another defeat, and the Sultan began plundering the city, killing hundreds of thousands, including many Brahmins. The devastation was so great that it took decades for the region to recover. Eventually, Bukka sought peace, and Muhammad Shah agreed after a payment was made. ===The Second Vijayanagara–Bahmani War=== In 1375, Bukka Raya of Vijayanagar went to war with Sultan Mujahid of the Bahmani Sultanate over control of land in the Doab region. Despite a peace treaty in 1368, tensions remained. Mujahid wanted Bukka to give up control of certain territories, but Bukka refused, claiming ancestral lands and demanding Mujahid withdraw. Mujahid's army attacked, and Bukka used his usual tactic of avoiding direct battles, retreating into the hills. For months, Bukka avoided capture while Mujahid's forces destroyed villages. Eventually, Bukka returned to defend Vijayanagar, and Mujahid's army laid siege to the city. After initial successes, the arrival of Bukka's reinforcements pushed back the Bahmani forces. Mujahid withdrew and laid siege to Adoni instead, but the rainy season helped the defenders. Unable to win, Mujahid eventually agreed to peace, and both sides retreated. ===The Third Vijayanagara–Bahmani War=== Harihara II of Vijayanagar took advantage of the Bahmanis' internal struggles by forming an alliance with Katya Vema of Rajamundry. He then attacked the Raichur Doab with an army of 30,000 cavalry and 900,000 troops. Meanwhile, Prince Bukka II subdued the Velama chiefs of Telangana, who were allied with the Bahmanis. Firuz Shah of the Bahmanis was forced to defend the Raichur Doab with only 12,000 cavalry. His army was spread thin, and a flood in the Krishna River stopped both sides from crossing. Frustrated by the stalemate, Firuz's officer, Qazi Sirajuddin, proposed a risky plan to infiltrate the Vijayanagar camp disguised as performers. Sirajuddin and his group crossed the river, assassinated Prince Harihara’s son, and caused confusion within the Vijayanagar camp. This chaos allowed a small Bahmani force to attack and drive the Vijayanagar army back. Firuz did not lay siege to Vijayanagar but instead negotiated a treaty. Harihara had to pay a large ransom for the captured prisoners, including 10,000 Brahmins, and agreed to pay an annual tribute of thirty-three lakhs of tankas to the Bahmanis. ===The Fourth Vijayanagara–Bahmani War=== After Faulad Khan repelled Vijayanagar forces, Firuz Shah prepared for war. He gathered a large army, including key generals, and crossed the Tungabhadra River with support from Hindu allies like the Reddis and Anapota Velama. Deva Raya of Vijayanagar retreated to his capital, but Firuz captured the suburbs and parts of the city, though he couldn't reach the palace. Firuz was injured and retreated but continued to win battles, capturing important forts like Bankapur and gaining control of valuable land. Deva Raya struggled to get reinforcements, and the Reddis advanced in the east. After months of fighting, Deva Raya realized he couldn't defeat Firuz and sent envoys to discuss peace. Firuz initially refused but later agreed to negotiate, as his advisors urged him to seek peace and return to his kingdom. Deva Raya was willing to accept Firuz’s terms. ===The Fifth Vijayangara-Bahmani War=== Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah of the Bahmani Sultanate laid siege to the fort of Pangal, controlled by the Recherla Nayakas, for two years. However, a disease outbreak weakened his forces, leading to failure in capturing the fort and heavy losses. Seizing the opportunity, Devaraya I, the king of Vijayanagar, sought revenge for past humiliations. He attacked the weakened Bahmani army, aided by fresh forces and Hindu chiefs. The besieging army was surrounded, and the garrison launched a successful counterattack. The Bahmani forces were defeated, and Sultan Feroz fled. After this defeat, Devaraya I retaliated by massacring Muslims and displaying their heads on a platform. His forces continued to devastate Bahmani lands, destroying mosques and killing civilians, including in regions like Konkan. In desperation, Sultan Feroz sought help from the Sultan of Gujarat but received no assistance. ===The sixth Vijayangara-Bahmani War=== After 40 days of trying to provoke battle, Ahmad took action by sending 10,000 soldiers under Rana Ugrasen Bhonsale to attack the Vijayanagar army's flank. However, the Vijayanagar forces retreated, and their king, Vira Vijaya, was captured by Bahmani troops, who mistook him for a gardener. With the Vijayanagar army leaderless, Ahmad's troops looted their camp. Although the king escaped, he chose not to rally his army and instead fled to Vijayanagar. Seeking revenge for past atrocities, Ahmad marched through the Vijayanagar kingdom, killing men and enslaving women and children. He also destroyed temples and slaughtered cows to hurt the Vijayanagar's religious beliefs. During a hunting trip, Ahmad was ambushed by Vijayanagar soldiers but was defended by his bodyguard, Rana Ugrasen Bhonsale, until reinforcements arrived. Impressed by this defense, Ahmad recruited 3,000 foreign archers. In March 1423, Ahmad was again attacked by 5,000 Vijayanagar horsemen but was protected by his archers and bodyguard until reinforcements arrived, causing the Vijayanagar forces to flee. Ahmad then marched toward Vijayanagar, and the king, seeing the destruction, asked for peace and accepted Ahmad's terms. ===The seventh Vijayangara-Bahmani War=== Deva Raya aimed to reclaim the Raichur Doab, sending his sons to Raichur and Bankapur while he took Mudgal. He raided Bahmani lands, causing destruction up to Sagar and Bijapur. The Bahmani Sultan, worried, sent an army under Khalaf Hasan to relieve Raichur and defeated Deva Raya’s son there. Meanwhile, Deva Raya’s other son was defeated at Bankapur. Deva Raya and the Bahmani forces clashed at Mudgal. The Vijayanagara forces initially won, but after two months, the Bahmani forces triumphed, killing Deva Raya's eldest son. Deva Raya captured two Bahmani officers, but after being threatened with mass retribution, he agreed to peace. ==List of Battles== Conflict Vijayanagara Bahmani Result Battle of Mudgal (1366) Vijayangara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory Battle of Kauthal (1366) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory Siege of Vijayanagar Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory Siege of Vijayanagar(1378) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Indecisive Battle of Krishna river (1398) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory Battle of Vijayanagar (1406) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory Siege of Pangul (1418-1420) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Vijayanagara victory Siege of Vijayanagar (1423) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory Battle of Mudgal (1443) Vijayanagara Empire Bahmani Sultanate Bahmani victory == References == Category:Vijayanagara Empire",
