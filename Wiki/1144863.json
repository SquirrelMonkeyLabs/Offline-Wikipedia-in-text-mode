He succeeded his brother Hariharrao Patwardhan who died as a minor in the early 1780s (probably late 1782/early 1783) at the age of about 7. While he was away, rumours started that he died and therefore his uncle, Gangadharrao crowned himself as Raja of Miraj. When Raja Chintamanrao returned he was angry and left the state with only an idol of Lord Ganesha and he vowed to set up another Capital for his Jagir, and thus he became the first Ruler of Sangli. His state later became a British Protectorate. He established the well known Ganapati Panchayatan Sansthan Temple as per his vow to his family Deity, and the Ganesh Durg Palace in 1801, he was regarded even by his foes as an enlightened, valoursome and a compassionate Ruler, he encouraged the development of trade and commerce in Sangli and established trade districts known as Peths. He started a printing press in 1821/1822 in Sangli, the first of its kind in the state. He married and had issue, as well as an adopted son (Dhundi Rao Chintaman Rao). He died on 15 July 1851 at the age of about 75. == References == Category:1776 births Category:1851 deaths Category:Indian royalty",
