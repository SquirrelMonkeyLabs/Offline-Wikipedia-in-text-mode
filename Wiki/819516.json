The district is currently represented by Republican Steve Chabot. The district was once represented by the 9th President of the United States, William Henry Harrison. William Henry Harrison represented the district before he was president. The district includes the cities of Cheviot, Forest Park, Franklin, Harrison, Indian Hill, Springdale, St. Bernard, Mason, Lebanon, Sharonville, and Carlisle. A small part of Cincinnati is also in the district. Some people believe that the Republicans used gerrymandering when making the district so Steve Chabot could win the elections easier. ==Election history== ==References== Category:Geography of Ohio",
