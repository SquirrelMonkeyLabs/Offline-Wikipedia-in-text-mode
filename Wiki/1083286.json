 "text": "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny\", often shortened to \"The Ultimate Showdown\", is a comical song and video released on December 22, 2005. The song was written and performed by Neil Cicierega under the pseudonym Lemon Demon, appearing as the fifth single of the project's fifth studio album Dinosaurchestra. The song describes a massive and citywide battle set in Tokyo started by Godzilla and Batman, involving dozens of pop-culture icons and ultimately lasting for a century. The music video's animation made by Shawn Vulliez. == Background == In the early 2000s, Neil Cicierega popularized animutation, a form of flash animation that humorously depicts pop-culture images set to upbeat music. Steven Lerner, the owner of Albino Blacksheep, later stated that as the genre grew more popular it had begun to advance in effort, with creators drawing the characters rather than editing publicly available photos. Cicierega adapted to this development, publishing the song \"The Ultimate Showdown\" to Newgrounds on December 22, 2005, with Shawn Vulliez credited for the video's animation under the name altffour. The song was additionally released under the full name \"The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny\" as the fifth single of Lemon Demon's fifth studio album Dinosaurchestra, which came out on July 20, 2006. == Reception == \"The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny\" gained a large cult following among web enthusiasts. It ranked on Newgrounds as the \"User's Choice\" upon publication, amassing 6.5 million views within its first six months of release. It appeared on several other websites including Albino Blacksheep and YouTube, receiving over 25 million views on the latter before a takedown and replacement by Vulliez in early 2021. A higher resolution fan upload has received over 9 million views on YouTube as of March 2025. The song topped the \"Funny Five\" on The Dr. Demento Show for several weeks and was the #1 request for 2006. In 2009, the song was re-recorded with a full band, receiving inclusion on the compilation Almanac 2009 and Lemon Demon's first EP Live (Only Not) (2011). It additionally appeared on the Rock Band Network, releasing to the service on July 6, 2010. == Plot == While most of the characters named in the song are fictional, several real people are also described as combatants. Top: Shaquille O'Neal, Aaron Carter, Abraham Lincoln. Middle: Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris, Benito Mussolini. Bottom: Dwayne Johnson, Hulk Hogan, Fred Rogers. As Godzilla is going on a rampage through Tokyo, Batman surprise attacks him with a Bat-Grenade. Godzilla's attempt to retaliate is blocked by Shaquille O'Neal, who is attacked by Aaron Carter until Batman runs over them both with the Batmobile. Before Batman can return to the Batcave, Abraham Lincoln rises from the dead and shoots Batman with an AK-47. Lincoln is then forced to flee by Optimus Prime. After Godzilla eats a piece of Optimus Prime, O'Neal returns but is then attacked by Jackie Chan. Meanwhile, Lincoln attempts to finish off Batman with a machete but is stopped by Indiana Jones. Jones is left defenseless against Godzilla as Batman steals his gun and unsuccessfully attempts to kill Chan. A somersaulting Chan and Lincoln, attempting to pole- vault onto Optimus Prime, collide in midair and are struck down by a Care Bear stare. Chuck Norris, presented as a godlike figure, descends from the sky to angelic tones, kicks Indiana Jones in the groin, and crushes Batman's head with his thighs. Dozens of additional heroes and villains, including the historical Benito Mussolini, all arrive and kill Norris. Approximately a century later, the battle has officially ended and is implied to have claimed the lives of many more characters besides those mentioned, with only one contestant remaining: Mister Rogers. The music video additionally features Rogers raising a katana in victory before committing seppuku with it. == Characters == * Godzilla * Batman/Bruce Wayne * Shaquille O'Neal * Aaron Carter * Abraham Lincoln * Optimus Prime * Jackie Chan * Indiana Jones * A Care Bear * Chuck Norris * Gandalf the Grey * Gandalf the White * Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight * Benito Mussolini * The Blue Meanie * Cowboy Curtis * Jambi the Genie * RoboCop * The Terminator * Captain Kirk * Darth Vader * Lo Pan * Superman * Every single Power Ranger * Bill S.

Old Godzilla was hopping around Tokyo City like a big playground When suddenly Batman burst from the shade And hit Godzilla with a Batgrenade Godzilla got pissed and began to attack But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq-Fu When Aaron Carter came out of the blue And he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile But before it could make it back to the Batcave Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave And took an AK-47 out from under his hat And blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat But he ran out of bullets and he ran away Because Optimus Prime came to save the day This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back And Batman was injured, and trying to get steady When Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped Indiana Jones took him out with his whip Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find 'Cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed And Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist Then he jumped in the air and did a somersault While Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault Onto Optimus Prime, but they collided in the air Then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be This is the ultimate showdown Angels sang out an immaculate chorus Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris Who delivered a kick which could shatter bones Into the crotch of Indiana Jones Who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain As Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne But Chuck saw through his clever disguise And he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs Then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's black knight And Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie And Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader Lo-pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan All came out of nowhere lightning fast And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw With civilians looking on in total awe The fight raged on for a century Many lives were claimed, but eventually The champion stood, the rest saw their better Mr. Rogers in a bloodstained sweater This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny Good guys, bad guys, and explosions as far as the eye can see And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be This is the ultimate showdown (The ultimate showdown) This is the ultimate showdown (The ultimate showdown) This is the ultimate showdown Of ultimate destiny\" For the Video Go here ---> https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/285267 Category:2005 songs Category:Comedy",
