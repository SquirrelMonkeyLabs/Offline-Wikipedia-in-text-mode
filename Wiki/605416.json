 "text": "Dublin is a suburban city in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. It is in Alameda County, about 23 miles (37 km) east of Oakland, and 35 miles (56 km) east of San Francisco. Dublin's population was 72,589 in the year 2020. == History == The first farmer in the area was José María Amador. He got the land from the Mexican government in 1835. Over time, other people bought land, and created a village. It was named for Dublin, Ireland because many Irish people lived in it. During World War II, the US Navy built Camp Parks to the east of Dublin. It was a base for the Navy's Construction Battalion (also called Seabees). Camp Parks was given to the Air Force in 1952. Since 1959, it is used by the Army. Santa Rita Jail was also built on this land. Dublin was a small town until the 1960s. At that time, land developers started building many houses. Dublin became a suburb: people would live there but work in other cities. It incorporated as a city in 1982. From 2010 to 2020, Dublin was the fastest growing city in California. Most of the growth was from Asian Americans. In 10 years, the number of Asian Americans in Dublin grew from 12,000 to 39,000. A federal women's prison, FCI Dublin, was shut down in 2024. Many employees were convicted of sexually abusing prisoners. The US government agreed to pay over 100 million dollars to the victims. == Geography == Dublin has an area of 15 square miles (39 km²). It shares borders with San Ramon to the north and Pleasanton to the south. Dublin and Pleasanton are in the Amador Valley (named for José María Amador). The Amador, Livermore, and San Ramon valleys make the Tri-Valley. Dublin is separated from the San Francisco Bay by hills, so it is warmer and drier than the cities near the bay. == People == In the 2020 census, there were 72,589 people living in Dublin, in 23,526 households.
