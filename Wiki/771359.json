 "text": "The Lower Peninsula of Michigan – also known as Lower Michigan – is the southern and less elevated of the two major landmasses that make up the U.S. state of Michigan, the other being the Upper Peninsula. It is surrounded by water on all sides except its southern border, which it shares with Indiana and Ohio. Although the Upper Peninsula is commonly referred to as \"the U.P.\", it is uncommon for the Lower Peninsula to be called \"the L.P.\" ==References== Category:Geography of Michigan Category:Peninsulas of the United States",
