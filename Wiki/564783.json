 "text": "Terza rima is a three-line rhyme scheme of Italian origin.Claudio Ciociola, Terza rima at Enciclopedia dell'italiano (in Italian). The first line rhymes with the third one. The second line is free and can rhyme with a line in the next strophe. Terza rima occurs in sonnets. Sonnets are often composed of two quatrains and two terza rimas, for example abba abba cdc dcd. This scheme can be found in many Italian, Spanish and Portuguese sonnets. This sonnet by the 16th century Portuguese poet Francisco de Sá de Miranda is a good example. O sol é grande, caem co’a calma as aves, do tempo em tal sazão, que sói ser fria; esta água que d’alto cai acordar-m’-ia do sono não, mas de cuidados graves. Ó cousas, todas vãs, todas mudaves, qual é tal coração qu’em vós confia? Passam os tempos vai dia trás dia, incertos muito mais que ao vento as naves. Eu vira já aqui sombras, vira flores, vi tantas águas, vi tanta verdura, as aves todas cantavam d’amores. Tudo é seco e mudo; e, de mestura, também mudando-m’eu fiz doutras cores: e tudo o mais renova, isto é sem cura!Francisco Sá de Miranda, O sol é grande, caem co’a calma as aves at Citador (in Portuguese). Usually terza rimas are linked to each other making long chain-like sequences. There is an extra line at the end of the sequence.

Perhaps every child in Italy knows these lines by heart. Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura, ché la diritta via era smarrita. Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte che nel pensier rinova la paura! Tant’è amara che poco è più morte; ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai, dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte.Dante Alighieri, Divina commedia, Inferno, Canto I at Italian Wikisource (in Italian). Spanish poet Bernardo de Balbuena, who lived in Mexico, wrote a long poem in terza rima named Grandeza mexicana Oh tú, heroica beldad, saber profundo, que por milagro puesta a los mortales en todo fuiste la última del mundo; criada en los desiertos arenales, sobre que el mar del sur resaca y quiebra nácar lustroso y perlas orientales; do haciendo a tu valor notoria quiebra, el tiempo fue tragando con su llama tu rico estambre y su preciosa hebra;Bernardo de Balbuena, Grandeza mexicana (in Spanish). In Britain Robert Browning used terza rima in The Statue and the Bust: There’s a palace in Florence, the world knows well, And a statue watches it from the square, And this story of both do the townsmen tell. Ages ago, a lady there, At the furthest window facing the east, Asked, “Who rides by with the royal air?”' The bridesmaids’ prattle around her ceased: She leaned forth, one on either hand; They saw how the blush of the bride increased.See full text at Bartleby.com.
