 "text": "3Dsurvey is a computer program for land surveyors, engineers, and mapping professionals. It helps users make 3D models and maps from pictures taken by drones or ground-based cameras. The program is made by 3Dsurvey d.o.o., a company from Slovenia. == What it does == 3Dsurvey is used to make maps, point clouds, and 3D models of land. It works with pictures or videos from drones, cameras, or mobile devices. It is known for helping reduce complex workflows into a single software solution.3Dsurvey's All-in-One Software Tackles Fragmentation in Modern Surveying – Geo Week News. Retrieved 2025-03-21. == Features == The software includes: * Making 3D models from pictures * Using video to collect 3D data (called videogrammetry) * Creating and editing point clouds * Measuring land and volumes (such as piles or holes)Benefits of Site Monitoring with a UAV and 3Dsurvey Software – GIM International. Retrieved 2025-03-21. * Classifying data into ground, trees, and buildings * Working with tools like GNSS, total stations, or LiDAR == Uses == 3Dsurvey is used in many fields: * Surveying: making topographic maps * Construction: checking site progressTransforming 3D Data Handling with 3Dsurvey – GIM International. Retrieved 2025-03-21. * Mining: measuring stockpiles or land changes * Forestry: studying trees and forest areas * Urban planning: mapping roads and utilities == Licensing == Users can choose different ways to use the software: * A one-time payment (perpetual license) * A yearly or monthly subscription * A 14-day free trial is available There are also extra tools: * RTK Videogrammetry: adds real-time GPS for better accuracy * Scan Module: helps with detailed point cloud modeling == Learning == 3Dsurvey offers learning materials like: * Online tutorials * Case studies * Webinars * Live presentations at trade shows == Academic and third-party studies == 3Dsurvey has been evaluated in academic comparisons with other photogrammetry software tools. A study in 2017 compared it with several others for creating point clouds from drone data.Comparison of UAS-Based Photogrammetry Software for 3D Point Cloud Generation – ResearchGate.
