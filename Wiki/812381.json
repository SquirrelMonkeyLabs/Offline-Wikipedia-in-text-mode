 "text": "A Medicane is a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone. It is a storm in the Mediterranean Sea. These storms are similar to tropical storms and subtropical storms. Weather scientists say there are about one or two medicanes each year. Most of them happen in September and October, when the water in the Mediterranean sea is warm. Sometimes they happen at other times. Scientists say global climate change could make medicanes stronger. ==References== Category:Hurricanes in Europe Category:Mediterranean Sea",
