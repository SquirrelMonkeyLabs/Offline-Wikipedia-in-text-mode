This is now part of Pakistan. Guru Nanak came from a Hindu landowning family, with his father known as Mehta Kalu and his mother as Mata Tripta. When Guru Nanak was a child he refused the upanayana (holy thread) to initiate him into the Hindu religion. Later in his life he married Mata Sulakhani with whom he had two sons. They were called Sri Chand and Lakshmi Das. According to the Sikh religion, one day he was bathing in the river and god took him up to heaven. His family members were very worried as they had thought he died. After three days, he returned with the message of god. He gave up his job to spread the message on how to be a good person. Guru Nanak died in Kartarpur. == References == ==Other websites== * Eternal Glory of Sri Guru Nanak Ji * Sikh-History.com * Max Arthur MacAuliff, The Sikh Religion, Vol 1, (The Life of Guru Nanak Ji), Oxford University Press, 1909. * Satguru Nanak Ji (for Children) - eBook * Sufis, Philosophers, and Nanak * A short video documentary summarizing the life of Satguru Nanak Ji Category:1469 births Category:1539 deaths Category:Punjabi people Category:Sikhism Category:Spiritual teachers Category:Hindu saints Category:Asian Sufis",
