 "text": "== Etymology == The name \"PlushTuber\" refers to a person who has an account on YouTube and creates plush video content. The word \"Plushtuber\" is a combination of \"Plush\" and \"YouTuber\". == Big PlushTubers == Big PlushTubers are people who are exponentially popular because of their plush videos on YouTube. Some Plushtuber have even become famous in the media, for example, SuperMarioLogan. == History == The first plush channel was created by a small channel called ElmoFan, on February 27, 2006, after they decided to share their plush home videos to a public audience. They released their first ever video and also the first plush video ever on March 3, 2006. Sometime after this another plush channel came onto YouTube on December 9, 2006 named TheCuteMarioBros or MarioMario8989 at the time. This plush channel is often mistakenly said to be the first plushtuber ever, though this is false. == Influence == SuperMarioLogan is currently the most-subscribed Plushtuber on YouTube. == Coppa Situation == December 2019, YouTube was caught with having kids on their website illegally which created what was known as the \"COPPApolcalypse\" with many plushTubers moving to Vlare (A YouTube alternative), the COPPAcalypse was expected to happen on January 1, 2020, but eventually nothing happened and many were happy but sadly many deleted their channels or videos. == Trivia == * Many people think TheCuteMarioBros was the first plushtuber, but one of their brothers actually had a plush channel before them called \"ElmoFan\". * ElmoFan was the first to have a non-Mario character as one of their characters. * The most popular plush video is Twenty Five Ways To Kill Yoshi at 240 million views. * The longest running plush channel currently is SuperMario134.
