 "text": "A collectible card game (CCG), or a trading card game (TCG), is a game where the players play by collecting cards that will build their deck to play against other players. It is different from the normal 52-card playing card pack because each player's deck is unique, which means that no two players' decks are the same. The first CCG of this kind was Magic: The Gathering, which first came out in 1993. Other examples include the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game and Yu-Gi-Oh!. Category:Card games",
