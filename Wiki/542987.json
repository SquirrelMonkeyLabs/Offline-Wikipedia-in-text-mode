 "text": "Goofy and Wilbur is an animated cartoon short. It was made by Walt Disney Productions. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures on March 17, 1939. It was the first cartoon with Goofy in a solo role without either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck. In this cartoon Goofy goes fishing with his pet grasshopper, Wilbur. They have nothing but bad luck. The smarter dog, Goofy, and his dumb insect friend catch fish in a fishing net using Wilbur as bait. This cartoon shows a lot of violence, because Wilbur is nearly, or perhaps actually, killed. The cartoon is known for its 13 slapstick adventures during the eight minutes of action. It was released two years after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and a year before Pinocchio and Fantasia (both in 1940). == Plot == Goofy and his friend Wilbur, a tame grasshopper, team up for a fishing expedition. Goofy decides to use Wilber as bait, but he realizes too late that his friend might actually get eaten by a fish. Goofy has a boat he is rowing and a net, but no fishing rod. Wilbur, being a live bug, becomes the perfect choice for bait inside their fishing net, which will attract the fish as food. Wilber's life depends on Goofy to save the little bug, who becomes the bait for a half-dozen fish. As Wilber gets tricked again and again, he is at last swallowed by a frog; then that frog gets eaten by a stork, all while Goofy desperately attempts a chasing rescue. In the end Wilbur hatches out of the stork egg, and to Goofy's relief, seems okay. It is not explained how Wilber ended up in the egg of the stork. One blog writer says: \"I wonder if Goofy has had a psychotic break at the end of the cartoon, and the reappearance of Wilbur is simply a delusion.\" == Releases == *1939 - Original release in movie theaters *1956 - Walt Disney anthology television series, episode #2.22: \"On Vacation\" (TV) *1977 - Donald Duck's Summer Magic (in movie theaters) *1981 - \"Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Cartoon Collections Volume Two\" (on laserdisc) *c. 1983 - Good Morning, Mickey!, episode #59 (TV) *c. 1992 - Mickey's Mouse Tracks, episode #46 (TV) *c. 1992 - Donald's Quack Attack, episode #32 (TV) *c. 1997 - The Ink and Paint Club, episode #1.25: \"Goofy Goofs Around\" (TV) *2002 - \"Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Two: The Complete Goofy\" (on DVD) *2006 - \"Walt Disney's Funny Factory with Goofy\" (DVD) == References == == Other websites == * Category:1939 movies Category:Goofy Category:Disney animated movies Category:Movies about animals",
