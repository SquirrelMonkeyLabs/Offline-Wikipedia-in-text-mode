 "text": "After the fall of the Syrian Arab Republic and the exile of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, a transitional government in Syria was created by the Syrian opposition in Damascus. At first, the government was led by caretaker Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, until Mohammed al- Bashir was named as prime minister on 9 December 2024. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, leader of the Syrian Salvation Government, said that the government would not immediately be taken over by force, and would instead give Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali leadership until the full political transition was completed. Al-Jalali announced in a social media video that he planned to stay in Damascus and work with the Syrian people. He said he hoped that Syria could become \"a normal country\" and begin working with other countries. It was announced on 10 December that the transitional administration will last until 1 March 2025, with all ministers from the Syrian Salvation Government taking up the same posts in the new transitional government. ==Notes== ==References== Category:December 2024 events Category:2024 in Syria",
