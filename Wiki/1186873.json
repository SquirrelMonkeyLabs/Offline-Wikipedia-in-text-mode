 "text": "Uranium hexafluoride is a chemical compound made of uranium and fluorine. It has the chemical formula . Uranium hexafluoride is important in uranium enrichment, which separates isotopes of uranium to make nuclear fuel and nuclear weapons. Uranium hexafluoride is a white solid at room temperature, but turns into a gas at the relatively low . == Uses == Fluorine has only one stable isotope, meaning that any change in molecular mass between molecules of is because of the uranium atom. This allows isotopes to be physically separated based on their mass. Gas centrifuges are used to separate different isotopologues of , producing a stream containing \"enriched\" uranium-235 (and other fissile isotopes) and another containing \"depleted\" uranium-238.
