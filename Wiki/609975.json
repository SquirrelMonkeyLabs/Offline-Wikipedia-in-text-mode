 "text": "The iPhone X is a smartphone developed by Apple Inc. It was revealed on September 12, 2017 at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, at the same time as came out the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The iPhone X was came out in a few countries on November 3, 2017. This iPhone celebrates the 10 years since the iPhone started, with \"X\" standing for the number 10 in Roman numerals. It is the first iPhone to have a notch screen. == Hardware == The iPhone X has an OLED display which measures 5.8 inches diagonally. Apple names this a \"Super Retina Display\". It has a contrast ratio (the difference between the brightest a screen can be, and the darkest) of 1,000,000:1. It is also very sharp, with a resolution of 2436-by-1125. It is also able to change its color temperature using True Tone. According to Greg Joswiak, Apple vice president of product marketing, the screens Apple used in the iPhone X were made to stay away from the \"oversaturation\" of colors that are displayed on most OLED panels by adjusting color so that it dose not look too saturated or very intense. It is have in two colors, Silver and Space Grey. It has a glass casing which Apple claims is \"the most durable ever in a smartphone\", and the entire body is made from stainless steel. Instead of Touch ID, a fingerprint scanner, it uses Face ID, which can recognize a persons face, even in total darkness or in direct sunlight. It cannot be fooled by photos and simple masks, because unlike other solutions, it uses infrared cameras and dot projectors to scan a persons face, which Apple calls the \"TrueDepth camera system\". It can also scan through most eyeglasses and sunglasses, and it can still recognize the user even if they change their hairstyle or grow a beard. People can use Face ID for unlocking their phone or for Apple Pay. The iPhone X has two cameras on the back. The first one is a wide 12MP camera. It can record video at 1080p HD or 4K and slow-mo at 720p or 1080p. The second camera is a zoom camera at also 12MP. Using the second camera, peoples can zoom optically, so the picture does not lose quality. Together, the two cameras can be used for Portrait mode, which blurs the background and keeps the object or person in focus, and Portrait Lighting, which also does the same thing as Portrait Mode, but peoples can actually choose how the lighting looks. There is a 7MP camera In the front. With the TrueDepth cameras, it can make Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. The iPhone X has Animojis, which are moving emojis that copy a peoples facial expressions. There is no home button in the iPhone X. The front and back are made of glass, and it allows for wireless charging with a Qi charger or with Apples own wireless charging pad, AirPower. == Software == Because of the screen, which is very different from iPhones before, apps needed to be updated so that it fills the entire screen. There are changes like a rounded corners, sensor \"notch\" at the top of the screen, and a sign for going to the home screen. Apple published a \"Human Interface Guidelines\" document for explaining and discouraged app makers from attempting to hide the changes. Since there is no home button, it uses swipes and gestures instead, like swiping up to go to the home screen. iPhone X runs iOS 11 for first launch, they can upgrade to other versions like iOS 12, iOS 13, iOS 14, iOS 15 and iOS 16 when they came out. It have features like changes in dock, changes control center, changes in app icon and many others. == Related pages == *iPhone 8 == References == ==Other websites== * X Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2017 Category:Mobile phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording",
