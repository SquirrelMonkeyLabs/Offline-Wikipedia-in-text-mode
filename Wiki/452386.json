 "text": "The Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents.Mike Hamill, Climbing the Seven Summits: A Comprehensive Guide to the Continents' Highest Peaks (Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2012), p. 8 The list is usually Mount Everest (Asia), Aconcagua (South America), Puncak Jaya (Oceania), Mount Elbrus (Europe), Mount Vinson (Antarctica), Kilimanjaro (Africa), and Denali (North America). Sometimes the list is different, but most of the mountains stay the same. It depends on the definition for each continent. For example, some lists use the continent of Australia, not Oceania. The highest mountain in Australia is Mount Kosciuszko not Puncak Jaya (which is in the country of Indonesia). Other lists change the border of Europe, so the highest mountain is Mont Blanc (in France) not Mount Elbrus (in Russia). == References ==",
