They saw it 145 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is about 85.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 85.7 mm long. The iris of the eye is whitish in color with red around the outside. The scientists looked at living frogs. They saw they were light green in color on the back and yellow-green on the belly. This frog has bumps on its skin. There is dark brown color on the back of each bump. Parts of the legs are whitish in color and parts are yellow-green. This frog has extra skin on the sides of all four legs. ==Home== This frog lives on high places where the ground is flat There are many dead leaves on the ground, many tree roots, and small wet places nearby. When scientists caught the first frog to examine, it was sitting in a hole in a tree. ==Name== The scientists named this frog shushupe because that is like the name of a snake in the language spoken by the humans who live nearby. This snake's scientific name is Lachesis muta. Stories say that this snake can sing. Lachesis muta lives in the same places as Tepuihyla shushupe. Scientists think people heard the frog sing and thought it was the snake singing. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
