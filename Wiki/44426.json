 "text": "The Seljuks (also Seldjuk, Seldjuq, Seljuq, sometimes also Seljuk Turks) were a Turkic Sunni Muslim dynasty. They ruled parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries. Their empire was known as Great Seljuk Empire that stretched from Anatolia and the Levant to Afghanistan. The Seljuks also fought the European Christian Crusaders in the First Crusade. The Shia Muslims and other non-Sunnis (such as Zoroastrians) were heavily oppressed under Seljuk rule as the Seljuks were devout Sunnis and saw themselves as the protectors of the Abbasid Caliphate and Sunni Islam. Culturally, the Seljuks were a Persianate empire as they focused heavily on Persianate culture and Persian language. The Seljuk dynasty was founded by Tughril, a Turkmen chief. The Seljuks were one of the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks, the present-day inhabitants of Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan. Originally, the House of Seljuq was a branch of the Kinik Oghuz Turks who in the 9th century lived in the steppes north of the Caspian and Aral Seas in modern-day Turkmenistan. ==Rulers of Seljuk Dynasty 1037-1157== * Toğrül (Toğrül Beg) 1037-1063 * Alp Arslan bin Chaghri 1063-1072 * Jalal ad-Dawlah Malik Shah I 1072-1092 * Nasir ad-Din Mahmud I 1092-1093 * Rukn ad-Din Barkiyaruq 1093-1104 * Mu'izz ad-Din Malik Shah II 1105 * Ghiyath ad-Din Muhammad Tapar 1105-1118 * Mahmud II 1118-1131 * Mu'izz ad-Din Ahmed Sanjar 1131-1157 ==Seljuk Rulers of Kerman 1041-1187== Kerman was a nation in southern Persia.
