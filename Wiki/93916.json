 "text": "The Woolworth Building is a skyscraper in New York City, United States. It is 241 meters (792 feet) tall and has 57 floors. It was built in 1913 and is one of the tallest buildings in the world. A businessman named Frank Winfield Woolworth wanted the building to be built for his business, F. W. Woolworth Company. It was created by an architect named Cass Gilbert. The building was called the Cathedral of Commerce, which means it was like a church of business. The Woolworth Building was the tallest building in the world from 1913 to 1930. Before it was built, the tallest building in the world was the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. The Bank of the Manhattan Company Building (now named The Trump Building) became the tallest twenty-seven years later. == Photo Gallery == Image:Study for Woolworth Building, New York.png|The original drawing of the building before it was built Image:Woolworth Building Apr 2005.jpg Image:Woolworth Tower in clouds New York City 1928.jpg Image:Woolworth Building 1 July 1912 LC-USZ62-100109.jpg Image:Woolworth Building 1913 Manhattan New York City at Night.jpg ==Related pages== * List of tallest buildings in the world * List of tallest buildings in New York City ==References== ==Other websites== * Emporis.com - Woolworth Building *SkycraperPage.com – Woolworth Building *Australianearme.com – Сatalogue Woolworths Category:Skyscrapers in New York City Category:1913 establishments in the United States Category:1910s establishments in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:New York City Designated Landmarks",
