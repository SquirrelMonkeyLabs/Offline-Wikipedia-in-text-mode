 "text": "The Karma Revero is a luxury plug-in hybrid sports Sedan made in the United States. It was first introduced in September 2016 by Karma Automotive, which is owned by the Chinese company, Wanxiang Group. The Revero is based on the Fisker Karma, which was originally made by Fisker Automotive. == History == The original Fisker Karma was produced from 2012 to 2013, but Fisker Automotive went out of business in 2013. In 2014, Wanxiang Group bought the company and its assets, including the rights to the Karma. Production moved to Moreno Valley, California, where the Karma Revero was launched in 2017. The Revero kept many features from the original Fisker Karma but included updates and improvements. In 2020, a new version called the Karma Revero GT was introduced with a different engine and a larger battery. The Revero GT used a 1.5-liter BMW engine as a range extender and had improved electric range compared to the original model. In 2021, Karma introduced the Karma GS-6, a more affordable version of the Revero. It featured a similar battery capacity and all-electric driving range. An all-electric version, the GSe-6, was also announced. This version did not use a gasoline engine and was designed to offer fully electric driving. == References == Category:Electric automobiles Category:2010s automobiles",
