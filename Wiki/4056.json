The source of the water was the same as the source of the Earth's rock: the cloud particles which condensed in the origin of the Solar System.Van Andel, Tjeerd H. 1994. New views on an old planet: a history of global change Chapter 14. 2nd ed, Cambridge. ==Processes== This is the process that water starts and ends in the water cycle. * The cycle starts when water on the surface of the Earth evaporates. Evaporation means the sun heats the water which turns into a gas * Then, water gathers as water vapour in the sky. This makes clouds * Next, the water in the clouds gets cold. This makes it become liquid again. This process is called condensation * Then, the water falls from the sky as rain, snow, sleet or hail. This is called precipitation * The water sinks into the surface and also collects into lakes, oceans, or aquifers. It evaporates again and continues the cycle * This whole process in which water evaporate and falls on the land and later flows back in river and pond is known as water cycle ==Human activities affecting water cycle== * Industry * Agriculture * Deforestation * Dam construction * Removing groundwater from wells * Taking water from rivers ==Related pages== * Rock cycle * Geophysics * Hydrosphere * Carbon cycle * Ecohydrology ==References== cycle Category:Nature Category:Science Category:Physics Category:Weather Category:Earth sciences Category:Environmental science Category:Environmental chemistry",
