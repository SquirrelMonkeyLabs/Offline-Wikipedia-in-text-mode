 "text": "The Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is an insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northwest Pakistan. It involves the United States, United Kingdom, Pakistani military and Pakistani tribes against the Taliban, al-Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The main reason for the conflict was tensions breaking out between Pakistan Armed Forces and al-Qaeda in 2004. 3117 Pakistani armed forces members have been killed, as well as 235+ tribe members and 15 United States soldiers. 17742 insurgents have been killed or captured. During 2004, S.A.S. soldiers were ordered to take out a renegade police officer. Two men were caught by the police and taken back to the station. Tempers had already been running high because of an arrest by soldiers who had turned out to be agents working in the Taliban. In 2023, the National Security Committee of Pakistan, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, decided to launch a new military operation to eliminate militants who pose a threat to the western regions of Pakistan. ==Related pages== *List of ongoing armed conflicts ==References== Category:2000s in Pakistan Category:2010s in Pakistan Category:2020 in Pakistan Category:Al-Qaeda Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Islamic State Category:Taliban Category:Wars involving Pakistan Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:Wars involving the United States Category:2021 in Pakistan Category:2022 in Pakistan Category:2000s conflicts Category:2010s conflicts Category:2020s conflicts",
