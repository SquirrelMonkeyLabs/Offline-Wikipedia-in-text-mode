 "text": "Lewis W. Green was a reverend. Lewis Warner Green born(January 28, 1806 â€“ died May 26, 1863) was an American Presbyterian minister, educator, and academic administrator. In January 1849, Green was chosen president of Hampden-Sydney College. After serving eight years, he was hired by many other organizations. Soon after the Kentucky General Assembly established a regular school, he was persuaded to serve as president of Transylvania, one of these institutions. After a year and a half, the bill that established the regular school was annulled, and he resigned in late 1857. That year, Green was elected president of Centre College, and he took office in January 1858. After guiding the school through the outbreak of the Civil War, he contracted an infection while serving injured soldiers that ultimately led to his death in office in 1863. Bellevue Cemetery in Danville is where he was laid to rest. == References == *sc centre *libguides Category:Religion",
