The original version of the character was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Howard Sherman, and first appeared in More Fun Comics #55 (May 1940). ==Versions== The best known character who became Doctor Fate is Kent Nelson, an archaeologist who is empowered by Nabu of the Lords of Order. The current version of the character, Khalid Nassour, is an Egyptian-American physician (originally medical student) empowered by the Egyptian gods and archangels and has received critical acclaim. Other versions of the character include step- mother/son duo Eric and Linda Strauss, archaeologist Inza Cramer, smuggler Jared Stevens, former psychiatrist Kent V. Nelson, and the reincarnated son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, Hector Hall. == In other media == The character has appeared in various incarnations across multiple forms of media based on both the comics and original characters; the Kent Nelson version notably appeared in the television series Smallville, in which he was portrayed by Brent Stait.
