 "text": "A knock-knock joke is a special kind of conversation that always begins with someone saying, \"Knock-knock!\" and then someone else asking, \"Who's there?\" The basic format is as follows: Joke-Teller: \"Knock-knock!\" Joke-Hearer: \"Who's there?\" Teller: \"[name or word]\" Hearer: \"[name or word] who?\" Teller: \"[answer]\" Knock-knock jokes come from \"do you know?\" jokes in the 1900s and became very popular in the 1930s. ==Example== An example of a knock-knock joke is: Jenny: \"Knock-knock!\" Penny: \"Who's there?\" Jenny: \"Cowsgo!\" Penny: \"Cowsgo who?\" Jenny: \"Cowsgo moo, not who!\" == Popular culture == \"Knock knock\" was the catchphrase of music hall performer Wee Georgie Wood, who was recorded in 1936 saying it in a radio play, but he simply used the words as a reference to his surname and did not use it as part of the well-known joke formula. The format was well known in the UK and US in the 1950s and 1960s before falling out of favor. Knock-knock jokes have been used by Mr. Moose from Captain Kangaroo. ==References== Category:Humor",
