 "text": "Harry Dean Stanton (July 14, 1926 - September 15, 2017)Harry Dean Stanton Biography (1926â€“) was an American actor, musician, and singer. He was known for his roles in Paris, Texas, Kelly's Heroes, Dillinger, Straight Time, Alien, Repo Man, Pretty in Pink, The Last Temptation of Christ, Wild at Heart, The Green Mile, The Pledge, Rango and Lucky. Stanton was a favorite of the late movie critic Roger Ebert who has said that \"no movie featuring either Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad.\" However, Ebert later admitted that Dream a Little Dream (1989), in which Stanton appeared, was a \"clear violation\" of this rule. For his role in Lucky, Stanton was posthumously awarded the Satellite Award in 2018 alongside Gary Oldman. Stanton was born on July 14, 1926 in West Irvine, Kentucky. He studied at the University of Kentucky. Stanton died on the afternoon of September 15, 2017 at a hospital in Los Angeles, California of heart failure at the age of 91. ==References== ==Other websites== * *Entertainment Weekly interview/profile *Actor Harry Dean Stanton dead at 91 (biographic documentary) *www.harrydeanstanton.org Category:Satellite Award winners Category:1926 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Disease-related deaths in Los Angeles Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American stage actors Category:American voice actors Category:American guitarists Category:Musicians from Kentucky Category:Actors from Kentucky Category:Singers from Kentucky",
