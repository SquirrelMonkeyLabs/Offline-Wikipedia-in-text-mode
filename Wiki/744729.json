The 126-room, mansion has the Mar-a-Lago Club, a members-only club with guest rooms, a spa, and other hotel-style amenities. It is located in Palm Beach County on the Palm Beach barrier island, with the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Florida's Intracoastal Waterway to the west. In 1985, Mar-a-Lago was purchased by Donald Trump at a price of around $10 million. His wife at the time, Ivana Trump, was charged with running the property. Trump has been there as President of the United States many times, calling it the Winter White House and his \"Southern White House\". Mar-a-Lago has been used to host meetings for President Trump and international leaders, including Japanese prime minister Shinz≈ç Abe and Chinese president Xi Jinping. It is the second largest mansion in the state of Florida and the 22nd largest mansion in the United States. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Florida Category:Donald Trump",
