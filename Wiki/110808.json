This hymn talks about the Divine grace which reached out to a \"wretch\" (evil person) like himself. After he was saved from his sinful life he worked hard to stop the transportation of slaves on English ships. He worked with the member of parliament, William Wilberforce. The slave trade was outlawed in 1807 in England and other countries soon did the same. 1807 – The Abolition of Slavery The abolition of the slave trade – Chasing Freedom: The Royal Navy and the suppression of the transatlantic slave trade Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth Historic Dockyard history.ac.uk, accessed 30 August 2019 This law was passed just 9 months before Newton's death. == References == == Other websites == *Famous Quotes by John Newton *Amazing Grace: The True Story *Amazing Grace: John Newton information Category:1725 births Category:1807 deaths Category:British abolitionists Category:British Christian hymnwriters Category:English activists Category:English Anglicans Category:English poets Category:English priests Category:Gospel Music Hall of Fame inductees Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Slavers Category:Writers from London Category:British sailors",
