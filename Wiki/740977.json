 "text": "NASA and others have published evidence for the biggest explosion seen in the Universe. It is not the first time such an explosion has been seen. This extremely powerful eruption occurred in the Ophiuchus Supercluster. The supercluster is about 390 million light years from Earth. The explosion was caused by a super massive black hole spraying out jets of extremely active particles. This observation was made by various space-based and Earth-based observatories including the Hubble Space Telescope. == References == Category:Galaxy clusters",
