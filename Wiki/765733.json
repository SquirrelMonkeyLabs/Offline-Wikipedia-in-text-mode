 "text": "Derek Michael Chauvin (born 19 March 1976) is a former American police officer, known for being found guilty of murdering of George Floyd although autopsy reports discover other underlying factors that may have contributed. Chauvin was convicted of three crimes: unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. Unintentional second- degree murder means he was committing another felony crime, in this case, assault. It means he was not necessarily trying to kill Floyd, but he killed him while assaulting him. Chauvin was also convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin was convicted on April 20, 2021 after admitting that he had committed the crimes. He is currently serving a 22.5 year prison sentence, and the other officers who did not step in to intervene are serving sentences. While serving his prison sentences at the FCI Tucson prison, Chauvin was stabbed by another inmate at about 12:30 p.m. local time on November 24, 2023. Prison employees performed \"life-saving\" actions before Chauvin was taken to a hospital. == References == Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American police officers Category:People from Minneapolis Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American people convicted of manslaughter Category:American crime victims",
