 "text": "The Socopo collared frog (Mannophryne lamarcai) is a frog. It lives in the Serranía de Ziruma in Falcón and Zulia in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains. Some of the streams are there all year and some dry up for part of the year. People also see it in grassy places and near forests that are growing back, so scientists think it can live in places that human beings have changed. Scientists saw the frog between 600 and 1460 meters above sea level. The place where the frog lives touches many protected parks: Cuenca Alta de los Ríos Matícora y Cocuiza, Cuenca Alta y Media del Río Machango, Piedemonte Andino-Serranía de Misoa- Trujillo, Burro Negro Dams Protective Zone, Burro Negro National Hydraulic Reserve, and Maticora y Cocuiza Forest Area Under Protection. ==Young== The male frogs sit near rocks and call to the female frogs. Scientists think the female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground near streams. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is in big danger of dying out and scientists in Venezuela says it is in very big danger. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms and towns and places to raise animals. People also take water from streams and use chemicals to make plants grow, and that can hurt the frog too. Climate change can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
