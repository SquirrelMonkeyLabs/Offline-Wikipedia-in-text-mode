 "text": "Karen is a disparaging term for a white woman who is seen as entitled, privileged, or wanting something that is beyond normal. The term is often seen in memes about white women who some say use their white privilege to get something their own way. Stereotypes used by ‘Karens’ are wanting to “speak to the manager“, being racist, or having a bob cut hairstyle. The term has been seen as ageist, sexist, racist, classist, misogynistic and seeking to control women’s behavior. As of 2020, the term appeared largely in media and social media as a criticism of middle class white women, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests. ==References== Category:Internet memes Category:Pejoratives",
