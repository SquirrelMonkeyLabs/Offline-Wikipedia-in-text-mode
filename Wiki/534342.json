 "text": "The War of the Oranges, or the War of the lemon was a brief conflict in Alentjo in 1801. French and Spanish troops invaded Portugal. Portugal was the last British ally in Europe. Napoleon and the Spanish prime minister and Generalissimo Manuel de Godoy demanded that she break her alliance with Britain. When the Portuguese refused they invaded. While laying siege to Elvas Godoy picked oranges from the outside of Elvas and sent them to the Queen of Spain, Maria Luisa, possibly his lover, with the message that he would go on to Lisbon. Thus, the conflict became known as the \"War of the Oranges\".H. V. Livermore: Portugal: A Traveller's History, p. 26 On 6 June 1801 Portugal agreed to the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal agreed to close its ports to English ships, to give commercial concessions to France, to cede Olivenza to Spain and to pay an indemnity. ==References== Category:1801 Category:Napoleonic Wars Category:Wars involving Portugal Category:Wars involving Spain Category:19th century in Spain Category:19th century in Portugal",
