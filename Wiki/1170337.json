On 3 March 1964 the ship with a cargo of phosphorus and benzene caught fire north of Vlieland, the Netherlands. It was towed to a sandbank where it burned down, slippled off and sank a day later. The crew members were rescued, with some having severe burns. Up to 30 years after the fate of the ship, accidents occureed with bathers suffering severe to very severe burns due to phosphorus balls that washed up on the beach. ==Ship details== The ship was built in 1958 by Gdańska Lenina in Gdańsk, Poland and its engine by Crossley in Manchester, United Kingdom. The ship had an steel hull, measured by and had a draught of . She was assessed at 480 BRT. The ship had an 8-cylinder 2 stroke diesel engine, a single shaft and one screw. ==Fate== In March 1964 the ship was on voyage from London to Szczecin with a cargo of phosphorus and 20 tons of benzene in barrels. At 16:15 (local time) on 3 March 1964 at , 12 miles north of Texel, the barrels of benzene exploded and the ship caught fire. It was reported the flames were more than 20 meters high. All 13 crew members got off the ship into lifeboats. Twenty minutes later they were picked up by the Polish MS Monte Casino. Some crew members had severe burns. Hours after the accident, tugs Holland and later also Doggersbank from Terschelling tried to put the fire out but failed.

The glowing phosphorus set his clothes on fire and he suffered third-degree burns to his right thigh, abdomen and right hand. After being treated by a local doctor, he was taken to hospital by ambulance. In the following years, pieces of phosphorus kept washing up, causing burns to bathers.
