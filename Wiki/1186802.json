 "text": "In ring theory, a type of mathematics, an ideal is a subset of a ring that generalizes some properties of sets defined by divisibility, like the even numbers. == Definition == If (R,+,\\cdot) is a ring, then I\\subseteq R is an ideal in R if it is absorptive under the multiplication operator \\cdot. This means that multiplying any element of the ideal by any element of the ring gives an element of the ideal. On non-commutative rings, ideals can be left ideals or right ideals. This depends on the order of multiplication, with left ideals being left absorptive x\\in R,y\\in I\\implies x\\cdot y\\in I and right ideals being right absorptive x\\in R,y\\in I\\implies y\\cdot x\\in I An ideal which is both a left ideal and a right ideal is a two-sided ideal. All ideals of commutative rings are two-sided. == Special cases == Every ring has two trivial two-sided ideals, the zero ideal containing only the additive identity, and the unit ideal, another name for the ring itself. Other ideals are called proper ideals. A ring with no proper two-sided ideals is called a simple ring. A maximal ideal is an ideal that is not a subset of any other ideals except the unit ideal. A minimal ideal is an ideal that has no ideals as subsets except the zero ideal. A prime ideal is an ideal that has the additional property :ab\\in I \\implies a\\in I \\mbox{ or } b\\in I In words, this says that if the product of two elements is in the ideal, then at least one of the elements must be in the ideal. A principal ideal is an ideal containing exactly all the multiples of a single element a: :I = \\left\\\\{ax : x\\in R\\right\\\\} Category:Ring theory",
