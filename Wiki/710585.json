It is the fourth instalment in Pixar's Toy Story series, followed by the spin-off Lightyear in 2022 and Toy Story 5 in 2026. ==Plot== Nine years ago (before Toy Story 3), after rescuing RC from being washed away in a rainstorm, Bo Peep is given away due to Molly not needing her anymore. Woody almost goes with her, but doesn't after realising that Andy still needs him. In the present day, Woody and the other remaining toys are now owned by Bonnie. Woody is no longer the leader of the toys and isn't played with by Bonnie anymore. Bonnie nervously goes to kindergarten orientation while Woody secretly hides away in her backpack. As Bonnie sits alone, Woody throws a spork and some spare objects from a bin onto Bonnie's table; she uses those objects to make Forky. After the orientation finishes, Woody overhears that Bonnie's parents are taking her on a road trip and Forky comes alive in Bonnie's backpack. Upon getting home, Woody introduces Forky to the other toys, but Forky only wants to be trash rather than a toy. During the road trip, Forky jumps out the back window of the family's RV. Woody follows suit. While walking back, Woody explains to Forky why it's his responsibility to be there for Bonnie. Woody accidentally mentions Andy and tells Forky his experience with Andy after Forky asks who he is. The two bond and Forky overcomes his existential crisis. On their way back to the RV, Woody comes across an antique where Bo Peep's lamp is on display. They detour and go inside to look for her, but instead come across a doll named Gabby Gabby. After Gabby offers to take the two to Bo, she explains that her voice box is broken. After hearing Woody's functioning voice box, Gabby says that she wants Woody's voice box. The two escape, but Forky is captured by Gabby's ventriloquist dummy servants while Woody is found by a young girl named Harmony. Now in a playground, Woody reunites with Bo Peep and her sheep whilst escaping from Harmony. Bo introduces Woody to Giggle McDimples and explains that they've been enjoying life as lost toys for seven years. Woody convinces Bo to help him rescue Forky from Gabby. Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear leaves the RV to go and look for Woody. He ends up being trapped in a rigged carnival game where he meets Ducky and Bunny, two plush toys who want to be won and given to a kid. Buzz escapes, with Duck and Bunny chasing after him. Woody and Bo meet up with Buzz and Woody promises to give Ducky and Bunny to Bonnie. The first rescue attempt backfires and Bo's sheep are captured by the ventriloquist dummies. Bo recruits Duke CaBoom, a miniature stunt biker toy who was thrown away by his owner, to help open the locked cabinet that Gabby, Forky, and Bo's sheep are in. After the second rescue attempt, Bo's sheep are rescued but Forky isn't and Woody is the only one who wants to try again. He admits that keeping Forky safe is his only goal left, but accidentally insults Bo; everyone leaves while Woody goes back into the antique store and Buzz returns to the RV. Gabby confronts Woody and explains that she only wants Woody's voice box because she has never been played with because her voice box was always broken and wants to be owned by Harmony. They agree on trading Woody's voice box for Forky. Before leaving in Bonnie's backpack, they watch Harmony find Gabby, only for her to reject Gabby. Forky is found by Bonnie and take back to the RV while Woody comforts a depressed Gabby. He offers to help Gabby be accepted by Bonnie instead, with Bo forgiving Woody afterwards. On their way back to the RV, the toys see a lost child. They agree on a change of plans and give Gabby to the child. When they get to the RV, Woody struggles to say goodbye to Bo. Buzz tells Woody that \"Bonnie will be okay\", allowing him to stay with Bo. Woody says goodbye to all of his friends before the RV leaves. ==Cast== * Tom Hanks as Woody * Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear * Annie Potts as Bo Peep * Tony Hale as Forky * Keegan-Michael Key as Ducky * Jordan Peele as Bunny * Madeleine McGraw as Bonnie * Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby * Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom * Ally Maki as Giggle McDimples * Jay Hernandez as Bonnie's dad * Lori Alan as Bonnie's mom * Joan Cusack as Jessie * Wallace Shawn as Rex * John Ratzenberger as Hamm * Blake Clark as Slinky Dog * Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head * Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head * Jeff Pidgeon as Aliens * Bonnie Hunt as Dolly * Kristen Schaal as Trixie * Timothy Dalton as Mr. Pricklepants * Jeff Garlin as Buttercup * Emily Davis as Billy, Goat, and Gruff * John Morris as Andy ** Jack McGraw as young Andy * Laurie Metcalf as Andy's mother * June Squibb as Margaret * Carl Weathers as Combat Carl * Maliah Bargas-Good as Lost Girl * Juliana Hansen as Miss Wendy * Steve Purcell as Benson and the Dummies * Lila Sage Bromley as Harmony * Mel Brooks as Melephant Brooks * Carol Burnett as Chairol Burnett * Betty White as Bitey White * Carl Reiner as Carl Reineroceros * Alan Oppenheimer as Old Timer * Patricia Arquette as Harmony's Mother * Bill Hader as Axel the Carnie * Flea as the Duke Caboom commercial announcer * Melissa Villase√±or as Karen Beverly * Rickey Henderson as an Oakland Athletics bobblehead figure ==Release== Toy Story 4 premiered on June 11, 2019 in Los Angeles, California and nationwide on June 21, 2019, in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema and IMAX. ==Reception== The movie has made $1 billion worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing movie of 2019.
