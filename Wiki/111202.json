However, Russia insisted that Bulgaria should not be mentioned in the treaty.Krasner, p.165 The Treaty of San Stefano had created a huge Bulgarian state, but the United Kingdom and Austria-Hungary strongly opposed that since Russia would become too powerful. === Independence === The treaty stated that Romania, Serbia and Montenegro were to become independent. The Ottoman province of Bosnia-Herzegovina was to be occupied by Austria- Hungary. The three newly-independent states soon declared themselves to be kingdoms (Romania in 1881, Serbia in 1882 and Montenegro in 1910).
