 "text": "The Gordon Riots were mass rioting in London, England in 1780. The riots started as a non-violent protest. In 1778 Parliament had passed the Catholic Relief Act, which stopped some oppression of people who practised the Roman Catholic Christian religion. For example, it said Catholics could join the army without saying an oath that was against their religion. British people who practised the Protestant religion did not like that. In 1780, Lord Gordon said Parliament should repeal (take back) that law. People who agreed with Gordon put blue cockade decorations in their hats and marched across London Bridge. Then they saw some Lords and called them names and attacked their carriages. Then they found some Roman Catholic churches and set them on fire. ==References== Category:18th century in England Category:1780 Category:History of London Category:Riots in England Category:1780s in Great Britain",
