 "text": "Mixed use is a type of urban development, urban design, urban planning and/or a zoning class that mixes multiple uses. That way there may be shops, restaurants or a cinema at the ground floor of an apartment building, for example.These functions are to some degree physically and functionally mixed, and the building provides pedestrian connections.Business Geography and New Real Estate Market Analysis, Grant Ian Thrall, p.216 Mixed-use development may also be applied to a block or neighborhood, or in zoning policy across an entire city or town. A mixed-use development may be a new construction. Sometimes, it reuses an existing building or brownfield site, or it is a combination.Oâ€™Connell, Evan.
