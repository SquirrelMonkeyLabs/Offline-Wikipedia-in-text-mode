(January 14, 1985 Monday). (retrieved via Lexis) Rylko was hired by the Christian Broadcasting Network after becoming a born again Christian. She was hired to be their reporter in Jerusalem, but was instead made co-host of The 700 Club days after arriving at CBN's headquarters in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She later wrote: \"But no one ever asked me about my politics. I was converted by association from my liberal democratic feminism to conservative Republican fundamentalism. I felt like a wolf in sheep’s clothing adapting somewhat awkwardly to becoming one of the sheep.\" She was the first journalist to report the story of the John Anthony Walker spy ring. She interviewed Walker's daughter, Laura Walker Snyder, for CBN. During the interview, Snyder accused her father of bullying and pressuring his children into becoming spies.\"DAUGHTER SAYS JOHN WALKER PRESSED CHILDREN TO BE SPIES,\" By Susan Rasky, New York Times (June 18, 1985, Tuesday, Late City Final Edition). (retrieved via Lexis) She married Swedish businessman Kai Soderberg in 1983, six months after joining The 700 Club. Soderman was a suicidal alcoholic and the two divorced after she moved back to California. She was fired by Robertson in 1988 after he found out that Soderman had been married and divorced two times before. She stopped being a Christian after her experiences at CBN and went back to San Diego where she hosted Danuta Time, on KSDO radio in the late 1980s and was a news commentator on KUSI-TV in the early 1990s.
