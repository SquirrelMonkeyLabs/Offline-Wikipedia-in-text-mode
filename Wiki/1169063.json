 "text": "Darkwave is a post punk genre, that usually incorporates many gothic synth elements. While it is similar to post-punk and gothic rock, the genre differentiates itself from the two because of how it incorporates synth. In almost every dark wave band, synth plays the chords, and may also even play melody or bass. The genre began in the late seventies and early eighties, and it has seen a resurgence in recent years. Prominent acts include Depeche Mode, early New Order, Clan of Xymox, Lycia, The Frozen Autumn, Pink Turns Blue, Escape with Romeo, Cocteau Twins (Ethereal Subgenre), and early guitar driven Dead can Dance (Ethereal Subgenre).",
