Ansar al-Sharia is a Yemeni jihadist group consisting of several sub jihadist groups from AQAP. In 2011, AQAP created Ansar al-Sharia as a Yemeni subgroup focusing on rebeling against the Yemeni government rather then attacking the West and its allies. International Crisis Group sees the AQAP as a diverse group and many Ansar al-Sharia member groups and allied groups do not align with AQAP's views. == References == Category:Islamist militant groups",
