 "text": "WWE Payback is a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming shows made by WWE. The concept of the event is the wrestlers looking for payback against their opponents. The first event happened on June 16, 2013 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois and took over the slot of No Way Out. Payback then took place yearly until 2017, with that year's event being exclusive to the Raw brand. It then no longer was a yearly show, but the name was used for two events in 2020 and 2023. == Dates and venues == Raw- branded event # Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 Payback (2013) June 16, 2013 Rosemont, Illinois Allstate Arena John Cena (c) vs. Ryback in a Three Stages of Hell match for the WWE Championship 2 Payback (2014) June 1, 2014 The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) vs. Evolution (Batista, Randy Orton, and Triple H) in a No Holds Barred Elimination match 3 Payback (2015) May 17, 2015 Baltimore, Maryland Royal Farms Arena Seth Rollins (c) vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Randy Orton vs. Roman Reigns in a fatal four-way match for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship 4 Payback (2016) May 1, 2016 Rosemont, Illinois Allstate Arena Roman Reigns (c) vs. AJ Styles for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship 5 Payback (2017) April 30, 2017 San Jose, California SAP Center Braun Strowman vs. Roman Reigns 6 Payback (2020) August 30, 2020 Orlando, Florida WWE ThunderDome at Amway Center \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt (c) vs. Braun Strowman vs. Roman Reigns in a No Holds Barred Triple Threat match for the WWE Universal Championship 7 Payback (2023) September 2, 2023 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania PPG Paints Arena Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the World Heavyweight Championship == References == == Other websites == * Category:WWE Payback Category:2013 establishments in the United States",
