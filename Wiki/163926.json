The worm also produces a Denial-of- Service attack on some websites and computers because it sends too much data. ==History== In June 2002, Microsoft released a patch that fixed the weakness that the SQL worm attacked. However, many people did not fix the weakness. In January 2003, the worm was released. Within ten minutes of its release, it had attacked and infected 75,000 internet servers.
