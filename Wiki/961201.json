 "text": "The Combat Infantryman Badge, or CIB, is a United States Army military award. The badge is given to soldiers in the infantry or Special Forces in the rank of colonel or below. A soldier has to fight in active ground combat to receive the award. For soldiers who are not in the infantry or Special Forces, the Combat Action Badge is given instead. For soldiers working in the army's medical field, the Combat Medical Badge is given instead, unless they are a Special Forces Medical Sergeant. A medical sergeant would get the CIB. The CIB was made in November of 1943, during World War II. It was made to keep soldiers confident, and appreciate what they do for the military on the ground. == References == Category:American awards",
