 "text": "Frascati is a historic white wine from the Lazio region in Italy, specifically produced in the Castelli Romani area around the town of Frascati. Known for its light, refreshing taste, Frascati has been popular since Ancient Rome and is one of Italy's most iconic wines. The wine achieved DOC status in 1966 and was elevated to DOCG status in 2011 for select varieties. Frascati is primarily enjoyed as a dry white wine but is also produced in sweet and sparkling versions. == History == The Frascati area has a long tradition of winemaking, with origins tracing back to ancient Rome. Roman writers such as Pliny the Elder and Horace mentioned the wines of the Alban Hills, which were enjoyed by emperors and the elite. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Frascati continued to be celebrated for its wine. Its proximity to Rome made it a convenient and popular choice for the papal court and nobility, who established villas in the area. == Tasting notes == Frascati is known for its light, crisp taste with notes of citrus, green apple, and subtle floral undertones. The wine’s minerality reflects the volcanic soil of the Castelli Romani, and it has a mild acidity that makes it refreshing, especially when served chilled. The DOCG \"Superiore\" version tends to have more body and complexity, suitable for aging. == Serving and pairing == Frascati is best served young and chilled. It is a versatile wine that pairs well with Mediterranean cuisine, especially pasta dishes, seafood, and light appetizers. In the Lazio region, it is traditionally paired with local dishes like porchetta (roast pork) and spaghetti alla carbonara. Frascati’s lightness and acidity also make it suitable as an aperitif. == Cultural significance == Frascati holds a special place in Italian culture and history. The wine is celebrated each year at the Sagra del Vino (Wine Festival) in Frascati, attracting visitors from around the world. It has also been a traditional choice for the Roman nobility and the Catholic clergy. == Related pages == * Castelli Romani * Italian wine * Denominazione di Origine Controllata == References == Category:Italian wines",
