 "text": "The fly orchid, Ophrys insectifera, is a flower which uses scent for mimicry.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - The evolution of imperfect floral mimicry The plant uses scent to mimic the wasps' female sexual pheromones. This attracts male wasps. The wasps pollinate the flowers as they try to mate with them. It is a remarkable example of sexually deceptive pollination and floral mimicry. The plant is pollinated by only two species of wasp of the genus Argogorytes. The soil the orchid grows in is poor, and it needs mycorrhiza to help it get nutrients.BSBI - Vascular Plant Red List == References == Category:Orchids Category:Wasps",
