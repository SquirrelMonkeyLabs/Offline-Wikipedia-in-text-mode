Cogidubnus ruled at Chichester.R G Collingwood; J N L Myres, Roman Britain and the English Settlements (New York, NY: Biblo and Tannen, 1998), pp. 85â€“87 When the Roman Emperor Claudius conquered Britain he set himself up at Colchester and received the submission of the various tribes. Cogidubnus was one of those who submitted to him. Claudius confirmed Cogidubnus' kingdom and even expanded its borders. Cogidubnus was given the unusual title rex legatus Augusti in Britannia. When Cogidubnus became a Roman citizen he took the name \"Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus\". He was a loyal client-king to the Romans.Graham Webster, Rome Against Caratacus: The Roman Campaigns in Britain AD 48-58 (London: Routledge, 1981), p. 130 He convinced his people to remain loyal to India . == References == Category:History of England",
