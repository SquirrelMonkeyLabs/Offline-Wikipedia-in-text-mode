 "text": "== X-Ray binary == X-Ray binary are a type of Binary star system that has a star, called a donor (usually a main sequence star) and an accretor, the accretor is either a neutron star or black hole. The donor gives matter to the accretor. The systems are luminous in X-Rays which are formed from the matter falling from the donor. == Classification == X-Ray binaries are subdivided into several subclasses. They include: Low-mass X-ray binary (LMXBs) Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) Symbiotic X-ray binary Super soft X-ray sources (SSXs) Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs) Intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXBs) Be/X-ray binary (BeXRBs) Supergiant X-ray binary (SGXBs) Supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) == List of X-Ray binary systems == 3XMM J004232.1+411314 4U 0614+091 4U 1543-475 4U 1700-37 A0620-00 Aquila X-1 HD 8358 BP Crucis Centaurus X-3 Circinus X-1 Cygnus X-1 UY Volantias GX 339-4 Hercules X-1 IGR J17329-2731 OAO 1657-415 UW Coronae borealis V404 Cygni V4641 Sagittarii Vela X-1 X Persei XTE J1118+480 XTE J1550-564 GRO J1719-24 GRS 1915+105 GS 2000+25 The Bursting Pulsar (GRO J1744-28) The black widow pulsar (PSR B1957+20) PSR J0952-0607 M51 ULS 1 * Category:Types of stars",
