 "text": "Paterson Clarence \"Pat\" Hughes, DFC (19 September 1917 â€“ 7 September 1940) was an Australian fighter ace of World War II. He served with the Royal Air Force (RAF). During the Battle of Britain he shot down 17 enemy aircraft. This was the highest number of aircraft shot down by an Australian during the battle, and the third highest by an Australian during World War II. Hughes was killed in action on 7 September 1940. Hughes was born in Numeralla, New South Wales. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 1936. After graduating as a pilot, he joined the RAF. In July 1937, he joined No. 64 Squadron, which operated Hawker Demon and, later, Bristol Blenheim fighters. Posted to No. 234 Squadron at the start of World War II, Hughes began flying Supermarine Spitfires. He shared in the squadron's first victory on 8 July 1940, when with two other Spitfires, he shot down a German Junkers Ju 88 attacking ships near Lands End. Hughes was known for attacking his targets at extremely close range. He probably died after his Spitfire was struck by parts from a German Dornier Do 17 bomber that he had just shot down near London. Hughes was able to get out of the plane, but his parachute did not open. After his death he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Hughes was buried in England. == References == == Other websites == * National Archives of Australia: Personal File * Sutton & Wawne Museum: A brief biography of the Australian fighter pilot killed during the Battle of Britain, and buried in Sutton churchyard in 1940 * Battle of Britain Historical Society: Saturday, September 7th 1940 Category:1917 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Australian military people",
