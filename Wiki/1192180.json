 "text": "Zacharias was a Nubian king who ruled in the 7th century. Zacharias, son of Barky, is mentioned in some Arabic sources around the Mosque of Fustat, where he’s referred to as king several times. It isn’t certain in which of the Nubian kingdoms he ruled, but Nobatia is usually assumed. Zacharias is reported to have donated a carved minbar to the Mosque of Fustat. This is said to have happened during the reign of Abd Allāh ibn Saʿd ibn Abī Sarh (645–655). == Literature == * Derek A. Welsby: The Medieval Kingdoms of Nubia.
