 "text": "Quintillus was Roman emperor for seventeen days in September 270. Quintillus was the brother of Claudius Gothicus, who was Roman emperor until September 270. Quintillus took power in the Italian Peninsula when Claudius Gothicus died at Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia). After a short time, Aurelian's army overcame Quintillus's army in a battle at Aquileia in the later part of September. Quintillus then died, either by suicide or by murder by soldiers. Before Quintillus became emperor, he was the procurator (a government official) for Sardinia. Many coins were made during Quintillus's short time as emperor. The Calendar of Philocalus says that he was emperor for seventy-seven days, but most historians agree that he was emperor for only seventeen days. The Historia Augusta says that Quintillus had a wife and two children. == References == Category:210s births Category:270 deaths Category:3rd-century Roman emperors Category:Year of birth unknown",
