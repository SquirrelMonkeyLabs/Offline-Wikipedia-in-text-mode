Due to the shift of networks, the season allows more mature content including blood, swearing and sexual content. Since Mako Iwamatsu died in 2006 after the fourth season ended, Genndy hired Greg Baldwin to voice Aku for the final season. The season takes place fifty years after Jack saw the last time portal destroyed and lost his sword. A High Priestess (voiced by Grey DeLisle) has raised seven women known as the Daughters of Aku to hunt down Samurai Jack. == Reception == The season was well-liked and many liked how darker and edgier the tone was.
