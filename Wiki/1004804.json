This was because the Missionary Office and Department of Divinities were not successful in their national indoctrination objectives.Yoshio Yasumaru, Masato Miyaji, eds. Nihon modern thought compendium 5 Religion and the State, p. 431 The institute was originally intended as a joint organization between Shinto and Buddhism, but eventually became completely dominated by Shinto. On January 1, 1875, there was a fire at the Taikyo Institute caused by arson. This caused confusion and led to four Jōdo Shinshū sects announcing informally that they were leaving the Taikyo Institute.. On May 3, 1875, the Great Teaching Institute was disbanded by the Ministry of Religion and was replaced by the Bureau of Shinto Affairs and later Shinto Taikyo. The \"Great Teaching\" and \"Taikyo Proclamation\" use the same word, as does \"Taikyo\" in \"Shinto Taikyo\". == Related pages == * Bureau of Shinto Affairs * Sect Shinto * Toyama Chukyoin == Sources == == Other websites == * Shinto Taikyo (sect of Shinto) Category:Taikyo Institute Category:State Shinto",
