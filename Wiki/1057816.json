 "text": "The WAGR O class were a total of 56 (46) steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1896 to 1962. The WAGR O class were 2-8-0s built originally by Neilson & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland between 1896 to 1898 with 36 built, and another 10 built by DÃ¼bs & Coy. From 1909 to 1912 the Midland Railway Workshops built 10 Oa class locos in addition to the O class. The O class initially worked on rural branch lines where heavier locos were unable to operate, serving on the Eastern Railway to Fremantle and the South Western Railway to Collie. They later became heavy shunters in their later years. The last O class to be withdrawn was No. 218 in 1962, being used as a steam cleaner at Northam before being donated to ARHS Rail Heritage W.A., it was displayed at Bassendean before being loaned to the Walkaway station museum in 2015 where it is currently displayed.
