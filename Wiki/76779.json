 "text": "General Hospital (commonly abbreviated GH) is the longest-running ABC Daytime American soap opera broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company television network. It is also the longest-running serial produced in Hollywood (having been taped at the Prospect Avenue ABC Television Center West and Sunset-Gower Studios). Set in the fictional city of Port Charles, New York, General Hospital debuted on April 1, 1963, the same day that rival network NBC launched its own medical daytime drama, The Doctors. The show originally aired for a half-hour until the network expanded it to the unusual length of 45 minutes in 1976, and then to a full hour in 1978. The serial was created by soap writers Frank and Doris Hursley, a husband-and-wife team. General Hospital is credited for starting several trends in the soap opera genre in the 1980s, most notably that of the fast-paced action-adventure plotlines that were remarkably different from the more traditional domestic and social issues that had been the sole focus of most soap operas during the previous decades. In 2003, when GH was celebrating its 40th anniversary, TV Guide named it \"The Greatest Soap Opera Of All Time.\" In addition, GH was also named as one of TIME Magazine's \"Top 100 Television Shows of All Time.\" ==Cast== === Current cast members === Actor Character Status Kristen Alderson Kiki Jerome 2013— Bradford Anderson Damian Spinelli 2006— Maurice Benard Sonny Corinthos 1993— Sean Blakemore Shawn Butler 2011— Teresa Castillo Sabrina Santiago 2012— Bryan Craig Morgan Corinthos 2013— Jimmy Deshler Rafe Kovich, Jr. 2013— Chad Duell Michael Corinthos 2010— Michael Easton Dr. Silas Clay 2013— Jane Elliot Tracy Quartermaine 1978–80, 1989–93, 1996, 2003— Genie Francis Laura Spencer Baldwin 1976–84, 1993–2002, 2006, 2008, 2013— Anthony Geary Luke Spencer 1978–84, 1993— Nancy Lee Grahn Alexis Davis 1996— Rebecca Herbst Elizabeth Webber 1997— Roger Howarth TBA 2013— Finola Hughes Anna Devane 1985–91, 1995, 2006–08, 2012— Sean Kanan A.
