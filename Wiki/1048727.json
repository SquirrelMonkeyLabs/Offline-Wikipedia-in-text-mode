 "text": "Roarchestes leucolatus is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it near Elivalmalai Massif in the Western Ghat mountains, between 894 and 958 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in the layer of plants below the trees in forests and on the ground in forests. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes. This frog may have suffered because human beings built dams that filled its habitat with water, but people are not building more dams there, and some of the forests are growing back. Some of the places the frog lives now are protected parks. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Raorchestes, so they think it could infect R. jayarami too. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
