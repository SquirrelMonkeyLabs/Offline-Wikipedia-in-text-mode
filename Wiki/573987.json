 "text": "The WWE Universal Championship was a professional wrestling world championship in WWE for the men of the SmackDown brand. It was one of three world championships in WWE, along with the WWE Championship (with which it was defended together as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship) and the World Heavyweight Championship from the Raw brand. Roman Reigns had held the title for more than one thousand days. The championship was retired following WrestleMania 40. The last champion was Roman Reigns. == History == === Creation === With the return of the WWE Brand Extension in the middle of 2016, a draft took place in July 19. The WWE Champion Dean Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown. And as a result, Raw was left without a world title. On the July 25, 2016 episode of Raw, Stephanie McMahon and the general manager Mick Foley created the WWE Universal Championship to be the world title of the program. The first champion was determined at SummerSlam on August 21, 2016. Finn Bálor beat Seth Rollins to win the title. === Undisputed WWE Universal Championship === At WrestleMania 38 Night 2 on April 3, 2022, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match to win both championships and become the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. WWE called the match a championship unification match; however, both titles's histories are still seperately active with Reigns being a double champion, defending both titles together across both brands as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. On the April 24, 2023, episode of Raw, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H announced that regardless of what brand Reigns was drafted to in the 2023 WWE Draft, he and his undisputed championship would become exclusive to that brand. Triple H then presented a new World Heavyweight Championship for the other brand, which was won by Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins at Night of Champions. Reigns was drafted to SmackDown and the World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to Raw. On the June 2, 2023, episode of SmackDown, Triple H gave Reigns with a new singular championship belt to represent the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Despite this, Reigns' manager Paul Heyman continued to carry the old WWE and Universal Championship belts until the end of July. After Cody Rhodes won the championships from Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match at WrestleMania XL Night 2 on April 7, 2024, the championship was retired. == Title history == === Reigns === Reign The reign number for the specific champion listed Location The city in which the title was won Event The event promoted by the respective promotion in which the title was won \\+ Indicates the current reign is changing daily Wrestler Reign Date Days held Location Event Notes 1 Finn Bálor 1 < New York, NY SummerSlam Beat Seth Rollins in a pinfall and submission-only match to become the first champion.
