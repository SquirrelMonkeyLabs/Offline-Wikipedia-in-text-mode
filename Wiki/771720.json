 "text": "Elmer J. McCurdy (January 1, 1880 â€“ October 7, 1911) was an American bank and train robber. He was killed in a shoot-out with police after robbing a train in Oklahoma in October 1911. ==Life== He was known as \"The Bandit Who Wouldn't Give Up\". His mummified body was first put on display at an Oklahoma funeral home and then became an attraction on a carnival and sideshow circuit during the 1920s through the 1960s. ==Remains== After changing ownership several times, McCurdy's remains are currently up at The Pike amusement zone in Long Beach, California. On December 8, 1976, the production crew of the television show The Six Million Dollar Man were filming scenes for the \"Carnival of Spies\" episode at The Pike. During the shoot, a prop man moved what was thought to be a wax mannequin that was hanging from the set. When the mannequin's arm broke off, a human bone and muscle tissue were seen. The body was identified to be the mummified corpse of McCurdy a few weeks later. ==Burial== In April 1977, Elmer McCurdy's body was buried at the Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma. ==References== Category:1880 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in the United States Category:American criminals Category:People from Maine Category:People from Oklahoma",
