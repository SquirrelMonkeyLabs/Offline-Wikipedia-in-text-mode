 "text": "Diana Trujillo has had many roles at NASA, including flight director, mission lead, and deputy team chief of engineering. She is part of the small group that leads the Mission Control Center during all of NASA’s human spaceflight missions. Trujillo played key roles in missions to Mars such as Curiosity, Perseverance, and Ingenuity. When she was young, looking at the night sky in her backyard inspired her love of space. She was told that it would be impossible for her to have a career in space, but Trujillo became the first Hispanic woman to be admitted to the NASA Academy. Trujillo co-created and hosted #JuntosPerserveramos, NASA’s first Spanish live broadcast of a planetary landing. She has promoted the inclusion of Latinas at the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics and on Sesame Street. In 2021, she was honored with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation’s STEM Awards in 2020. Trujillo’s life story was turned into a children’s picture book, celebrating her achievements and encouraging kids to get into STEM and space, and to follow their dreams. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2025",
