According to LamboXtra, Youthly \"went on to maintain chart dominance in his region for almost two weeks.\" In November 2023, Okon released his second album, Emergent.

Emergent performed well internationally, reaching #1 on the South African iTunes Alternative chart and #2 on the overall South African iTunes chart.

The title track of Just Dom continued his chart success, reaching #1 on the South African iTunes Alternative Singles chart and #9 on the all-genres chart.
