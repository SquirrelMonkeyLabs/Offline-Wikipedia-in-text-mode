 "text": "Saul Hudson (born July 23, 1965), who is most known professionally as Slash, is an English American musician. Originally from Stoke-on-Trent, his family moved to Los Angeles, California when he was a child. He is perhaps most known for being lead guitarist of hard rock band Guns N' Roses from 1985 to 1996. After leaving the band due to tensions with Axl Rose, Slash first formed Slash's Snakepit and then later co-founded Velvet Revolver with his former Guns N' Roses bandmates Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum. He also makes guest appearances starting from Alice Cooper's 1988 documentary film The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years and Iggy Pop's 1990 album Brick by Brick. In August 2009, Time Magazine named him #2 on its list of the 10 Best Electric Guitar Players of All-Time. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:English guitarists Category:American rock guitarists Category:American heavy metal musicians Category:Guns N' Roses members Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:People from Staffordshire Category:English singer-songwriters Category:English record producers Category:American record producers",
