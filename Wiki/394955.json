 "text": "The memorial for the Defenders of the Old City of Jerusalem is a memorial dedicated to the Israeli soldiers who fought for the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The memorial is located at the entrance to the Garden of the Missing Soldiers in the National Military and Police Cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The soldiers the memorial is dedicated to were buried temporarily in the Jewish Quarter until the war was finished, and then they were reburied in other places. The place that was their grave in the Jewish Quarter is marked today with a monument. The memorial was designed in the shape of an alley by the architect Dr. Asher Hirem. The arch is inscribed with 2 verses from the Bible: Jeremiah 31:8: \"(God speaks to the people of Israel) I shall gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth.\" and Isaiah 66:14:\"Your bones shall flourish like the grass.\" == Other websites == * the story of the temporary grave in the old city of jerusalem in the jewish quarter website * the memorial photo in Fotki Category:Monuments and memorials in Mount Herzl Category:Military monuments and memorials in Israel",
