 "text": "The Royal Colleges of Surgeons are old colleges (a form of corporation) that make rules for surgeons. The first Royal College of Surgeons started in England. Other Royal Colleges of Surgeons are organisations in many present and former members of the Commonwealth of Nations. These organisations are now also responsible for training surgeons and setting their examinations. Membership of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (MRCS) is a postgraduate diploma for surgeons in the present-day UK and Ireland. This qualification allows a candidate to become a member of one of the four surgical colleges in the UK and Ireland, namely the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The MRCS qualification is a multi-part examination including theory and practical assessments. Part A is a 4-hour written examination which was used to assesses the applied basic sciences and principles of surgery in general. Part B is a 5-hour practical examination which assesses elements of day-to-day surgical practice through a series of stations on anatomy, pathology, critical care, clinical procedures and patient evaluation (history taking, clinical examination and communication skills). Candidates must complete both exams before they can apply for higher surgical training. == References == Category:Surgery Category:Qualifications Category:18th-century establishments in Great Britain",
