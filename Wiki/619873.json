Ruth has a prisoner, Daisy Domergue, who will die when he turns her in. Along the way, they agree to let former Confederate Chris Mannix travel with them, but they do not believe his story that he is the new sheriff. During a blizzard, they stop at an inn. There, they find several more people, including Confederate General Sandy Smithers, cowboy Joe Gage, and executioner Oswaldo Mobray. Bob, a worker, says the inn's owner is traveling. Warren and Ruth do not trust anyone and take all their guns. Warren, who fought for the Union Army, kills Smithers after saying that he also killed Smithers' son.
