This caused some new records in how hot the weather got in the British Isles. The Met Office said that there might be a lot of heat in some places, and made a extreme heat warning for some places in the United Kingdom. Just before this, all nations in the British Isles said it was the hottest day of the year. == References == Category:2021 disasters in Europe Category:2021 in the United Kingdom British Isles heat wave",
