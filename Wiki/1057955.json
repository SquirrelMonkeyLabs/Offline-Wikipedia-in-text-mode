Untriunium and Utu are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol, which are used until the element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, it is expected to follow Untrinilium as the tenth element of the Superactinides and the twelfth element of the 8th Period. Similarly to Untrinilium, it is expected to fall within the range of the island of stability. ==Related pages== *Untrinilium *Untribium Category:Hypothetical chemical elements",
