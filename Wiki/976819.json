 "text": "\"La Concorde\" (\"The Concord\") is the national anthem of Gabon. ==Lyrics== French lyrics English translation United in the concord and the brotherhood, Awaken thee, Gabon, dawn is at hand. Stir up the spirit that thrills and inspires us! ùÑÜ At last we rise up to attain happiness. ùÑá I Dazzling and proud, the sublime day dawns, Dispelling for ever injustice and shame. May it rise, rise again and calm our fears, May it promote virtue and banish warfare. II Yes, may the happy days dreamed by our ancestors Come for us at last, rejoice our hearts, And banish the sorcerers, those perfidious deceivers Who sow poison and spread fear. III So that, in the eyes of the world and of friendly nations, The immortal Gabon may maintain her good repute, Let us forget our quarrels, let us build together The new structure of which we are all dreaming of. IV From the shores of the Ocean to the heart of the forest, Let us remain vigilant, without weakness and without hatred! Around this flag which leads us to honour, Let us salute the Fatherland and ever sing! ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Gabonese culture",
