 "text": "A binary solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more than two substances whose composition can change within a certain limits. The boiling point of binary solution depends upon the solution composition and there can be three cases: # the boiling points of solutions of all compositions lie between the boiling points of clean liquids # the boiling points of solutions of any composition lie above the boiling points of clean liquids # the boiling points of solutions of some compositions lie below the boiling points of clean liquids Category:Chemistry",
