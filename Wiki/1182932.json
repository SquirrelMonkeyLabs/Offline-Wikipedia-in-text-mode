 "text": "Learned helplessness is the behavior shown by a subject after having repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control. ==Overview== Learned helplessness was initially seen as being caused by the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness, by way of their discontinuing attempts to escape the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon showing such behavior, the subject was said to have reached a state of learned helplessness. Neuroscience has provided insight into learned helplessness, showing that the original theory was wrong. The brain's default state assumes that the control is not present. The presence of control is thus learned. However, it is unlearned when a subject is faced with prolonged aversive stimulation. ==Humans== In humans, learned helplessness is related to the concept of self-efficacy â€’ the individual's belief in their ability to achieve goals. The learned helplessness theory is the view that clinical depression and related mental illnesses may be caused by a real or perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation. ==Neurobiology== Neurobiological research has shown that increased 5-HT (serotonin) activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus plays a huge role in learned helplessness. Other parts of the brain responsible for helpless behavior include the basolateral amygdala, central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Activity in medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, septum and hypothalamus has also been observed during states of helplessness. ==Psychology== ===Developmental psychology=== In developmental psychology, the order of various stages of neurobiological development is important. It is said that there are two different types of \"helplessness\" appearing at different stages of the development. In early development, a baby is naturally helpless and must learn \"helpfulness\" toward mature neurophysiology. The \"helplessness\" that appears after maturation is what is properly called \"learned helplessness\", despite some researchers equating this infantile form of \"helplessness\" with the pathological and adult form. ==References== Category:Psychology",
