 "text": "The \"Himno di Kòrsou\" is the anthem of Curaçao. == Lyrics == Generally, only the first and last verses are sung. Papiamento original IPA transcription English translation (unofficial) Dutch translation (unofficial) I Let's raise our voice and sing the grandeur of Curaçao; Curaçao, small island, a boulder in the sea! Curaçao, we love you above all nations. Your glory we sing with all our hearts. II Our people have their struggle but we always have our faith to accomplish always victory through labour! Let us do our part for the island's prosperity. Let us unite forces so we can triumph. III (To) Our fatherland we demonstrate honour and loyalty, as to the flag the union of our nation. Our lives would be little to give for our country, fighting united for liberty, love and understanding. IV And when we are far from home we all recall Curaçao, its sun and beaches the pride of us all. Let us praise our Creator always and forever, for He has made us worthy to be born of Curaçao! ==References== Category:Curaçao Category:Dutch anthems Category:National anthems",
