It changed its name from Xrefer in 2007. Subscriptions are available to academic, government, public and company libraries. Access to Credo Reference is free to users if their library is a subscriber. Librarians can select which titles they wish to subscribe to within Credo General Reference. They can manage the selection during their subscription period by swapping titles in and out. Between 2000 and 2003, Xrefer offered a free sitewayback supported by advertising, and was one of Wikipedia's main competitors as a free content encyclopedia. When the dot com bust caused Internet advertising revenues to collapse, Xrefer launched a premium subscription variant, called Xreferplus. On 17 June 2003, the free service stopped. ==References== ==More information== * Golderman, Gail; Connolly, Bruce. \"eReviews: General Reference Sources and Short Takes\", Library Journal.com, Oct 15, 2010. ==Other websites== * corp.credoreference.com Category:Online dictionaries Category:Encyclopedia websites",
