 "text": "The Serbian Progressive Party (, SNS) is a big tent (centrist) party in Serbia, and the country's ruling party since 2012. Its current president is Miloš Vučićević, however it's most famous member and de jure ruler is the current president of Serbia, Aleksandar Vučić. It split from the Serbian Radical Party in 2008, and it was a member of the opposition against the ruling Democratic Party until 2012, when they won the 2012 presidential election due to their anti-corruption campaign. Vučić became the prime minister in 2014, and formed a coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia. He then won the 2017 presidential election, while Ana Brnabić succeeded him as prime minister. Vučić was reelected in 2022. == Ideology (Beliefs) == The Serbian Progressive Party is often described as populist, since they often say they're the party of the people, their ideology is also largely influenced by what is currently popular with the voters, which is why they are also described as a \"big tent\" party. Economically, they are pro- capitalist, and socially, they have both left (some support for the LGBTQ+ movement) and right (ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church) wing aspects. === Media and freedom === SNS is often criticized for reducing the Freedom of the Press, as well as civil liberties (various freedoms that citizens have) and for centralizing the government, which can especially be seen in the province of Vojvodina. == References == Category:Political parties in Serbia",
