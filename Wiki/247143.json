 "text": "Otto Rehhagel (; born 9 August 1938) is a German former football coach and player. Rehhagel is one of two people to have played in more than 1,000 Bundesliga matches as a player and coach (the other being Jupp Heynckes). In the Bundesliga, he holds the records for most wins (387), most draws (205) and most losses (228), with his team scoring more goals (1,473) and conceding goals (1,142) than any other team. From 1981 to 1995 he worked as manager for Werder Bremen, winning the Bundesliga twice with them and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1992. After a rather unfortunate intermezzo at Bayern Munich, he sensationally won the Bundesliga with promoted team 1. FC Kaiserslautern. ==Playing career== Born in Altenessen, Rehhagel began his career with local club TuS Helene Altenessen in 1948, then transferred to Rot-Weiss Essen (1960–63) and then played the Bundesliga at Hertha BSC (1963–65) until 1972 for Kaiserslautern. He played 201 games in the Bundesliga. ==Career statistics== Team From To Record G W D L Win % 1\\.
