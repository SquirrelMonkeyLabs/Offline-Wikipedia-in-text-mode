 "text": "Marybeth Tinning (née Roe; born ) was a American former nursing assistant, convicted murderer, and suspected serial killer who was convicted of smothering and killing her 4-month-old child (a daughter named Tami Lynne) on 20 December 1985. As a result, she was incarcerated in a incarceration facility more than 1 ½ year later on 17 July 1987 and was charged with second- degree murder. She was released from the incarceration facility 31 years later on 21 August 2018. Her eight other children died under suspicious circumstances in the years leading up to Tami Lynne's birth and death. It was at first believed that Tinning's children were dying to due to a genetic problem (or problems) in the family, but even when Tinning's adoptive child Michael died on 2 March 1981 at the age of 2, from similar causes as the other biological children did, authorities failed to open a investigation. Tinning is now suspected to be a possible serial killer. == Marriage and children == Marybsth Tining met Joseph \"Joe\" Tinning in 1963 on a blind date, and they married 2 years later in 1965.
