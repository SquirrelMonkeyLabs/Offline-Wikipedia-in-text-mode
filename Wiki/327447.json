 "text": "Marcus Jamal Hopson (born July 18, 1985 in Los Angeles, California), known professionally as Hopsin, is an American rapper, hip hop producer, actor and music video director. Hopsin was signed to Ruthless Records in 2007. He left later due to lack of support and financial compensation. Hopsin was angry at the owner Tomica Wright and claimed that she didn't know what she was doing. He stated that his first studio album Gazing at the Moonlight was released without his consent and that he wasn't even able to listen to the mastered version before it was released. He left the label when Tomica said \"He doesn't do his job as an artist\". In 2009, Hopsin founded an independent label called Funk Volume with business partner Dame Ritter. He also acted as a minor character in an episode of That's So Raven, made a guest appearance in the movie Fame and starred in the independent movie Bomb the World. == Discography == === Studio albums === Hopsin has released 6 studio albums: Year Album 2009 Gazing at the Moonlight 2010 RAW 2012 Haywire 2013 Knock Madness 2015 Pound Sydnrome 2017 No Shame ==Filmography== ===Films=== Title Year Role Other notes Max Keeble's Big Move 2001 Pizza Parlor Guy Extra Fame 2009 Senior Rapper Supporting role Bomb the World 2010 Face Starring role Independent Living: The Funk Volume Documentary 2013 Himself Starring role ===Television=== Title Year Role Other notes That's So Raven 2003 Guy #2 Extra 1 episode (\"To See or Not to See\") Murder In The First 2015 Fatty B Paradise City 2021â€“present Gabriel ==References== ==Other websites== * Funk Volume * Hopsin's Official Facebook page * Hopsin's Official Twitter * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Rappers from California Category:Singers from Los Angeles",
