 "text": "Bappa Rawal also known as Kaal Bhoj, was the ruler of the Mewar kingdom of Rajasthan, India. He is credited for repelling the Arab invasions in India. ==Literary accounts== The Ekalinga Mahatmya, the Ekalinga Purana, written in the 15th century CE, describes how Guhila dynasty's founder Guhadatta, ninth in descent, founded the Mewar kingdom in 728 CE and built the Eklingji Temple. The process states that Bappa witnessed his father Nagaditya and all male members of the family slaughtered by the Bhils from the region of Idar. After facing such a dreadful battle, he took shelter-aided by two faithful Bhil attendants-was raised working as a cowherd for a Brahmin woman in Nagda. Later on, Bappa met the sage Harit Rashi, who initiated him into the Shaivite order. After going through intense tapasyas, Bappa would avenge his father's death. The sage later on also urged him to construct the Eklingji Temple in Nagda, which would ultimately become the family deity of the Mewar rulers. Other similar legends of sage and king have appeared in other traditions, like the legend of the sage Gorakhnath and Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah, or even a tale in Al-Biruni's writings about the alchemist Vyadi and King Vikramaditya. == Military Career == Bappa Rawal is believed to have captured Chittor Fort from the Arabs, who had defeated the local rulers, the Moris, around 725 CE. After the Arab invaders were pushed back by a confederacy that included Bappa, he gained fame and control of Chittor. Some scholars, like R. C. Majumdar, suggest Bappa's heroics in this battle helped elevate his status, leading to his mistaken identity as the founder of the dynasty. Other historians, such as R. V. Somani, believe Bappa was part of an anti-Arab alliance formed by the Pratihara ruler Nagabhata I. Shyam Manohar Mishra theorized that Bappa was once a vassal of the Mori ruler Manuraja and became more famous by leading the campaign against the Arabs. He later either replaced or succeeded Manuraja. Following his success against the Arabs, Bappa Rawal participated in conflicts with the Rashtrakutas, Pratiharas, and Cholas. He is said to have helped the Pratiharas against the Rashtrakutas, which helped him gain control of parts of the Mewar region. == Coinage == Gold coins with the legend \"Shri Voppa\" or \"Shri Vopparaja\" are linked to Bappa Rawal, but this connection is debated. Some believe the coins belong to King Vappuka of the Surasena dynasty, mentioned in a 955 CE inscription from Bayana. One coin with the legend \"Shri Voppa\" shows Shaivite symbols like a trident, a linga, and a bull. Below them is an image of a man lying down with large, pierced ears. This could represent Bappa's initiation into a Shaivite sect, possibly the Pashupata sect, as ear piercing was linked to it. The name \"Rawal\" was also used by a Pashupata clan in the 8th century. Another coin shows a haloed Rama holding a bow, with a bull and elephant beside him. The other side shows a king on a throne with attendants and the legend \"Shri Voppa.\" A different coin with the \"Shri Vopparaja\" legend features a bull, trident, linga, and an attendant. The other side shows a cow with a calf. ==References== Category:Kings and queens Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing",
