 "text": "The granular leaf frog (Hylomantis granulosa) is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have seen it up in as high as 700 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests. It can live in forests that grow back after they are cut down. It can live by the edges of forests. The female frog lays eggs in cracks in rocks or on low branches. The tadpoles swim in streams or ponds that dry up for part of the year. Scientists do not think this frog is in danger of dying out, but human beings do cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, places for animals to eat grass, and towns. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
