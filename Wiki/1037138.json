 "text": "A group of wildfires broke out in the U.S. state of Hawaii in early August 2023. They were mostly on the island of Maui, with small fires on Hawai ªi. They caused a lot of people to be evacuated and caused a lot of damage. The wildfires killed at least 90 people in Lahaina. An emergency proclamation was signed on August 8. It allowed multiple actions. These included activation of the National Guard, appropriate actions by the director of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency and the Administrator of Emergency Management, and using state money to deal with conditions created by the fires. On August 9, the state government of Hawaii issued a state of emergency for the whole state. On August 10, President Joe Biden issued a federal major disaster declaration. ==References== Category:2020s fires in the United States Category:August 2023 events Category:2023 in the United States Category:21st century in Hawaii Category:2023 fires Category:Wildfires",
