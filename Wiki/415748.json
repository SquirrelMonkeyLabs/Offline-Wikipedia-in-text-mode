 "text": "A Sit-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. It is made from fiberglass. Early sit-skis looked like kayaks and had metal edges. Sit-skis are used for para-Nordic skiing and para-alpine skiing. If the sit-ski has one ski, it is sometimes name a mono-ski. If a sit-ski has two skis, it is sometimes called a bi-ski. Skiers first used bi-skis in para-alpine skiing before using mono-skis. Mono- skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill. Sit-ski users use outrigger skis. In para-Nordic skiing, a sit-skier may use a normal ski pole that is not as long as one people standing up to ski would use. When skiers first learn to ski, their teacher may be connected to them on a tether until the skier can control the sit-ski on their own. == References == Category:Skiing equipment",
