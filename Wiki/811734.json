 "text": "The Bardufoss concentration camp was in Northern Norway in the municipality of MÃ¥lselv. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the Nazi authorities made a \"concentration camp in the town of Bardufoss,\" as an annex to the Grini concentration camp. It opened in March 1944 because other camps were too crowded, particularly Grini and the Falstad concentration camp. The area was cold. The camp had a very bad reputation for hard work, little food, and not enough shelter. It is estimated that 800 prisoners passed through the camp. About 550 were still there when the camp was liberated. == Related pages == * Glossary of Nazi Germany * The Holocaust * List of books about Nazi Germany * List of concentration and internment camps * List of Nazi-German concentration camps * Nazi concentration camps * Nazi Party * Nazi songs * World War II == References == Category:1944 establishments in Europe Category:1940s establishments in Norway Category:Nazi concentration camps in Norway",
