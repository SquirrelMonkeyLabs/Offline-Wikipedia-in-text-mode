 "text": "Italian brainrot is an Internet meme from early 2025. They show surrealist pictures of AI-generated creatures with names that are inspired by the Italian language. ==Name== The phrase brain rot was used as early as 1854. ==Description== Italian brainrot combines unusual creatures and AI to create outlandish, and sometimes vulgar reactions. Videos often have fictitious creatures with \"Italian\" names, while the video is narrated by an AI voice, with a nonsensical description of the creature or animal. The meme is purposely illogical, with objects or items mixed with animals. ==History== Tralalero Tralalero is a three-legged shark with blue Nike shoes. First created in January 2025 by deleted Tiktok user @Ezburger401, Tralalero Tralala was the first creature in Italian brainrot to become widespread. The meme has roots with other European memes featuring animals, like German Brainrot, a similar internet meme where animals are depicted in obscure scenarios. The meme was formed in Italy, but has been enthusiastically shared and reproduced by Americans, Russians, and Indonesians. == Characters == This list contains the relevant characters of the Italian Brainrot: Tralalero Tralala is an athletic shark with blue Nike shoes. Bombardiro Crocodilo is a crocodile fused with a military bomber plane. A minor character is Brrr Brrr Patapim of. whom is a Proboscis monkey, with large human feet. Tung Tung Tung Sahur is an anthropomorphic wooden character resembling an Indian club; that is holding a baseball bat. The Tung Tung Tung in the character's name is an onomatopoeia reference to the drum-beating used in Indonesia to signify the beginning of Suhur. Ballerina Cappuccina is a ballerina with a cappuccino mug as a head who wears a tutu and pointe shoes. The character emphasizes the absurdity of the genre by combining the incompatible: an everyday object and a classical dance image. The original meme featured her pirouetting gracefully. ===Controversy=== Tralalero Tralala and Bombardino Crocodilo have been called Islamophobic, as lyrics from Tralalero Tralala's origin video mock Allah in Italian, though some Italian users have brushed it off as generic blasphemy. The character Bombardino Crocodilo has been criticized for making fun of Gaza genocide, with some videos using audio which jokes about the plane bombing children in Gaza and Palestine. ==Notes== ==Sources== Category:2025 Category:Internet memes",
