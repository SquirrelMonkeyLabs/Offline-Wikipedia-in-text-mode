The most popular song they have brought out is \"Bodies\" which is often called \"Let The Bodies Hit The Floor\" because of the repeated line in the chorus. They have brought out five albums on the record label Eleven Seven, and have one live album out called Loudest Common Denominator. ==History== === Early years as instrumental trio (1996–1998) === Drowning Pool formed in Dallas, Texas in 1996.

When asked if the band had any unreleased songs, according to a 2002 Blabbermouth article, drummer Mike Luce replied that \"only 3-4 songs were done, including one called \"Heroes,\" which is a tribute to dead rock musicians such as Layne Staley.
