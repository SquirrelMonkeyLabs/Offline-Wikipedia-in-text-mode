 "text": "Series 80 (formerly Crystal) is a mobile software platform introduced in 2000 that uses Symbian. It was made by Nokia for their enterprise and professional level smartphones. All devices that use it have a screen resolution of 640×200 pixels and a full QWERTY keyboard. The large size of the screens are used to good effect, but software has to be developed specifically for it and the market for it was relatively small. The last Series 80 device is the Nokia 9300i, announced in 2005 and shipped in 2006. The last Communicator, the Nokia E90 Communicator, released in 2007, uses S60 3rd Edition instead of Series 80. ==Features== * Support for editing popular office documents * Full QWERTY keyboard * Integrated mouse for navigation * SSL/TLS support * Full web browser based on Opera * VPN support ==Devices== S80 v1.0: * June 2001 — Nokia 9210 Communicator * June 2001 — Nokia 9290 Communicator (American variant of Nokia 9210 Communicator) * May 2002 — Nokia 9210i Communicator (improved version of Nokia 9210 Communicator) S80 v2.0: * February 2005 — Nokia 9500 Communicator * July 2005 — Nokia 9300 (not branded as \"Communicator\") * March 2006 — Nokia 9300i (improved version of Nokia 9300; not branded as \"Communicator\") ==Games== * Doom port for S80 * SCUMM emulator for S80 (allows you to play games like Monkey Island, etc.) ==References== Category:Mobile phones",
