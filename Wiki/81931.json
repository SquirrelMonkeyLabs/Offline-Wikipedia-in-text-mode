 "text": "The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ECRML) is a European treaty that was adopted in 1992. It was designed by the Council of Europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in Europe. It applies only to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties that are very different from the majority or official language. The treaty does not protect languages that are used by recent immigrants from other countries. Also, the treaty does not protect local dialects of the official or majority language. To be protected, a language must be spoken either by the people living in a region or area of the country or by a minority in the country as a whole (languages such as Yiddish and Romani are covered by the treaty even if there is no \"Romani region\"). National official languages are not covered by the treaty, but some regional official languages are. For example, Catalan is official only in a region of Spain and so can benefit from the treaty. However, Irish cannot because it is an official language in Ireland even if it is a minority language. However, Irish is protected in Northern Ireland because it is not an official or national language of the United Kingdom. France has signed the treaty, but the French constitution does not allow the government to support a language other than French. There are two levels of protection. Every country that signed the treaty must give all qualifying languages the lower level of protection. Countries may decide to give some languages the higher level of protection. Countries then must do 35 things. == Languages protected under the Charter == Here are the countries that have ratified the Charter and the languages for which the ratification was made: ratification: 25 January 2002 * Assyrian * Greek * Russian * Kurdish as Yazidis' language ratification: 28 June 2001Austria has ratified the Charter for each language in respect of specific Länder * Croatian of Burgenland * Slovene (in Carinthia and Styria) * Hungarian (in Burgenland and Vienna) * Czech (in Vienna) * Slovak (in Vienna) * Romani (in Burgenland) ratification: 21 September 2010 * Albanian * Montenegrin * Czech * Italian * Hungarian * Macedonian * German * Polish * Romanian * Rusyn * Slovak * Slovene * Turkish * Ukrainian * Jewish languages (Yiddish and Ladino) ratification: 5 November 1997 * Czech * Hungarian * Italian * Rusyn * Serbian * Slovak * Ukrainian ratification: 26 August 2002 * Armenian * Cypriot Maronite Arabic ratification: 15 November 2006 * Slovak (parts II and III, across the whole territory) * Polish (part II; and part III in Moravia-Silesia, in districts Frydek-Místek and Karviná) * German (part II only) * Romani (part II only) ratification: 8 September 2000Notes Verbales accompanying the Danish ratification specified that, whilst the Charter was not going to be ratified in respect of the two languages, Faroese and Greenlandic are each official in their respective territories * German (in Southern Jutland) ratification: 9 November 1994 *Karelian *Sami *Swedish (co- official language) ratification: 16 September 1998Germany has ratified the Charter for each language in respect of specific Länder * Danish (in Schleswig-Holstein) * Upper Sorbian (in the Free State of Saxony) * Lower Sorbian (in Brandenburg) * North Frisian (in Schleswig-Holstein) * Saterland Frisian (in Lower Saxony) * Romani (across Germany) * Low German (part III in Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein); (part II in Brandenburg, Northrhine-Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt) * Low Rhenish (in Northrhine-Westphalia) ratification: 26 April 1995 * Armenian * Boyash * Bulgarian * Croatian * German * Greek * Polish * Romani * Romanian * Rusyn * Serbian * Slovak * Slovene * Ukrainian ratification: 18 November 1997 * No regional or minority languages ratification: 22 June 2005 * No regional or minority languages ratification: 15 February 2006 * Albanian * Romani ratification: 2 May 1996 * West Frisian (in Friesland) * Limburgish (in Limburg) * Low Saxon (across the Netherlands) * Romani (across the Netherlands) * Yiddish (across the Netherlands) ratification: 10 November 1993 * Sami (parts II and III) * Kven (part II only) * Romani (part II only) * Scandoromani (part II only) ratification: 12 February 2009 * Belarusian * Czech * Hebrew * Yiddish * Karaim * Kashub * Lithuanian * Lemko * German * Armenian * Romani * Russian * Slovak * Tatar * Ukrainian ratification 24 October 2007 Part II applied to: * Albanian * Armenian * Greek * Italian * Macedonian * Polish * Romani * Rusyn * Tatar * Yiddish Part III applied to: * Bulgarian * Croatian * Czech * German * Hungarian * Russian * Serbian * Slovak * Turkish * Ukrainian ratification: 15 February 2006Ratified as Serbia and Montenegro on December 22, 2005 Web page of Council of Europe, Reservations and Declarations for Treaty No.148 - European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages * Albanian * Bosnian * Bulgarian * Croatian * Hungarian * Romani * Romanian * Rusyn * Slovak * Ukrainian ratification: 5 September 2001 * Bulgarian * Croatian * Czech * German * Hungarian * Polish * Romani * Rusyn * Ukrainian ratification: 4 October 2000 *Hungarian *Italian *Romani ratification: 9 April 2001 *Aragonese, luenga propia in Aragon *Astur-Leonese, present in Asturias; and in part of Leon, Zamora, Cantabria and Extremadura (recognized in Asturias, Castile and León and Miranda do Douro) *Basque (official in the Basque Country and part of Navarre) *Catalan, official in the Balearic Islands and Catalonia; llengua propia in Aragon. *Valencian (A dialect of Catalan, official in Valencia) *Galician, present in Galicia; and in part of Asturias, Leon and Zamora provinces (official in Galicia) ratification: 9 February 2000 * Finnish * Meänkieli * Sami * Romani * Yiddish ratification: 23 December 1997 *Italian *Romansh ratification: 19 September 2005 Ukraine does not specify languages by name, but rather ratifies on behalf of \"the languages of the following ethnic minorities of Ukraine\": July 2007, Ukraine's entry on the Council of Europe site states the following Ukraine declares that the provisions of the Charter shall apply to the languages of the following ethnic minorities of Ukraine : Belarusian, Bulgarian, Gagauz, Greek, Jewish, Crimean Tatar, Moldavian, German, Polish, Russian, Romanian, Slovak and Hungarian.
