His mother died when he was four years old, and his father died when he was seven. As a result, he grew up an orphan but he had a stable upbringing. He was an Islamic Scholar from Saudi Arabia. And also was a teacher and a author in Unaizah, Saudi Arabia. He authored more than 40 books in several different fields including tafsir, fiqh, and 'aqidah. He had already attracted attention at a young age with his intelligence and his strong enthusiasm for learning. After the death of his father, he had read the Qurʾān, then thoroughly memorised it by the time he was eleven years old. Then he began learning from the learned men of his town and those who visited it. He worked hard until he acquired a respectable amount of knowledge in every field. When he reached the age of twenty-three, he began teaching. Like that, he used to both learn and teach, and the entirety of his time was spent doing that. It was like that until in the year 1351H, he was placed in charge of education in his town, and became a mentor for all the students. == Other websites == * * Biodata at MuslimScholars.info Category:1889 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Imams Category:Salafis",
