Retrieved on 4 November 2008. ==Definition== A One Day International is an international cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has one innings. ==History== Namibia are associate members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Retrieved on 4 November 2008. Namibia played their first ODI matches during the 2003 Cricket World Cup after qualifying by reaching the final of the 2001 ICC Trophy. At the World Cup, Namibia played in six One Day internationals (the ICC granted ODI status to all matches played at this competition). Namibia were defeated in each of their six matches; their best result came in a 55 run loss to England. These were the only ODI matches played by Namibia until they gained ODI status after reaching the final of the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two. ==Key== General * – Captain * – Wicket-keeper * First – Year of debut * Last – Year of latest game * Mat – Number of matches played Batting * Runs – Runs scored in career * HS – Highest score * Avg – Runs scored per dismissal * * – Batsman remained not out * 50 – Half-centuries scored * 100 – Centuries scored Bowling * Balls – Balls bowled in career * Wkt – Wickets taken in career * BBI – Best bowling in an innings * Ave – Average runs per wicket * 5WI – Five wickets or more in a match Fielding * Ca – Catches taken * St – Stumpings taken ==Players== :Statistics are correct as of 14 March 2022.
