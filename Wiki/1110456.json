Ramlee, who also starred in it, along with Sharifah Hanim, Mariani Ismail, and Mahmud Jun. ==Plot== The story is set in Kuala Lumpur in 1965. Sha'ari is a teacher by day and a musician by night. Norkiah, a young woman, rents the room next to his. They both work at a nightclub, with Norkiah's friend Mariani, a dancer. Sha'ari and Norkiah often argue and annoy each other. In one incident, Norkiah throws a portrait at the wrong person, causing a fight among the tenants. The next day, Sha'ari is teaching Bahasa Melayu and a student mistakenly changes a sentence, making fun of Sha'ari's lack of sleep. The students leave to play without his permission, prompting the headmaster, Mohd Basar Muhammad, to inspect Sha'ari. He finds Sha'ari sleeping and reprimands him for partying at night, which is against school rules and Islamic teachings. Sha'ari promises not to perform at nightclubs on weekdays. One day, Sha'ari helps Norkiah retrieve her stolen purse on a bus. They fall in love, unaware they are the neighbors who quarrel. Norkiah lies about being a cooking school teacher while she continues singing at the nightclub. Norkiah's mother and brother visit, and she has to take them shopping, missing a meeting with Sha'ari. Back home, Norkiah hangs her clothes over to Sha'ari's room, and he pushes the pole down. She drenches him with water in retaliation. When Sha'ari climbs up to confront her, he discovers she is the woman he loves. They marry, but Sha'ari wants her to quit her job, which she can't due to a contract. One night, Sha'ari is invited to perform at his old club and learns that his wife sings there under the name Norkiah Hanum. Angry at her lie, he builds a wall between their rooms. Norkiah tries to apologize, but he insults her. Norkiah's friends trick Sha'ari into thinking she is having an affair. He breaks into her room and finds her alone with a tape recorder. Realizing his mistake, he apologizes and they reconcile. The story ends with Sha'ari becoming a headmaster and having five pairs of twins with Norkiah. ==Cast== * P.
