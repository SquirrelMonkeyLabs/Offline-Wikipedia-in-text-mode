He represented the state's 17th Congressional district from 1983 to 2003, when he was unseated in a major upset. Undaunted by his unexpected defeat, Gekas was elected to the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1976 and was reelected in 1980. Pennsylvania lost two districts after the 2000 census. One of the districts that was eliminated was the Reading-based 6th District, represented by five-term moderate-to-conservative Democrat Tim Holden.
