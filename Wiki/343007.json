 "text": "The name Brenda [ bren-duh ] is a female given name in the English language. Its origin is uncertain, but it may be derived from a Scandinavian type of language, rather than Celtic like the masculine name Brendan. The moniker Brenda has its roots in Old Norse and signifies \"sword\". It was initially utilized during the 19th century and gained popularity in the 20th century. The appellation was popularized by the eponymous 1950s tune \"Brenda Lee\" by vocalist Brenda Lee. Throughout history, the name has taken on various forms, such as Brenna, Brenn, and Brendon. This is a unique name (not in the top 1000 newborn names in the US in 2021). The name has been around for many centuries. Many famous people are named Brenda, including Brenda Blethyn, Brenda Song and Brenda Lee. ==People== * Brenda Archer, Guyanese high jumper * Brenda Benet, actress * Brenda Blethyn, English actress * Brenda Bruce, English actress * Brenda Castillo, Dominican Republic volleyball player * Brenda Eisler, Canadian long jumper * Brenda Gibbs, Australian actress * Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond, first female Lord of Appeal in Ordinary * Brenda Joyce, actress * Brenda Matthews, New Zealand sprinter * Brenda Robertson, Canadian politician * Brenda Strong, American actress * Brenda Lee, American singer and recording artist ==Places== * Brenda, Manitoba ==References== Category:Given names",
