 "text": "A series of protests against the economic policies of Ecuadorian president Guillermo Lasso, caused by increasing fuel and food prices, began on 13 June 2022. The protests are being led by Indigenous activists such as members of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE). The protests have been joined by students and workers. Lasso declared a state of emergency and later extended it on 22 June. The protests have caused food and fuel shortages as protestors have blocked exits and entries to the country's capital of Quito. The protest ended on 30 June 2022 after a government deal was made. ==References== Category:June 2022 events Category:2022 protests Category:2022 in South America Category:2020s in Ecuador",
