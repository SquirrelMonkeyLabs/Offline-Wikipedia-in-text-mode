 "text": "This is a list of people who have served as vice president of the United States. As of 2025, there have been 50 vice presidents. JD Vance has served as the 50th and current vice president since 2025. If a president dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the vice president becomes president. Eight vice presidents have become president through the president's death (John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson); Gerald Ford is the only vice president to become president through the president's resignation. Spiro Agnew is the only vice president to resign. Two vice presidents, Gerald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller, were appointed by the president. Three vice presidents have temporarily served as acting president when the president was unavailable: George H. W. Bush on July 13, 1985; Dick Cheney on June 29, 2002 and on July 21, 2007; and Kamala Harris on November 19, 2021. The youngest person to become vice president was John C. Breckinridge at 36 years old; the oldest was Alben W. Barkley at 71 years old. Two vice presidents, George Clinton and John C. Calhoun, served under more than one president. Six vice presidents (John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and Joe Biden) were later elected president. Kamala Harris was the first female vice president and the first vice president of color. ==List of vice presidents== Vice presidency Vice presidency Vice President Vice President Party Party Election President 1 April 21, 1789 – March 4, 1797 John Adams Pro-Administration 1788–89 George Washington 1 April 21, 1789 – March 4, 1797 John Adams Federalist 1792 George Washington 2 March 4, 1797 – March 4, 1801 Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican 1796 John Adams 3 March 4, 1801 – March 4, 1805 Aaron Burr Democratic-Republican 1800 Thomas Jefferson 4 March 4, 1805 – April 20, 1812 George Clinton Democratic-Republican 1804 Thomas Jefferson 4 March 4, 1805 – April 20, 1812 George Clinton Democratic-Republican 1808 James Madison colspan=6 1808 James Madison 5 March 4, 1813 – November 23, 1814 Elbridge Gerry Democratic-Republican 1812 James Madison colspan=6 1812 James Madison 6 March 4, 1817 – March 4, 1825 Daniel D.
