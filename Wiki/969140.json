 "text": "General elections were held in Sweden on 11 September 2022 to elect the 349 members of the Riksdag who in turn would elect the Prime Minister of Sweden. The early results shown on 15 September 2022 showed the government parties lost their majority, which were confirmed by the final results published on 17 September 2022. This caused Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson to announce her resignation. On 17 October 2022, Moderate Party (M) leader Ulf Kristersson was elected prime minister with 176 to 173 votes in the Riksdag. ==References== Category:September 2022 events Category:2022 elections in Europe Category:2020s in Sweden Category:Politics of Sweden",
