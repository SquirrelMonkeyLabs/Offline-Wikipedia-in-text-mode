 "text": "The Game Boy Camera is an accessory for the Game Boy line of video game consoles. It was released in Japan, North America, and Europe in 1998. It allows a person to take 128x112 black and white digital pictures. It is meant to be used with the Game Boy Printer, which uses a special kind of paper to print saved pictures. It can be used with most Game Boy consoles, but the Game Boy Micro will not work, and the Game Boy Advance SP will take images upside- down. It was the only Nintendo product to allow a person to take pictures until the release of the Nintendo DSi console. The cartridge for the Game Boy Color had minigames that were based on early games from Nintendo's history . These games were Space Fever II, a sequel to the 1979 Nintendo arcade game Space Fever. Ball, a game where the player catches and throws balls by moving their hand. DJ, a music game where players can create their own chiptune music, and Run! Run! Run!, a game where the player races a mole and a bird. ==References== Category:1998 video games Category:Game Boy games Category:Nintendo hardware Category:Nintendo video games Category:Photography video games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Video games developed in Japan",
