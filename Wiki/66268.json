He was one of the early creators of rock and roll music in the 1950s. ==Career== In 1951 Little Richard began his music career by making gospel and jazz influenced rhythm and blues. He did not sell many records until 1955 when he added a loud drum beat and loud Gospel-style singing and boogie-woogie piano playing. This new music would come to be known as of rock and roll. Little Richard influenced many rock and roll musicians who started after him. In 1957, when he was at his most popular point, Little Richard quit rock and roll music. He went to Bible college and became a church preacher. He then went on to play only Gospel music for many years. He returned to playing rock and roll when he was older, and also continued playing Gospel music. In 1986, Little Richard was added into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was one of the first seven people to be added to the museum. ==Death== Little Richard died of bone cancer on May 9, 2020 at his brother's home in Tullahoma, Tennessee at the age of 87. He is survived by his brother, sister and his adopted son Danny. ==Singles== Release date Title Chart Positions US Charts US R&B; chart UK Singles Chart 11/55 \"Tutti Frutti\" #17 #2 #29 4/56 \"Long Tall Sally\" #6 #1 #3 4/56 \"Slippin' and Slidin'\" #33 #2 - 6/56 \"Rip It Up\" #17 #1 #30 6/56 \"Ready Teddy\" #44 #8 - 10/56 \"Heebie-Jeebies\" - #7 - 10/56 \"She's Got It\" - #9 #15 12/56 \"The Girl Can't Help It\" #49 #7 #9 12/56 \"All Around the World\" - #13 - 3/57 \"Lucille\" #21 #1 #10 3/57 \"Send Me Some Lovin'\" #54 #3 - 6/57 \"Jenny Jenny\" #10 #2 #11 6/57 \"Miss Ann\" #56 #6 - 9/57 \"Keep A Knockin'\" #8 #2 #21 2/58 \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\" #10 #4 #8 6/58 \"Ooh!
