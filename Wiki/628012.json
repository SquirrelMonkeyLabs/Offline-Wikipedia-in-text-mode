 "text": "The fimbria are projections of tissue that come out from the ends of the Fallopian tubes. They appear to be in the shape of fingers. The largest of these fimbria, the fimbria ovarica, is attached to the ovary. The fimbria form a funnel shape that helps move the egg cell (ovum) into the Fallopian tube and then the uterus. == References == Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system",
