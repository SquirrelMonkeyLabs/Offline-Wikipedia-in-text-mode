 "text": "The Portland Pirates were an American professional ice hockey team that played from 1993 to 2016. Throughout this time, they played in the American Hockey League (AHL) and were the farm team of the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL. They played their home games in Portland, Maine at the Cumberland County Civic Center, and won one Calder Cup which was in 1993. The team left Portland after the 2015â€“16 season when it was bought by a group from Springfield, Massachusetts. That city had lost its AHL team, the Springfield Falcons, when the team was bought by the owners of the NHL's Arizona Coyotes and moved to Tucson, Arizona, where it now plays as the Tucson Roadrunners. The former Pirates team now plays as the Springfield Thunderbirds. ==Other websites== *Portland Pirates' Official Site Category:1993 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Maine Category:2016 disestablishments in the United States Category:American Hockey League teams Category:Chicago Blackhawks minor league affiliates Category:Ice hockey teams in the United States Category:Portland, Maine",
