 "text": "Lucy is a NASA space probe on a 12-year journey to eight different asteroids. It will visit a main belt asteroid as well as seven Jupiter trojans. They will be fly-by encounters. The Lucy spacecraft is the part of a US$981 million mission. Lucy is a special space mission. It's going to explore some small rocks called Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These rocks are leftovers from when our solar system was forming. They're stuck in orbits near Jupiter, but not too close. There are lots of these asteroids, and they come in two groups that move ahead of and behind Jupiter as it goes around the Sun. Scientists think there are as many Trojans as there are asteroids in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. == Path of Lucy == Lucy's job will last for 12 years. It will visit more asteroids than any other mission before. First, it will check out two asteroids that circle the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, and also a new satellite. Then, it will visit eight Trojans, including five asteroids and the satellites of three of them. Lucy will also swing by Earth three times to use its gravity to help it move, which no other spacecraft has done from as far away as the outer solar system. == Flyby Date == Dinkinesh Nov. 1, 2023 unnamed satellite Nov. 1, 2023 DonaldJohanson April 20, 2025 Eurybates and its satellite Queta Aug. 12, 2027 Polymele and its unnamed satellite Sept. 15, 2027 Leucus April 18, 2028 Orus Nov. 11, 2028 Patroclus and its satellite Menoetius March 3, 2033 ==References== Category:NASA spacecraft",
