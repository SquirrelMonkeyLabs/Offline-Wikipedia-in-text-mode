 "text": "Agave is a type of succulent plant from Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States. They have thick, sharp leaves. Agave plants flower only once, produce seeds and then die. Before flowering they usually live for 10 to 25 years. Because they live for a long time they are sometimes called \"century plants\". Agave is used to make things like tequila, agave syrup and pulque. They were an important food for many indigenous people in the southwestern United States, such as the Navajo and the Hokoham. ==Images== Image:Agave_americana4.jpg|Agave americana var. americana File:Agave americana74.jpg|Agave americana 'Marginata' Image:Agave americana 'Medio- Picta' Plant 3264px.jpg|Agave americana cv.
