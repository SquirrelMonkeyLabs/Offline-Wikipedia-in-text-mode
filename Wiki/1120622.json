 "text": "Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi bin Ali, born on 11 February 1950, is a Malaysian lawyer and politician who was Attorney General of Malaysia from 2015 to 2018. Six months after starting his job, he said Prime Minister Najib Razak did nothing wrong in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and SRC International cases and ended the investigations. == Controversy == ===1MDB scandal=== On 26 January 2016, at a press conference, Apandi cleared Prime Minister Najib Razak of any wrongdoing regarding funds transferred from Malaysian government company SRC to his personal bank accounts. Apandi said the money came as a personal donation from the royal family of Saudi Arabia, was returned, and he decided to stop investigating. However, it was later found that there were differences in Apandi's explanation. It turned out that the money came from SRC, not as donations from Saudi Arabia as initially said. The Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission intended to check Apandi's decision. After facing criticism and accusations from then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in May 2018, Apandi was put on leave and later fired as Attorney General in June 2018. His dismissal happened while investigations continued into the misuse of funds related to 1MDB. ==References== Category:Malaysian lawyers Category:Malaysian politicians Category:1950 births Category:Attorneys general",
