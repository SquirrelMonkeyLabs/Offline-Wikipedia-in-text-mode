 "text": "Ameerega ignipedis is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== The adult frog is 20.3 to 24.2 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown near the backbone and patterned black nearer to the sides of the body until it is all black on the sides. There are yellow stripes from the nose over the eyes down the sides of the body. There are also smaller yellow stripes from the mouth to where the front legs meet the body. The legs have brown, black, blue, and yellow color in different places. The iris of the eye is black in color. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in Serranía de Contamana but they think it lives in other places too. It lives in forests near streams. Scientists found some frogs next to a stream that was hot because of heat from underground. The frog is more common in streams where the water is 90° C or hotter, but it can live in colder streams. Scientists saw the frog between 220 and 331 meters above sea level. The frog lives near one protected park, Sierra del Divisor National Park. This place has been a park since 2015. ==Young== People have seen male frogs carrying tadpoles on their backs. In other species in Ameerega, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water after the eggs hatch. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. But it is in some danger people dig mines and drill in the ground for oil in the Sierra del Divisor where the frog lives. People also cut down trees to get wood and build farms. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
