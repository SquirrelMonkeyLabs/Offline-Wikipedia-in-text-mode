 "text": "Cyclonic separation is a process to take out all of the unwanted particles from air, gas, or steam. The process uses a process called vortex separation and does not use filtering. It uses rotational and gravitational force to separate the unwanted particles. The process is done in a device called cyclone separator or \"cyclone\". The word \"cyclone\" in meteorology (weather) is a force in which the air's movement spirals inward. ==Usage== * Cement industry * Fossil fuel power stations * Oil refinery * Sawmill Category:Engineering",
