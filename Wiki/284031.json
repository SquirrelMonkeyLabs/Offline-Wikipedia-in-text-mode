It is in Guilford County. ==History== Greensboro was started in 1808. It was built in the middle of Guilford County. It grew slowly, but was rich because of cotton. In the 1840s, a railroad was built going through Greensboro, making it grow faster. The Civil War did not hurt Greensboro much. In the early 1900s, Greensboro grew a lot because of textiles. They also became rich. A lot of stuff happened during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s in Greensboro, including a sit-in at a counter in a restaurant. Now, Greensboro continues to grow, and is located at the intersection of two big freeways, Interstate 40 and I-85. ==References== Category:County seats in North Carolina",
