 "text": "The Puer tree frog (Zhangixalus puerensis) is a frog. It lives in China and Vietnam. People have seen this frog in meadows that have a lot of water in them and forests with trees in the families Juncus and Cyperaceae. The female frog makes a foam nest on grass near bodies of water that do not move. The tadpoles swim in the water. People have seen this frog between 1400 and 2500 meters above sea level. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Rhacophorus dugritei. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. The frog's home has protected parks in it: Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve, Wuliangshan Nature Reserve, and Ailaoshan Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
