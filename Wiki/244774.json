He ran for President as a Democrat three times, in 1896, 1900, and 1908, but lost each time. During this time, he was the main leader of the Democratic Party. He was one of the first people who gave lots of speeches around the country while running for President, and continued to give speeches even when not running on what was called the \"Chatauqua Circuit\". He was United States Secretary of State from 1913 to 1915. In his last years, he was one of the lawyers in the Scopes Monkey Trial.
