 "text": "A steam turbine is a machine that gets thermal energy from pressurised steam. It uses the energy to do mechanical work by rotation. It is usually connected to a generator to produce electricity. The heat to produce steam comes from burning a fuel such as coal, from burning trash in an incinerator, from the waste heat of other industrial processes, from a nuclear reactor, or from a natural source such as sunlight or geothermal heat. ==Sizes== There are many sizes of steam turbines, from small ones (less than 0.75 kW) for pumps and other devices, to larger ones (1,500,000 kW) for producing electricity. ==Related pages== * Turbine * Steam engine Category:Machines",
