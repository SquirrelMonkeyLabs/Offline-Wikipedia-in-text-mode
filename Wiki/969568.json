The monument is located vicinity in the front of José Rizal Coliseum and the Calamba City Hall. Both landmarks where located in \"The Plaza of Calamba\". == Symbolism == Detail of José Rizal's statue on the monument. There is also an official explanation of the meaning of the monument's details. The monument depicts Rizal in an overcoat holding a book, that has the title of his book \"NOLI ME TÁNGERE\" inscribed. This is contrary to the usual representation of the book as a symbol of both the inscribed novel and its sequel El Filibusterismo, as well as Rizal's annotation of Antonio de Morga's Sucesoss de las Islas Filipinas. The obelisk is usually taken to mean Rizal's masonic background while the three stars are said to stand for Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. The figures at the back of the monument, such as leaves and a pot, are said to symbolize the country's natural resources. The consensus is that the figures beside Rizal—a mother rearing her child and two young boys reading—signify family and education. ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials Category:Laguna (province)",
