 "text": "In combat sports like fencing, boxing, karate, etc., the cover is a defensive movement permitting to protect oneself against strikes by placing a weapon or a body part like the fist, forearm, elbow, arm or shoulder before the aim aimed by this attack. This form of defence, so-called \"passive\", is different from the block or parry that are considered \"active\". The cover has nearly the same meaning as \"protection\" especially in boxing when a fighter raises his arm in order to protect his face or head against a possible attack. One puts cover to use: * in expecting way in case of the opponent's attack, especially in order to protect his or her own forward movement (example: raising the shoulder before the jaw, covering oneself with the arm and the glove) * in instantaneous (i.e. happening at once) way when the opponent's attack is launched. == In boxing and boxe pieds-poings == The cover in boxing is a form of defence commonly used in the hand-to-hand situations and when the fighter suffers by a large number of strikes.
