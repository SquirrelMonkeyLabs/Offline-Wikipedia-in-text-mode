It lives on farms and in forests with evergreen trees. People see it on the ground and in small woody plants. Scientists do not know if this frog is hurt when people change the forest or if it likes places that human beings have changed. People have seen this frog between 0 and 300 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Rakhine Yoma Elephant Sanctuary. ==Young== The male frog sits on a plant 1 to 2 m above the ground and calls to the female frogs. The female frog makes foam and lays her eggs in it. She lays them on leaves over water. Scientists have seen female frogs laying eggs on Arum plants. No scientist has written about seeing the tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. People have seen it in places that human beings have changed. Scientists do not know if it is harmed by these \"disturbed habitats\" or if it survives better in them than in places human beings have not changed. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
