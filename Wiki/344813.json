 "text": "The Treaty of Paris was signed on May 20, 1303, between England and France. In the Treaty of Paris (1259), Gascony was given to England, as a fief. On all occasions when there was a change of monarch in France or England, the vassal England had to give praise to its lord, France. Edward I of England did this, in the years 1272 and 1285, and also reminded France that it had the same duties. 1294, the treaty was broken. Philip IV of France occupied Guyenne, in Gascony. The English king made it an Allodial title, and was prepared to go to war over it. Philip was only able to keep Guyenne until 1303. With the Treaty of Paris, Edward obtained Guyenne, as well as the cities of Bordeaux and Bayonne. Edward II of England gave allegiance to the French King, and married his daughter, Isabella.
