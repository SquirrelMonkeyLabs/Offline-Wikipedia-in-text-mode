The airline borrowed airplanes from many different companies.At different times, it flew Boeing 727, Boeing 737, Boeing 757 and Airbus A320 airplanes. The airline was among one of the first low-cost carriers. In December 1995, Air New Zealand started Freedom Air. It was another discount airline intended to compete with Kiwi. In September 1996, Kiwi Travel stopped flying due to the intense competition from Freedom Air.
