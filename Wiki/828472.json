 "text": "The 2020–21 UEFA Europa League knockout phase began on 18 February with the round of 32 and will end on 26 May 2021. == Qualified teams == The knockout phase involves 32 teams: the 24 teams which qualified as winners and runners- up of each of the 12 groups in the group stage, and the eight third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage. === Europa League group stage winners and runners-up === Group Winners (seeded in round of 32 draw) Runners- up (unseeded in round of 32 draw) A Roma Young Boys B Arsenal Molde C Bayer Leverkusen Slavia Prague D Rangers Benfica E PSV Eindhoven Granada F Napoli Real Sociedad G Leicester City Braga H Milan Lille I Villarreal Maccabi Tel Aviv J Tottenham Hotspur Antwerp K Dinamo Zagreb Wolfsberger AC L 1899 Hoffenheim Red Star Belgrade === Champions League group stage third-placed teams === == Format == Each tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which is played as a single match, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: * In the draw for the round of 32, the twelve group winners and the four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage with the better group records were seeded, and the twelve group runners-up and the other four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other. * In the draws for the round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter- final winners is not known at the time of the semi-final draw. A draw is also held to determine which semi-final winner is designated as the \"home\" team for the final (for administrative purposes as it is played at a neutral venue). In the knockout phase, teams from the same or nearby cities (e.g., Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur) are not scheduled to play at home on the same day, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, adjustments have to be made by UEFA. For the round of 32, since both teams were drawn to play at home for the second leg, the home match of the team which were not domestic cup champions in the qualifying season, or the team with the lower domestic ranking (if neither team were the domestic cup champions, e.g. Tottenham Hotspur for this season), were moved from Thursday to a different day. For the round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which were not domestic cup champions in the qualifying season, or the team with the lower domestic ranking, will be reversed from the original draw. == Schedule == The schedule is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).
