 "text": "VRS or Video Relay Service is a service by which deaf people can use sign language on phone calls. In some countries it has largely replaced the use of TTY for this purpose. VRS uses a video camera and a high-speed Internet connection, to let people call friends, family, and business associates. A deaf or hard of hearing person can use a remote control and call an interpreter. When interpreter comes on their screen, the caller can call any hearing person and have a phone conversation through the interpreter. VRS was invented in the 1990s in Sweden. In the early 21st century it became available in the United States. A person in the United States, can make calls to, or receive calls from, anybody in the world via VRS. ==Other websites== * Pinky tells the Real Story Video Relay Service VRS * Proud Geek presents: List of Video Relay Services Category:Electronics",
