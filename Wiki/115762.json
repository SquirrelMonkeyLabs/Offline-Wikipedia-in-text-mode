Red and blue are the most common colors in betta fish. Some people think that white, black, and green bettas are rare. Before a male Betta splendens begins to mate with a female, the male betta will create a nest of bubbles by blowing mucus-coated bubbles towards the surface of the water. == Behavior == If betta fish are kept in a small area, the males will fight each other. Bettas will also nip (bite) the fins of some fish. If a male betta engages with an opponent male, the betta will make his fins flare up, position his gill covers outwards, and move his tail in a lateral beating movement. They can also get aggressive if they see their own reflection. ==References== Category:Teleosts Category:Freshwater fish Category:Aquarium fish",
