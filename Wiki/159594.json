 "text": "The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) electrified urban railway lines in Liverpool and Manchester in order to improve the service offered against the competition being put up by new electric trams. ==Liverpool== ===Liverpool to Southport=== The line between Liverpool and Southport began using electric multiple units (EMUs) on 22 March 1904. Power was supplied from a third rail at 625 Volts direct current. ===Liverpool Overhead Railway=== Connections were built with the Liverpool Overhead Railway (LOR) at Seaforth & Litherland railway station to a new station beside LOR's Seaforth Sands station. Also from the North Mersey Branch route to Aintree. From 2 July 1905 LOR trains began to run through to Seaforth and Litherland. In 1906 the L&YR; electrified the line to Aintree. ===Liverpool to Ormskirk=== Electrification to Ormskirk was completed in 1913. ==Manchester== ===Bury to Holcombe Brook=== From 1913 an experimental electric service operated between Bury and Holcombe Brook. The equipment was provided by Dick, Kerr & Co. of Preston, which was developing its products for export. The system used was 3,500 Volts DC from overhead lines. In 1918 the line was converted to the 1,200 V DC system chosen for the Manchester to Bury line. ===Manchester to Bury=== After the Holcombe Brook service, the L&YR; decided to electrify the Manchester to Bury line. The system used was 1,200 V DC from a side-contact third rail. The purpose of this unusual arrangement was to prevent the service being affected by ice forming on the live rail. Sixty-six cars were built at Newton Heath works. The electrical equipment was supplied by Dick, Kerr & Co. The first public services ran on 17 April 1916, LYR",
