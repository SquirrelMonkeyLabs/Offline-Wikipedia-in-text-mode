He served in the position from 2006 to 2010, with a rank of Brigadier General. His predecessor in that position was Rabbi Israel Weiss. Rontzki was also the rosh yeshiva of the Hesder Yeshiva in the West Bank settlement Itamar. His four years in office have led to several controversies. Some of his statements upset not only secular Israelis, but led many organizations outside of Israel to accuse him of inciting terrorism. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Chief Military Rabbis of Israel Category:Deaths from colorectal cancer Category:People from Haifa",
