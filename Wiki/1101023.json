He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand as part of the stable The Bloodline. He is also known for his time in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he won the IWGP Tag Team Championship seven times, the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship three times and the ROH World Tag Team Championship one time. He was a member of Bullet Club and Guerrillas of Destiny (G.O.D.). During his first run in WWE from 2009 to 2014, Fifita competed under the ring name Camacho. He spent most of this time in a tag team with Hunico. After eight years in NJPW he returned to WWE in May 2024, where he became a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion with his brother Tama Tonga. His father also worked for WWE (then WWF) under the ring name Haku, while his brother and long-time Bullet Club partner Tama Tonga is also a part of WWE's Bloodline stable. ==Career== Before he became a professional wrestler, Fifita played football at the University of Texas at El Paso. He graduated from there with a degree in Liberal Arts with major in Communications Electronic Media and minor in criminal justice. ===WWE (2009–2014)=== Fiifta signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment on February 10, 2009 and was assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) where he competed under the ring name Tonga. Later in March, he joined the Washington's Secret Service stable under the ring name Agent T. where he competed alongside Agent D. and Agent J. After that was over, he changed his ring name to Donny Marlow and teamed with C.J. Parker. On July 21, 2011, Marlow and Parker defeated Calvin Raines and Big E Langston to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship but lost the Tag Team Championship to Brad Maddox and Briley Pierce on November 3. He debuted on the December 15, 2011 episode of Superstars as the enforcer of Hunico and went under the ring name Camacho. The two teamed together on the April 26 episode of Superstars and defeated The Usos. He made his pay-per-view debut at Over The Limit but was defeated in singles competition against Ryback. After that, he was sent back down to the developmental territory, the former FCW, which was rebranded into NXT. He debuted on NXT in a losing effort against Seth Rollins. He won a match later on the same episode in a six-man tag match when he teamed with Hunico and Michael McGillicutty against Rollins, Bo Dallas and Tyson Kidd. He defeated Kidd in a singles match following a distraction from McGillicutty on the following episode of NXT. He competed in the pre-show of Money in the Bank when he teamed with Hunico in a losing effort against the WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth in a non- title match. He made an appearance on the 1,000th episode of Raw with Hunico, Jinder Mahal, Curt Hawkins, Tyler Reks and Drew McIntyre when they tried to ambush Kane in the ring to make a statement but The Undertaker's return resulted in the Brothers of Destruction disposing of all six would-be attackers. When Hunico got injured, Camacho went back to NXT and attempted to collect a $5,000 bounty that was promised to anybody that could put Big E Langston \"on the shelf\". Camacho wanted to claim the bounty so he could \"get Hunico out of Mexico\" but lost to Langston. Camacho reunited with Hunico at the WrestleMania Axxess live event but he has not been on television since May. He teamed with Hunico to challenge for the NXT Tag Team Championship but were unsuccessful in winning the titles. On the November 6, 2013 episode of Main Event, he once again teamed with Hunico and they made their first televised tag team match since July 2012 against the Usos but lost. On June 12, 2014, Camacho was released from his WWE contract. ===Return to WWE (2024–present)=== As Tonga Loa, Fifita made his return to WWE at Backlash France on May 4, 2024. He helped Solo Sikoa and his brother Tama Tonga defeat Kevin Owens and Randy Orton in a Tag Team Street Fight and joined The Bloodline in doing so. On the August 23 episode of SmackDown, Loa got his first main roster title in WWE when he became one half of the WWE Tag Team Champions. Sikoa forced previous champion Jacob Fatu to give up his half the title to be Sikoa's personal enforcer. On October 25 he and Tonga lost their titles to The Motor City Machine Guns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley). ==Championships== *Florida Championship Wrestling **FCW Florida Tag Team Championship (one time) (with CJ Parker) * New Japan Pro-Wrestling ** IWGP Tag Team Championship (7 times) – with Tama Tonga ** NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (3 times) – with Bad Luck Fale and Tama Tonga (2), and Taiji Ishimori and Tama Tonga (1) ** World Tag League (2020) – with Tama Tonga * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** Ranked No. 97 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2019 ** Ranked No. 6 of the top 50 tag teams in the PWI Tag Team 50 in 2020 * Ring of Honor ** ROH World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tama Tonga * Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ** TNA Gut Check (2015) * WrestleCircus ** WC Big Top Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tama Tonga *WWE ** WWE Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tama Tonga == Footnotes == ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets Category:Sportspeople from Florida Category:WWE wrestlers",
