 "text": "Light beer is the name for beer that either has less alcohol, or fewer calories than regular beer. Light beer with less alcohol is made in a special process, either the fermentation is stopped, or the alcohol is later extracted. This is similar to making alcohol-free beer. Light beers are sometimes criticised, because some of them have \"less taste\" than regular beers. Light beers contain up to 30% less alcohol than regular beers. Regular beer contains between 4 and 6 percent alcohol by volume, light beer usually contains 2-3%. Large-scale production of light beers in the United States started in the mid-1970s. The first brewery to sell light beer was Coors Brewing Company, who sold Coors Light in the 1940s, during World War II. Beer with less alcohol is very popular in the United States. Category:Beer",
