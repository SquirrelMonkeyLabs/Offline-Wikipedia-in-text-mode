There are four zones in the maze - Medieval, Aztec, Futuristic and Industrial. In each zone, players attempt challenges to earn a crystal. Each crystal gives them five seconds in the Crystal Dome. After a while, the Industrial zone was replaced by an Ocean zone. ==Crystal dome== The Crystal Dome is a large glass crystal where the players must go in at the end. Small golden and silver tickets are blown around the dome and they must try and catch as many as they can. For every gold token they put in the box, they get a point. For every silver token they put in the box, they lose a point. If the team gets over 100 points, they win a big prize. If they do not win, they get a small crystal to take home with them. == Other websites == * Category:1990 British television series debuts Category:1990s British television series Category:2010s British television series Category:British television game shows Category:Channel 4 television programmes Category:English-language television programs",
