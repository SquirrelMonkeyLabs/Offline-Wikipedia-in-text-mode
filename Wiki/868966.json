 "text": "The 2021 Guinean coup d'état is a government takeover made by the armed forces of Guinea on 5 September 2021. The country's president, Alpha Condé, was arrested and removed from power after gunfire in the capital Conakry. Members of the special forces released a video showing Condé in captivity. The coup was led by special forces commander Mamady Doumbouya and he took power. Many people celebrated in the streets that Condé was removed from power. Doumbouya later created the National Committee of Reconciliation and Development (CNRD) making himself chair of the committee. He said that the CNRD would be in charge of the country for an 18-month transition period. On September 8, 2021, Guinea is suspended from ECOWAS proceedings by ECOWAS Heads of State meeting in a virtual extraordinary summit. On October 1, 2021, Doumbouya was sworn in as interim president. ==References== Category:2021 in Africa Category:Coups d'état 2021 coup d'état Category:September 2021 events",
