 "text": "\"Just Like You\" is the second single off of Canadian rock band Three Days Grace's first studio album Three Days Grace. The song was released on March 29, 2004. The song was able to make it to #2 on the Alternative Airplay, #4 on the Mainstream Rock, and #55 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song was certified Gold by both the Music Canada and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). When asked in an interview about the song, vocalist Adam Gontier said \"It's about being told how to live your life. When we were growing up, we saw it sort of first hand. A lot of our friends were pushed into doing jobs their parents were telling them to do. It's about being pushed around and told how to live your life and standing up for yourself.\". A music video for the song was released. In the video, multiple people are standing in a room wearing the exact same outfit and masks. They watch the band perform behind a two-way mirror also wearing the same masks. Guards are also standing by and when one of the people in the crowd start to move to the music, the guard stops him. Eventually the window shatters and the crowd takes their outfits and masks off and dance. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2004 songs Category:Three Days Grace songs Category:Hard rock songs",
