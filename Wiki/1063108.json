 "text": "Marawi, officially the Islamic City of Marawi (Maranao: Bandar a Marawi; ), is a city in the Philippines. It is the capital of the province of Lanao del Sur. According to the 2020 census, 207,010 people lived there. Marawi is located upon the shores of Lake Lanao. It is primarily inhabited by the Maranao people. The city is also called the \"Summer Capital of the South\" due to its higher elevation and cooler climate, a nickname it shares with Malaybalay. On May 23, 2017, the city suffered extensive damage during the Battle of Marawi as militants affiliated with the Islamic State invaded the city and engaged in a massive urban gunfight. The ensuing battle lasted until October 23, 2017, when Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced the ending of the battle. Major damage of the city was mostly caused by airstrikes carried out by the Philippine Air Force in an attempt to eliminate the militants. ==References== Category:Cities in the Philippines",
