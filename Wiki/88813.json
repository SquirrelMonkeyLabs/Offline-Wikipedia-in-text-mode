 "text": "Epsilon (uppercase/lowercase Ε ε), also referred to as e for short, is the letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the short \"e\" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 5. Letters that came from it include the Roman E and Cyrillic Е. It is also used in calculus to represent a very small number (particularly in proofs involving limit). In set theory, a typographical variant of epsilon can be used to represent the statement \"a is a member of set A\" (symbolically a \\in A). (A little fact: The Ypsilon is the only letter of the alphabet that you can divide into syllables: Y-psi-lon) == Related pages == * Delta * Limit of a sequence, where epsilon is used == References == Category:Greek alphabet Category:Vowel letters",
