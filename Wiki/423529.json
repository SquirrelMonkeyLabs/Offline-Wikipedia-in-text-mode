 "text": "Lythronax is an extinct genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur. It lived about 80 million years ago (mya) in what is now southern Utah. L. argestes is the oldest known tyrannosaurid based on its stratigraphic position. Loewen M.A. et al (2013). Tyrant dinosaur evolution tracks the rise and fall of late Cretaceous oceans. In Evans, David C. PLoS ONE 8 (11): e79420. Comparisons to its close relatives suggest that Lythronax would have been about long, with a weight of around and had a large skull filled with sharp teeth. The rostrumfront part of skull is comparatively short: it makes up less than two thirds of the total skull length. The whole skull is very broad, 0.4 times as wide as long. Overall, the skull is similar to that of Tyrannosaurus and Tarbosaurus. Its robust jaws have two sizes of teeth: its first five teeth are much larger than the other six. Behind the skull, the rest of the skeleton is similar to that of other tyrannosaurids. ==References== Category:Cretaceous dinosaurs Category:Dinosaurs of North America Category:Tyrannosaurids",
