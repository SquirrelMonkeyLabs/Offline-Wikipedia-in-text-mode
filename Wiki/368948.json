 "text": "José Doroteo Arango Arámbula (5 June 1878 – 20 July 1923), better known by his nickname Pancho Villa, was a Mexican revolutionary leader who advocated for the poor and wanted agrarian reform. Though he was a killer, a bandit, and a revolutionary leader, many remember him as a folk hero. Pancho Villa was also responsible for a raid on Columbus, New Mexico in 1916, which was the first attack on U.S. soil since 1812. \"Pancho\" was a revolutionary advocate for the less fortunate. == Death == Villa was assassinated on July 20, 1923. He had retired from his role as a revolutionary general and was living a quieter life on his ranch in Parral, Mexico. On that day, while driving his car with some companions, Villa was ambushed by a group of gunmen who fired over 40 shots at his vehicle. Villa and several of his men were killed in the attack. The exact reasons behind his murder are still debated, but many believe political motives were involved. Villa had many enemies, including former revolutionaries and government officials, who may have seen him as a threat even after his retirement. Some theories suggest that high-ranking politicians were behind the assassination to prevent Villa from gaining power again. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Assassinated Mexican people Category:Mexican generals",
