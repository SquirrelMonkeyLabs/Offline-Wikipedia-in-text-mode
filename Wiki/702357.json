 "text": "The Dissected Till Plains are physiographic parts of the Central Lowlands province. In turn, those are part of the Interior Plains physiographic part of the United States. They are in southern and western Iowa, northeastern Kansas, the southwestern corner of Minnesota, northern Missouri, eastern Nebraska, and southeastern South Dakota. The Dissected Till Plains were created during the Pre-Illinoian Stage. Glacial scouring and deposition by the Laurentide ice sheet and the later accumulation of loess during the Wisconsin Stage created the rolling hills and good, healthy dirt in the region. The region is also the western edge of the Corn Belt. ==References== Category:Geography of the United States",
