He came to Isfahan, which was under his brother's control, but he did not stay long and entered the Khuzestan region in January 1225.https://nek.istanbul.edu.tr/ekos/TEZ/ET003215.pdf ===Tushter=== When Celaleddin besieged the city of Tustar in Khuzestan, the city was governed by the caliph's slave, Emir Muzeffereddin Sungur, nicknamed \"Vech es-Subu\". While Celaleddin besieged the city, on the other hand, he wrote a letter to Muazzam, one of the Ayyubid kings, offering to act together against the caliph. However, Muazzam did not accept this. The Khwarezmian soldiers began plundering activities in the surrounding area. Some Khwarezmian soldiers reached settlements such as Badra and Baksa, and reached the surroundings of Basra. In response, the Basra commander, Emir Biltekin, attacked them and clashes broke out.https://nek.istanbul.edu.tr/ekos/TEZ/ET003215.pdf ===Sack of Basra=== When Emir Biltekin attacked the Khwarezms and killed some of them, Sultan Celaleddin besieged Basra for two months, but could not capture it. The siege of Tustar continued in this way for two months. However, as Celâleddin could not receive the support he wanted from the Ayyubid ruler Muazzam and as the ruler of the city, Muzafferüddin Sungur, took excellent measures to protect the city, Celâleddin was forced to leave the region.https://nek.istanbul.edu.tr/ekos/TEZ/ET003215.pdf ==References== Category:13th-century conflicts Category:History of Iraq Category:Wars involving Asia",
