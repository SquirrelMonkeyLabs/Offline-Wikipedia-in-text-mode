 "text": "Sazima's leaf frog (Phasmahyla jandaia) is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives in the mountains not far from the ocean. People have only seen higher than 1000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in the forests and grasslands on the Atlantic side of the mountains. People have seen it in streams. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over streams. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. This frog can make useful chemicals in its skin, but scientists do not think that anyone is catching this frog to take the chemicals. Scientists think this frog is not in danger of dying out because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. They say the only threat to this frog is mining. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
