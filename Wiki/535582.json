Currently, the Human Assets Index is used for this purpose. #A third index looks at how vulnerable the economy is as a whole. Currently, the Economic Vulnerability Index is used.

The UN looks at indicators, such as gross national income, nutrition, health, education and literacy. Economic vulnerability is recorded on the Economic Vulnerability Index. LDC criteria are reviewed every three years. Countries may stop being considered an LDC when indicators show that they have become developed enough. Since the LDC category was created, four countries have graduated to developing country status. The first country to do this was Botswana in 1994. The second was Cape Verde, in 2007.\"UN advocate salutes Cape Verdeâ€™s graduation from category of poorest States\", UN News Centre, 14 June 2007.
