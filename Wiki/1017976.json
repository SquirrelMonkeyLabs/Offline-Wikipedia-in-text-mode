The story is about two main characters named Abhinaya and Vetri. In the first part of the show, Abhinaya is a traditional girl who follows her customs and traditions. She meets Vetri, who is a rebellious person and doesn't understand the importance of traditions and marriage. During an argument at a temple, Vetri unexpectedly ties a sacred thread called \"thali\" around Abhinaya's neck. The story follows their journey as they try to overcome their differences and discover love. The second part takes place six years later. Vetri has been in prison for a crime he committed. When he is released, he tries to find Abhinaya but learns that she has moved far away and had an abortion, ending their unborn child's life. Two years pass, and Abhinaya has become an important government official, while Vetri has become a notorious troublemaker due to his grief over their child's fate. However, Abhinaya actually didn't abort the child, and she is determined to keep Vetri away from their daughter Sudar. The story focuses on how Sudar brings her parents back together. == Plot == === Part 1 (Episodes 1-454) === There was a smart woman named Abhinaya who liked to follow her family's customs. One day, she met a rough guy named Vetri who didn't understand how important it was to follow the proper rules for getting married. Abhinaya helped a couple get married in a temple, and that's when a fortune teller came and said that Abhinaya would marry a troublemaker, even if she didn't believe it. Abhinaya was trying to help a couple who got married secretly. While they were arguing, Vetri got angry and put a special necklace called a thaali around Abhinaya's neck. He felt sorry for it later, though. Abhinaya's father and Vetri were upset when they forced her to go live in a poor area as a newlywed, even though she was surprised and sad about it. Vetri didn't listen when Abhinaya tried to explain the meaning of love to him. But Abhinaya discovered the truth about Vetri and why he changed so suddenly. She also found out that her friend Radha secretly loved Vetri. As time went on, Vetri and Abhinaya went through many ups and downs that brought them closer together. Vetri even said that he liked Abhinaya when she was taken away. But they were not allowed to enter their house. However, Vetri's other family members agreed to let them live on the terrace next to the house. Will Vetri and Abhinaya be accepted as a couple and live together? That's the big question. The rest of the story is about whether they can solve their problems and be together. === Part 2 (from Episode 455) === Abhi and Vetri were apart for a long time, but now they meet each other again. Something called destiny gives them another opportunity to be together. Will the same things that happened before happen again? ==== 6 years later ==== In Andhra Pradesh, Abhi is now a collector, whereas Vetri was recently let out of prison after serving his time. When he is released from prison, he wants to visit Abhi and his daughter but learns that Abhi has moved away and that his daughter was aborted. As a result, Vetri adopts new negative habits and returns to his previous brash behaviour. ==== 2 years later ==== After a big fight with a powerful person in Andhra Pradesh, a person named Abhi is transferred by the government back to Kanchipuram. In Kanchipuram, it is discovered that Abhi did not end the life of her child named Sudar, who is still alive. Meanwhile, a person named Vetri becomes a troublemaker in his hometown of Kanchipuram. One day, a riot breaks out at a temple and Abhi orders Vetri to open it, but Vetri disobeys. After 8 years, Abhi learns about the riot and tries to stop it. This leads to Abhi having Vetri arrested, but Vetri is released on bail with the help of Kanmani, a girl whom Vetri educated to become a lawyer and who has feelings for Vetri. After the legal case is resolved, Vetri challenges Abhi to defeat him, while another person named Nandhini wants to confess to Abhi that she killed someone named Bhavani. However, Vetri interrupts and tells Nandhini to leave. Paramu is planning to have Vetri killed because Vetri killed Paramu's twin brother, Bhavani. Paramu sends his gang to attack Vetri, but Sudar warns Vetri about the danger. Vetri fights off the gang members, but Sudar gets hurt in the process.
