 "text": "The Chorleywood bread process was invented at the British Baking Industries Research Association at Chorleywood in 1961. Compared to traditional bread- making processes, it uses more yeast, added fats, chemicals, and high-speed mixing to allow the dough to be made with lower-protein wheat. The bread is made in a shorter time. In 2009, 80% of bread made in the United Kingdom was made this way. It uses dough conditioners. These are usually oxidizing agents such ascorbic acid or potassium bromate.The high-speed mixing process takes less than 5 minutes. The mixer operates at hundreds of revolutions per minute. It has been criticised as producing unhealthy ultra-processed food. ==References== Category:Breads Category:Baking",
