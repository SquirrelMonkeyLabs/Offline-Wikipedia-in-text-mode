 "text": "Femininity (also called womanhood or womanliness) is a set of traits, behaviors, and roles associated with females. Femininity is made up of both social and biological factors. This makes it different from the female sex, as women, men, and transgender people can all exhibit feminine traits. The colour pink is associated with femininity in western culture. Femininity is also present through certain natural instincts and traits like the widening of the hips in females to support the baby in the womb during pregnancy. Reproduction, development of breasts, and higher-pitched voice are examples of feminine biology in human beings. Category:Women Category:Gender Category:Cultural anthropology",
