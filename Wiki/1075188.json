 "text": "The Seated Buddha from Gandhara is the oldest surviving statue of the Buddha in the world. It was found in Jamal Garhi, ancient Gandhara, in modern-day Pakistan. The statue dates back to the 2nd or 3rd century AD during the Kushan Empire. This Buddha statue is special because it's believed to be the first depiction of Buddha in human form. Before this time, Buddha was usually represented by aniconic symbols. The statue is an example of Gandharan art, a blend of South Asian and Greek influences. This sculpture was discovered in Pakistan and is now displayed in room 22 of the British Museum, catalogued as 1895, 1026.1.Seated Buddha from Gandhara , British Museum Highlights, accessed January 2024. == Description and History == The statue was made from schist, a type of stone that allows for very detailed carvings. It depicts Buddha's first sermon at the deer park in Sarnath. Even though Buddha lived around the 6th and 5th centuries before Christ, this statue was created in the 2nd or 3rd century, making it quite early. Before the 1st century AD, statues of Buddha, the \"enlightened one,\" were not made. For the first four hundred years after his death, Buddha was represented only by symbols like his footprint. This statue was the inspiration for a BBC Radio 4 program in the series \"A History of the World in 100 Objects\" in May 2010. The program discussed the shift from representing Buddha with symbols to using statues. The Buddha figure is shown seated on a cushion on a throne or platform. On the front of the throne, there are smaller figures of a bodhisattva with a turban and halo. Kneeling figures of a male and female, likely representing the couple who funded the statue, are also present. == References == Category:Gandhara Category:Buddhism Category:History of Pakistan Category:Ancient culture of Pakistan",
