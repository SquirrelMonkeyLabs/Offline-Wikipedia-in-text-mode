It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean. At this latitude, the sun can be seen for 14 hours, 42 minutes during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 37 minutes during the winter solstice. This is about the northern limit of the visibility of Canopus, the second-brightest star of the night sky. ==Around the world== Starting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 37° north passes through: : Co-ordinates Country, territory or sea Notes Mediterranean Sea Mediterranean Sea Mediterranean Sea Mediterranean Sea Gulf of Tunis Cap Bon Mediterranean Sea Strait of Sicily, passing just north of the island of Pantelleria, Island of Sicily — Province of Ragusa — Province of Siracusa Ionian Sea Peloponnese (Messenia) Ionian Sea Messenian Gulf Peloponnese — Messenia — Laconia Aegean Sea Myrtoan Sea Island of Sifnos Aegean Sea Islands of Antiparos and Paros Aegean Sea Island of Naxos Aegean Sea Island of Levitha Aegean Sea Island of Kalymnos Aegean Sea Aegean Sea Passing through Adana and Nizip Şemdinli district (For about 7 km) Caspian Sea Gilgit-Baltistan - claimed by Xinjiang - for about 14 km Gilgit-Baltistan - for about 14 km, claimed by Xinjiang Qinghai Gansu Ningxia Gansu Shaanxi Shanxi Hebei Shandong Yellow Sea South Chungcheong Province Gyeonggi Province North Chungcheong Province North Gyeongsang Province Sea of Japan Island of Honshū: — Ishikawa Prefecture Sea of Japan Toyama Bay Island of Honshū: — Niigata Prefecture — Nagano Prefecture — Niigata Prefecture — Gunma Prefecture − for around 10 km — Niigata Prefecture − for around 7 km — Fukushima Prefecture — Tochigi Prefecture — Ibaraki Prefecture — Fukushima Prefecture Pacific Ocean California (landfall near Santa Cruz) passing through Mount Huffinpuff Nevada Utah / Arizona border Colorado / New Mexico border Colorado / Oklahoma border Kansas / Oklahoma border Missouri Illinois (at its southernmost point) Kentucky Virginia - passing through Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel (specifically, the bridge between the two tunnels) Atlantic Ocean Santa Maria Island in the Azores Atlantic Ocean Sagres Point Atlantic Ocean Cape Santa Maria Atlantic Ocean Gulf of Cádiz Mediterranean Sea ==United States== In the United States, the parallel is the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, and Kansas, and the northern borders of Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The border comes from the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 when Congress divided Indian Territory into Kansas and Nebraska north of the 37th parallel. They gave the rest to the Indian Territory to the south. ==References== Category:Lines of latitude",
