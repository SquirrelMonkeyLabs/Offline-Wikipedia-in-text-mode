 "text": "Walgoolan is a small town in the eastern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. It is between Merredin and Bodallin along the Great Eastern Highway. Walgoolan was started between 1895 and 1899. It began as a railroad siding. Land was set aside for a townsite in 1913. Lots were surveyed in 1922. The townsite was gazetted in 1923. The name of the town is Aboriginal and means place where the short bushes grow. After World War I, nearly 100 settlers took land in the area. They planted cereal crops, mostly wheat. In 1932, Emu War, started in Walgoolan. The Great Depression and many droughts hurt the area. By 1940 there was only one shop and the townsite was abandoned soon after. By 2010 only 10 families remain in the district. Category:Towns in Western Australia",
