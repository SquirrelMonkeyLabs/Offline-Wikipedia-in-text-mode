 "text": "Rubus, commonly known as brambles is a large and diverse genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, and subfamily Rosoideae, with over 1,350 species. * * * ==Overview== Raspberries, blackberries, and dewberries are common. Bristleberries are endemic to North America. Most of these plants have woody stems with prickles. Gland-tipped hairs are also common. The word \"cane fruit\" (or \"cane berry\") applies to any Rubus species or hybrid. They are commonly grown with supports, such as wires or canes This includes hybrids such as loganberry, boysenberry, marionberry and tayberry. The stems of these plants are referred to as canes. ==Characteristics== Bramble bushes typically grow as shrubs, despite a few being herbaceous, with their stems being typically covered in sharp thorns, spines, and prickles. They grow long, arching shoots that readily form roots when they contact with soil. New shoots grow in the spring from this rootstock. The leaves are either evergreen or deciduous, and simple, lobed, or compound. The shoots typically do not flower or set fruit until the second year of growth, i.e. they are biennial. The rootstock is perennial. Most species are hermaphrodites with male and female parts being present on the same flower. Bramble fruits are aggregate fruits formed from smaller units called drupelets. ===Genetics=== 60‒70% of species of Rubus are polyploid, which have more than two pairs of each chromosome, with species ranging in ploidy from diploid (2×, with 14 chromosomes) to tetradecaploid (14×). ==References== Category:Rubus",
