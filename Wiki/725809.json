 "text": "Diophantine approximation is a branch of number theory originally created by Diophantus for estimating any given real number as a ratio of two integers. Much of the current research into this topic is on whether or not this theory can be applied to algebraic numbers. Diophantine approximation is useful in a variety of areas in number theory, so this method is often used. ==References== Category:Number theory",
