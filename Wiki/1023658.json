 "text": "A submersible is a ship that can go underwater and can work underwater. They are normally designed for underwater work and exploring. A submersible is different from a submarine. Submarines are bigger and are able to do more underwater than submersibles. Submersibles have been able to dive over 10km (33,000ft) below the sea's surface. There are many different types of submersibles, including human occupied vehicles (HOVs) - vehicles that bring a small group of scientists, pilots and electronic equipment down to the bottom of the sea to explore.
