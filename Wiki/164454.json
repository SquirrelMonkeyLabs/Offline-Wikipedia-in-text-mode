 "text": "In object-oriented programming, a method is a part of an object. A method allows the object to perform an action, whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value. An example is: public int getOne() { return 1; } This syntax is the same in different programming languages such as Java and C#. The `public` identifier means that this method is publicly accessible, that anyone is allowed to use this. In comparison, a method may be `private` or sometimes `protected`, protected means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method, and never a human user. A privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to, to edit it. This is used to give data security. The `int` identifier means that the return type is an integer value.
