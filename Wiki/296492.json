 "text": "The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation. It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979. The Pritzker family pays for the prize. It is the top prize in architecture, and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture. The country, race, religion or political ideas of the architect are not important. Winners get US$100,000 and a certificate. Winners receive a medal. The back of the medal has these words in Latin—firmitas, utilitas, venustas (English: durability, utility, and beauty). The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money. ==Selection== Martha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009. The director asks many people, including past winners, academics, critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners. Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year. In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it. Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring. ==Winners== The first winner was Philip Johnson. The award was \"for 50 years of imagination and vitality\" shown by the many \"museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures\". The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryūe Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44. The most recent winner, in 2019, is Arata Isozaki. ==List of prize winners== Year Laureate Nationality Example work (year completed) Example work (year completed) Ceremony location Ref(s) 1979 Glass House (1949) Dumbarton Oaks 1980 Torres de Satélite (1957) Dumbarton Oaks 1981 Seeley Historical Library (1968) National Building Museum 1982 Knights of Columbus Building (1969) Art Institute of Chicago 1983 National Gallery of Art, East Building (1978) Metropolitan Museum of Art 1984 High Museum of Art (1983) National Gallery of Art 1985 Abteiberg Museum (1982) The Huntington Library 1986 Iglesia Youth Center Library (1968) Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths 1987 St. Mary's Cathedral, Tokyo (1964) Kimbell Art Museum 1988 Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library (1963) Art Institute of Chicago 1988 Cathedral of Brasília (1958) Art Institute of Chicago 1989 Walt Disney Concert Hall (1999–2003) Tōdai-ji 1990 Bonnefanten Museum (1990) Palazzo Grassi 1991 National Gallery (London), Sainsbury Wing (1991) Palacio de Iturbide 1992 Pavilion of Portugal in Expo'98 (1998) Harold Washington Library 1993 Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (1991) Prague Castle 1994 French Embassy, Berlin (2003) The Commons, Columbus, Indiana 1995 Nagaragawa Convention Center (1995) Palace of Versailles 1996 Kursaal Palace (1999) Getty Center 1997 Norwegian Glacier Museum (1991) Guggenheim Museum Bilbao 1998 Kansai International Airport (1994) White House 1999 Millennium Bridge (London) (2000) Altes Museum 2000 Casa da Música (2003) Jerusalem Archaeological Park 2001 Herzog & de Meuron Tate Modern (2000) Monticello 2002 Berowra Waters Inn (1983) Michelangelo's Campidoglio 2003 Sydney Opera House (1973) Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando 2004 Bridge Pavilion (2008) Hermitage Museum 2005 San Francisco Federal Building (2007) Pritzker Pavilion, Millennium Park 2006 Saint Peter Chapel, São Paulo (1987) Dolmabahçe Palace 2007 Lloyd's building (1986) Banqueting House, Whitehall 2008 Torre Agbar (2005) Library of Congress 2009 Therme Vals (1996) Legislative Palace of the City Council, Buenos Aires 2010 Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa (SANAA) 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa (2003) Ellis Island 2011 Eduardo Souto de Moura Estádio Municipal de Braga, Braga (2004) Andrew W.
