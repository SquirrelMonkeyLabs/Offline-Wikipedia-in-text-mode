 "text": "Athelred II (13 March 968 — 23 April 1016) nicknamed the Unready was the King of England twice. The first time was from 978 until in 1013 where a Viking king, Sweyn I of Denmark, overthrew him. The second time was from Sweyn's death in 1014 until Athelred's death in 1016. He was the son of Edgar and his second wife, Ælfthryth. He succeded his older half-brother, Edward II, in 978 when Athelred was only ten years old. During his reign, he had to fight against Viking invaders in England. His nickname \"Unready\" means \"Unread\" which was a nickname for \"Poorly Counciled\" or \"Poorly Advised,\" because he was given poor council when he solicited opinions from his advisors. == Other websites == * Family tree of Ethelred the Unready * Documentary - The Making of England: Aethelred the Unready * Early British Kingdoms * Britannia : Monarchs Category:968 births Category:1016 deaths Category:Kings and Queens of England",
