 "text": "Rush is a Canadian rock band originally formed in August 1968, in the Willowdale neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, currently comprised of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer and songwriter Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of changes between 1968 and 1974, achieving their definitive form when Neil Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974. The band released its self-titled debut album in March 1974, after which followed 19 additional studio recordings, 8 live albums and 6 compilations. As a group, Rush has made 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. According to the RIAA, Rush's number of sales place them fourth behind The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Aerosmith for the most gold or platinum albums one after another by a rock band. Rush also ranks 78th in U.S. album sales with 25 million items sold. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single person or group, as of 2004 some people guessed that Rush's total worldwide album sales is over 40 million items sold. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== Year Album details Peak chart positions Certifications (sales thresholds) CAN FIN GER IRE NLD NOR POL SWE UK US 1974 Rush * Released: March 18, 1974 * Label: Mercury 88 — — — — — — — — 105 US: GoldRIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by Rush .
