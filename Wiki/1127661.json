 "text": "Molidae is a family of giant ray-finned fish that include the famous ocean sunfish and others. They are part of the order Tetraodontiformes. == Description == The molas are different from other fishes. Instead, they have a large body looking like a giant fish head. They have the fewest vertebrae of any fish, with only 16 in Mola mola. Their skeleton is made of cartilage, much like a shark. They eat mushy animals like jellyfish and salps. == Genera == === Extant === * Genus Masturus Gill, 1884 ** Masturus lanceolatus (Li√©nard, 1840 \\- sharptail mola * Genus Mola Blyth, 1860 ** Mola mola Linnaeus, 1758 \\- ocean sunfish ** Mola alexandrini Giglioli, 1883 \\- giant sunfish ** Mola tecta Nyegaard et al., 2017 \\- hoodwinker sunfish * Genus Ranzania Nardo, 1840 ** Ranzania laevis Pennant, 1776 \\- slender sunfish === Extinct === * Eomola bimaxillaria * Austromola angerhoferi == References == # Tyler, James C.; Bannikov, Alexandre F.
