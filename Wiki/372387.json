The words of Willis' citation explain: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and > beyond the call of duty as Platoon Corpsman serving with the 3d Battalion, > 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, during operations against enemy Japanese > forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, 28 February 1945. Constantly imperiled > by artillery and mortar fire from strong and mutually supporting pillboxes > and caves studding Hill 362 in the enemy's cross-island defenses, Willis > resolutely administered first aid to the many marines wounded during the > furious close-in fighting until he himself was struck by shrapnel and was > ordered back to the battle-aid station. Without waiting for official medical > release, he quickly returned to his company and, during a savage hand-to- > hand enemy counterattack, daringly advanced to the extreme frontlines under > mortar and sniper fire to aid a marine lying wounded in a shellhole. > Completely unmindful of his own danger as the Japanese intensified their > attack, Willis calmly continued to administer blood plasma to his patient, > promptly returning the first hostile grenade which landed in the shell-hole > while he was working and hurling back 7 more in quick succession before the > ninth exploded in his hand and instantly killed him. By his great personal > valor in saving others at the sacrifice of his own life, he inspired his > companions, although terrifically outnumbered, to launch a fiercely > determined attack and repulse the enemy force. His exceptional fortitude and > courage in the performance of duty reflect the highest credit upon Willis > and the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. ==Namesake== John Willis is the namesake of the destroyer escort ship USS John Willis (DE-1027) which was named in his honor.Naval Historical Center, \"Pharmacist's Mate First Class John H.
