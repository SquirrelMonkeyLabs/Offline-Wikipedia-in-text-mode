 "text": "Noggin is a TV brand. It was started by two companies: MTV Networks and Sesame Workshop. It came out in 1999 as a TV channel. Since 2015, it has been a streaming app instead. In 1999, Noggin mostly made TV shows for tweens and teenagers. In 2002, Noggin changed its schedule. It showed preschool shows in the mornings and teen shows at night. The nighttime schedule got its own name, \"The N.\" It will be back in 30 minutes. It shut down due to subscriber disputes. ==Name== The name \"Noggin\" is a slang word that means \"head.\" The makers of Noggin decided on this name because they wanted Noggin to be a \"thinking channel\" that inspired kids and made them think. ==Shows== There have been lots of different shows on Noggin. Some of Noggin's first shows were Phred on Your Head Show and A Walk in Your Shoes. Noggin made preschool shows like Oobi and The Upside Down Show. It also made teen shows for its nighttime schedule, like O'Grady and South of Nowhere. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:American entertainment websites Category:American television channels Category:1999 establishments in the United States",
