 "text": "People who are very poor and who cannot even cover their basic needs, such as getting a place where they live, or food, sometimes trade sexual intercourse to cover these needs. This practice is called survival sex. The term is used by sex trade, poverty researchers, and aid workers. Very often, people who engage in survival sex are homeless. Sometimes, survival sex is used to get illegal drugs. Survival sex is common throughout the world. It has been studied in many countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, Colombia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa. Researchers estimate that of homeless youth in North America, one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in Los Angeles, about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex. People who have been homeless for a longer time, who have become victims, or who have become criminals are more likely to engage in survival sex. This is also true for people who have attempted suicide, who are pregnant, or those who have a STI. Survival sex is common in refugee camps. In Uganda, 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflicts between Ugandan government forces and the militant Lord's Resistance Army. Many of them live in refugee camps in northern Uganda. Human Rights Watch reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls in these camps were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers. == Related pages == * Sexual capital ==References== Category:Poverty Category:Prostitution",
