 "text": "Fermat's primality test is an algorithm. It can test if a given number p is probably prime. There is a flaw however: There are numbers that pass the test, and that are not prime. These numbers are called Carmichael numbers. ==Concept== Fermat's little theorem states that if p is prime and 1 \\le a < p, then :a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}. If we want to test if n is prime, then we can pick random a's in the interval and see if the equation above holds. If the equality does not hold for a value of a, then n is composite (not prime). If the equality does hold for many values of a, then we can say that n is probably prime, or a pseudoprime. It may be in our tests that we do not pick any value for a such that the equality fails. Any a such that :a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} when n is composite is known as a Fermat liar. If we do pick an a such that :a^{n-1} ot\\equiv 1 \\pmod{n} then a is known as a Fermat witness for the compositeness of n. \\pmod n is the modulo operation. Its result is what remains, if p is divided by n. As an example, : 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3. ==What this test is used for== The RSA algorithm for public-key encryption can be done in such a way that it uses this test. This is useful in cryptography.
