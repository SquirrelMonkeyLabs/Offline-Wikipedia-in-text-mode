 "text": "Bomberman is a series of video games created by Hudson Soft, now owned by Konami, and still has many games released to this day. Bomberman is also the name of the character himself, who is the subject of the games. Most of these games revolve around him escaping a maze or solving a puzzle using bombs, defeating enemies, and reaching the end goal, whether a door or a solved puzzle. Bomberman is also known for its multiplayer mode, in which anywhere from 2 to 64 players can fight to the death to determine the winner. One wins when they are the last one standing. Collectible items have multiple effects, from increasing maximum bombs at once, to increasing explosion range of bombs, to even applying a negative effect to the player, like causing them to spin rapidly or throw bombs endlessly, usually resulting in the players death. Only a few games have strayed from the simple 2d formula, with good examples being the Nintendo 64 games, in which Bomberman was played in 3rd person, and used bombs to solve puzzles like unlocking waterways and opening gates. ==List of Bomberman games== Title Year Platforms Notes Bomberman 1983 MSX, ZX Spectrum, Sharp MZ-700 MSX-only release in Japan, release for both systems in Europe as Eric and the Floaters. 3-D Bomberman 1984 MSX Uses first-person perspective.
