In November 2007, Ntetema wanted to know about a series of albino murders and their connection with witchdoctors. More than 90 percent of Tanzanians believe in witchcraft, so witch doctors are important in traditional African life. According to Ntetmea, more than 50 albinos were killed since 2007. Often, witchdoctors pay people to kill albinos. The police protect the killers. In July 2008, Ntetema's story was on the BBC. She received threats, so the BBC told her to get out. She went to London.
