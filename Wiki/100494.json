 "text": "Valverde is a province of the Dominican Republic. It is in the northwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Mao. It was created on 1959. It was a municipality of the Santiago province before being elevated to the category of province. ==Name== The province was named Valverde after José Desiderio Valverde, an officer of the Dominican army when the Dominican-Haitian War. Later, he was President of the Dominican Republic for one year (July 1857 - August 1858). He was from Santiago de los Caballeros. ==History== Very few people lived in the lands of the Valverde province because it is very dry; there were only some people raising cattle in large ranches. The Spanish word for those ranches was Hato and there are many places in the province with the word \"Hato\" in their names (Hato del Yaque, Hato Nuevo, Hato Viejo, Hato del Medio) or \"Hatico\" (small \"Hato\"). The road from the border with Haiti to Santiago de los Caballeros, the second most important city of the country, went across this region and during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856), Haitian armies came across this region and people did not want to live here. In 1918, a Belgian engineer, Luis L. Bogaert (\"Monsieur Bogaert\"), built a canal to take water from the river to the fields and he began to grow rice. That was an important change in the province and now Valverde is a province where rice is an important product. Since the Dominican Independence, the territory was part of the Santiago province. It was made a province in 1959 with lands of the Santiago and the Monte Cristi provinces, with the municipality of Esperanza; in 1978, Laguna Salada became a municipality of the province. The municipal districts of the province were created in: * 1998: Ámina * 1999: Jaibónand Maizal * 2000: Jicomé * 2001: Pueblo Nuevo and La Caya * 2002: Cruce de Guayacanes * 2005: Boca de Mao * 2006: Paradero ==Location== The Valverde province is in the northwest part of the Cibao valley.
