Like all huntsman spiders, the legs of the giant huntsman spider are long compared to the body, and twist forward in a crab-like way. It is the largest member of the Sparassidae, with a 30 centimeter (12 inches) leg-span, and 4.6 centimeter body-length. The largest known member of the Sparassidae known prior to the discovery of H. maxima was the Australian Beregama aurea (L.
