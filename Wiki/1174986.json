 "text": "Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) is a technology that uses fiber optic cables to measure temperature along the entire length of the fiber. It provides continuous, real-time temperature monitoring for industrial, environmental, and safety applications. == How DTS works == DTS systems use Raman scattering in optical fibers to measure temperature changes. The system sends laser pulses through the fiber, and light scatters back in two different wavelengths: *Stokes signal: Temperature-dependent *Anti-Stokes signal: Changes in intensity based on temperature variations By analyzing these signals, the system can determine precise temperature values at different points along the fiber. == Applications of DTS == DTS is widely used in various industries, including: *Oil & Gas Pipelines: Detecting leaks and monitoring pipeline integrity. *Power Cables & Electrical Grids: Preventing overheating and failures. *Fire Detection: Identifying early signs of fire in tunnels and large structures. *Geothermal & Environmental Monitoring: Measuring temperature variations underground. *Industrial Processes: Controlling temperature in chemical and manufacturing plants. == Advantages of DTS == *Long-range temperature sensing (up to several kilometers). *Continuous real-time monitoring along the entire fiber. *Immune to electromagnetic interference, unlike electrical sensors. *Uses existing fiber optic infrastructure, reducing installation costs. == Related Technologies == DTS is part of a larger group of fiber optic sensing technologies, including: *Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) â€“ Uses fiber optics to detect sound and vibration. == References == * * *",
