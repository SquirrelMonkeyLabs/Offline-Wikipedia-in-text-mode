 "text": "Alice Sebold (born September 6, 1963) is an American writer. Her three published books are Lucky (1999), The Lovely Bones (2002) and The Almost Moon (2007). Lucky is a memoir and describes an experience of rape. The bestselling The Lovely Bones was made into a 2009 movie. The movie was directed by Peter Jackson. Sebold was born in Madison, Wisconsin. She married writer Glen David Gold in 2001. The couple have since divorced. She lives in San Francisco, California. Sebold says that she was raped when she was 18 during her college years, and it was believed without question until 2021, when Timothy Mucciante, the executive producer of the film adaptation of Lucky, felt that her story did not make sense and hired private investigators to look into it. Anthony Broadwater, the man she accused of raping her, was cleared of the crime when the Supreme Court said the evidence against him made no sense and that he was innocent and wrongfully jailed. Broadwater is African-American, and controversy followed as people believed Sebold had lied on purpose to punish a black person for a crime they did not commit racist reasons. This has happened many times before to other black men falsely accused of raping white women and punished, and people saw this incident as another example of it. Whether or not she was actually raped has been called into question as a result. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American novelists Category:Writers from Madison, Wisconsin",
