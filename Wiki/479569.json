 "text": "Tetraplegia (or quadriplegia) is a condition in which someone loses use of all limbs and the torso. It usually affects both the ability to move and the use of the senses. ==Name== Quadriplegia is the common term in North America. Tetraplegia is the term in Europe. ==Causes== Tetraplegia is caused by damages either to the brain or to the spinal cord at the level of the cervical vertebrae. People with an injury at the C1 vertebra may lose functions from the neck down. They may need a machine to breathe for them. People with injuries at the C7 vertebra may still be able to use their arms and hands. ==References== Category:Disorders Category:Disability",
