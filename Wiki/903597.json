 "text": "The House of slaves is a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade. It is located on Gorée Island, off the coast of Dakar, Senegal. In 1962 it was made a museum. Historians have different opinions on how important Gorée Island actually was and how many slaves were shipped from there to the Americas. The house was constructed in 1776, to hold slaves to be exported. Anna Colas Pépin, an African businesswoman who took part in the slave trade, owned it. Category:Historic slave trade",
