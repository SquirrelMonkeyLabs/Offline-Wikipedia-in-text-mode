 "text": "The stripe-throated rocket frog (Leucostethus brachistriatus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground near streams in forests on the hills near the Andes Mountains. Scientists saw them about 1500 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected, for example Ucumari Regional Reserve and Barbas-Bremen Ecological Corridor. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. But people cut down the forests where it lives to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
