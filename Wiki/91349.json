 "text": "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out is the first album made by the rock band, Panic! at the Disco. It was released on July 18, 2006 by Fueled by Ramen. The album is split in two, with tracks 1 through 7 being played by electronic instruments such as synthesizers and drum machines and tracks 9 through 13 using traditional instruments such as the accordion and organ. Track 8 (Intermission) acts as a link between the two parts, starting with techno- style dance beats before switching to the piano. On the vinyl record version of the album, side A holds songs 1-8 while side B holds songs 9-13, further showing the split in the album. The album mostly deals with social problems that the band shows on through various songs. Topics such as sanctity of marriage, adultery, alcoholism, prostitution, and religion are seen throughout the album. Guitarist Ryan Ross also relates two of the songs to living with an alcoholic father. The album has sold more than 1.6 million copies in the U.S. alone. == Track listing == #\"Introduction\" – 0:36 #\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage\" – 2:54 #\"London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines\" – 3:23 #\"Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks\" – 3:23 #\"Camisado\" – 3:11 #\"Time to Dance\" – 3:22 #\"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\" – 3:20 #\"Intermission\" – 2:35 #\"But It's Better If You Do\" – 3:25 #\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\" – 3:06 #\"I Constantly Thank God for Esteban\" – 3:30 #\"There's a Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought of It Yet\" – 3:16 #\"Build God, Then We'll Talk\" – 3:40 === Bonus tracks === 14. \"I Write Sins Not Tragedies (Live in Denver)\" (Japanese Bonus track) – 3:46 == Credits == *Brendon Urie – vocals, guitar, keyboard, piano, accordion, organ *Ryan Ross – guitar, lyrics, keyboard, piano, accordion, organ *Spencer Smith – drums, and percussion *Brent Wilson - bass (Panic now denies he performed on the album but his name is shown in the credits for the album's Notes and Thank Yous) Additional instruments *William Brousserd - trumpet on tracks 9,12 *Heather Stebbins - cello on tracks 8,10,12,13 *Samantha Bynes - violin on tracks 10,12 ==Related pages== * Panic at the Disco == References == == Other websites == * Category:Debut albums Category:Panic! at the Disco albums Category:2005 albums Category:Rock albums",
