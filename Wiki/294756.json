Vim is an improved version of the vi text editor, an editor created by Bill Joy in 1976. Vim is free, and the source code is publicly available on GitHub. It is available in multiple languages, and it works on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Vim can be used from either a command-line interface or a graphical user interface. While Vim can be hard to use, there are built-in commands new users can learn from reading the Vim user manual, running the `:help` command in Vim, or using the `vimtutor` command in a terminal. Vim is widely popular because it allows users to perform many functions on a document (save, search, scroll, etc.) by pressing as few keys as possible. However, many critics argue that these keystrokes are confusing. One can customize Vim using a .vimrc file. To add new features like keyboard shortcuts, one can use Vim script,Rosset, C. (2013).
