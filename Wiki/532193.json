It is an extinct genus from the Upper Jurassic deposits of western Liaoning, China.Juramaia sinensis - 160-million- year-old fossil pushes back mammal evolution A nearly complete skeleton, with an incomplete skull with full dentition was found. It was collected in the Daxigou site, Jianchang, from the Tiaojishan Formation. It is dated at about 160 million years ago. Electronic supplementary material The discovery of Juramaia provides new insight into the evolution of eutherian mammals. It shows their lineage diverged from that of the marsupials 35 million years earlier than previously thought. Furthermore, its discovery fills gaps in the fossil record and helps to calibrate modern, DNA-based methods of dating the evolution.\"Fossil redefines mammal history\" BBC NewsDiscovery of a 160-million-year-old fossil represents a new milestone in early mammal evolution The forelimb bones have climbing adaptations, so it is suggested that the basal stock of Eutheria was arboreal. == Related pages == * Eomaia * Sinodelphys == References == Category:Extinct mammals Category:Fossils Category:Jurassic",
