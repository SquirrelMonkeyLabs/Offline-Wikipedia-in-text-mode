 "text": "The Sidewise Awards for Alternate History were established in 1995. These awards are for the best alternate history stories and novels of the year. The awards are named after the 1934 short story \"Sidewise in Time\" by Murray Leinster. In the story, a strange storm makes parts of the Earth exchange places with similar places from other timelines. Steven H Silver, Evelyn C. Leeper, and Robert B. Schmunk created the award. The number of judges has changed in different years. There have been three to eight judges, including judges in the UK and South Africa. There are two Sideways awards. The Short- Form award is for writing that is shorter than 60,000 words. The Long-Form award may be for writing that is longer than 60,000 words.
