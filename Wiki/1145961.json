 "text": "The Alban Hills (Latin: Albanus Mons) are a group of volcanic hills located about 20 kilometers southeast of Rome, in the region of Latium, central Italy. This area, known for its rich history and natural beauty, was considered a sacred location in Ancient Rome, home to significant religious sites and settlements. The ancient city of Alba Longa, a significant Latin settlement, was traditionally located in the Alban Hills.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226490502 == Geology == The Alban Hills are part of a dormant volcanic complex that formed approximately 600,000 years ago. It is composed of several volcanic peaks, with Monte Cavo being the highest at 949 meters. Though currently inactive, the complex last erupted around 5,000 years ago. The volcanic activity created fertile soil, making the region ideal for agriculture, and contributing to its importance in ancient Latium. The Alban Hills region features calderas that have filled with water over time, forming lakes such as Lake Albano and Lake Nemi, which are popular for recreation and scenic beauty. == Historical and cultural significance == The Alban Hills were historically significant as the center of the ancient Latin League, a confederation of Latin cities. The annual festival of the Latin League, known as the feriae Latinae, was held on the Alban Mount, a central peak where the Latin people gathered to worship Jupiter Latiaris and celebrate their shared heritage. The region is also associated with the legendary city of Alba Longa, considered the mother city of Rome. According to myth, Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, descended from the kings of Alba Longa.https://web.archive.org/web/20060602115410/http://www.ipcc.ch/activity/srccs/SRCCS_Chapter5.pdf During the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, the Alban Hills remained a religious and cultural center. Roman elites built villas here to escape the heat of Rome, attracted by the areaâ€™s cooler climate, scenic landscapes, and proximity to the capital. Emperor Domitian even constructed an imperial villa in the region, and remains of ancient Roman roads and villas are still visible today. == Notable sites == * Monte Cavo: The highest peak, historically known as Mons Albanus, was a key site for the worship of Jupiter. * Lake Albano: A volcanic crater lake that has been a popular destination for Romans and modern tourists alike. * Lake Nemi: Known for its scenic beauty, it was once a sacred lake dedicated to the goddess Diana. * Villa of Domitian: Remains of the villa built by Emperor Domitian near the modern town of Castel Gandolfo, now the site of the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo. == Modern significance == Today, the Alban Hills are a popular tourist destination, known for their natural beauty, historic towns, and cultural heritage. The area includes several charming hill towns such as Castel Gandolfo, which serves as the summer residence of the Pope, Frascati, and Nemi. The region is also famous for its vineyards and winemaking traditions, especially the production of Frascati wine. == Related pages == * Latium * Alba Longa * Castelli Romani * Roman mythology == References == Category:Mountains of Italy Category:Lazio",
