 "text": "Impressment (the Press) was the act of forcing men to serve in the navy. The people who were \"pressed\" to join the navy were usually young men. A naval officer would lead a press gang and force men onto warships where they were made to serve as sailors. Their families (if they had families) seldom knew where they had been taken. This was a normal practice in the Royal Navy during the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. Many people said that it should be stopped, but the Navy said it was a good way to get sailors who were needed to defend their country. After the Napoleonic Wars the need for sailors was less and the Navy stopped impressing them. ==Other websites== * The Impress Service, basic article on \"press gangs\" in British ports, charged with impressing sailors into the Navy.
