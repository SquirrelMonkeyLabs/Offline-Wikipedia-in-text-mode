During the American Revolutionary War Harris, a teenager with the rank of private, served with Georgia Governor John Clark. He fought in the impressive American victory during the Siege of Augusta.Elrod, Frary. \"Historical Notes on Jackson County, Georgia.\" Frary Elrod, 1967. He was engaged in the lumbering business in the St. Marys River (Florida-Georgia) area.\"Georgia Archives, University System of Georgia.\" http://vault.georgiaarchives.org/cdm/search/searchterm/buckner%20harris/order/title Harris was known to cross the international border from the U.S. state of Georgia into Spanish East Florida and illegally cut and harvest yellow pine and live oak timber. These actions infuriated the Spanish government, East Florida settlers and land owners which increased the tensions along the Georgia/Florida border and with the relationship between the two nations.Patrick, Rembert W. \"Florida Fiasco: Rampant Rebels on the Georgia- Florida Border, 1810–1815.” Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1954.Cusick, James G. \"The Other War of 1812: The Patriot War and the American Invasion of Spanish East Florida.\" Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2003. The Spanish were successfully routed by the American militia ambush. There were six Spanish fatalities and twelve injuries reported. According to Buckner F. Harris's report, at least 20 Spanish were killed or injured by his militia. The Patriot War and the Republic of Florida came to an end when Harris, the ebullient leader of the 'Patriot' movement, passed away and the US government refused to back them. == References == Category:1761 births Category:1814 deaths Category:Military people from Georgia (U.S. state)",
