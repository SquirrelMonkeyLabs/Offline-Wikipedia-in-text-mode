 "text": "Anderson's bubble-nest frog, Anderson's bush frog, tublercled small tree frog, or tuberculate shrub frog (Raorchestes andersoni) is a frog. It lives in Bangladesh, Tibet, northeastern India, Bhutan, and China's Yunnan Province. Scientists think it may live in Myanmar too. People have seen it between 0 and 2006 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees near the edges or forests and in wetlands. It lays eggs in bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. The tadpoles swim in the water. Scientists do not know if this frog can live in places that human beings have changed. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Scientists believe people cutting down its forests may put this frog in danger. One of the places the frog lives is a protected park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
