 "text": "Anomaloglossus tepequem is a frog. Scientists found it in Brazil. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives in forests. Scientists saw the frog high on the tepui flatlands, between 500 and 1100 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists think these frogs have young in the same way as other frogs in Anomaloglossus: The female lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground, and the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out, and they might all be dead now. In 1990, there were many frogs, but now scientists think that there are no more than fifty adult frogs alive at any one time. People dug for gold in the frog's home. To do this, they cut down the forests where the frog lived and put chemicals into the water. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also have killed these frogs, but they have not caught any frogs with the fungus on them yet. People do not dig for gold in the frog's home so much any more, but visitors to the frog's home, and places for animals to eat grass can also cause problems. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
