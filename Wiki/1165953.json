 "text": "In linguistics, a qualifier is a word, phrase, or grammatical construction that alters or limits the meaning of another word, usually an adjective or noun. A qualifier serves to make a statement more specific by narrowing the scope of its subject. For example, in the phrase \"very tall,\" the word \"very\" is a qualifier that intensifies the adjective \"tall.\" Examples of qualifiers: * \"A somewhat difficult task\" * \"A quite interesting book\" * \"He is extremely talented\" Category:Linguistics",
