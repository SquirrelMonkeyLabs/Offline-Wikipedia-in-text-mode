 "text": "Totalitär is a Swedish hardcore punk band formed in 1984-1985 in Hudiksvall. The band plays in the style of D-beat and hardcore punk. The first members were Poffen, Lanchy, Andreas and Lennart. Their drummer, Spennart joined the band in 1985, but quit during the summer of 1986. The band shared members between many local bands in Hudiksvall. Jörgen and Jesper from the two-piece band TGU were in the band between 1987 and 1989, before leaving to make the punk band The Kristet Utseende. The band went on a hiatus in 1990. In 1994, Finn Records asked them to reform the band, which made the band make Sin Egen Motståndare, their first full-length album. The band made studio material and rarely played live until 2000, where the band broke up. The band also had a fanzine called Antisystem, which was the band's old name. In 2006, they made an album called Vi Är Eliten. == Members == * Per-Olof \"Poffen\" Frimodog - vocals * Andreas Lönnquist - bass * Lars-Ander \"Lanchy\" Orre - guitar * Jallo Lehto - drums === Past === * Jörgen Fahlberg - guitar * Jesper Forselius - drums * Lennart E. - drums == Discography == === Albums === * 1994: Sin egen motståndare * 1997: Ni måste bort! * 2007: Vi är eliten ==== Compilations ==== * 2004: Wallbreaker 1986-1989 * 2020: Heydays Revisited * 2021: 1998-2002 ==== EPs ==== * 1986: Snabb livsglädje (demo) * 1987: Multinationella mördare * 1987: Luftslott * 1989: Vänd dig inte om * 1991: Snabb livsglädje * 1998: Klass inte ras * 1998: Vansinnets historia * 1999: Dom lurar oss * 2002: Allting är på låtsas * 2002: Spela bort allt du har * 2006: Vi är eliten ==== Split albums ==== * 1993: split cassette album with G-ANX - Descarga escandinava * 1995: split LP with Dismachine * 1999: split EP with Autoritär * 2001: split LP with Disclose * 2002: split EP/MCD with Dropdead * 2003: split EP with Tragedy == References == Category:1980s Swedish music groups Category:Swedish rock music groups",
