 "text": "The WAGR A class were a class of 13 steam locomotives designed by Beyer, Peacock & Coy of Manchester, England for the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR), who operated them from 1880 to 1955. The A class were 2-6-0+T \"mogul\" type tender locomotives initially used on the Eastern railway from Fremantle to Guildford on mainline passenger duties, though over the years they became relegated to lighter goods work and shunting. All but one of the 13 total A class were built by Beyer, Peacock & Coy; the sole outlier being built by DÃ¼bs & Coy. The first A class was imported to Western Australia by contractor John Robb for use in constructing the first section of the Eastern Railway in 1880. Two of the A class survive in preservation today, No. 11 is on display at Bassendean Railway Museum under the care of Rail Heritage W.A., and the other No. 15 is under restoration in Victoria.
