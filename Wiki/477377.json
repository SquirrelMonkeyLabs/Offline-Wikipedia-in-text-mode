 "text": "The Streisand effect is a name for a phenomenon. It is when an attempt to remove or censor a piece of information accidentally makes it more popular. The effect is named after American singer Barbra Streisand. In 2003, Streisand's lawyer tried to remove a photo of her house from a collection of thousands of photos of Malibu, California. However, the attempt to remove the photograph made it more interesting and share-able to media reporters. The same effect has occurred when countries, organizations, and people try to hide something. == Related pages == * Perverse incentive (\"Cobra effect\") * List of Streisand effect examples == References == Category:Internet culture",
