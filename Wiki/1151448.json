 "text": "The Lost Spider Pit Sequence is a lost movie from the King Kong franchise. == Plot == While trying to flee a rampaging Brontosaurus, the sailors of the Venture run through the jungle, and lose one of their men who tried to escape the beast by climbing a tree. He was menaced and eaten by the creature while the rest of the party escaped into the path of a Styracosaurus. It gave chase, and ate a slow crewman just as Carl Denham got his shirtsleeve caught in a bush. Meanwhile, Kong crossed a fallen log bridging a great chasm before resting Ann Darrow in a tree to stake out the cause of the commotion. As the sailors came to the bridge, Kong arrived as Jack Driscoll escaped by sheltering in a cave in the cliff face. The sailors tried to flee Kong, only to find the styracosaur blocking their path from the other end. With Jack watching in horror, Kong begins to shake the log, sending the sailors plummeting into the pit below before throwing the entire log in after them. At the pit's bottom, the surviving sailors are attacked by a giant quadrupedal Erythrosuchus, and they try to take refuge on top of the rock, where they are assaulted by the creature and a strange crab-like being. They try to defend themselves, as another sailor is rounded on by a huge spider, which prepares to devour him as a Sphenacodon scales the rock wall behind him. The last surviving member of the party backs into the shadows, where he is attacked by the horrifying octopus-insect. He tries to fight back with a knife, but is quickly overwhelmed. Up top, Kong realizes where Jack is hiding, and reaches his hand in to try and grab him. Jack stabs his hand, and this continues for a moment until the hissing sphenacodont climbs closer to Jack on a vine. Jack quickly cuts the vine and sends the monster tumbling back down as Kong reaches back in to restart his search for the man. ==References== Category:King Kong Category:Horror movies by year Category:Movies about apes Category:Short movies Category:Movies about reptiles Category:Movies about dinosaurs",
