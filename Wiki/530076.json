Then he was elected President in 1951 and served until 1954. Vargas led Brazil for 18 years, the longest of any President. He was second in Brazilian history only to Emperor Pedro II among heads of state. He favored nationalism, industrialization, centralization, social welfare and populism. Vargas won the nickname \"The Father of the Poor\". He was a supporter of workers rights and was very much an anti-communist. He committed suicide by shooting himself with a gun, after he was forced by the Brazilian military to resign from the Presidency. In 2014, sixty years after his death, the movie Getúlio which depicts the events that ended with his suicide, was made. == References == Category:1882 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Brazilian lawyers Category:Politicians who committed suicide Category:Presidents of Brazil Category:Former dictators Category:Anti-communists Category:Suicides by firearm Category:World War II political leaders Category:Politicians from Rio Grande do Sul",
