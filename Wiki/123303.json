 "text": "A supercentenarian is someone who has lived to the age of 110 years or more, something achieved by only one in a thousand centenarians. A very small number of supercentenarians have lived to be 115. Early uses of the word meant a person well over 100, but now it is just known as people who are 110 or older. * Jeanne Calment (1875–1997) had the world's longest verified human lifespan at 122 years, 164 days. * Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013) is the longest lived verified man at 116 years, 54 days. == Related pages == * Oldest people == References == == Other websites == * Gerontology Research Group * Supercentenarian Research Foundation * International Database on Longevity",
