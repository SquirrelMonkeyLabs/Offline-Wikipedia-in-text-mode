 "text": "Christ lag in Todes Banden (\"Christ lay in death's bonds\"), BWV 4, is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. It is one of Bach's earliest cantatas. It was written for Easter Sunday. The cantata is based on the hymn \"Christ lag in Todesbanden\" by Martin Luther. == History == The cantata may have been written in 1707. At the time, Bach was working in MÃ¼hlhausen. Bach performed the cantata again in Leipzig. He changed parts of the cantata. However, the changes were not big. == Music == The cantata is written for SATB choir, a cornetto, three trombones, two violins, a viola, and basso continuo. The cornetto and trombones play in unison with the choir. The cantata has eight movements: # Sinfonia # Versus 1: # Versus 2: # Versus 3: # Versus 4: # Versus 5: # Versus 6: # Versus 7: Every movement has the melody of the hymn tune. Unlike many of Bach's other cantatas, BWV 4 does not have any recitatives. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Church cantatas by Johann Sebastian Bach",
