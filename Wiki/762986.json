 "text": "A hatchback is a car body style with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to a cargo area. Indeed, this rear door that opens upwards is a distinguishing feature of all hatchbacks. Most hatchbacks use a two-box design body style, where the cargo area (trunk/boot) and passenger areas are a single unit. The rear seats can often be folded down to increase the available cargo area. The body style has been marketed worldwide on cars ranging in size from superminis to small family cars, as well as executive cars and some sports cars. It is useful for short journeys and for a medium amount of luggage (like in SUVs, minivans, station wagons, and some vans). == Styles == Usually, hatchback cars will have a hatch that is vertical or nearly vertical. The hatch swings open completely and gives easy access to storage. This is considered a traditional hatchback style, like is seen on vehicles such as the Ford Explorer or Saturn Vue. Sometimes, hatchback cars can come as \"fastbacks\", which is a form of hatchback in which the hatch slopes from the roof of the car down to the tail end. This can be seen on vehicles like the Chevrolet Corvette (certain generations/configurations) and Pontiac Solstice coupe (hardtop version only). Some hatchbacks are primarily made of glass, while others can be made almost entirely of the car's body material. Composition will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Generally, fastback styling is used on \"sportier\" vehicles to create more aggressive, aerodynamic designs. Conversely, the vertical hatchback has been more associated with economical, less performance-oriented vehicles. == References == Category:Automobile body styles",
