 "text": "Thales's theorem is a theorem (rule) in geometry. It says that if three points, P, Q, and R are on a circle where PR is a diameter (a straight line from one end of the circle to another, through the middle), the angle PQR is a right angle of 90 degrees. This is a special case of the inscribed angle theorem. Category:Theorems in geometry Category:Angles",
