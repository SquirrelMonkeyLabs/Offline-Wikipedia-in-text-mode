 "text": "Kindergarten, literally meaning \"children's garden\", is the first stage in the move from home to formal education. Children learn through play. In most countries kindergarten is part of the pre-school system. In North America and some parts of Australia kindergarten is the first year of school. Kindergarten children are usually between four and six years of age. Kindergarten ages vary from country to country. In Malaysia, for example, kindergarten children are six and when they are seven years old they go to primary school. While in the United States, to start kindergarten students must turn five before September 1st. Kindergarten for students in the U.S. has significantly moved away from children learning through play. Children are held to a high standard and are now expected to know the letters of the alphabet and their sounds. By the end of the year, students are expected to know how to read CVC, CCVC, and CVCC words. Play time in the U.S. for students in Kindergarten has become limited to around thirty minutes a day while all other times are devoted to learning. Learn how you can help your child prepare for Kindergarten The name kindergarten was coined by Friedrich Fröbel (1782–1852). His work influenced early-years education around the world. == Pre-Kindergarten == Sometimes, children go to pre-kindergarten for a year, before they go to kindergarten. Pre-kindergarten is more common in United States, Canada, and Turkey than other countries. It normally begins at four years old. Pre-Kindergartens are becoming more popular in the United States. School systems now host Pre-K classes for students who turn 4 before September 1st. Pre-Kindergarten is similar to what Kindergarten use to look like, students learn through play and social interactions. These programs are working to help prepare students for Kindergarten.
