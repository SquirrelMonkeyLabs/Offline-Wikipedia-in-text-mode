 "text": "\"Realest\" is a song by Filipino-American rapper Ez Mil and American rapper Eminem. The song was released on August 4, 2023. The song was the first single on the deluxe version of EZ Mil's third studio album DU4LI7Y. It is the first single by EZ Mil after signing with Shady, Aftermath, and Interscope. The song was able to make it to #3 on the New Zealand Hot Singles, #25 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 and #95 on the Canadian Hot 100 charts. In the song, EZ raps about how he is real and aims at the people who are jealous of his success and signing. During Eminem's verse, he responds to people who have dissed him in the past and criticized him because he is white. Eminem disses The Game (who said they don't play Eminem's songs in nightclubs), Lord Jamar (who said he was a guest in hip hop), Melle Mel (calling Mel a \"juicehead\" (steroid user)), and Generation Z (saying they should stick to shooting up schools). Melle Mel released a response but it was very disliked. Mel later took his diss track down and apologized to Eminem. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2023 songs Category:Eminem songs Category:Diss tracks Category:Hip hop songs",
