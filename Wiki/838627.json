 "text": "Riley Ann Sawyers (March 11, 2005 â€“ July 24, 2007) was a 2-year-old American girl who was beaten to death by her mother Kimberly Dawn Trenor and stepfather Royce Zeigler in a filicide. Her body was later found in Galveston Bay, Texas. Police were not able to identify the body when they saw it. They began a nationwide effort to learn the child's name. When Riley Ann's grandmother, Sheryl Sawyers, saw a drawing (composite sketch) made of the body, she knew that it was Riley Ann. She then told the police. After DNA testing on November 30, 2007, experts were certain that it was Riley Ann. Before she was identified in 2007, Riley Ann Sawyers was known as Baby Grace because of her age and sex. == References == == Further reading == * * * * == Other websites == * (1.94 MiB) * Category:2007 crimes Sawyers, Riley Ann Sawyers, Riley Ann Sawyers, Riley Ann",
