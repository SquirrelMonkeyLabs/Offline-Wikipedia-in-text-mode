This was the subject of Moler's thesis. Haigh, Thomas (January 2008). \"Cleve Moler: Mathematical Software Pioneer and Creator of MATLAB\". IEEE Annals of the History of Computing. 30 (1): 87–91. ==Who is Cleve Moler?== Cleve Moler is a famous mathematician. He is known for his scientific textbooksMoler, C. B. (2011). Experiments with MATLAB. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.Moler, C. B. (2004). Numerical computing with MATLAB. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. and technical reviews.Gupta, M. M. (1991). Numerical methods and software (David Kahaner, Cleve Moler, and Stephen Nash).

Nineteen dubious ways to compute the exponential of a matrix, twenty-five years later. SIAM review, 45(1), 3-49. ==Notable products== MathWorks is known for making powerful software used in many scientific and technical fields. ===MATLAB=== MATLAB is a programming language made for numerical analysis (especially numerical linear algebra).Gilat, Amos (2004). MATLAB: An Introduction with Applications 2nd Edition. John Wiley & Sons.Quarteroni, Alfio; Saleri, Fausto (2006). Scientific Computing with MATLAB and Octave. Springer.Gander, W., & Hrebicek, J. (Eds.). (2011). Solving problems in scientific computing using Maple and Matlab®. Springer Science & Business Media. It is named after Matrix Laboratory. ===Simulation software=== MathWorks is also known for their simulation-related products. The most famous one is Simulink.Binh, L. N. (2014). Optical fiber communication systems with Matlab and Simulink models. CRC Press.Stewart, R. W., Barlee, K. W., & Atkinson, D. S. (2015). Software defined radio using MATLAB & Simulink and the RTL-SDR.
