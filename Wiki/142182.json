In 1998, Gotti was diagnosed with throat cancer and sent to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, for surgery. Though the tumor was removed, the cancer returned two years later and Gotti was transferred back to Springfield. He died on June 10, 2002, at the age of 61. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Criminals from New York City Category:Gambino crime family Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People who died in prison custody in the United States Category:Deaths from throat cancer",
