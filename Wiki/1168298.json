The group has seven members: JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Handong, Yoohyeon, Dami, and Gahyun (who was earlier called Gahyeon). They officially debuted on January 13, 2017, with their single album Nightmare. Before becoming Dreamcatcher, the group was called MINX and had five members: JiU, SuA, Siyeon, Yoohyeon, and Dami. In November 2016, they announced they would re-debut in 2017 with a new name, Dreamcatcher, and two new members, Handong and Gahyun. They also changed their style to a darker concept and a unique music style, different from most K-pop girl groups. Dreamcatcher is often called \"The Face of Rock in K-pop\" because their music mixes rock and metal sounds. They are more popular internationally than in South Korea and are known for touring often in other countries.",
