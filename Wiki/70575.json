 "text": "The Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team was a professional bicycle racing team. The US Postal Service stopped was the sponsor of the team until 2004. The Discovery Channel took over sponsorship in June 2004 in time for the new UCI ProTour On February 10 2007 Discovery Channel ended its sponsorship of the team at the end of the 2007 season. The decision to end its sponsorship is believed to be related to the firing of Discovery Networks president Billy Campbell by David Zaslav, Zaslav became the new president of Discovery Communications that same day. On 10 August 2007, the team's licence holders, Tailwind Sports, said that the team would stop racing at the end of the year. They could not find a new sponsor and blamed that on bad publicity about doping in the 2007 Tour de France. ==Members== The most well known member of the Discovery Channel team was Lance Armstrong.
