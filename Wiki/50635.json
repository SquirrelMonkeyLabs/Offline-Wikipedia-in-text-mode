 "text": "William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (15 November 1708 â€“ 11 May 1778) was a prime minister of Great Britain. He was appointed by King George III. His London house, in St. James's Square, is now the home of the international affairs think tank called Chatham House. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, he came up with the strategy of blocking the St. Lawrence River so the French troops in Quebec and Montreal could not get more supplies. This weakened the French side, and helped to win the war.Black, Jeremy. Pitt the Elder. Cambridge University Press, 1992. His son, William Pitt the Younger, was also a prime minister. == References == Category:1708 births Category:1778 deaths Category:English Earls Category:Members of the British House of Commons for English constituencies Category:People buried in Westminster Abbey Category:People from Westminster Category:Politicians from London Category:Whig party (UK) politicians Category:Prime Ministers of Great Britain",
