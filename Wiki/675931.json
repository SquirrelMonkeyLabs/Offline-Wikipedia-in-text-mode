 "text": "Unbiunium is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka-actinium. Its atomic number should be 121 and it has the symbol Ubu. The name Unbiunium and the symbol Ubu are temporary IUPAC names (meaning \"one-two-one\" in Latin). This name and symbol exist until a permanent name is decided and the element is created. It is expected to be a F-block element and in a group call the superactinides. It is the third element in the eighth period of the periodic table. == Creation attempts == The synthesis of unbiunium was first attempted in 1977 by bombarding a target of uranium-238 with copper-65 ions at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany: * 238U + 65Cu â†’ 303Ubu No atoms were identified. Another alternative name is \"Lavoisium\". ==References== Category:Hypothetical chemical elements Category:Superactinides",
