 "text": "The Christian Reformed Church (CRC) includes just over one thousand congregations across the United States and Canada. About 75 percent of the churches are in the United States; 25 percent are in Canada. It is one of only a few binational denominations: rather than split into different churches at the 49th parallel, it is united. Almost 300,000 people belong to the CRCNAâ€”not a large number when you consider the population of the two countries. ==References== Category:Calvinism Category:Religious organizations based in Canada Category:Christian organizations based in the United States",
