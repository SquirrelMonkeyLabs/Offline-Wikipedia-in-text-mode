 "text": "Space Shuttle Challenger (OV-099) was the second space shuttle used by NASA to fly into outer space. The shuttle broke up 73 seconds after take-off from Cape Canaveral on 28 January 1986. All seven astronauts who were on it at the time were killed. The crash happened because a rubber tube called an o-ring did not expand to fill a gap in one of the booster rockets, due to cold weather. The Challenger was named after a Royal Navy ship that explored the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans from 1872 to 1876. Challenger was also the name of the Apollo 17 Lunar Excursion Module. == Crew == * Francis \"Dick\" Scobee (46) * Michael John Smith (40) * Judith Resnik (36) * Ellison Onizuka (39) * Ronald McNair (35) * Gregory Jarvis (41) * Christa McAuliffe (37), first teacher in space ==Missions== # Date Designation Launch pad Landing location Notes 1 04.April.1983 STS-6 39-A Edwards Air Force Base First Shuttle Space Walk 2 .18.June.1983 STS-7 39-A Edwards Air Force Base First U.S. Woman in Space 3 30.
