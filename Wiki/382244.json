It was created by Intel for netbooks, smartphones, tablet computers, and embedded systems. It was created to compete with the ARM CPU. Its performance per watt is still not as good as the ARM, although the overall performance is better. For a given clock speed, the performance is about the same as a Pentium 4, but the power consumption is much lower. Category:Intel processors",
