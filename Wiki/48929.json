 "text": "Panentheism (lit. 'all in God'), similar to Pantheism, is the belief that the the creation are part of God. It is different to Pantheism in that God is also believed to be greater than the creation. The term is believed to be created by Karl Krause in 1828 (after studying Hindu scripture) to distinguish the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) about the relation of God and the universe from the supposed pantheism of Baruch Spinoza. Many people may find this belief to be confusing, this may explain why Panentheism itself is an ancient esoteric (secretive) belief. Panentheism is believed to be found in all major religious traditions including but not exclusive to Hinduism, the Jewish Kabbalah, Christian Mysticism, Sufism and Sikhism. This belief being found in completely different world traditions has inspired the Traditional Perennial Philosophy. == Related page == *Pantheism Category:Theology",
