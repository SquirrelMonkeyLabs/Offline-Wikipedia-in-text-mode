 "text": "The Naval Academy Mürwik (German: Marineschule Mürwik) is the training school for German Navy officers in Flensburg-Mürwik. The castle-like building overlooks the Flensburg Fjord. Called the \"Red Castle\", it is well known for its beautiful architecture. It was patterned after the Marienburg (Malbork Castle) in Poland, the seat of the Teutonic Knights. == History == The academy was opened 1 October 1910. At the start of World War I in August 1914, the academy was temporarily closed. The Germans thought the war would be short. It reopened in January 1915. Cadets would spend three months training then go to sea to train aboard cruisers. At the end of World War II, after Adolf Hitler committed suicide, Admiral Karl Dönitz set up the last Nazi government at Flensburg-Mürwik academy.Philip D. Grove; Mark J. Grove; et al., World War II: The War at Sea (New York: Rosen Publishing, 2010), p. 87 A few days later Germany surrendered. Currently cadets spend a year at Flensburg-Mürwik academy before going on to study at the Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr in Hamburg or the Bundeswehr University Munich.Germany: A Country Study, ed.
