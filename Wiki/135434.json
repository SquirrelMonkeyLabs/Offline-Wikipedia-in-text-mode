Petrarch is often called the \"father of humanism\".There are many popular examples, for a recent one this review of Carol Quillen's Rereading the Renaissance Based on Petrarch's works, and to a lesser extent those of Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio, Pietro Bembo in the 16th century created the model for the modern Italian language. Petrarch is credited with developing the sonnet with his Canzoniere to a level of perfection that would be unsurpassed to this day and spreading its use to other European languages. His sonnets were admired and imitated throughout Europe during the Renaissance and became a model for lyrical poetry. Petrarch was also known for being one of the first people to call the Middle Ages the Dark Ages, although the negative myth as we know it today is largely the legacy of romantic literature. == References == == Other websites == * Canzoniere (different edition) and other works * Petrarch and Laura Multi-lingual site including many translated works (letters, poems, books) in the public domain and biography, pictures, music. * Petrarch from the Catholic Encyclopedia. * Excerpts from his works and letters * The Petrarchan Grotto * Francesco Petrarca (Petrarch) (1304-1374) * * Poems From The Canzoniere, translated by Tony Kline. * Petrarch - the poet who lost his head April 6, 2004 article in The Guardian regarding the exhumation of Petrarch's remains. * Francesco Petrarca at The Online Library of Liberty * De remediis utriusque fortunae, Cremonae, B. de Misintis ac Caesaris Parmensis, 1492.
