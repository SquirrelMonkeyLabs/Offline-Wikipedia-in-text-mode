 "text": "Dendrology is the science of trees and other woody plants (plants that make wood) such as shrubs or lianas. The word \"dendrology\" comes from Greek words δένδρον meaning \"tree\" and λόγος meaning \"study\". Botany and dendrology are not very different, since woody plants come from many different plant families. Those families can also have species that are not woody. Dendrology usually focuses on identifying woody plants that are bought and sold. It also focuses on how all the woody plants taxonomically relate to each other. Dendrologists study species that are native in the area, and species that are not native in the area. Dendrology used to include the natural history of woody species in specific areas, but that is now under ecology. Dendrologists also help to conserve woody plants that are endangered. == References == Category:Trees Category:Branches of botany",
