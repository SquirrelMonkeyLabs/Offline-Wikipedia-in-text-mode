In it, the Kenya Defence Forces were sent into southern Somalia in 2011-2012.Williams, Paul D. “Joining AMISOM: Why Six African States Contributed Troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia.” Journal of Eastern African Studies 12, no. 1 (January 2, 2018): 172–92. They were sent to fight Al-Shabaab insurgents .The Kenyan government said that the operation was done in 2012. After this, its forces joined AMISOM in Somalia. Some people think that the Kenyan government wanted to make a buffer zone between Al- Shabaab in southern Somalia and Kenya. People also think that Kenya also probably wanted to be seen as a partner with the United States. ==Notes== ==References== == Further reading == * Williams, Paul, \"Fighting for Peace in Somalia: A History and Analysis of the African Union Mission (AMISOM)\", 2007–2017.
