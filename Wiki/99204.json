 "text": "Space Invaders is a video game made by the Taito Corporation. Space Invaders is one of the most famous early video games. The game is about defending the Earth from Space Invaders (aliens) by shooting them down before they can land. There have been seven versions of Space Invaders made by the Taito Corporation. Space Invaders was designed by the Taito Corporations man in charge of the game making department, Toshihiro Nishikado. Nishikado was inspired to make the game after watching Star Wars and War of the Worlds. At first Space Invaders was a coin-operated machine but has been made available for almost every games console and home computer. Before making Space Invaders, Nishikado worked on games called Soccer and Interceptor. He says the hardest part of making a video game is designing the computer inside it. Taito describes Space Invaders as \"an international phenomenon\". ==Space Invaders versions== *Space Invaders, 1978 *Space Invaders Part 2, 1979 *The Return of the Space Invaders, 1985 *Space Invaders '91, 1991 *Space Invaders DX, 1995 *Space Invaders '95, 1995 *Space Invaders 3D ==References== *Taito Legends, 2005 *Taito Legends 2, 2006 Category:Arcade games Category:Atari 5200 games Category:Fixed shooters Category:Game Boy games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Color games Category:IOS games Category:Midway video games Category:Mobile games Category:MSX games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:PlayStation games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:SG-1000 games Category:Single- player video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games about alien invasions Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Windows games Category:1970s video games",
