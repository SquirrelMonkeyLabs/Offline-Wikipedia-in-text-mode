 "text": "Design is the visual appearence or shape given to an object. Design aims to make things prettier, more comfortable, or better in some way by making them work well and look good. Good design decisions can make a space, for example, a hospital or an airport, more accessible or an image more attractive for advertisements, adding value in the market. Designers use knowledge and rules from geometry and art to create their designs. Design is sometimes divided to sub-categories, including graphic design, interior design, vehicle design, furniture design, product design, type design, fashion design and web design, to name a few. Design does not always lead to physical objects; it can involve applications, websites, prototypes, presentations, or serve as a plan for creating something else. Design is also a concept used to create an object (virtual or not). Design is picturing things using the imagination; as to using perception or memory. == Related pages == * Universal design Category:Human activities",
