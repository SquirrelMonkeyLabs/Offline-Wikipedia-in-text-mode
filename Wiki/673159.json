 "text": "Dean Arnold Corll (December 24, 1939 â€“ August 8, 1973) was an American serial killer. Along with David Owen Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley, Jr., he kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered at least 29 people. All of his victims were males aged 13 to 20. The killings took place between 1970 and 1973 in Houston, Texas. The crimes became known as the Houston Mass Murders. It came to light after Henley fatally shot Corll. Houston Mass Murders were considered the worst example of serial murder in American history. Corll was also known as the Candy Man and the Pied Piper. This was because he and his family had owned and operated a candy factory in Houston Heights. He had been known to give free candy to local children.Mass Murder in Houston, John K.Gurwell, p. 73 == References == Category:1939 births Category:1973 deaths Category:American murder victims Category:American rapists Category:American serial killers Category:Criminals from Indiana Category:Deaths by firearm in Texas Category:Gay men Category:LGBT people from Indiana Category:People from Fort Wayne, Indiana",
