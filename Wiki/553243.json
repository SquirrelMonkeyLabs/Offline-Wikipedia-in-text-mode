Zhao did not like Maoist policies. He received support from Deng Xiaoping after the Cultural Revolution. Zhao tried to stop corruption and to make general market economic changes. His views made him unpopular with important leaders including Premier Li Peng, former President Li Xiannian and Party elder Chen Yun. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Zhao was not allowed to be a politician. He was placed under house arrest. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:2005 deaths Category:General Secretaries of the Communist Party of China Category:Premiers of the People's Republic of China Category:20th-century Chinese politicians",
