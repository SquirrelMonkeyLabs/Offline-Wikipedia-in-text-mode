 "text": "The Na'vi language is a language that was made for the Na'vi in the 2009 film Avatar. It is a constructed language. This means a person created it; no one grows up speaking it. == History == The first Na'vi words were made by the professor Paul Frommer in 2005 for the film. When the movie was released in 2009, the vocabulary had increased to a thousand words. Initial understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator, however over time more and more people have learned the language thanks to the continual development of the language. To date, roughly 2656 words exist in the dictionary, with more added periodically thanks to Paul Frommer and active language learners. Websites like Kelutral.org or Learn Na'vi have learning materials and communities to learn with others. ==Related pages== * Avatar (2009 film) * Constructed language * Na'vi ==References== Category:Fictional languages",
