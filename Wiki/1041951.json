G-A 932/1112 (german) was an Austrian football player. ==Career== From 1939 to 1944 Jelinek played for Wiener Sport- Club as a striker. From 1940 to 1942 he played in the Gauliga Ostmark, in one of initially 16 Gauligas. In his debut season at senior level, he scored the most for his club as a 19-year-old with 17 goals. In the following season, his last for the Wiener Sport-Club, he was top scorer with 20 league goals together with Ernst Reitermaier. The performances he had shown up to that point – and also those of Ludwig Durek, who was a year older than him and played on the left wing – did not go unnoticed by Reich coach Sepp Herberger. Both made their debuts on 15 September 1940 in the senior national team, which won the friendly against the national team of Slovakia 1-0 in Bratislava thanks to Durek's goal scored in the 81st minute. Despite being invited to another course in March 1941, he did not make international appearances. Durek earned five more international appearances and scored another goal. Jelinek, drafted into service in the Wehrmacht, died as a soldier on 20 May 1944 after the Battle of Monte Cassino. ==Honours== Individual * Top scorer Gauliga Ostmark: 1942 ==References== Category:1922 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austrian football forwards Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga top scorers",
