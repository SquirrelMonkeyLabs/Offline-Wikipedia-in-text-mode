 "text": "Protonation is the addition of a hydrogen ion to a substance. A hydrogen atom normally contains 1 proton and 1 electron. When the hydrogen atom is oxidized, it loses its electron, leaving a H+. The H+ is the same as a proton. Substances are protonated when hydrogen ions are added to them. For example, when ammonia () is protonated, it forms ammonium ions, . According to the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, a substance that can be protonated is a base. After being protonated, it becomes the base's conjugate acid. ==Related pages== *Deprotonation *Proton *Hydrogen Category:Chemical reactions",
