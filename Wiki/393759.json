ESPN. 20 March 2007. \"Fiddling For Worms\". Accessed 7 June 2007.Phillips, John E. MotherEarthNews.com. 1 May 1980. \"Fiddling for fish bait\". Accessed 7 June 2007. Most worm charming methods involve vibrating the soil, which encourages the worms to the surface. One method involves twirling a steel pole in the ground, which moves the dirt, making the worms in the area go to the top of the ground. A lot of worm grunting is done in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Every year on June 21, thousands of fishermen show up for the annual worm grunting festival. The activity is usually performed to collect bait for fishing. ==References== Category:Sports involving animals Category:Fishing",
