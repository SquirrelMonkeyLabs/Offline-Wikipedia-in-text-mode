Elements from this game were adapted into the 2024 film Sonic the Hedgehog 3. ==Plot== ==Gameplay== ===Playable characters=== *Sonic the Hedgehog *Miles \"Tails\" Prower *Knuckles the Echidna *Shadow the Hedgehog *Dr. Eggman *Rouge the Bat *Amy Rose (multiplayer only) *Metal Sonic (multiplayer only) ===Playing style=== ====Sonic and Shadow==== The levels for Sonic and Shadow are the classic \"Get to the Goal\" levels. They are very agile and can use shortcuts made by enemies and later, Rings. They have the ability to become Super, using the Chaos Emeralds. The levels are very similar to the original Sonic the Hedgehog game, except three dimensional. ====Tails and Eggman==== These two are also \"Get to the Goal\" levels. A difference from Sonic and Shadow's levels are that they are \"mech\", in other words they use machines to move around. They fire bullets from their Cannons. ====Knuckles and Rouge==== These levels are treasure hunting levels, where they have to find Master Emerald shards, Chaos Emeralds (in Rouge's case), or Door Keys. ==Reception== ==References== Category:2001 video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog games Category:3D platformers Category:Dreamcast games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about impact events Category:Video games about terrorism",
