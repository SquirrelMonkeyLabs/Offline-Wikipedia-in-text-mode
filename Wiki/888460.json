 "text": "Ctenochasma (meaning \"comb jaw\") is a genus of Upper Jurassic pterosaur of the suborder Pterodactyloidea. Their fossilized remains have been found in the Solnhofen limestone of Bavaria,von Meyer C.E.H. 1852. Ctenochasma Roemeri. Paläontographica, 2: 82–84 & pl. 13. Germany, and a couple of other sites laid down in the late Jurassic period. The teeth were a filter-feeding apparatus: the pterosaurs strained out algae or small invertebrates from stagnant tropical waters, as flamingoes do today. This kind of life is mirrored by another pterosaur genus, Pterodaustro, which had an active pumping mechanism to push water through its teeth.Bennett S.C. 2007.
