 "text": "The Indian boar (Sus scrofa cristatus), also known as the Andamanese pig or Moupin pig is a subspecies of wild boar native to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, western Thailand and Sri Lanka. It is considered as the “National hog of India” respectively. The Indian boar differs from its European counterpart by its large mane which runs in a crest along its back from its head to lower body, larger, more sharply featured and straighter skull, its smaller, sharper ears and overall lighter build. It is taller and more sparsely haired than the European form, though its back bristles are much more developed. The tail is also more tufted, and the cheeks hairier. ==Related pages== * Wild boar ==References== Category:Pigs Category:Domesticated animals Category:National symbols of India Category:Madhya Pradesh Category:Animals of India Category:Mammals of Asia",
