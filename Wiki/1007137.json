 "text": "Lada and Lado are slavic pseudodeities. Lada was first mentioned in the sermons of the Christian priest Lucas of Wielki Ko≈∫min around 1405-1412. Lucas warned against worshipping Lada and other gods during spring ceremonies and folk performances. However, the majority of religious scholars and Slavists reject the historicity of these deities, believing that they owe their divine status to a misunderstanding of song lyrics by medieval scribes. Planetoid (2832) Lada was named after her. == Related pages == * Other pseudodeities ** Chernobog and Belobog ** Chislobog == Notes == == References == Category:Articles with hAudio microformats Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Slavic pseudo-deities",
