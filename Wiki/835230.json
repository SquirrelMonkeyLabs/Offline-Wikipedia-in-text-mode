It is the highest mountain in Myanmar. It has been protected as a national park since 1998. The mountain is in Kachin State, the northernmost state of Myanmar. Takashi Ozaki (Japan, 1951 – May 14, 2011) and Nyima Gyaltsen (aka \"Aung Tse\"; Myanmar) made the first ascent in 1996. As of 2021, they were the only people to have reached the top of the mountain and to have returned alive. Ozaki had attempted the mountain in 1995 but turned back due to bad weather.Frederique Gely-Ozaki, Hkakabo Razi, The Himalayan Journal, Volume 52, 1996 The route to basecamp is long (four weeks). A dense rain forest needs to be traversed, with many unbridged stream crossings. Before 1993, foreigners were not allowed travel to the area. This may be one of the reasons why the first successful climb was only done recently. In 2013, the nearby peak of Gamlang Razi was climbed and measured at using an advanced version of GPS, making it possibly the highest in Myanmar.Andy Tyson, Gamlang Razi.

Trevor Brown, Gamlang Razi – Setting the Elevation Straight A team was sent out, to measure the exact height, in 2014. They had to turn back at a height of . They estimated that the summit was higher. Therefore, its exact height is unknown. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Geography of Myanmar Category:Himalayas",
