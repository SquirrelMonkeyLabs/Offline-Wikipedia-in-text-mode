 "text": "NXT TakeOver was a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view and livestreaming shows by WWE produced for their NXT brand. Wrestlers who have not made it to one of WWE's two main weekly TV shows, Raw or SmackDown, wrestle on NXT. NXT TakeOver shows were the biggest shows for wrestlers on NXT. They aired live on the WWE Network, with later events airing on Peacock and traditional pay-per-view channels in the U.S. Some events took place on the weekends of WWE's big main roster shows like WrestleMania or SummerSlam. For the NXT UK brand, WWE held the NXT UK TakeOver series. When NXT was renamed to NXT 2.0 in September 2021, the TakeOver name was no longer used, starting with NXT WarGames that November. The last TakeOver event was NXT TakeOver 36 on August 22. ==Events== No. Event Date Venue Location Main event Ref. 1 TakeOver Full Sail University Winter Park, Florida Adrian Neville (c) vs. Tyson Kidd for the NXT Championship 2 Fatal 4-Way Adrian Neville (c) vs. Sami Zayn vs. Tyler Breeze vs. Tyson Kidd for the NXT Championship 3 R Evolution Adrian Neville (c) vs. Sami Zayn in a Title vs. Career match for the NXT Championship 4 Rival Sami Zayn (c) vs. Kevin Owens for the NXT Championship 5 Unstoppable Kevin Owens (c) vs. Sami Zayn for the NXT Championship 6 Brooklyn Barclays Center Brooklyn, New York Finn Bálor (c) vs. Kevin Owens in a Ladder match for the NXT Championship 7 Respect Full Sail University Winter Park, Florida Bayley (c) vs. Sasha Banks in a 30-minute Iron Woman match for the NXT Women's Championship 8 London SSE Arena London, England Finn Bálor (c) vs. Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship . 9 Dallas Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center Dallas, Texas Finn Bálor (c) vs. Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship 10 The End Full Sail University Winter Park, Florida Samoa Joe (c) vs. Finn Bálor in a Steel Cage match for the NXT Championship 11 Brooklyn II Barclays Center Brooklyn, New York Samoa Joe (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the NXT Championship 12 Toronto Air Canada Centre Toronto, Ontario, Canada Shinsuke Nakamura (c) vs. Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship 13 San Antonio Freeman Coliseum San Antonio, Texas Shinsuke Nakamura (c) vs. Bobby Roode for the NXT Championship 14 Orlando Amway Center Orlando, Florida Bobby Roode (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the NXT Championship 15 Chicago Allstate Arena Rosemont, Illinois The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) (c) vs. DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa) in a Ladder match for the NXT Tag Team Championship 16 Brooklyn III Barclays Center Brooklyn, New York Bobby Roode (c) vs. Drew McIntyre for the NXT Championship 17 WarGames Toyota Center Houston, Texas SAnitY (Alexander Wolfe, Eric Young, and Killian Dain) vs. The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) and Roderick Strong vs. The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, and Kyle O'Reilly) in a WarGames match 18 Philadelphia Wells Fargo Center Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Andrade \"Cien\" Almas (c) vs. Johnny Gargano for the NXT Championship 19 New Orleans Smoothie King Center New Orleans, Louisiana Johnny Gargano vs. Tommaso Ciampa in an unsanctioned match 20 Chicago II Allstate Arena Rosemont, Illinois Johnny Gargano vs. Tommaso Ciampa in a Chicago Street Fight 21 Brooklyn 4 Barclays Center Brooklyn, New York Tommaso Ciampa (c) vs. Johnny Gargano in a Last Man Standing match for the NXT Championship 22 WarGames Staples Center Los Angeles, California Pete Dunne, Ricochet, and War Raiders (Hanson and Rowe) vs. The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, Kyle O'Reilly, and Roderick Strong) in a WarGames match 23 Phoenix Talking Stick Resort Arena Phoenix, Arizona Tommaso Ciampa (c) vs. Aleister Black for the NXT Championship 24 New York Barclays Center Brooklyn, New York Johnny Gargano vs. Adam Cole in a two- out-of-three falls match for the vacant NXT Championship 25 XXV Webster Bank Arena Bridgeport, Connecticut Johnny Gargano (c) vs. Adam Cole for the NXT Championship 26 Toronto Scotiabank Arena Toronto, Ontario, Canada Adam Cole (c) vs. Johnny Gargano in a two-out-of-three falls match for the NXT Championship 27 WarGames Allstate Arena Rosemont, Illinois Tommaso Ciampa, Keith Lee, Dominik Dijakovic, and Kevin Owens vs. The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Bobby Fish, Kyle O'Reilly, and Roderick Strong) in a WarGames match 28 Portland Moda Center Portland Adam Cole (c) vs. Tommaso Ciampa for the NXT Championship 29 In Your House June 7, 2020 Full Sail University Winter Park, Florida Charlotte Flair (c) vs. Rhea Ripley vs. Io Shirai for the NXT Women's Championship 30 XXX August 22, 2020 Keith Lee (c) vs. Karrion Kross for the NXT Championship 31 31 October 4, 2020 Capitol Wrestling Center at WWE Performance Center Orlando, Florida Finn Bálor (c) vs. Kyle O'Reilly for the NXT Championship 32 WarGames December 6, 2020 The Undisputed Era (Adam Cole, Kyle O'Reilly, Roderick Strong, and Bobby Fish) vs. Team McAfee (Pat McAfee, Pete Dunne, Danny Burch, and Oney Lorcan) in a WarGames match 33 Vengeance Day February 14, 2021 Finn Bálor (c) vs. Pete Dunne for the NXT Championship 34 Stand & Deliver April 7, 2021 Io Shirai (c) vs. Raquel González for the NXT Women's Championship April 8, 2021 Adam Cole vs. Kyle O'Reilly in an unsanctioned match 35 In Your House June 13, 2021 Karrion Kross (c) vs. Adam Cole vs. Kyle O'Reilly vs. Johnny Gargano vs. Pete Dunne for the NXT Championship 36 36 August 22, 2021 Karrion Kross (c) vs. Samoa Joe for the NXT Championship == References == Category:Professional wrestling Category:WWE Category:World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view events",
