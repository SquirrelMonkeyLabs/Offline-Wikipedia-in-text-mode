 "text": "The Blue Lagoon ( ) is a geothermal spa in southwestern Iceland. The spa is located in a lava field from Grindavík and in front of Mount Þorbjörn on the Reykjanes Peninsula, in a location favorable for geothermal power, and is supplied by water used in the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power station. The Blue Lagoon is approximately from Keflavík International Airport, and is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Iceland. The Blue Lagoon is man- made. The water is a byproduct from the nearby geothermal power station Svartsengi where heated water is transported from the ground near a lava flow and used to run steam turbines that produces electricity. After going through the turbines, the steam and hot water passes through pipes to provide heat for the settlements. Then the water is fed into the Blue Lagoon. The water temperature in the bathing and swimming area of the Blue Lagoon averages . The water's light blue color is due to its high silica content. The silica forms soft white mud on the bottom of the lake which bathers rub on themselves. The water is also rich in salts and algae. == References == == Other websites == * * Information from Reykjavik's tourist organization Category:20th-century establishments in Iceland Category:Southern Peninsula (Iceland)",
