 "text": "In medicine, a paradoxical reaction is when the body reacts to a substance in a way that is completely different to what is expected. These substances usually are drugs. Paradoxical reactions are different from reactions that occur because people get used to the effects of a drug, or those that occur when they suddenly stop taking a drug that they have taken for a long time. A paradoxical reaction might be hat someone who has taken a sleeping pill suddenly suffers from sleeplessness. Another example might be that people who have taken painklilers become very sensitive to pain. Category:Medicine",
