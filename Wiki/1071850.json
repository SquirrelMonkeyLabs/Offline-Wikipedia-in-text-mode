 "text": "Manchester Gorton is a Manchester Parliamentary constituency in the British House of Commons. It was set up in 1885. The boundaries have been changed over the years. Since 1935 it has always had a Labour MP. Gerald Kaufman was the MP from 1983 until his death in 2017. Since 2017 the Member of parliament is Afzal Khan. There are seven wards of the City of Manchester in the constituency: Fallowfield, Gorton North, Gorton South, Levenshulme, Longsight, Rusholme and Whalley Range wards. The Boundary Commission review in 2023 decided to abolish it. From the next General Election Gorton, Levenshulme and Longsight will be included with the town of Denton in a new constituency called Gorton and Denton. Fallowfield, Rusholme and Whalley Range will be part of the re-established constituency of Manchester Rusholme. ==References== Category:Westminster Parliamentary constituencies in England Category:Manchester",
