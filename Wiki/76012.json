(eds) 2005. Mammal species of the world. 3rd ed, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2 vols, pp. 90-91. During the period of the last ice age there were more species. They included a number of species of the elephant-like mammoths and mastodons. The oldest proboscidean dates from the early Palaeogene period, over 50 million years ago. The evolution of the elephant-like animals mainly concerned the proportions of the cranium and jaw and the shape of the tusks and molar teeth. These were adaptations to various kinds of vegetable. food == Families == Present-day elephants are the survivors of a once larger and more varied family. *Elephantidae *†Gomphotheriidae *†Mammutidae *†Stegodontidae *†Barytheriidae *†Deinotheriidae *†Moeritheriidae *†Numidotheriidae *†Palaeomastodontidae *†Phiomiidae ==References==",
