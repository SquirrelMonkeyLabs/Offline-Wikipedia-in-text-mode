 "text": "Blue Slide Park is the first studio album by American rapper Mac Miller. It was released on November 8, 2011, by Rostrum Records. In July 2011, the title was announced. The album was named after a section of Frick Park (which is known as Blue Slide Park) in Pittsburgh. The park section is at the corner of Beechwood Blvd and Nicholson Street. That is just two blocks from Taylor Allderdice High School where Miller attended. The album cover was designed by his older brother Miller McCormick and Redtape Design. ==Track listing== Notes * On some physical copies of the album a 17th song, \"Donald Trump\", is incorrectly listed as a bonus track on the reverse cover track listing. Miller confirmed via his official Twitter page that this was due to a factory error and that the album would contain 16 new songs. == References == Category:2011 albums Category:Hip hop albums",
