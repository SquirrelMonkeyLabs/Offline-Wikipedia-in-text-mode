 "text": "The WAGR Y class were a total of 18 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways from 1953 to 1990. The Y class were built by British Thomson-Houston (BTH) of Rugby, England in conjunction with the Clayton Equipment Coy (CEL) of Derbyshire, England who assembled and tested the locos before shipment at Hatton with separate builder's plates displayed for each business on every loco. Mostly the Y class were used for shunting duties at Perth and Fremantle, but some did haul goods trains on the Northern Railway around Geraldton and Pinjarra on the Hotham Valley Railway. In total 7 Y class have been preserved, with one at the South West Rail & Heritage Centre, Boyanup and the Bassendean Railway Museum. Another is stored at Boulder Railway Station in Kalgoorlie with 4 also displayed/stored after operating timber services at Pemberton, though their current disposition is unknown.
