The battle broke the spirit of the Russian Army which never again fielded an army against the British and French allies. It was followed by the Siege of Sevastopol. == Lead up to the battle == The allied armies of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire had landed on the west coast of Crimea on September 14, 1854. They meant to capture the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. They defeated the Russian army in the Battle of Alma. The allies could have attacked Sevastopol, but the British general and the French commander could not agree on a plan of attack. Instead, they decided to march around the city and put Sevastopol under siege. Towards the end the allies marched to the southern coast of the Crimean and set up a supply port in the city of Balaklava. Before the siege the Russian commander retreated out of Sevastopol. On 25 October 1854, a Russian force attacked the British base at Balaklava. The attack failed before they could reach it, but the Russian had a stronghold on the British line. == References == Category:1854 in Europe Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles involving Russia Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom Category:Crimean war",
