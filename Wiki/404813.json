 "text": "The Illinois Governor's Mansion, formerly called the Illinois Executive Mansion, is the official residence of the Governor of Illinois. It is at 410 E. Jackson Street in Springfield, Illinois and is open to tours on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings, free of charge. The Georgian style Mansion was designed by Chicago architect John M. Van Osdel. The Mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The 16-room manor was completed in 1855 and was first occupied by governor Joel Aldrich Matteson, who held the official grand opening on January 10, 1856. It is the oldest historic residence in the state of Illinois and one of the three oldest continuously- occupied governor's mansions in the United States. In 2011, a multimillion dollar renovation was planned because the last repairs to the mansion were in 1971. ==References== ==Other websites== *Illinois Executive Mansion Official Site *Information about tours and photos Category:Buildings and structures in Springfield, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places Category:Houses in the United States Category:1855 establishments in Illinois Illinois",
