 "text": "The Iberian Romance, or Ibero-Romance, languages are a branch of Romance languages. They were first spoken in Iberia. There are two branches of Iberian Romance languages, Occitano-Romance and West Iberian. The main two languages in the branch are Spanish (Castilian) and Portuguese. They came from a dialect of Vulgar Latin spoken in Iberia after the Roman Empire ended. Spanish and Portuguese spread to Latin America during the colonial era. ==References== Category:Romance languages",
