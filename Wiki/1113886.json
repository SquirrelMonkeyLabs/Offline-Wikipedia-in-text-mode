 "text": "Equatorial Guinea has a big problem with political corruption. There is a lot of political corruption in Equatorial Guinea. It is one of the most corrupt countries on earth. It has been described as \"an almost perfect kleptocracy\" in which the scale of systemic corruption and the rulers' indifference towards the people's welfare place it at the bottom of every major governance indicator or ranking, below nations with similar per capita GDPs. \"Few countries symbolize oil-fuelled corruption and nepotism more than Equatorial Guinea\", wrote Jan Mouawad in The New York Times in July 2009. Its corruption system, according to the Open Society Foundations (OSF), is \"unparalleled in its brazenness\". A small number of powertful people control this government. They divert most of the country's revenues into their own clandestine bank accounts in other countries. Equatorial Guinea's corruption is so entrenched, scholar Geoffrey Wood has claimed, that it can be classified as a criminal state. This situation is especially dramatic due to the massive scale of the country's revenues from oil and other natural resources. The Guardian noted that the nation is enormously wealthy because of vast oil reserves, but that that wealth is concentrated in the hands of an elite minority. Despite its GDP per capita of $18,236 – which makes it richer than most African countries and places it below China – Equatorial Guinea is ranked 145th out of 189 countries in the Human Development Index measure of quality of life. While the people of Equatorial Guinea technically have a per capita GDP similar to China, the vast majority live in poverty worse than Afghanistan or Chad, according to Arvind Ganesan of Human Rights Watch in 2009, attributing this disparity to the government's corruption, incompetence, and disregard of its own people's well- being. Most people in Equatorial Guinea remain in poverty, with no access to healthcare or education. The government uses force and intimidation to silence opposition. For this reason, there is no criticism of the ruling class. Sasha Lezhnev of Global Witness noted in 2008 that the government earns oil revenues in the billions yearly, while the population lives on less than $1 a day. President Teodoro Obiang is said to have control over the oil reserves and the government. Ganesan claimed that the country's immensely rich treasury is \"a private cash machine for a few\" rather than used for any public benefit. According to the Financial Times, foreign diplomats joke that Equatorial Guinea is a family-run business which holds a seat at the UN. The nation is known among foreign businessmen as a poor environment for business and investments. The individual who has become most associated in the international media with the corruption of Equatorial Guinea's leaders is Teodorin Obiang, a son of the president. His lavish lifestyle in southern California, Paris, and elsewhere has made headlines and been the target of investigations by American and French authorities, among others. Because of the levels of corruption, the country always ranks near the bottom of Transparency International's (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index. In 2023, only eight countries were lower on a scale of 180 countries worldwide, where the country ranked highest is perceived to have the most honest public sector. Only two countries were ranked lower in sub-Saharan Africa. It is the only nation in the world since 2008 to receive a score of 'zero' for budget transparency. In 2008, a U.S. State Department report indicated that officials in Equatorial Guinea are frequently engaging in corruption and illegal practices with impunity. In 2014, the country received a score of zero on TI's Open Budget Index. From 1996 to 2013, the Economic Intelligence Unit gave the country a score of 0.0 for \"control of corruption\". On the National Resource Governance Institute's Resource Governance Index, Equatorial Guinea received a \"failing\" score of 13/100, ranking 56th out of 58 countries. On \"reporting practices\", it received a score of 14/100, for a rank of 55th. In 2011, Freedom House put Equatorial Guinea in its \"worst of the worst\" category for governments that violate human rights and civil liberties. This category also includes North Korea, Sudan, and Turkmenistan. In its 2014 world report, Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated: \"Corruption, poverty, and repression continue to plague Equatorial Guinea. ... Vast oil revenues fund lavish lifestyles for the small elite surrounding the president, while a large proportion of the population continues to live in poverty. Mismanagement of public funds and credible allegations of high-level corruption persist, as do other serious abuses, including arbitrary detention, secret detention, and unfair trials.\" == President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasog == President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has been the leader of Equatorial Guinea since 1979 when he seized power in a coup.
