A metropolis is usually an important city and its surroundings. ==Eastern Orthodox== In the Eastern Orthodox Church, a metropolis (also called metropolia or metropolitanate) is a type of diocese. Other types are eparchies, exarchates, and archdioceses. In Greek Orthodox Churches, every diocese is a metropolis, and its head is a metropolitan. Other bishops are auxiliary bishops (helper bishops). ==Catholic Church== In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, a metropolis is the main church area of a church province. The leader is a metropolitan archbishop, and the metropolis is an archdiocese. It has at least one smaller church area, called a suffragan diocese. In the Eastern Catholic Churches, a metropolitanate is a self-ruling church but smaller than a patriarchate. It is led by one metropolitan bishop. ==Related pages== * Archbishop ad personam ==References== Category:Christian terminology Category:Church organization Category:Eastern Orthodox Church",
