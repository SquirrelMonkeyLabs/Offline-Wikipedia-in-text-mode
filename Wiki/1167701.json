 "text": "The Irish slaves myth is a conspiracy theory that says Irish slaves existed in 17th-century North America before the arrival of African slaves. * * * * * * * * * * ==Origin== The myth first appeared in To Hell Or Barbados: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ireland, a book written by Irish journalist Seán O'Callaghan (1918 – 2000) and published by The O'Brien Press in Dublin, Ireland. Since 2013, the myth has been popularized by Neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers in both Ireland and the United States. ==Reception== Scholars have widely condemned this myth as a far-right conspiracy theory that downplays African Americans' suffering throughout American history. African Americans were enslaved until 1865; they were segregated until 1965; and they continue to experience systematic, institutional racism. * * * * * Even though O'Callaghan's book promoted the widely condemned, far-right \"Irish slaves\" myth, it is still sold at the Sinn Féin Bookshop run by the Irish nationalist Sinn Féin party.* * * * * ==Related pages== * Racism * Afrophobia * The Troubles * Disinformation * Historical revisionism ==References== Category:Racism Category:Ireland Category:United States Category:Disinformation Category:Conspiracy theories Category:History of the United States Category:21st century in the United States",
