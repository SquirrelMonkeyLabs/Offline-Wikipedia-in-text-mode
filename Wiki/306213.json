 "text": "Bionic is the sixth studio album by American pop singer Christina Aguilera, released on June 4, 2010. The album was made due to her love for electronic music and mixes pop, R&B;, and electronic sounds. The first half has fast songs with electronic beats, while the second half has slower songs. The lyrics focus on confidence, independence, and relationships. At first, Bionic got mixed reviews, but over time, more people have come to appreciate it. The album started at number three on the US Billboard 200, selling 117,000 copies in its first week. It also reached the top ten in several countries and was number one in the UK, though it became the lowest-selling UK number-one album in eight years at the time. The album had four singles: “Not Myself Tonight” in April 2010, “Woohoo” in May, “You Lost Me” in June, and “I Hate Boys” in September. Aguilera promoted Bionic by performing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, American Idol, Today, and the MTV Movie Awards. She planned a tour for the album, but it was canceled because she was busy promoting her movie Burlesque. ==Track listing== ; Deluxe Edition ; iTunes Bonus Track Category:2010 albums Category:Christina Aguilera albums",
