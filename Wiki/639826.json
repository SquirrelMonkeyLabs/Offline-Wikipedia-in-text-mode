His nicknames were \"Mooney\", \"Momo\", \"Sam the Cigar\", and \"Sammy\". On June 19, 1975, a gunman entered Giancana's basement kitchen and shot him in the back of the head as he was frying sausage and peppers at his Oak Park, Illinois home. After Giancana fell to the floor, the gunman turned him over and shot him six more times in the face and neck. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Murders by firearm in the United States Category:Burials at Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside) Category:Chicago Outfit mobsters Category:Assassinated American people",
