 "text": "New York City English (also called New York English) is a regional dialect of American English. It is spoken by many people in New York City and the New York metropolitan area. The dialect is known through its use in media. It is most often used in New York City itself and its nearby suburbs. However, it is used all across the metropolitan area. The dialect is known for dropping the \"r\" in some words. For example, the word cart in New York sounds similar to cot or caught. Some New York area people say tawk for talk (which sounds like toak, producing a « trumpet effect »). There are many well known people and fictional characters who speak New York English. They include Archie Bunker, Bugs Bunny, Fran Drescher and Marisa Tomei. ==References== Category:New York City Category:American English",
