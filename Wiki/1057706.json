 "text": "Since Alaska became a U.S. state in 1959, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years, and member(s) of the House to two-year terms. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Alaska elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1906 to 1959. These are lists of congressional delegations from Alaska to the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. ==Current delegation== Current U.S. senators from Alaska Current U.S. senators from Alaska Current U.S. senators from Alaska {| class=\"wikitable\" CPVI : {| class=\"wikitable\" Alaska's current congressional delegation in the has two senators, who are both Republicans and its only representative, who is a Democrat.

The terms of the two senators are delayed so that they are not elected in the same year, so each seat also has a class making the years in which the seat will be voted for. Alaska's senators are elected in classes 2 and 3. There have been eight senators from Alaska, four have been Democrats and four have been Republicans. William Egan and Ernest Gruening were elected to the Senate on October 6, 1956 for the 84th Congress but did not take the oath of office and were not given the senator's powers, since Alaska was not yet a state. Alaska's current senators, both Republicans, are Dan Sullivan, in office since 2015, and Lisa Murkowski, in office since 2002.
