 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic first entered the U.S. state of Nebraska in early March 2020. As of July 12, 2021, over 225,000 people in the state had been infected by COVID-19. Just over 2,260 people in the state were killed by the virus. As of May 28, 2021, Nebraska had given almost 1.7 million doses in COVID-19 vaccines. The state had fully vaccinated well over 867,000 people, about 45% of the Nebraska population. The first case of COVID-19 in the state happened Friday, March 6. That case was a thirty-six-year-old woman that had just returned to the United States after having traveled to England. The first two COVID-19 deaths were reported within three weeks of the first COVID-19 case in Nebraska. The first was a man in his fifties from Douglas County. The man had begun quarantining at his residence the day before. Just before 6pm that same Friday, a female in her sixties was the second death from the COVID-19 virus in the state. The woman was from Hall County. Just under three weeks following the first reported COVID case in Nebraska, the state had almost seven dozen cases by Friday, March 27. By Friday, April 17, the number of Nebraska COVID-19 cases had gone past 1,000. In mid-April 2020, a strong explosion in cases associated with meat packing plants started emerging. By April 21, 237 coronavirus cases were linked with a JBS plant in Grand Island alone. By April 28, coronavirus cases in Nebraska had more than tripled in only eleven days to reach 3,374. ==References== Nebraska Category:2020s in Nebraska",
