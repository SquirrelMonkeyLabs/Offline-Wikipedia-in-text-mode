 "text": "\"Dear Child” (originally: \"Liebes Kind\") is a 2019 psychological thriller novel by German writer Romy Hausmann. The main character, Lena Beck, is a young woman who has been missing for 14 years. When Lena is hit by a car and taken to the hospital with her young daughter, the hospital staff contacts Lena's father. However, when he arrives, he claims that Lena is not his daughter. This statement is further complicated when DNA tests confirm that Lena's two children are his biological grandchildren. Eventually, the tests reveal that Lena’s captor, a man called Lars Rogner, is the biological link Rogner abducted Lena, locked her in a secluded cabin without windows for years, and forced her to be his \"wife\" and birth his children. Shortly after Lena gave birth to their third child, both the child and mother passed away. A devastated Lars, who claimed to truly love Lena, kidnapped another woman named Jasmin Grass to replace Lena and assume her identity. Jasmin adopted the role for four months in captivity to survive, but she was able to knock Lars unconscious and escape with Lena's daughter. Near the house, Jasmin is hit by a car and then taken to the hospital. Despite still grappling with the physical and psychological effects of what she’s experienced, Jasmin convinces the police she’s stable enough to return home. Once back in her apartment, Jasmin realizes the profound psychological toll the abduction has taken, while remaining fearful of leaving her home and struggling to maintain a grasp on reality. The book was made into a Netflix miniseries in 2023. ==References== Category:2019 books Category:2010s books",
