It is written in Arabic. The Perfumed Garden is an example of erotic literature and contains sex among humans (heterosexual and homosexual) and animals. The book was first translated into English by Richard Francis Burton in 1886. He translated it through a French translation. He could not complete his translation because the book was not widely acceptable because of its content. After him a new French translation by René R. Khawam was published in 1976. In 1923, the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo. ==References== * The Perfumed Garden of Sensual Delight, Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi, translated by Jim Colville, 1999, Kegan Paul International, , 82 pages. * La prairie parfumée ou s'ébattent les plaisirs, Umar Ibn Muhammad Nafzawi , translated by René R.
