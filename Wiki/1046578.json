 "text": "Stone lifting, also known as \"Harri jasotzea\" in Spain, is a traditional sport that has been around for centuries. Farmers and fishermen who were challenged with rocky terrain had to come up with a game to excel in their daily tasks and to clear their land. The rules were simple- to lift a massive stone to stomach, chest, and shoulder height. With time, these essential activities evolved into real sports alongside whaleboat racing, wood chopping and sheep fighting. Category:Sports",
