 "text": "Nils Gustaf Ekholm (9 October 1848 – 5 April 1923) was a Swedish meteorologist. He led a Swedish geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen in 1882–1883.The biography is based on Anders Ångström, \"Ekholm, Nils Gustaf\", in Svenskt biografiskt lexikon, vol. 12 (1949), pp. 720–725. In 1899 Ekholm pointed out that, at present rates, coal burning might eventually double the concentration of atmospheric CO2. Ekholm was a friend of Svante Arrhenius, who first predicted that burning coal would raise the global temperature. == References == Category:Swedish scientists Category:Meteorologists Category:19th-century Swedish people Category:1848 births Category:1923 deaths",
