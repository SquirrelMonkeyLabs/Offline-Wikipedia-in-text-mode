 "text": "PBS Kids Go! was an American educational television brand distributed by PBS programs aimed for elementary and middle school children, in comparison to the younger targeted PBS Kids. The broadcast on PBS stations during two afternoon hours on weekdays through 3:00pm to 5:00pm. The program opened on October 11, 2004 and closed on October 7, 2013. ==History== PBS Kids Go! programming block was launched on October 11, 2004, the three series followed by Arthur, Cyberchase, and DragonFlyTV. With the PBS Kids network for PBS Kids Sprout on September 26, 2005, PBS Kids Go continued on PBS. In April 2006, PBS announced that, in October 2006, a 24-hour digital multicast network called PBS Kids Go! Channel would be launched with additional content. Slated were several programming blocks, an evening Go! family block targeted at both children and their families, a Spanish language-programming block, \"PBS Kids Vayan!\" and a school block. KidsWorld Sports, HIT Entertainment's Wishbone reruns and Kratts' Creatures were planned as exclusive programs for the network. These exclusive shows plus those from the PBS block would total seven hours of original programming. At this time, PBS planned on adding one or two new series per year. The network was to be fee-based, allowing those stations that subscript to place the network's exclusive programs on their analog channel if they wish. A branded interactive club was also part of the plan, with stations working it into their existing club or starting a new club and branding it how they would like to. With only one third of PBS stations affiliating with the network and half needed on July 6, 2006, the network was withdrawn. PBS left open the possibility to re-offer the network. Stations found that the sliding scale licensing fees were too high for what little exclusive programming they received, especially after spending additional funds for the PBS HD feed. On February 28, 2007, Design Squad premiered. ==See also== * PBS * PBS Kids * Universal Kids ==References== Category:2000s establishments Category:2000s establishments in the United States Category:2004 establishments Category:2004 establishments in the United States Category:2010s disestablishments Category:2010s disestablishments in the United States Category:2013 disestablishments Category:2013 disestablishments in the United States Category:American television networks Go!
