 "text": "A truss is a structure that has beams, called members, across a structure such as a building or bridge to give it more support. ==Types== There are two basic types of truss: * The pitched truss, or common truss, uses triangular shaped bases. It is most often used for roof construction. * The parallel chord truss, or flat truss, gets its name from its parallel top and bottom chords. It is often used for floor construction. ==References== Category:Architectural elements",
