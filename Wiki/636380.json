 "text": "Maria Lourdes Aranal Sereno (born Maria Lourdes Punzalan Aranal; July 2, 1960) is a Filipino lawyer and judge. She was the de facto Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines from 2012 until her removal from office on May 11, 2018. Sereno was removed from office by way of quo warranto by Supreme Court in an 8â€“6 decision, removing her appointment as Chief Justice in 2012 null and void. Her removal was controversial because it was carried out by the Supreme Court, which some said was not in accordance with the constitution. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Chief justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Category:Lawyers from Manila",
