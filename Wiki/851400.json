There are different theories on the origin of the Bhagayari Kutta. According to the most popular theory, the Pakistani Shepherd Dog originated between a wolf and a domestic dog of some type, hence the name Pakistani Shepherd Dog (meaning “wolf dog”).

When not being worked they need to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle. While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human.

Without enough exercise, mental and physical, it will become bored and destructive, which will affect its good temperament.
