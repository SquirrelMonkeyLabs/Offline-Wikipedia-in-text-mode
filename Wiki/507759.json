 "text": "There are 92 association football teams in the top four tiers of English football. Each team has a manager or head coach. The Premier League and Football Leagues are the only fully professional football leagues in England. The Premier League has 20 clubs at the top of the English football league system. The other 72 clubs are split into the three divisions of the Football League: the Championship, League One, and League Two. Some of these managers were chosen as caretaker managers before the main job. A caretaker's start date is written in italics. Some managers have had more than one time in charge at their current club, however their time as manager is counted from the date of their latest club. Only one manager has spent more than 10 years in his current job. This list includes every manager currently managing a club in the Premier League and The Football League, in order of the date that they took up their job. ==Managers== Name Nat.
