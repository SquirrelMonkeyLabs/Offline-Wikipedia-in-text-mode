 "text": "Seeing Allah (Arabic: رؤية الله) is a much-discussed and controversial topic in Islam. There are various interpretations in the Quran and Hadith regarding whether the Islamic prophet Muhammad saw Allah during the ascension and in a dream. The disagreements over these interpretations have often led to extremist conflicts, with Islamic sects sometimes declaring each other as infidels. However, most Sunni scholars agree that Allah will be seen on the Day of Judgment. ==References== Category:Islam",
