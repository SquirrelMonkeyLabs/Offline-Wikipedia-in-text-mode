 "text": "A spliceosome is a complex of special RNA and protein subunits. Spliceosomes are amazingly complex molecular machines. They remove introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA segment. This process is generally referred to as splicing. Each spliceosome is composed of five small nuclear RNAs, (snRNA)s, and more than 50 proteins. == References == Category:Molecular biology Category:Organelles",
