Incense can be used to make a place smell better or to help improve mood. In Judaism, instructions for the use of incense were given in Exodus. (E.g. Exodus 30:1). In Christianity, Christ is given myrrh and frankincense by the wise men. (Gospel of Matthew 2:11) Incense is also used in Hindu rituals. ==Other websites== * Incense in Catholicism Category:Religious objects Category:Magic (paranormal) Category:Perfumery",
