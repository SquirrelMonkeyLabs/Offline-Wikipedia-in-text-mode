 "text": "Than Shwe (; ; born 2 February 1933) is a Burmese army general and politician, retired commander-in-chief and military ruler of Myanmar until 2010. He was the head of state of Burma from 1992 to 2011 as Chairman of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Occupying key positions, including Prime Minister of Myanmar, Commander-in-chief of Myanmar Defense Services, and head of the Union Solidarity and Development Association, he faced criticism for perceived undemocratic practices. In March 2011, Than Shwe officially stepped down as head of state, facilitating the transition to his chosen successor, Thein Sein, and as the head of the Armed Forces, being succeeded by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. Than Shwe continues to wield significant influence within the military. Than Shwe is suffering from diabetes and he is rumored to have colorectal cancer. ==References== ==Other websites== *Than Shwe at WN Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Myanmar Category:Prime Ministers of Myanmar Category:Burmese military people",
