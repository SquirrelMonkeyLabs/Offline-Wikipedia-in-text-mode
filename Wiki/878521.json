 "text": "Mole Attack is a video game version of the mechanical arcade game Whac-A-Mole. Commodore published it in 1981 for the Commodore VIC-20 and the PC-8001. ==Gameplay== Moles appear from 9 holes. The player has 60 seconds to hit as many moles as they can with a hammer. A joystick or the keyboard can be used. ==Reception== In a 1983 review for Electronic Games, Charlene Komar said: \"Mole Attack will probably be a favorite among younger arcaders. Even though the eye-catching graphics combine well with the time-limit excitement, adults will probably find the game too simple and repetitive to get too many repeat plays.\" ==References== ==Other websites== *1984 Software Encyclopedia from Electronic Games *The official PasocomMini PC-8001 website ; the PC-8001 version is included Category:1981 video games",
