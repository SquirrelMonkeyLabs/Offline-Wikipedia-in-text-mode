It premiered on Comedy Central in 1993, before moving to ABC in January 1997. On September 17, 2001, Bill Maher criticized United States foreign policy on the show and argued that the perpetrators of the September 11 terrorist attacks were not cowards. The comments were widely condemned, and while Maher later apologized, major advertisers stopped advertising with the show.[www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpâ€¦ The show was canceled in 2002. The show first originated from New York City, but soon moved to Los Angeles. The New York episodes were shot at the CBS Broadcast Center and the Los Angeles episodes at CBS Television City, where it remained even after its move to ABC.
