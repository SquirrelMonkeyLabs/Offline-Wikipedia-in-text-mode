 "text": "Car audio is technology in a car or other vehicle which plays sound. All can play radio, and most can also play digital media, such as discs or data from connected mobile phones. ==History== Car audio hobbyism has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s when aftermarket car audio systems became more available. Early enthusiasts experimented with adding components like cassette players, amplifiers, and speakers to improve the rudimentary stock systems provided by car companies. By the 1980s and 1990s, advancements in audio technology and growing demand led to the emergence of dedicated car audio brands such as Alpine, Pioneer, and JBL. In the 21st century, car audio became more digitally work, with systems having Bluetooth, smartphone connectivity, and advanced equalizers. Some also support high-resolution audio formats, active noise cancellation, and 3D soundscapes. Newer versions have touchscreen controls, streaming works, and digital signal processing. For example; the 2025 Porsches are getting Dobly Atmos for in-car audio. ==List of parts of a car audio system== # Head unit: The display and the buttons, with which users can control and change the car audio. Newer car audio systems often have touchscreen controls instead of physical buttons, later, they have physical buttons back instead of touchscreen controls. # Amplifiers: Enhance the signal strength to drive speakers and subwoofers effectively, reducing distortion and improving clarity. # Speakers: High-fidelity speakers, including component systems with separate tweeters, midrange drivers, and woofers, ensure detailed sound reproduction. # Subwoofers: Specialized for low-frequency sounds, subwoofers make the deep bass that audiophiles often prioritize. # Sound deadening materials: Insulation materials like Dynamat reduce road noise and vibrations, enhancing audio clarity. # Digital Signal Processors (DSPs): Allow for precise tuning of audio settings, such as equalization, crossover points, and time alignment. # System customization: Tailoring the systemâ€™s components to personal taste, including equalizer settings, speaker placement, and soundstage optimization. # Music source: High-quality music files (e.g., FLAC or DSD) or streaming services with lossless music. ==As a hobby== Many people are interested in car audio as a hobby. Popular meetup sites are online forums, as well as car audio competitions (like dB drag racing), and events where enthusiasts share tips, compare setups, and showcase their systems. For example these events are: * Car audio competitions: Organizations like the International Auto Sound Challenge Association (IASCA) host events where vehicles are judged on sound quality and system design. * Car meets and expos: Events like CES 2025 (Consumer Electronics Show) showcase the latest in-car audio technology. Online social media groups such as YouTube channels, and other social media groups are serve as hubs for enthusiasts to share advice, showcase installations, and talk about innovations. ==Related pages== * Audiophile ==References== ==Other websites== * International Auto Sound Challenge Association (IASCA) Category:Vehicles Category:Audio technology Category:Music",
