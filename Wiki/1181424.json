In the winter of 1231, in the ensuing confusion the Mongols arrived into Azerbaijan from the direction of Khorasan and Ray. The 30,000 strong Mongol army led by Chormagan easily defeated Jalal ad-Din and occupied northern Iran. ===Arran and Ganja=== Khwarazmshah retreated to Ganja. The Mongols followed him and captured Arran. ===Mayyafakarin=== Jalal ad-Din took refuge in the Mayyafarikin mountains and there in August of that year he was killed. Jalal ad-Din once again escaped from the Mongols and took refuge in the Silvan mountains and there in August he was killed by a Kurd who claimed that he was avenging his brother, who had been killed by Jalal ad-Din's forces in Ahlat. ==References== Category:13th- century conflicts Category:Wars involving Asia Category:History of Azerbaijan Category:Mongol peoples",
