Back then, the German Catholics mostly supported the Centre Party (German: Zentrumspartei). The conflict happened at a time when the values of the Enlightenment, nationalism, liberalism, secularism and scientific realism had replaced the Catholic Church in the political and intellectual domains of European societies. * * Knight, Frances. History of the Christian Church. Vol. 6: The Church in the 19th Century. I.B. Tauris, London, 2008, * Those values were condemned as \"false\" by the Catholic Church, which angered liberals and secularists across Europe. The separation of church and state had become a norm in several Western countries, which greatly reduced Catholic Church's influence over Europeans. Opposition to religious authority and anti-Catholic views were common, especially in the majority Protestant German Empire. ==Events== ===1871=== Historians believed that the conflict started in 1871 when Bismarck restricted priests from voicing political views and cancelled the Roman Catholic bureau in the Prussian Ministry of Culture. ===1872=== In March 1872, all religious schools came under state control. In June 1872, all religious teachers could no longer work at state schools, with the dissolution of the Jesuit order in Germany and the end of diplomatic ties with the Vatican in December. ===1873=== Prussian minister of culture Adalbert Falk announced the May Laws to put church appointments and religious training under state control. ===1874=== The German Catholic Centre Party doubled their seats in the Reichstag (Imperial German Parliament). Bismarck started to walk back on his policies as he formed the perception that he could not dominate over the Catholics. Bismarck also wanted to gain Catholic support for his struggle against the Social Democrats. ===1875=== Dioceses (areas overseen by bishops) that did not comply with the May Laws were denied state aid. Clergy were also exiled for resistance. The year is seen by some historians as the climax of the Kulturkampf. ===1878=== It is said that only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, about 1,125 of 4,600 parishes became vacant, and 1,800 priests were either sent to jail or driven into exile, along with thousands of commoners who allegedly helped them evade the laws. German jurist and diplomat Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken (1830–1896) commented on Bismarck's policies:A Supreme Court in the culture wars by Jeremy Rabkin in the Fall edition of the Public Interest ===1887=== Pope Leo XIII declared the Kulturkampf over, when most of the laws against the German Catholics had been cancelled. The decade-long conflict consolidated German Catholic support for the Centre Party and parliamentary democracy by which they voted the party into becoming the second-largest party in the German Parliament.Hajo Holborn, A History of Modern Germany: 1840–1945 (1969), 258–260 The Centre Party stayed as a powerful force in the following half a century until Germany fell under Nazi rule.
