 "text": "Boaz was a man from the Book of Ruth. He was related to Ruth’s husband who had died without any children so she asked Boaz to marry her. He told her that there was a man who was more closely related to her husband than he was so she should try him first. Then Boaz told the person known as Ploni Almoni this and Ploni Almoni spit in a shoe so he would not have to marry Ruth. Then Boaz married Ruth and she gave birth to a son Obed. Obed became the father of Jesse and Jesse became the father of David. Category:Old Testament people",
