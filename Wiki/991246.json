 "text": "The 2023 New Zealand general election was held on 14 October 2023 to determine the 54th Parliament of New Zealand. Voters elected 120 members to the New Zealand House of Representatives under the mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, a proportional representation system in which 72 members were elected from single-member electorates and 48 members from closed party lists. The incumbent centre-left Labour majority government, led by Chris Hipkins, tried to win a third term in government. However, they were defeated by the centre-right National Party, led by Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon, in a landslide. National will need support from the ACT party (and possibly also New Zealand First) to form government. At the 2020 election, the centre-left Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, won an outright majority in the House. The main opponents to the Labour government is the centre-right National Party, led by Christopher Luxon, and the right-wing ACT party, led by David Seymour. On 19 January 2023, Ardern announced she would resign as Labour leader and prime minister before 7 February. ==Candidates== File:Chris Hipkins NZ Labour (cropped).jpg|Prime Minister Chris Hipkins (Labour Party) from Remutaka File:Christopher Luxon (crop).jpg|Opposition Leader Christopher Luxon (National Party) from Botany File:Aotearoa New Zealand Green Leadership 2020.jpg|Members of Parliament James Shaw and Marama Davidson (Green Party) for List File:David Seymour (cropped).jpg|Member of Parliament David Seymour (ACT) from Epsom File:Purple - replace this image female.tif|Member of Parliament Debbie Ngarewa-Packer (MƒÅori Party) for List == Opinion polls == ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== *Electoral Commission website Category:New Zealand general elections Category:2023 elections Category:2020s in New Zealand",
