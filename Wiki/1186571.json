Sejong was founded in 2007 as the new planned capital of South Korea from many parts of the South Chungcheong Province and some parts of North Chungcheong Province to create less congestion in Seoul. The construction of the city is expected to be done in 2030, at which time 500,000 people are expected to live there. ==References== Category:Cities in South Korea",
