 "text": "Feodor Vassilyev (; c. 1707 â€“ 1782), was a Russian peasant from Shuya, Russia. Supposedly his first wife lived to be 76 years old, and between 1725 and 1766, he had 69 children (16 sets of twins, 7 sets of triplets, and 4 sets of quadruplets), 67 of them surviving with the loss of just one set of babies, and twins. Vassilyev's first wife would thus mark the record for the largest number of children born to a single woman; even so, few details are known of her life, such as her name and date of birth or death. Vassilyev also allegedly fathered 18 children with his second wife, who had 6 sets of twins and 2 sets of triplets, making him the father of a total of 87 children. It is believed that of his 87 children, at least 82 survived infancy. == References == Category:1707 births Category:1782 deaths",
