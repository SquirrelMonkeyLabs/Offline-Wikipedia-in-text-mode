 "text": "Osteocephalus duellmani is a frog in the family Hylidae. It lives in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Cordillera del CÃ³ndor. This was 1910 meters above sea level. At least one adult male frog was 48.1 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog lives in cloud forests where the trees grow close together and there is water in the air. The scientists who caught the frog saw smaller plants growing on the trees and the trees were covered in moss. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
