 "text": "Thomas Jonathan Jackson (1824â€“1863) was a leading Confederate general of the American Civil War. He earned the name \"Stonewall\" after the First Battle of Bull Run. He was frequently called the most brilliant strategist in the Confederate Army. Jackson was considered Robert E. Lee's \"right hand\". Jackson was mortally wounded at the Battle of Chancellorsville. On May 2, 1863, he was scouting ahead of his lines when one of his own men mistakenly shot him. His left arm was badly wounded requiring the doctors to amputate it two inches below his shoulder. He died on May 10, 1863. He was 39 years old. He likely died of a pulmonary embolism and not from pneumonia. == References == Category:1824 births Category:1863 deaths Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:Confederate Army generals Category:Military people from Virginia",
