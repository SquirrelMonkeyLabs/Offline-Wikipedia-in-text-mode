 "text": "The PlayStation Network is where you can sign up for free to play games. At one time hackers shut down the network, but later PlayStation Network returned online. PlayStation Network has a paid service known as PlayStation Plus, with three tiers. Essential, which allows online plays, Extra, which is similar to Xbox Game Pass Core, allowing for extra games, and Premium, which gives the ability to stream and download PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable games, and stream PlayStation 3 games, plus the PlayStation Plus Extra Library. The PlayStation Network also allows access to the PlayStation Store, where users can purchase and download video games for the PlayStation family of systems. ==References== Category:Sony Category:PlayStation (brand)",
