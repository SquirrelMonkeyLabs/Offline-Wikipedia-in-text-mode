Her love life with the first president of Botswana, Sir Seretse Khama was filled with controversies. They got kicked out of the country because the bangwato tribe believed Khama broke the laws by marrying a white woman. Controversies spiked because the bangwato had grudges over the whites, claiming they were killers and manipulators. With many negotiations, the Khamas, Ruth and Seretse were able to return and eventually became the first president and first lady of Botswana. Category:Botswana politicians Category:First Ladies",
