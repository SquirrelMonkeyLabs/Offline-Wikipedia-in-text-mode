 "text": "There are 4 arrondissements in the Lot-et-Garonne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The 4 arrondissements of Lot-et-Garonne are: # Arrondissement of Agen, (prefecture: Agen), with 71 communes. # Arrondissement of Marmande, (subprefecture of the Lot-et-Garonne department: Marmande), with 98 communes. # Arrondissement of Villeneuve-sur-Lot, (subprefecture of the Lot-et-Garonne department: Villeneuve-sur-Lot), with 92 communes. # Arrondissement of Nérac, (subprefecture of the Lot-et-Garonne department: Nérac), with 58 communes. ==History== Since its creation, the Lot-et-Garonne department has had some changes: * 1790 : creation of the Lot-et-Garonne department with nine districts: Agen, Nérac, Marmande, Tonneins, Villeneuve, Lauzun, Monflanquin, Casteljaloux and Valence;Valence is a commune of Tarn-et-Garonne since 1808 the capital was Agen * 1800 : creation of the arrondissements: Agen, Marmande, Nérac, Villeneuve-sur-Lot * 1926 : the arrondissement of Nérac is eliminated * 1942 : Nérac is again an arrondissement On 4 November 1808, several of the original southeastern cantons in the arrondissements of Agen and Villeneuve- sur-Lot were separated from the Lot-et-Garonne to become a part of the newly created department of Tarn-et-Garonne. ==References== Category:Arrondissements of Lot-et-Garonne",
