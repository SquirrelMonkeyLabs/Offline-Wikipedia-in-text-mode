The Bhati Rajputs (also known as Bargala) claim Chandravanshi origin. == During Sikh rule (1799-1849) == During the Sikh reconquest of Mughal Domain in the late 18th century under deployments of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, it believed most of their hostages and princess were successfully recovered from the captivation of Muslim rulers. ==Origin and History== In Jaisalmer, the Bhati clan sometimes refer to themselves as the Yaduvanshi Rajput, reflecting their claimed mythological descent from Krishna and Yadu Some Bhati Rajputs were nomadic cattle-keepers. In the years preceding the Indian rebellion of 1857, these groups lost land by decisions made by the British East India Company, which assigned to Jat peasants grazing lands formerly frequented by the Bhatis in the Delhi and Haryana regions. The British were not enamoured of nomadic tribes, whom they thought exacted protection in the areas that they visited, and the policies of land reform were designed in part to limit this mobility. In some parts of modern Pakistan, some lower-caste's now also call themselves 'Bhattis'; a fact deeply resented by the authentic Bhatti Rajputs of Pakistan.Dr M Riyasat Husain 'Caste and clan in Northern and Central Punjab and some patterns of shift: An analysis' in Journal of South Asian Study Vol 2, No 8, 1992, Lahore, pp 21-46 ==References== Category:Rajputs",
