 "text": "Barium hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ba(OH)2. It contains barium and hydroxide ions. ==Properties== Barium hydroxide is a white solid. It dissolves in water to make a basic solution. It decomposes to barium oxide when heated in a vacuum. It reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate. It reacts with any sulfate to make barium sulfate. It reacts with hydrogen sulfide to make barium sulfide. ==Preparation== It is made by dissolving barium oxide in water. ==Uses== Barium hydroxide is used in titrations. If sodium hydroxide solution is used, some sodium carbonate may be in there. It is less basic than sodium hydroxide, so the titration can be messed up. When barium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate, it forms a white solid that can be removed. It is used as a strong base in organic chemistry. It is used to clean up sulfuric acid spills by making barium sulfate. It can also be used for removing ink marks from clothes. ==Safety== Barium hydroxide is corrosive because it is basic. It is also toxic because of barium ions. ==Related pages== *Barium peroxide Category:Barium compounds",
