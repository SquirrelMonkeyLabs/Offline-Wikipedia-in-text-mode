 "text": "The Lions have won four NFL championships. The Lions were the first franchise to finish a full (non-strike shortened) regular season with no wins or ties since the move to sixteen season games in 1978, going 0–16 during the 2008 NFL season. They are also one of four current teams, and the only one in the NFC, to have never played in the Super Bowl. ==Seasons== NFL champions (1950–1969) Super Bowl champions (1970–present) Conference
