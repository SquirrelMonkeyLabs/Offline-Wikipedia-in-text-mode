He became known because he was a successful general in the Third Punic War against Carthage. He was present, when Carthage was defeated and destroyed. He was also successful in the Numantine War in Spain. He also supported writers and philiosophers, called a patron. The most famous of these people he supported was probably the Greek historian Polybius. In politics, he opposed the populist reform program of his murdered brother-in-law, Tiberius Gracchus. == Notes == == References == === Ancient sources === * Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The Wars in Spain, Loeb Classical Library, Vol I, Books 1–8.1., Loeb, 1989; * Appian, Roman History, Book 8 Part 1, The Punic Wars, Loeb Classical Library, Vol III, Books 1–3.26., Loeb, 1989; * Appian, Roman History, Book 13, The Civil Wars (Book I) in Spain, Loeb Classical Library, Vol I, Books 1–81., Loeb, 1989; * Cicero, De oratore I-III, Bloomsbury 3PL; new edition, 2013; * Florus Epitome of Roman History, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015; * Plutarch, Tiberius Gracchus, Caius Gracchus, Romulus, in Plutarch's Lives (two volumes), Modern Library, 2001; Vol. 1 ; Vol 2 * Polybius, The Histories, Oxford World's Classics, OUP Oxford, 2010; * Velleius Paterculus, Roman History, Hackett Publishing, 2011; Category:Roman generals Category:180s BC Category:120s BC",
