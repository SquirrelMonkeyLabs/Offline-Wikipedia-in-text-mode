 "text": "In My Mind is the first studio album by American recording artist Pharrell Williams. It was released on July 25, 2006. The album features the hit single \"Can I Have It Like That\" which features singer Gwen Stefani. The album is mainly a hip hop album with a bit of R&B.; ==Reviews== The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics. ==Track listing== All songs produced by Pharrell Williams. ==Grammy Nomination== The album was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2007 Grammy Awards. It lost to Release Therapy by Ludacris. ==Notes== * A song titled \"Mamacita\", which featured reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee was leaked in early 2006. It was supposed to be the third single from the album, but it did not appear on the final track listing, nor was there a video for the song. However it is featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. * Not on the official album, \"Big White Spaceship\" (featuring Timbaland & Magoo) is actually an early project with Timbaland & Magoo called Surrounded by Idiots. Pharrell recalls in an interview: \"In seventh grade I met Chad. That's twenty years ago by now. Like I said earlier, we started producing beats together. But then again, I also played with this famous group which consisted of Timbaland, Magoo, myself and some other guy. Chad wasn't a part of the group, so I was in The Neptunes and in Surrounded by Idiots at the same time.\" A few tracks produced by the group float around on the Internet, this being the most distributed. * The song \"Skateboard P Presents: Show You How to Hustle\" is featured in the game Need for Speed: Carbon. * Other songs presumed to be B-sides or possibly just unreleased Pharrell compositions include \"Creamsickle\" and \"I Need Love\". * The album cover is a reference to the art style of BAPE, a Japanese street clothing company that is popular in the urban scene. Williams and founder Nigo launched the first American store in New York together. * The initial pressing offered buyers a choice of three covers: each cover had Pharrell pictured with either a blue Ice Cream sweater, red and white Polo Shirt, or white Billionaire Boys Club T-shirt as shown in the album cover. * A remixed version of the album, titled \"Out of My Mind\", was produced. It was never officially released. This remixed version of the album featured interpolated instrumentals by drummer Questlove and James Poyser of the hip hop band the Roots. ==Charts and certifications== ===Charts=== Chart (2006) Peak position Japanese Albums (Japanese Albums Chart) 8 ===Certifications=== ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Debut albums Category:Hip hop albums Category:Pharrell Williams Category:R&B; albums",
