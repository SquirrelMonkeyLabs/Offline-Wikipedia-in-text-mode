 "text": "The sanguine poison frog, sanguine poison-arrow frog, or Zaparo's poison frog (Allobates zaparo) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador and Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog is 27.0 to 30.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 26.5 - 30.5 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is red in color with light brown or copper colored lines that start on the nose. The sides of the head and body are black in color with brown on top and white on the bottom. The white stripe may turn blue toward the rear of the body. There is a green- yellow mark on the mouth. The tops of the front legs are light brown in color with black or dark brown spots. There is yellow or orange color where the front legs meet the body. The tops of the back legs are black in color with blue-gray marks. The bottoms of the hind legs or blue in color with black marks. The throat and chest are black in color but may have some blue color. The blue becomes an orange stripe near where the front legs meet the body. The belly is blue with black marks. The iris of the eye is black in color with some bronze or copper near the middle. This frog does not have poison chemicals in its skin, but its stripes and colors look like those of other frogs in Dendrobatidae. Because of this, scientists call this frog a mimic. It looks like poisonous frogs to trick animals that want to eat it into thinking that it has poison too. A. zaparo looks like A. bilinguis, which has some poison but not a lot. Scientists think this is because animals that try to eat the frog learn exactly what it looks like. ==Food== This frog can eat many kinds of things. For example, it eats ants. ==Name== Scientists named this frog zaparo for the Sápara people who live in eastern Ecuador. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. People see it in forests in low places and on hills, mostly in forests that have never been cut down but sometimes in forests that were destroyed and are growing back and near streams near farms. People have seen it on the dead leaves on the ground. Scientists saw the frog between 200 and 1000 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in many protected parks: Yasuní National Park, Sangay National Park, Yachana Reserve, and Jatun Sacha Biological Station. ==Young== The male frog sits above the dead leaves on the ground and calls to the female frogs. The female frogs lays their eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms, make places for animals to eat grass, and make roads to dig for oil. Bad chemicals from farms, humans' animals, and mining can also hurt the frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
