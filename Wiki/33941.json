Its Celtic name was Argentorate (which the Romans called Argentoratum). People think this name is linked to the river Ill (that flows into the Rhine near Strasbourg). At that time, it was on the Limes, a fortification the Romans built across Europe (to keep out the Germanic tribes). There was a fortification (named castella drusi, drusus fort) at that spot. Soldiers need to live from something, so a local civilian settlement developed there. Later, the Limes was pushed farther east. == Climate == Strasbourg has an oceanic climate (Cfb in the Köppen climate classification). == Education == * École nationale supérieure d'informatique pour l'industrie et l'entreprise * École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies * École pour l'informatique et les techniques avancées * EM Strasbourg Business School * Institut supérieur européen de gestion group * ISG Programme Business & Management * Web@cademie ==References== Category:Imperial free cities Category:World Heritage Sites in France",
