 "text": "Habit in biology is about the shape or behaviour of animals and plants. ==Botany== The way plants grow makes their shape of habit. This is the way we can tell trees apart even at a distance. The shape of a willow tree or a poplar is very distinct. It is made during growth. Bacteria and fungi also have very distinct types of growth. Trees are also examples of a life style when compared to shrubs and annual plants. To be a tree is to occupy a different space in the ecosystem from shrubs or climbers. ==Zoology== In zoology, habit often refers to a specific behaviour of a species. For example: * ...the [cat] was in the habit of springing upon the [door knocker] in order to gain admission... * The spider monkey has an arboreal habit and rarely ventures onto the forest floor. * The brittlestar has the habit of breaking off arms as a means of defence. The 'mode of life' (or 'lifestyle') is sometimes referred to as the 'habit of an animal. Terms like motile or sessile, sedentary, free-living, parasitic, saprophyte, terrestrial, arboreal, aquatic, pelagic, diurnal, nocturnal, are all modes of life or habits. ==References== Category:Biology",
