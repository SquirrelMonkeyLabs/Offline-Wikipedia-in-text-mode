Several teams have already qualified through their respective continental championships. For example, Saudi Arabia secured qualification by defeating China 1–0 in the quarterfinals of the 2023 AFC U-20 Asian Cup. Meanwhile, defending champions Uruguay failed to qualify after finishing fifth in the 2025 South American U-20 Championship. The official emblem for the tournament was unveiled on 5 February 2025. It draws inspiration from Chile’s distinctive landscape, including the Andes Mountains, the Pacific Ocean, and the national colors. The tournament mascot, \"Vito\" — a viscacha native to the region — was introduced on 24 May 2025 to represent the country’s natural heritage and youthful spirit. The official draw for the tournament is set to take place in Santiago on 29 May 2025. It will determine the group stage pairings for the 24 qualified teams. All matches will be held in selected cities across Chile, with final confirmation of venues expected soon. *Sources: [FIFA.com](https://www.fifa.com), [ESPN](https://www.espn.com), [Geo News](https://www.geosuper.tv)*",
