It was released in both compact disc and vinyl formats. The vinyl release contains two extra tracks, \"Edit the Sad Parts\" and \"A Manic Depressive Named Laughing Boy\". \"Edit the Sad Parts\" was later included on Interstate 8 and the Up Records compilation, US. \"A Manic Depressive Named Laughing Boy\" is available only on the vinyl editions released by Up in 1996 and Glacial Pace in 2014. Many of the tracks are about traveling by automobile, and the loneliness and isolation associated with rural life.
