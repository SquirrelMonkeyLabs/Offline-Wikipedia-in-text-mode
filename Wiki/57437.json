 "text": "Mountain climbing is a hobby/job where people climb mountains. It may involve hiking, rock climbing, as well as crossing glaciers. Someone who does mountain climbing is called a mountain climber or mountaineer. Mountain climbers use the strength of their arms and legs to climb up mountains. Many mountain climbers use ropes and wear special shoes and safety equipment . Most mountain climbers go up mountains as a hobby or as a recreational activity. A few do mountain climbing as an occupation or job. They get paid by outdoor clothing companies or universities to climb up mountains, or they are hired as a guide by recreational mountain climbers. Some are scientists who study mountains. Climbing mountains can be dangerous. Each year, people are seriously injured or even killed from falling, being covered in an avalanche of snow, or getting too cold. Altitude sickness can cause accidents. Climbers in snowy areas face the danger of being buried in an avalanche of snow. To reduce the risks, mountain climbers work together and learn how to climb safely. They wear safety equipment such as helmets and use ropes, compasses, and first aid kits. They bring other equipment, such as shovels, radio transmitters, and long poles (for finding people who are buried in the snow) and emergency GPS. == References ==",
