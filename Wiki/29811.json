The Titan god of the constellations, Krios ruled over the southern corner of the world, which he received as a reward for his part in Ouranos’ castration (he held down one of Ouranos’ arms). Like his brothers, Krios was cast into Tartarus at the end of the Titanomachy. His wife was the minor goddess Eurybia, daughter of Pontus and Gaia, with whom he sired Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses.
