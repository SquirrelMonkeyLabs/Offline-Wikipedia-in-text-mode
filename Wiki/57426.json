 "text": "A bullet-proof vest (also called \"bulletproof vest\", \"body armor\" or \"body armour\") is a protective piece of clothing that covers the torso (chest, abdomen, and back) of a person. It protects the wearer from most pistol and revolver bullets and from fragments of explosive devices such as grenades. Bullet-proof vests are worn by police officers, soldiers, security guards, and people who are at risk of being shot (such as the leader of a country). == How do they work? == Bullet-proof vests contain many layers of tightly-woven fabric such as Kevlar (or hard, strong materials such as ceramic or titanium) which can stop the metal pistol or revolver bullets or metal shell fragments from going into a person's body. == How much protection does a bullet-proof vest provide? == When a bullet hits a bullet-proof vest, the forceful impact of the bullet can seriously hurt, or even kill, the person wearing the vest even if the vest stops the bullet. A bullet from a strong sniper rifle or machine gun can pierce a bullet-proof vest. If a bullet hits a body part that the bullet-proof vest does not cover, the bullet can hurt or kill the person wearing the vest. ==Types of vests== The bullet-proof vests worn by most police officers and security guards are made with many layers of tightly-woven fabric such as Kevlar. Bullet-proof vests for soldiers are heavier and stronger than the bullet-proof vests worn by police officers and security guards, because soldiers need protection from rifle and machine gun bullets. Bullet-proof vests for soldiers often have flat pieces of ceramic material or a strong metal such as titanium. These materials can stop bullets from many rifles and machine guns. ==Related pages== * Helmet- soldiers and some types of police officers (called tactical police officers) also wear helmets to protect themselves Category:Protective clothing Category:Armour Category:Military",
