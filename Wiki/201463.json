He came from a religious family of Islamic scholars near Kandahar. After Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1979, he joined the Afghan mujahideen to fight in the Sovietâ€“Afghan War. He served as an important military general during several skirmishes, losing his right eye in an explosion. Between 1996 and 2001, he was Afghanistan's de facto head of state. Three states officially recognised him under the title of 'Head of the Supreme Council'. He was born in 1959 in Kandahar Province of Afghanistan.Rashid, Taliban, (2001) p.23 He held the title Commander of the Faithful from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

Some Taliban sources denied that he had died; other sources considered the report to be speculative, designed to destabilise peace negotiations in Pakistan between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

It was later learned that he died in Afghanistan, not Pakistan. == References == * Category:1959 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Deaths from tuberculosis Category:Pashtun people Category:Taliban Category:Heads of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan Category:Former dictators Category:Kandahar Province Category:21st-century Afghan people Category:20th-century Afghan people",
