 "text": "In the performing arts industry such as theatre, film, or television, casting, or a casting call, is a pre-production process for selecting a certain type of actor, dancer, singer, or extra to land the role of a character in a script, screenplay, or teleplay. This process may be used for a motion picture, television program, documentary film, music video, play, or advertisement intended for an audience. == The Casting Process == The casting process usually follows these steps: # Casting Call: A public or private announcement is made to let performers know that roles are open. This is often done by a casting director or agency. Casting calls may include details like: #* Age range #* Gender #* Appearance or skills #* Role description # Auditions: Actors or performers are invited to show their skills in front of casting directors. They may read lines, sing, dance, or act out scenes from the script. Auditions can be: #* Open (anyone can attend) #* Closed (by invitation only) #* Online submissions # Callbacks: Some performers are invited back for a second or third audition. They may perform with other actors to check for chemistry or compatibility. # Final Selection: The director or producer, often with the casting director, makes the final decision. They choose the best person for each role based on talent, fit, and sometimes experience or popularity.",
