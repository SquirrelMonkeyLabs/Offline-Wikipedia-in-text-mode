 "text": "Hammond Pond Reservation is a woodland park in Newton, Massachusetts. Hammond Pond is located within the park. The park is a part of the Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston. The first piece of land that would become the park was bought from John Lowell in 1916. There are trails there that go to Webster Woods and Houghton Garden. The MBTA Green Line (Riverside Branch) runs through the park from East to West, and the Hammond Pond Parkway runs through the park from North to South. Hammond Pond is as a Massachusetts \"Great pond\". The pond and reservation are named after the Hammond family, which settled in the area in the 17th century. ==Image gallery== File:Hammond Pond Reservation, Chestnut Hill MA.jpg|Walking trail File:Hammond Pond P1100495.jpg|Rock climbing File:Hammond Pond 20190710 202448.jpg|Sunset File:Hammond Pond P1000707.jpg|MBTA Green Line train File:Hammond Pond P1060152.jpg|Great Blue Heron File:Hammond Pond P1150925.jpg|Hammond Pond and The Street at Chestnut Hill shopping center ==References== ==Other websites== *Hammond Pond Reservation Department of Conservation and Recreation *Webster Woods and Hammond Pond Newton Conservators Category:Geography of Massachusetts Category:State parks in the United States",
