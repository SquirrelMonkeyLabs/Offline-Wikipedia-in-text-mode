Gordon Brown travelled to Buckingham Palace and tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to The Queen. David Cameron was appointed in Brown’s place and invited to form a new government. Nick Clegg became Deputy Prime Minister. After the 2015 general election, Cameron formed a majority government.
