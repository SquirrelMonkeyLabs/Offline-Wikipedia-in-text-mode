 "text": "The American Mayapple is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern part of North America. The stem can grow up to 30-40 cm tall. The plant produces two distinct growth forms. The first form, which has a single umbrella-like leaf, doesn't make any flowers or fruit. The second growth form consists of twin leaves (sometimes three), and a single white flower with six (rarely up to nine) petals, typically measuring 3-5 cm in diameter. This flower matures into a yellow-greenish fruit, which can grow 2-5 cm long. The plant usually grows in groups in open woodlands, with individual shoots often connected by systems of thick roots. Despite its name, \"mayapple\", it is actually a flower that appears in early May, not an \"apple,\" which appears later in the summer. The American Mayapple goes by several other names, including the Devil's apple, hogapple, Indian apple, umbrella plant, wild lemon, wild mandrake, and American mandrake. According to Brian Fondren, the mayapple has been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, originally by Native Americans and later by other settlers. == Toxicity == All the parts of the plant, except the fruit, are poisonous. The plant can kill a person in 24 hours. Even the fruit, which is not dangerously poisonous, can cause red or yellow diarrhea. Category:Ranunculales Category:Plants of North America",
