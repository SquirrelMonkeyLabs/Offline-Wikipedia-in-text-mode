After crashing into a crane, he got out of the truck with two firearms and began to shoot at police. Officers fatally shot him. At least 16 people were killed, including the suspect, and at least 35 others were injured, including 2 police officers who were shot. The attack happened during New Year celebrations in the city, which was scheduled to host the college football Sugar Bowl game later that day. The jihadist flag of the Islamic State was found inside the truck. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism. ==Responses== The New Orleans Saints, of the National Football League (NFL), and Pelicans, of the National Basketball Association (NBA), both issued condolences for the victims and their loved ones. The Saints announced that tighter security plans would be announced \"in the coming weeks,\" as the Saints' stadium, Caesars Superdome, is set to be the host of Super Bowl LIX. The NFL acknowledged the \"focus [should remain on] our neighbors, friends, and visitors.\" Additionally, the Sugar Bowl college football championship was postponed due to the attack. U.S. President Joe Biden also issued condolences and condemned the attacks.
