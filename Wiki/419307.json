 "text": "Tenant farming is when the person who works the farmland does not own the land themselves. The farmer pays rent to the landowner, either with cash or with a portion of the produce. When the rent is a share of the crop, it is sharecropping. Many freed slaves during the Reconstruction of the United States who owned no land became tenant farmers, renting land from a great landowner. Category:Agriculture Category:Labor",
