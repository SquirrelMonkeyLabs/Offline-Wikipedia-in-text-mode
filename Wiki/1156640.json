His book was advertised in national newspapers and he started giving readings. The book was nominated in February 1993 for the AKO Literatuurprijs. In 1995 he published the book Gracchanten, a 616-page book set in classical antiquity about the Gracchi brothers. He told about the book in the Radio 5 programm Ophef en Vertier.
