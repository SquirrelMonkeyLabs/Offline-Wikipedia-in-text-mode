 "text": "David James Arquette (born September 8, 1971) is an American actor, movie director, and producer. He was born in Winchester, Virginia to actor Lewis Arquette (1935-2001) and poet Mardi (n√©e Nowak, died 1997). He is best known for his role as Deputy Sheriff Dewey Riley in the Scream movies. Arquette played a wrestling fan in the movie Ready to Rumble. To market this movie, WCW hired Arquette to appear on their TV show and win their world title. Arquette argued he should not win the belt because he is not a real wrestler but WCW talked him into it. The attention received was only negative and the backlash eventually caused WCW to go out of business. The movie was also a critical disaster that ruined the careers of some of the actors in it, like Oliver Platt. Because Arquette is also a wrestling fan in real life, he regretted making a mockery of wrestling and donated the money he made from WCW to families of dead wrestlers Owen Hart and Brian Pillman and also to Darren Drozdov, who was paralyzed in a wrestling match.The Death of WCW pg. 258 Arquette was a contestant on the 13th season of Dancing with the Stars in fall 2011. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Virginia Category:Actors from Los Angeles Category:Movie directors from Los Angeles Category:American movie actors Category:American movie directors Category:American movie producers Category:American television actors Category:American television directors Category:American television producers Category:American voice actors Category:Jewish American actors Category:American wrestlers Category:Arquette family Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:Sportspeople from Virginia",
