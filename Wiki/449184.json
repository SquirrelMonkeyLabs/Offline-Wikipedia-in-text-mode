This repeated their performance from the 1984 tournament. In the men's tournament, the Soviet Union took home their second gold medal in the team's history for this event. Yugoslavia won the silver medal. The USA won the bronze medal.David Blevins, The Sports Hall of Fame Encyclopedia: Baseball, Basketball, Football, Hockey, Soccer (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2012), p. 975 This was the last Olympic basketball tournament where NBA players were not allowed to participate. Professionals from other leagues were allowed to compete. But players from other leagues were still considered amateurs. These were also the last Olympic basketball tournaments where the Soviets fielded a team. This was because the Soviet Union broke up prior to the 1992 Games. The United States was a major favorite to win. == References == Category:1988 Summer Olympics",
