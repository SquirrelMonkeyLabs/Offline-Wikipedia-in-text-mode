 "text": "Hermes is the messenger of the gods. He is the god of winter, travellers and shepherds in Greek mythology. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and is often shown with his caduceus. Hermes is the son of Zeus and Maia. He was born on Mount Cyllene. The story of his birth was told in the Homeric Hymn, which means Hymn to Hermes. It said that Maia was a nymph. Hermes was very clever and on his first day invented the lyre, by using the shell of a tortoise. He carries a golden sword. One of the myths about Hermes is that he once stole his brother's oxen, and burned them as a sacrifice. == Children == * Tyche was a daughter with Aphrodite. * Hermaphroditus was a son with Aphrodite. ==Related pages== * Hermeticism * Turms - Etruscan mythology version of Hermes * Mercury - Roman mythology version of Hermes ==Other websites== Category:Twelve Olympians",
