 "text": "\"Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu\" (; \"O God, of all Creation\") is the national anthem of Kenya. It was one of the first national anthems to be written especially to be a national anthem. It was written by the Kenyan Anthem Commission in 1963 after independence from the United Kingdom. They wanted the words to show the deepest beliefs and the highest hopes of the people of Kenya. ==Lyrics== Swahili original IPA transcription Literal English translation English lyrics I O God our strength Bring a blessing to us Justice be our shield and defender Let us have brotherhood Peace and freedom. Happiness we get and prosperity. II Awake, our brethren; Let's all work hard And let us give ourselves mightily Our country of Kenya That we love Let's be ready to defend it. III Let's build our nation Yes, that's our responsibility Kenya deserves respect Let's join hands Together at work Every day let us be grateful. I O God of all creation Bless this our land and nation Justice be our shield and defender May we dwell in unity Peace and liberty Plenty be found within our borders. II Let one and all arise With hearts both strong and true Service be our earnest endeavour And our homeland of Kenya Heritage and splendour Firm may we stand to defend. III Let all with one accord In common bond united Build this our nation together And the glory of Kenya The fruit of our labour Fill every heart with thanksgiving. ==References== Category:1963 works Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of Kenya",
