 "text": "On January 6, 1754, off the Malabar coast, three VOC ships—Wimmenum, Vrede, and Jacatra—fought the Angre clan's formidable Maratha fleet. The battle led to the explosion of the Wimmenum and the capture of many crew members, while a few escaped to Batavia and the Netherlands. The losses were extensively reported in Dutch, English, and French newspapers, prompting Batavia authorities to change shipping routes for VOC vessels south of Cochin. ==Background== The Angre family gained prominence in the late 17th century, especially under Kanhoji Angre, who expanded the Maratha Navy from the naval fortress of Vijaydurg. This expansion challenged European maritime dominance, particularly the Portuguese, who enforced the Cartaz system for exclusive shipping rights. As other European nations entered the region, competition for shipping passes increased. The Maratha Navy began issuing its own passes and seizing vessels, provoking resentment among established European powers. ==Battle== The battle lasted for 3 to 4 days, with Corporal Rood providing the most detailed account of how the ships were captured or destroyed. The barge Jacatra was taken first, suffering heavy losses for the Angres, who faced intense Dutch gunfire and were eventually forced to disembark. The Jacatra partially sank, as did the ship Vrede, which later exploded. Fighting continued throughout the 6th and into the morning of the 7th. According to Corporal Rood, the ship Wimmenum caught fire and exploded on the 7th, although other accounts suggest it exploded after 3 to 4 days. The fire was reportedly ignited by the sails of a 3-masted ship, possibly the EIC vessel Restoration, which the Angres had captured earlier. The captain chose to detonate Wimmenum later, despite some cannons still functioning at that time. Notably, Wimmenum remained afloat until at least March 12, when the Angre fleet departed. ===Review=== The battle lasted 3 to 4 days, with Corporal Rood detailing the capture and destruction of several ships. The barge Jacatra was taken first, suffering heavy losses from Dutch gunfire and partially sinking. Fighting continued into the morning of the 7th, when the ship Wimmenum caught fire and exploded, reportedly ignited by the sails of the captured EIC vessel Restoration. Despite still functioning cannons, the captain chose to detonate Wimmenum later. It remained afloat until at least March 12, when the Angre fleet departed. ==Result== The battle represented both a tactical and strategic triumph for the Angres. Tactically, they succeeded in sinking two large ships and decimating most of the crew. Strategically, their victory forced the authorities in Batavia to alter their shipping routes, effectively opening the entire Malabar coast to Angre control. Had it not been for the alliance formed between the English and the Peshwas in 1756, which ultimately dismantled Angre naval dominance, the Angre Navy might have solidified their gains and permanently captured forts along the Malabar coast. However, this did not signify the end of the Maratha Navy. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:India",
