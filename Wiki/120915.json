 "text": "Freedom of the press is a promise by a government not to punish journalists (and other people who report the news) for doing their job without censorship. It is an idea like freedom of speech: it lets people express their opinions or beliefs. Many countries have laws or constitutional amendments protecting freedom of the press. The word \"press\" in the phrase comes from the printing press. == Restrictions == Like with freedom of speech, freedom of the press does not protect everything that a journalist writes. A journalist can be sued for libel, which is publishing false and damaging claims about a person. Publishing copyrighted material is not legal in many countries. Writing about state secrets, like military plans, weapon designs, or other classified information is almost always illegal. == Related pages == * Internet censorship Category:Journalism Category:Freedom",
