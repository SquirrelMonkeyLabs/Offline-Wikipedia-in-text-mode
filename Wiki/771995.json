He is also mentioned in many other chronicles. == What we know about him == We do not know a lot about him. Perhaps he caused the wkrzanie uprising in Germany. He centralized the country a lot, beacause before baptism of Poland, this country was quite centralized as a Pagan country. He probably also conquered Goplans and Mazovians. == Sources == http://www.staropolska.pl/ang/middleages/Sec_prose/Gall.php3 Category:963 deaths Category:890s births Category:Kings of Poland Category:Piast dynasty Category:Polish dukes",
