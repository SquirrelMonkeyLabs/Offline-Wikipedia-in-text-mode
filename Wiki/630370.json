 "text": "In Ancient Roman religion, a flamen was one of fifteen priests assigned to major deities with state recognized cults during the Roman Republic. The most important of these were the three flamines maiores (\"major priests\"). They served as chief priests of the deities apart of the Archaic Triad. The other twelve were known as the flamines minores (\"lesser priests\"). All fifteen flamens were part of the College of Pontiffs, responsible for administering state-sponsored religion.Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil iv.262; Cicero Brutus 57. The three flamines maiores were the flamen Dialis, the flamen Martialis, and the flamen Quirinalis, who served Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus or Romulus. , Encyclop√¶dia Britannica ==References== Category:Religion in ancient Rome",
