 "text": "\"Coming Up You\" is a 1987 song by The Cars, appearing on their sixth studio album Door to Door. It was written by Ric Ocasek and sung by Benjamin Orr. ==Release== \"Coming Up You\" was first released as the eighth track on Door to Door in August 1987. The song later saw a single release in the US and Australia, backed by the Door to Door track \"Double Trouble.\" The third single from Door to Door (after the top twenty hit \"You Are the Girl\" and its less successful follow-up \"Strap Me In,\"), the song peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 (a slight improvement from the performance of \"Strap Me In\") and number 37 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. Unlike its predecessors, however, it failed to chart at all on the Mainstream Rock chart. The single was the last Cars single released before the band broke up in 1988 (although it was followed by \"Sad Song\" when the band reunited in 2011.) ==Reception== AllMusic critic Mike DeGagne called the track the \"most melodious tune [on Door to Door]\" and went on to say it \"was easily one of The Cars most distinct efforts since it doesn’t quite carry the same new wave/pop rock structure as the rest of their material yet relinquishes the same type of Cars charm.\" DeGagne continued, \"'Coming Up You' is one of [the] bright spots in an otherwise faltering release as fans were still comparing Door To Door to the success of 1984's Heartbeat City album. After all of the tracks are heard on Door To Door, 'Coming Up You' easily rises above the rest of the album’s lackluster fair, mainly because [Ben] Orr seems to sound more enthused and more interested than [Ric] Ocasek does on any of his songs.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:The Cars songs Category:1987 songs",
