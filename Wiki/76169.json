 "text": "The Socialist Reich Party of Germany (German: Sozialistische Reichspartei Deutschlands) was a political party in West Germany. It was formed in 1949. It was openly Neo-Nazi and admired Hitler. It split from the German Empire Party. Leaders included Otto Ernst Remer, a former Major General, and Fritz Dorls. The SRP claimed West Germany's first Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer was a crony or puppet leader who was beholden to the United States, and that Karl DÃ¶nitz (who Hitler named as his successor in 1945) had been the last legally legitimate leader of Germany. The SRP also falsely maintained that the Holocaust never happened, and for example, spread disinformation that the ovens used to cremate the murdered victims in the Dachau concentration camp were in fact built by United States military authorities after occupying Germany in 1945. The SRP wanted Europe to be dominated by a reunited Germany, a restored Reich that would neither be capitalist like West Germany or communist like East Germany. The SRP never openly criticized the Soviet Union,Martin Lee, The Beast Reawakens (Warner Books, 1998), p. 58. and it is likely because the Soviets secretly funded the party to discredit and destabilize West Germany and its US allies. The SRP had its own paramilitary organization, the Reichsfront. The SRP had about ten thousand members and, in 1952, won 16 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag election, and 8 seats in Bremen. It was banned in 1952 by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, the only court in West Germnay with the power to do so. ==Notes== == Other websites == * Germany's New Nazis 1951 pamphlet about the SRP and other neo-- nazi groups Category:Former political parties in Germany Category:Neo-Nazism Category:West Germany Category:1949 establishments in Germany Category:1950s disestablishments in Germany",
