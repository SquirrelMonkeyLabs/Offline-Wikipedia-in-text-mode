 "text": "David Arthur Allen (29 October 1935 â€“ 25 May 2014) was an English cricketer. He played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire between 1953 and 1972. He also played 39 Test matches for England. He was born in Horfield, Bristol, England. An accurate offspinner, David Allen had trouble maintaining a steady place in the England teams of the 1960s, with competition from Titmus, Mortimore, and Illingworth. He bowled off no more than four or five paces, with a deceptively casual action. He could be unplayable on helpful wickets, but he mastered the art of bowling tightly on good wickets as well. He was first picked for England in 1959, but was unable to play through injury. When he did play, his 39 Tests included tours to all the current Test-playing nations. A useful bat, with a first class hundred to his credit, he thrived on adversity, memorably so when playing out Hall's final over of the 1963 Lord's test. He took 882 wickets for Gloucestershire in a career that spanned 19 years. ==References== Category:1935 births Category:2014 deaths Category:English and Welsh cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Bristol",
