 "text": "Timoshenko beam theory, named after the Ukrainian-American engineer Stephen Timoshenko, is a classical engineering theory that describes the behavior of beams. It is an extension of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, which assumes that the cross-sections of the beam remain perpendicular to the axis of deformation during bending. Timoshenko beam theory, on the other hand, takes into account the effects of shear deformation and rotational inertia. Category:Elasticity (physics) Category:Equations Category:Engineering",
