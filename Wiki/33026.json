 "text": "A stone fruit, also called a drupe, is a fruit with a large \"stone\" inside. The stone is sometimes called the seed, but that is a mistake, as the seed is inside the stone. The stones can also be called a pit. These fruits are edible and used frequently in cooking. == Identification == === What makes a fruit? === A fruit is the matured ovary of a flower. Fruits consist of two main parts: the pericarp, or ovary wall, and the seed(s). The pericarp has three layers: the exocarp (skin/rind), the mesocarp (bulk of the pericarp), and the endocarp (innermost layer). === Berries vs. drupes === The two main classes of fleshy fruits are berries and drupes, or stone fruits. Berries have a fleshy mesocarp and endocarp, and may have multiple seeds. Drupes have a fleshy mesocarp, but a tough endocarp, and of course, a \"stone\" or \"pit\" at its center. Drupes typically have only a single seed. == Examples of stone fruits == Stone Fruits Scientific name Description What's the pit?
