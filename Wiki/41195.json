 "text": "Ming Kipa is a Nepalese Sherpa girl who (as recorded in the 2009 Guinness Book of Records) was the youngest person to climb Mount Everest until 2010. She reached the summit on May 24, 2003 when she was 15 years old, with her brother Mingma Gyula and her sister Laphka. Nepalese law does not allow climbers under 16 to climb Everest, so Ming Kipa climbed from the Chinese side. In 2010, her record was broken by 13-year old Jordan Romero. ==References== Category:Sherpa Kipa, Ming Category:1987 births Category:Living people",
