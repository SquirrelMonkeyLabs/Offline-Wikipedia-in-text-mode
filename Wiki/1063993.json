 "text": "Radiation damage is the effect of radiation on non-living things, such as buildings. Sometimes, radiation can have a positive effect on these materials, but sometimes, radiation damages them. Ionizing radiation can strip electrons from bonds, changing materials a lot. For example, metals are made stronger and harder by radiation, but they become less ductile. ==Effects== Radiation can have many different effects on a material, ranging from mild alteration to massive changes in a material's structure. These effects include:. * Material radioactivity as a result of exposure. * Radiolysis (the breaking of chemical bonds) resulting in weakening of the material. * Formation of reactive compounds. * Nuclear transmutation of elements within a material. * Introduction of impurities or defects via ion implantation (the process of launching ions at a material to change its properties), modifying the material's electrical functionality. Radiation damage effects can also be grouped by what material they're effecting. === Effects on metals and concrete === Radiation can have harmful effects on metals and concrete, because it can damage them until they are no longer safe to be used. In metals, exposure to radiation can make them stronger through hardening, it can also make the metals more brittle (making it easily fractured, broken, or cracked). Concrete is often used in nuclear power plants, meaning it is an area of frequently studied (in relation to radiation damage). Over time, certain aggregates (types of gravel, sand, and crushed stone added to materials) can swell due to radiation exposure, making it unsafe. === Effects on polymers === Radiation can effect polymers that are found in a variety of places, including nuclear reactors, medical apparatus, and aerospace parts. Ionizing radiation can be used to strengthen and change the traits of these polymers. === Effects on gasses === Exposure to radiation causes chemical changes in gasses. Gasses lack a strong structure, meaning most often the effects on them are chemical. There are also often large amounts of ozone produced during nuclear reactions. During nuclear reactions and events, such as criticality events, the ionizing radiation in the air can often react with the area around it, producing a bright blue glow. === Effects on liquids === Like gases, liquids do not have a strong structure. Instead, chemical bonds are broken within the liquids, altering their chemical composition. The effects of radiation on liquids, as a result, are generally limited to radiolysis.
