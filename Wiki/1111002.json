 "text": "Cicada 3301 is an internet mystery made by a group of anonymous people who are known as \"3301\". Cicada 3301 is a set of three different puzzles from 2012, 2013, and 2014. The first was posted by an anonymous user on 4chan, on January 4, 2012. Exactly a year later, the second puzzle was posted, and another year later, another puzzle. According to the group, the group was looking for \"highly intelligent individuals\". After these three puzzles, Cicada 3301 would no longer make any more puzzles, but was still active until 2017, when they posted an OpenPGP-signed message to \"beware false paths\". In 2021, a movie was made. It was inspired by Cicada 3301. == References == Category:Puzzles",
