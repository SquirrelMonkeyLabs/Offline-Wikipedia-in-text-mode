The developers are often not paid for this extra work. Crunch often leads to negative health impacts for game developers. It can also cause a decrease in the quality of their work. Critics of crunch complain about how it has become normal in the gaming industry.. A lack of unionization of game developers has often been said to be the reason crunch exists. Organizations such as Game Workers Unite try to end the crunch by making the companies that make games to follow labor rights. ==References== Category:Video games",
