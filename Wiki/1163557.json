 "text": "The black-flanked poison frog (Allobates granti) is a frog. It lives in French Guiana and Suriname. Scientists think it could live in Brazil too. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives in forests. It does not have to live near water. Scientists saw the frog between 100 and 730 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in one protected place: Parc Amazonien de Guyane. ==Young== Male frogs sit on the dead leaves on the ground and call to the female frogs. Male frogs fight each other for good places. The female can lay eggs all year. Scientists saw one group of eggs with nine eggs in it. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. People go into Parc Amazonien de Guyane to dig for gold, even though this is against the law. That can hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
