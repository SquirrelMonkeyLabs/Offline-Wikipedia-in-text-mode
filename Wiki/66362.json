 "text": "Ilocos Region is a region in the Philippines. Its regional center is San Fernando, La Union. The region has four provinces: Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union and Pangasinan. Inhabitants are called Ilocanos and they speak the Ilocano language. The term Ilocos Region is derived from this term. However, the designation of Ilocos as the basis of the name of the region promotes the wrong notion that all the residents of Region 1 are Ilocanos. Because 28% of the inhabitants are Pangasinan people, who belong to a different ethno- linguistic group from the Ilocanos. Pangasinan was moved from Central Luzon (Region III) to the Ilocos Region on June 22, 1973. == References ==",
