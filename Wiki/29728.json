 "text": "Tulsidas (1497-1623) was an Indian writer whose full name was goswami tulsidas . He wrote many books which are manifestations of Sanatan dharma and Indian ideology. His most famous book is the Ramcharitmanas. This book was written in a language called Awadhi, a dialect of Hindi. The book tells the story of Lord Rama and his war and victory over Ravan, the king of Lanka. Rama fought for his wife Sita and brought her back from Lanka to Ayodhya. Another book written by Tulsidas is Kavitavali. Tulsidas was born in Sukarketh Rajapur,Present-day in Uttar Pradesh, in Samvat 1554 or 1497 A.D. He was a Sarayuparina Brahmin by birth and is regarded as an incarnation of Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana. His father's name was Atmaram Dubey and his mother's name Hulsi. Tulsidas conceived of god in the form of Rama. Tulsidas's composition 'Ramcharitmanas.' written in Awadhi is important both as an expression of his devotion and as a literary work. His devotion to the literary world is very important. He founded the Sankatmochan Temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman in Varanasi. There is a belief that Tulsidas was the reincarnation of the sage Valmiki, who wrote the original “Ramayana.” Although Tulsidas wrote many popular works, he shared very little about his own life in his writings. Most of what we know about Tulsidas comes from the “Bhaktamal,” written by his contemporary Nabhadas, and the “Bhaktirasbodhini,” a commentary on the “Bhaktamal” by Priyadas. Tulsidas ka jivan parichay is rich with his devotion to Lord Rama and his contributions to literature. The poems and verses, known as Tulsidas ke dohe, reflect his deep spiritual insights and continue to be cherished by readers.
