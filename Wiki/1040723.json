 "text": "Starting in March 2023, and getting worse starting in June, Canada has been affected by an ongoing series of wildfires. All 13 provinces and territories have been affected, with large fires in Alberta, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec. The 2023 wildfire season had seen the most land burned in Canada's recorded history, even more than the 1989, 1995, and 2014 fire seasons. It was also the biggest in recorded North American history, even more than the 2020 Western US wildfire season. ==References== Category:2023 in Canada Category:Fires in North America Category:2023 fires Category:Wildfires",
