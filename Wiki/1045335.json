 "text": "The Argentina women's national football team is the team that plays for Argentina in women's international football. They are called \"La Albiceleste,\" which means \"The White and Sky-Blues.\" In Argentina, women's football is not as popular as men's football. More people follow sports like field hockey and volleyball. Most of the women who played football in Argentina used to do it just for fun until 1991 when they started a women's football championship called the Campeonato de FÃºtbol Femenino. This was done to make women's football more popular in Argentina. When it comes to football matches between Argentina and Brazil, it's not the same as the men's matches. Brazil usually does better because they have a strong women's football league that has been around for a long time, while Argentina only started their professional women's league in 2019. == References == Category:South American women's national association football teams Category:Football in Argentina Category:National sports teams of Argentina",
