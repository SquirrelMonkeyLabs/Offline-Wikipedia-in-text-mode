 "text": "Mount Kintore is an inselberg in northwest South Australia. It is about above sea level. It is located about halfway between the remote communities of Amaá¹¯a and Watarru. The mountain is made up mostly of metamorphic beds of gneisses and quartzite, which are split with diorite dykes. The beds have been thrown into a series of simple folds. These can be clearly seen on the northern face of the mountain. The rock has been weathered into ridges, and heavy erosion can be seen along the folds. At the western end of the mountain, the gneiss is replaced by granite. Mount Kintore is part of the traditional country of the Pitjantjatjara people. An important rock hole is located about to the west, called Kunamata. ==References== Category:Mountains of South Australia",
