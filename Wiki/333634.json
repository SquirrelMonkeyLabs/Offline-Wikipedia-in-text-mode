 "text": "Sebastian (died c. 268) was a Christian saint and martyr. He is said to have been killed during the Roman emperor Diocletian's persecution of Christians. He is usually depicted in art and literature tied to a post or tree and shot with arrows. This is the most common artistic depiction of Sebastian. However, he was rescued and healed by Irene of Rome. He then criticized the emperor, and was clubbed to death. He is venerated in both the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox churches. == References == Category:256 births Category:288 deaths Category:LGBT Category:Christian saints",
