 "text": "The Chapa bug-eyed frog or Sapa bug-eyed frog (Theloderma bicolor) is a frog. It lives in northwestern Vietnam and southeastern and central China. People have seen it between 1400 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests with small trees and medium-sized trees. It also lives in rainforests with moss in them. People have also seen these frogs in places with karst rock in the ground, sitting on plants next to streams. People have seen this frog between 1200 and 2402 meters above sea level. This frog lays eggs in holes in trees that have water in them. She lays the eggs on the inside of the hole, higher than the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water and swim. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. But it is in some danger. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms, get wood to build with, and build dams to make electricity. Sometimes people go into the forest to catch frogs to sell as pets, but people also raise Theloderma bicolor at the IEBR and WAZA Amphibian and Reptile Breeding Station, so it is hard to tell if any one pet frog was caught in the forest or not. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
