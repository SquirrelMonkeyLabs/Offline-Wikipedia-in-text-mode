 "text": "Jeffrey Clay Erlanger (November 30, 1970 – June 10, 2007) was an American activist for disability rights. He is well known for his appearance on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood when he was 10 years old, talking about his electric wheelchair and why he used it. Erlanger's philosophy was summarized in a 2002 Wisconsin Public Television ad: \"It doesn't matter what I can't do — what matters is what I can do.\" Erlanger choked on some food, and was in a coma for several weeks before dying on Sunday, June 10, 2007 in Madison, aged 36. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in the United States Category:American activists Category:Fred Rogers Category:Writers from Madison, Wisconsin Category:Disability activists Category:American people with disabilities",
