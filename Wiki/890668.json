 "text": "Juntos por el Cambio (sometimes abbreviated as JxC) (English: Together for Change) was an Argentine political coalition created to participate in the 2019 Argentine national elections. It was the largest opposition political space in Argentina. The coalition competed in the 2019 presidential elections with the formula made up of the then president of the Nation, Mauricio Macri, who was seeking his re-election, and the Peronist senator, who had been head of the Kirchnerist bench in the Senate, Miguel Ángel Pichetto. Macri did not achieve re-election and the front was in second place, with 40.28% of the votes, behind the formula of the Frente de Todos, made up of Alberto Fernández and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, which prevailed in the first round with 48.24% of the votes. On 14 November 2021, the center-left coalition of Argentina's ruling Peronist party, Frente de Todos (Front for Everyone), lost its majority in Congress for the first time in almost 40 years in midterm legislative elections. The election victory of Juntos por el Cambio meant a tough final two years in office for President Alberto Fernández. Losing control of the Senate made it difficult for him to make key appointments, including to the judiciary. It also forced him to negotiate with the opposition every initiative he sends to the legislature. After Javier Milei's victory in the presidential runoff, the ARI Civic Coalition political party, led by Elisa Carrió, decided to leave the alliance. Subsequently, the Cambio Federal bloc made up of Miguel Ángel Pichetto, Margarita Stolbizer, Emilio Monzó, Ricardo López Murphy and representatives of the governors of Entre Ríos and Chubut, also broke with Juntos por el Cambio to join Juan Schiaretti's space in Congress with the bloc Hacemos Coalición Federal, leaving the coalition dissolved. ==References== Category:2015 establishments Category:2010s establishments in Argentina Category:Political parties in South America Category:Politics of Argentina",
