 "text": "Newgrounds is a website hosted in Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1995 by Tom Fulp, the site hosts a variety of animations, games, art and music from users worldwide. On April 6, 2000, the site became the first automated content-upload website on the internet, innovating with a voting and review system. == Portal system == On April 7, 2000, the portal system was introduced in order to let artists upload their work without requesting. The websites portal relies on a \"Blamming\" system. When an animation or game is uploaded, users can vote from 0 to 5 stars, and if they'd like, add a written review. If a submissions score is too low, the submission will be Blammed. This means it will not be able to be viewed anymore, other than the name and comments in the \"Obituaries\" section of the portal. Newly added submissions will need to get a certain number of votes before being able to write written reviews. Newgrounds was one of the most popular websites in the 2000s. Many people created and viewed Flash animations and games, and due to the large amount of free entertainment, many users were drawn to it. In 2009, the art portal was opened. Rather than a Blamming system, featured submissions are based on being scouted. Being scouted means an artist who has already been scouted thinks your art is good enough for you to be scouted. Scouted artists can be featured, and you must sort by unscouted artists to see unscouted artists. == Notable events == On April 20, 2021, the site experienced a major crash and outage due to the rhythm game Friday Night Funkin' being updated to include a level featuring the Tankmen, notable Newgrounds mascots. ==References== ==Related pages== *Adobe Flash Category:American entertainment websites Category:Browser-based game websites Category:Video game websites Category:Video sharing websites",
