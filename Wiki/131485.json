 "text": "The Book of Micah (Hebrew: ספר מיכה) is one of the books of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. Scholars believe it was written by Micah the prophet, about 700 years before Jesus was born. Dr Bruce Waltke, IVP New Bible Commentary p 822 Chapter 1 verse 5 says Micah was from Moresheth (a town in southern Judah). He lived during the reigns of Yehotam, Ahaz and Hezekiah, roughly 750–700 BC. During this time, after a long period of peace, Israel, Judah, and the other nations of the region were threatened by the Neo-Assyrian empire. Micah warns that there would be a military defeat as punishment for worshiping idols and treating poor people badly by the powerful. This happened to the kingdom of Israel (Samaria) in 721 and to the kingdom of Judah (Jerusalem) about 100 years later. The book contains three cycles of warning about punishment and promise of restoration. ==Quotes== The book of Micah is quoted by the New Testament writer Matthew in chapter 2, verses 5 and 6 *Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are one of the smallest towns in Judah, but out of you I will bring a ruler for Israel, whose family line goes back to ancient times. (chapter 5 verse 2, Good News version). Jesus quotes Micah chapter 7 verse 6, to say that families will be divided by His message: * A man’s enemies will be those of his own household. — Matthew chapter 10, verse 36 Modern preachers have often quoted Micah Chapter 6, verse 8 * He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?
