 "text": "Anubias is a genus of tropical plants in the family Araceae. Members of this genus are popular as aquarium plants. Because of the often shady places where the plants grow, the genus was named after the Egyptian god Anubis, the god of the afterlife. The genus was first described in 1857 by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, with A. afzelii as its type species. Besides A. afzelii, the genus has the following species: A. barteri, A. gigantea, A. gilletii, A. gracilis, A. hastifolia, A. heterophylla, and A. pynaertii. ==References==",
