 "text": "A bolt is a form of grooved fastener with an external helical male thread that engages the interior female thread of a nut. Bolts are closely related to and often confused with screws. A screw is different from a bolt because it does not take a nut, and its helical thread is used to penetrate (cut into) a softer material (such as wood). This distinction is not always clear, and screws are someimes regarded as bolts without a nut. == References == Category:Hardware (mechanical)",
