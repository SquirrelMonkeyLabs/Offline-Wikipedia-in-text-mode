On 23 October of that year, the Minister of Internal Affairs notified the Press that the Constitution would be amended to make this official. The Legislative Assembly then passed an Interpretation Bill to declare that the colony could be referred to as Rhodesia. The Bill received its third reading on 9 December 1964, and passed to the Governor for assent. On 11 November 1965, following a brief but solemn consensus, Rhodesia's leading statesmen issued their country's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). This was immediately denounced as an \"act of rebellion against the Crown\" in the United Kingdom, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson promised that the illegal action would be short-lived. Initially, the state retained its pledged loyalty to Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, recognizing her as Queen of Rhodesia. However, few seemed to initially realize that Rhodesia was no longer within the Commonwealth's direct sphere of influence and British rule was now a constitutional fiction; Salisbury remained virtually immune to credible metropolitan leverage. Portrait Monarch 1 Queen Elizabeth II The monarch's powers were the same as prior to the Unilateral Declaration of Independence. However they were de facto exercised by the Officer Administering the Government (Clifford Dupont) as the Queen's de jure representative. == Prime Minister of Zimbabwe == ; === Southern Rhodesia (1923–1970) === # Portrait Name (Birth–Death) Term of office Political Party 1 Sir Charles Coghlan † (1863–1927) 1 October 1923 28 August 1927 Rhodesia Party 2 Howard Unwin Moffat (1869–1951) 2 September 1927 5 July 1933 Rhodesia Party 3 George Mitchell (1867–1937) 5 July 1933 12 September 1933 Rhodesia Party 4 Viscount Godfrey Huggins (1883–1971) 12 September 1933 7 September 1953 United Party 5 Sir Garfield Todd (1908–2002) 7 September 1953 17 February 1958 United Rhodesia Party 6 Sir Edgar Whitehead (1905–1971) 17 February 1958 17 December 1962 United Federal Party 7 Winston Field (1904–1969) 17 December 1962 13 April 1964 Rhodesian Front 8 Ian Smith (1919–2007) 13 April 1964 1 June 1979 Rhodesian Front ; Notes * † Died in office Portrait Name Took office Left office Political party 1 Abel Muzorewa 1 June 1979 18 April 1980 United African National Council 1 Robert Mugabe 18 April 1980 31 December 1987 ZANU Post abolished (31 December 1987 – 11 February 2009) 2 Morgan Tsvangirai 11 February 2009 11 September 2013 MDC–T Post abolished (11 September 2013) == List == Portrait Name Term of office Political Party Took office Left office Sir John Chancellor 1923 1928 Sir Murray Bisset 1928 1928 Sir Cecil Hunter- Rodwell 1928 1934 Fraser Russell 1934 1935 Sir Herbert Stanley 1935 1942 Fraser Russell 1942 1942 Sir Evelyn Baring 1942 1944 Sir Robert James Hudson 1944 1945 Sir Campbell Tait 1945 1946 Sir Fraser Russell 1946 1946 Sir Robert James Hudson 1946 1947 Sir John Noble Kennedy 1947 1953 Sir Robert Clarkson Tredgold 1953 1954 Sir Peveril William-Powlett 1954 1959 Sir Humphrey Gibbs 1959 1969 Michael Carver (24 June 1969 – 11 December 1979) The Lord Llewellin 1953 1957† Sir Robert Clarkson Tredgold 1957 1957 Sir William Lindsay Murphy 1957 1957 The Earl of Dalhousie 1957 1963 Sir Humphrey Gibbs 1963 11 November 1965 Picture Name (Birth–Death) Term in office Officer Administering the Government (1965–1970) Clifford Dupont (1905–1978) 11 November 1965 2 March 1970 Rhodesian Front Presidents of the Republic of Rhodesia (1970–1979) Clifford Dupont (1905–1978) 16 April 1970 Acting since 2 March 1970 31 December 1975 Rhodesian Front Henry Everard (1897–1980) (Acting) 31 December 1975 14 January 1976 Rhodesian Front John Wrathall † (1913–1978) 14 January 1976 31 August 1978 Rhodesian Front Henry Everard (1897–1980) (Acting) 31 August 1978 1 November 1978 Rhodesian Front Jack William Pithey (1903–1987) (Acting) 1 November 1978 5 March 1979 Rhodesian Front Henry Everard (1897–1980) (Acting) 5 March 1979 1 June 1979 Rhodesian Front President of the Republic of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia (1979) Josiah Zion Gumede (1919–1989) 1 June 1979 12 December 1979 Independent The Lord Soames 1979 1980 Position abolished Canaan Banana 18 April 1980 31 December 1987 ZANU Robert Mugabe 31 December 1987 21 November 2017 ZANU–PF Phelekezela Mphoko 21 November 2017 24 November 2017 Independent Emmerson Mnangagwa 24 November 2017 Incumbent ZANU–PF == References == Zimbabwe Zimbabwe *",
