 "text": "Pikmin 2 is a real-time strategy video game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It is the sequel to Pikmin. The plot involves Captain Olimar and his co-worker Louie going back to the planet from Pikmin to find treasure to save his boss' company. Olimar and Louie control a group of Pikmin and give them commands, which include collecting objects, fighting enemies, and reaching near places. ==Plot== ===Setting=== Captain Olimar, the star of the series, and Louie, his coworker, have to go back to the planet from Pikmin when the President of their company made them go there to find treasure to get the company out of debt. They meet with the Pikmin that Olimar met in the first game, along with 2 new types, and they join forces to find the treasure, trying to battle through monsters and the environment. ===Summary=== During the events of Pikmin 1, Captain Olimar's coworker Louie is sent to deliver a load of gold carrots worth over 10,000 \"Pokos\", the planet's currency. He returns without the carrots, claiming he was attacked by a \"Space Bunny\" who stole his carrots. As Captain Olimar is returning, the company president reveals to Captain Olimar that the company now has 10,100 \"Pokos\" of debt to repay, as a result of the carrots being destroyed, and his ship is repossessed. Olimar shows three president and Louie a Bottle cap from PNF-404, the planet he was on. The cap is scanned by a rocket ship, revealing it's worth 100 \"Pokos\", and is worth more than a year's salary. The president sends Olimar and Louie back to the planet to find more items to sell to repay the debt. They must find 10,000 \"Pokos\" worth of treasure to leave the planet. The game explores four locations across the first game's planet, based on the four seasons. The levels have many objects from the real world, like a Duracell battery and an RC Cola pop cap. A level in Super Smash Bros. Brawl is based on this planet. ==Gameplay== The gameplay is mostly the same as Pikmin's. Players control Olimar, Louie, and Pikmin. They can use them to pick up objects, reach other areas, and fight enemies. Pikmin are plucked out of the ground, and they live in a nest called an onion when they are not deployed. There can be up to 100 different Pikmin out of the onion, and there are five kinds of Pikmin - the Red Pikmin, which are stronger and fireproof, Yellow Pikmin, lighter and immune to electricity, Blue Pikmin, which are immune to drowning, Purple Pikmin, stronger than Red Pikmin and can lift heavy objects, and White Pikmin, immune to poison, poison if eaten, and have X-ray vision, allowing them to see buried objects. The Pikmin can be thrown into the air to reach a higher place and can be guided to get them all in one spot via a whistle. One new feature Pikmin 2 adds is the ability to switch between two leaders - Olimar and Louie. A new feature is the Underground, where Olimar, Louie, and their Pikmin go into a cave, which has treasures and powerful creatures, which serve as bosses, in it. The player has to get all the way to the bottom before he or she can get out. Unlike the first game, this game lacks the 30 day time limit. ==Music== Music from Pikmin 2, including the song \"Tane no Uta\", was used in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. ==Reception== Pikmin 2 got great reviews, and rates much higher than the original Pikmin. Many reviewers were glad that Nintendo got rid of the 30-day time limit from Pikmin, as well as the treasures based on real-life objects. Reviewers were split into the Underground areas, some liking the challenge, while others said it's boring or too hard. ==References== Category:2004 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo GameCube games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Pikmin Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii games",
