 "text": "The Book of Ezekiel, Hebrew: ספר יחזקאל , is a book of the Hebrew Bible and of the Old Testament. It is named after the prophet Ezekiel. It belongs to the Nevi'im (Prophets) and consists of 48 chapters. The book begins with a vision of beings with 4 heads surrounded by rings adorned with eyes. Then, God appears to Ezekiel and instructed him to warn the Israelites who at the time, were religiously rebellious. Another well known dream that the prophet saw was a valley full of dry bones that came to life when the prophet spoke to them. This was to show that God would bring life back to the people who were being punished by being taken captive by Babylon These two stories have been made into songs. The prophet did some strange things to warn the people that they were going to be punished for a time because they had not been faithful to God as he had told them to. It deals among others with the revival of the Jewish people and the Land of Israel (chapters 36-37), with the war of Gog and Magog against Israel (chapters 38-39), the new Jewish temple (chapters 40-47), and the determination of the boundaries of the land and also the division of the land among the tribes of Israel (chapters 47-48). == References == Category:Books of the Hebrew Bible Category:Old Testament books Book of Ezekiel Category:6th-century BC books",
