It has a mass higher than Earth's, but much less than the Solar System's ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, which are 15 and 17 times Earth's mass, respectively. The term \"super-Earth\" refers only to the mass of the planet, and does not imply anything about the surface conditions or habitability. == References == Category:Exoplanets Category:Types of planet",
