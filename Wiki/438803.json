 "text": "Michael Brett Adkisson (March 2, 1964 â€” April 12, 1987) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known under the ring name Mike Von Erich. He was a member of the famous Von Erich family. His father was Fritz Von Erich, a wrestling promoter and professional wrestler. Mike made his professional wrestling debut on November 24, 1983. Unlike his older brothers, however, he never wanted to do wrestling (according to certain wrestlers tied to Mike, including his brother Kevin). In 1985, Von Erich was diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome (rare among men). The condition caused brain damage that then affected his behavior and overall performing abilities. In April 1987, he was arrested for drunk driving and drug charges. A few days later, Mike wrote and left a suicide note for his family, went to Lake Dallas and overdosed on Placidyl and alcohol. His body was found four days later. ==References== ==Other websites== *The Von Erichs on WWE.com Category:1964 births Category:1987 deaths Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Drug- related suicides in the United States Category:Sportspeople from Dallas Category:Sportspeople who committed suicide Category:WWE Hall of Fame",
