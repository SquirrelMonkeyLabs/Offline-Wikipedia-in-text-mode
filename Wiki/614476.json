 "text": "Lincoln Square, located on the North Side of the city of Chicago, Illinois, is one of 77 well-defined Chicago community areas. The city's largest cemetery, Rosehill Cemetery, is located here. Greater Lincoln Square is made up of the smaller neighborhoods of Ravenswood Gardens, Bowmanville, Budlong Woods and Lincoln Square (neighborhood). Although it is sometimes known by these other names the City of Chicago officially designated it as Lincoln Square in 1925. According to the Encyclopedia of Chicago, the neighborhood make-up of Ravenswood and Lincoln Square is a common mistake â€” the two are not different. The boundaries of the original Ravenswood subdivision, drawn in 1869, were Montrose, Lawrence, Clark and Damen. ==References== Category:Community areas of Chicago",
