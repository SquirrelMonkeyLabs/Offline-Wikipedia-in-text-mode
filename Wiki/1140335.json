 "text": "Sonic X Shadow Generations is a 3D platform game in the Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise and a re-release of Sonic Generations (2011). The game is developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega, the same as many previous Sonic titles. The game prominently features Shadow the Hedgehog in his own new side- story. ==Gameplay== The Sonic Generations mode in this game is exactly the same as the original. The new side-mode Shadow Generations, however, makes several changes; Shadow has a completely new set of levels to go through from various Sonic titles released before and after the original, as well as a DLC pack with a level set in Tokyo based on the movie Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Shadow Generations includes a hub-world, which works the same way as the open-word gameplay from Sonic Frontiers. Shadow also has new abilities called Doom Powers, which are sometimes necessary to progress in a level. ==References== Category:2024 video games Category:3D platformers Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Open-world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Sega video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog games Category:Video game remasters Category:Video games about time travel Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games Category:Windows games",
