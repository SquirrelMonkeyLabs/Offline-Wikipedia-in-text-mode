 "text": "Omics is a term used in modern genetics. It is used for terms which end in the suffix -omics, such as genomics. The suffix -ome is used for the objects of study, such as the genome, proteome or metabolome. The -ome refers to a totality of some sort. Functional genomics aims at identifying the functions of as many genes as possible of a given organism. Holtorf, Hauke; Guitton, Marie-Christine; Reski, Ralf 2002. Plant functional genomics. Naturwissenschaften. 89 (6): 235â€“249. Bibcode:2002NW.....89..235H. doi:10.1007/s00114-002-0321-3. PMID 12146788. S2CID 7768096. Many \"omes\" beyond the original \"genome\" have been adopted by research scientists. \"Proteomics\" has become well-established as a term for studying proteins at a large scale.\"O M E S Page\". bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu. == References == Category:Genetics",
