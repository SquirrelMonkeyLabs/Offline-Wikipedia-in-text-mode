 "text": "Energy security is the association between national security and the availability of natural resources for energy consumption. Accessing to (relatively) cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. International energy relations have contributed to the globalization of the world leading to energy security and energy vulnerability at the same time. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources including nuclear energy result in significant energy security and economic benefits. == Reference == ==Other websites== *Journal of Energy Security *Institute for the Analysis of Global Security: Energy Security Research *United States Energy Security Council *Energy and Environmental Security Initiative (EESI) *NATO and Energy Security Category:Energy Category:National security",
