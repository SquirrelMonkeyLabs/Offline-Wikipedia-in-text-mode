 "text": "Allobates grillisimilis is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is 13.9 ± 0.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult frog is 14.4 ± 0.8 mm long. The male and female frogs are the same color. The skin of the frog's back is tan-brown in color with darker brown on the sides of the body. Some frogs have spots on their backs. The male frog's vocal sac looks white or clear when he uses it to call, and it can have brown marks on it. Most frogs have stripes on the sides of their bodies. The tops of the front legs are brown in color and white where they meet the body. The bottoms of the front legs are white or clear in color. The back legs are dark brown in color with white marks near the rear end. There are white scutes on the toes of all four feet. The iris of the eye is gold with black marks and a ring around the pupil. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that do not fill with water. The place where the frog lives has some protected parks in it, for example Floresta Nacional Pau-Rosa. ==Young== The male frog sits on branches or logs just over the ground and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on land, usually on dead leaves. She lays 6-13 eggs at a time. Scientists have seen the male frogs carrying tadpoles on their backs. The scientists think the male frogs carry the tadpoles to streams, where they will swim and grow. The tadpoles are partially see-through. A person can see the tubes for blood and the internal organs through the skin. Their bodies have small gold spots on them. The middle of the body can be red or pink in color. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
