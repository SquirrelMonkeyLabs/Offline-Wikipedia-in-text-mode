He sails on a whaling ship called the Pequod. Ahab is the captain of the ship. He wants to kill a white whale called Moby Dick. The whale bit his leg off. The book received mixed reviews. It did not sell very well during its author's lifetime. Moby-Dick is now thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written. Melville took 18 months to finish his book. He based it off of things he had seen while sailing, and also books on whaling he had read. It contains a lot of information on whale hunting, whale oil, and life aboard a whaling ship. It also explores social status, ideas about God, and revenge. The book was first published in London in October 1851. It was published in three volumes and was called The Whale. It was published In New York a month later in November and, was in one complete volume. It was called its current title, Moby-Dick, or, The Whale. == Summary == Ishmael travels from Manhattan to New Bedford, Massachusetts because he wants to sail on a whaling ship. He finds out that he cannot leave because there are no ferries from New Bedford to the island of Nantucket late at night. Ishmael stays at an inn. The inn has lots of people, so he has to share a bed with a cannibal named Queequeg. They become friends. The next day, Ishmael and Queequeg attend a religious sermon about Jonah. After, they head for Nantucket. Ishmael chooses the whale ship Pequod to sail on. The Pequod's captain is named Ahab. Ahab is described as moody and odd. A man named Elijah tells Ishmael and Queequeg that bad things will happen on the ship. The Pequod leaves the harbor on Christmas. Ishmael talks a lot about cetology throughout the novel. Some chapters talk only about whales and whaling, and not about characters. At the end of the novel, the Pequod sees Moby Dick. They chase him for three days. Ahab is killed when the rope of his harpoon ties around him and pulls him out of his boat. The rest of the men are killed when Moby Dick destroys their ship. Ishmael is the only one who survives. This is because a coffin lifebuoy comes to the surface of the ocean beside him. The coffin was made for Queequeg when he was sick, but he got better. Ishmael stays on the coffin until the boat the Rachel rescues him. == Characters == === Ishmael === Ishmael is the narrator of the novel. He is the only one to survive when the Pequod sinks.
