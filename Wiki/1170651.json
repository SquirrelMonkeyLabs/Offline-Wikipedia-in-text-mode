 "text": "Talim Island is a volcanic island in Laguna de Bay, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, situated within the boundaries of Rizal province. The island and the lake are both the largest of their kind in the country. The island's western side is part of the municipality of Binangonan, Rizal, while the eastern section is part of Cardona, Rizal. The island forms the southwest rim of the Laguna Caldera, which created the maars and volcanic craters of Talim Island. ==Geography== Talim Island is located almost at the center of Laguna de Bay, a three-lobed lake the center of which is the Laguna Caldera. The northernmost tip of the island is separated from the mainland by Diablo Pass, which is only about at the narrowest. The southernmost tip of the island is called Talim Point. The highest point of the island is Mount Tagapo, known locally as \"Bundok ng Susong Dalaga\" (Maiden's breast mountains) for the conical hill at its peak resembling a female breast. The hill is among several in the Tagalog region called as such because of its shape. ==Gallery== Image:Ph locator rizal binangonan.png|Binangonan portion Image:Ph locator rizal cardona.png|Cardona portion == References== ==Other websites== * Talim Island at OpenStreetMap *Philippine Standard Geographic Code *2000 Philippine Census Information Category:Rizal Category:Islands of Laguna de Bay",
