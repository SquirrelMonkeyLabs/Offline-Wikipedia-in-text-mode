 "text": "A chimta is a percussive instrument from Southeast Asia. The word \"chimta\" translates to \"tweezers\" or \"tongs\" in Punjabi. This is due to the fact that the chimta resembles and works similarly to cooking tongs. The chimta is made of two connected pieces of metal lined with small bells on the sides. == Sound == The chimta is played by clicking together the two pieces, causing the bells to make a high jingling sound. This is often used to keep a beat. == References == Category:Percussion instruments Category:Indian music",
