 "text": "General Epistles or “Epistles General” (called ‘’Catholic Epistles by Catholics”) are books in the New Testament in the form of letters. The letters attributed to Paul are not included. Paul's letters are named for the church or person addressed. The General Epistles are named for their author instead of the church or person to whom they were written. Most of the General Epistles are written to all Christians. The second Epistle of John was written to an unnamed “elect” lady and her children (vs.1)(the word “elect” is a reference to Tribulation Jews, Matt. 24:21-22) the Third Epistle of John was written to his friend and elder Gaius.
