 "text": "The Carolingian dynasty was a Frankish noble family that ruled over a large part of Western Europe from 751 to 987. The line of mayors, kings, and princes succeeded the Merovingian dynasty. The family's most famous member was Charlemagne. The dynasty was named after Charlemagne's grandfather, Charles Martel. As as a mayor of the palace of Austrasia and Neustria,Pierre Riche, The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe (Philadelphia : University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), pp. 36–37 he was the real power behind the throne. Charles Martel (meaning \"the hammer\") left his wealth and power to his two sons: Pepin III and Carloman. In 771 Carloman died, which left his half to Pepin, who became mayor of the palace.Einhard the Frank; Notker; Balbulus, Two Lives of Charlemagne, ed. Lewis G. M. Thorpe (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1983), pp. 56–58 When the last of the Merovingian kings, Childeric III, was deposed by the Pope in Rome, Pepin was made king of the Franks. Pope Stephen III traveled to France and placed the crown on his head.World Monarchies and Dynasties, ed: John Middleton (London; New York: Routledge, 2015), p. 150 Pepin left the kingdom to his two sons: Charles and Carloman. Charles and Carloman shared the kingdom for some time. Carloman then traveled to Rome and became a monk, and Charles became the sole king. He later earned his name \"Charles the Great\" (Charlemagne) by defeating the Lombards, the Saxons, and the Avars. In 800, Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III. The dynasty was passed down to his son, Louis the Pious, and to his grandsons. When Louis inherited the kingdom, the Carolingian Empire had already started to decline. By the end of the 9th century, it came to an end. With the collapse of the empire, the dynasty came to an end. == References == Category:Frankish rulers Category:Royal dynasties",
