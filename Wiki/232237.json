 "text": "State Farm Stadium is a sports venue in Glendale, Arizona. It opened in 2006 as Cardinals Stadium, named for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League, which have played there since the stadium opened. Shortly after opening, the stadium was renamed University of Phoenix Stadium. This name was due to a corporate sponsorship contract; the University of Phoenix is a for- profit school without a sports program. In 2018, the Cardinals and State Farm Insurance entered into a new sponsorship deal, leading to the stadium's current name. ==Structure== The stadium is completely covered, featuring a grass field that slides in and out of the stadium. This allows the playing surface to be exposed to sunlight when not in use, and also allows the stadium floor to be used for other events without risk of damaging the field. ==History== The stadium has hosted many events apart from Cardinals games. The Super Bowl was held there in 2008, 2015, and 2023. Several college football games, including the annual Fiesta Bowl, have been played there, as have some high school games. It has also hosted several significant soccer (association football) matches, including several matches in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup and Copa Am√©rica Centenario in 2016. The stadium also hosted WrestleMania XXVI, and hosted the Final Four (semifinals and finals) of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in 2017. It will host the Final Four again in 2024. == Other websites == *State Farm Stadium's Official Website ==References== Category:National Football League venues Category:Sports buildings in the United States Category:Sports in Glendale, Arizona Category:Buildings and structures in Arizona Category:Arizona Cardinals Category:2006 establishments in the United States Category:2000s establishments in Arizona",
