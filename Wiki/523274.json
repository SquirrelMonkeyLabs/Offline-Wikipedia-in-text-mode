In the perspective of the laws of the People's Republic of China, the Taiwan Independence movement is considered as secessionism, too because the PRC considers the Taiwan area as its integral part as a rogue province. == Related pages == *Free area of the Republic of China (Taiwan) *List of Chinese dissidents *Movies banned in China *Political problems of China == References== ==Other websites== * Category:Politics of China Category:National liberation movements",
