The Italians were nearly 10,000 and were concentrated in Misurata, Homs and some newly created villages Video of \"Villaggio Crispi\" for Italian colonists (Gioda, Crispi, Littoriano, Corradini, etc.) Most of the population was Muslim, but there was a growing community of Catholics due to the Italian colonists immigration. Additionally there were nearly one thousand Jews in Misurata.Jews in northwestern Italian Libya The province from 1939 was considered officially part of the Kingdom of Italy, with the same laws. It was one of the 4 new Italian provinces of the so-called Quarta Sponda (Fourth Shore) of Mussolini's Greater Italia.
