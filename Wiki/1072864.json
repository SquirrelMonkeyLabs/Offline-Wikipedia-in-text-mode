 "text": "The Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle was a proposed 125-floor skyscraper for Chicago, Illinois, United States. It was proposed by Lee Miglin and J. Paul Beitler's firm Miglin-Beitler Developments and designed by architect CÃ©sar Pelli. The site of the proposed Skyneedle is now a parking garage. If it had been built when it was planned, the tall Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle would have been the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion. The tower's plans were revealed in 1988. The plans ended following a bad economy after the Gulf War. Miglin-Beitler still wanted to build the project, but these plans ended with the murder of Lee Miglin in 1997. The tower would have risen 125 floors and 1,999 feet. It would have had 1.9 million square feet of space (with 1.2 million being office space). It was planned to cost $450 million to construct. ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in Chicago Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States",
