The 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot. The revised version of the film uses only 11 minutes and 7 seconds of the footage from the original The Game of Death (1972). ==Creation of special feature== But on 2019 producer Alan Canvan edited Game of Death Redux. The edit only uses footage shot during the original production of The Game of Death. The movie was released as a special feature in The Criterion Collection's Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films, on July 14, 2020. It was presented closely the way Bruce intended. While at the same time, keeping in- tact some of the stronger as aspects of the universally panned, pieced together 1978 movie (known to fans as Game of Death ’78), such as John Barry’s acclaimed score, as well some of the film’s strong audio design.Second version of Game of Death Redux in 2022 on cityonfire.com ==New Version on 2022== There is a second version of Game of Death Redux on 2022. With the first version Alan Canvan had concentrated entirely on the flow of the piece. But he was not satisfied to how the shots were cut and how the music drove the narrative artistically. Canvan wanted a complete visual and sound restoration. So he got help from a new team. After a year the new Redux has been fully restored with a brand-new color grade and audio mix. Additionally, Chris Kent, who looped Bruce’s war cries for Robert Clouse’s Game of Death movie, lent his voice once again to match the audio portions from 1978. Finally, reworking a dozen sequences resulted in a much more concise and dramatic presentation of the narrative. ==Legacy== Canvan’s Game of Death Redux was the latest project that focused on Bruce Lee’s original 1972 storyline, a subject that was previously explored in John Little’s 2000 documentary, Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey and Artport’s Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯 (released in Japan the same year), not to mention a series of fan edits that have been circulating the internet. All aforementioned edits use 1972-era The Game of Death footage that was initially discovered by Hong Kong film expert Bey Logan, who stumbled upon the footage in the now-defunct Golden Harvest studio vaults back in 1999. == The Game of Death == The Game of Death (死亡的遊戲) is an incompleteThe Tao of Gung Fu.
