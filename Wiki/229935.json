 "text": "The wet boxer-short contest is a beauty contest between men in their underwear. It is a lot like a wet t-shirt contest that shows women. However, unlike a wet T-shirt contest, the water used in a wet boxer-short contest is warm instead of cold. The contests are often considered degrading for women due to sexism; however, they are not considered degrading for men and are instead considered comical. Wet boxer contests are also held in gay bars. ==Notes== Category:Human sexuality Category:Competitions",
