He studied at the National Military College (Colegio Militar de la Nación). Videla married Alicia Raquel Hartridge in 1948. ==Presidency== Videla came to power in a coup d'état that deposed Isabel Martínez de Perón. After the return of a representative democratic government in 1983, he was prosecuted for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule. These included: * Kidnappings * \"Disappearances\" (where people would disappear and never come back; these people were murdered and their bodies were never found) * Torturing and murdering many people without a trial at secret concentration camps. These people included activists; people who Videla thought might take power from him; and their families * Stealing many babies who were born while their mothers were imprisoned in concentration camps ==Personal life== Videla remained married to his wife Alicia until his death in 2013. They had seven children. ===Arrest=== He was under house arrest until 10 October 2008, when he was sent to a military prison. On 22 December 2010, Videla was sentenced to life in a non-military prison for the deaths of 31 prisoners after his coup d'état. On 5 July 2012, Videla was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the systematic kidnapping of children during his tenure. ===Death=== Videla died in his sleep on 17 May 2013, at the Marcos Paz Prison in Buenos Aires. He died from complications after falling in the shower. He was 87. ==References== ==Other websites== *Ex-Argentine Dictator Sentenced to Life in Prison – video report by Democracy Now! *Former Dictator of Argentina Found Guilty Of Crimes Against Humanity Category:1925 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Argentine generals Category:Kidnappers Category:Politicians from Buenos Aires Category:People who died in prison custody Category:Presidents of Argentina Category:Former dictators Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Argentine criminals",
