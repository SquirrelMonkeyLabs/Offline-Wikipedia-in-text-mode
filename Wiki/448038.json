 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Aveyron department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Aveyron are: # Arrondissement of Millau, (subprefecture: Millau), with 97 communes. # Arrondissement of Rodez, (prefecture of the Aveyron department: Rodez), with 127 communes. # Arrondissement of Villefranche-de-Rouergue, (subprefecture: Villefranche-de- Rouergue), with 62 communes. ==History== Since its creation, the Aveyron department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the Aveyron department with nine districts: Mur-de-Barrez, Saint-Geniez-d'Olt, Sévérac-le-Château, Millau, Saint-Affrique, Sauveterre, Villefranche, Aubin, Rodez; the capital was Rodez * 1800 : creation of the arrondissements: Rodez, Espalion, Millau, Saint-Affrique, Villefranche-de-Rouergue * 1926 : the arrondissements of Espalion and Saint-Affrique are eliminated ==References== Aveyron",
