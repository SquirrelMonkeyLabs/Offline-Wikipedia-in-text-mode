 "text": "In Portugal, the civil governments (Portuguese: Governos Civis, singular Governo Civil) are the groups of public administration that represent the government at the district level. Each civil government is led by an administrative magistrate and the civil governor (Governador Civil). The administrative magistrate is a delegate of the central government. The civil governor is chosen by the Council of Ministers. The civil government operated under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Administration. The role of Civil Governments has become smaller since their creation in 1835. At first, they had many powers as representatives of the central government . They also made certiain that all State services within the district worked together. They now serve as a local delegations of the Ministry of Internal Administration. Their responsibilities inclue issuing passports, public safety, and elections. In 2011, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho ended all Civil Governments with Decree-Law No. 114/2011 of 30 November. That law gave all of the powers of the civil governments to other groups. These include the Municipal Chambers, the police, the National Republican Guard and the National Authority for Civil Protection). No civil governors have been appointed since this time but the post was created by the Constitution and still exists . Category:Government of Portugal",
