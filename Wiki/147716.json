The article was soon made into a book. It described how the bombing affected the lives of six individuals: *Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto: a Methodist minister educated in the United States at Emory University was 3,500 yards from the center of the explosion; *Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura: a war widow and seamstress, the mother of three young children was 1350 yards from the center of the explosion; *Dr. Masakazu Fujii: a prosperous doctor and owner of a private hospital was 1550 yards from the center of the explosion; *Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge (Makoto Takakura): a Jesuit priest stationed in the city was 1400 yards from the center of the explosion; *Dr. Terufumi Sasaki: a young doctor at the Red Cross hospital was 1650 yards from the center of the explosion; and *Miss Toshiko Sasaki (Sister Dominique Sasaki): A clerk at the East Asia Tin Works (no relation to Terufumi Sasaki) was 1600 yards from the center of the explosion. Each account is followed by a brief statement describing how close each person was to the center of the blast. ==Related pages== *Nuclear or Not? *Nuclear disasters Category:History books Category:Books about nuclear issues Category:Hiroshima Category:1940s books Category:1946 works",
