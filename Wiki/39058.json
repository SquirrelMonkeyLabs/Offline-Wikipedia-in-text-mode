 "text": "A small Solar System body (SSSB) is a term defined in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union to describe solar system objects which are not planets or dwarf planets: ::All other objects orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as \"Small Solar System Bodies\" ... These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies. Therefore, it refers to these objects that can be further grouped based on their orbit or what they are made of: * all known minor planets that are not dwarf planets, i.e. ** the classical asteroids (except the largest one, 1 Ceres); ** the Centaurs and Neptune Trojans; ** the smaller Trans-Neptunian Objects (except dwarf planets such as Pluto and Eris); * all comets; * It is not yet clear whether there will be a lower bound on the group of small solar system bodies, or if it will encompass all material down to the level of meteoroids. Some of the larger \"small Solar System bodies\" may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets, pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly-round shape). ==References== Category:Minor planets Category:Solar System",
