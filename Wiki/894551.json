His work regarding Roman history is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902 for being \"the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, A History of Rome\", after having been nominated by 18 members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He was also a prominent German politician and was a member of the Prussian and the German Parliaments.
