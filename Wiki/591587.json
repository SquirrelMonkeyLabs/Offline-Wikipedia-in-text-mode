 "text": "Gabrovo () is a city in central northern Bulgaria. It is the administrative centre of Gabrovo Province. ==History== People have lived in the area around Gabrovo since the Neolithic. It gained economic importance after Veliko Tarnovo became capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the 12th century. Craftsmanship and trade grew because Gabrovo was close to both the capital and the Balkan passes. In the 1870s Felix Kanitz said that Gabrovo is \"a big workshop\" and that it is a \"city that lives from the water,\" referring to widely used water power. The glory of the goods of Gabrovo became known throughout the Ottoman Empire, and beyond that, in Bucharest. There is still a street named \"Gabroveni\" in Bucharest. ==Twin towns – Sister cities== Gabrovo is twinned with: * Thun, Switzerland * Mytischi, Russia * Mogilev, Belarus * Kumanovo, Macedonia * Aalst, Belgium * Chernihiv, Ukraine * Mittweida, Germany * Panevėžys, Lithuania * Sisak, Croatia * Nowy Sącz, Poland * Preshov, Slovakia ==Other websites== * Gabrovo municipality's home page Category:Cities in Bulgaria",
