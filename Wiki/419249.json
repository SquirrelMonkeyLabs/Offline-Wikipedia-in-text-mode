 "text": "The Davy lamp is a safety lamp for use in mines. It was invented in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy.Brief History of the Miner's Flame Safety Lamp at minerslamps.net. Accesses 7 July 20121 It is a wick lamp with the flame enclosed inside a mesh screen. It was created for use in coal mines, where explosions happened in the presence of methane and other flammable gases. Those gases, called firedamyp or minedamp, did not ignite a shielded flame. The wire mesh put flames out. The lamp also warned the men of carbon dioxide or methane. The flame would burn higher, and with a blue tinge. Modern versions of the lamp are still used to test mine gases, but the light for working is now electric. == References == *Davy, Humphry 1816.
