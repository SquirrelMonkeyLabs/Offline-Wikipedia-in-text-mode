 "text": "The War of the Spanish Succession was fought from 1701 to 1714 over who would be the next king of Spain after Charles II had died childless. France wanted the new king to be Philip of Anjou, a grandson of its own king, Louis XIV, as Charles had stated in his will. However, Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and other states in Europe opposed that because they wanted to prevent France from becoming more powerful. The war was fought mostly in Europe, but there were battles also in the West Indies, South America and North America. In North America, the war is called Queen Anne's War since the queen of Great Britain was Queen Anne. The war ended by Philip of Anjou winning. Britain and its allies finally accepted him to become the next king of Spain, called Philip V, but he had to give up his right to the French throne. Also, Austria got most of Spanish Italy, and Britain got Spanish Menorca and Gibraltar.
