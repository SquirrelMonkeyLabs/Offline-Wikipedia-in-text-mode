 "text": "Auto Modellista () is an arcade racing video game, for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube. It was developed by Capcom Studio 1, and published by Capcom. == Description == Auto Modellista marked itself apart from others of the same genre genre, with cel-shaded graphics, which gave a hand-drawn and cartoon- like appearance. The gameplay was similiar to Gran Turismo, with the player picking a vehicle, then changing some costumized and race style type. There are six tracks, such as Suzuka Circuit, and the Mt. Akagi mountain pass. After poor initial reception, Capcom modified for the North America releases in 2003 called Auto Modellista: US Tuned (re-released Japanese version). This version featured American cars, like Dodge Viper, two new oval tracks, various UI improvements and a new handling model, that saw cars move slower and lose more speed turns. Also at the same year, Auto Modellista received a follow up in the group of Group S Challenge for the Xbox home console. And the game also included from other Capcom games, such as Mega Man Battle & Chase, a racing video game based on Mega Man series, in the Mega Man X Collection. ==Other websites== * CAPCOM - Auto Modellista (official site) * Category:2002 video games Category:Capcom games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo GameCube games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Xbox games",
