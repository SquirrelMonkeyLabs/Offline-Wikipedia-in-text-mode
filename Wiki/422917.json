In 1988, she received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Sir James Black, a British coworker.\"Gertrude B. Elion.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography, Gale, 1998. Student Resources in Context, link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/K1631002018/SUIC?u=palo88030&xid;=73ffdde5. Accessed 28 Mar. 2017. == Background == Elion was born in New York.

She worked as a lab assistant, food analyst, and high school teacher for several years. While Elion worked, she earned her Master's degree at night. In 1941, she earned her M.S. (Master’s in science) degree in chemistry from New York University. During World War II, the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Tuckahoe, New York hired Elion as a biochemist. In 1988, she and her colleague, George Herbert Hitchings, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. They both discovered and developed treatments for previously incurable diseases. Some of those diseases were leukemia and herpes. She became the senior research chemist. Later, she was promoted to the head of the Department of Experimental Therapy.\"Gertrude B.

She was named the \"Higuchi Memorial Award winner\". She lectured at the University of Kansas in 1995. She also received a “Master of Science” award in chemistry from New York University in 1941. Elion was hired as a biochemist during World War II. She focused on chemical compounds and nitrogenous bases. Elion also worked part time as a doctor in Brooklyn. She received an honorary doctorate, the highest medical degree, from George Washington University. Elion was also the first woman to be admitted into the National Inventor’s Hall of Fame. Elion graduated from Hunter College with a Bachelor of Art’s Degree in chemistry in 1937. == Dedication and death == Gertrude B. Elion held 45 patents.
