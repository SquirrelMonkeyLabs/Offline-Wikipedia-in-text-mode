 "text": "Ryan White (born March 17, 1988) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey center who previously played for the Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers, Arizona Coyotes and Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League (NHL). == Playing career == White spent four seasons, from 2004–05 to 2007–08, in the Western Hockey League with the Calgary Hitmen. He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the third round, 66th overall, in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. Following his WHL career, White was assigned to the Canadiens' minor league affiliate, the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL), where he recorded 29 points in 80 games as a rookie in 2008–09. White made his NHL debut in a call-up with the Montreal Canadiens on November 5, 2009 against the Boston Bruins, recording an assist. He was called up once again for a game against the Ottawa Senators the following month on December 8. White played the entirety of the first period before being pulled from the game after the NHL noticed he was playing, despite the Canadiens not having properly reported his call-up to the league before the 5 p.m. deadline. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 2004–05 Calgary Hitmen WHL 63 9 14 23 95 12 2 1 3 26 2005–06 Calgary Hitmen WHL 72 20 33 53 121 13 3 4 7 18 2006–07 Calgary Hitmen WHL 72 34 55 89 97 18 6 8 14 36 2007–08 Calgary Hitmen WHL 68 28 44 72 98 16 6 11 17 8 2008–09 Hamilton Bulldogs AHL 80 11 18 29 68 6 3 1 4 9 2009–10 Hamilton Bulldogs AHL 62 17 17 34 173 19 4 5 9 47 2009–10 Montreal Canadiens NHL 16 0 2 2 16 — — — — — 2010–11 Hamilton Bulldogs AHL 33 3 9 12 77 13 2 6 8 37 2010–11 Montreal Canadiens NHL 27 2 3 5 38 7 0 0 0 2 2011–12 Montreal Canadiens NHL 20 0 3 3 61 — — — — — 2011–12 Hamilton Bulldogs AHL 4 4 1 5 26 — — — — — 2012–13 Montreal Canadiens NHL 26 1 0 1 67 3 1 0 1 23 2013–14 Montreal Canadiens NHL 52 2 4 6 50 — — — — — 2014–15 Lehigh Valley Phantoms AHL 11 1 2 3 39 — — — — — 2014–15 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 34 6 6 12 30 — — — — — 2015–16 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 73 11 5 16 101 6 1 0 1 28 2016–17 Arizona Coyotes NHL 46 7 6 13 70 — — — — — 2016–17 Minnesota Wild NHL 19 2 1 3 14 3 0 0 0 4 2017–18 San Diego Gulls AHL 21 3 6 9 52 — — — — — 2017–18 Iowa Wild AHL 23 2 6 8 57 — — — — — 2018–19 Manitoba Moose AHL 27 5 2 7 57 — — — — — 2019–20 Manitoba Moose AHL 21 2 1 3 87 — — — — — 2020–21 Boissevain Border Kings THHL 1 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 2020–21 Wichita Thunder ECHL 25 4 5 9 82 2 1 0 1 0 NHL totals 313 31 30 61 447 19 2 0 2 57 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Arizona Coyotes players Category:Calgary Hitmen players Category:Canadian ice hockey centres Category:Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL) players Category:Ice hockey people from Brandon, Manitoba Category:Iowa Wild players Category:Lehigh Valley Phantoms players Category:Manitoba Moose players Category:Minnesota Wild players Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Philadelphia Flyers players Category:American Hockey League players",
