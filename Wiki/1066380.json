 "text": "The home of Jimmy Carter (1924–2024), who was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981, and his wife Rosalynn Carter (1927–2023) is at 209 Woodland Drive in Plains, Georgia, United States. It is the only house that the Carters owned. They had lived there from 1961 until their deaths. It is also the final resting place of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. ==House details== The Historic American Buildings Survey said the house is a \"modest 1960s ranch-style house\". A pond on the grounds was personally dug by Jimmy Carter; where he used it for fly fishing. A magnolia tree on the grounds was grown from a tree on the lawn of the White House that was planted by President Andrew Jackson. ==Carter burials== Jimmy Carter planned to be buried in the estate of the house by a willow tree on the lawn of the property. The home is part of Jimmy Carter National Historical Park but is not open to the public. The house will be turned into a National Park Service (NPS) museum and open it to the public after the couple's deaths. After her death in November 2023, Rosalynn was buried on the estate. Following his death in December 2024, Jimmy Carter was buried there after his state funeral. ==References== Category:Jimmy Carter",
