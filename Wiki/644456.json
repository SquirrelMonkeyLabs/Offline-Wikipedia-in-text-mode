 "text": "The eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) is a critically endangered species of the genus Gorilla and the largest living primate. The species is subdivided into two subspecies. Grauer's gorilla, formerly known as the eastern lowland gorilla (G. b. graueri) is more populous, at about 3,800.: \"The Eastern Lowland Gorilla population in the DRC has plummeted dramatically over the last 10 years, with probably only about 5,000 of the formerly 17,000 animals remaining.\" The mountain gorilla (G. b. beringei) has only about 880. Illegal hunting of these gorillas are the reason why they may go extinct. ==References== Category:Gorillas",
