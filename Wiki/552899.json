 "text": "There are 2 arrondissements in the Creuse department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of the Creuse are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 231 Aubusson Aubusson 37,123 2,538.8 118 232 Guéret Guéret 83,458 3,026.5 140 ==History== Since its creation, the Creuse department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the department with seven districts: Aubusson, Bourganeuf, Boussac, Évaux, Felletin, Guéret and La Souterraine; the capital was Guéret, alternating with Aubusson but soon only Guéret remained as capital. * 1800 : creation of four arrondissements: Aubusson, Bourganeuf, Boussac and Guéret. * 1926 : the arrondissements of Bourganeuf and Boussac were eliminated.
