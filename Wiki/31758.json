 "text": "Astana (, ), previously known as Akmolinsk (Russian: Акмолинск, romanized: Akmolinsk), Tselinograd, and Nur-Sultan, is the capital city of Kazakhstan. Astana has an estimated population of 1,184,469. It has been the capital of Kazakhstan since 1998. The name \"Astana\", which in Kazakh language means \"Capital city\", was chosen because it is easily pronounced in many languages. In Kazakh, it is pronounced \"As-ta-na\", while in English (and, for instance, German), common pronunciation is \"As-ta-na\". It is in the Aqmola Province. On 23 March 2019, a unanimous vote in Kazakhstan's parliament agreed to the new name. The city was renamed Nur-Sultan, after former president Nursultan Nazarbayev. The name was changed back to Astana in September 2022. == References ==",
