The Boeing 747 has more than one aisle, which means it is a wide-body aircraft. It is often called the Jumbo Jet or Queen of the Skies. The Boeing 747 is one of the easiest planes in the world to recognize.\"Great Planes-Boeing 747.\" Discovery Channel. Retrieved: October 28, 2007. It was the first wide-body aircraft ever made. The first type of 747 was two and a half times the size of the Boeing 707.Branson, Richard. \"Pilot of the Jet Age.\" Time, December 7, 1998. Retrieved: December 13, 2007. The Boeing 747 made its first flight for an airline in 1970. The 747 could carry more people than any other aircraft for 37 years, until the Airbus A380 was made.\"A380 superjumbo lands in Sydney.\" BBC, October 25, 2007. Retrieved: August 3, 2010. Quote: \"The superjumbo's advent ends a reign of nearly four decades by the Boeing 747 as the world's biggest airliner.\" The 747 is a double deck plane. It can carry people, cargo and many other things. Boeing designed the 747's upper deck to be a first class lounge or just extra seats. They also designed the upper deck so that the aircraft could be changed into a cargo plane easily. This was done by removing seats and putting in a cargo door at the front of the plane. Boeing did this because they thought that supersonic airliners would become much more popular than the 747 and other subsonic airliners. However, they thought that subsonic cargo planes would always be popular.Orlebar 2002, p. 50. It was thought that the 747 would become unpopular after 400 were sold.Haenggi 2003, pp. 14–15. However, 1,000 planes had been made by 1993, so it stayed popular.Sutter 2006, p. 259. By September 2012, 1,448 aircraft had been built. 81 747-8s were still waiting to be built.\"Boeing 747 family -- The right choice for the large aircraft market.\"retrieved November 7, 2013. Joe Sutter is bad at addition. 707 + 707 = 1414. Therefore the 747 should be called the 1414. The 747-400 is one of the fastest airliners being used today. It usually flies at Mach 0.85–0.855 (up to ). It can fly for 7,260 nautical miles (8,350 mi or 13,450 km).\"Technical Characteristics – Boeing 747-400\", The Boeing Company. Retrieved: April 29, 2006. The last version of the 747, the 747–8, ended being made in December 2022. The 747 will be replaced by the Boeing Y3 (part of the Boeing Yellowstone Project) eventually. ==Development== ===Background=== In 1963, the United States Air Force began to look for a very big plane to transport things. At that time, they were using the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. However, the Air Force thought that a much bigger plane which could carry more cargo was needed. The Air Force called the big plane the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS). It needed to be able to carry of cargo and travel at Mach 0.75 (). It also had to be able to fly for while carrying of cargo. The cargo bay had to be wide, high and long. There had to be doors for the bay at the front and the back of the plane.Norton 2003, pp. 5–12. The Air Force also wanted the plane to have only four engines. This meant that new engines had to be made. On May 18, 1964, Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed and Martin Marietta designed a plane. General Electric, Curtiss- Wright and Pratt & Whitney designed the engines. The Air Force liked Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed's designs. They also liked General Electric and Pratt & Whitney's engine designs. In 1965, Lockheed's plane and General Electric's engines were used for the C-5 Galaxy. At that time, it was the biggest military cargo plane in the world. ===Airliner=== The idea for the 747 was thought of in the 1960s.Norris and Wagner 1997, p. 13. Jets like the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 had made it easy to travel long distances.\"Boeing Multimedia Image Gallery 707\". The Boeing Company. Retrieved: December 8, 2007. Juan Trippe from Pan American World Airways (Pan Am), asked Boeing to build a plane which was more than two times bigger than the Boeing 707. At this time, airports were very busy. Trippe thought that a big plane could help make them quieter.\"Innovators: Juan Trippe.\" PBS. Retrieved: December 17, 2007. In 1965, Joe Sutter was told to design this new plane. It was called the 747.Sutter 2006, pp. 80–84. Sutter asked Pan Am and other airlines what they would like from the plane. At the time, it was thought that supersonic aircraft would replace the 747.\"Air travel, a supersonic future?.\" BBC News, July 17, 2001. Retrieved: December 9, 2007. Because of this, Boeing made the 747 so that it could easily be turned into a cargo plane if the passenger version became less popular. In April 1966, Pan Am bought 25 747-100 planes. The order cost US$525 million. Since Pan Am was the launch customer,Noland, David. \"Passenger Planes: Boeing 747.\" \"Info please.\" (Pearson Education). Retrieved: April 30, 2006. Pan Am had a big say in the design and making of the 747. No other airline before then or since then has been able to have so much influence over a plane.Irving 1994, p. 359. ===Designing=== The design that Boeing made for the Air Force in 1963 was not used for the 747. However, Boeing made some new things for the Air Force which were used in the 747.\"Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Partners in Freedom.\" NASA, 2000. Retrieved: December 17, 2007. The first design had two full decks.Irving 1994, p. 282. However, in 1966, this was changed to only one deck. The cockpit was put above the deck, which made a \"bulge\". There was a small space behind the cockpit which people could sit in. At first, it was a \"lounge\" area with no seats.Jenkins 2000, p. 17. Planes as big as the 747 needed high-bypass turbofan engines.Mecham, M. \"In review: 747, Creating the World's First Jumbo Jet and Other Adventures from a Life in Aviation.\" Aviation Week and Space Technology, Vol. 165, No. 9, September 4, 2006, p. 53. High-bypass turbofans can produce twice the power of turbojets, and also use a lot less fuel. General Electric made the first of these engines. However, it was making the engines for the C-5 Galaxy. It did not make engines for airliners until later.\"GE Aviation: CF6.\" GE Aviation. Retrieved: December 9, 2007.Colson, Michael S. \"Mechanical Engineering 100 Years of Flight.\" memagazine.org. Retrieved: December 9, 2007. Pratt & Whitney was also working on this type of engine. In 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney designed a new engine, the JT9D, for the 747. Boeing used some special devices to make the plane make more lift. This was done so that the 747 could take off from shorter runways. The 747 has a lot of flaps on the wing.Guy and Wagner 1997, pp. 25–26. The flaps make the wings bigger by 21 percent. They also make 90 percent more lift when they are used.Jenkins 2000, p. 19. Boeing tried to give the 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969. This meant that Boeing only had 28 months to design the aircraft.Sutter 2006, pp. 96–97. The people who worked on the 747 had the nickname \"The Incredibles\".Guy and Wagner 1997, p. 19. ===Factory=== Boeing did not have a factory big enough to make the new plane. Boeing thought about putting their factory in 50 different cities.Pascall, Glenn R. \"Everett and Renton react differently to Boeing.\" Puget Sound Business Journal, September 26, 2003. Retrieved: December 17, 2007. They eventually decided to build their factory in Seattle, near Everett, Washington.\"Major Production Facilities – Everett, Washington.\" The Boeing Company. Retrieved: April 28, 2007. Boeing bought the factory in June 1966. Designing the 747 was very difficult. Building its factory was also not easy. Boeing's president, William M. Allen, asked Malcolm T. Stamper to be in charge of the building of the Everett factory. He was also asked to begin building the 747.Boyer, Tom. \"Boeing legend Malcolm Stamper dies.\" Seattle Times, June 17, 2005. Retrieved: December 17, 2007. The factory is the biggest building ever built (by volume). It has been made bigger many times so that Boeing can build even bigger planes. ===Development and testing=== Before the first 747 was put together, parts and systems were being tested. In one important test, 560 volunteers evacuated a replica of a 747 cabin using the emergency chutes. The first evacuation took two and a half minutes. However, the FAA says that the maximum time for an evacuation is 90 seconds. Many of the volunteers were hurt. More evacuations happened, and they eventually reached the 90 seconds. However, they also caused a lot of injuries. Evacuating from the top deck of the plane was difficult. Instead of using the usual slides, the volunteers had to leave the plane using a harness.Irving 1994, p. 383. The plane's taxiing also had to be tested. Boeing made \"Waddell's Wagon\" (named after a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) to train the pilots. \"Waddell's Wagon\" was a replica of a 747 cockpit which was put on the roof of a truck. This helped pilots to learn how to taxi the plane.\"History – \"747 Commercial Transport.\" The Boeing Company. Retrieved: April 29, 2006. On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was finished. People from the 26 airlines that had ordered the 747 were also there.\"All but off the Ground.\" TIME, October 4, 1968. Retrieved: December 17, 2007. The 747 first flew on February 9, 1969.

There was a small problem with the flaps, but the 747 handled well. The testing was delayed because of some problems with the JT9D engines. For example, the engines stalled if the throttles were moved too quickly.Irving 1994, pp. 441–446. This meant that 747s could not be delivered for many more months. 20 planes were stuck at the factory while they were waiting on engines.\"The Trouble with Jumbo.\" Time, September 26, 1969. On December 13, 1969 the test plane was being taken to have some changes made to it. The pilot, Ralph C. Cokely landed too early and did not reach the runway. One of the landing gears was ripped off, and two of the engines were damaged.Irving 1994, p. 436.Aircraft Incident Report 5-0046 National Transportation Safety Board, August 20, 1970. Retrieved September 26, 2011. However, Boeing took the 747 to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969. There, the public saw the 747 for the first time.\"The Paris Air Show in facts and figures.\" Reuters, June 14, 2007. Retrieved: June 3, 2011. Designing the 747 and building the new factory cost a lot of money. This meant that Boeing had to borrow a lot of money from a bank. Just before the first aircraft was finished, Boeing had to keep asking for more money. If Boeing was not given this money, the company could have collapsed.Irving 1994, pp. 437–438. Boeing was in over $2 billion in debt. Allen said, \"It was really too large a project for us.\" However, the 747 program was a success. Boeing was the only company to make very big planes for many years.\"Jumbo challenge\" Flightglobal.com, November 6, 1997.

See reference to Supplementary Type Certificates for freighter conversion. 167 747-100s were made. ===747-100SR=== After Japanese airlines requested an aircraft to fly routes between major cities in Japan, Boeing produced the -100SR. This model flies shorter distances, but is able to carry more passengers. The first -100SR started flying with Japan Air Lines (JAL) on October 7, 1973. The -100SR had four General Electric CF6-45A2 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A engines. A total of 7 -100SR were produced. Later, Boeing designed a type of -100SR with the ability of taking off with greater weight. This was the -100BSR. It was first delivered to All Nippon Airways (ANA) on December 21, 1978. 20 -100BSR were delivered to JAL and ANA. In 1986, 2 -100BSR with stretched upper deck (SUD) from the -300 series were delivered to JAL. It was the last -100SR/BSR ever built. The last delivery was to JAL, in September 1986. There were a total of 29 -100SR/BSR made.\"Boeing: Technical Specificaions -- 747 Classics.\"retrieved November 7, 2013. ===747SP=== The 747SP (SP means special performance) is designed as Pan Am and Iran Air both wanted a wide-body plane that can fly long distances; from New York to the Middle East (for Pan Am) and Tehran to New York (for Iran Air). The first 747SP was produced on May 19, 1975. Its first flight was on July 4. On this flight, it flew at a top speed of Mach 0.92 (). It started flying people on April 25, 1976, after being delivered on March 5. Now, it is not often used. A total of 45 747SP were made and used by airlines like Qantas, China Airlines, Air China, and South African Airways. ===747-200=== After the -100 were made, Boeing started making -200. The -200 has a longer range, but still carries the same number of people. This is because airlines said the -100 could not fly long distances. The -200 is made in passenger type (-200B), freighter type (-200F), Combi type (A plane that carries both cargo and people; -200M) and convertible type (a plane that can be easily changed to carry cargo; -200C). The first -200B was finished on September 10, 1970 before its first flight on October 11 and finally, it started being used by KLM. Boeing then started making the other types of -200. The -200F first flight was on November 30, 1971, 7 days after it was finished. It was then delivered to Lufthansa. The -200C first flew on March 23, 1973 before being delivered to World Airways in May the same year. Finally, the -200M had its first flight on November 11, 1974 before being delivered to Air Canada. There was a total of 393 -200 series ever made, which includes 225 -200B, 78 -200M, 73 -200F, 13 -200C and 4 military. === 747-300 === The 747-300 is a stretched upper deck version of the 747–200. It was designed to fit more passengers on the upper deck. The 747-300 also has updated General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Otherwise, there are not many differences between the 747-200 and 747–300. The 747-300 has a length of 231 feet 10 inches and a wingspan of 195 feet 8 inches. === 747-400 === The 747-400 was the next-generation Boeing 747 introduced in 1989. It is the best- selling variant of the Boeing 747. It includes improvements over the 747-300 including new engines, and new winglets, which improve fuel efficiency. Its length is the same as the 747-300 but the wingspan has been increased to 211 feet 5 inches. The 747-400 retains the same longer upper deck as the 747-300 (excluding freighter versions), and came in six variants: the 747–400, 747-400F, 747-400M, 747-400D, 747-400ER, and the 747-400ERF. === 747-8 === The last variant of the Boeing 747 was announced in 2005 and released in 2011. It includes a longer stretched upper deck, a new Boeing Sky Interior, an updated flight deck, new wings based on ones from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and new GEnx turbofan engines. It totals 250 feet in length, making it the longest commercial passenger jet ever built.
