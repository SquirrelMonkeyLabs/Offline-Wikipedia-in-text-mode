 "text": "In 1620, the Mayflower brought 102 passengers from England and Holland to what is now Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The group included people seeking religious freedom. This voyage is one of the most famous in early American history. The Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower intended to sail to the Virginia Colony. They landed instead on Cape Cod and formed the Plymouth Colony.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 17 == Voyage == The Mayflower left England with the ship Speedwell on 15 August 1620, carrying Pilgrims from England and Holland. However, the Speedwell turned out to be unseaworthy. Both ships were twice forced to return to England. The Mayflower finally left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. On 19 November 1620 they spotted land. However, because of storms and navigation problems, they were much farther north than they intended. On 21 November 1620 they landed on Cape Cod. The passengers lived on the ship for a few months. They went ashore to build shelters during the day, then returned to the ship at night. During the winter of 1620-1621, about half of the passengers died. By March 1621, there were enough shelters for everyone to live on land. === Mayflower Compact === See the main article: Mayflower Compact While still aboard the Mayflower, the Pilgrims wrote a set of rules about how they would live and treat each other.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 20, 411-413George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920). Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document pp. 7â€“19. This is an important document in American history. It includes democratic ideals, and it designed a framework for the first government in what is now the United States. == Related pages == * Mayflower passenger list == References == ==Other websites== * Pilgrim Hall Museum of Plymouth, Massachusetts * General Society of Mayflower Descendants * The Mayflower And Her Log ; Azel Ames, Project Gutenberg edition. * Mayflower Descendants Chart . * Pilgrims and the Mayflower Mayflower Interior Pictured Category:Plymouth Colony Category:1620 Category:1620s in the Thirteen Colonies",
