 "text": "In chemistry, a suspension is a mixture of two or more components. In a suspension, very small pieces of solid are mixed in a liquid but do not dissolve. If left still, the solid pieces will separate from the liquid and either fall to the bottom or rise to the top. Sand in water and flour in water are examples of suspensions. Suspensions may separate quickly or stay suspended for a long time, depending on what they contain. If a liquid is suspended in another liquid, it is called an emulsion. Milk is an emulsion. If a liquid is suspended in a gas it is an aerosol. Mist is an aerosol. == References == Category:Chemistry",
