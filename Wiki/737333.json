 "text": "Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People, commonly known as the Trump peace plan, is a proposal by the Trump administration to resolve the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. Donald Trump formally unveiled the plan in a White House press conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on January 28, 2020; Palestinian representatives were not invited. The plan was authored by a team led by Trump's son-in-law, Senior Advisor to the President of the United States Jared Kushner. Both the West Bank settlers' Yesha Council and the Palestinian leadership rejected the plan, arguing it is too biased in favor of Israel. The plan is divided into two parts, an economic portion and a political portion. On June 22, 2019, the Trump administration released the economic portion of the plan, titled \"Peace to Prosperity\". The political portion was released in late January 2020. ==References== Category:Donald Trump Category:June 2019 events Category:January 2020 events",
