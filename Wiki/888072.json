 "text": "The Guatemala spikethumb frog (Plectrohyla guatemalensis) is a frog that lives in Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador. It lives in pine-oak forests and cloud forests. Scientists have seen it between 900 and 2800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 40.0 to 52.1 mm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 42.1 to 54.1 mm long. The male frog has thicker front legs than the female frog. This frog has dark green skin. Some of them have red spots. It can be tan or gray near the rear end. Its belly is white. During the day, this frog sits on rocks or plants near streams. The female frog lays eggs at the bottoms of streams or on roots. There are fewer of these frogs than there used to be because human beings build things where the frog likes to live. Scientists say it is possible that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis also kills this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
