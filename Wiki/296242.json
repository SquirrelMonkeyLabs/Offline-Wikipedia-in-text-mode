The supercells then merged into a massive squall line of severe thunderstorms. The severe thunderstorms produced tornadoes. Then, heavy rain formed northwest of the line of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. An EF2 tornado struck Vilonia, Arkansas, and an EF3 tornado struck Hot Springs Village, Arkansas. Later, the severe thunderstorms and tornadoes moved into Tennessee and Mississippi. ===April 26=== On April 26, the severe thunderstorms and tornadoes moved back into Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. On the evening of April 26, dangerous supercells formed over Texas. Those supercells produced dangerous tornadoes, like EF2 or EF3. Then, those supecells moved into Oklahoma and Arkansas. The squall line of severe thunderstorms moved back into Tennessee and Mississippi. ===April 27=== On April 27, the supercells moved into Tennessee and Mississippi, and the squall line of severe thunderstorms moved into Alabama. Then, the supercells moved into Alabama, and produced 4 EF5 tornadoes, 13 EF4 tornadoes, and 23 EF3 tornadoes. The squall line of severe thunderstorms moved into Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina. ===April 28=== On April 28, the supercells merged into a very large squall line, and moved into Kentucky and the Carolinas. The old squall line of severe thunderstorms moved into Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Then later, the new squall line moved into Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. The storm produced some tornadoes. The other squall lines disappeared. There were five deaths. == Aftermath == The Governor of Alabama, Robert J. Bentley, declared a state of emergency in Alabama after the outbreak.
