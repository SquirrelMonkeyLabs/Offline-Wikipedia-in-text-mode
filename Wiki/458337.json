The song was released by Republic Records on April 28, 2014. It is the first single from Ariana Grande's second studio album My Everything (2014). The song first appeared at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. It later peaked at number two on the chart. It sold 438,000 copies in its first week on sale. Lyrically, the song is about \"the feeling of being absolutely terrified to re-approach a relationship that's gone sour -- but you want to more than anything.\" The song reached number one in the UK (where it became the first song to enter on top based on streaming alone). It also topped the charts in New Zealand and reached the top ten in nine other countries. The Recording Industry Assocation of America certified the song sextuple-platinum on June 15, 2015, for sales of over six million copies in the US alone. == Music video == The video stars Grande and Azalea performing choreography with backup dancers against spiral backgrounds. Grande's then-boyfriend, rapper Big Sean, appears in the video. Sean also whispered the hook, \"I got one less problem without you,\" throughout the song but is not credited. As of March 2018, the music video has surpassed one billion views on YouTube. ==References== ==Other websites== * Lyric video on Vevo * * Category:2014 songs Category:R&B; songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Ariana Grande songs Category:Iggy Azalea",
