The majority of Georgians are Eastern Orthodox Christian. They mostly go by the national autocephalous Georgian Orthodox Church, which started in the 4th century. There are also Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities in Tbilisi and Adjara. Located in Caucasus at the edge of Europe, the Georgian people have tried to keep their Christian identity. There is a lot of pressure from the neighboring Muslim empires. The Georgian language is the official language of the country. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Asia Category:Ethnic groups in Europe Category:Georgia (country) Category:Ethnic groups in Azerbaijan",
