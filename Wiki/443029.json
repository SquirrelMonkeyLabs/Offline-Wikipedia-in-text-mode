 "text": "Pawleys Island is a seaport town in northeastern South Carolina. In 2020, 130 people lived there. This town is near Georgetown. Many cypress cottages on Pawleys Island were built during the 20th century. That made people call the town arrogantly shabby. In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck south of Pawleys Island. Some cottages were totally destroyed. Category:Towns in South Carolina",
