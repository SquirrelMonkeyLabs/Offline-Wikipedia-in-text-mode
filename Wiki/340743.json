Other hairless dog breeds are the American Hairless Terrier, Mexican Hairless Dog, Peruvian Hairless Dog, and Hairless Khala. Hairless Chinese cresteds often win the World's Ugliest Dog Contest, which takes place every year in Petaluma, California. The Chinese crested is a friendly, intelligent animal. ==References== Category:Dog breeds originating in China Category:FCI breeds",
