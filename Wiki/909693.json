 "text": "The Mission golden-eyed tree frog, Amazon milk frog, blue milk frog, or Kunawalu casque-headed frog (Trachycephalus resinifictrix) is a frog that lives in Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, and the Guianas. Scientists think it might also live in Colombia. The adult male frog is about 7.7 cm long and the adult female frog is about 8.8 cm long. The skin on the frog's back is dark brown with green or lighter brown spots. The legs and toes have cream and black marks on them. Each frog has a triangle-shaped spot between its eyes with one point pointing toward the frog's nose. The irises of the eyes have a shape called a Maltese cross in them. This animal hides during the day and looks for food at night. It spends most of its time in the tree branches. The female frog lays eggs in water-filled holes in trees. The tadpoles eat dead plants and other eggs from the same species. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
