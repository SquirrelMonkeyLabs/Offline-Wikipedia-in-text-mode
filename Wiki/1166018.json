 "text": "Naval architecture, or naval engineering, is a type of engineering that includes parts of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software, and safety engineering. It is used for designing, building, taking care of, and running ships and water structures. Ship building and design includes basic and deep study, making new designs, improving designs, checking designs, and doing math for all steps in a shipâ€™s life. The main steps are early design, full design, building, testing, using, taking care of, launching, and lifting ships out of water. Math is also needed when changing ships by fixing, rebuilding, updating, or repairing them. Ship building and design also includes making safety rules, damage control rules, and checking if ship designs follow required rules. ==References== Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Ship building",
