 "text": "Orellana's collared frog (Mannophryne orellana) is a frog. It lives in the Cordillera de Mérida and Cordillera Oriental de Colombia in Venezuela. Scientists think it might live in Colombia too. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams in forests on mountains. It also lives near streams in forests that are growing back, coffee farms, and cocoa farms. Scientists saw the frog between 482 and 1192 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in one protected park: El Tamá National Park. The frog lives near Tapo-Caparo National Park. ==Young== The male frogs call to the female frogs. Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Mannophryne do: The female frogs lay eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out, even though it lives in a park. The government of Venezuela does not always make people follow the law. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places to raise animals. People also take water from streams for farms. Chemicals from farms and dirty water from buildings could also hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
