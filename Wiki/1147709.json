 "text": "The FG Steyr (“Fußballgemeinschaft Steyr”) was a war-related merger of the soccer clubs SK Amateure and SK Vorwärts from the Upper Austrian district town of Steyr and existed from April 1944 until the end of 1944. ==History == In the 1943/44 season, SK Amateure Steyr played in the Gauliga Donau-Alpenland, the highest division in eastern Austrian soccer at the time. With the proclamation of total war and the conscription of all men halfway fit for military service, the clubs in the top divisions also had to face problems. SK Amateure no longer had enough footballers to play. The club was forced to withdraw from the Gauliga on April 20, 1944. In April 1944, the team merged with SK Vorwärts Steyr, who played in the Salzburg-Oberdonau league. The now merged club, which started the season as SK Vorwärts, finished the 1943/44 championship season without defeat and won the championship with a four-point lead over SG Reichsbahn Linz. Promotion to the Gauliga was not possible due to the decision to compete exclusively with clubs from the Vienna in the 1944/45 season. The championship of the 1944/45 season in the regional league, which was once again limited to clubs from Upper Danube, was stopped in the fall of 1944 due to the course of the war. At this point, the FG Steyr had played seven matches and was in fourth place in the table. After the championship was stopped , the club was dissolved. In the 1945/46 season, both SK Amateure and SK Vorwärts once again competed as independent clubs in the Upper Austrian regional league.
