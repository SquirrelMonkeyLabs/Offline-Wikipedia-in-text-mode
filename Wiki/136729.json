 "text": "The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier is a 4,000-kilometer fence that India is presently constructing to seal off the Indian-Bangladeshi international border from what was formerly East Bengal. East Bengal was a partitioned region of Bengal, called East Pakistan from 1956 to 1971. This obstruction is virtually isolating Bangladesh from the rest of India to a very large extent nowadays, since the Modi Govt. intervention, regarding the disputes along Indo-Bangla Border, along with the records of illegal immigrants of people belonging to both of the nations.
