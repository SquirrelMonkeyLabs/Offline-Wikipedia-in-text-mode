 "text": "Float glass is a sheet of glass made by melting glass and spreading it on molten metal that has a low melting point, such as tin, or lead. In this way, we get a very flat and evenly thick surface. Making float glass like that, is also known as the Pilkington process. It was given this name, because the glass-making company Pilkington was the first to use this way of making glass in the 1950s, at their factory in St Helens, Merseyside, England. Modern windows are usually made from float glass. Some types of glass used for screens are also made in the same way as float glass. == References == == Other websites == * Float Glass Manufacture Process from the Glass Association of North America Category:Glass Category:Manufacturing",
