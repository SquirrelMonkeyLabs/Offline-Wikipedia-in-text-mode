 "text": "Antigone is a play written by Sophocles about Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus. Antigone is an Athenian tragedy written by Sophocles in (or before) 441 BC. It was first performed at the Festival of Dionysus of the same year. Antigone may be the second oldest surviving play of Sophocles, after Ajax, which was written around the same time. The play is one of the three tragedies, known as the three Theban plays. They follow the history of Oedipus Rex and Oedipus at Colonus. Even though it is the third in order of the events told in the plays, Antigone was the first to be written. The story is based on an older Theban legend. It starts where Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes ends. The play is named after the main protagonist, Antigone. Note: there is also an ancient Greek play by Euripides which is also titled \"Antigone\". == References == Category:Theatre of ancient Greece Category:5th-century BC plays",
