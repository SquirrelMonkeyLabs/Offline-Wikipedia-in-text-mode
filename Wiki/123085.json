The Seattle SuperSonics franchise had moved to Oklahoma, which meant that there was a new team name (Oklahoma City Thunder). Because of this, the Thunder replaced Seattle in the Western Conference's Northwest Division and began play at Oklahoma City's Ford Center, now known as Paycom Center, during the 2008â€“09 NBA season. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1967 establishments in the United States",
