 "text": "Critical thinking is a smart way of thinking. It means looking carefully at information or problems and deciding if they are good or not. One has to think in a clear and organized way. One also have to ask questions, think about different ideas, and make choices based on proof and good reasons. Thinking ahead and analyzing things for the future is also part of critical thinking. It's not just about what's happening now, but also thinking about what might come next and how things could change in the future. Critical thinking is very important for making good decisions, solving problems, and handling difficult situations. ==Process== To engage in reflective thinking about a statement of truth and avoid being easily fooled, questions about it can be written as clearly and simply as possible, making certain that all terms are well understood by giving definitions if necessary. Critical thinking is a method for determining whether a claim is true, false, sometimes true and sometimes false, or partly true and partly false. To establish the truth of a claim, one requires evidence or information to verify its legitimacy. Information is found in libraries, online sources, and through interviews with experts in the respective fields. Trained librarians can help in researching library materials, and some are proficient in helping with computer and internet resources. Then critically evaluating the context in which a claim is made, judging the quality of information (updated, thorough, well-informed, and impartial), understanding any biases present through asking probing questions, and recognizing how the pieces of information relate to each other, one can ascertain the accuracy of the statement of truth or a claim. To better understand biases one can use various methods, these include thinking about different ideas and reasons why people might disagree, checking what we think is true, being aware of how information is presented, spotting ways where the author is trying to convincing, recognizing how things that happened before can be similar to what might happen now if they share similar parts or situations, etc. Critical thinking tools come from different fields of study like statistics, logistics, semantics, experimental research methodology, psychology, sociology, etc. ==Related pages== * Age of Enlightenment * Argument * Critic * Dialectic * Disinformation * International Philosophy Olympiad * Logic Category:Evaluation Category:Analysis",
