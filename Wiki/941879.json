Also, his view was obstructed due to thick cloud cover. In addition, it was found that in the minutes prior to the accident, the crew, including the captain, were chatting with potential customers present in the cabin. ==Victims== Nationality Passengers Crew Total Indonesia 35 35 Russia 8 8 United States 1 1 France 1 1 Total 37 8 45 ==References== ==Other websites== * National Transportation Safety Committee ** , 18 December 2012 ** Category:2012 disasters Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:2012 in Asia Category:History of Java Category:May 2012 events Category:West Java Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the 2010s",
