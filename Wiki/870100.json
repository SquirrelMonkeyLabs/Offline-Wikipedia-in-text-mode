 "text": "Surah Al-An'am (Arabic: سورة الأنعام, \"meaning the animal\") Muslim religious texts of the Qur'an 6 Number of Surat , the number of verses 165 and the number of rukura. This Surah was revealed in Makkah . This Surah Allah's Oneness, punarutthana, Heaven and Hell have been discussed. == Name == In this Surah, in the 16th and 18th Ruku, the imaginary and superstitious idea of the Arabs regarding the prohibition of some An'am (domesticated animals) and the halal of some of them has been refuted. In this context, this Surah has been named Al An'am. == Time of revelation == According to Ibn 'Abbas, this entire Surah was revealed in Makkah at the same time. Hazrat Asma bint Yazid , the cousin of Hazrat Muaz Ibn Jabal , said that this Surah was revealed while the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was riding on a camel. Then I was holding the reins of her camel. Under the weight of the burden, the camel's condition had reached such a level that it seemed as if this understanding would break her bones. It is also clearly stated in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recorded this Surah on the night it was revealed. If we think about its subject matter, it is clear that this Surah would have been revealed towards the end of the Meccan period. The narration of Hazrat Asma bint Yazid also proves this to be true. Because he belonged to the Ansar. After the migration he converted to Islam. If he had attended the service of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Makkah out of sheer devotion before accepting Islam, he would surely have been in the last year of his stay in Makkah. Earlier, his relationship with the people of Yasreb was not so close that one of their women could come to his service. == Other websites == * Quran 6 Clear Quran translation == Reference == Category:Chapters in the Quran",
