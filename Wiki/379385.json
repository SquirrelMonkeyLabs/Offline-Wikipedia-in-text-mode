 "text": "Man-Bat (The Werebat or Dr. Robert K. Langstrom) is a fictional Batman character who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. == Fictional character biography == He used to be a scientist until drinking a chemical that makes him turn into a half bat half man. His name can sometimes be confused with Batman. == Powers and abilities == By taking his bat gland extract, Kirk Langstrom transforms himself into a bat-like creature. When taking an antidote or if the serum wears off, he reverts to human form. As the Man-Bat, his strength, resiliency, speed, and agility are all augmented to inhuman levels. He possesses an extra set of digits in his leathery wings that allows Kirk to fly. With his sonar radar, Kirk can emit high-pitch sound waves and hear those echoes when they bounce off of nearby objects, thus enabling him to navigate perfectly in the darkness. If in the Man-Bat form for long periods of time, he loses control over his bestial side that works purely on instinct, plus making him prone to harm friend or foe alike. As Kirk Langstrom, he is a highly intelligent scientist in the fields of biochemistry and zoology (particularly chiropterology). == In other media == The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as feature movies, television series and video games. He was voiced by Marc Singer in Batman: The Animated Series and Loren Lester in Batman: Arkham Knight.
