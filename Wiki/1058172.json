 "text": "The WAGR Ca class were a total of 10 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1915 to 1949. The Ca class were built at Midland Railway Workshops in 1915 as 4-6-2 tender engines, matching the rebuilt design of the standard C class which was originally built as a 4-6-0. In 1919 the Ca designation was abolished as all C class engines were practically identical, so all had the 'a' suffix dropped. All were rebuilt to Cs class specifications from 1929 to 1949, with the last scrapped in 1964 at Subiaco. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
