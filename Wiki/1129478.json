 "text": "Coq au vin is a French stew made with chicken, wine, bacon, and vegetables. ==History== The name means \"rooster in wine\" in French. The first book to mention coq au vin was Cookery for English Households, a cookbook from 1864. It existed for a long time before this, but most stories about the invention of coq au vin are myths. ==Ingredients== Coq au vin is made by cooking onions and garlic in butter in a pot. Pieces of chicken, bacon and mushrooms are then added to the pot. Once the meat has cooked, wine is poured in to make a broth. The stew is simmered in the pot until it is ready to eat. Most recipes use red wine, but in some parts of France they use other types of wine. ==References== Category:Chicken as food Category:French food",
