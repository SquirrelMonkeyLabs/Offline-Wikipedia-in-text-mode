 "text": "Leon Czolgosz (May 5, 1873 – October 29, 1901) was an American laborer and anarchist who assassinated United States President William McKinley. == Life == Czolgosz was born in either Detroit or Alpena, Michigan, to Prussian immigrant parents. He became involved in the anarchist movement and was influenced by Emma Goldman. He was an outsider within the anarchist movement. At one point, other anarchists accused him of being a spy. === McKinley assassination === On September 6, 1901 the Pan-American Exposition was in Buffalo, New York. McKinley appeared at its Temple of Music to meet with members of the public. Czolgosz waited in line to see McKinley, then shot him twice. The president died eight days later. === Arrest & trial === Czolgosz was arrested immediately, and an attempt was made to lynch him. He quickly confessed to killing McKinley, saying: > I made my plans 3 or 4 days ago to shoot the President. When I shot him I > intended to kill him and the reason for my intention in killing was because > I did not believe in presidents over us. I was willing to sacrifice myself & > the president for the benefit of the Country. His trial began on September 23, 1901 and lasted just eight hours. Czolgosz refused to help his defense attorneys, and they called no witnesses. The jury took about 30 minutes to convict him and sentence him to death. === Execution === On October 29, 1901, Czolgosz was executed in the electric chair at Auburn State Prison in west-central New York. == Motives == Czolgosz's last words were: \"I killed the president because he was the enemy of the good people — the working people.\" According to A. Wesley Johns: > He apparently got the idea of shooting McKinley after reading [about] an > anarchist's assassination of King [Umberto] I of Italy in 1900, although he > later claimed a speech by noted anarchist Emma Goldman delivered at > Cleveland's FRANKLIN CLUB in May 1901 incited him. == References == Category:1873 births Category:1901 deaths Category:American anarchists Category:American people executed for murder Category:Anarchists Category:Assassins Category:Criminals from Michigan Category:People executed by electric chair Category:William McKinley",
