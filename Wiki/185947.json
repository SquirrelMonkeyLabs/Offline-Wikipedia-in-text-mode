 "text": "London City Airport DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway which serves the London City Airport, and which opened in 2 December 2005. It is on the King George V branch. Trains run westbound to Bank in the City of London and eastbound to Woolwich Arsenal. Until the extension to Woolwich Arsenal this station was the main reason for this branch. It continues to be an important station on the DLR. It has an excellent direct covered connection with adjacent airport terminal building. Although the station maintains the DLR philosophy of basic good design it makes various concessions to cater for airport passengers including a fully enclosed waiting room on the central island platform. The station is in the London Borough of Newham and is in Travelcard Zone 3. == Gallery == Image:London City Airport stn eastbound.JPG|Platforms looking east Image:London City Airport stn look west.JPG|Platforms looking west Image:London City Airport stn signage.JPG|Platform signage Image:London City Airport and station main entrance.JPG|Main entrance to the Airport and Station (DLR sign visible near bridge) Image:City Airport station.jpg|Platforms with westbound train calling Image:LCYDLR.jpg|Westbound train approaching station ==References== == Other websites == * * Street map of London City Airport DLR station from multimap.com * Docklands Light Railway website - London City Airport station page Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham Category:London Travelcard zone 3",
