 "text": "The Wallace's flying frog, flying tree frog, black-webbed tree frog, Wallace's whipping frog, Wallace's flying tree frog, or Wallace's tree frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus) is a frog that lives in Thailand, Malaya, Myanmar, Sumatra, and Borneo. People have seen it between 700 and 1800 feet above sea level (230 to 600 meters). The adult frog is about 90-100 mm long. The eyes are very large. There are large disks on its toes for climbing. The skin of the frog's back is green in color and shiny. It has some white marks. The sides, belly, and the insides of the hind legs are yellow in color. The webbed skin is black and yellow in color. The female frog makes a nest out of foam and puts the eggs in them. She leaves the nest on branches hanging over water. When the tadpoles come out of the eggs, they fall into the water below. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
