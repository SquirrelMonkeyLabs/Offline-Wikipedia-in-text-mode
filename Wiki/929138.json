 "text": "The National Parliament of Papua New Guinea is the unicameral national legislature in Papua New Guinea. It was created in 1964 as the House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea. After the nation was given independence in 1975, it became the National Parliament. The 111 members of parliament serve five-year terms, 89 of whom are chosen from single-member \"open\" electorates, which are sometimes known as \"seats\" but are officially known as constituencies. The remaining 22 are chosen from single-member provincial electorates: the 20 provinces, the autonomous province of Bougainville (North Solomons), and the National Capital District. ==References== Papua New Guinea Papua New Guinea",
