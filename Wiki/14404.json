He got a degree in law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, but instead of being a lawyer, he chose to be a diplomat and writer. He published his first novel, called La región más transparente (Where the Air Is Clear in English) in 1958. From 1975 to 1977, Fuentes was Mexico's ambassador to France.
