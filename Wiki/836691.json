 "text": "A mezuzah is a box with a scroll in it. Jews put on mezuzahs their doors. The mezuzah is written by a Jewish scribe called a Sofer. Most people put their mezuzah on the front doorpost, but halakha requires that every room with 36 square feet (but not bathrooms) should have a mezuzah on the right side of the doorpost. There are 4 different types of writing styles for Mezuzahs: Beis Yosef, Arizal, Sephardi and Alter Rebbe. In the United States, prices for Mezuzahs range from US$50 for a cheap mezuzah, $85 for a medium quality, and $130-150 for a high-quality mezuzah. The idea for mezuzah comes from Deuteronomy, chapter 6: \"And you shall inscribe them on the doorposts (mezuzot) of your house and on your gates.\" ==References== Category:Judaism",
