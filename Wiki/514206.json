 "text": "Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) is an 8-bit character encoding. It is used mainly on IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems. EBCDIC descended from the code used with punched cards. It was also related to the six bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. EBCDIC is also used on various non-IBM platforms. These include the Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, and Unisys VS/9 and MCP. == References == Category:Computer file formats",
