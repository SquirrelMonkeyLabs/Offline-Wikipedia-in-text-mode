The uniform styles that were worn include: Boston Bruins - circa 1933 Chicago Blackhawks - circa 1940 Detroit Red Wings - circa 1928 Montreal Canadiens - circa 1926 New York Rangers - circa 1940 Toronto Maple Leafs - circa 1940 Wales All-Stars - white All-Star jersey circa 1952 Campbell All-Stars - red All-Star jersey circa 1952 The throwback uniforms would have an impact on future seasons in the NHL, as several teams adopted throwbacks as alternate jerseys.
