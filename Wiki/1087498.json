 "text": "The spiny Indonesian tree frog (Nyctixalus spinosus) is a frog. It lives in the Philippines. People have seen it between 300 and 1430 meters above sea level. The adult frog is 30 to 37 mm long from nose to rear end. It is red- brown in color with small white bumps on it and yellow and orange spots. There is some webbed skin on the feet. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks on the front feet are larger than the disks on the back feet. The frog's belly and sides are orange-yellow in color. This frog lives in forests and in places near forests that humans have changed. The frog lives on the ground in the dead leaves on the ground. The female frog lays eggs in bits of water high up in the trees. The water is in holes in the trees. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. People cut down the forests to make small farms, large palm oil farms, and to collect wood to make charcoal. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
