 "text": "Male is one of two biological sexes. Most species have two sexes male and female. Human males are usually men or boys; human females are usually women or girls (Except if their gender does not correlate with their sex assigned at birth). The two sexes have different sexual organs, and different secondary sex characteristics. They also often have different biological functions. The female sexual organs can give birth to children with the semen provided by the male. In many human societies, females often were involved in gathering, while men used to hunt, but over the course of time, Gender equality has been (or is being) recognized in more and more countries. ==Related pages== * Female Category:Gender Category:Sex",
