 "text": "Thomas Smith (5 April 1945 – 12 April 2019) was an English footballer. He played as a defender. He was born in Liverpool. Smith was best remembered for his time at Liverpool for 16 years from 1962 to 1978. He was known for his firm defensive style. Manager Bill Shankly once said of him: \"Tommy Smith wasn't born, he was quarried\". He was also nicknamed the \"Anfield Iron\". His most memorable moment for the club probably came when he scored Liverpool's second goal in the 1977 European Cup Final against Borussia Mönchengladbach. He also played at club level for Tampa Bay Rowdies, Los Angeles Aztecs and Swansea City. He played once for England, in 1971. Smith had dementia in his final years.
