II Iberia worlds dominated He wore his haughty power, And their captive plants lay The East nameless be But suddenly his irons chopping Given the dogma that May inspired Among free despots fierce A bridge saw pit. III His billet chain guns, On his chest shield in battle, In his superb courage trembled The feudal champions of the Cid In the valleys, mountains and jungles Are undertaken with silent pride, With fierce rumbling roar The caves and the sky at once.

Heaven thunders storms, curses upon him, And the triumphant worship free the law to rich jewel. IX Shining adorned with laurels The pride of the South Amazon, In his bronze shield reflect Fortaleza, justice and virtue. Enemies will not humiliate the front Neither foot oppressors imposed That sealed his record troubles And baptism of blood in their faith. X Celebrating the glory and the day Of the sun of this new republic With glimpses of purple and gold, Decks your beautiful glow. The August dome of Olympus Shines, and a divine being With stars in the heavens writes, Sweet Fatherland, your name immortal. XI The law to swear to Numen Equality, patriotism and unity, Sacrificing their divine order Blind hatred, and black ambition. And find that insulting fierce The greatness of the Eastern People, For the enemies, the spear of Mars, For the tyrants the dagger of Brutus! 𝄆 Easterners, the Fatherland or the grave, Liberty or with glory, we die! 𝄇 𝄆 Is the vote that the soul pronounces, And which, heroically we will fulfill! 𝄇 We will fulfill!
