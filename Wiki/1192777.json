 "text": "Vichy syndrome is a word describing the guilt and denial of the French people over the war crimes of Vichy France during the Holocaust. ==Origin== The word was made by Jewish historian Henry Rousso in his 1987 book The Vichy Syndrome. He said that the war crimes of Vichy France remained a \"past that doesn't pass away\". The nature of Vichy French collaboration with Nazi Germany is a subject of debate. ==French government positions== The French government's position towards French responsibility for the Holocaust changed over the decades, with different presidents holding different views on the matter. ===Before Jacques Chirac=== Before Jacques Chirac became the president, the French government insisted that Vichy France was an illegal regime separate from France, denying that the French participated in the Holocaust. * * One of the first legal acts of the provisional government was to pass an ordinance reestablishing the rule of law: Ordonnance du 9 août 1944 relative au rétablissement de la légalité républicaine sur le territoire continental, article 1. * * ===Jacques Chirac=== Jacques Chirac was the first president to say that the French participated in the Holocaust. ===Emmanuel Macron=== Emmanuel Macron said on July 16, 2017 that Vichy France was the France during World War II, accepting responsibility for the Holocaust. When discussing the Vel' d'Hiver roundup, Macron said: ==Holocaust denial in France== From the end of the war to the 1970s, it was a common illusion that almost every Frenchman was in the Resistance, or at least supported it, and that the collaborators were a minority. Another two popular beliefs went along with this, that of the \"sword and shield\", and the idea that to whatever extent there were harsh measures under the Vichy regime, it was because it was under the boot of the Germans and not by choice. ===Proliferation=== Particularly, anti-Zionists played a huge role in promoting Holocaust denial in France. For instance, Pierre Guillaume, an ultra-left anarcho-Marxist activist, published books denying the Holocaust, calling it a \"distraction from class struggle\" that \"played into the hands of Zionism and Stalinism\". * * * Despite being left-wing, Guillaume's views were adopted by the French far right, who have trivialized the Holocaust by comparing the Holocaust to the Judean massacres of the Canaanites or the Native American genocide, and accused Jews of exploiting the Holocaust to extort compensations from European countries. A number of influential French Holocaust deniers emerged, such as Claude Autant-Lara, Maurice Bardèche, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Paul Rassinier, François Duprat, Serge Thion, Robert Faurisson, * * * and Dieudonné M'bala M'bala. Today, the few remaining defenders of Vichy France maintain the claim made by its Catholic fascist leaders Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval: state collaboration was supposed to protect the French civilian population from the Occupation's hardships. At his trial, Pétain said that Charles de Gaulle had represented the \"sword\" of France, and Pétain had been the \"shield\" protecting France. ==Academic views== ===Kim Munholland=== Kim Munholland (1934‒2020) reported in 1994 a widespread consensus among historians on Vichy French authoritarianism and its ===Robert Paxton=== American historian Robert Paxton (1932 ‒ ) said:L'Humanité, 1 November 1997, Robert Paxton donne une accablante leçon d'histoire (Robert Paxton gives a damning lesson of history) and Robert Paxton: History Lesson. Retrieved August 29, 2016.] ===Susan Zuccotti=== American historian Susan Zuccotti (1940 ‒ ) said that the Vichy regime facilitated the deportation of foreign Jews, rather than French Jews, until at least 1943:Susan Zuccotti, The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews. University of Nebraska Press, 1999, pp. 168–169. Deportations from France started in summer 1942, several months after mass deportation from other countries had started. Whatever the Vichy government's initial or subsequent intent, the death rate was 15% for French Jews, slightly over half of that of non-citizen Jews residing in France.François Delpech, Historiens et Géographes, no 273, mai–juin 1979, ==Beyond France== A trend of Holocaust denial similar to the phenomenon of Vichy syndrome, some state-sponsored, is also seen in other European countries, including Austria, Croatia, * * * * * Czechia, Hungary, * * * Germany, Italy, Poland, * Robert Rozett, “Competitive Victimhood and Holocaust Distortion,” The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, XVI (2022); “Distorting the Holocaust and Whitewashing History: Toward a Typology,” XIII: 1 (2019); Yehuda Bauer, “Creating a “Usable” Past: On Holocaust Denial and Distortion,” XIV: 2 (2022); and Jan Grabowski, “The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'” X: 3 (2016). * Joanna Beata Michlic, “The Politics of the Memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland: Reflections on the Current Misuses of the History of Rescue,” Jewish Historical Studies—Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England, LIII: 1 (2022); Piotr Forecki, Po Jedwabnem: Anatomia pamięci funkcjonalnej (Kraków, 2018); Jan Gross, Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne (Princeton, 2001). * Piotr Forecki, “Domestic ‘Assassins of Memory’: Various Faces of Holocaust Revisionism in Contemporary Poland,” presentation at a symposium in honor of Professor Antony Polonsky called “The Holocaust in Eastern Europe: sources, memory, politics,” March 16, 2021, UCL, London. * * Antony Polonsky and Joanna Beata Michlic (eds.), The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland (Princeton, 2009) and Laurence Weinbaum, “Amnesia and Antisemitism in the ‘Second Jagiellonian Age,’” Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and Delegitimizing Israel, Robert Wistrich (ed.)

It is reportedly led by the Slovenian Democratic Party and The New Slovenia. These parties draw support from traditionalist Catholics. ====Leon Rupnik's grandson==== Leon Rupnik's grandson petitioned to challenge the 1946 conviction of his grandfather. His petition unexpectedly succeeded in January 2020, when the Slovenian Supreme Court cancelled the 1946 conviction on \"procedural grounds\". * * * * * The cancellation was condemned by Jewish groups worldwide, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which noted: Ljubljana's Jewish Cultural Centre also condemned the cancellation: > [...] It is our assessment that we are witnessing the first step in a > politically motivated ambition to rehabilitate the criminal collaborationist > regime in Slovenia during WWII whose “president” was the aforementioned Leon > Rupnik, and who was justly tried and sentenced to death as a war criminal, > and whom even the pre-war Yugoslav Royal Government, then in exile, > renounced as a traitor. [...] ====Slovenian Catholic Church==== The history of Slovenian‒Nazi collaboration has become a polarized topic in Slovenian society, with the pro-Rupnik side backed by the Slovenian Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, along with conservative parties and revisionist historians, often accused others of \"justifying totalitarian Communist dictatorship\" for rejecting Rupnik's antisemitic legacy. Apart from beatifying the pro-Ustaše Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac, the Catholic Church has tried rehabilitating Bishop Gregorij Rožman, despite his antisemitism and Nazi collaboration. * * Tamara Griesser Pečar, Razdvojeni narod.
