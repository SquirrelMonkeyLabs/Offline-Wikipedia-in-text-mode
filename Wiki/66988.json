 "text": "Vinca (from Latin vincire \"to bind, fetter\") is a genus of five species in the family Apocynaceae, that grows in Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia. The common name, shared with the related genus Catharanthus, is Periwinkle. They are subshrubs or herbaceous, and have slender stems 1–2 m (3–6 feet) long but not growing more than 20–70 cm (8-30 inches) above ground; the stems frequently take root where they touch the ground, so the plant can spread widely ==References== *Blamey, M., & Grey-Wilson, C.
