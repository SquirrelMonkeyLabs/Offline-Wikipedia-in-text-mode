 "text": "Danilo I (25 May 1826 13 August 1860) was the first secular Prince of Montenegro from 1851 until his assassination in 1860. He was the third shortest ruling king of Montenegro. He fought a war against the Ottomans in 1852. He also defeated them in Ostrog in 1853 and in Grahovac 1858. The city Danilovgrad is named after him. ==Rise to power== When Petar II Petrović- Njegoš died, the Senate named his older brother Pero Tomov as Prince, not bishop. However, Pero lost to the younger Danilo, who had more support from the people. Before becoming leader, Danilo made peace between two tribes and gained support from most Montenegrin clans. He traveled to Vienna and Russia, supposedly to become Vladika. In 1852, Danilo returned with the backing of Russian Emperor Nicholas I to become Prince. Pero accepted defeat and returned to his Senate role. Danilo became the first secular Prince of Montenegro, not holding the title of Vladika. He planned to make Montenegro a kingdom but died before he could do so. ==Military career== During Danilo's reign, Montenegro won a key victory over Turkey. His brother, Mirko Petrović-Njegoš, led 7,500 soldiers to defeat 7,000 to 13,000 Turks in the Battle of Grahovac on May 1, 1858. This victory helped Montenegro gain independence. The battle was celebrated, especially by Serbs in Vojvodina. It forced the Great Powers to set the border between Montenegro and Turkey, officially recognizing Montenegro's independence. Montenegro also gained several new territories. ==Death== Danilo was assassinated in August 1860 at the port of Kotor by Todor Kadić from the Bjelopavlići clan. After his death, his nephew, Prince Nikola, became the new Prince of Montenegro. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Montenegrin people Category:Monarchs in Europe Category:19th-century monarchs in Europe",
