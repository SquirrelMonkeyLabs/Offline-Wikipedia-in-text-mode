 "text": "The Paria collared frog (Mannophryne venezuelensis) is a frog. It lives in the Serranía de Ziruma in Falcón and Zulia in Venezuela. ==Body== The adult male frog is 19.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 21.5 mm long. It has a pattern on its back. It has light brown color on the bottoms of all four feet. It has soms stripes near where the back legs meet the body. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains. When the weather is wet and there is water in the air, the frog will go far from the streams. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. The place where the frog lives touches one protected park: Península de Paria National Park. ==Young== The male frogs sit on rocks next to streams and call to the female frogs during the day. Scientists think the frog has young the same way as other frogs in Mannophryne: The female frog lays eggs on land, and, after the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. Scientists saw male frogs carrying 7-10 tadpoles on their backs. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms for cocoa and food to eat and to get wood to build with. Forest fires also hurt the frogs. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also kill the frogs, but they have not looked for the fungus in this place yet. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
