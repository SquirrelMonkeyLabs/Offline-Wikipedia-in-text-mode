 "text": "The statue of Alfred the Great in Southwark may be London's oldest outdoor statue. The lower part is from a Roman statue (late 1st or early 2nd century AD). The top is in late 18th or early 19th-century stone in mediaeval style. The statue is in the centre of Trinity Church Square in Southwark. It is high and shows a broad-shouldered, bearded man wearing robes and a crown. It may show the 9th-century Anglo-Saxon king Alfred the Great. The statue now stands in the open air, but the back of the statue is quite plain. It may originally have stood in a niche. == References == Category:Statues Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Southwark Category:18th-century works",
