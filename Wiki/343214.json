The name Salzkammergut means \"Estate of the Salt Chamber\". This is from the Imperial Salt Chamber, the group who ran the precious salt mines in the Habsburg empire. With its many lakes and mountains, the Salzkammergut has many opportunities for water sports, bathing, hiking, cycling and golf. Parts of the area around Hallstatt were listed as a World Heritage Site in 1997.
