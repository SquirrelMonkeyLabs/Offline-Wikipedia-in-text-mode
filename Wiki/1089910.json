 "text": "The Qassam rocket is a missile created by the military wing of the Hamas movement, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. The rockets cannot be fired near civilian areas and especially not in huge population centers. Since 2001 when the first Qassam rocket was made, there have been 3 different models of the Qassam rocket. Rockets for other militant groups in Palestine are also called Qassams by the Israeli media. == References == Category:Gaza Strip Category:Fatah Category:Hamas Category:Missiles Category:Rockets",
