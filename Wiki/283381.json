 "text": "Kid A is the fourth album by the band Radiohead. It was released in October 2000 on the Parlophone label. It was a success, and was certified platinum in the United Kingdom after only one week. Kid A was the band's first number one in America, and was named as 'The best album of the 2000s' by Rolling Stone magazine. == Reception == At first, many people did not like Kid A. They wanted an album that had the rock sound of The Bends and OK Computer, but Kid A had electronic music. Melody Maker gave the album a very bad review, and criticized the album for being depressing and having electronic music. However, Pitchfork Media, who gave Radiohead's last album a perfect score, did the same for Kid A. The review raved about how good the album was. The review, infamous for its metaphors and storytelling, is now famous among Radiohead fans. Thanks to the Pitchfork review, people love Kid A now. It has been referred to as a \"classic\". Critics have praised the album's relevance in computerized society. Some think that the bad reviews for the album were rockist, which is when someone favors rock music over other genres. == Track listing == All tracks written by Radiohead except where noted. # \"Everything in Its Right Place\" – 4:11 # \"Kid A\" – 4:44 # \"The National Anthem\" – 5:51 # \"How to Disappear Completely\" – 5:56 # \"Treefingers\" – 3:42 # \"Optimistic\" – 5:15 # \"In Limbo\" – 3:31 # \"Idioteque\" (Radiohead, Paul Lansky) – 5:09 # \"Morning Bell\" – 4:35 # \"Motion Picture Soundtrack\" (includes a hidden track that starts at 4:18) – 7:01 ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:Radiohead albums",
