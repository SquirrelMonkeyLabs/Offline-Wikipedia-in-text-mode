 "text": "The United States Capitol shooting incident of 1954 was an attack on March 1, 1954, by four Puerto Rican nationalists; they shot 30 rounds from semi- automatic pistols from the Ladies' Gallery (a balcony for visitors) of the House of Representatives chamber in the United States Capitol. They did this to support Puerto Rican independence from American rule. The people responsible for the attack were Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores Rodríguez. The shooting began at Representatives in the 83rd Congress, who were debating an immigration bill. Five Representatives were wounded, one seriously, but all recovered. The assailants were arrested, tried and convicted in federal court, and given long sentences. In 1978 and 1979, they were pardoned by President Jimmy Carter; all four returned to Puerto Rico. ==References== Category:20th century in Washington, D.C.
