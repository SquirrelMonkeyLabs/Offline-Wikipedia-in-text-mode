 "text": "In the early 1800s, the First Saudi state , led by Saud bin Abdulaziz, sought to expand its influence over the eastern Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. Following Wahhabi doctrine, the Saudis viewed Shi’a communities, especially in Bahrain and Qatif, as heretical. This provided both religious and strategic justification to invade Bahrain, which was then ruled by the Al Khalifa family after they had expelled Persian forces in 1783. Although Bahrain was largely independent, it maintained some ties with Persia and other Gulf emirates. Its Shia population and economic importance made it a prime target for Saudi expansion ==The Invasion== In 1800, Wahhabi forces launched raids on Bahrain from the mainland via Qatif and the coast of Al-Ahsa By 1801–1802, the Saudis managed to impose religious authority over parts of Bahrain, pressuring the Al Khalifa rulers to accept Wahhabi missionaries and doctrine The Saudis temporarily asserted religious and political control, though they did not establish a lasting military occupation. ==Aftermath== The Al Khalifa sought external help and eventually allied with the British and Omani powers to repel further Saudi influence. By 1809, after the beginning of British intervention in the Gulf, Saudi control was rolled back. The Saudis would later lose influence entirely after the fall of Diriyah in 1818 to the Egyptian-Ottoman campaign. == References == * Commins, David. *The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia*. I.B.
