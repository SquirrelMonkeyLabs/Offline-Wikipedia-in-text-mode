 "text": "Santa Cruz High School (Liceo Santa Cruz) is a public high school in Santa Cruz, Chile. == History == On August 2, 1963 the Men's High School of Santa Cruz was created. Adriano Díaz donated land where the high school was going to be constructed. However, a sport complex was constructed there instead. The high school opened on March 1, 1964 in an old house. It had at least 170 students. Many of these students already had finished their first or second grade in Humanities in the Pedro Aguirre Cerda High School, but it was not recognized officially. The first principal was Osvaldo Castillo, who hired teachers. Almost all of the teachers had worked in the Pedro Aguirre High School. A logo and a standard were designed. Both included palm trees, which were common in the city. The anthem of the high school was composed by Raúl Benavides. == References == * Category:Schools in Chile Category:O'Higgins Region",
