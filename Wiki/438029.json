 "text": "Boiler feedwater is the water used to \"feed\" or supply a boiler to produce steam or hot water. At Thermal power stations the feedwater is usually preheated and conditioned.Kenneth E. Heselton, Boiler Operator's Handbook (Lilburn, GA: Fairmont Press; New York: M. Dekker, 2005), p. 175 It is kept in a storage tank before being pumped to the boiler. The feedwater must be specially treated to avoid problems in the boiler. Untreated boiler feed water can cause corrosion and scaling. Most boiler systems use some form of water purification to treat feedwater.Edmund Wehrenfennig; Fritz Wehrenfennig; Duncan White Patterson, The analysis and softening of boiler feed-water (New York: J. Wiley & Sons, 1906), p. 8 == References == Category:Fluid mechanics",
