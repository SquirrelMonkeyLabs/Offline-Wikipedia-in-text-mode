 "text": "Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that started in Europe toward the end of the 18th century. The beginning of this period is usually located in 1798, with the publication of William Wordsworth's and Samuel Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads. The crowning of Queen Victoria in 1837 is accepted as its end. Romanticism arrived in other parts of the English- speaking world later. For example, it arrived around 1820 to the United States.
