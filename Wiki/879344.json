 "text": "On 24 October 2021, the Sudanese military caused a coup against the government in Khartoum. At least five senior government figures were arrested, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The coup also caused internet outages in the country. An unsuccessful coup happened in September 2021. Later that day, Head of State Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared a state of emergency and announced the dissolution of the government and the Sovereignty Council. In a televised address, he stated that a new government would lead the country until the next elections, which will be held in July 2023. A month later on 21 November, a deal was made in which all political prisoners including Hamdok were released with Hamdok becoming prime minister again. ==Related pages== *2019 Sudanese coup d'état ==References== Category:2021 in Africa Category:Coups d'état October 2021 coup d'etat Category:Khartoum Category:October 2021 events Category:November 2021 events",
