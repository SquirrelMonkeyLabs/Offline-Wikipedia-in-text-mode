 "text": "Windburn is when a person gets a sunburn but thought it was caused by wind because it was cloudy. Windburn is actually a sunburn rather than an actual condition caused by wind. This was shown as early as 1936 by English skin specialist Charles Howard White of Cambridge and American physicist William Henry Crew of New York University. However, it is still a common misconception that windburn is caused by wind. == Reference == Category:Medical education",
