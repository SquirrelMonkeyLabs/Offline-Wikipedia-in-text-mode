 "text": "A prisoner exchange and peace treaty to end the Israel–Hamas war was agreed to by Israel and Hamas on 15 January 2025. The deal was first created by mediators from Egypt and Qatar on 5 May 2024, and supported by Hamas on 6 May 2024. On 31 May 2024, U.S. president Joe Biden presented a similar proposal. By January 2025, a similar proposal had reportedly been agreed to by Israel and Hamas. The proposal is the first in three stages, beginning with a six- week ceasefire, the release of all Israelis being held in Gaza in exchange for some of the Palestinians being held by Israel, a permanent ceasefire, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, and a reconstruction process lasting from three to five years. On January 15, 2025, after news of a ceasefire agreement, Palestinians in Gaza broke out into celebrations. ==References== Category:May 2024 events Category:January 2025 events Category:Israel–Hamas war Category:Ceasefires",
