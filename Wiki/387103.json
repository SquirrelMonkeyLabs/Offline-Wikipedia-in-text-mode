 "text": "Mitochondrial Eve is a term from genetics and human evolution. It refers to a woman, whose mitochondrial DNA is a parent of all living humans. To put this more exactly, she is the female most recent common ancestor of all humans alive at present. == How this is decided == Rather than use full DNA comparisons, two simpler methods are used: *Y-chromosome DNA *Mitochondrial DNA This gives haplogroups (a haplogroup is a combination of genes on different chromosomal regions that are closely linked and tend to be inherited together). == The results == According to current research, Mitochondrial Eve lived about 200.000 years ago. University of Leeds - New ‘molecular clock’ aids dating of human migration history Most likely she lived in East Africa,'Your Genetic Journey' - The Genographic Project when Homo sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern humans) were developing as a population distinct from other human sub-species. Mitochondrial Eve lived later than Homo heidelbergensis and the emergence of Homo neanderthalensis, but earlier than the out of Africa migration. The dating for 'Eve' was a blow to the multiregional hypothesis, and a boost to the hypothesis that modern humans originated relatively recently in Africa and spread from there, replacing more \"archaic\" human populations such as Neanderthals. As a result, the latter hypothesis became dominant. ==References== Category:Genetics Category:Origin hypotheses of ethnic groups Category:Humans",
