 "text": "Babes in Arms is a 1939 musical movie starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. It was directed by Busby Berkeley. The movie is about the children of vaudeville performers who want to prove to their elders that they can sing and dance on Broadway. It is based on the 1937 Broadway musical of the same name by Richard Rodgers and Moss Hart. Most of the original music was cut for the movie. The song \"Good Morning\" by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown was written for the movie and was later featured in the Gene Kelly movie Singin' in the Rain. A new finale called \"God's Country\" was prepared for the movie. Garland and Rooney parodied Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor in a segment called \"My Day\". The segment was removed when Roosevelt died in 1945. Babes in Arms was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Mickey Rooney) and Best Music, Scoring (Roger Edens and Georgie Stoll). ==Other websites== * * * * * Babes in Arms on Screen Guild Theater: November 9, 1941 Category:American musical comedy movies Category:1939 movies Category:1939 romantic comedy movies Category:MGM movies Category:Movies directed by Busby Berkeley Category:American teen comedy movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:American teen romance movies",
