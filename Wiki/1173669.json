 "text": "Florentino Torres High School, commonly known as Torres High School, situated in Tondo, Manila, Philippines, is one of the oldest public high schools in the city. ==History== In 1921, the Manila city government mandated secondary schools in each of its four districts: Manila North High School, Manila South High School, Manila East High School, and Manila West High School. * In 1925, an American educator named James T. Burns founded Legarda High School with only three teachers. Burns opened his school to students who were refused admission by the three existing public high schools in Manila. * In 1926, Legarda High School moved location, to the Sequoia Building at the foot of Pritil Bridge in Tondo and was renamed Manila West High School. * In June 1930, the schools in each Manila quadrant were renamed after jurists; Cayetano Arellano (North), Manuel Araullo (South), Victorino Mapa (East) â€” and Florentino Torres (West), therefore becoming Florentino Torres High School. ==References== Category:High schools in the Philippines Category:Education in the Philippines",
