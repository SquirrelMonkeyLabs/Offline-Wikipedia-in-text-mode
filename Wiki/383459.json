 "text": "Hydra is a constellation that has parts in the northern sky and parts in the southern sky. It is the biggest constellation. It represents a water snake. The astronomer named Ptolemy listed Hydra when he made a list of 48 constellations. It is also one of the 88 modern constellations that were made by the International Astronomical Union. Even though Hydra is a very big constellation, it only has one bright star. This star is named Alphard. Alphard means \"the solitary one\" in Arabic. Hydra actually has little to identify it exept for a cluster of stars at its head. == References == Category:Constellations Category:Constellations listed by Ptolemy",
