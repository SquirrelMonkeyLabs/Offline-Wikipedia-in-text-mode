 "text": "Cetotherium (meaning \"whale beast\") was a genus of baleen whale from the family Cetotheriidae. It lived during the Miocene and Pliocene. == Description == Cetotherium riabini possibly followed a generalized feeding strategy combining continuous suction feeding with intermittent suction feeding. == Taxonomy == The Cetotheriidae and this genus have been used as wastebasket taxa for all baleen whale types. This family was thought to have been long gone during the Pliocene, up until 2012, where scientists recovered the pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata) as the only survivor. === Formerly assigned species === This is a list of species that have probably got moved to another genus or removed from Cetotherium: * Cetotherium furlongi * Cetotherium gastaldii (now type species of the genus Eschrichtioides) * Cetotherium klinderi * Cetotherium maicopicum * Cetotherium mayeri (reassigned to the genus Mithridatocetus, nomen dubium) == Evolution == During the Oligocene period, the cetotheres started to emerge. From an evolutionary perspective, they share some characteristics of the Balaenopteridae and Eschrichtiidae. == Gallery == File:Cetotherium riabinini skull.jpg|C. riabinini skull File:Cetotherium riabinini.jpg|Model of C. riabinini == References == == Other websites == * https://www.gbif.org/species/4970908 Category:Baleen whales Category:Miocene Category:Animals of North America Category:Cetaceans Category:Whales",
