 "text": "Alsodes neuquensis is a frog. It lives in Argentina. ==Home== This frog lives in lakes in places high in the hills where there are no trees and in streams on volcanic flat, high places. It can live in places that cows or horses have changed a little. People also found it on pine tree farms. Scientists have seen the frog between 1500 and 2100 meters above sea level. This frog lives in two protected places, Batea Mahuida Reserve and Copahue Reserve. Scientists think it could also live in Lan√≠n National Park. ==Young== This frog lays eggs in streams and ponds. This animal lives as a tadpole for one or two years before becoming a frog. Tadpoles from different years swim in the same places. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Volcanoes, fires, human beings' animals, and animals that human beings brought from other places, for example trout fish, can harm this frog or its home. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
