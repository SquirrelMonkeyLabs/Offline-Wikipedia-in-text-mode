 "text": "Platonic crystals are periodic structures which are designed to guide flexural wave energy through thin elastic plates. The study of platonic crystals is referred to as platonics and does not refer to the teachings of Plato or the Platonic solids. Platonic crystals are also named after plate, not Plato. The term is now used very commonly by many research groups in Australia, New Zealand, France, and the United Kingdom. Category:Physics",
