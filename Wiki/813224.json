 "text": "The term dyke is a slang term. It is used as a noun for lesbians. It is also used as an adjective for things related to lesbianism. It began as a homophobic and misogynistic term on par with the word faggot, Dyke means a masculine or manly girl or woman. ==Origin== The origin of the term dyke is obscure. Many theories have come out. Most theories tell that dyke comes off the word bulldyke, which has a similar meaning. ==History== From the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, dike had been American slang for the well- dressed man. Diked out and out on the dike meant a young man was in his best clothes. The word dyke was used in the 1950s as a derogatory term for lesbians by straight people. But it was also used by lesbians of higher social status to mean crude and rough-bar lesbians. ==Facebook controversy== Facebook censored use of the word dyke as \"abusive content\" in June 2017 on its website. The decision triggered a Change.org protest petition created by the Listening 2 Lesbians collective. It was signed by 7,247 supporters. Dyke Marches have become popular gay pride events in the United States and Canada. They also happen in Europe, including London and Berlin, as well as across Mexico. ==References== Category:Slurs Category:Gay slang Category:Homophobia Category:Pejoratives Category:English profanity Category:LGBT in the United States Category:LGBT in the United Kingdom",
