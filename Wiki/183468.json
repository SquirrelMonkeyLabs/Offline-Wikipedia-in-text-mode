 "text": "Methanol, or methyl alcohol, is the simplest alcohol: CH3OH. It has similarities to ethanol (the alcohol humans drink) but is very toxic. The toxicity takes hours, however, so antidotes can prevent the damage such as permanent blindness or death. Methanol is used as fuel additive, as a solvent, and in the chemical industry. It is sometimes called \"wood alcohol\" because it was formerly made from wood. Methanol is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor that is very similar to that of ethanol (drinking alcohol). Category:Biofuels 1 Category:Alcohol solvents",
