 "text": "Folkhemmet (literally, People's Home) is a political term in Swedish. It was first used by Rudolf Kjellén in the early 20th century. It was adopted by the Swedish Social Democratic Party in the 1920s. On 18 January 1928, Swedish social democrat Per Albin Hansson delivered a speech including the word. His meaning referred to equality and cooperation. The speech made the term popular. Nowadays the term may not only refer to Per Albin Hansson's visions but also works as a poetic name for the Swedish welfare state. ==Popular culture== *Magnus Uggla recorded the album Välkommen till folkhemmet in 1983. ==References== Category:20th century in Sweden Category:Politics of Sweden",
