 "text": "The WAGR G class were a total of 48 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1889 to the 1960s. The wheel arrangement of the G class were originally 2-6-0s for the first 24 engines, however, the later 24 were built as 4-6-0s. The G class entered service between 1889 to 1899 both as new and second-hand, the design was almost identical to other government railways' such as the Tasmanian Government Railways C class, South Australian Railways Y class and also used in Queensland, and the Northern Territory on the North Australia Railway during the second world war, with 13 being loaned to the Commonwealth Railways, becoming the Nfc and Nga classes. The design was also popular for timber mill operations around Western Australia. Withdrawals began in the 1960s, though No. 123 is still owned by Transwa (the successor to the WAGR). Five of the G class are preserved, those being No. 53, 117, 118, 123, and No. 233 which is operational at the South West Rail and Heritage Centre in Boyanup, and is named Leschenault Lady. Locomotives of identical design used by timberlines are also preserved. ==References== ===Notes=== Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
