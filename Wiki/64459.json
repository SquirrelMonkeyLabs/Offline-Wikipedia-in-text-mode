The emerald is one of the most valuable gems, along with the ruby, the opal, topaz, the diamond, and a sapphire. == Etymology == The word emerald comes from Vulgar Latin. The word was Esmaralda/Esmaraldus, a different way of saying the Latin word Smaragdus, which came from the Greek, (smaragdos; \"green gem\"). It first came from a Semitic word, izmargad (). This meant \"emerald\" or \"green\". The name could also be related to the Semitic word baraq (בָּרָק ;البُراق; \"lightning\" or \"shine\") (c.f. bareqeth and , barq, \"lightning\"). It is where the Persian ( zomorrod), Turkish (), Sanskrit ( maragdam) and Russian (; izumrúd) words came from. ==Related pages== * List of minerals * Emerald (color) == References == Category:Gemstones Category:Birthstones Category:Beryl",
