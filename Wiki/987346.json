 "text": "Nanda (also known as Mandaladhish Nanda Rai or Nanda Baba), according to the Harivamsha and the Puranas, was the head of the Gopas tribe of cowherds referred as Holy Gwals. Nanda was not a Kshatriya or a King but is popularly known as the foster-father of Krishna. Nandvanshi Ahirs are descendants of Nanda. Nanda was the Chief or Mandaladhish of Gokul Mandal that was one of the most powerful Divisional area of ancient rulers. Nanda was not a brother or cousin of King Vasudeva. Vasudeva, took his new-born son Krishna to Nanda on the night of the child's birth so that Nanda could raise him. Nanda, who was married to Yasoda, brought up both Krishna and Balarama. Krishna derives his name Nandanandana (meaning son of Nanda) from him. ==References== Category:Hindu mythology Category:Mahabharata",
