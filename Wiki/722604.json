 "text": "The strawberry poison-dart frog (Oophaga pumilio, formerly Dendrobates pumilio) is a small poison-dart frog found in Central America. It is common throughout its range, from eastern central Nicaragua through Costa Rica and northwestern Panama. The frog is often found in humid lowlands and premontane forest. Large numbers are also found in disturbed areas such as plantations.Savage, J. M. 2002. The Amphibians and Reptiles of Costa Rica. University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London. The strawberry poison-dart frog is famous for its widespread color variation. There are about 15-30 color morphs, most of which may be true breeding.Summers K; Cronin T.W. & Kennedy T. 2003. Variation in spectral reflectance among population of Dendrobates pumilio, the strawberry poison frog, in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama. Journal of Biogeography. 30 35â€“53. O. pumilio is not the most poisonous of the dendrobatids, but it is the most toxic member of its genus. == References == Category:Poison dart frogs",
