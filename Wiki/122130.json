 "text": "4chan is an English language website based on the Japanese Futaba Channel where people can post and discuss pictures and other images. These types of sites are called imageboards. It was started in 2003 by Christopher Poole, known as \"moot\" online, who was 15 years old at the time. On the website, users post pictures and discuss them. When the site started, it was for discussing anime and manga, but now many other topics are discussed. One of the boards on the site, called \"/b/\", is dedicated to random topics and is often mentioned in media. Several Internet memes have started at 4chan, including lolcats and rickrolling. People have associated it with the alt- right, neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers, as well as those part of the Red-Brown coalition, due to there being sections devoted to them. == References == == Other websites == * Category:American websites",
