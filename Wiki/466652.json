The recording had a male voice believed to be Collins. The person on the recording admitted to past sexual abuse of a child. In 1983, two girls stated that they were \"touched\" by Collins. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Collins had been investigated by the department in 2012. That investigation happened after LAPD received a claim from forty years earlier regarding sexual abuse. The LAPD said they were not able to prove that the claim was true. ==Other websites== * Official website * Stephen Collins cast bio on The CW * * * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:Writers from Des Moines, Iowa Category:Actors from Des Moines, Iowa",
