 "text": "Richard Girnt Butler (February 23, 1918 - September 8, 2004) was a white supremacist and American Christian religious leader. Butler founded the neo- Nazi Aryan Nations and would become one of the most well known and influential leaders of the American far-right. Butler was a former member of the Silver Shirts, an American fascist organization modeled after Nazi Brownshirts and active until its suppression following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Butler was convicted of conspiracy by the United States Department of Justice, but was not convicted because the grand jury failed to prosecute him.Biography of \"Louis Beam\" at Anti-Defamation League (ADL) website. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Deaths from congestive heart failure Category:People from Denver Category:American Christians Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Writers from Colorado Category:Writers from Idaho Category:Military people from Colorado",
