 "text": "Scrooge McDuck or Uncle Scrooge, is a fictional character first appearing in the Disney comic book Christmas on Bear Mountain. The character was created by Carl Barks and has appeared in many comic books, television shows (most notably in his own animated television series DuckTales) movies, and video games. Since 1952 Scrooge McDuck has appeared in his own comic book series, called Uncle Scrooge. He is partially based on the fictional character Ebenezer Scrooge, from Charles Dickens' novel, A Christmas Carol and on the real Scottish-born American businessman Andrew Carnegie, whose life story resembles that of Scrooge McDuck. Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, the son of Fergus McDuck. His family is very poor, so Scrooge emigrates to USA where he finds gold and becomes rich. In 1902 he moves to Duckburg and builds the Money Bin on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg. Over the next years, Scrooge travels the world, learning about many cultures. In 1930, Scrooge became the richest duck on Earth. In 1942, Scrooge retires and buys a mansion called the Manor McDuck. In 1947, he invites his nephew Donald Duck and his grand-nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to spend Christmas at his mansion. His main enemies include the criminal gang called the Beagle Boys who keep trying to steal Scrooge's money, and Flintheart Glomgold, the second richest duck in the world, who tries to destroy Scrooge's wealth and become the richest duck in the world. Despite his huge wealth, Scrooge does not like to spend his money, and instead likes to swim in his \"Money Bin\" full of gold coins. Although he is well-meaning and cares about his relatives and other people, he reluctantly gives allowance to his grand-nephews, with the condition that they spend it wisely. ==References== Category:Fictional characters introduced in the 1940s Category:Fictional ducks Category:Disney characters",
