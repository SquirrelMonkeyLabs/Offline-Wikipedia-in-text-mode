It was also the site of the recent discovery of a bag which had been lost in the Second World War by a dispatch rider (Alec Ross) of the Long Range Desert Group, part of the British Army. This contained the rider's personal letters and photographs, and had been well preserved. ==Petroglyphs== The Gilf Kebir is known for its prehistoric (Neolithic) petroglyphs * Karkur Talh and Karkur Murr: major eastern valleys of the Uweinat contain one of the richest concentrations of rock art in the whole Sahara. * Western Uweinat: Shelters under the huge granite boulders in the western Uweinat contain numerous paintings, including the famous sites of Ain Doua. * Jebel Arkenu, Jebel Kissu & Yerguehda Hill, the lesser granite massifs around Uweinat have many smaller sites. * Mogharet el Kantara in the southern Gilf Kebir contains only one known rock art site, a cave discovered by Shaw & party in 1936. * Wadi Sora in the northwestern Gilf Kebir: the \"Cave of Swimmers\" (or Swimmers' Cave), discovered by the Hungarian Count László Almásy (The English Patient), plus many other paintings nearby. *The North-western half of the Gilf Kebir aside from Wadi Sora has only a few scattered engravings, of an apparently very ancient age. *In January 2003, Zarzora Expeditions and Jacopo Foggini independently announced the discovery of a major new rock art site in the Western Gilf Kebir (Foggini-Mestekawi Cave). ==Other websites== *google map *Libyan Rock Art Documentation Project *McOran E-Cards based on the 'Cave of Swimmers' *'WW11 Army Bag is found in Desert' Category:New Valley Governorate Category:Plateaus",
