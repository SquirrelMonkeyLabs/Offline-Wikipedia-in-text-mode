On March 9, 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, in a Nigerian citizen who had contact with the Italian citizen. On March 23, there were ten new cases: six in Lagos State, three in the FCT and one in Edo State. They also confirmed their first death, a 67-year-old Suleiman Achimugu. ==Economics== Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, and it has a large oil industry. It was hit hard when oil prices fell below zero in spring 2020 because of the pandemic. According to the World Data Lab, the coronavirus pandemic is bad for Africa's middle class. According to one economist from the Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank, a middle-class person is someone who is not rich but does have a steady income. One of the industries that has helped Africa's middle class rise over the past 30 years is tourism, and many countries closed borders and encouraged people not to travel. Experts say this is especially bad because a strong middle class lifts the whole country. ==Statistics== ===By states=== State Cases Active Recovered Deaths Lagos 22,562 1,223 21,119 220 FCT 6,385 369 5,934 82 Plateau 3,724 52 3,639 33 Oyo 3,693 406 3,242 45 Rivers 2,916 99 2,758 59 Kaduna 2,778 72 2,661 45 Edo 2,690 19 2,559 112 Ogun 2,103 78 1,994 31 Delta 1,823 37 1,737 49 Kano 1,768 24 1,690 54 Ondo 1,722 98 1,585 39 Enugu 1,332 21 1,290 21 Kwara 1,088 33 1,028 27 Ebonyi 1,055 6 1,019 30 Katsina 965 12 929 24 Osun 942 16 906 20 Gombe 938 56 857 25 Abia 926 9 908 9 Bauchi 750 16 720 14 Borno 745 4 705 36 Imo 648 23 613 12 Benue 493 22 460 11 Nasarawa 485 147 325 13 Bayelsa 426 23 382 21 Ekiti 346 13 327 6 Jigawa 325 6 308 11 Akwa Ibom 319 21 289 9 Niger 286 10 264 12 Anambra 285 1 265 19 Adamawa 261 4 238 19 Sokoto 165 – 148 17 Taraba 155 20 129 6 Kebbi 93 1 84 8 Yobe 92 13 71 8 Cross River 89 2 78 9 Zamfara 79 1 73 5 Kogi 5 – 3 2 Total 65,457 2,957 61,337 1,163 Note: Data as of 2020/11/17 23:00 WAT == Related pages == * COVID-19 pandemic in Africa ==References== == Other websites == * Nigeria Category:2020 in Nigeria Category:2021 in Nigeria Category:2022 in Nigeria",
