 "text": "John Michael Beaumont OBE (20 December 1927 â€“ 3 July 2016) was the twenty- second Seigneur of Sark in the Channel Islands. He worked as a civil engineer before replacing his paternal grandmother, Sibyl Hathaway, the 21st Dame of Sark, in 1974. During his rule, Beaumont saw the loss of many feudal rights enjoyed by the seigneurs, and was consequently often described as the \"last feudal baron\". ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from the Channel Islands",
