It flows north- west passing Gusau in Zamfara State, where the Gusau Dam forms a reservoir that supplies the city with water. The river enters Sokoto State where it passes by Sokoto city and is joined by the Rima River. It then turns south and flows through Birnin Kebbi in Kebbi State for about south of Birnin Kebbi.
