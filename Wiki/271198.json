At these tasks, he is assisted by Thongak Lairembi and Khamnung Kikoi Louonbi. The underworld kingdom is called \"Khamnung kingdom\" and its capital city, \"Khamnung Sawa\" is in the middle of the river \"Ashi Turel\", which has only a single bridge made up of a thread. This should be crossed over by only those souls who do not commit suicide during their earthly life.

In the time of the death, he stands over the dying one, and waiting for the man to see him. When the dying finally sees him, he drops a gall to the dying's mouth and that is what kills him finally The expression \"to taste of death\" originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall. ====Death and Satan==== The Angel of Death, who is identified by some with Satan, right after the creation has a dispute with God about the light of the Messiah. When Eve touched the tree of knowledge, the Angel of Death talked to her, and she thought:\"Now I shall die, and God will create another wife for Adam\". Adam also talked to the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death sits before the face of the dead. While Abraham was mourning, for Sarah the angel appeared to him, which explains why \"Abraham stood up from before his death\".
