The Sea of Marmara has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km),Sea of Marmara and its greatest depth is 1,370 m. ==Geography== The salinity of the Sea of Marmara averages about 22 parts per thousand, which is slightly greater than that of the Black Sea but only about two thirds that of most oceans and of the Mediterranean Sea. The water is much more saline at the bottom of the sea, with an average salinity of around 38 parts per thousand, whic is similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea. Water from the Susurluk, Biga (Granicus) and Gönen Rivers reduces the salinity of the sea. There are two major island groups: the Princes' and the Marmara Islands. The south coast of the sea includes the Gulf of Izmit, the Gulf of Gemlik and the Gulf of Erdek.
