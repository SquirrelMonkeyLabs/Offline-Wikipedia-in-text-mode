 "text": "Clash of the Titans was a concert tour that happened in September to October 1990 and May to July 1991. The main musicians for the tour were American thrash metal bands Slayer and Megadeth. The tour was made to help sell copies of the two bands' new albums, Rust in Peace and Seasons in the Abyss. The tour happened at two different times. The first was in Europe (with Testament and Suicidal Tendencies) and the second was in the United States (with Anthrax and Alice in Chains). Clash of the Titans is one of the most successful heavy metal tours ever. == References == Category:Concert tours",
