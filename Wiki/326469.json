Newsome is a former NFL tight end, who wore #82 with the Cleveland Browns. Newsome is the NFL's third all-time leading receiver for a tight end, with 662 career catches. Newsome retired as a player after the 1990 season Cleveland, but joined the Browns front office as an executive that same year. In 1996, the Browns became the Baltimore Ravens. Newsome quickly rose up the rankings under owner Art Modell. After the 2003 season, Modell, along with several other Ravens front office members, retired. This left many open spots. Newsome became the team's new general manager under new owner Steve Biscotti.

With Baltimore, Newsome signed Hall of Famers Mike Singletary, Shannon Sharpe, and Rod Woodson.
