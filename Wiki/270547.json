 "text": "FreeRice is a non-profit organization that donates rice to the hungry people around the world. Players choose an answer from a multiple-choice question. As the player gets more right answers, they advance in level. The highest level depends on the subject. ==Donation== In 2008, FreeRice became economically sufficient to donate 20 grains of rice per answer instead of 10. Unfortunately, the economic landslide of 2009 reduced the grains per answer back down to 10. ==Other websites== *Official Site Category:Non-profit organizations of Europe Category:Organizations based in Rome",
