 "text": "The cuboid bone is one of the seven tarsals of the feet. It is located on the side of the foot. It articulates (connects with) metatarsals number 4 and 5. Ligaments help hold the foot in an arched position and to hold the metatarsals and medial cuneiform bones (one of many is the cuboid) together. The bone also makes up part of the arch of the foot. Most likely, the name cuboid comes from the fact that the cuboid bone is shaped kind of like a cube. Cuboid syndrome can happen as a result of an injury to the cuboid bone. ==Related pages== *Phalanges *Metatarsals *Tarsals Category:Bones of the foot",
