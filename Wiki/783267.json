 "text": "A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an ice sheet or glacier. It is like a crevice that forms in rock. Crevasses form as a result of the movement caused by the shear stress between two semi-rigid pieces of ice. Crevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create seracs, arches, and other ice formations. ==References== Category:Geology",
