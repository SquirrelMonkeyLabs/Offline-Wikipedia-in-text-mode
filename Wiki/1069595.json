 "text": "The slogan of the Houthi movement (called Ansarallah officially), which is a Shiite Jihadist group in the country of Yemen says \"God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews, Victory to Islam\" on a vertical banner with a white background and green text for pro-Islam statements along with red text for the United States, Israel, and Jews. The slogan is modeled off of the motto of Iran during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The slogan was however made illegal by the government of Yemen (Saudi Arabia supported) and fierce crackdowns ensued causing the arrest of 600 people. The slogan is also typically used alongside the flags of Palestine and Yemen to show their support to the Palestinian people. == References == Category:National symbols of Yemen Category:Flags of Asia",
