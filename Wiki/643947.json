 "text": "The United States Space Force (USSF) is a part of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is focused on war in space. It is the sixth branch of the U.S. military. It is a part of the Department of the Air Force, one of the three parts of the Department of Defense. Because of this, the Space Force is led by the Secretary of the Air Force, who is under the Secretary of Defense. The leader of the Space Force is called the Chief of Space Operations. ==History== On June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump announced in an address to the National Space Council a directive that requests the creation of a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces. The president announced his intention for The Pentagon to create the 'Space Force' as an independent service branch, separate from the United States Air Force. Many US Senators stated they would rather create a Space Corps inside the Air Force. The Air Force has had a \"Space Command\" since September 1, 1982. Vice President Mike Pence in August 2018 announced a plan that would create the Space Force by 2020. General John W. Raymond was nominated to be commander of Space Command in April 2019, and his nomination was heard in the United States Senate in June 2019. He was previously head of U.S. Air Force Space Command. Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett approved the moving of part of the Air Force to the Space Force and making it the Space Operations Command. On 20 December 2019, the Space Force became the sixth armed service branch. General Raymond became the first Chief of Space Operations. This happened on 20 December 2019. ==Functions and duties== ===Functions=== The United States Space Force Act says that it will exist to make sure that the United States can operate freely in space. It ensures that they can conduct military actions in space quickly and for a long time. ===Duties=== Its duties are to protect the interests of the United States in space. It also prevents attacks on the United States in and from space, and to generally operate in space. ==Organization== The Space Force is one of two equal parts of the Department of the Air Force. The other one is the United States Air Force. Both are run by the Secretary of the Air Force. The leader of the Space Force is the Chief of Space Operations (CSO), who is a general. The Chief of Space Operations became a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in December 2020,one year after the Space Force Act was passed. About 16,000 Air Force members were intended to become part of the Space Force while the branch became part of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is making its own way of training members, and will create uniforms, ranks, logo, patch, awards, and an official song. This was supposed to happen within 18 months after the Space Force became independent. ===Structure=== Space Operations Command (SPOC), Vandenberg Space Force Base, California * 21st Space Wing (21 SW), Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado * 30th Space Wing (30 SW), Vandenberg Space Force Base, California * 45th Space Wing (45 SW), Patrick Space Force Base, Florida * 50th Space Wing (50 SW), Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado * 460th Space Wing (460 SW), Vandenberg Space Force Base, Colorado * 614th Air Operations Center (614 AOC), Vandenberg Space Force Base, California Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California * 61st Air Base Group (61 ABG), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California ==References== ==Other websites== * * Strategic Forces 115th Congress , Armed Service Republicans * * H.R.2810 — National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 — House version, United States Congress * S.1519 — National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 — Senate version, United States Congress * Final Report on Organizational and Management Structure for the National Security Space Components of the Department of Defense Category:Military of the United States Category:2019 establishments in the United States",
