New basal Iguanodonts from the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah and the evolution of thumb-spiked Dinosaurs. PLoS ONE 5, 11: e14075. PMID 21124919 This is a group of ornithopod families which some palaeontologists think are closely related: *Iguanodontidae *Camptosauridae *Dryosauridae *Hadrosauridae *Rhabdodontidae That is all the ornithopods except for the small, fast-running Hypsilophodon. This is placed in the family Hypsilophodontidae. However, the important reference work Vertebrate Paleontology is not yet in support of this trend, and lists the families separately as Ornithopods.Benton M.J. 2005. Vertebrate paleontology. 3rd ed, Blackwell Science, Oxford. The proposal is therefore still under discussion. == References == Category:Iguanodonts",
