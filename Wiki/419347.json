She is as talented as her father, who is also a painter. At that time in Italy, women were not allowed to paint humans in the nude. But Artemisia is very much determined. The movie got very positive reviews. The MPAA originally gave Artemisia an NC-17 rating. On appeal, the rating was changed to an R-rating.
