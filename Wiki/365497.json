 "text": "The assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, a United States Senator and brother of assassinated President John F. Kennedy, took place shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in Los Angeles after winning his campaign in California. Kennedy was shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died at the Good Samaritan Hospital not less than a day later. Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian immigrant, was guilty for Kennedy's murder and is now serving a life sentence for the assassination. As of 2011, Kennedy and Huey Long are the only U.S. Senators to be killed while in office. ==References== ==Other websites== * Mary Ferrell Foundation - RFK Assassination Documents â€“ LAPD and FBI investigation files and the trial transcript at the Mary Ferrell Foundation *FBI file on the RFK assassination Category:1968 in the United States Kennedy, Robert F Category:1960s in Los Angeles, California Category:Murder in the 1960s Category:Murders by firearm in California Category:Robert F.
