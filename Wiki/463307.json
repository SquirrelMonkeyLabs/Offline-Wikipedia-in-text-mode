 "text": "Quartering Act is the name given to two Acts of the British Parliament in the 18th century. These acts ordered the local governments of the American colonies to give British soldiers housing and food when they needed it. Each of the Quartering Acts was an amendment to the Mutiny Act. The Parliament renewed them each year.William Winthrop 1920. Military law and precedents. 2d ed, London: Government Printing Office, Quartering Act, p19/20. The Acts were passed to solve the problems of the French and Indian War. They caused tension between the Thirteen Colonies and the government in London. These problems led, in part, to the Revolutionary War. ==Notes== ==Other websites== * Text of the Act of 1765 * Text of the Act of 1774 Category:18th century in the United States Category:History of the United Kingdom",
