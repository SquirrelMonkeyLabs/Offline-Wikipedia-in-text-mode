 "text": "Primary care is the sort of healthcare people can use without having to be checked by someone first. It is generally not in hospitals. In most countries this means general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists. Emergency departments do not expect people to be checked out first. Physician assistants, physical therapists, or a nurse may expect people to be sent to them by a doctor in some places. If people are paying for their own treatment they may be able to go where they want, but in a public healthcare system there are usually more controls. In less developed countries people may be used to going to hospitals for all their problems. ==References== Category:Healthcare",
