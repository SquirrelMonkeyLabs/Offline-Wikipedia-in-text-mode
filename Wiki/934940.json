 "text": "The Alte Nationalgalerie (lit. Old National Gallery) is located on the Museum Island (Museuminsel) in Berlin. It is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The collection contains mainly work from the 19th century. It is part of a collection of six museums called the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery) and is the original location of the Nationalgalerie. The collection of the museum was first developed in 1815. Johann Heinrich Wagener donated the first couple hundred paintings to the gallery. The main architect of the building was Friedrich August Stüler. It was only after his death that the building was commissioned by the Prussian Kaiser in 1866. The shape of the building resembles a temple, theatre and church. The Museum opened in 1876. Although the museum was damaged during World War 2, the works were stored in bomb shelters. The museum was fully reconstructed between 1998 and 2001 and opened again in December 2001. With about 2000 works the gallery contains artpieces by Caspar David Friedrich, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Karl Blechen, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Adolph von Menzel, Max Liebermann, Lovis Corinth and others. Art movements included are Impressionist, Expressionist, Neoclassical, Romantic, Biedermeier and Modernism. Category:Museums in Berlin",
