 "text": "Leonard James \"Jim\" Callaghan, Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, (; 27 March 1912 – 26 March 2005) was a British Labour politician who served as the 48th Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) from 1976 to 1979. Born in the 1910s, Callaghan was an old-style socialist, lacking any higher education, and served as Member of Parliament (MP) for a Cardiff constituency. He is the only person to have held all three leading UK Cabinet positions (Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary), prior to their premiership. He was never expected to reach the premiership, having taken a back seat to the younger and more charismatic Harold Wilson for many years. However, when Wilson unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1976, Callaghan was the most experienced candidate to replace him. His time as prime minister was one of more open government but the electorate was dissatisfied with his relaxed response to high inflation and more industrial unrest, and replaced Labour with a Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. Callaghan resigned as Leader of the Labour Party 17 monthslater, but remained an MP for some years before being sent to the House of Lords as Baron Callaghan of Cardiff. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:1912 births Category:2005 deaths Category:British military personnel of World War II Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for Welsh constituencies Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Leaders of the Labour Party (UK) Category:Leaders of the Opposition (United Kingdom) Category:People from Portsmouth Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Secretaries of State for the Home Department Category:Secretaries of State of the United Kingdom Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 Category:UK MPs 1955–1959 Category:UK MPs 1959–1964 Category:UK MPs 1964–1966 Category:UK MPs 1966–1970 Category:UK MPs 1970–1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974–1979 Category:UK MPs 1979–1983 Category:UK MPs 1983–1987 Category:Labour Life Peers Category:Politicians from Hampshire Category:British trade unionists",
