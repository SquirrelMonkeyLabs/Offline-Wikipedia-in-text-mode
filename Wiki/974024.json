The adult male frog is about 26.3 - 30.0 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is green in color and the belly is whitish in color. Parts of the legs and toes are bright red. The iris of the eye is gold in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to build towns. Humans cut down trees for wood to use.
