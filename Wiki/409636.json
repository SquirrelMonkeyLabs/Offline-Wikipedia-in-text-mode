 "text": "Marianne [ mair-ee-an, mar- ] is a female given name. Marianne is a name that has been popular for many centuries and it combines two names, Mary and Anne. Mary is a Hebrew name that can mean \"bitter\" or \"beloved,\" while Anne is a Hebrew name that can mean \"grace\" or \"favor.\" When these two names are put together, Marianne means \"bitter grace\" or \"beloved grace.\" It is the French form of Mariamne, which in turn is a version of Mary. In the late Greek, Marianna was used. In 18th century France, Marianne became a popular version of the name Marian. People named Marianne include singer Marianne Faithfull. Fictional characters with the name include Marianne Dashwood in the book Sense and Sensibility.
