 "text": "Susannah Mushatt Jones (July 6, 1899 - May 12, 2016) was an American supercentenarian who was, at the age of 116, the world's oldest living person. Jones was the last living American person born in the 19th century. At the time of her death in May 2016, she was considered as the 3rd-oldest person ever from the United States, after Sarah Knauss and Lucy Hannah. After Hannah's age was debunked in 2020, it turned out that she was the 2nd-oldest person ever from the United States at the time of her death behind only Sarah Knauss. However, in April 2023, Delphia Welford (1875 - 1992) has been validated, so Jones was in fact the 3rd-oldest person ever from the United States. She has received tributes from the United States House of Representatives and from the Alabama House of Representatives \"for a remarkable lifetime of exceptional achievement lived during three centuries\". == References == Category:1899 births Category:2016 deaths Category:African- American supercentenarians Category:People from Alabama",
