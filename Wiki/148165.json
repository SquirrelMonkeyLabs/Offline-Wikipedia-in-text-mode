In January 2007, the song was used by Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles as part of an experiment to test out the new British singles chart rules that came into effect that month, which prompted the song to rise up the iTunes music charts, and reached number 17 in the singles chart on 21 January 2007 and number 11 in the download chart. ==Track listing== CD single 1 (SINCD8; Released ) #\"Honey to the Bee\" (Radio edit) – 3:59 #\"Call Me\" – 3:58 #\"What's Missing\" – 3:46 CD single 2 (SINDX8; Released ) #\"Honey to the Bee\" (Radio edit) – 3:59 #\"Honey to the Bee\" (Acoustic version) – 4:24 #\"Honey to the Bee\" (Delakota mix) – 5:00 #\"Honey to the Bee\" music video Category:1999 songs Category:Billie Piper songs Category:Pop songs",
