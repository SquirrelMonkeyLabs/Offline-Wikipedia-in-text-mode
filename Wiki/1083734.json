 "text": "A rainbow crossing or rainbow crosswalk is a pedestrian crossing with the rainbow flag on it, to represent the LGBT community. == History == The rainbow flag or gay pride flag, is linked with the LGBTQIA+ community and LGBT activities around the world. The idea of rainbow crosswalks first appeared in Taipei, Taiwan in 2008. The first permanent rainbow crosswalks were built in West Hollywood, as part of the 2012 Gay Pride Month. Similar crossings were built in Sydney, Australia, the following year, as well as some temporary rainbow crossings in other cities such as Tel Aviv. == References == Category:2013 in Australia Category:LGBT Category:Art",
