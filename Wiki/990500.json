 "text": "The \"Khatri Chhetri\" (K.C.) is a subgroup within the Chhetri community of Nepal. Essentially, they are Tagadhari Chhetri, descendants of a Brahmin father and a Khas mother. The Khatri subgroup includes more than 100 different sub-surnames, such as Bhattarai Khatri, Niraula Khatri, Poudel Khatri, Subedi Khatri, Gautam Khatri, Rijal Khatri, and so on. In the Karnali Province, Neupane Khatri and Acharya Khatri are the prominent Khatri groups. In the Lumbini Province, Gautam Khatri, Rijal Khatri, and Subedi Khatri are dominant. The Gandaki Province sees Poudel Khatri as the prominent Khatri subgroup. Moving to the eastern part of Nepal, you'll find Pudasaini Khatri and Humagain Khatri in the Bagmati Province. In the Koshi Province, Niraula Khatri and Dahal Khatri are dominant. == Language == The Chhetri are indigenous native speakers of the Nepali language, which is an Indo-Aryan language. The Khas people have been referred as Parbatiya, Pahari, or Gorkhali. The Khas make up about 31% of Nepal's population. However, the word “Khas” is not used much in modern times. The Khas usually call themselves by their group names, like Bahun and Kshetri. Category:Nepal Category:Ethnic groups in Asia",
