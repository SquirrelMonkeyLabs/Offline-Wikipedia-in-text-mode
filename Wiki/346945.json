Helmet became popular when they released their 1992 major-label debut Meantime, which peaked at number 68 on the Billboard 200 and featured their best known songs \"Unsung\" and \"In the Meantime\". Meantime is also Helmet's only album to go gold in the United States. They made two more albums before breaking up in 1998. However, Helmet reformed in 2004 and released a new album later that year. The album was called Size Matters and was their last release on their longtime label Interscope Records. Helmet was briefly signed to Warcon Records, who released their next album Monochrome in 2006, but today, they are signed to Work Song Records. That label released their latest album Seeing Eye Dog in 2010. ==Discography== So far, Helmet has released seven full-length studio albums, which include: * Strap It On (1990) * Meantime (1992) * Betty (1994) * Aftertaste (1997) * Size Matters (2004) * Monochrome (2006) * Seeing Eye Dog (2010) ==References== Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:Alternative metal bands Category:Post-hardcore bands Category:Musical groups from New York (state)",
