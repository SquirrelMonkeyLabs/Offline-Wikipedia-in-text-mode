 "text": "Elmo is a Muppet character from the TV show Sesame Street. He is a red monster and has his own part of the show called Elmo's World. He is three-and-a-half years old, and his birthday is on February 3. He is very famous for his laugh. His best friend is a pink fairy named Abby Cadabby. Elmo was originally a nameless extra performed by various puppeteers with no established identity. After that, he became a recurring character on the show. Brian Muehl was the first main performer and gave him a whispery voice. Richard Hunt performed him next and gave him a gruff voice. Then, Kevin Clash was given the Muppet in 1984 and used a new voice for him. This voice was made using falsetto. The Muppet then became very popular. Elmo always talks in the third person; for example, Elmo says, \"Elmo loves you!\" rather than \"I love you!\" Elmo has a pet fish named Dorothy. He plays the toy piano and likes to ride his tricycle. Elmo is very popular with younger children. In the 1990s, an Elmo toy called \"Tickle Me Elmo\" was sold. In a short time, it became one of the most popular Sesame Street toys in stores. ==References== Category:Sesame Street characters Category:Muppets",
