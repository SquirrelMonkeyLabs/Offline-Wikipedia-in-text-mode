 "text": "\"The Metamorphosis\" is a short story by Franz Kafka. It is about a young man named Gregor who wakes up from a nightmare and becomes an insect. Gregor becomes more and more like a bug and less and less like a human, and then he dies. The story was first published as \"Die Verwandlung\" in 1915. The original German version is only 70 pages long. It is the longest work of fiction that Kafka thought was complete that was published during his lifetime. Several movies were made from the story. It was also turned into an opera. == Other websites == Online editions * Die Verwandlung at DigBib.org (text, pdf, HTML) * The Metamorphosis , translated 2009 by Ian Johnston of Malaspina University- College, Nanaimo, BC * The Metamorphosis at The Kafka project, translated by Ian Johnston released to public domain * The Metamorphosis - Annotated text aligned to Common Core Standards * , translated by David Wyllie * * Lecture on The Metamorphosis by Vladimir Nabokov Commentary * Lesson on the difficulties of translating the story into English Related * Metamorphosis: The Game by Mito Studio, based on the story by Franz Kafka.
