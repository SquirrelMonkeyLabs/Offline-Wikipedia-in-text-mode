 "text": "Haflinger is an all-round breed of horse. It is a mountain horse but today people use it for spare time. A Haflinger counts as a pony breed of horse. The first cloned horse, Prometea is of this breed. A Haflinger has a gallant dry head with big eyes, wide-dilating nostrils, and small, attentive ears. People who raise this breed want them to have a good muscled body and a smart neck. ==References== * * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * Tyrolean Haflinger Breeding Association * American Haflinger Registry * Haflinger Society of Great Britain * Canadian Haflinger Association * Australian Haflinger Horse Breeders Association * Haflinger Horse Association New Zealand * Collaboration of Haflinger Breeders and Holders of Germany (AGH) Category:Horse breeds",
