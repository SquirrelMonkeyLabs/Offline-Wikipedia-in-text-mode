 "text": "Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2, also known as herpes zoster oticus, is a neurological disorder. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles). It typically manifests as a painful rash around the ear, face, mouth, and sometimes inside the ear canal. As well as the rash, people with Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 may have other symptoms. They could be facial paralysis (due to inflammation of the facial nerve), hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and difficulty with balance. These symptoms happen because the virus affects the facial nerve (also known as the seventh cranial nerve) and the vestibulocochlear nerve (the eighth cranial nerve). They are responsible for facial movement, sensation, and hearing. Treatment for Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 is often with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir. They help reduce the severity and duration of the infection. Corticosteroids may also be prescribed to reduce inflammation and swelling around the affected nerves. Medications for pain and management other symptoms may be recommended. People who might have Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 should seek medical attention quickly. Early treatment can help symptoms. It can prevent complications, like permanent facial paralysis or hearing loss. Physical therapy or rehabilitation may also be necessary for those experiencing facial weakness or difficulty with balance and coordination. Category:Diseases and disorders of the nervous system",
