 "text": "Bleed Like Me is the fourth studio album recorded and produced by alternative rock group Garbage. It was released on April 11, 2005 by Universal Music Group label Geffen in North America and by Warner Bros. Records elsewhere. The group chose a straight rock sound that was like Garbage's live performances. The first recording sessions for Bleed Like Me took place in March 2003. But Garbage quietly split up for four months starting October 2003. They reunited under producer John King in Los Angeles. There was a guest appearance by Dave Grohl on \"Bad Boyfriend\". Garbage recruited drummer Matt Walker and bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen for new recording sessions. They completed the album by the end of 2004. The band received critical praise and high chart positions for its lead single \"Why Do You Love Me\". Bleed Like Me had a strong opening week globally. It debuted in the top five in eight countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States. ==Certifications== Country Certifications Units shipped Australia Gold 35,000+ United Kingdom Silver 84,339+ (actual sales, as of 2007) United States Not Certified 284,000+ (actual sales, as of 2011) == References == Category:2005 albums Category:Garbage (band)",
