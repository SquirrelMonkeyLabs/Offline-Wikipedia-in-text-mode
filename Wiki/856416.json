 "text": "The Kashmir musk deer (Moschus cupreus) is a deer that lives in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal. Like other musk deer, the Alpine musk deer and Himalayan musk deer, the Kashmir musk deer lives in the Himalayan mountains and places around those mountains. They are large plant-eating animals that can live in cold places. ==Appearance== The Kashmir musk deer has two large teeth that stick down from its upper jaw like fangs. The male deer use them to fight other male deer. The Kashmir musk deer is .8 to 1 meter long and can weigh as much as 17 kilograms. Unlike other musk deer, the Kashmir musk deer has white fur from its chin to its chest and a black spot on its throat. There is light brown fur on the back of its neck. The fur on its back is the color of copper and may have spots. The lower parts of its legs are white, and there are black parts on its upper hind legs and rear end. Its ears are dark gray and white at the ends. It can be different colors at different times of year. ==Behavior== Kashmir musk deer all leave their feces in the same place. Scientists call this a latrine site. They do this to mark their territory, meaning to show other deer that a place belongs to them. Kashmir musk deer like to look for food where the mountains are steep and rocky. Scientists have seen them 3000-3500 meters above sea level on mountains with pine cone tree forests. ==Threats== Kashmir musk deer are in danger of dying out because human beings hunt them for their fur and their musk pods. People use musk pods to make perfumes and in traditional medicines. In the 21st century, one kilogram of musk pod can pay USD45,000. ==References== Category:Deer Category:Mammals of Asia",
