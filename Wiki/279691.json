 "text": "The Great Migration was the migration (movement) of around 6 million African Americans out of the Southern United States to the Midwest, Northeast and West. The main reasons African Americans left the South were to escape racism and seek jobs in industrial cities. There is a series of paintings about it. When a lot of African Americans moved to the south from the 1960s and onwards, it was called the New Great Migration. In 1963 to 2001, data shows the movement of African Americans back to the South following de-industrialization in Northeastern and Midwestern cities, the growth of good jobs in the South, and better racial relations. Many people moved back because of family ties and poverty.. == References == Category:20th century in the United States Category:African-American history",
