 "text": "The Arrondissements of Paris (Arrondissements de Paris) are the 20 administrative districts that divide the city of Paris, France. Each arrondissement has its own mayor, council, and local governance structure. The arrondissements are numbered from 1 to 20 and arranged in a clockwise spiral pattern from the city center, a design that contributes to Parisâ€™s unique layout. == History == The current system of 20 arrondissements was established in 1860 during a major reorganization of Paris led by Baron Haussmann, under the authority of Emperor Napoleon III. This reorganization expanded the city's boundaries, and each arrondissement was given a distinct number and administrative responsibility. Originally, Paris had only 12 arrondissements. == Government and administration == Each arrondissement functions as an administrative unit with its own **town hall** (mairie) and elected mayor. While the city of Paris is governed by a central mayor and council, each arrondissement operates with a certain level of autonomy, especially in managing local facilities and events.https://frenchly.us/paris-council-plans- combine-arrondissements/ == Population == The population and area of each arrondissement vary significantly. The central arrondissements (1st to 4th) are smaller in area but densely populated, while the outer arrondissements tend to have larger populations and more residential neighborhoods. == Related pages == * Communes of France * Subdivisions of Paris * Quartiers of Paris == References == == Other websites == * Paris City Official Site Paris Category:Paris",
