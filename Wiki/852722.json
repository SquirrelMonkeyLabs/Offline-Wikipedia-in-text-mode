 "text": "Kerry cattle ( or Buin√≠n) are a type of dairy cattle breed. They are native to Ireland. They are thought to be a very rare European breed. This breed is mainly used for dairy. The climate of southwestern Ireland was suitable for milk production all year, and the Celts also stored milk in the form of cheese and butter. Their coat is almost entirely black, with a little white on the udder. The horns are whitish with dark tips, but they usually have their horns removed. Cows weigh about and produce of milk per lactation. The milk can be well used for making cheese, butter and yoghurt. ==References== Category:Cattle breeds",
