 "text": "West Tennessee is one of the three Grand Divisions of the U.S. state of Tennessee. It is mostly the western part of the state. The area includes 21 counties between the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers. Its geography consists primarily of flat lands with rich soil and vast floodplain areas of the Mississippi River. Of the three regions, West Tennessee is the most sharply defined geographically, and is the lowest-lying. It is both the least populous and smallest by land area, of the three Grand Divisions. Its biggest city is Memphis, the state's second most populated city. ==Counties== There are 21 counties in West Tennessee. *Benton *Carroll *Chester *Crockett *Decatur *Dyer *Fayette *Gibson *Hardeman *Hardin *Haywood *Henderson *Henry *Lake *Lauderdale *Madison *McNairy *Obion *Shelby *Tipton *Weakley ==References== Category:Geography of Tennessee",
