 "text": "The New York Yankees are a professional baseball team based in the Bronx, a borough of New York City, New York. They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as part of the American League (AL) east division. The Yankees are one of two MLB teams based in New York City. The other is the National League's New York Mets. The team has won 27 World Series championships, more than any other team in the Major Leagues.List of most World Series Championships from ESPN Legendary Yankees include Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Derek Jeter. == History == From 1923 to 2008, the team's home was Yankee Stadium. Currently, they are playing at their new Yankee Stadium. In 1921, the Yankees won their first pennant (the American League championships). === Name === \"Yankee\" is slang for \"American\". As with the more common use of the term \"Yankee\", the team is more often called \"the Yanks\". Their most commonly used \"unofficial\" nickname is \"the Bronx Bombers\", or simply \"the Bombers\". This nickname was given to them by the press a long time ago. It referred to their ability to hit a lot of home runs (a home run is sometimes called a \"bomb\"). A less used nickname is \"the Pinstripers\", for their well-known uniform style. == Today == As of December 21, 2022, team's captain is Aaron Judge. Derek Jeter was the previous team captain; he retired after the 2014 season. The Yankees have a historic rivalry with the Boston Red Sox. Currently, the Yankees' team manager is Aaron Boone, and its General Manager is Brian Cashman. The team's ace pitcher is Geritt Cole. The official fight song for the Yankees is \"Here Come the Yankees\". After every home game, they play Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\". == Titles & honors == The Yankees have retired the numbers of 22 players, more than any other teams in MLB. (This is a sign of honor and means that no team member will ever use those numbers again.) Among those 22 players are baseball legends like Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Derek Jeter. Major League Baseball also retired the number 42, which Jackie Robinson wore when he broke the color barrier. The Yankees were the last team to win back- to-back World Series championships. They won three straight titles from 1998 to 2000. The Yankees won the American League pennant in 2024, and faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. == Rivalries == In 1919, the Yankees started there the biggest rivalry to date with the Boston Red Sox. The rivalry started after the former pitcher, Babe Ruth, was traded to the Yankees. == References == ==Other websites== * Official website of the New York Yankees * New York Yankees Home Uniform - American League (AL) - Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page - SportsLogos.Net ==Further Reading== Pinstripe Pride by Marty Appel",
