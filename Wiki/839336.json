She has stated in articles and interviews that to her it was a dream job in which she enjoyed the work. In late 2004, Randi's brother Mark asked her to join him at his startup Facebook, which he said was understaffed with people willing to travel and who could explain his vision. She has stated that she initially thought this was a temporary position that might last six months. Once she was in Silicon Valley and part of the innovation-driven community, she became fascinated with the possibilities and remained for ten years there on Facebook. In 2020, Zuckerberg resigned from Facebook and announced her social media firm, named \"Zuckerberg Media\". ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:American businesspeople",
