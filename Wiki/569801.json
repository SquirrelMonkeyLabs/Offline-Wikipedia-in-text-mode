The airline was allowed to resume international flights 12 years later on May 30, 2003, after the War in Iraq ended. In 2015, the European Union banned the airline from flying there. ==Gallery== File:Iraqi Airways Logo.svg|Current Iraqi Airways logo File:Iraqi Airways 727-200, 747-SP.jpg|2 Iraqi Airways planes that were grounded during the war.
