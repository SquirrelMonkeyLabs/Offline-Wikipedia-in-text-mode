 "text": "A Test Mode is a secret mode hidden in an electronic device that allows a manufacturer to test the product before it gets sent to the consumer. A consumer can access the test mode by pressing some buttons and either inserting the battery or holding down and letting go of the reset button. On entering a test mode, the electronic device will do random sounds and other things, like giving out a version number and producing a loud beep to confirm that the speaker is working. The main part of the test mode is either a rapid fire or manual sound playing program on which the electronic device cycles through it's list of sounds. Test Modes in electronic handheld games are often accessed for creativity purposes on which the consumer can record the sounds they need to make skits, commercials and other things. == References == Category:Electronics",
