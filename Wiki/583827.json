 "text": "Andrew George McCabe (born May 5, 1968) is an American attorney. He was the Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from February 1, 2016 to January 29, 2018. On May 9, 2017, McCabe became acting director after James Comey was fired from duties as Director by U.S. President Donald Trump. President Trump sent a letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, referring to a recommendation to remove Comey from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. In the absence of a Senate-confirmed Director, the deputy director automatically becomes acting director. McCabe became deputy director again after Christopher A. Wray was sworn in as the new FBI Director on August 2, 2017. On March 16, 2018, Sessions fired McCabe only 26 hours before his scheduled retirement. Sessions said he based his action on reports from the DOJ Inspector General and the FBI's disciplinary office saying that McCabe had made unauthorized releases of information to the media and had \"lacked candor\" in talking about it. McCabe denied that he had ever been dishonest and charged that his firing was politically motivated. On April 19, 2018, the Department of Justice Inspector General had earlier sent a criminal referral to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges against McCabe associated with allegations of lying to internal investigators. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:Directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Category:Lawyers from Connecticut Category:Businesspeople from Hartford, Connecticut Category:Politicians from Hartford, Connecticut",
