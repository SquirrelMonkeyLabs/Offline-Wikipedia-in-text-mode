 "text": "The Siberian Times is an English-language news website that was originally launched in Novosibirsk, Russia in 2012. According to the editor of the website, Svetlana Skarbo, their aim is to challenge people's stereotypes about the region, described as \"negative and out of date\". Will Stewart, a British journalist formulated the idea. He also often uses their content in his articles. Western media sometimes use their stories. One example is an article about frozen Siberian worms who were reanimated after thawing out of the permafrost. This story was also reported by the Smithsonian website, though the claim was also made by the academic journal Doklady Biological Sciences. Its reliability as a news source is disputed. According to Mashable, its stories are \"allegedly real with a bit of hyperbole/Siberian fan fiction thrown in\". Doubtfulnews.com also referred to the website as \"not a reliable source for news\". == References == Category:Siberia Category:Online newspapers",
