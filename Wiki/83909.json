 "text": "The Chadian orphan children scandal involved six French citizens from the aid group L'Arche de Zoé. On October 26, 2007, they attempted to fly 103 children from Chad to France, claiming they were orphans from Darfur, Sudan. However, Chadian authorities discovered that the children were actually Chadian and had living parents. As a result, the six aid workers were arrested at the airport on October 26, 2007. ==Overview== ===2007=== On December 21, 2007, the aid workers stood trial for the kidnapping of 103 children. Chad's interior minister, Ahmat Bachir, stated that the suspects could face up to 20 years of hard labor if convicted. During their detention, the six suspects engaged in a hunger strike in protest against the charges. On December 26, 2007, they were sentenced to eight years of hard labor by a Chadian court. ===2008=== In March 2008, an agreement was reached to transfer the aid workers to France to serve their sentences. Later that year, the President of Chad granted them a pardon, allowing them to be released from prison in France. ==Legacy== This incident strained diplomatic relations between France and Chad and sparked international debate on the ethics of humanitarian interventions and child adoption practices in conflict zones. It led to increased scrutiny and stricter regulations on international adoption and the operations of non- governmental organizations (NGOs) in conflict areas. ==Other websites== * Zoe's Ark workers get hard labor * French nurse falls ill during trial in Chad * French aid workers were 'saving lives,' not kidnapping: lawyer * Chad charges aid workers with kidnapping Category:2007 Category:2007 in France Category:21st century in Chad Category:International law Category:Scandals",
