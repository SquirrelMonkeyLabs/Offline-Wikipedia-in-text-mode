 "text": "The number seven is a natural number that comes after six and before eight. In Roman numerals, it is VII. == Mathematics == In mathematics, the number seven is an odd number and a prime number. It is also a Mersenne prime. ===Divisibility Rule=== * To test if an integer is divisible by 7 or not, # Take off the last digit and multiply it by 2. # Subtract that product from the root number (the integer without the last digit).Divisibility rule by 7accessed 21 October 2016 # Repeat the second step again and again until it is clear that the number is divisible by 7 or not. Example 918785 # 5×2=10, 91878-10=91868 # 8×2=16, 9186-16=9170 # 0×2=0, 917-0=917 # 7×2=14, 91-14=77 77 is divisible by 7, so the original number 918785 is also divisible by 7. Proof: Pretend a is the root number and b is the last digit. Then 10a+b is the whole number. If the whole number (10a+b) is divisible by 7, 3a+b is also a multiple of 7. And (3a+b)-7b= 3a-6b is also a multiple 7. That proves 3a-6b is divisible by seven, since 3 and 6 are both multiples of 3. So a-2b is also divisible by 7. ==In the world== *There are seven colours in the rainbow. *The atomic number of nitrogen. *The number of horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table. *The seven sacraments of the Catholic church. *Seven gates of heaven (QUR'AN 15th chapter AL-HIJR verse 44)915:44). *Seven days in a week. *Seven seas and seven continents. *Cristiano Ronaldo wears the number 7, widely known as CR7. *The number 7 is often considered as luck in Western culture. == References == Category:Integers Category:Prime numbers",
