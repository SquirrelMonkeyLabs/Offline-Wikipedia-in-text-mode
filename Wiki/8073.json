 "text": "The Nintendo DS (also known as the DS, or NDS) is a handheld game console from Nintendo. Development began in mid-2002 and it was first released in 2004. The DS is a small machine that can fold open to reveal two screens. One screen is a touchscreen, which lets people play video games made just for the Nintendo DS. The system comes with two styluses, which are used to touch the screen. The Nintendo DS was discontinued in 2013. The games are stored on small cartridges, which are like memory card chips from digital cameras. Like most Nintendo game systems, the DS loads a game quickly. The DS has many new features. It has a new surround sound system. The DS (as well as the DS Lite) also plays games made for the Game Boy Advance (only single-player mode). However, the DS cannot play Game Boy or Game Boy Color games. The Nintendo DS has a successor, the Nintendo 3DS, which has two screens like the Nintendo DS. It can also play games made for the Nintendo DS. ==Competition== The Nintendo DS was a rival of Sony's PlayStation Portable. They fought for sales in the seventh generation era. However, both Nintendo and Sony have said that their products were aimed at different people. The DS has currently sold more units than the PSP has. In 2011, the DS briefly held the record for best-selling game console. Another rival was the iPod touch made by Apple. Unlike Nintendo and Sony, Apple said that the iPod touch is better than the other systems, because it has more multimedia features along with being a game system. The Nintendo DS is used mainly to play games. ==Handheld revisions== ===Nintendo DS Lite=== Nintendo later made a newer version of the Nintendo DS, known as the Nintendo DS Lite. It was first announced on January 26, 2006 and released on March 2, 2006 in Japan, on June 1, 2006 in Australia, on June 11, 2006 in North America, on June 23, 2006 in Europe, and on January 18, 2007 in South Korea. The DS Lite can play the same games as the DS. It is smaller, lighter, and has brighter screens. Because of its design, the Game Boy Advance games stick out when they are put in Slot 2. The second slot also comes with a cover for players to put inside when they are not using the slot. The DS Lite was made in white, black, pink, blue, red, and silver colors. This console was later made in other colors, such as metallic rose, metallic silver, and black with white. ===Nintendo DSi=== On October 2, 2008, Nintendo announced a third model, the Nintendo DSi. It was released in Japan in 2008 and in 2009/2010 worldwide. It is bigger, thinner, and brighter than the DS Lite. It has an SD card slot, which is used to download games online. The Game Boy Advance slot was removed, which caused some disappointment when it came out. ===Nintendo DSi XL=== Nintendo announced another model in the DS family called the Nintendo DSi XL (called Nintendo DSi LL in Japan). Announced on October 29, 2009, it was released in Japan in 2009 and in 2010 worldwide. It is the biggest, heaviest, widest, and brightest of the Nintendo DS systems. It has the same features as the DSi. ==Games== The Nintendo DS has had many games made for it. Some games, such as Super Mario 64 DS, came out on the same day as the Nintendo DS. Some of the DS's best-selling games are Nintendogs, Super Mario 64 DS, Mario Kart DS, New Super Mario Bros., Brain Age, Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, and Advance Wars: Dual Strike. ==Accessories== There are many accessories for the Nintendo DS, including different coloured styluses and protective cases. Some protective cases include the highly durable Nerf cases. Most DS systems have a screen protector and a car adapter used to charge the DS in a car. ==Sales== In total, the DS family had sold 154.9 million units as of July 15, 2021, making it the best-selling handheld system of all time, and the best-selling Nintendo console. Overall, it is the second best-selling system behind the PlayStation 2. ==Other websites== ==References== Category:Nintendo video game consoles Category:Handheld game consoles",
