 "text": "\"Heresy\" means ideas or actions that do not agree with traditional religious doctrines. Some religious groups use the word \"heresy\" to describe beliefs that challenge theirs. A person who has these beliefs is called a heretic. == History == Jewish leaders during Jesus's lifetime called him a heretic because he did not preach traditional Judaism, according to the Gospel of Matthew (26:57-67). In its first few centuries, the Roman Catholic Church accused religious doctrines like Monophysitism and Arianism of heresy. Later, throughout the Middle Ages, they accused a number of other religious sects (like the Cathars) of being heretical. In the 11th and 12th centuries, thousands of people were burned at the stake for heresy. This execution ritual was supposedly meant to save the heretic's soul. Under torture, many people accused of heresy falsely confessed. As a result of the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church created the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It is the official doctrine that decides what heresy is and how to deal with it. Still in the 21st century, Muslims who apostatize are often treated very harshly and frequently killed. === Catholicism and Protestantism === The Catholic Church sees several heresies in Protestantism. For example: * Protestants claim only scripture (the Bible) is relevant for the faith (sola scriptura); the Catholic Church says traditions are also important. * Protestants say that belief is enough to be saved (sola fide). Catholics say that good deeds are necessary as well. * Protestants say that any baptised person can be a priest. In the Catholic and Orthodox churches, priests are ordained. This means that some people are not priests, even though they have been baptised. * According to Protestants, there is no Transubstantiation during mass (liturgy). The Roman Missal contains heresies, according to Protestants. ==References== Category:Theology",
