 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Var department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of Var are: # Arrondissement of Draguignan, (subprefecture: Draguignan), with 58 communes. # Arrondissement of Toulon, (prefecture: Toulon), with 34 communes. # Arrondissement of Brignoles, (subprefecture: Brignoles), with 61 communes. ==History== Since its creation, the Var department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the department with six districts: Toulon, Grasse, Hyères, Draguignan, Brignoles, Saint-Maximin, Fréjus, Saint-Paul-lès-Vence and Barjols; the capital was Toulon but it was moved, in 1793, from Toulon to Grasse and, in 1795, from Grasse to Brignoles. In 1797, the capital was moved again, to Draguignan. * 1800 : creation of four arrondissements: Brignoles, Draguignan, Grasse and Toulon. * 1860 : the arrondissement of Grasse passed to the new department of Alpes-Maritimes. * 1926 : the arrondissement of Brignoles was eliminated. * 1974 : Brignoles was made again an arrondissement and the capital was moved from Draguignan to Toulon. ==Related pages== *List of arrondissements of France ==References== Var",
