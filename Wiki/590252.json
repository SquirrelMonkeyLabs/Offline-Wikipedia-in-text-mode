 "text": "José Luis Cuevas (February 26, 1934 - July 3, 2017) was a Mexican artist. He was born in Mexico City. Cuevas was one of the first to challenge the then dominant Mexican muralism movement as a member of the Generación de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation). He was a mostly self-taught artist, whose styles and influences are moored to the darker side of life, often depicting distorted figures and the debasement of humanity. He had remained a controversial figure throughout his career, not only for his often shocking images, but also for his opposition to writers and artists who he feels participate in corruption or create only for money. In 1992, the José Luis Cuevas Museum was opened in the historic center of Mexico City holding most of his work and his personal art collection. Cuevas died on July 3, 2017 in Mexico City at the age of 83.Murió José Luis Cuevas, creador de prodigios ==Related pages== * List of Mexican painters ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Category:1934 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Mexican painters Category:Mexican photographers Category:Artists from Mexico City",
