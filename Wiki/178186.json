 "text": "Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (; , 603 or 605–April 680), commonly known as Mu'awiya I, was the founder and first caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate. He demanded Uthman's killers to be punished. Mu'awiya subsequently went to war with Ali for a few years. Ali was eventually martyred by the Kharijites in January 661 and Hasan was elected caliph. During Mu'awiya's reign, the Arab empire conquered much of North Africa, as well as Khurasan and Sijistan. Constantinople, the capital of the Roman Byzantine empire, was also besieged. During the last years of his caliphate, Mu'awiya declared his son Yazid to be his successor. ==Legacy== Sunni Muslims do not consider Mu'awiya a rightly- guided, though nevertheless honor him as a noble companion of Muhammad and a scribe of divine revelation. The Shia believe Mu'awiya to be a tyrant and an enemy of Ali.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muawiyah-I#:~:text=Pious%20scholars%20of%20the%20dominant,the%20Shiʿah%20because%20he%20had Ibadis also disapprove of Mu'awiya, and modern Ibadi theologians defend the early Kharijite opposition to him. Mu'awiya has nevertheless been the subject of lavish praise in Arabic literature as the ideal ruler.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muawiyah-I#:~:text=Pious%20scholars%20of%20the%20dominant,the%20Shiʿah%20because%20he%20had == References == == Bibliography == * Category:Muslims Category:602 births Category:680 deaths",
