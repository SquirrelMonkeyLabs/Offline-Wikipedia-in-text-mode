It was founded in London in 1888 by Dr. William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. It ceased to exist under that name in 1903. However, two spin-off groups were created at that time, the Stella Matutina and the Alpha et Omega. While it was popular, many well-known people joined the Golden Dawn. Some of its members included: * Algernon Blackwood * Aleister Crowley * Florence Farr * Dion Fortune * Arthur Machen * Pamela Colman Smith * Arthur Edward Waite * William Butler Yeats ==Related pages== * Hermeticism == Other websites == * Golden Dawn FAQ * The Golden Dawn Library Project * Golden Dawn Tradition, by co-founder Dr. W.
