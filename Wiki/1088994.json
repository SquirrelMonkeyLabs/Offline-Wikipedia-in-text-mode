 "text": "Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has supported them in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Before the invasion started, Belarus let the Russian Armed Forces perform weeks-long military drills on its territory. However, the Russian soldiers did not leave the country after they finished. Belarus allowed Russia to start part of the invasion in its territory, giving Russia the shortest possible land route to Ukraine's capital city, Kyiv. These forces left Ukraine within two months, which ended land-based military operations coming from Belarus and allowing Ukraine to take back their side of the border area. The situation along the border is still tense, with Ukraine closing all of the border checkpoints leading into Belarus unless there are special cases. At the start, Belarus said that they were not involved with the invasion, but they later admitted that they allowed Russian missile launchers in Belarus to shoot at Ukrainian targets. Several reports from the Belarusian opposition and Ukrainian military said that Belarusian soldiers were in Ukraine helping the Russians fight, but Belarus's leader Aleksander Lukashenko said that the reports were wrong and the Belarusian Armed Forces (BAF) would not fight in the invasion. As of early 2023, the BAF have not attacked Ukraine and stayed in Belarus for the entire war. The Belarusian leader has said that there is \"no way\" he will send soldiers into Ukraine unless they attack first. The involvement of Belarus was condemned in Western countries. According to Chatham House, Belarus's involvement in the war is not popular with the public. At the start of the invasion, Belarus held Russo-Ukrainian peace talks on its border. The talks did not make a lasting ceasefire happen. ==References== Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine",
