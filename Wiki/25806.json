 "text": "A proportionality relationship happens when two quantities or numbers x and y are related multiplicatively by a fixed number. This can occur when either their ratio x/y is a fixed number (direct proportionality), or their product xy is a fixed number (inverse proportionality). If x is directly proportional to y, then we write x \\propto y. The fixed number of a proportionality relationship is called the constant of proportionality. ==Related pages== *Relation (mathematics) * Function (mathematics) == References == Category:Mathematics",
