 "text": "Medina College, originally designed as a 6th Form College in the 1970s is a high school located on the Isle of Wight. On the 28th July 2021 the school, along with other schools on the island was cyber attacked. The culprits are now thought to be a Russian organisation. The school has failed to achieve a grade of \"Outstanding\" from Ofsted since 2008, more commonly falling within the \"Requires Improvement\" category. The current head of school is Mr. Matthew Parr-Burman, currently the Executive Headteacher of the Isle of Wight Education Federation. In the 1990s the school suffered from failing finances and Richard Williams was brought in as head of school in 2002 before stepping down in 2010. The school is part of a federation (Isle of Wight Education Federation) with two other schools on the Isle of Wight: Island Innovation IVth Form and Carisbrooke College. Until his death Anthony Minghella was the school's patron. ==Alumni== * Loretta Minghella, CEO of Christian Aid ==Other websites== Category:Colleges and universities in England",
