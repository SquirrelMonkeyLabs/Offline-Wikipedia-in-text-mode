 "text": "Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (8 November 1848 – 26 July 1925) was a German mathematician and philosopher. Today, he is remembered for the work he did in mathematical logic and the foundations of first order logic and mathematics. He is generally considered to be the father of analytic philosophy, for his writings on the philosophy of language and mathematics. When he published his works, they were mostly ignored by others of his time. Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers. ==Writings== *An overview of Frege's writings including English translations, at the university of Berkeley.
