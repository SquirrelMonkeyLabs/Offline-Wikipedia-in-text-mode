 "text": "Doctor Yellow are a group of Japanese trains which are used to test the condition of Shinkansen high-speed train lines. The trains check the tracks on the ground and also the wires which run above the trains. Their name comes from their unusual equipment onboard \"Doctor\", and the color that they are painted in \"Yellow\". The color scheme was made from reversing the color scheme (blue with a yellow stripe) used on test trains on non-high speed lines into yellow with a blue stripe. The trains can go as fast as normal shinkansen trains, up to 270 km/h on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen. ==Gallery on the doctor yellow== File:Doctor-yellow.jpg|JR West Class 922 \"Yellow Liner\" File:923 shinkansen T5 20080728.jpg|Class 923 JR West File:925 sendai untensyo.jpg|Class 925/0 JR East File:925-10 S2 Takasaki 20020925.jpg|Class 925/10 JR East File:Doctor Yellow 922-26 T3 SCMaglev and Railway Park.jpg|A Preserved Class 922 at SCMaglev Category:High-speed rail Category:Trains Category:Rail transport in Japan",
