 "text": "The root of a polynomial f is a value for x where the polynomial value f(x) is zero. For example, if the polynomial f(x) = 2x^2 + 10x - 28 then f(2) = 2\\cdot 2^2 + 10\\cdot 2 - 28=0, so 2 is a root of this polynomial. In fact, it can be seen that also -7 is a root of this polynomial. Category:Algebra",
