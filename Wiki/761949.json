Soak in the arts\", Manila, Philippines == Description == Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maiden, was the mother of Ishmael, the first son of Abraham. When Isaac, Sarah's son, made fun of his younger brother Ishmael, Sarah asked Abraham to ban him, along with his mother. Before sending them away, Abraham gave him bread and a bottle of water and sent them to the desert of Beersheba. When the water ran out, Hagar placed Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat a little far away, crying. But an angel appeared, traditionally the archangel Michael, who revealed to him a nearby water well, so that both were saved. Two scenes, the exile and the appearance of the angel are common in Italian and Dutch 17th century painting. == Bibliography == * A. Augusti e S.
