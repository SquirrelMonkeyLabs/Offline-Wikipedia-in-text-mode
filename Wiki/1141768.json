 "text": "Trouble is a board game in which players has to be the first to send four pieces all the way around the board. Pieces are moved by the number for the roll of a die using a Pop-O-Matic. The game is between two to four players, and the colours are red, blue, green and yellow. If you land a space that is occupied by any opponents piece, you capture their piece and return to their own start space. If there are no legal moves for your piece, you lose your turn and the next player goes in a clockwise direction. == References == Category:Board games",
