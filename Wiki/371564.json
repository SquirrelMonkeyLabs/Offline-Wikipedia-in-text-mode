 "text": "Marina Lambrini Diamandis (born 10 October 1985), better known by her stage name Marina (previously Marina and the Diamonds), is a Welsh singer- songwriter. She rose to fame after placing second in the BBC Sound of 2010 poll behind Ellie Goulding in the United Kingdom. Her debut album \"The Family Jewels\" was released in 2010, which contained five singles. The album reached number five upon release in the UK. Lead single \"Mowgli's Road\" was re- released in November 2009 whilst Marina was working on the album. Second single \"Hollywood\" peaked at number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. Third and fourth singles \"I Am Not A Robot\" and \"Oh No!\" became other top forty hits. Fifth and final single \"Shampain\" was released in October 2010. Marina released the single \"Radioactive\" in October 2011 as a lead single for her second album \"Electra Heart\", and it became her fourth top forty single. \"Primadonna\" was used as the lead single instead in April 2012 and achieved worldwide success. Marina released \"Electra Heart\" in the UK a week after the release of the song. It debuted at number one in the UK whilst \"Primadonna\" reached number eleven. \"Power & Control\" was released only in the UK as a second single. Marina's third studio album, 'FROOT' was released 13 March 2015 following the leak of the whole album in February of that year. Many critics named this the best album ever released in terms of lyrics, production and general aesthetic. On 16 July 2014, Marina published the bridge of the absolute tune, 'I'm Not Hungry Anymore', on Instagram, which many hoped would appear in FROOT repackage. Unfortunately not. However, in 2017 the whole song was leaked and revealed to be an absolute bop. In 2016, Marina joined Clean Bandit at Coachella, performing 'Disconnect' which would be released as a single in 2017, after some (limited) request from the fanbase. Mid-2018 Marina began teasing her upcoming album, posting a cute note on twitter and Instagram saying new album will come in Autumn. To mixed reception, she announced a collaboration called 'Someone Else's Baby' with Clean Bandit, who you may recall she performed with in 2016 and her boyfriend, Jack Patterson, is in it. She also teased some lyrics to what would soon become 'Orange Trees', released in 2019. To mark a new stage in her career, Diamandis announced via Twitter in 2018 that she would be dropping her \"and the Diamonds\" moniker to release music as simply \"Marina\", explaining that \"It took me well over a year to figure out that a lot of my identity was tied up in who I was as an artist and there wasn't much left .. In February 2019, Marina announced her fourth and most recent studio album and tour, 'Love + Fear', to be released on 26th April 2019, an album of two 8 song discs. However, to much surprise she released the 'Love' half, on 4th April 2019, at 4pm on a Thursday! (UK time). 'Fear' was released as planned on 26th April. 'Love + Fear' reached number 1 in 6 countries on release day, including Russia and Greece. It reached number 3 in the UK on the ITunes album chart. Marina is classed as a New Wave artist by critics. She is mostly known for her pop, electronic and more alternative music. == Personal life == Diamandis was born in Abergavenny, Wales. Her mother is Welsh and her father is Greek. Her parents separated when Marina was sixteen and she moved to Greece to live with her father but returned to Wales two years later. Marina first used MySpace to release music and she released two EPs before releasing her debut album. She was signed to Neon Records in 2008. Marina says her old stage name \"Marina and the Diamonds\" represents her fans and her surname rather than her backing band. == Discography == Albums *The Family Jewels (2010) *Electra Heart (2012) *FROOT (2015) *Love + Fear (2019) *Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land (2021) EPs *Mermaids Vs.
