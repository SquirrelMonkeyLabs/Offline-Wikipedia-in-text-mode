The FIDE awarded him the IM- title in 1983 and the GM-title in 1992. From that moment, he regularly played for Estonia during Chess Olympiads and European teamchampionships. Early 1998 he reached his highest rating on the FIDE rating list: 2655. He played his last tournament in 1999 in Nova Gorica reaching a shared 2nd position. Oll, who was married, fell into severe depressions after he divorced. He jumped out of the window of his house on the fifth floor and did not survive. Despite his personal problems, he still held the 42nd place on the world ranking list at that time. He was buried in Tallinn. His grave is not far from that of Paul Keres, another famous chess player. ==List of victories== *1989: Espoo, Tallinn (zonal tournament), Helsinki. *1990: Terrassa. *1991: Sydney, Helsinki. *1992: Sevilla. *1993: Vilnius, The Hague, Antwerp. *1994: New York Open (shared 1st with Jaan Ehlvest). *1995: Helsinki, Riga (zonal tournament). *1996: Saint Petersburg. *1997: Køge, Szeged (shared 1st), Hoogeveen (shared 1st).
