 "text": "The Sura (Abhira) Kingdom is mentioned as one of the kingdoms or provinces of ancient India (Bharata Varsha) as per the epic Mahabharata. The Suras were a subdivision of the Haihayas. They were mentioned along with another tribe called the Abhiras along the banks of Saraswati River where it dried up in the desert. They were dominated by the Abhiras, sometimes referred to as Surabhira The Balarama visited this place during his pilgrimage along the partially dried up river Saraswati. After this place, only a dried up river bed existed and the desert or the Maru region began. According to Mahābhārata (IX.36.) Sura lived in the region of Vinasana, in the vicinity of Abhiras (tato vinaśanam rājanājagāma halāyudhaḥ śūrābhirān prati dveṣād yatra naṣṭā sarasvatī). The Suras and Abhiras' are associated together in the Mahabharata and Harivansa and appear to have been a pastoral people in the upper portion of the North-western Punjab represented by the Ahirs and Gwalas of the present day. == References in Mahabharata == There are the Sura-abhiras, the Dardas, the Kasmiras, and the Pattis; the Kshatriyas; the Atreyas, the Bharadwajas, the Stanaposhikas, the Poshakas, the Kalingas, and diverse tribes of Kiratas; the Tomaras, the Hansamargas, and the Karamanjakas among the kingdoms of Bharata Varsha (6:9). === Expeditions of Nakula === Nakula brought under subjection the mighty Gramaniya that dwelt on the shore of the sea, and the Suras and the Abhiras that dwelt on the banks of the Saraswati, and all those tribes that lived upon fisheries, and those also that dwelt on the mountains, and the whole of the country called after the five rivers, and the mountains called Amara, and the country called Uttarayotisha and the city of Divyakutta and the tribe called Dwarapala (2:31). === Pilgrimage along Saraswati river === In India a brahman is the major god, or spirit. Bala Rama proceeded to Vinasana where the Saraswati hath become invisible in consequence of her contempt for Suras and Abhiras. And since the Sarasvati, in consequence of such contempt, is lost at that spot, the Rishis, for that reason, always name the place as Vinasana (9:37). The allegations on Suras for the drying up of the river could be latter interpretations. However the mention of the drying up of river Saraswati close to the Sura-Abhira kingdoms has great geogrhapical and geological significance. === Tribute to king Yudhisthira === The Sura kings that dwelt in the regions on the seacoast, brought with them hundred thousands of serving girls of the Karpasika country, all of beautiful features and luxuriant hair and decked in golden ornaments; and also many skins of the Ranku deer as tribute unto king Yudhishthira (2:50). === In Kurukshetra War === The Madras, the Trigartas the Amvashthas, the Westerners, the Northerners, the Malavas, the Surasenas, the Suras the Maladas, the Sauviras, the Kaitavas, the Easterners, and the Southerners placing Duryodhana and Karna at their head, forming the rear guard, gladdened warriors of their own army (7:7). The Kalingas, the Singhalas, the Easterners, the Suras, the Abhiras, the D3aserakas, the Sakas, the Yavanas, the Kamvojas, the Hangsapadas, the Surasenas, the Daradas, the Madras, and the Kalikeyas, with hundreds and thousands of elephants, steeds, cars, and foot-soldiers were stationed at the neck of the Kauravabattle-array (7:20). === Sura Kings === ==== King Usinara and Kakshivat ==== Gautama Dirghatamas of rigid vows begat on the Sura woman Ausinari (the daughter of king Usinara) Kakshivat and other celebrated sons (2:21, 12:172). These sons later became the kings of Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Pundra and Suhma. ==== King Devaka ==== King Devaka had a daughter endowed with youth and beauty and begotten upon a Sura wife. Bringing her from her father's abode, Bhishma married her to Vidura of great wisdom. And Vidura begot upon her many children like unto himself in accomplishments (1:114). ==References== Category:Former countries in Asia",
