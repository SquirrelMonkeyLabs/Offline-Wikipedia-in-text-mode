 "text": "The Harda twin train derailment was a twin train derailment on 4 August 2015. It happened in Harda district, Madhya Pradesh, India. It killed around 31 people. At least 72 people were injured. Two trains passing over a small bridge both derailed within minutes of each other. The Kamayani Express was traveling to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The other train, the Janata Express, was going in the opposite direction towards Mumbai. Officials say the two accidents may have been caused by a flash flood. They also fear that an unknown number of people may have been washed away by the flooded waters of the Machak river. == References == Category:2015 disasters in Asia Category:2015 in India Category:August 2015 events Category:Madhya Pradesh Category:Railway accidents in India Category:2010s disasters in India",
