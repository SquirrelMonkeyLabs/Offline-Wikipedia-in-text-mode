The iris of the eye is gold in color with dark brown lines in it. ==Name== Scientists named this frog liniaureum for the Latin words linum for \"thread\" or \"string\" and aureum for \"golden.\" They gave the frog this name because it has a gold-colored line on each side of its body. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day.
