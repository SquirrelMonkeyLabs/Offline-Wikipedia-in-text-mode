 "text": "Leo Strauss (September 20, 1899 â€“ October 18, 1973) was a German-American political philosopher and classicist who became an expert on political philosophy. He was born in Germany to Jewish parents and later went to the United States. He spent most of his time as a teacher of political science at the University of Chicago, where he taught students and put into print 15 books.The Leo Strauss Center website bio section He was particularly concerned with the idea of whether freedom and excellence could go together,Political Philosopher and Jewish Thinker, p. 3 but his ideas were criticised by Nicholas Xenos as wanting to go back to an era of fascism.Nicholas Xenos, \"Leo Strauss and the Rhetoric of the War on Terror,\" Logosjournal.com He was against the idea of a world state as he thought it would lead to tyranny.On Tyranny, p. 143 Recent research has criticized his ideas in Persecution and the Art of Writing. Strauss argues that writing in a secretive way is needed to protect revolutionary ideas from the general public. But the evidence shows that most people during the time when Strauss's philosophers lived were illiterate, and only a few could understand complicated philosophical works. This contradicts Strauss's hypothesis. Moreover, the complexity of language make it unnecessary to devise additional ways, as Strauss suggests, to hide messages, as language itself can have multiple interpretations. Therefore, it is important to reassess these theories based on the evidence and insights, which question Strauss's argument. ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1973 deaths Category:20th-century American philosophers Category:American political scientists Category:Continental philosophers Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:20th-century German philosophers Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem faculty Category:Jewish American academics Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Jewish American writers Category:Jewish German scientists Category:Jewish German writers Category:Jewish philosophers Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Refugees from Nazism Category:Writers from Hesse",
