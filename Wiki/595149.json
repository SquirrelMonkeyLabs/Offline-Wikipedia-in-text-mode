 "text": "Brigitte Marie-Claude Macron (; née Trogneux, , previously Auzière, ; born 13 April 1953) is a French former teacher who is the wife of Emmanuel Macron, the President of the French Republic. ==Politics== In 2015, to help support her husband in his political career, she ended her career as a teacher of literature at the elite lycée Saint-Louis de Gonzague in Paris. Macron ran for the city council of Truchtersheim in Bas-Rhin in 1989, but lost. It would be the only time she would run for office. ===First Lady=== In 2017, Brigitte Macron played an active role in her husband's presidential campaign; a top adviser was quoted as saying that \"her presence is essential for him\". After winning of the French presidency, Emmanuel Macron said that his wife \"will have the role that she always had with me, she will not be hidden\". After being elected, President Macron wanted to create an official \"first lady\" title for his wife along with giving her a personal staff, office and a giving her part of the budget for her activities. This was not popular with the French people because some thought it was a sign of nepotism, something that Macron openly spoke out against. A petition against his proposal got more than 275,000 signatures, and the French government announced that Brigitte Macron would not hold the official title of \"first lady\" and would not be given an official budget. ==Personal life== In 1993, at the age of 40, she met the then 15-year-old Emmanuel Macron in La Providence High School where she was a teacher and he was a student and a classmate of her daughter. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:First Ladies of France Category:French teachers Category:Politicians from Hauts-de- France Category:People from Amiens",
