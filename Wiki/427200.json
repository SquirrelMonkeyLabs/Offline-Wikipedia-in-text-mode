The United States was the leader of this operation. Somalia was in civil war and many people were dying from hunger in this country. The goal of this operation was creating suitable conditions and calming down the situation in Somalia for helping the Somali people who needed food in the southern part of this country. After the killing of several Pakistani peacekeepers, the United Nations Security Council ordered the allied forces by the Resolution 837, that they can do anything for sending the humanitarian aid to the Somali people in accordance to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. This operation was successful. ==References== Category:1992 in Africa Category:1993 Category:History of Somalia Category:1990s conflicts",
