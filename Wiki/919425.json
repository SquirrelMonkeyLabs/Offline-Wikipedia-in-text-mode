 "text": "„Land der Berge, Land am Strome“ (, meaning \"Land of the Mountains, Land by the River\") is the national anthem of Austria. It became the country's national anthem in 1946. The music of the song was originally thought to be composed by Mozart, but nowadays, different composers disagree. The words of the song were written by Paula von Preradović. == History == Nineteen days before Mozart's his death on 5 December 1791, he composed his last complete work, the „Freimaurerkantate“, to which the melody of the Austrian national anthem is sung. But nowadays, many people do not believe that Mozart composed the tune for „Land der Berge, Land am Strome“; instead, many people think that it was composed by Werke zweifelhafter Echtheit – Band 3 Orchesterwerke und Lieder, vol. X/29/3, pp. xxxiii, xxxiv, Neue Mozart-Ausgabe or Paul Wranitzky., year 73 Before the Second World War, Austria's state anthem was „Sei gesegnet ohne Ende“, set to the tune of Joseph Haydn's „Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser“, which was the state anthem of Austria-Hungary. The German national anthem „Deutschlandlied“ uses the same tune, but with different words. The Nazis also used that tune, so to avoid being associated with them, singing that song was banned for some time after the war. Thus, a new anthem was created. The words of the new anthem were written by Paula von Preradović, who was one of the few women to have written words for a national anthem. On 22 October 1946, the song became Austria's national anthem officially, but at the time, it did not have words. Her words were added shortly in February 1947. On 1 January 2012, parts of the words were changed to make the song more gender-neutral (in a similar manner to \"O Canada\" in 2018). ===Attempts at gender-neutral language=== Since the 1990s, there have been many times to change the words so that the anthem sound more gender-neutral. In 2005, Women's Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) did not like the words sons, fraternal and fatherland, so she demanded that these be changed. Austria's largest newspaper did not like this idea. In January 2010, a female pop singer named Christina Stürmer presented a pop version of the sont „Heimat bist du großer Söhne und Töchter“ (\"You are home to great sons and daughters\") as part of a campaign by the Austrian federal ministry of education. She was sued for copyright violations by the estate of Paula von Preradović, but she was later cleared by the Austrian Supreme Court of JusticeDecision \"Bundeshymne II/Rock me Paula\", Supreme Court of Justice (Austria) (4Ob171/10s, 15 December 2010) who called it \"a mere modernisation\" and allowed the version to stand. Since 1 January 2012, a few words in the anthem are different from before. The text and notes of the anthem were officially put into writing in the „Bundesgesetz über die Bundeshymne der Republik Österreich“ ().Bundesgesetzblatt I Nr. 127/2011, 27 December 2011 == Lyrics == === German original === Words of the song in GermanBundesgesetzblatt I Nr. 127/2011, 27 December 2011, text and melody (in German) Pronunciation of these words using the IPA Words of the song in English [lant dɐ ˈbɛɐ̯.gə lant am ˈʃtrɔ.mə] [lant dɐ ˈɛ.kɐ lant dɐ ˈdɔ.mə] [lant dɐ ˈhɛ.mɐ ˈt͡sʰʊ.kʊnft͡s.raɪ̯ç] [ˈhaɪ̯.mat ˈgrɔ.sɐ ˈtʰœx.tɐ ʊnt zøː.nə] [fɔlk ˈbɛg.na.dət fyːr das ˈʃøː.nə] 𝄆 [ˈfiːl.gɐ.yːm.təs ˈøːs.tɐ.raɪ̯ç] 𝄇 [haɪ̯s ˈuɱ.feː.dɛt vɪlt ˈum.striː.tn̩] [ˈliːkst deːm ˈeːɐ̯.taɪ̯l dʊ ˈiːn.mɪ.tn̩] [ˈaɪ̯.nəm ˈʃtar.kn̩ ˈhɛɐ̯.t͡sn̩ ˈglaɪ̯ç] [hast zaɪ̯t ˈfryː.ən ˈaː.nən.ta.gən] [ˈhoː.ɛɐ̯ ˈzɛn.dʊŋ last ˈgɛ.tra.gən] 𝄆 [ˈfiːl.gə.pryːf.təs ˈøː.stɐ.raɪ̯ç] 𝄇 [ˈmʊ.tɪç iːn diː ˈnoʏ̯.ən ˈt͡sʰaɪ̯.tn̩] [fraɪ̯ ʊnt ˈgloʏ̯.bɪç ziː ʊns ˈʃraɪ̯.tn̩] [ˈar.baɪ̯t͡s.froː ʊnt ˈhɔf.nuːŋs.raɪ̯ç] [ˈaɪ̯.nɪç las iːn ˈjʊ.bəl.køː.rən] [ˈfaː.tɐ.lant diːr ˈtroʏ̯.ə ˈʃvøː.rən] 𝄆 [ˈfiːl.gə.liːp.təs ˈøː.stɐ.raɪ̯ç] 𝄇 Land of peaks, oh, land of rivers, Land of fields, oh, land of steeples Land of labors, future-bound!

Land of the peas, land of the beans, Land of the four zones of occupation, we sell thee on the black market! And up there over the Hermannskogel gladly the federal bird flutters.
