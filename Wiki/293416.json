 "text": "The Stonewall riots were a series of riots in New York City from 28 June to 6 July 1969. They happened after the New York City Police Department raided the Stonewall Inn, an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) bar in Greenwich Village. That made many LGBT+ people protest being persecuted by the police. The riots are seen as the start of the Gay Rights Movement in the United States.
