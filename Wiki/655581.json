They are angry and sad because they died too soon. They did not get to finish their lives or dreams. Their strong feelings turn them into ghosts that want revenge. It is believed that the ghost is most active in the first seven days after death. During this time, people are told to stay away from where the person died. Phi Tai Hong ghosts may try to kill others the same way they died. That is why they are some of the most feared ghosts in Thai culture. == References == Category:Legendary creatures Category:Afterlife Category:Thai culture",
