Scientists saw this frog inside Monumento Natural Cerro Guanay, a protected place. ==Young== The male frogs sit near streams and call to the female frogs. Scientists think that the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is not in danger of dying out but also not in no danger at all. Climate change could hurt this frog by killing the plants in its home. Diseases from viruses, bacteria, and fungi could also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
