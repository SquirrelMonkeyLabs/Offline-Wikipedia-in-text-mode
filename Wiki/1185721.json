 "text": "The Cameroon Wolterstorff toad or montane forest tree toad (Wolterstorffina parvipalmata) is a toad. It lives in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Equatorial Guinea. ==Home== This toad lives near streams and waterfalls high in the hills and mountains. Scientists saw it between 800 and 2000 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this toad in some protected places. They saw it in Cross River National Park and they saw it near Reserve Scientifique de la Caldera. ==Young== Scientists think the frog has young in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this toad is in big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the toad lives. Chemicals from farms can kill the toad too. Human beings also killed too many trees in some places, especially to get the bark from the Prunus africanus tree, which pharmaceutical companies use to make medicine. Scientists think the disease chytridiomycosis could have killed many of these toads, even though they have not found the fungus that causes it on the toads. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
