 "text": "Stanley Peak is a 3,155 m high mountain (10,335 ft) located in the Ball Range, at the northeastern section of Kootenay National Park, in Canadian Rocky Mountains (British Columbia / Canada). The mountain was named in 1901 by its first climber, the English explorer Edward Whymper, after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, the sixth Governor-General of Canada. There are sources that date the namimg in 1912 after Stanley H. Mitchell, Secretary-Treasurer of Alpine Club of Canada. The peak is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 93. Stanley Glacier on the northeast face of the peak can be seen up close by following a hiking trail into a hanging valley between the peak and a southern outlier of Storm Mountain. Stanley Peak can be ascended from a scrambling route by late summer but involves much route-finding among the many ledges and gullies on the north face. Climbing routes (UIAA III) travel the north and northeast faces. == Other BC peaks == There are another two peaks in British Columbia called Stanley Peak. One is 2,935 m high, located at the Squamish-Lillooet regional district (), 24 km north-west from Keyhole Falls and 62 km west from Gold Bridge,. The other is 2,030 m high, in the Stikine region () (90 km north-west from Skagway, Alaska). ==References== Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Geography of British Columbia Category:Mountains of British Columbia",
