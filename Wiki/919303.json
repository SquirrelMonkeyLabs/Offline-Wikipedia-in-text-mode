Her publisher, Beth, insists that she must embark on a book tour with Alan as an effort to get Loretta to go out more. After a disastrous start, mostly due to the popularity of Dash, Loretta is met by eccentric billionaire Abigail Fairfax. Fairfax realizes that Loretta has based her books on actual historic research she did with her deceased archaeologist husband. Fairfax has discovered a lost city on a remote Atlantic island and is convinced that this is the location of 'The Crown of Fire,' a priceless treasure. When Loretta does not help decipher an ancient map to the treasure, Fairfax, who fears the site will be destroyed by an active volcano, kidnaps Loretta and takes her to the island. Alan, who is secretly in love with Loretta, witnesses her kidnapping. He gets Jack Trainer, an ex-Navy SEAL turned CIA operative, to meet him at the island for a rescue attempt. Jack, with no assistance from Alan, breaches Fairfax's compound and frees Loretta, but is shot in the head before he, Loretta and Alan can make it to the airport, forcing the two to escape into the jungle. Loretta and Alan spend a day fighting off Fairfax's men before reaching a nearby village. when she hears a folk song from a local, Loretta decides that the crown is hidden in a sinkhole in the jungle. The pair are kidnapped again and forced to tell Fairfax. When they get there they discover the tomb of a queen, whose 'Crown of Fire' was made of red seashells gathered by her husband who is buried with her. The actual treasure of the legend wasn't a priceless jewel but the inseparable love between the king and queen. Fairfax is angry and forces them into the tomb as the volcano erupts, but one of his men has a change of heart and leaves a crowbar to help them escape before abandoning Fairfax on the island. Beth arrives with the local Coast Guard and Fairfax, who pretended to be stranded to get rescued, is arrested for his crimes.
