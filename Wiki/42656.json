Her father's work affected her use of colour and texture in her paintings. \"I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey, what my father did in his tweed\", she said. She went to France during 1920 – 1933. ==Images== * Altar in Pigna * National Galleries of Scotland * Still Life with Two Figures * Tate Gallery Category:1895 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Scottish painters",
