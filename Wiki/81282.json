The purpose of the head tie worn by enslaved African women was to protect their hair as they labored (or did heavy work). The head tie worn by West African women has been worn since the 1960s. The name of the head tie varies according to region and historical context. These names have included: tignon (United States), dhuku (Zimbabwe), tukwi (Botswana) and doek (South Africa and Namibia). ==Related pages== *Head scarf *Hijab == References == Category:Headgear",
