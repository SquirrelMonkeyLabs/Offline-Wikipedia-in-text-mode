 "text": "The West Somerset Railway (WSR) is a heritage railway. It runs along the edge of the Quantock Hills in Somerset, England, between Bishops Lydeard and Watchet. However, occasionally services run the full length of the line to Norton Fitzwarren where the railway joins the mainline. The line then turns inland to Washford. It then returns to the coast for the run to Minehead. The Exmoor National Park is nearby. Category:Heritage railways in England",
