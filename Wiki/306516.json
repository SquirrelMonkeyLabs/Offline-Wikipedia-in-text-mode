 "text": "In chemistry, yield (also called chemical yield or reaction yield) is the amount of product resulting from a chemical reaction.Vogel, A.I., Tatchell, A.R., Furnis, B.S., Hannaford, A.J. and P.W.G. Smith. Vogel's Textbook of Practical OrganicHall, 19936-3. The absolute yield gives the weight in grams, and the molar yield gives the number of moles. The fractional yield, relative yield, or percentage yield shows how completely a synthetic procedure worked. It is calculated by dividing the amount of product by the theoretical yield (the unit of measurement for both must be the same): \\mbox{fractional yield} = \\frac{\\mbox{actual yield}}{\\mbox{theoretical yield}} To get the percentage yield, one must multiply the fractional yield by 100% (e.g., 0.673 Ã— 100% = 67.3%). The ideal percentage yield of a chemical reaction is 100%, but it cannot be achieved because measurements are never completely accurate. Yields around 100% are \"quantitative\", yields above 90% are \"excellent\", yields above 80% are \"very good\", yields above 70% are \"good\", yields above 50% are \"fair\", and yields below 40% are \"poor\". ==References== Category:Chemistry",
