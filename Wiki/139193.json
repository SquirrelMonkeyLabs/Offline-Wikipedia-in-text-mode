 "text": "Louis \"Studs\" Terkel (May 16, 1912 – October 31, 2008) was an American author, historian, actor, and broadcaster who lived in Chicago. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his work The Good War. This book collected stories from average people about their memory of World War Two. The nickname \"Studs\" came from his character in a play, after the director would call him that to avoid confusion with another actor called Louis. ==Selected works== * Giants of Jazz (1957) ISBN 1-56584-769-5 * Division Street: America (1967) ISBN 0-394-42267-8 * Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression (1970) * Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do (1974) * Talking to Myself: A Memoir of My Times (1977) * American Dreams: Lost and Found (1983) ISBN * The Good War (1984) * Chicago (1986) * The Great Divide: Second Thoughts on the American Dream (1988) * Race: What Blacks and Whites Think and Feel About the American Obsession (1992) * Coming of Age: The Story of Our Century by Those Who’ve Lived It (1995) * My American Century (1997) * The Spectator: Talk About Movies and Plays With Those Who Make Them (1999) * Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Reflections on Death, Rebirth and Hunger for a Faith (2001) * Hope Dies Last: Keeping the Faith in Difficult Times (2003) * And They All Sang: Adventures of an Eclectic Disc Jockey (2005) ISBN |1-59558-003-4 * Touch and Go (2007) * P.S.
