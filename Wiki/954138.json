 "text": "The Brazilian heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes kautskyi) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen this as high as 600 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large area and because there are so many of them. They think there are fewer of this frog than before because humans change the places where the frog lives, but not enough for the frog to be in danger. Unlike some other frogs, this frog cannot live in place that humans have changed too much. It can only live in real forests and not in tree farms where humans grow trees to harvest. People have seen this frog on bromeliad plants. The frog lays its eggs in the plant and the tadpoles swim in pools of water in the leaves. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
