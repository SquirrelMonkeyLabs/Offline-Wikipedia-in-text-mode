His son was named Amren. He also had a daughter named Eneuavc. Bedivere was one of the first knights to join the Round Table. He was also one of Arthur's earliest followers. He and Arthur fought the Giant of Mont Saint-Michel. He lost one hand in a battle. Only he and Arthur survived the \"Battle of Camlan\". But Arthur received a wound in the battle and was dying. Arthur commanded Bedivere to throw his magical sword Excalibur back into the Lake. Twice Bedivere lied to Arthur but the third time he threw the sword into the lake it came from.
