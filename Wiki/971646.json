In 1982 Mussolini and her mother visited Japan. Mussolini had not sung before, but when asked, her mother said she can sing for an advertisement. Mussolini said \"When I sang in Japan, Cristiano Malgioglio (author of some songs on the album) saved me\". The album was first shown in Italy on Canale 5 in 1996. In 2000, a copy of the album was sold in London for 10 million lira.
