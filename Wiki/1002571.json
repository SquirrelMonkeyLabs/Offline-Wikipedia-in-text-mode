Instead of lavender, Purple made it in as a web color. These are commonly used to compliment the above colors. 3rd row: Even darker versions usually used on their own. 4th row: These colors are rarely used and thus there is no consensus (agreement) as to what these colors should be named (except for Chocolate and Teal). 5th row: At 0 value, all hues will show black.
