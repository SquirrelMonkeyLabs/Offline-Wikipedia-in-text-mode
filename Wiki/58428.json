 "text": "\"Sumer Is Icumen In\" is a very old English song that can be sung as a round. It is the oldest known example of a round. Its composer is unknown. It was written down around the mid-13th century by a monk in Reading Abbey, but we do not know whether that monk composed it or whether it was older. The title means \"Summer has arrived\". The round can be sung in six parts. There are also two parts that can be repeated again and again (an ostinato) throughout the piece. The language is Middle English and is based on the dialect spoken in Wessex, England. at the time. ==Music== This is the manuscript that the monk wrote: To sing as a round, one singer (or group of singers) would begin at the beginning, a second singer would start at the beginning as the first got to the point marked with the red cross, the third would join in when the second singer got to the red cross, and so on until all six were singing. The repeated pattern is marked \"Pes\". The instructions are written in Latin. Here is the song in modern notation: ==English lyrics (secular)== Here are the words with a Modern English translation: Middle (Medieval) English words Modern English Sumer is icumen in, Lhude sing cuccu! Groweþ sed and bloweþ med And springþ þe wde nu, Sing cuccu! Awe bleteþ after lomb, Lhouþ after calue cu. Bulluc sterteþ, bucke uerteþ, Murie sing cuccu! Cuccu, cuccu, wel singes þu, cuccu; Ne swik þu nauer nu. Summer has arrived, Loudly sing, Cuckoo! Seeds grow and meadows bloom And the forest springs anew, Sing, Cuckoo! The ewe bleats after the lamb, The cow lows after the calf. The bullock jumps, the stag cavorts, Merrily sing, Cuckoo! Cuckoo, cuckoo, well you sing, cuckoo; Nor will you ever stop now.
