 "text": "Observational Astronomy is a type of astronomy. One has to record, analyse, and study data taken from giant telescopes located in observatories in isolated places. People will use giant telescopes to take a look on an object in the night sky and then study that object. Many times, one will have to study a photo of an object they themselves did not take. == Reference == https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_astronomy == Other websites == https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/",
