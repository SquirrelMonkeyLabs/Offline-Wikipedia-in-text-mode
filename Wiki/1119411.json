 "text": "A Series Bible is a book that Television show creators write to explain the idea of a show. Other writers also have to look in the Series Bible to write new episodes of the show because it explains everything. In the United States, writing a Series Bible can make a person eligible to join the Writers Guild of America. In Great Britain, a Series Bible is 15 to 30 pages long and has to explain (at least) the first season of the show. Category:Television series",
