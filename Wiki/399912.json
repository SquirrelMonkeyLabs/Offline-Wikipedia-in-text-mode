 "text": "The fourth generation of video game consoles began on October 30, 1987. The fourth generation (also called the 16-bit generation) began with the release of Nippon Electric Company's (NEC) PC Engine. Although NEC released the first fourth-generation console, this generation was dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo became the largest worldwide market share in the fourth generation. Sega was also successful in this generation. It began a new franchise, Sonic the Hedgehog. This was done so Sega could compete with Nintendo's Mario series of games. Many other companies released consoles in this generation. However, none of them were successful, except for Neo Geo from SNK. The first handheld game console released in the fourth generation was the Game Boy, on April 21, 1989. The Game Boy became the most popular handheld game console. The Game Boy's screen had no color. However, many of its leading competitors did. Three major franchises were introduced for the Game Boy. These include: Tetris, Pokemon and Kirby. Many of the popular games in this generation originally started in the 8-bit generations. These titles include Mario, Metroid, Zelda, Star Fox, Kirby, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Seiken Densetsu (Secret of Mana), Sonic the Hedgehog, Donkey Kong, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Mega Man X. The next generation would be the one that changed everything. == Home video game consoles == === Comparison === Name PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 Mega Drive/Genesis Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System Neo Geo AES Manufacturer NEC/Hudson Soft Sega Nintendo SNK Console Launch prices (USD) US$199.99 US$189.99 US$199.99 US$649.99 (Gold version) US$399.99 (Silver version) Release date Media HuCard (card-shaped cartridge) CD-ROM (Turbo CD add-on) Cartridge CD-ROM (Mega-CD add-on) Data card (Power Base Converter add-on) Cartridge Magnetic disc (Japan only) Cartridge Data card (Europe/Japan) Best-selling games Bonk's Adventure Sonic the Hedgehog (15 million) Super Mario World, 20 million (as of June 25, 2007) Samurai Shodown Backward compatibility Sega Master System (using Power Base Converter) Game Boy (using Super Game Boy) Accessories (retail) * TurboGrafx- CD * TurboTap * TurboStick * Super System Card * TurboBooster * TurboBooster Plus * Sega Mega-CD * Sega 32X * Mouse * Menacer * Power Base Converter * Sega Activator * Multitap * Super Scope * Multitap * Super Game Boy * SNES Mouse * Super Advantage * Neo Geo Controller Pro * Neo Geo Memory Card CPU HuC6280A (modified 65SC02) 1.79 or 7.16 MHz Motorola 68000 7.67 MHz (7.61 MHz PAL) Zilog Z80 3.58 MHz Nintendo-custom 5A22 (based on 65C816) 3.58 MHz (3.55 MHz PAL) Motorola 68000 12 MHz Zilog Z80 4 MHz Memory 8 KiB work RAM 64 KiB video RAM 64 KiB main RAM 64 KiB video RAM 8 KiB audio RAM 128 KiB main RAM 64 KiB video RAM 64 KiB audio RAM 64 KiB main RAM 74 KiB video RAM 2 KiB audio RAM ===Other=== File:CDTV.jpg|Commodore CDTV Released in 1991 File:Philips-CDi-400-Console-Set.png|Philips CD-i 1991-1998 File:A'can 01.jpg|Super A'Can Released in 1995 === Worldwide sales === Console Units sold Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System 49.10 million Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis 40 million PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 10 million CD-i 570,000 == List of handheld consoles == Console Game Boy Atari Lynx Sega Game Gear TurboExpress Manufacturer Nintendo Atari Sega NEC Image Launch price ¥12,500 US$89.95 US$189.99 ¥14,500 US$149.99 A$155 US$299.99 Release date April 21, 1989 August 1989 1990 September 1989 1990 October 6, 1990 April 26, 1991 April 26, 1991 1992 November 16, 1990 1991 Units sold 118.69 million (as of December 31, 2009), including Game Boy Color units 5 million (as of July 30, 2007) 15 million (as of July 30, 2007) 1.5 million Media Cartridge Cartridge Cartridge Datacard Best-selling games Tetris, 35 million (pack-in / separately).
