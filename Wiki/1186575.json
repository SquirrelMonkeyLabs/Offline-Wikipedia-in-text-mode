 "text": "Salaf (Arabic: السلف, \"predecessors\") refers to the earliest generations of Muslims, particularly the first three generations praised by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. The term is commonly used in Islamic scholarship to denote the righteous forebears of the Muslim ummah whose understanding of the religion serves as a model for later generations. == Definition == Linguistically, Salaf means \"those who came before.\" In Islamic terminology, it typically refers to: # The Ṣaḥābah (Companions of the Prophet ﷺ) # The Tābiʿūn (Followers of the Companions) # The Atbāʿ al-Tābiʿīn (Followers of the Followers) These three generations are collectively known as the Salaf al- Ṣāliḥ (the pious predecessors). == Prophetic Praise == The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: > \"The best of people are my generation (The Ṣaḥābah), then those who come > after them (The Tābiʿūn), then those who come after them (The Atbāʿ al- > Tābiʿīn).\" — Sahih al-Bukhari (2652), Sahih Muslim (2533) This hadith is the basis for the high status given to the Salaf in Sunni Islam. == Importance in Islamic Thought == The methodology of the Salaf is characterized by: * Strict adherence to the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah * Understanding texts based on the interpretation of the early generations * Rejection of religious innovations (bidʿah) This approach is known as Manhaj al-Salaf and is foundational in the theological and jurisprudential positions of many Sunni scholars. == Notable Salaf Islamic Scholars == * Abu Bakr al- Ṣiddīq (d. 634 CE) * ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (d. 644 CE) * ʿAbdullah ibn Masʿūd (d. 653 CE) * Imam Mālik ibn Anas (d. 795 CE) * Imam al-Shāfiʿī (d. 820 CE) * Imam Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal (d. 855 CE)",
