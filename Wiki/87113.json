It hears appeals from the Oberverwaltungsgerichte, or Superior Administrative Courts, which, in turn, are the courts of appeals for decisions of the Verwaltungsgerichte (Administrative Courts). Although cases about social security law and tax law are arguments between a person and the government, there are special courts for these matters. The Bundessozialgericht is federal court of appeals for social security law, cases about tax and customs law are decided by the Finanzgerichte (Finance Courts), and lastly by the Bundesfinanzhof. The Bundesverwaltungsgericht has its headquarters at the former Reichsgericht (Reich Court of Justice) building in Leipzig. == References == ==Other websites== * Official homepage Category:Leipzig Category:1953 establishments in Germany",
