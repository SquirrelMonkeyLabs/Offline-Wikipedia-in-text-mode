 "text": "The farthing was a coin of the Kingdom of England. It was worth one quarter of a penny, or of a pound sterling. The word 'farthing' is derived from the Anglo-Saxon feorthing. It means a fourthling or fourth part.Spink Numismatic Circular, March 1983, Volume XCI, No. 2, p.39 The Anglo-Saxon word was probably derived from the Old Norse, fjorthungr meaning a \"quarter\". Such coins were first minted in England in silver in the 13th century. They were used until 1707, when the Kingdom of England was taken over by Scottish King, King James that united The British mainland United Kingdom of Great Britain. Early farthings were silver. The farthing was small (only 10 millimeters in diameter) and very light (slightly more than 0.4 gram). Surviving examples are rare. The first copper farthings were issued during the reign of King James I. In the late 17th century the English farthing was also minted in tin. In 1953, the British farthing's low value forced its last minting. A Londoner complained of abusive vendors when he tried to offer the coin for purchases. The coin ceased to be legal tender on 1 January 1961. ==References== Category:Former currencies of the United Kingdom",
