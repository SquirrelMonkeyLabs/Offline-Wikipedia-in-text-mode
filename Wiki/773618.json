 "text": "Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. (born November 8, 1945) is an American serial killer, serial rapist, burglar, and former police officer. He murdered about thirteen people, raped 50 women, and did over 100 burglaries in California between 1974 and 1986.; ==Crime spree== He was responsible for at least three crime sprees throughout California. DeAngelo killed many people in southern California, where he was known as the Night Stalker and later the Original Night Stalker (because serial killer Richard Ramirez had also been called the \"Night Stalker\"). He is believed to have threatened both victims and police. During the decades-long investigation, several suspects were cleared through DNA evidence, alibi, or other investigative methods. In 2001, after DNA testing indicated that the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker were the same person, the name EARONS started to be used. He was nicknamed Golden State Killer in early 2013 to raise awareness that he was not caught. ==Capture== The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local law- enforcement agencies held a news conference on June 15, 2016, to announce a renewed nationwide effort. On April 24, 2018, authorities charged 72-year-old DeAngelo with eight counts of first-degree murder, based upon DNA evidence;; investigators had identified members of DeAngelo's family through forensic genetic genealogy. ==Verdict== DeAngelo cannot be charged with 1970s rapes, but he was charged in August 2018 with 13 related kidnapping and kidnapping attempts.; On June 29, 2020, DeAngelo pled guilty to multiple counts of murder and kidnapping. As part of the plea bargain, DeAngelo was also required to admit to many crimes he had not been formally charged with, including rapes. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American people convicted of assault Category:American people convicted of manslaughter Category:American serial killers Category:American rapists Category:Criminals from New York (state) Category:Criminals from California Category:People from San Francisco Category:People from Sacramento, California",
