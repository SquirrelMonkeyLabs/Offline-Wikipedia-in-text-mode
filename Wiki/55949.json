 "text": "A turbine is an engine that turns fluid movement into energy. This energy can be changed to make electricity with a generator. A turbine is a turbomachine with normally 1 moving part called a rotor assembly (a shaft or drum with blades attached) Moving fluid, normally water, moves the blades so that they transfer energy to the rotor. Some early turbine examples include windmills and waterwheels. A casing can be placed around the turbine to control the movement of the fluid. Credit for the invention of the steam turbine is given both to Anglo-Irish engineer Sir Charles Parsons (1854 - 1931) for invention of the reaction turbine(turbines that utilize water pressure and water speed to rotate), and to the Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval (1845-1913) for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines normally utilize both the reaction and impulse turbine in one system. ==Types== * Steam turbine * Gas turbine * Transonic turbine * Jet engine, including * Turbojet * Turbofan * Turboprop * Turboshaft * Ceramic turbine * Contra-rotating turbine * Statorless turbine * Shrouded turbine * Shroudless turbine * Bladeless turbine * Water turbine * Wind turbine * Impulse turbine * Velocity compound Curtis == References == == Other websites == * Turbine introductory math * Turbines jet powered 1/16 scale Airbus A330 Category:Engineering",
