They carry their wings low and stand straighter than most chickens. An adult male chicken weighs six pounds and an adult female weighs four pounds. ==History== The Sultan chicken came to Europe from Turkey, where it is called serai taook. People put them in the Sultan's gardens because they were so beautiful and because they did not damage the grass as much as other chickens did. In 1854, Elizabeth Hempstead of London wrote an article about Sultan Chickens in the Poultry Chronicle. A friend in Constantinople had sent her a few Sultan chickens. The first Sultan chickens came to the North America in the 1860s. ==References== Category:Domesticated animals",
