 "text": "Shreve's rocket frog (Anomaloglossus shrevei) is a frog. It lives in Amazonas, Venezuela. ==Home== These frogs live near streams in tropical forests. Scientists saw the frog on Mount Marahuaca and on Cerro Duida between 350 and 1200 meters above sea level. All of the places where scientists saw the frog are inside Duida-Marahuaca National Park. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some big danger of dying out. Diseases could hurt this frog. Climate change could hurt this frog, but scientists think it might not hurt this frog as much as other frogs. A. shrevei can live high on mountains, on the middles of mountains, or low to the ground, so it can move up or down if the weather becomes hotter or colder. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
