 "text": "A prophage is a bacteriophage genome. It is part of the circular bacterial DNA chromosome, or it is a plasmid outside the circular chromosome.. This is a latent form of a phage: the viral genes are there in the bacterium but cause no disruption of the bacterial cell. Pro means \"before\", so, prophage means the stage of a virus inserted into host DNA before being activated inside the host. Prophages are important agents of horizontal gene transfer. == References == Category:Virology Category:Horizontal gene transfer",
