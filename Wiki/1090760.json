It lives in the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. People have seen it between 200 and 2000 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog on small, woody plants. Scientists are not sure whether this frog needs forests to live. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, loss of the forests where it lives for farms may hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
