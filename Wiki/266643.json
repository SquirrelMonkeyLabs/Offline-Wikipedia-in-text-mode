He was known as the leader of a stable with Luke Harper and Erick Rowan called The Wyatt Family. Wyatt was a three-time world champion. He first wrestled in WWE from 2009 to 2011 where he competed under the name Husky Harris and was a part of the stable, The Nexus. He competed on the 2nd season of WWE NXT but was eliminated 5th. Rotunda stayed in WWE's developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), and made his debut as Bray Wyatt in FCW in April 2012. He stayed in FCW through its name change to NXT Wrestling (now WWE NXT), and returned to the main WWE roster in July 2013. The Wyatt Family quickly became some of the company's biggest heels (\"bad guys\"). In 2019, Wyatt started wresting as The Fiend. On August 24, 2023, Rotunda died from a heart attack. He had been out with a private illness since Feburary which was later said to be COVID-19. ==Championships== * WWE **WWE Championship (1 time) ** WWE Universal Championship (2 times) ** WWE Raw Tag Team Championship (1 time) (with Matt Hardy) ** WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship (1 time) (with Randy Orton and Luke Harper) (Titles were defended under the Freebird Rule) **Tag Team Eliminator (2018) (with Matt Hardy) **WWE Year-End Award for Male Wrestler of the Year (2019) *Florida Championship Wrestling **FCW Florida Tag Team Championship (one time) (with Bo Rotunda) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Feud of the Year (2010) – The Nexus vs. WWE **Most Hated Wrestler of the Year (2010) – as part of The Nexus **He was ranked #129 of the top 500 singles wrestlers by PWI in the PWI 500 in 2011. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1987 births Category:2023 deaths Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Former WWE wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from Florida",
