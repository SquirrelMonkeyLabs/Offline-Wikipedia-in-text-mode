 "text": "Hrithik Roshan (born 10 January 1974) is an Indian Bollywood actor. Roshan had appeared as a child actor in many movies in the 1980s and also appeared as an assistant director in the 1990s. He made his movie debut in his father's film, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai in 2000 with Ameesha Patel who also made her debut. His performance in the movie was widely appreciated and earned him a Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Male Debut. He followed it with leading roles in Fiza and Mission Kashmir and had a male supporting role in the blockbuster movie Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), which was India's highest-grossing movie in the overseas market at that time. This was followed by several flops in his career. The flops included Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage which reunited him with Ameesha Patel after their debut film. However, his career later improved when he acted in Koi... Mil Gaya, another film directed by his father and won two Filmfare Awards and he also acted in its sequels Krrish and Krrish 3, which were both successful. He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in the 2006 adventure film Dhoom 2, Mughal emperor Akbar in the 2008 historical romance Jodhaa Akbar and a quadriplegic in the 2010 drama Guzaarish. He played the lead in the 2011 drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 action revenge film Agneepath, the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, the 2019 biopic Super 30, and the 2019 action thriller War which ranks as his highest-grossing release. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Indian movie actors Category:Actors from Mumbai Category:Indian child actors",
