Ibn Qayyim al- Jawziyya adds swordsmanship as a fourth discipline in his treatise Al- Furūsiyya (1350). Ibn Akhi Hizam also cited that there are three fundamentals to the furusiyya: horse mastery, proficiency in handling all types of weapons, and bravery. ==References== Category:Knights Category:Islamic culture",
