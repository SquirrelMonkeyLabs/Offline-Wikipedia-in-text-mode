 "text": "A nanosecond (ns) is one billionth of a second. It is equal to 10âˆ’9 seconds. One nanosecond contains 1000 picoseconds. 1000 nanoseconds is equal to one microsecond. Ten nanoseconds are sometimes called a shake. Some things that take between one nanosecond and ten nanoseconds are listed below * Light travels about 29.9 centimeters in 1 nanosecond. That is 3.33564095 nanoseconds to move 1 meter. * It takes a fusion reaction between 20 and 40 nanoseconds to finish in a hydrogen bomb. * It takes a nuclear reaction 10 nanoseconds to finish one generation with fast neutrons. * The half-life of a K meson is 12 nanoseconds.
