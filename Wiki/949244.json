 "text": "When talking about food, a turnover is a piece of dough which is folded so that it can contain a filling. The turnover is usually baked in the oven, but sometimes it is fried. It can be sweet or salty. Turnovers are often sold as a form of convenience food. A well-known type of turnover is the calzone, which was first seen in Naples in the 19th century.
