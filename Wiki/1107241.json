People see this frog in many different kinds of places: valleys with forests, ponds, and places where the water comes out of the ground very hot, streams, and rice fields. The female frog lays eggs on rocks or in caves near water. Tadpoles can swim in puddles or streams, but they can also live in hot water. They see this frog between 0 and 1800 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out. Sometimes people sell this frog as a pet. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
