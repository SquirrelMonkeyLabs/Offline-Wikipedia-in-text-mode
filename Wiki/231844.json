 "text": "The Bloods are a street gang. They were founded in 1972 in Los Angeles, California. They are rivals with the Crips, another street gang centred mainly around Los Angeles. Bloods members are known for wearing mostly red colors which is their gang color. During their rivalry with the Crips in the 1970s, a faction of the Crips called the Pirus street gang broke away from the Crips and joined other smaller gangs to make a gang which would later on become known as the Bloods. Some notable Bloods are rappers Game and Suge Knight. ==References== == Other websites == *Bloods gang profile Category:1972 establishments in California Category:Gangs Category:People from Los Angeles",
