 "text": "The 2019 Brazil wildfires is the result of at least 75,336 wildfires occurred in the country since January 2019. As of August 20, there are fires burning in the Amazon rainforest in four Brazilian states: Amazonas, Rondônia, Mato Grosso and Pará. At least 39,194 fires have been detected in Amazonas, which is the largest state in Brazil by area, and which has the \"largest standing tracts of unbroken rainforest\" in the world. A state of emergency was declared by the government of Amazonas on August 11. The federal government and President Jair Bolsonaro claims that the data on the numbers are \"fake\" and refuses to help end the fires or allow other countries to help. In August, Bolsonaro said no one was allowed to set fires in the Amazon for 60 days. When someone wants to change rainforest land into a farm or other thing, first they cut down the trees and leave them there. Then they allow the land to dry. Then they set it on fire. So many of the trees were still killed because people could cut them down and wait to burn them until later. Wildfires were also a problem on the Cerrado grassland, a place with many rare plants and animals. 40% of its animals do not live in any other place on Earth. ==Related pages== *2020 Brazil wildfires ==References== Category:2019 fires 2019 wildfires Category:January 2019 events Category:February 2019 events Category:March 2019 events Category:April 2019 events Category:May 2019 events Category:June 2019 events Category:July 2019 events Category:August 2019 events Category:September 2019 events Category:October 2019 events Category:November 2019 events Category:December 2019 events Category:Wildfires",
