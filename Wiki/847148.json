 "text": "A flapjack (also known as a cereal bar, oat bar or oat slice) is a baked dessert bar. It is cooked in a flat oven tin and cut into squares or rectangles. It is made from rolled oats, fat (typically butter), brown sugar and usually golden syrup. They are available commercially, sold in packs. \"Diet\" versions are available with less fat and calories. In 2022 there was a court case about whether some commercial ones were confectionery. Confectionery in the United Kingdom is charged 20% value-added tax. Traditional flapjacks are counted as cakes, and so not taxed. The snack is like the North American granola bar. In America flapjack is the name for what in the UK is called Pancake. ==References== Category:Snack foods Category:British food Category:Australian food Category:Irish food",
