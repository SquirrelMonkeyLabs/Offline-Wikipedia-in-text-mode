 "text": "The Statute of Westminster 1931 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was passed on 11 December 1931. The Act gave equality to the self- governing dominions of the British Empire. It is still law in each of the Commonwealth realms. The Statute is important because it gave legislative freedom to these countries. Its current relevance is that it sets the basis for the continuing relationship between the Commonwealth realms and the Crown. ==References== Category:1931 Category:1930s in Europe Category:20th century in the United Kingdom Category:Commonwealth of Nations Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom",
