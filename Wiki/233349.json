He was well known for singing the title role in Elgar's oratorio, The Dream of Gerontius. Benjamin Britten wrote much of his vocal music and main operatic roles for his friend Peter Pears. Langridge had the same sort of lyrical tenor voice as Pears, and he became famous for his singing of Britten’s music, e.g. the title role in Peter Grimes, Peter Quint in The Turn of the Screw, Captain Vere in Billy Budd and Aschenbach in Death in Venice. Langridge sang in several operas by Harrison Birtwistle: he sang The Lawyer in the first recording of Punch and Judy (1989) and he sang the part of Kong in the first performances of The Second Mrs Kong at Glyndebourne in 1994.and Hiereus in The Minotaur at the (Royal Opera House in 2008).
