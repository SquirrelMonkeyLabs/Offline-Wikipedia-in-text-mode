In 1838 he obtained the chair of landscape painting, which had just been established at the Accademia di Brera. Brother of Michele Bisi, he was the husband of the artist Ernesta Legnani, whom he had married in 1811 with whom he had nine daughters. His daughters Raffaela, Antonietta and Fulvia Bisi.
