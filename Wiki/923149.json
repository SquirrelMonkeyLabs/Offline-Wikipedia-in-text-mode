 "text": "Zoning is a method of urban planning. A local government divides land into areas called zones. Each of these has regulations for new development different from other zones. Zones may be defined for a single use (e.g. residential, industrial), or they may combine several uses. Regulations may govern the density, size and shape of buildings, whatever their use. Zoning laws that limit the construction of new housing may be a big factor in segregation in the United States by income and race. Some countries, like the United Kingdom, have town planning, but not strict zoning == References == Category:Urban planning Category:Towns",
