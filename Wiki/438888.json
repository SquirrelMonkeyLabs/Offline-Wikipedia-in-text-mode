 "text": "The American lion (Panthera leo or P. atrox) is also known as Naegele’s giant jaguar or American cave lion. It is an extinct species of lion which lived in North America during the Pleistocene (340,000 years ago to 11,000 years ago). It existed for about 330,000 thousand years. The American lion belonged to the family Felidae. By analysing the species' genes, scientists have shown that it shared the same ancestor as the Eurasian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea or P. spelaea). Most remains have come from the La Brea tar pits. The American lion was large, slightly larger than the early middle Pleistocene cave lion, P. leo fossilis and about 40% larger than the modern African lion.Deméré, Tom 2009. SDNHM Fossil Field Guide: Panthera atrox There is no evidence that it was a social hunter like the modern lion, and that may explain its size. Panthera leo atrox hunted large mammals such as horses, camels, bison and mammoth. == References == Category:Lions Category:Mammals of North America Category:Extinct mammals",
