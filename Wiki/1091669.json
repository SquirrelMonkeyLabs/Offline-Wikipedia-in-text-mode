 "text": "A monogram is a style of design created by combining and overlapping two or more letters to form one single symbol. ==History== Monograms were first used on coins from as early as 350 BC. The earliest known examples are of the names of Greek cities which issued the coins, often the first two letters of the city's name. For example, the monogram of Achaea consisted of the letters alpha (Α) and chi (Χ) joined together.Henry Noel Humphreys, The Coin Collector's Manual, Or Guide to Numismatic Student in the Formation of a Cabinet of Coins (Bibliolife, 2008), 226. Monograms have been used as signatures by artists and craft workers on paintings, sculptures and pieces of furniture. ==References== Category:Letters",
