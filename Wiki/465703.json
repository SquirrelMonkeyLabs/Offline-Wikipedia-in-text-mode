The lyrics are about Lopez making rules for her lover before starting a relationship. The song was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1999. The music video was directed by Paul Hunter and filmed in April 1999. It features a voyeuristic Internet concept in which Lopez's viewers are able to direct her through cyberspace. The provocative music video received frequent airplay on MTV networks worldwide, allowing Lopez to establish herself in a field dominated by Janet Jackson and Madonna. The video was nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards and five Billboard Music Awards. Lopez promoted \"If You Had My Love\" at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards in 1999. She has subsequently performed it on numerous occasions, including at her 2001 Let's Get Loud concerts and 2012's Dance Again World Tour, where she performed an acoustic version of the song.
