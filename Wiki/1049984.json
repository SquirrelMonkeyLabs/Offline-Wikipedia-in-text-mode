 "text": "A cinnamon roll is a sweet roll from Sweden. The Swedish word for it is kanelbulle. A cinnamon roll is a rolled sheet of dough onto which a cinnamon and sugar mixture (or other ingredients) is mixed with butter. The dough is rolled, cut and baked. The deep fried version is called a cinnamon bun doughnut. Its ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide flavor. == History == Roman traders introduced cinnamon to Europe. Later, Sweden began using it in pastries, developing the kanelbulle. Since 1999, October 4 has been Cinnamon Roll Day. Swedish dough also contains cardamom, giving it a distinctive flavor. Haga, Gothenburg is known for large cinnamon rolls. These are called hagabullar. Hagabullar are usually or more and are not a shared roll. Each person usually orders one.
