Vexilloids are characteristic of traditional societies and ancient empires (Flags did not come into general use until medieval times.). A vexilloid consists of a staff held upright with a cloth banner that hangs down vertically on the staff and on top of the staff is an emblem, such as a carved animal. == Literature == Whitney Smith, Flags Through the Ages and Across the World, Category:Flags",
