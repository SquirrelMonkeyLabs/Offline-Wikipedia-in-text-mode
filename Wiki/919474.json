 "text": "Human rights in Indonesia are defined by the 1945 Constitution (UUD 1945) and the laws under it. Some rights were only given after the Reform era. The Ministry of Law and Human Rights deals with human rights issues in the cabinet. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) is the country's national human rights institution. Actions by the government of Indonesia have been noted as concerning by advocates for human rights. ==LGBT rights in the country == In 1982, the first gay rights interest group was established in Indonesia. \"Lambda Indonesia\" and other similar organisations arose in the late 1980s and 1990s. Today, some of the major LGBT associations in the nation include \"GAYa NUSANTARA\" and \"Arus Pelangi\". ==References== Indonesia Category:Politics of Indonesia",
