 "text": "Oriole Park at Camden Yards, also called Oriole Park or Camden Yards, is a baseball park in Baltimore, Maryland. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Baltimore Orioles. It opened in 1992, replacing the Orioles' long-time home Memorial Stadium. The ballpark was built on the site of a railroad area called Camden Yards. The long brick building outside the right field area was part of that rail yard. The birthplace of Babe Ruth is also nearby. It is a museum which is a couple of blocks west of the ballpark. == References == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
