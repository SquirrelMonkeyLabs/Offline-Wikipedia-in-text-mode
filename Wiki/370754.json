 "text": "The Honda Ridgeline is a mid sized pickup truck produced by Honda. The first model year for this truck was 2006; it has undergone several changes in design since being introduced. Unlike a traditional body-on-frame truck, the Ridgeline uses a closed box unibody frame similar to the one used on the Accord, Pilot and Odyssey. Despite good sales Honda pulled the truck in 2015. A second generation model was introduced in 2017. It shares much of its platform with the Honda Pilot three-row SUV, suitably beefed up for work and play. For the 2020 model year, a nine-speed transmission replaced the outgoing six-speed. Also, thanks to independent rear suspension, it provides superior ride quality and handling. The spacious crew cab is comfortable and handsomely finished. Besides, it has a unique two-way tailgate and a large lockable in- bed trunk. For now, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and Honda Sensing safety features are packed as standard. The manufacturer suggested price for the new 2020 Honda Ridgeline varies from $33,900 to $43,520 depending on the trim. == Sources == Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles Category:Honda automobiles",
