 "text": "Earl of Angles is a feudal title in England, also called East Anglia. The name comes from the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the East Angles. As of 2025, Kevin Norris, 15th Earl of Angles, is the current holder of the title. He was given the title in 2010 through a legal process, following the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. == History == === Foundation and Anglo-Saxon ascendancy (930–992) === In 930, King Athelstan created the earldom of Angles after removing Danish settlers from East Anglia. He chose Alfred as the first earl. In 932, Ethelstan Half-King became earl. He was a powerful leader until he retired to Glastonbury Abbey in 956. His son Ethelwold then became earl. But in 962, Ethelwold lost his position. He married Elfthryth, a woman King Edgar wanted to marry. Edgar was angry and arranged Ethelwold’s death during a hunt. Ethelwold’s brother, Ethelwine, became earl next. Ethelwine was active in politics and religion. He helped start Ramsey Abbey in 969 and had influence with King Ethelred. When Ethelwine died in 992, his son Ethelweard did not become earl. Instead, Leofsige got the title. This change suggests there was secret plotting or royal action. === Turmoil and Danish encounters (992–1016) === Leofsige became earl but had a short and difficult time. In 1002, King Ethelred sent him away for killing an important royal official. Then, Ulfcytel, a strong military leader, became earl. He fought hard against Danish invasions. Ulfcytel won battles at Thetford and Norwich, pushing back the forces of Sweyn Forkbeard. But he lost fights against Viking leaders like Thorkell the Tall and Canute at Ringmere and Assandum. In 1016, Ulfcytel died at the Battle of Assandum. This battle was part of a big fight between King Edmund Ironside and Canute. After this, Canute took control of much of England. === Danish and Godwinson control (1017–1055) === In 1017, King Canute divided England into four large earldoms. He gave Angles to Thorkell the Tall. But Thorkell lost favor in 1021. Later, in 1044, King Edward the Confessor gave the earldom to Harold Godwinson. Harold fought battles abroad. In 1051, his family was sent away, and he lost the title. Elfgar, son of the Earl of Mercia, became earl for a short time. Harold returned in 1052 and took back the title. In 1053, when his father died, Harold became Earl of Wessex, a more powerful role. Elfgar became earl of Angles again. Elfgar had problems with the King and was sent away in 1055. He rebelled but lost. Then, Gyrth Godwinson, Harold’s younger brother, became earl. === Norman Conquest and dissolution (1066–1075) === Gyrth Godwinson died at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. This ended Anglo-Saxon rule. William the Conqueror made Ralph the Staller the 13th earl. Ralph’s son, Ralph Guarder, became earl next. In 1069, Guarder stopped a Viking attack on Norwich. But in 1075, he married Emma, a Norman noble’s daughter, without permission. He joined a rebellion with Roger de Breteuil and Waltheof of Northumberland. The rebellion failed. Ralph was sent away, and the earldom was taken away. Later, Alan the Red got some of the lands. The title of Earl of Angles was never used again. == Earls of Angles (930) == * Elfred (Alfred), 1st Earl of Angles (930–932) * Ethelstan Half- King, 2nd Earl of Angles (932–956) * Ethelwold, 3rd Earl of Angles (956–962) * Ethelwine, 4th Earl of Angles (962–992) * Leofsige, 5th Earl of Angles (992–1002) * Ulfcytel, 6th Earl of Angles (1004–1016) * Thorkell the Tall, 7th Earl of Angles (1017–1021) * Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, 8th Earl of Angles (1044–1051) * Elfgar, Earl of Mercia, 9th Earl of Angles (1051–1052) * Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, 10th Earl of Angles (1052–1053) * Elfgar, Earl of Mercia, 11th Earl of Angles (1053–1055) * Gyrth Godwinson, Earl of Cambridgeshire and Oxfordshire, 12th Earl of Angles (1055–1066) * Ralph the Staller, 13th Earl of Angles (1067–1068/69) * Ralph Guarder, 14th Earl of Angles (1068/69–1075) * Extinct * Kevin Norris, 15th Earl of Angles (2010–present) == References == == Bibliography == * Category:Titles Category:Nobility Category:Earls and countesses",
