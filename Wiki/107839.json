Early Choctaw lived in thatched-roof cabins of logs in communities. Agriculture was the main supply of food, such as the Three Sisters. There was also fishing and hunting. Sports were also important and often replaced war. The tribe supported the Americans during the American Revolution, the War of 1812 and the Creek War. Europeans thought the tribe was civilized. It was part of the so-called \"Five Civilized Tribes\" of the Southeast.Zinn, Howard (2003). \"As Long as Grass Grows or Water Runs\". A People's History of the United States: 1492–Present. HarperCollins. p. 126. ISBN 0-06-052842-7. Most of the tribe was forced out of their land from 1831 to 1833. This was part of the Indian Removal. The remaining Choctaw became citizens. The tribe supported the Confederates in the U.S. Civil War. Several chiefs of the Choctaw were at the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. Choctaw worked as codetalkers during World War I. They used their own Choctaw language. The Choctaw reorganized after the Indian Reorganization Act. == References == Category:Native Americans",
