Mother Gothel, an elderly witch, has hoarded the flower's healing magic to keep herself young for many centuries, and is furious when soldiers from a nearby kingdom pluck it and give it to their sick, pregnant queen. Afterwards, the queen gives birth to a baby girl, Rapunzel, whose long, blonde hair contains the flower's healing properties. Gothel breaks into the palace at night to cut Rapunzel's hair and to use the magic once again, but discovers that cutting her hair will render it useless, so she steals the baby and puts her in a tower in the woods, where she raises her, lying to the girl about the dangers of the outside world to keep her safe and content. Meanwhile, every year on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release floating lanterns in the hopes their daughter will see them and come home. Knowing the lanterns are made for her, on the eve of her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel plucks up the courage to ask Gothel's permission to see the lanterns and discover their source, but she refuses. Meanwhile, in the kingdom, the dashing bandit Flynn Rider, steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace, and abandons his partners, the Stabbington brothers, while they flee. He takes refuge with the crown in the tower, but Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan, and hides him in her wardrobe. Upon Gothel's return, Rapunzel tries to show Flynn to her to convince her she's ready for the \"dangerous\" world, but is still dismissed. Rapunzel sends Gothel away on a three-day trip to pick up some paints for her. When Gothel leaves, Rapunzel hides the crown from Flynn and uses it as leverage as a means to get him to take her to the lanterns on her birthday. On their journey, Flynn and Rapunzel stop over at the Snuggly Duckling, a tavern filled with menacing barbarian thugs, who try to capture Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them. Meanwhile, Gothel comes across Maximus, a palace horse who is pursuing Flynn. Realizing the palace guards may be closing on the tower, Gothel rushes back only to discover that Rapunzel is missing, but finds Flynn's satchel with the crown, and she goes after the pair. The soldiers, led by Maximus, search the tavern for Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape through a secret passage, but end up trapped in a flooding cavern. Resigned to their fate, Flynn reveals his real name is Eugene, and Rapunzel reveals her hair glows when she sings. Using the light from Rapunzel's hair, they escape the cavern and hide in the woods. Meanwhile, Gothel teams up with the Stabbingtons and gives the crown to Rapunzel as a test of Eugene's loyalty. The next morning, Maximus arrives to arrest Eugene, but Rapunzel talks him into calling a truce with him for her birthday. Rapunzel and Eugene arrive at the kingdom and enjoy the festivities, with an evening boat ride as the King, Queen, and citizens release lanterns. As a thank you for fulfilling her dream to see the lanterns, Rapunzel gives Eugene the satchel with the crown. They confess their love, and just as the two are about to kiss, Eugene sees the Stabbingtons on the lakeside, and rows the boat over to apologize and hand the crown over to them. However, the brothers assault him and tie him to a boat heading for the palace. While Eugene is taken into custody by the guards, Gothel stages a rescue by disabling the brothers, and returns to the tower with Rapunzel. Back at the tower, Rapunzel discovers the kingdom's sun symbol she has subconsciously incorporated into her artwork over the years. She realizes that she is the missing princess who the kingdom release the lanterns for, and angrily confronts Gothel. Meanwhile, Maximus and the thugs free Eugene, who rides back to the tower, and enters, where he discovers Rapunzel has been chained and gagged. After stabbing Eugene, and leaving him to die of his injuries, Gothel tries to flee with the captive Rapunzel. She agrees she will willingly go with Gothel, if she can be free to heal Eugene. Not wanting her to be a captive any longer, Eugene cuts Rapunzel's hair, turning it brown causing its powers to dissipate. Gothel ages rapidly, and falls out the tower window, and is reduced to ash. Eugene confesses his love for Rapunzel, and dies of his injuries. As the heartbroken Rapunzel mourns, her tears, infused with the healing magic, bring Eugene back to life. When the two return to the kingdom, Rapunzel is reunited with her parents, who pardon Eugene. The kingdom rejoices, and after a time, Rapunzel and Eugene wed. ==Cast== * Mandy Moore – Rapunzel ** Delaney Rose Stein – young Rapunzel, Little Girl * Zachary Levi – Flynn Rider/Eugene Fitzherbert * Donna Murphy – Mother Gothel * Brad Garrett – Hook Hand Thug * Ron Perlman – Stabbington brother * Jeffrey Tambor – Big Nose Thug * Richard Kiel – Vlad * M.
