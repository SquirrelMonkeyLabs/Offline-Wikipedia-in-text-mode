 "text": "Plectrohyla chrysopleura is a frog that lives in Honduras. Scientists have seen it between 930 and 1550 meters above sea level. ==Name== The Latin name for this frog chrysopleura comes from the Greek words chrysos, for \"gold,\" and pleura for \"side.\" It is named after the yellow marks on the sides of its body. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 56.6 to 65.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 63.3 to 65.6 mm long. This frog has teeth. It has disks on its toes for climbing. This frog is gray in color with some bronze. It has yellow marks on its sides. Its eardrums are bronze or copper in color. Its belly is yellow-gray. Its legs are yellow and olive green. Adult female frogs and young frogs of both sexes have some dark brown color too. ==Home== This frog lays eggs in streams. ==Threats== Scientists think this frog is endangered because human beings change the places where it lives when they cut down trees for logging, turn forests into farms, or let cows and other animals eat grass in them. It is also endangered because of not enough rainfall, floods, and climate change. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis can also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
