 "text": "The Aragua poison frog (Mannophryne neblina) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== Scientists have seen the frogs in exactly one place, Portachuelo Pass, Rancho Grande, in Aragua, but scientists cannot find it there now. People say it also lives in Macizo de Nirgua in Yaracuy. This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams in cloud forests on hills and mountains. It lives in cloud forests that are growing back and in forests that were never cut down. This frog lives on the ground. Scientists saw the frog between 900 and 1100 meters above sea level. Scientists found the frog in Henri Pittier National Park. ==Young== Scientists are not sure how this frog make young, but they believe it does the same things as other frogs in Aromobatidae: The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. Scientists saw male frogs carrying tadpoles to water after the eggs hatched. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. Outside of Henri Pittier National Park, people change the forests where it lives to make small farms for coffee, cocoa, and food to eat and to build towns. People also tourism visit the park without the government telling them where or how, and sometimes people set fires. Scientists think the frog disappeared from Aragua because of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis, which has killed many other frogs in South America. Scientits have found the fungus that causes the disease, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, on Mannophyrne neblina frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
