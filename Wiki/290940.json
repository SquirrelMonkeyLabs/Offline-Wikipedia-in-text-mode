 "text": "A Lego minifigure (a.k.a. Lego person) is a small figure as part of Lego toys. Minifigures are found in Lego sets, although they are also sold separately as keychains and magnets, and they can also can be found in Lego minifigures bags. Minifigures in 1975 were the same size as minifigures today, but they did not have any moving arms or legs. They had a small variety of headpieces, including caps, pigtail hair, and cowboy hats. Since 1978, Lego minifigures have had movable arms, legs, and hands. They also have had more clothing, hats, shirts and pants to choose from. Lego started packing minifigures in sets, starting with Town, Castle, and Space. Minifigures are used in many Lego sets today. There are many minifigures such as mermaids with a identical tail to the ocean king and many shorter characters such as dwarves. Category:Lego",
