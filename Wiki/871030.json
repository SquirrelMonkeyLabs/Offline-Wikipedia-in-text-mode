 "text": "Chestnut flour, also called sweet flour, is a flour made by grinding chestnuts. It has a hazelnut-like color and a sweet flavour. It is mainly made in Italian mountain regions, which is between 450 to 900 meters above sea level, where the sweet chestnut can be found. In the past, it was a important source for the regions as it is high in energy. The chestnut in the time of San Benedetto was intensively cultivated due to famines and the plague in Tuscany in the 1300s that led the population to move in for finding support at the hills. In Corsica, chestnut trees were introduced in the 16th century by the Genoese, and their spread had changed the culture of the island including its food. == References == Category:Flour",
