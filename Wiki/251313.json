 "text": "Saltopus was a small, lightly-built Upper Triassic reptile. So few bones were found that its exact nature is not known. It was 60 centimeters (23 in) long, not much bigger than a rabbit, and was discovered in Scotland by Friedrich von Huene in 1910. It was a carnivore. Not much more can be said until more remains are discovered. Category:Reptiles Category:Fossils",
