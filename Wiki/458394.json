 "text": "Giorgio Gaslini (October 22, 1929 â€“ July 29, 2014) was an Italian jazz pianist and composer. Gaslini was born in Milan, Italy. In the 1950s and 1960s Gaslini performed with his own quartet. He was the first Italian musician mentioned as a \"new talent\" in the Down Beat poll and the first Italian officially invited to a jazz festival in the USA (New Orleans 1976-77). He worked with leading American soloists, such as Anthony Braxton, Steve Lacy, Don Cherry, Roswell Rudd, Eddie Gomez, Max Roach, Nacci Alberto, but also with the Argentinian Gato Barbieri and Frenchman Jean-Luc Ponty. He has also adapted the compositions of Albert Ayler and Sun Ra for solo piano, which the Soul Note label has issued. He also composed the soundtrack of Michelangelo Antonioni's La notte (The Night, 1961). Gaslini died in Borgo Val di Taro, Italy from complications from a fall, aged 84. ==References== ==Other websites== *Music match guide *One Final Note profile of Gaslini *Giorgio Gaslini's official site Category:1929 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Musicians from Milan Category:Italian jazz musicians Category:Italian pianists Category:20th-century Italian composers Category:21st-century Italian composers",
