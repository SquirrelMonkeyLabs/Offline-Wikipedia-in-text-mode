 "text": "Viola Irene Desmond (July 6, 1914 â€“ February 7, 1965) was a civil rights activist in Canada. In 1946 she went into a segregated part of a movie theatre and would not leave. Then she was charged with tax evasion because the seats cost one cent less there. This event turned into a very well-known example of discrimination. Desmond was born in 1914 and died in 1965. She was pardoned from the tax evasion charge in 2010. ==References== Category:1914 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Civil rights activists Category:Canadian activists Category:People from Nova Scotia",
