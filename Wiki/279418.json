 "text": "A Wilson prime is a special kind of prime number. A prime number p is a Wilson prime if (and only if [ \\iff ]) \\frac{(p-1)!+1}{p^2}=n where n is a positive integer (sometimes called natural number). Wilson primes were first described by Emma Lehmer.On congruences involving Bernoulli numbers and the quotients of Fermat and Wilson, Ann. of. Math. 39(1938), 350-360. The only known Wilson primes are 5, 13, and 563 ; if any others exist, they must be greater than 5.Status of the search for Wilson primes, also see Crandall et al. 1997 It has been conjecturedThe Prime Glossary: Wilson prime that there are an infinite number of Wilson primes, and that the number of Wilson primes in an interval [x,y] is about \\frac{\\log \\left ( \\log y \\right )}{\\log x}. Compare this with Wilson's theorem, which states that every prime p divides (p âˆ’ 1)! + 1. == Related pages == * Wall-Sun-Sun prime * Wieferich prime * Wolstenholme prime ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * The Prime Glossary: Wilson prime * * Status of the search for Wilson primes * Wilson Quotients for composite moduli * On congruences involving Bernoulli numbers and the quotients of Fermat and Wilson Category:Classes of prime numbers",
