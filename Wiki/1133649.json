Site Image Location Year listed Description Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro Sindh 1980 138; ii, iii (cultural) Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation and was the first planned city in South Asia. Located on the banks of the Indus River, it flourished between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE. The city was mostly built with baked brick and followed a strict grid plan. There were public baths, a granary, and an elaborate drainage system. A Buddhist stupa was built over the ruins in the 2nd century CE. The excavations at the site have been ongoing since 1922, with about one third of the city having been explored so far. Taxila Punjab 1980 139; iii, vi (cultural) Taxila, which was already inhabited in the Neolithic, was an important Buddhist centre of learning between the 5th century BCE and 2nd century CE. The archaeological site comprises the remains of four settlements which reveal the urban development of the site. The city was located on one of the branches of the Silk Road and was influenced by the Achaemenid Empire and by the Greeks. The Bhir Mound is associated with the entrance of Alexander the Great into Taxila in 326 BCE. Some of the monuments include the Jaulian monastery, the Mohra Muradu stupa, the Dharmarajika Stupa, the Jandial complex, and the city of Sirkap (the remains of a stupa at the site pictured). Buddhist Ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Neighbouring City Remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 1980 140; iv (cultural) The Buddhist monastery of Takht-i- Bahi (pictured) was founded in the 1st century CE and remained in use until the 7th century. Due to its location on the crest of a steep hill, it remained well preserved despite successive invasions of the region. The monastery and the remains of the nearby city of Seri Bahlol from the Kushan period are some of the most important Buddhist monuments in the Gandhara region. The monastery is the most complete Buddhist monastery in Pakistan and comprises several groups of stupas, monastic cells, temples, and secular buildings. Historical Monuments at Makli, Thatta Sindh 1981 143; iii (cultural) Makli is a large necropolis in the city of Thatta. It was active between the 14th and 18th centuries. The monuments and mausoleums are built from high quality stone, brick, and glazed tiles. Tombs of famous saints and rulers including Jam Nizamuddin II and Isa Khan (pictured) are still preserved and are fine examples of Mughal architecture influenced by local styles. Fort and Shalimar Gardens in Lahore Punjab 1981 171; i, ii, iii (cultural) The Fort (pictured) and the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore are two royal complexes from the Mughal era. The Fort is located at the northwest corner of the Walled City of Lahore and has been destroyed and rebuilt several times during its history. The extant monuments date from the 16th century, during the reign of Akbar. The Shalimar Gardens were constructed under the emperor Shah Jahan in 1642. They are an example of Mughal gardens which were influenced by Persian and Islamic traditions. Rohtas Fort Punjab 1997 586; ii, iv (cultural) The fort was constructed under Sher Shah Suri, following his victory over the Mughal Emperor Humayun in 1541. It is an exceptional example of early Islamic military architecture in the gunpowder era, integrating artistic traditions from Turkey and the Indian subcontinent. It served as a model for the later Mughal architecture. It was never conquered in battle and remains intact today. == References == Category:Lists of World Heritage sites Category:Pakistan",
