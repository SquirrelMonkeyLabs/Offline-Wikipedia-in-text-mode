 "text": "A throw-in in football (soccer) is when the ball has come off the opposite team, the other team picks that ball up and throws it in and the game continues. ==Rules== *The throw-in is made at the place, where the ball left the field. *The throw in is delivered by the team who has not touched the ball before he left the field. *The thrower must look to the field of play. *He must stand with both feet on the ground on or outside the touch line . *He must use both hands to throw the ball from behind and over their head. *You can not score a goal directly after a throw in. *The opposite players must stand at least 2 meters away. *During the throw-in the offside rule is not used. ==Other facts== *The best way to do a throw in is to throw the ball in an angle of about 30 degrees. Then you can reach the maximum distance. *Rory Delap, a midfielder for Stoke City is known for his long-throw ins which led to many goals for Stoke City. *Also Christian Schwegler of FC Red Bull Salzburg is known for his throw ins. ==References== Category:Football (soccer) terminology",
