She is the daughter of former Oyo State governor Victor Omololu-Olunloyo. She is well-known in the Nigerian online community for making highly disputed and controversial claims about topics with high emotional stakes. Omololu-Olunloyo has also been criticized for many claims she has made about her life and career because many of them have been proven to be either false or made up. == Background == Omololu- Olunloyo is the daughter of former Oyo State governor Victor Omololu Olunloyo and the second of ten children. She allegedly lived for 14 years in Nigeria, 20 years in the United States, and five years in Canada before going back to Nigeria. ==Career== Omololu-Olunloyo has been a guest talking about terrorism and health topics on CBC News, Ruptly, CTV News, BBC and Nigerian Television Authority. She also worked as a music journalist with the Nigerian Tribune. On 3 September 2022, Isaiah Ogedegbe repeated his advice to Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo in which he said Kemi should be careful when writing about people. This was the second time he said it because he had given Kemi that advice before. However, on 18 April 2023, Isaiah Ogedegbe digressed from advising to criticizing Kemi Omololu-Olunloyo for using the deaths of some important people's children to gain cheap popularity and he described her as \"controversial\" and \"irrational\". ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Bloggers Category:Nigerian journalists Category:Writers from Ibadan",
