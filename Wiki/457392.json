In contrast, a U.S. Sheriff is generally elected by the voters of a county.Except in the states of Rhode Island and Hawaii.Jeffrey J. Noble; Geoffrey P. Alpert, Managing Accountability Systems for Police Conduct: Internal Affairs and External Oversight (Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press, 2009), p. 176 Some states have both an appointed and an elected Chief of Police (Louisiana).

A chief is responsible for the budget of a police department. He or she is also responsible for the conduct of all police officers in the department. In larger police departments, a chief can delegate some of his responsibilities to an assistant Chief (Deputy Chief, etc.).Larry Gaines; John Worrall, Police Administration (Clifton Park, NY : Delmar/Cengage, 2012), p. 176 == United Kingdom == Chief police officer is a phrase used in the United Kingdom to describe the position of the most senior police officer in a police force. It refers to the 53 Chief Constables, the Commissioner of the City of London Police or the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. They are members of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The phrase is used in legislation on the power to permit public processions, or grant firearms licenses. Many routine activities are delegated to constables. No police officers in the UK are elected. There is a mixed system of control by local and central government, and local committees act in advice and supervision. Various organisations are permitted to hire and control their own security forces: the armed forces, the railways, certain branches of the security services,The police working for security services such as MI5 are traditionally known as \"Special Branch\". and a number of private organisations. == North America == Policing in Canada is usually the responsibility of the province.International Police Cooperation: A World Perspective, ed. Daniel J. Koenig, Dilip K. Das (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2001), pp. 38-41 Usually police chiefs run the police departments.

Daniel J. Koenig, Dilip K. Das (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2001), pp. 38-41 They work in close cooperation with police chiefs to exchange methods and ideas. Many councils take these ideas directly to their governments which often put them into effect. Regional and sub-regional chiefs of police councils are set up in most parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. North and South American have functioning councils that work with Interpol. Central American councils are a work in progress. == References == == Other websites == * International Association of Chiefs of Police Category:Law enforcement occupations",
