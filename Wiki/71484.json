 "text": "Thymine, or 5-methyluracil, is a pyrimidine base found in the nucleic acid DNA. In RNA thymine is swapped for uracil to represent the same genetic information. In DNA, thymine (T) connects to adenine (A) by two hydrogen bonds. These pair bonds hold the two strands of the DNA double helix structure together. == Other websites == * Computational Chemistry Wiki Category:Organonitrogen compounds Category:DNA",
