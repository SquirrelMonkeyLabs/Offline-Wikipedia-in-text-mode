(Spanish) ==Possible explanations== ===Natural=== The reason for the rain of fish is weather related, often to be strong winds or waterspouts, as is common when attempting to explain similar occurrences of raining animals. The nearest habitat for the fish is the Atlantic Ocean, about away. Alternatively, the fish may have originated in fresh water and moved from a nearby river into a water current or cave system in response to seasonal changes. Subsequent heavy rains wash the fish up out of this habitat and the water level decreases to leave the fish stranded. ===Father Subirana miracle=== Spanish priest Father José Manuel de Jesús Subirana was a figure in the history of Christianity in Honduras. He arrived in Honduras in 1855 and worked there until his death in 1864. Today the name of Father Subirana is linked with the legend of the Yoro fish rain. The legend goes as follows: \"Father Subirana saw how poor the people of Honduras were and prayed three days and three nights asking God for a miracle to help the poor people and to provide them with food. After these three days and nights, God took note of this and there came a dark cloud. Many fish fell from the sky, feeding all the people.\" ==References== Category:Fish Category:Traditions Category:Festivals",
