 "text": "Eradication is the lowering of an infectious disease's numbers in all those suffering from it in the world's population to zero. It is sometimes confused with elimination of infectious diseases. That is the lowering of an infectious disease's numbers in all those suffering from it in a local population to zero. The only human disease to be eradicated is smallpox. The only animal disease eradicated is rinderpest. Year: 2022 Rinderpest and its eradication. WILLIAM TAYLOR, E. PAUL J. GIBBS, SANTANU K.

Vaccination is vitally important to current polio eradication efforts. Vaccination is vitally important to current measles eradication efforts.2014\\. Review article. Volume 369. . The World Organisation for Animal Health thinks the animal diseases which could be soonest eradicated are African swine fever, Bovine tuberculosis, Foot and mouth disease and Peste des petits ruminants (PPR, ovine rinderpest). A disease which is easier to eradicate is more eradicable. A disease which is easier to eradicate has a higher eradicability. Former President of the United States of America Carter wants to make Guinea Worm the 2nd eradicated human disease. The Carter Center's International Task Force for Disease Eradication works to achieve this goal. The Covid pandemic slowed many eradication efforts. Eradication requires many resources. For this reason it is hard to decide whether to eradicate a disease or not. When deciding people consider: Does the disease have a secondary host? (A secondary host will still have the disease if the disease is eradicated in humans.) Can we clearly identify who has the disease? Does an accurate diagnostic exist? Is there enough money? Is there enough political support? It is possible that eradication of human disease is only possible if humans are the only host. ==COVID-19== Elimination of COVID-19 is only possible if travel is severely reduced. Some experts think this disease may have slightly higher eradicability than polio. The same experts think this disease has much lower eradicability than smallpox. They think this because they did mathematics with scientific data. This is not merely their opinion. :This is for most people. : :. 2021. .

Malaria has been eliminated from most of Europe, North America, Australia, North Africa and the Caribbean, and parts of South America, Asia and Southern Africa. Each elimination is a step in the process of eradication. One of the things causing malaria in humans is P. knowlesi. This parasite makes eradication more complicated. knowlesi makes eradication more complicated because knowlesis transmission is different. knowlesis transmission is mostly zoonotic. (\"Zoonotic\" means that in order to eradicate Plasmodium knowlesi we would need to kill all the animals that have it.). . Volume 21. Article number: 140. Review.

The United States of America eliminated malaria in 1951. The National Malaria Eradication Program was the idea of Dr. L. L. Williams.. Elimination of Malaria in the United States (1947 — 1951). In 2003 there were 8 cases of malaria in Florida. These cases were endemically transmitted. This means these infections happened entirely within the same area. Experts determined they didn't come from somewhere else. Endemic transmission is a serious failure of disease elimination. In 2023 endemic transmission occurred in Florida and Texas. These infections were caused by Plasmodium vivax. On August 18, 2023 there was an announcement. It was announced that malaria has returned to Maryland. This infection was caused by Plasmodium falciparum. This announcement shows that Maryland's malaria elimination failed in 2023. It required more than 40 years for this failure to occur.2023\\. . The US eliminated malaria in 1951. How can it keep it under control now? The American Society for Microbiology believes these 3 transmissions are not related.

Experts believe these mosquitoes will be used to eradicate malaria from the United States of America.January 26, 2024 at 5:01 AM EST. . New gene-editing tools may help wipe out mosquito-borne diseases. Malaria was eliminated from Sardinia. This elimination is thanks to the eradication of 3 of 4 mosquito species. These 4 species were Sardinia's native mosquito species. These eradications were done with large amounts of DDT. These eradications were done by a programme started in 1944. This was funded by the Italian government and the Rockefeller Foundation. Malaria was eliminated from Europe in 1975. Malaria eradication is difficult for several reasons. One of those reasons is the difficulty of detecting early infections. The development of technologies to detect hemozoin is making malaria eradication easier. Hemozoin is among the few things that could be detectable early in the infection process.2023\\. Open access. Page 70. Volume 15. Review Article. . .

No vaccine or medicine is available to help eradicate it. For this reason eradication is done entirely by preventive methods. These preventive methods include: Individuals who suspect they are infected voluntarily report themselves to eradication workers or eradication volunteers; filter vectors of D. medinensis out of drinking water; obtain drinking water from water sources which have been improved in ways which keep out D. medinensis; prevent individuals infected with D. medinensis from wading or swimming in drinking-water sources; eradication workers actively look for new cases; eradication workers do case containment when they find an infected individual; eradication vector control; provide water sources which have been improved in ways which keep out D. medinensis. Methods to improve drinking water sources include: protect hand-dug wells from D. medinensis; sink deep- bore wells which are too deep for D. medinensis; improve existing surface drinking-water sources to exclude D. medinensis; make surface water safe by using sand filters to remove D. medinensis. Improve existing surface drinking- water sources means: construct barriers to prevent humans with D. medinensis from entering the water. :2013. :Review article. :Dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease): eradication without a drug or a vaccine. :Gautam Biswas :Dieudonne P.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis recommends using a combination of 2 methods. These 2 methods are mass drug administration and integrated vector management. There are many methods of pathogen eradication. Methods include: harming and/or helping secondary hosts. In this case \"helping\" means giving secondary hosts more disease resistance. (In this case \"secondary hosts\" are living things other than humans. Those living things can also have the disease we are eradicating.) These secondary hosts include Aedes spp., Anopheles spp. and white-footed mice. Aedes spp. can carry dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Anopheles spp. can carry malaria. White-footed mice can carry the Lyme disease bacterium.2020\\. Volume 370. Issue 6523. Pages 1417-1419. . .

Nancy Leys Stepan. . . Chapter 6 Could we/should we eradicate mosquitoes? Vectors to be eradicated very frequently include mosquitoes. In 1944 Sardinia had 4 native mosquito species. In 1944 the Italian government and the Rockefeller Foundation initiated and funded a programme which attempted to eradicate Sardinia's mosquitoes. It succeeded in eradicating 3 of these species. This programme worked by using large amounts of DDT. The results of this programme teach us about what vector eradication does to the environment. Some experts believe this teaches us that vector eradication is not necessarily disastrous. Eradicating Sardinia's mosquitoes has not produced any ecological consequences. One example is Anopheles gambiae: Some experts want to eradicate Anopheles gambiae. Eradicating Anopheles gambiae will help eradicate malaria. There are environmental risks associated with eradicating Anopheles gambiae. Some experts believe we should ignore those risks and do it anyhow. They believe Anopheles gambiae has too little moral value to care about. One very good method of eradication of Anopheles gambiae is CRISPR gene drive.2022\\. Volume 19. Pages 371–380. . .
