 "text": "The third plague pandemic was a major bubonic plague pandemic. It began in Yunnan during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty in 1855. It gradually ended in the middle of the 20th century. The plague spread to Hong Kong, Guangzhou and other places in the 1890s, and then gradually spread to more than 60 countries and regions in the world. 15 million people worldwide died. In this plague, from 1898 to 1908, about six million people died in India. Other major epidemics include the Hong Kong plague and the Northeast plague. In 1894, Swiss-born French bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin successfully isolated Yersinia pestis in Hong Kong for the first time. In 1897, Russian borne French microbiologist Waldemar Haffkine invented the first human plague vaccine. == References == Category:1855 Category:19th century in China Category:20th century in China Category:19th century in India Category:20th century in India Category:Plague pandemics Plague 03 Plague 03",
