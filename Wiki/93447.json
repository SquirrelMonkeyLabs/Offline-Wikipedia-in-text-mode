The three most common kinds are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. Other kinds of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis (when an area is invaded by bacteria). Osteoarthritis is when the cartilage in between two bones breaks down. This condition causes the bones to rub together. This kind of arthritis is more common in elderly people.

The most common places for this arthritis is in the wrists and the knuckles. It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40. Children and elderly people can also get this kind of arthritis. There are medicines to slow down the process of this disease. There are also some medicines to relieve pain. It is important to treat this kind of arthritis early. Gout causes severe pain and swelling. Gout normally affects the big toe. It can also affect heels, ankles, hands, wrists or elbows. Gout is from high levels of uric acid that is in the blood. Gout can cause urate crystals to settle in tissues of joints. Gout creates stone-like shapes. The stone-like shapes build in joints, ligaments and tendons and the kidneys. Arthritis is more common in older people. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affect women more often than men. Animals, including dogs and cats, can also get arthritis. == References == Category:Diseases and disorders of joints Category:Inflammation",
