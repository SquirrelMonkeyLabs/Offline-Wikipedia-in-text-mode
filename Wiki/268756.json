The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography, p. 498. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003. Encyclopedia Britannica. Sir Jacob Epstein (British sculptor) He was born in the United States, and moved to Europe in 1902, becoming a British citizen in 1911. He often produced controversial works which challenged taboos on what was appropriate subject matter. His portrait heads were traditional, but much of his other work was modernist. He also made paintings and drawings, and often exhibited his work.Carrick Hill, Jacob Epstein The sculptures Ecce Homo (Old Coventry Cathedral) and Rock Drill (1913–1914, Museum of Modern Art, New York City), are famous and important, but we have no images of them. On view in the Strand, London near Trafalgar Square, are his sculptures for Zimbabwe House. There are a number of his busts (sculptures of heads) in the National Portrait Gallery, also near Trafalgar Square. == References == * Gilboa, Raquel 2009. ...And there was sculpture; Epstein's formative years (1880-1930), Lonodn, 2009 * Silber, Evelyn 1984.
