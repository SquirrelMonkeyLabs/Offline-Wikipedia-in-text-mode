 "text": "Atomic Bomberman is a video game developed by Interplay and Hudson Soft, and was released in 1996. The game was the first designed to run on a Microsoft Windows compatible PC, with the only previous PC versions running on DOS. Atomic Bomberman is known for its 10 player multi-player mode, PC and Microsoft Windows compatibility, and it's voice acting. The design of Bomberman is different from normal, appearing more like color coded astronauts, and are given a mouth (a green one is seen smiling on the main menu screen) despite Bomberman being usually not having one. Throughout play, including when players place cartoonish fuse bombs (Which explode in the players respective color), collect items, and trap or eliminate themselves or another player, various voice clips can be heard. These include \"Yup.\" when a bomb is planted, \"Dont make me come out there!\" And \"Times running out!\" when running out of time, and \"Ka-ching, Ka-ching!\" (\"Ka-ching\" being a phrase used to represent having a lot of money, and is an audibly pronounced version of the sound a cash register makes) When an item is collected. The voice actors used were the voices of Billy West and Charlie Adler, known for their roles in television shows and movies. Category:1997 video games Category:Bomberman Category:Windows games",
