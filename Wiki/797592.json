It earned €71.2 billion in revenues in 2016. EDF produces 120+ gigawatts of electricity in Europe, South America, North America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In 2009, EDF produced more electricity than any other power company in the world.AFP (August 2010) In 2011, it produced 22% of the European Union's electricity, most of it from nuclear power: *nuclear: 64.3%; *renewable energy: 12.3% (includes 4.6% from dams); *gas: 8.6%; *coal: 14.5%; *other: 0.3%. Its 58 active nuclear reactors (in France) are spread out over 20 sites (nuclear power plants). There are 34 reactors with 900 MWe, 20 reactors with 1300 MWe, and 4 reactors with 1450 MWe, all PWRs. In 2017, EDF was scheduled to take over most of the power business of Areva, in a French government sponsored restructuring following financial and technical problems at Areva. In July 2017, France's Environmental Minister Nicolas Hulot said that up to 17 of France's nuclear power reactors — all of which are operated by EDF — could be closed by 2025 because of a new law about using less nuclear power. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website Category:1946 establishments in France Category:Electric power companies Category:Energy companies of France",
