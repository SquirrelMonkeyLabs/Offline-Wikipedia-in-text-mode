 "text": "Pascal Siakam (born 2 April 1994) is a professional basketball player from Cameroon. He plays forward for the Indiana Pacers. Siakam grew up in Douala, Cameroon. He did not start playing baskeball until he was sixteen. He started after attending an annual basketball camp that his friends went to and got noticed by some of the organizers. He then received an invitation to attend a Basketball Without Borders camp in South Africa. One thing lead to the other and he ended up in Godâ€™s Academy, a prep school in Lewiston, Texas. He could not speak English and went through a Culture Shock, trying to get used to American customs and fast food. It was also tough for him physically. As he grew taller and developed some basketball skills he started standing out because of his inner drive. He would not let an opportunity to go by, chasing difficult balls and impossible rebounds. He was always working harder at it than the others. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Toronto Raptors players Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Douala",
