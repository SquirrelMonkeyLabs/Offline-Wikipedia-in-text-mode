 "text": "Bernhard Rensch (21 January 1900 – 4 April 1990) was a German evolutionary biologist, and ornithologist who did field work in Indonesia and India. He is probably best known as one of the architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis, which he popularised in Germany. His work on the evolution of geographically isolated populations, and on evolution above the species level, contributed to the modern synthesis. He also worked extensively on animal behavior (ethology). Rensch's education and scientific work was interrupted by service in the German military during both World War I and World War II. His autobiography, published later in life, translates as 'Life of a biologist in a turbulent century'.Rensch B. 1979. Lebensweg eines Biologen in einem turbulenten Jahrenhundert. A short memorial was published in Verh. Dtsch. Zool.
