 "text": "Super Why! is an animated superhero preschool educational television series created by Angela C. Santomero and developed by Santomero and Samantha Freeman Alpert for PBS Kids. Santomero and Alpert additionally serve as executive producers alongside Steven DeNure and Anne Loi. The series was produced by Santomero and Alpert's New York City-based production company Out of the Blue Enterprises in co-production with Decode Entertainment for the first season and DHX Studios Halifax for the second and third seasons. Animation was by Toronto-based C.O.R.E. Toons (season 1), Gallus Entertainment (season 2) and DHX Media (originally through its Decode Entertainment division). The opening and closing theme songs were written by composers and lyricists Steve D'Angelo and Terry Tompkins, with D'Angelo also providing lead vocals for both. The background score for seasons 2 and 3 was composed by Lorenzo Castelli and Jeff Morrow. The show was originally created as a stop motion pilot episode in 1999 by Cuppa Coffee Animation that was pitched to Nickelodeon/Nick Jr. It was later featured at the 2000 Annecy Film Festival. Nickelodeon ultimately opted not to pick up the show. Instead, Curious Pictures pitched another pilot to PBS Kids sometime in 2006, and PBS Kids further developed the series with funds from the United States Department of Education's Ready to Learn grant and aired the premiere episode on September 3, 2007. The original run ended on May 12, 2016 with a total of 103 episodes across three seasons. == Characters == * Whyatt Beanstalk becomes Super Why * Littlest Pig becomes Alpha Pig * Little Red Riding Hood becomes Wonder Red * Princess Pea becomes Princess Presto * Puppy becomes Woofster == Episodes list == === Season 1 (2007â€“10)=== No. in series No. in season Title Director Writer Storyboard Super Story Answer Original air date ==References== Category:2007 American television series debuts Category:2007 Canadian television series debuts Category:2007 television series debuts Category:2016 American television series endings Category:2016 Canadian television series endings Category:2016 television series endings Category:American television series Category:Canadian television series Category:Children's animated television series Category:Children's television series",
