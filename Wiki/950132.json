 "text": "The Palácio Monroe (Portuguese for \"Monroe Palace\") was a historic building in the Centro neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was named in honor of U.S. president James Monroe. It was originally built in the U.S. city of St. Louis to act as the Brazilian Pavilion during the 1904 World's Fair. After the World's Fair, the building was dismantled and transported in cargo ships to Rio de Janeiro, where it was rebuilt in 1906. From 1914 to 1920, the palace was used as the home of the Brazilian Congress and from 1925 to 1960 it was used as the home of the Brazilian Senate, when Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil. It was demolished in 1976 on the order of the President of Brazil Ernesto Geisel, despite protests. The reason for the building's demolition was to build the Rio de Janeiro Metro. In 1979, the Cinelândia Station was opened as one of the first five stations of the new metro, on the site of the demolished palace. ==Gallery== File:Palácio Monroe (funeral de Joaquim Nabuco).jpg|Palácio Monroe in 1910, during the funeral of the writer and politician Joaquim Nabuco.
