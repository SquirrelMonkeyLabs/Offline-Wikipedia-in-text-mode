It quickly became more intense and was promoted to hurricane status on July 24. The next day, it made landfall near Beaufort, South Carolina. It became one of a record-tying six hurricanes to hit the United States during a single season. Bob quickly weakened over land. It was absorbed by a frontal trough over eastern West Virginia on July 26. Bob caused $20 million in damage and five indirect deaths. In Florida, the storm produced heavy rainfall. It peaked at over in Everglades City. In most areas, the rainfall was beneficial due to dry conditions that had persisted throughout the year. Damage was minimal in South Carolina, where the hurricane made its final landfall. In Virginia, the storm spawned three tornadoes, one of which destroyed two houses. ==References== ==Other websites== * National Hurricane Center Preliminary Report on Hurricane Bob Category:1985 in the United States Bob (1985) Category:1980s in weather",
