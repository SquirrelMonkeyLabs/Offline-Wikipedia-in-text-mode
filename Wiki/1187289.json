 "text": "The 2nd Punic War was second war between the Roman Republic and Carthage. == Beginnings == After Carthage was defeated in the First Punic War, they had to deal with the Mercenary War, where all the soldiers they hired rebelled since they couldn't pay off Rome. The Romans took Sardinia and Corsica from the busy Carthaginians, and the tensions grew. One of the Carthaginian generals named Hamilcar Barca decided to go to Spain to regain riches to pay off Rome and expand Carthage. He took his son, Hannibal along with him. The two conquered a majority of the Iberian peninsula, and then Hamilcar was killed at the Jucar River. Hannibal took command, and then found the Roman ally Saguntum, and captured the city. The Romans declared war on the Carthaginians. == Early Stages == === Hannibal moves into Italy === Hannibal gathered his armies and crossed the Pyrenees into Gaul. He fought a Gallic tribe at the Battle of the Rhone Crossing and defeated them before making his famous crossing of the Swiss Alps. The journey across the mountains was hard and risky. Multiple men froze to death, entire groups of elephants jumped off, and thousands caught disease. Once across the Alps, Hannibal fought the Gallic tribes in Cisalpine Gaul whom he defeated. === Early Victories === The Roman Senate thought Hannibal would be easy to defeat, so they sent consul Publius Scipio to fight Hannibal. Scipio lost a cavalry engagement at the Battle of Ticinus and was fatally wounded. The Romans who had planned to send consul Sempronius Longus to invade Carthage recalled him to fight Hannibal. The armies met at Trebia after Longus was lured into battle which his army lost. The Gauls who lived in Northern Italy quickly switched to Hannibal's side after these two defeats, giving him more men then he started the campaign with. The losses were heavy, as at Trebia alone Rome lost almost 30,000 soldiers == Carthaginian Dominance == === Roman defeats === After the defeat at Trebia, the Romans re-voted for their consuls. The winners were Gaius Flaminius and Publius Furius Philus. Flaminius set out to met Hannibal who lured him into another trap at Lake Trasimene. Flaminius along with 15,000 Romans were killed in the fight. A relief army had been sent by Philus, but they were too late and were killed at The Battle of Umbrian Lake. === Enter: Fabius Maximus === Fabius Maximus became Dictator of Rome. His strategy known as the \"Fabian Strategy\" was to slowly weaken the enemy by avoiding battles. Eventually, his strategy fell out with the Romans. The army saw that if their job was to fight, they should've been doing that. The Senate and people were angry because their lands in Italy were now being ravaged by Hannibal who had moved into the richer areas of the republic. Two new consuls were elected in 216 BC. They were Gaius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, both of whom thought about their next plan of action differently. Varro wanted to attack the Carthaginians in a large battle, while Paullus seemed to be in favor with the Fabian Strategy. === Cannae === The Roman Senate decided to gather the largest army Rome ever gathered at that point, which were some 80,000 men. Paullus and Varro marched to Hannibal's position at Cannae, and the two prepared for the devastating battle. Hannibal placed his Spanish and Gallic troops in the center while having his stronger Carthaginians and Libyans at the sides. The Romans pushed his center back, and his flanks attacked the Roman sides. To make the disaster worse, Hannibal's Numidian cavalry had came back and hit the Romans from behind after defeating the Roman horsemen. Varro fled with the Roman cavalry. Paullus and the remaining men were trapped and were slaughtered by Hannibal's army. Around 70,000 Romans died, including almost 80 senators and Paullus. The devastating battle made Rome's southern allies switch sides. === The Aftermath of Cannae === After Cannae, even more Celts, Gauls, and Rome's southern allies switched to Hannibal. The Romans were stressed over the defeat. An army led by Lucius Postumius Albinus was then ambushed by the Boii Celts, and their leader was killed. This defeat was another problem Rome had to deal with. Then, Fabius Maximus became the dictator again. The Romans drafted criminals, slaves, and under-aged teenagers into the army. However, the King of Macedonia, Philip V of Macedonia pledged his allegiance to Hannibal. A rebellion also broke out in Sardinia, and Sicily also switched sides. == Romans come back == === Roman Victories === The Romans put down the revolt in Sardinia and began a siege of Syracuse, the capital of Sicily. However, Syracuse had one advantage, that being they were helped by Archimedes, the scientist. When the Romans entered, they tried to capture Archimedes, but he was stabbed to death by a Roman soldier. However, they did take Sicily. Then came the mess that was Southern Italy. The Southern cities switched sides often, and whenever one side took a city, the other could take it in a matter of days, as neither cared about defending too much. One notable Roman victory was the Siege of Capua. === Enter: Publius Cornelius Scipio === Publius Scipio had already healed from his wounds, so he went to invade Spain with his brother, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio. The two were eventually defeated and killed. However, the son of Publius Scipio, Publius Cornelius Scipio invaded Spain instead. Spain was mainly defended by Mago Barca, Hasdrubal Barca (both of which were brothers of Hannibal), and a man named Hannibal Gisco. Scipio went to the main stronghold, New Carthage, and took the city within a day. Mago fled back to Carthage while Hasdrubal tried to make it to Hannibal. He would be stopped in Italy and killed in the Battle of Metaurus. With Spain taken, Scipio made a visit to the Numidian kings, Masinissa and Syphax. Massinissa sided with the Carthaginians, so Scipio sided with Syphax. Once Hannibal received word of Scipio in Africa, he rushed back to Carthage. === The Final Battle === The two armies met at Zama, where the battle began. Hannibal had 3 lines of soldiers. Scipio sent his soldiers through, and even though they annihilated the first two, they still had the third one to deal with. The final one was Hannibal's best troops, and Scipio's cavalry had been chasing after that of the Carthaginians. Eventually, the Roman horses turned around and flanked the Carthaginians. Hannibal escaped to Carthage and convinced the Carthaginian government to surrender to Rome. == Ending == === The Roman Republic === The Romans quickly took back all lost territories and took parts of Carthage. They also declared Carthage couldn't declare war without their permission. Scipio returned in glory and became Scipio Africanus. He was involved in politics before his enemies made him quit and retire to a villa. The Roman Republic however let the treachery of their Southern Allies or the Macedonian king siding with Carthage go unnoticed. These would later prompt the Social War and Macedonian Wars. === The Carthaginian Empire === Carthage was reduced to nothing but a small city state under Rome's authority. Hannibal Barca stayed in politics before his enemies and the Romans looking to capture him made him flee to Tyre, Ephesus, and then Bithynia before dying. However, the two met somewhere along the way and became good friends. Scipio asked Hannibal who the greatest generals of all time were. Hannibal placed Alexander the Great at first, Pyrrhus of Epirus at second, and himself at third. Scipio burst out laughing and asked Hannibal \"And what if you had vanquished me?\", and Hannibal replied \"Then I would've been the greatest general of them all\". Hannibal would eventually commit suicide after hearing the Romans were still looking to capture him. == Significance == The war would eventually set the stage for the Third Punic War. The Romans would also invade Southern Italy and Macedonia, and taking more territory, creating the Roman Empire. It would also make the two generals legendary. Category:Wars",
