According to the Uruguayan constitution, they have the mission of fulfilling the requirements of National Defense, in order to safeguard the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the country, as well as to take care of strategic resources and contribute to the maintenance of internal peace. These three branches are constitutionally subordinate to the President of Uruguay, who exercises supreme command through the Minister of National Defense. The operational command of the forces falls to the Chief of the Defense Staff. As of 2003, Uruguay has more than 3,000 Uruguayan soldiers in twelve United Nations peacekeeping missions.
