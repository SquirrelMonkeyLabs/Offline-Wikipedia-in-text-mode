 "text": "Curb Records is a record label started by Mike Curb in 1973, after leaving MGM Records. Curb Records' first national success was the release (through Warner Bros. Records) of The Four Seasons comeback album, Who Loves You, and the singles that came from it in late 1975 and early 1976. Curb's roster includes several country music artists, including Tim McGraw, LeAnn Rimes, and Hank Williams Jr.. In late 2002, Curb Records also acquired a stake in Word Records from then-owners Time Warner. Curb still has a stake in Word even though Time Warner's stake was sold to the newly formed spin-off Warner Music Group in 2004. 2006 GMA Music Award Female Vocalist of the Year Natalie Grant signed with Curb Records. Former American Idol Kimberley Locke is also a member of the Curb roster. In 2006, Curb launched a sister imprint, Bruc Records, whose name is an acronym for \"Blues, Rock, Urban, Country\" (the name is also \"Curb\" spelled backwards). Hank III's third studio release, Straight to Hell, was the first album to be released on the new label. Curb Records supports charitable programs through the Mike Curb Family Foundation. Some of the supported programs include; the Mike Curb Family Welcome Centre at Second Harvest, Curb Youth Symphony, Curb Young Musicians Competition, Curb Concerto Competition, Curb Family Music Education Centre at the Nashville Symphony, and the Nashville Alliance For Public Education. ==Curb Records in the UK== In the UK, Curb artists (apart from those sub-licenced to the majors) are eligible for UK \"independent\" charts, as the label is called Proper Distribution. In January 2006, Curb scored a top ten hit with Brian Kennedy and Peter Corry's Tribute to George Best, an EP featuring recordings of \"You Raise Me Up\" amongst others. ==References== Category:Independent record labels Category:1973 establishments in the United States",
