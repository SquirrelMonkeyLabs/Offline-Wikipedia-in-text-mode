 "text": "The Băneasa Forest is a forest in the north of Bucharest, Romania. It is close to Băneasa neighborhood and Băneasa Airport. On its southern edge, it has a zoological garden, known as Zoo Băneasa. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the end of Romania's communist era, a large part of the area was transformed back from state property to private individuals, who had obtained judicial recognition of their family's titles. According to a 2007 estimate in the national newspaper Jurnalul, some 10,000 hectares had been reallocated through this process. == References == Category:Forests of Europe Category:Geography of Bucharest",
