The scarlet red skies attract the eye that never tires of discovering on small canvases overlaps of baroque architecture, spirals and twisted columns, sharp geometric surfaces or sweet curves, hatched with the skilful hand of the engineer-artist. == Bibliography == * Nicol√≤ D'Alessandro, Situazioni della pittura in Sicilia, 1940-1970, 1975 == Related pages == * Mario Bardi ==References== ==Other websites== * * Mario Bardi, Paesaggio Siciliano, 1970, Museo di Bagheria, Palermo Category:20th-century paintings Category:Paintings in Palermo Category:Paintings by Mario Bardi Category:1970s in art",
