 "text": "Star Fox 2 is a video game that was developed by Nintendo and Argonaut Software. It was completed in 1995 but was not released until 2017 on the Super NES Classic Edition. The game was originally going to be released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was going to be the second game in the Star Fox series and the sequel to Star Fox. It was going to be released in the summer of 1995. The game was cancelled because the Nintendo 64 was going to be released the following year. After it was cancelled, unfinished versions of the game was found and put on the internet. In 2017, the game was finally released for the Super NES Classic Edition. ==Gameplay== The gameplay of Star Fox is very different from the first Star Fox game. Instead of going on a path with the same missions each time, the player moves freely on a map screen of the Lylat system. When the player's ships hit an enemy, the screen switches to an action screen with gameplay like the first Star Fox game. Once the player completes what they have to do, they are taken back to the map screen to go to another area. The player's goal is to destroy all of the enemies on the map while defending Corneria (seen in the lower left corner of the map). The player has to stop Corneria's damage level from reaching 100% from enemy attacks. ==References== Category:2017 video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Star Fox Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about animals Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Video games developed in Japan",
