 "text": "Aşgabat (; , UniPers: Ešq-âbâd; - Ashkhabád) is the capital city of Turkmenistan. It also spelled as Ashgabat, Ashkabat, Ashkhabad, Ashgabad. Aşgabat has a population of 695,300 (2001) and is between the Karakum desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range. The name is believed to borrow from the Persian Ashk-abad meaning \"the City of Arsaces\". Another explanation is that the name is a corruption of the Persian Eshq (Love) + abad (natured place or city), and therefore loosely translates as \"The city built by/from love\". Aşgabat is at 37°58′N 58°20′E (37.9667, 58.333). Aşgabat's major ethnic groups are: Turkmen, Russians, Armenians, and Azeris. Arsaces was king of Persia and his name appears between 3 and 4 times in the Bible. ==More images== Image:Aschgabat01.JPG Image:Aschgabat02.JPG Image:Aschgabat03.JPG Image:07 Асхабад.
