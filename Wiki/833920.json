 "text": "Yaoshang (originally, \"Yaawol Shang\") is a spring festival celebrated by the Meitei ethnicity for five consecutive days starting from the full moon day of the lunar month of \"Lamta\" of the Meitei calendar (Manipuri calendar). Historically, it was a religious festival but in present days, it has lost its religious tones during celebration. It is the most important and the most popular festival in Manipur as well as among the Meitei ethnicity. Imitating the ways of Holi, people use colors to smear or spray among each other during the celebration.http://manipur.gov.in/wp- content/uploads/2013/02/general_holiday_2016.pdf ==References== Category:Meitei festivals",
