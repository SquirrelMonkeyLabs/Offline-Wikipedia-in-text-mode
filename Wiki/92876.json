He was the oldest son and the second child of King Charles II of France and Ermentrude of Orléans. He succeeded his father as king in October 877 and was crowned two days after his accession. Louis was physically weak. He couldn't speak very well. Unlike his father, he never became the Holy Roman Emperor. He had little interest in politics. He was a sweet and a simple man, a huge lover of peace, justice, and religion. His short two-year reign was very peaceful. In 879, Louis started a campaign against the Vikings who were donanating over Europe at that time. However, as soon as the campaign began, Louis felt ill and died on 10 April 879 at the age of 33. He was succeeded by his two sons, Louis III and Carloman II who both successfully defeated the Vikings together at the Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu in 881. Louis had achievements during his reign. He played a significant role in the ongoing struggles between the Carolingian dynasty and the Viking invaders, successfully defending the Frankish kingdom against Vikings. His dedication to securing the borders and maintaining peace within the realm earned him respect and admiration from his subjects and his people. ==References== Category:846 births Category:879 deaths Category:Frankish kings",
