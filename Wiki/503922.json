 "text": "Poltergeist is a 2015 American horror, fantasy and thriller movie. It is a remake of Steven Spielberg's 1982 movie with the same name. This new version is produced by Sam Raimi. It stars Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Jared Harris, and Jane Adams. The movie was released on May 22, 2015 in North America. It will be screened in 3D. ==Plot== This movie is about a family whose suburban home has an invasion of angry spirits. These frightening ghosts attack the family who live in a quiet wealthy neighborhood. They kidnap the youngest daughter. The family has to make a plan to rescue her. == Marketing == The first trailer for the new movie was released on February 5, 2015. A Slate Magazine writer said that the trailer made the movie look too much like the first one. James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly said that the trailer \"retains and amplifies several elements from the original\". He also gave praise that \"the modernizing doesn’t result in, say, the family’s daughter being kidnapped by ghosts in Snapchat\". Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting said that \"while every fiber of my being wants to reject it, [the film] actually looks pretty insane\", and praised the trailer's last scene. A Polygon writer said that the trailer looked similar to the first movie, but that it \"looks great, as a horror movie\". ==Reception== Poltergeist has not received good reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the movie got only a 34%, with 77 reviews. The audience rating was 34% who say they liked it. On Metacritic, the movie has a score of 47 out of 100, given by 25 critics. This means it has lower than average reviews. Roger Ebert said \"Nothing about 'Poltergeist' feels fresh or new\". He gave it one and a half stars. Ebert also said \"See it in 2D if you choose to see it at all.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2015 horror movies Category:2010s movie remakes Category:American horror movies Category:American movie remakes Category:Supernatural horror movies Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Haunted house movies Category:Movies directed by Gil Kenan",
