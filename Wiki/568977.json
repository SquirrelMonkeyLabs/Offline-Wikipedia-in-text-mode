The Mirage has a 20,000-gallon saltwater aquarium with over 450 species of fish. It has an indoor tropical rainforest housed in its tall atrium. In front of the Mirage is a volcano that erupts nightly depending on the season. Every hour there is a fire show. The huge balls of fire are choreographed to music and light up the lagoon next to it. The Mirage is connected by a free tram to Treasure Island, its sister property immediately to the north. == References == == Other websites == * Mirage website * Mirage Volcano Show in Las Vegas; YouTube Category:Hotels in Las Vegas Category:Casinos Category:Las Vegas Strip",
