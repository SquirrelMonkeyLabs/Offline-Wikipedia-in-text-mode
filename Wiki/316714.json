On November 11, 2016, it passed 36,000 articles. ==Policies== Rules in Chuvash Wikipedia are not as flexible in disputes as they are on English Wikipedia. Many things can be resolved through an arbitration committee. An arbitration committee can help with disagreements about things in articles, block users or stop certain users from editing articles on certain topics. Misuse of an administrator's privileges can also be easily appealed. The Chuvash Wikipedia accepts fair use content. Many things are allowed. One thing that is not allowed is categorizing or listing people based on their ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Such categories are usually not allowed unless the category is relevant to the main activity of a person. ==History== The Chuvash Wikipedia was created on November 22, 2004. ===Timeline=== * On December 16, 2004, the main page was created. * On March 9, 2006, the 2,000th article was created. * On August 22, 2006, the 4,000thЧувашская Википедия перешла рубеж в 4000 статей article was created. * On November 22, 2006, the 4,500th article was created. * In January 2007, the 5,000th article was created. * In September 2007, the 6,000th article was created. * On January 14, 2008, the 7,000th article was created. * On July 17, 2008, the 8,000th article was created. * On April 6, 2009, the 10,000thВ чувашском разделе Википедии количество статей перешло 10 000 рубеж article was created. * On February 13, 2010, the 11,000th article was created. * On October 4, 2010, the 11,451st article was created. * On August 31, 2011, the 13,000th article was created. * On November 11, 2016, the 36,000th article was created. ==Content== *Source: Нумай каçăллă категорисем ==Related pages== * ChuvashTet ==References== Category:Wikipedias Category:Websites established in 2004",
