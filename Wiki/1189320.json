 "text": "The list of solar system objects by mass. I will show you the planets and dwarf planets in a list of mass. 1 sun 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg. That’s about 333,000 times the mass of Earth—which makes sense, considering it contains more than 99% of the total mass of the entire solar system. 2 Jupiter 1.90 × 10²⁷ kg 3 Saturn 5.68 × 10²⁶ kg 4 Neptune 1.02 × 10²⁶ kg 5 Uranus 8.68 × 10²⁵ kg 6 Earth 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg 7 Venus 4.87 × 10²⁴ kg 8 Mars 6.42 × 10²³ kg 9 Mercury 3.30 × 10²³ kg That was the planets. Now to the dwarf planets. * Eris (~1.67 × 10²² kg) * Pluto (~1.31 × 10²² kg) * Haumea (~4.01 × 10²¹ kg) * Makemake (~3.10 × 10²¹ kg) * Gonggong (~1.75 × 10²¹ kg) * Sedna (~8 × 10²¹ kg) * Quaoar (~1.40 × 10²¹ kg) * Orcus (~6.35 × 10²¹ kg) * Ceres (~9.38 × 10²⁰ kg)",
