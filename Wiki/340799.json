 "text": "Kwikset is an American lock and door hardware manufacturer. Kwikset makes low to medium security residential and light commercial door locks. The Kwikset KW1 keyway is used by many other lock manufacturers. Kwikset recently introduced the SmartKey lock, which allows instant rekeying without removing the lock from the door, and without removing or replacing the core. The SmartKey lock uses the same KW1 key used in other Kwikset locks. The SmartKey lock is more difficult to pick than the standard Kwikset lock, although it is easier to force open.
