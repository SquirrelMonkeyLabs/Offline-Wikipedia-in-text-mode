 "text": "Pamela Weston (born London, 17 October 1921; died 9 September 2009, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland) was a British clarinettist, teacher and writer. She inspired many musicians through her inspiring teaching and her books about clarinettists and clarinet playing. Pamela Weston was born in London. Her father was a doctor. She went to Priors Field School, then went to the Royal Academy of Music and then got a scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music. She studied privately with Frederick Thurston, the principal clarinettist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. She became Professor of Clarinet at the Guildhall in 1951, and stayed there until 1969. She played in many concerts: sometimes as a soloist with orchestras, sometimes giving recitals or playing in chamber music. She was a member of the Klarion Trio (soprano, clarinet and piano) with whom she often played newly composed music including the \"Songs of Innocence\" which was written for them in 1957 by Arnold Cooke. She wrote several books about famous clarinet players of the past. She also wrote \"The Clarinet Teacher's Companion\", a book which was used by many clarinet teachers. During her last years she had a serious illness called encephalomyelitis. She did not want to suffer any more, so she travelled to Switzerland where she was allowed to have an assisted suicide. ==Reference== *Pamela Weston - Obituary; The Independent 23 October 2009, p. 47\\. *Pamela Weston - Obituary; The Guardian 08 October 2009. https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/08/pamela-weston-obituary Category:1921 births Category:2009 deaths Category:British teachers Category:British clarinetists Category:Deaths by euthanasia Category:Drug- related suicides Category:Musicians from London Category:Musicians who committed suicide",
