 "text": "Vanilla is a common flavor in ice cream, especially in North America and other countries. Vanilla ice cream was originally made by cooling a mixture of cream, sugar, and vanilla above a container of ice and salt. The type of vanilla used to give the flavour to the ice cream depends by places. In North America and parts of Europe, people are interested in a more smoky flavor, while in Ireland, an anise flavor is used. To create the smooth texture of ice cream, the mixture is stirred many times and then goes back to the container of ice and salt to continue the process. Many people often consider vanilla to be the normal flavor of ice cream. ==Related pages== *Chocolate ice cream Category:Ice cream",
