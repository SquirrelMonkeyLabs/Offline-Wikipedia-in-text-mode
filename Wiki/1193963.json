 "text": "The Meshwesh (often abbreviated in ancient Egyptian as Ma) was an ancient Libyan tribe, of Berber origin along with other groups like Libu and Tehenu/Tjemehu, and also some of the Sea Peoples. == Etymology == General Faidherbe established an etymological and ethnological connection between this \"Machauouasch people,\" in their Greek name of \"Macae,\" \"Mazici,\" and the Amazighs. However, this connection remains uncertain. == History == Meshwesh is known from ancient Egyptian texts as early as the 18th Dynasty under Amenhotep III, where it is mentioned as a source of livestock supplied to the palace of Malkata.Ancient Egyptian Online, Malkata (Malqata) PalaceJ. Desmond Clark: The Cambridge History of Africa, 1982, page 919, This indicates that there had been at least some trade relations between Meshwesh and the Egyptians. The later 18th Dynasty references to Meshwesh are generally sketchy. There are, however, references to Libyans (perhaps Meshwesh) mainly from the reign of Akhenaten, including a notable papyrus text that describes a group of Libyans killing an Egyptian. However, the papyrus is fragmentary, so the historical context is unknown. The Meshwesh were nomadic people who kept goats, camels, and other livestock, as well as hunted. Milk, meat, hides, and wool were collected from the domesticated animals for food, tents, and clothing. The earliest ancient Egyptian sources describe Meshwesh men with tattoos and long hair with bows made of long threads at the sides. Centuries later they are depicted with shorter hair, apparently influenced by Egypt, but the hair was braided and decorated with beads and one or two feathers, which were fastened on leather straps in a crown-like manner around the head. They still wore the same clothing as before, a thin antelope skin, dyed and printed, that crossed one shoulder and fell all the way to the calf. Women wore the same clothing as men, with braided, decorated hair, and both sexes wore abundant jewelry.The Temehu Tribes of Ancient Libya Later images show them adopting and adapting some of the Greek and Macedonian tunics. Weapons included bows and arrows, axes, spears, and daggers. Relations between the Libyans and Egyptians during the 20th Dynasty tended to be one of constant conflict. The Karnak battle reliefs of Seti I depict the king in battle with the Libyans.The Roles and Contributions of Seti I However, the text only mentions Tjehenu, which is thought to have referred to the area of ​​present- day Libya in ancient Egyptian. Under subsequent rulers, Ramses II had Egyptian forts built along the coast west of the Marsa Matruh area, including El Alamein and Zawyat Umm El Rakham.Gregory P. Gilbert: Ancient Egyptian Sea Power and the Origin of Maritime Forces, page 53 The presence of these forts posed a serious threat to the west, and Ramses claims to have defeated the Libyans in various texts. However, as was the case under Seti I, he does not specify whether Meshwesh was involved in the battle or not. During Merenptah's reign, it appears that the forts built by his father fell into disrepair, as in his 5th year the Libyans unexpectedly invaded the Nile Delta and the western oasis. Gerard Gertoux: The Pharaoh of the Exodus: Fairy tale or real history?, 2003, pp. 214, 215 Unlike his predecessors, Merenptah in his Karnak reliefs more specifically states that the invaders were mainly from the Libu tribe, but that Meshwesh was also involved. Merenptah claims that \"9,100 swords of Meshwesh\" were captured. (This struggle is also described on the Merenptah Stele. Twenty years later, during the reign of Ramesses III, the conflict between the Egyptians and the Libyans escalated. This time it was the Meshwesh who initiated the conflict, although other Libyan tribes and their Sea Peoples allies were involved in the battles during the 5th and 11th regnal years of Pharaoh Ramesses III (.Ramesses III, Egypt's Last, Great Pharaoh In the latter case, the campaign was fought almost exclusively with the Meshwesh. Ramseses claimed victory and placed the Meswesh in a prison camp to force them to adopt Egyptian culture and press them into military service in Ramses' army.[https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt/The-Middle- Kingdom-1938-c-1630-bce-and-the-Second-Intermediate-period-c-1630-1540-bce Encylopedia Britannica, The early 20th dynasty: Setnakht and Ramseses III ==References== ==Sources== *Bates, Oric. 1914.
