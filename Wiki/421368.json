Moore is known for replacing Mike Karakas in the Chicago Black Hawks net in game one of the 1938 Stanley Cup Finals because replacement goaltender Paul Goodman did not arrive in Toronto on time. He spent the end of his career in the AHL, playing for the Cleveland Barons, New Haven Eagles, Springfield Indians, Buffalo Bisons and Philadelphia Rockets. In 1941, Moore retired from playing professional ice hockey. In 1949, he became the head coach of the Galt Black Hawks of the Ontario Hockey Association which he coached for 1 season.
