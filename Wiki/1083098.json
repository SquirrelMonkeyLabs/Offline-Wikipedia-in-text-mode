 "text": "The Hong Kong whipping frog, hourglass whipping frog, hour-glass marked tree frog, spot-legged tree frog, Haut Sanuk frog, yellow tree frog, northern tree frog, or big-headed tree frog (Polypedates megacephalus) is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, China, and Hong Kong. People have seen them between 80 and 2000 meters above sea level. This frog can live in many different types of places, for example farms and rice paddies. The female frog lays eggs in ponds or rice paddies. She lays them on grass or in a nest made out of mud. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it can live in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
