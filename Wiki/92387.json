 "text": "Barnim is a district in Brandenburg, Germany. == History == The district was made in 1993 by joining the old districts of Bernau and Eberswalde. The district is in the same place as the area of forest where noblemen started hunting in the 13th century, but is smaller than the old region. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms of the district is like the coat of arms of the former district Oberbarnim. The only difference is that the old one had a silver top half and a red bottom half, while the current one is split into four parts and in the right half exchanged red and silver. The eagle in the top half is the eagle of Brandenburg. == Towns and municipalities == Amt-free towns Ämter # Bernau bei Berlin # Eberswalde # Werneuchen Amt-free municipalities # Ahrensfelde # Panketal # Schorfheide # Wandlitz 1\\.
