 "text": "Carbon neutrality refers to the goal of getting to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions to prevent or reduce global warming. This can be done by balancing emissions of carbon dioxide with its removal (often through carbon offsetting) or by eliminating emissions from society (the transition to the \"post-carbon economy\"). It is used in the context of carbon dioxide-releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, agriculture, and industry. Some countries are carbon neutral: Comoros, Gabon, Guyana, Madagascar, and Niue. While Bhutan, Panama, and Suriname are carbon-negative countries. == Related pages == *Nuclear power *Renewable energy ==References== Category:Climate change",
