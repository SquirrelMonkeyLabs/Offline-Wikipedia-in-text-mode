 "text": "The spiny-knee leaf frog (Phrynomedusa fimbriata) is an extinct frog that lived in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Paranapiacaba. It was last seen in the early 20th century. People saw it about 1000 meters above sea level. Scientists believe that these frogs are dead because they have not seen any since the 1950s. They think the frog probably lived in trees and laid its eggs in streams, but they are not sure. Scientists think this frog died because of a few things: air pollution from factories in Cubat√£o and a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This is because the fungus can kill the frog Phrynomedusa dryade. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
