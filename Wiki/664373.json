Film critic Balaji commented that it was \"one of the few movies in recent times where a lot of importance seems to have been attached to the script. In spite of the flimsy story and routine screenplay where a youth grows to be a \"dada\", the dialogs elevate the quality of the movie and make it very enjoyable\". His second film Saamy, under the Kavithaalaya banner, starred Vikram. It was named the year's biggest hit, grossing 160 million.
