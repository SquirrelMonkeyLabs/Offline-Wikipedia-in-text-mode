 "text": "WordGirl is an American animated superhero children's television series. It was produced by the Soup2Nuts animation unit of Scholastic Entertainment for PBS Kids and PBS Kids Go!. WordGirl began as a series of short segments named The Amazing Colossal Adventures of WordGirl, which premiered on PBS Kids Go! on November 10, 2006. These segments were usually shown at the end of an episode of Maya & Miguel. WordGirl was later spun off into a series of thirty- minute episodes. It premiered on September 3, 2007 on most PBS member stations. The series of shorts had thirty episodes. The full half-hour series had 128 episodes (248 segments). WordGirl creator Dorothea Gillim felt that most children's animation \"underestimated [children's] sense of humor\" and hoped to create a show for young viewers that did not talk down to them. By June 2014, many PBS stations had stopped airing WordGirl, opting to air more popular series throughout the summer. However, new episodes continued to air on select stations, with streaming options on the PBS Kids website and video app. The series ended on August 7, 2015, with the episode \"Rhyme and Reason\".
