 "text": "Hurricane Lane was a 2018 Pacific hurricane. The storm threatened to hit the U.S. State of Hawaii. It was the first Category 5 hurricane since Hurricane Patricia in October 2015. On August 21, when Lane came close to the Hawaiian Islands, a hurricane watch was put up for Maui and Hawaii counties. Early the next day, the watch was changed to a hurricane warning. Lane dumped heavy rainfall on Hawaiian Islands, with rainfall accumulations of over 50 inches in Mountain View, resulting of becoming the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Hawaii. It is also ranked as the second wettest tropical cyclone in the United States after Hurricane Harvey in 2017. On August 29, Lane was dissipated near the International Date Line. ==References== Category:Hurricanes in the United States Category:2018 in Hawaii",
