It is an aerobic bacteria. It can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment. It forms spores. It is mesolphilic in nature. It grows best in moderate temperature, neither too hot nor too cold. It is an actinobacterium. It was isolated from a sample of limestone quarry in Hungpung region of Kangleipak (Manipur). == Morphology == Micromonospora kangleipakensis DSM 45612 is positive in gram stain. It has cell width of 0.87 µm.Barberan A, Caceres Velazquez H, Jones S, Fierer N.: Hiding in Plain Sight: Mining Bacterial Species Records for Phenotypic Trait Information. mSphere 2: 2017 (DOI 10.1128/mSphere.00237-17, PubMed 28776041) == Culture and growth conditions == === Culture medium === It was cultured in the medium of Gym Streptomyces Medium (DSMZ Medium 65).Leibniz Institut DSMZ- Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH ; Curators of the DSMZ; DSM 45612 === Temperature === It grows under different temperatures.

So, it has good tolerance for oxygen. It also has the good ability of spore formation. There are quinones of MK-10(H6), MK-10(H2) MK-11(H4), MK-10(H4) observed in it.Japan Collection of Microorganism (JCM) ; Curators of the JCM During the carbon source type of metabolite utilisation testing, metabolites like alanine, glutamate, leucine, mannose and serine are found. == References == == Bibliography == * IJSEM list: Oren A, Garrity GM.
