 "text": "A total lunar eclipse happened at the Moon's descending node of orbit on Friday, March 14, 2025, with an umbral magnitude of 1.1804. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow, causing the Moon to be black, red or orange. A total lunar eclipse happens when the Moon's near side entirely passes into the Earth's umbral shadow. Unlike a total solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a very small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be seen from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly two hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. It happened about 3.3 days before apogee (on March 17, 2025, at 12:35 UTC), the Moon's apparent diameter was slightly smaller. ==References== Category:Lunar eclipses Category:March 2025 events",
