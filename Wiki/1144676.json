The Kharayeb region had been inhabited since the Middle Paleolithic. Many flint tools from that perioud have been found. The earliest signs of agricultural use in historical periods comes from the site of Jemjim near Kharayeb. A stele from the Late Iron Age was discovered there. A settlement with a system of cisterns dating to the Iron Age, and remains of terracotta vessels indicating occupation dating back to the second millennium BC have also been found. During the Persian period (539–330 BC), Phoenicia flourished economically. The population in the cities on the coast grew. These populations needed to be sustained; this meant that resources needed to be used in better ways in their respective territories. The Persian policy aimed at promoting intensive agriculture within irrigated areas further supported this development. The subsistence of Tyre was ensured by the establishment of ancient rural agricultural centers, extending from the coast to southern Palestine. These rural areas, especially those situated near rivers, played a important role in Tyre's economy; a number of planned settlements were built. This is the context that allowed the town of Kharayeb to grow. The construction of its Phoenician temple was begun around the 6th century BC. The modern town of Kharayeb dates back to the mid-19th century when it and its surroundings were owned by Nasif Al-Asaad, a resident of Zrarieh. == Geography == Kharayeb is in the Sidon District of the South Governorate.
