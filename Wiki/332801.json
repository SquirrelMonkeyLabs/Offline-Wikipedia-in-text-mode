 "text": "Club de Foot Montréal, commonly known as CF Montréal, is a Canadian soccer team based in Montreal, Quebec. It has played in the Eastern Conference of Major League Soccer (MLS) since 2012. The club was created in 2010 as an expansion team named the Montreal Impact. It was the third Canadian team to join the MLS. The old Montreal Impact of the North American Soccer League (NASL) was replaced by this team. The team's motto is \"Tous Pour Gagner\". That is French for \"All for victory. The club plays its home games at the Saputo Stadium and is coached by Mauro Biello. == History == On March 10, 2012, the Impact played their first MLS game, which ended in a 2-0 loss against Vancouver Whitecaps. The Impact won the Canadian Championship in both 2013 and 2014. == Rivalries == Montreal Impact's biggest rival is Toronto F.C. because of Canada's two largest cities (Toronto and Montreal) having shared multiple rivalries. Montreal and Toronto professional soccer teams have competed against each other for over 40 years. From the original North American Soccer League, as well as the Canadian Soccer League and the A-League, the rivalry has continued through many different leagues they have played up until the past few years where both cities would still occasionally meet for the Canadian Championships. Since both teams have joined MLS, the rivalry is even more intense and the matches have become a Canadian soccer classic called the 401 Derby. ==Notes== == References == Category:1992 establishments in Canada Category:Canadian soccer teams Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:Sports teams in Montreal",
