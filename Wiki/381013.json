 "text": "Michael Stanley Dukakis (, born November 3, 1933) served as the 65th and 67th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991. He is the longest-serving Governor in Massachusetts and only the second Greek-American governor in United States history, after Spiro Agnew. In 1988, he was the Democratic nominee for President, but lost to Republican then–Vice President, George H. W. Bush. ==After the 1988 Election== Dukakis was mentioned as candidate for Massachusetts Senator for a possible interim successor to Ted Kennedy, after Kennedy's death but Governor Deval Patrick chose Paul G. Kirk, the other candidate and a favorite of the Kennedy Family. In 2008, he talked about his defeat in an interview with Katie Couric, in which he said he \"owe[d] the American people an apology\" because \"if I had beaten the old man, we never would have heard of the kid, and we wouldn't be in this mess.\" ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Commonwealth of Massachusetts Governors Biography * *Michael S.
