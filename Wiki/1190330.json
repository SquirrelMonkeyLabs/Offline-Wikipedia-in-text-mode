 "text": "Bent molecular geometry is a type of molecular geometry. An atom in a molecule has this geometry if it has chemical bonds to two other atoms, but the three atoms are not in a straight line. The normal reason for bent molecular geometry is one or two lone pairs on the central atom. These pairs repel each other and the atom-atom bonds. Depending on the number of lone pairs, bent molecular geometry is similar to trigonal planar molecular geometry or tetrahedral molecular geometry, but the angles are slightly different because of the different repulsion between the atom-atom bonds and the lone pairs.
