The Parthians were excellent horsemen and archers. In battle, mounted Parthians often discharged their arrows back towards the enemy and pretended to flee. In 250 BC, the Parthians succeeded in founding an independent kingdom, which in the 1st century BC grew into an empire extending from the Euphrates to the Indus and from the Amu Darya to the Indian Ocean. They expanded by successfully expelling the Seleucids from Persia and establishing the second great Persian Empire. *See Crassus for an account of their defeat of a Roman army. == Other websites == * Parthia.com - with an extensive bibliography * History of Parthia *The Establishment and Development of Christianity in the Parthian Empire in Transoxiana 6. *Parthia (Old Persian Parthava) Category:Ancient Rome Category:Ancient history by country Category:History of Iran Category:History of Pakistan Category:History of Persia Category:Ancient history of Azerbaijan Category:Former countries in Asia Category:Former countries in the Middle East Category:Former empires",
