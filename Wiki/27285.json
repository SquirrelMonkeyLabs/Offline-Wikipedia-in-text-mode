 "text": "Animal rights is a term used for the general belief that non-human animals deserve rights. Most people that support animal rights believe that humans should not use animals in food, clothing, experimentation, and entertainment. People that support animal rights also believe that just as you have human rights simply because you are a human, other animals deserve animal rights simply because they are an animal. Things like Animal Farm, by George Orwell, is an allegory, showing that animals have rights, and the political side of things too. ==Related pages== *Speciesism *Veganism *Vegetarianism *Animal cruelty *Animal Farm (novel) *Animal Rights Militia *Animal rights movement *Animal Rights (song) *Animal welfare ==Other websites== *Animal Rights Library Category:Political movements",
