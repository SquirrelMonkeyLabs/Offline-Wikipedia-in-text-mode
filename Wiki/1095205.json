 "text": "Mystery religions or mystery cults were religions or cults where the teachings were only known to a small group of people. These people were called mystai. Such groups were common in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Mystery religions have the following properties: * Exclusive spiritual experience: Those that are initiated gain speciual (secret) knowledge, and are the only ones that are able to make certain spiritual experiences * The cult or religion coexists with other (official) cults or religions for the same deity * Religious syncretism; there are other secret teachings that are added to the official teachings about the cult of a given deity. Today, analyzing these mystery religions is difficult, because most of them kept their mysteries. Common motives in such cults are a dying goddess that is resurrected and becomes immortal, venerating the ancestors, venerating the mother.
