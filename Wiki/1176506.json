 "text": "Corruption in Guinea-Bissau is very widespread. The country has one of the highest rates of corruption in the world. == Causes == Corruption in Guinea- Bissau has many causes. As of 2014, government mismanagement had \"created an environment conducive to corruption on a grand scale.\" This meant that conditions in the government made it easy to commit widespread corruption. Corruption is also difficult to expose and fight. The country's judicial system is slow, and citizens have no right to access information. These conditions help to keep corruption secret and make it difficult to defeat it. Another problem is that Guinea-Bissau is a hub of international drug trafficking. One source states: > Abject poverty, state collapse, lack of [wealth] and endemic corruption have > made Guinea Bissau a heaven for the Colombian drug lords. == Rankings == === Corruption Perceptions Index (2024) === ==== Giving a corruption score ==== In Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2024, Guinea-Bissau scored 21 on a scale from 0 (\"highly corrupt\") to 100 (\"very clean\").
