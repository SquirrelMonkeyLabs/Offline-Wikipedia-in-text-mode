 "text": "Brother Niceforo's poison arrow frog or Niceforo's poison frog (Ameerega ingeri) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. This frog lives in tropical forests on the eastern side of the Andes Mountains in Colombia. Scientists saw these frogs between 100 and 400 meters above sea level. Scientists found exactly one frog. They found it in 1970. Scientists went back to the frog's home later, but they did not see it again. Today, scientists are not sure if the scientists from 1970 were talking about this frog or a different one. The paper the scientists wrote about their 1970 frog said the frog was red in color. But the frogs that scientists found in the same place in 2016 were brown and blue in color. This does not mean they could not be the same species of frog. If they are all the same frog, then there are many of these frogs alive now. Scientists think this frog might live in one protected park: Parque Nacional Natural Alto Fragua Indiwasi. Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. But the place where they found the frog has had too many trees cut down so people could build places for cows to eat grass. There is no forest where the scientists first found the frog, but there is a protected park nearby. Scientists think surviving frogs might live inside the park now. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
