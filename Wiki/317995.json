 "text": "The 1938 New England Hurricane was an extremely damaging and highly deadly Atlantic tropical cyclone which struck Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont with strong winds of Category 4 hurricane level. The hurricane did not curve out to sea like hurricanes usually do. The 1938 storm caused over 300 million in property damage (1938 USD) and killed between 682 and 800 people. Tropical cyclones were not given human names at the time, so the 1938 storm had a number instead.
