The group's goals is to form a Islamic state based on Sharia law. The group was originally a part of the Syrian Islamic Front from 2013-2016 but later split due to the group becoming defunct. The group has alleged ties to Jabhat Al- Nusra and Al-Qaeda. The group pledged allegiance to Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham on the 8th of November 2021 but decided to remain a seperate group from Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham to prevent Ahrar al-Sham being designated a terrorist group. == Ideology == The group's ideology is based off of a mix of nationalism, Salafi jihadism, and secularism.
