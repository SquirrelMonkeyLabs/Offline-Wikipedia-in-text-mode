 "text": "Loy Krathong is a special day in some countries. In Thailand, the festival is called Loy Krathong or Loi Krathong. The day happens once every year. In the evening, part of what happens, is that crowds of people go to temples and beaches. (Note: temples often have a small pond or pool; those pools are not for swimming.) At beaches and temples, many individuals have (each) one hand- held float that has a candle that is lit. The float is placed into the water (at a beach or in the pond at the temples). The floats are then (let go or) released into the water. The day is a custom. == References == Category:Thailand Category:Days",
