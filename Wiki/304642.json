 "text": "The following is a List of numbered routes in Delaware, made up of Interstate highways, U.S. routes, and state routes. The Delaware Department of Transportation is responsible for taking care of the numbered roads in Delaware. State routes in Delaware use a highway sign that has the numbers in a white circle on a black square. Delaware's numbering system is like that of the U.S. Highways in that odd numbered highways (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) travel north-south and even numbered routes (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) go east-west. The numbers get bigger as one goes south and west respectively. There are some numbers that do not follow this, however, mostly with routes from other states keeping their number as they enter Delaware. __TOC__ ==History== The first numbered routes in Delaware came in 1925 with the creation of the U.S. Highway System, in which US 13, US 40, and US 113 were made by law to run through the state. In 1930 and again in 1932, the Delaware State Highway Department suggested giving numbers to state roads to go along with the existing U.S. Highway System. By 1936, Delaware began giving numbers to state routes. In 1956, the Interstate Highway System was made, with under 40 miles of Interstate highway made by law in New Castle County. ==State routes== ==U.S. routes in Delaware== Route Starting point Ending point Length (mi) Length (km) Notes Cape May-Lewes Ferry at Lewes at Maryland border at Delmar at Pennsylvania border near Claymont / at Delmar Number removed in 1950s Became US 13 in 1970s at Pennsylvania border near Claymont Number removed in 1967 at Maryland border near Glasgow at New Jersey border near Wilmington Manor at Maryland border at Selbyville Number removed in 2004 at Pennsylvania border in Brandywine Hundred Became US 202 in 1934 at Pennsylvania border in Brandywine Hundred at Maryland border near Warwick, MD Became US 301 in 1987 Number removed in 1987 Number removed in 2001 ==Interstate highways in Delaware== Route Starting point Ending point Length (mi) Length (km) Notes at Maryland border near Newark at Pennsylvania border near Claymont at New Jersey border near Wilmington Manor Became I-95 in 1982 ==References== ==Other websites== * AARoads Delaware Highways Page Category:Roads in Delaware Category:Delaware-related lists Category:Lists of roads in the United States",
