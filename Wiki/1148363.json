 "text": "Dark fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy literature that incorporates elements of horror and gothic fiction. It blends magical and supernatural elements with darker, often sinister themes. The atmosphere of dark fantasy typically includes a sense of foreboding, morally ambiguous characters, and settings that emphasize a bleak or ominous tone. This genre often explores themes of despair, corruption, and moral conflict, delving into the darker sides of humanity and the supernatural. == Origins and Development == The roots of dark fantasy can be traced back to the gothic novels of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Bram Stoker's Dracula. These combined supernatural elements with a darker, psychologically intense tone. In the early 20th century, writers such as H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard began incorporating these elements into fantasy fiction, giving rise to a genre that was distinctly darker and more introspective. The term \"dark fantasy\" became popular in the mid-20th century to describe works that combined elements of horror with the fantastical. Notable early contributors include Clark Ashton Smith and Fritz Leiber. By the late 20th century, dark fantasy had become a prominent genre, with writers like Stephen King (The Dark Tower), Michael Moorcock (Elric of Melniboné), and George R.R. Martin (A Song of Ice and Fire) shaping its conventions. == Influence == Dark fantasy's influence extends to visual media as well, with films like Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro and video games like Dark Souls embracing dark fantasy aesthetics and themes. The genre continues to evolve, blending elements from other subgenres and expanding its reach to audiences around the world. == Related pages == * Gothic fiction * Horror fiction * High fantasy == Other websites == * British Library – Gothic literature * Goodreads – Dark Fantasy Category:Literature Category:Fantasy",
