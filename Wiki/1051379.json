It happened from Monday, December 15, 1788, to Saturday, January 10, 1789, under the new Constitution made official that same year. George Washington was elected with no opposition. This would be the first of two times he was elected, as he would serve two terms as president. John Adams became the first vice president. This was the only U.S. presidential election that took more than one calendar year (not counting ones that had a follow-up election). It was also the first national presidential election in America. Under the Articles of Confederation, which were created in 1781, the United States had no head of state. The executive function of government remained with the legislative similar to countries that use a parliamentary system. Federal power, which wasn't as powerful, was only managed by the Congress of the Confederation whose \"President of the United States in Congress Assembled\" was also chair of the Committee of the States which existed to do a job similar to that of the modern Cabinet. The Constitution created the offices of President and Vice President, and separated their jobs from Congress. The Constitution made an Electoral College, based on each state's number of Congressmen, where each elector would make two votes for two candidates, a process changed in 1804 by the passing of the Twelfth Amendment. States had different ways for choosing presidential electors.See \"Alternative methods for choosing electors\" under Electoral College. In five states, the state government chose electors. The other six chose electors through, in some way, having the people vote. However, only two states had the population vote directly. Washington, who was really popular, was well known as the past Commander of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. After he agreed to come out of retirement, he was easily elected by everyone. Because the vice president used to also be elected through the electoral college, Washington didn't choose one. No political parties existed. However, most people called themselves Federalists or Anti- Federalists. Because of this, the contest for the Vice-President was anyone's game. Thomas Jefferson predicted that a popular leader from the North like John Hancock from Massachusetts or John Adams, a past American representative to Great Britain who had represented Massachusetts in Congress, would be elected vice president. Anti-Federalist leaders such as Patrick Henry, who didn't run, and George Clinton, who didn't like the Constitution, were also choices. The entire electoral college, which had 69 people, made one vote for Washington, making his election an unopposed win. Adams won 34 votes and became vice president. The other 35 votes went to ten different people, like John Jay, who finished third with nine. Three states couldn't be in the election: New York's state government chose their electors too late and North Carolina and Rhode Island had not recognized the constitution yet. Washington was inaugurated in New York City on April 30, 1789, 57 days after the First Congress first met. ==Candidates== Even though no political parties existed yet, people's opinions were a bit divided between those who had liked ratification (creation) of the Constitution, called Federalists also known as Cosmopolitans, and Anti-Federalists or Localists who either weren't sure about ratification or didn't like it at all. However, everyone supported Washington for President. Some campaining happened in divided places. For example, in Maryland, a state that let people vote, unofficial parties campaigned. ===Federalist candidates=== File:Official Presidential portrait of John Adams (by John Trumbull, circa 1792).jpg| File:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg| File:John Rutledge, by James Herring after John Trumbull.jpg| File:JohnHancockSmall.jpg| File:Samuel Huntington - Charles Willson Peale.jpg| File:General Benjamin Lincoln-restored.jpg| ===Anti-Federalist candidates=== File:George Clinton by Ezra Ames.jpg| ==General election== Since no political parties existed, no process to decide Federalist and Anti-Federalist candidates existed at the time, and that caused most to expect Washington to win easily. For example, Alexander Hamilton agreed with the public's opinion when he wrote a letter to Washington attempting to persuade him to leave retirement on his farm in Mount Vernon to serve as President. He wrote that \"...the point of light in which you stand at home and abroad will make an infinite difference in the respectability in which the government will begin its operations in the alternative of your being or not being the head of state.\" Another thing people weren't sure of was who would be the candidate for the vice presidency, which didn't have a real description except being next in line to the presidency and watching over the Senate. The Constitution said that the job would be given to the second place person in the Presidential election. Since Washington was from Virginia, the largest state, many thought electors would choose a vice president from a different state, likely in the north. In a letter written in August 1788 , U.S. Minister to France Thomas Jefferson wrote that he thought John Adams and John Hancock, both from Massachusetts, would be the top people for vice president. Jefferson recommended John Jay, John Rutledge, and a candidate from Virginia, James Madison, as other possible winners.Meacham 2012. Adams received 34 votes, one short of a majority (over half). Since the Constitution didn't require a majority in the Electoral College before the creation of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804, Adams was elected. The popular vote count was a low single-digit percentage of the adult population. Even though all states allowed some form of popular vote, only six states allowed any form of popular vote for presidential electors. In most states only white men, and in many only those who owned property, could vote. Free black men could vote in four Northern states, and women could vote in New Jersey until 1776. In some states, there was a religious test for voting. For example, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the Congregational Church was made, supported by taxes. Voting was delayed a lot by bad communications and the heavy amount of work by farming. Two months passed after the election before the votes were counted and Washington was told he had been elected president. Washington took eight days to travel from Virginia to New York for the inauguration. Congress took twenty-eight days to assemble. As the electors were selected, politics got in the way, and the process had many rumors and speculation. For example, Hamilton tried to ensure that Adams did not accidentally tie Washington in the electoral vote.Chernow, 272–273. Also, Federalists spread rumors that Anti- Federalists wanted to elect Richard Henry Lee or Patrick Henry president, with George Clinton as vice president. However, Clinton received only three votes. ==Results== ===Popular vote=== Popular vote Popular vote Count Percentage Federalist electors 39,624 90.5% Anti-Federalist electors 4,158 9.5% Total 43,782 100.0% Source: United States Presidential Elections, 1788-1860: The Official Results by Michael J. Dubin Only six of the 11 states that were able to cast electoral votes chose electors by any type of popular vote. Less than 1.8% of the population voted: the 1790 Census would count a total population of 3.0 million with a free population of 2.4 million and 600,000 slaves in those states making electoral votes. States that did choose electors by popular vote had different restrictions on voting depending on rpoperty requirements. ===Electoral vote=== Source: Source (popular vote): A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787–1825 Only 6 of the 10 states making electoral votes chose electors by any type of popular vote. Less than 1.8% of the population voted: the 1790 Census would count a total population of 3.0 million with a free population of 2.4 million and 600,000 slaves in those states making electoral votes. States that did choose electors by popular vote had different restrictions on suffrage depending property requirements. Because the New York government elected electors too late, there were no voting electors from New York. Two electors from Maryland didn't vote. One elector from Virginia didn't vote and another elector from Virginia was not chosen because an election region failed to submit forms. The identity of this person comes from The Documentary History of the First Federal Elections (Gordon DenBoer (ed.), University of Wisconsin Press, 1984, p. 441). Several respected sources, including the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress and the Political Graveyard, instead show this person to be James Armstrong of Pennsylvania. However, primary sources, such as the Senate Journal, list only Armstrong's name, not his state. People who question it say that Armstrong received his single vote from an elector from Georgia. They find this impossible because Armstrong was not nationally known, as his public service to that date made up of being a medical officer during the American Revolution and, at most, one year as a Pennsylvania judge. ===Results by state=== ====Popular vote==== The popular vote totals used are the elector from each party with the highest votes. The vote totals of Virginia are apparently incomplete.

As the Constitution before 1804 says, each elector was allowed to make two votes for president, with a majority of \"the whole number of electors appointed\" (the total amount of voters) needed to elect a president. Out of the 69 electors, everyone voted for Washington who became president. Of the other candidates, only Adams, Jay, and Hancock received votes from more than one state. With 34 votes, Adams finished second behind just Washington, and because of that he was elected vice president.

Federalists, backed by the great landed families and the city commercial interests, were the largest faction in the Senate, the smaller of the two groups. Roughly a quarter of the state's free white male population was allowed to vote, but in the House of Representatives, with its larger membership and voting power, Anti-federalists representing the middling interests held the majority. The fight to ratify the United States Constitution was still fresh in the memories of the lawmakers, and the Anti- Federalists were not happy as they had been forced by events to accept the constitution without changes. Bills to control the selection of electors were brought up in each house and rejected by the other, leading to a sticky situation. The situation continued on January 7, 1789, the last day for electors to be chosen by the states, causing New York to fail to appoint their eight electors. ==Electoral college selection== The Constitution, in Article II, Section 1, said that the state governments should decide how their Electors were chosen. Governments chose different methods: New York's legislature did not choose electors on time. One electoral district failed to choose an elector. ==Related pages== * 1788–89 United States House of Representatives elections * 1788–89 United States Senate elections * History of the United States (1789–1849) ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Bowling, Kenneth R., and Donald R.
