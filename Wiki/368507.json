 "text": "The Reluctant Dragon is a 1941 American combined live action and animated movie. It was produced by Walt Disney. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures on June 27, 1941. The movie gives a tour of the then-new Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The movie stars radio comedian Robert Benchley and many Disney staffers such as Ward Kimball, Fred Moore, Norman Ferguson, Clarence Nash and Walt Disney, all as themselves. The first third of the movie is in black-and-white. The last two-thirds are in Technicolor. Most of the movie is live-action. There are four short animated parts. There is a black- and-white part with Casey Junior from Dumbo in his first appearance. There are three Technicolor cartoons: Baby Weems, Goofy's How to Ride a Horse, and The Reluctant Dragon. The Reluctant Dragon is based on Kenneth Grahame's book of the same name. Notably, The Reluctant Dragon was Disney's first attempt at focusing on live action characters, being Disney's first live action movie. As such, it was the first Disney movie to not be in part of the Disney Canon. Other than Casey Junior, the Disney characters introduced are Bambi as a painted cel and Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Captain Hook, Mr. Smee, John Darling, Michael Darling, Aunt Sarah and Si and Am as statues. The characters would later appear in their respective future Disney animated movies. ==Other websites== * Category:1941 movies Category:1940s family movies Category:1940s fantasy movies Category:Disney animated movies Category:American fantasy- comedy movies Category:Movies directed by Alfred L.
