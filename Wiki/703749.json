The detention center was being used as a holding facility for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe when a storage hangar that it used as a residential facility was destroyed in an aerial bombing. The United Nations Human Rights Council stated that \"It was known that there were 600 people living inside\" the facility. At least 53 people were killed and 130 were wounded. ==References== Category:2010s in Libya Category:2019 in Africa Category:July 2019 events",
