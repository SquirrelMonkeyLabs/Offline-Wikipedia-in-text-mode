Long subjugated, long scorned by all, But, from today, breaking tyranny's hold. Through work, order and dignity You reconquer your rights, your unity, And to take this new step The voice of our ancestors call us. To work! In order and dignity, In the respect for rights and in unity, Breaking poverty and tyranny, Holding high the standard of the Fatherland. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Central African Republic",
