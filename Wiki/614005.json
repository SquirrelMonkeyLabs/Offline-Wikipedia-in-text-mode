 "text": "Hurricane Julia was the easternmost Category 4 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic basin since reliable satellite observations became available. On Sept. 15, Julia and Igor had both been powerful category four hurricanes but Julia's wind speeds had continued to drop since because of wind shear from monster hurricane Igor's outflow. By 11 a.m. EDT on Sept. 20, the National Hurricane Center issued their final warning on Julia. She was 1,100 miles west of the Azores near 34.7 North and 46.4 West and maximum sustained winds were near 46 mph, but quickly weakening. Julia had later been downgraded into a low pressure system and is now in the 2010 Atlantic Hurricane Season history books. Meanwhile, Igor's life history is not finished as he makes a track further into the North Atlantic Ocean. Hurricane Julia became a Category 4 storm in just 24 hours. She is currently out in the Atlantic with sustained winds at 135 mph. Luckily, there were no deaths. The maximum wind speed of the cyclone was 140mph. The minimum pressure created was 948/949mb. The cyclone lasted for 13 days (09/12 - 09/24) with the changing of the catergories. Category:Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes Category:2010 Atlantic hurricane season",
