 "text": "The Cape Colony () was the name of a colony based around the Cape of Good Hope, in southern Africa. It was first established in 1652 by Jan van Riebeeck as a governorate of the Dutch East India Company. It was captured by the British in 1795 and returned to the Dutch in 1802. In 1806 it was again captured by the British. It united with three other British colonies in 1910 to form the Union of South Africa when it was renamed the \"Cape Province\". Its capital was Cape Town, the modern-day legislative capital of the Republic of South Africa. ==Lists of Leaders== King/Queen King/Queen 1795–1820 George III 1820–1830 George IV 1830–1837 William IV 1837–1901 Queen Victoria 1901–1910 Edward VII 1910 George V GovernorsActing governors and lieutenant governors are not in this list GovernorsActing governors and lieutenant governors are not in this list 1797–1798 George Macartney 1799-1801 George Younge 1803-1806 Lieut-Gen Jan Willems JansenUnder Dutch Government 1807-1811 Earl of Caledon 1811-1814 Francis Cradock 1814-1826 Lord Charles Somerset 1828-1833 Galbraith Cole 1834-1838 Benjamin D'Urban 1834-1844 Thomas Napier 1847 Henry Pottinger 1847-1852 Henry Smith 1852-1854 George Cathcart 1854-1861 Sir George Grey 1862-1870 Philip Wodehouse 1870-1877 Henry Barkly 1877-1880 Bartle Frere 1881-1889 Hercules Robinson 1889-1895 Henry Loch 1895-1897 Hercules Robinson (Lord Rosemead) 1897-1901 Alfred Milner 1901–1910 Walter Hely-Hutchinson Notes Prime Ministers Prime Ministers 1872–1878 John Charles Molteno 1872-1878 John Gordon Sprigg 1881-1884 Thomas Charles Scanlen 1884-1886 Thomas Uppington 1886-1890 Gordon Sprigg 1890-1896 Cecil John Rhodes 1896-1896 Gordon Sprigg 1898-1900 William Philip Schreiner 1900-1904 Gordon Sprigg 1904-1908 Leander Starr Jameson 1908–1910 John X.
