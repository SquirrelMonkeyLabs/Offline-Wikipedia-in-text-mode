Gottselig was only the second player born in the Russian Empire to play in the NHL. During his time with the Black Hawks, he won the Stanley Cup two time, once in 1934 and once in 1938. He was named the captain of the Black Hawks during the time that they won their second Stanley Cup. He retired in 1945 and became the coach of the Black Hawks in 1944. This made him the first European-born head coach in NHL history. He was also the Director of Public Relations for the Black Hawks when they won the Stanley Cup in 1961.
