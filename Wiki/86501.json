 "text": "Yantra literally means loom, instrument or machine. In actual practice, a yantra is a symbol which represents aspects of the divine, such as the Mother Goddess or Durga. It is made of interlocking geometric figures, circles, triangles and floral shapes that form a pattern. Though drawn in two dimensions, a yantra can represent a three dimensional sacred object. The yantra is primarily a meditation tool. Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths. ==Gallery== File:Sri Yantra Correct Colors Johari 1974.jpg| sri chakra File:Ashtamatrika yantra.jpg| ashta matruka yantra File:Bhagalamukhi yantra color.jpg| bahalamukhu yantra File:Bhuvaneswari yantra color.jpg| bhuvaneswari yantra | antargata yoga yaMtra File:Kali yantra color.jpg| kali yantra File:Tripura-bhairavi yantra color.jpg| tripurabhairava yantra File:Kamala_yantra_color.jpg| kamana yantra File:Chinnamasta_yantra_color.jpg| chinnamasta yantra File:Dhumavati_yantra_color.jpg| dhoomavathi yantra ==Related pages== * Mandala * Tantra ==References== * Khanna, Madhu (1979).
