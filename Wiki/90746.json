 "text": "Paul Hindemith (pronounce: powl HIN-deh-mitt; 16 November 1895 in Hanau - 28 December 1963 in Frankfurt am Main) was a German composer, violist, teacher, music theorist and conductor. He was one of the most important and influential German composers during the years between the two World Wars. His style was at first influenced by Schoenberg and Expressionism, but gradually it became more neo-classical, and he turned against Schoenberg's whole approach. He was also famous as a viola player and composed a concerto for viola and orchestra. == References == Category:1895 births Category:1963 deaths Category:20th-century German composers Category:Deaths from pancreatitis Category:Entertainers from Hesse Category:German academics Category:German conductors Category:People from Hanau Category:Violists",
