 "text": "Sam Alexander (ca. 1920s-1997) was a 20th-century sideshow attraction. His stage name was The Man with Two Faces. As a young man and an employee of the Schubert Theater in Chicago, Illinois, his carelessness with a lit cigarette caused a gasoline explosion that burned off his face. After a year in the hospital and then a stay in a nursing home, Alexander began wearing a mask and joined a Peter Kortes sideshow. Alexander would tell his story to the audience and then remove his mask. It was a shocking exhibition. Alexander was made the blow-off for the show. Alexander went on to work with Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey. At Madison Square Garden in the 1960s, ladies were so shocked by his face that he was ordered off the stage. He later worked with the Clyde Beatty Circus. He later started his own sideshow company. Alexander had 72 operations throughout his life to repair his face, all were unsuccessful. Eventually, he decided the remaining years of his life were not best spent behind the mask. He died in 1997. ==References== * Hartzman, Marc. 2006.
