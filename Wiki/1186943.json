 "text": "Uranium-232 () is an isotope of uranium. It has a half-life of about 69 years. It is also made in the the thorium cycle. Some scientists wanted to use 233U as the fissile material(something that does nuclear fission when it is hit by a neutron) for nuclear proliferation. However, 233U turns into Uranium-232 during nuclear fission, which turns into 208Tl. This isotope then emits a lot of gamma radiation. The gamma radiation makes 233U difficult to handle.Griffin, H.
