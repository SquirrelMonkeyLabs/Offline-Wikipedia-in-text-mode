 "text": "The Branch Davidians, or simply, The Branch\", are a religious group that split in 1955 from the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists. The Davidians divided from the Adventists around 1930. Most of them had been removed from membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church because of their beliefs. The reform movement believed themselves to be living in the last millennium, when the bible prophecies of Christ's second coming. The name \"Branch Davidian\" is widely known for the Waco Siege of 1993 on their property near Waco, Texas. The 51-day siege, by the ATF, FBI, and Texas National Guard, resulted in the deaths of the Branch Davidians' leader David Koresh, 82 other Branch Davidian men, women, and children, and four ATF agents. ==References== ==Other websites== *The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists Category:New religious movements Category:Christian denominations Category:1955 establishments in the United States Category:Cults Category:1950s establishments in Texas Category:1993 in the United States Category:1990s in Texas Category:Christian organizations based in the United States",
