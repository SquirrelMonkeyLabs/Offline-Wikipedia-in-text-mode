 "text": "Marilyn Manson is a rock band, and also the name of the lead singer of the group. The name Marilyn Manson was taken from the first name of actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe and the last name of cult leader and serial killer Charles Manson. Some of the earlier band members also created stage names by taking the first name of a female sex symbol and the last name of a serial killer. ==Band history== When the band started in 1989 it was originally called Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. The band had four bandmembers and a drumming machine. They played small concerts in their home state Florida (the Warner family had moved from Ohio to Florida when Manson was a teenager). In 1993 frontman Manson met Trent Reznor, lead singer for Nine Inch Nails. Reznor liked their style and offered them a record deal and the chance to tour with Nine Inch Nails. To get the deal, the band had to change its name to just Marilyn Manson. They also had to find a real drummer. In 1995, their cover of Sweet Dreams (originally by Eurythmics) became a hit, and the band was suddenly very popular. The band is very good friends with Nat Morley who is often featured in their music videos. ==Discography== Their first album was Portrait of an American Family, which was released in 1993. Other Marilyn Manson albums are * Smells Like Children (1995) (EP) * Antichrist Superstar (1996) * Remix & Repent (1997) (EP) * Mechanical Animals (1998) * The Last Tour On Earth (1999) (live album) * Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000) * The Golden Age of Grotesque (2003) * Lest We Forget (2004) (greatest hits) * Eat Me, Drink Me (2007) * High End Of Low (2009) * Born Villain (2012) * The Pale Emperor (2015) * Heaven Upside Down (2017) * We Are Chaos (2020) * One Assassination Under God (2024) Some of their greatest hits are The Beautiful People, Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), The Dope Show, Disposable Teens, Tainted Love, and Personal Jesus. Marilyn Manson's songs about drugs, violence and anti-Christianity caused a lot of trouble, especially among Christians. There were protests at his concerts and they were not allowed to play in some cities. ==References== Category:1989 establishments in the United States Category:1980s American music groups Category:1980s establishments in Florida Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American heavy metal bands Category:Fort Lauderdale, Florida Category:Musical groups established in 1989 Category:Musical groups from Florida",
