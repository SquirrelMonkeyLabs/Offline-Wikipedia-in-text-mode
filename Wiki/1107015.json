 "text": "Ota's stream tree frog (Buergeria oxycephala) is a frog. It lives in Taiwan. People see this frog in places without too many trees, near streams and other bodies of water. They do not usually swim in the middles of rivers. The female frog lays eggs on plants or the bottoms of water that is not deep. The eggs hatch in one to one and a half days. The tadpoles live near the bottom of the water and eat plants and dead things. They see this frog between 0 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog is not danger of dying out. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
