 "text": "The Duarte Province is a Dominican province; it is found in the northeastern part of the country. It has the name of one of the Founding Fathers of the country, Juan Pablo Duarte. It was created in 1896 as a district (an old country subdivision) with the name Distrito Pacificador but the Constitution of 1907 changed all districts to provinces. In 1925 its name was changed to Duarte. ==Location== The Duarte province is bordered on the east by the María Trinidad Sánchez and Samaná provinces, on the south by the Monte Plata and Sánchez Ramírez provinces, on the west by the La Vega and Hermanas Mirabal provinces and on the north by the Espaillat and María Trinidad Sánchez provinces. ==History== The area that currently forms the Duarte province was originally part of La Vega province until 1885 when it was made part of the Espaillat province. In 1896, this part of the country was made a province, including some coastal towns that are now part of the María Trinidad Sánchez province. With the creation of this last province in 1959, the Duarte province lost all coastal areas and became a landlocked province (surrounded by other provinces by all sides). At this time, the municipalities of the Duarte province were San Francisco de Macorís, Castillo, Pimentel and Villa Riva, with Hostos as a municipal district. Arenoso was made a municipality in 1993, Las Guáranas in 1998 and Hostos (with the name of Eugenio María de Hostos) in 2004. The municipal districts of the province were created in: * 1998 : Agua Santa del Yuna, Cristo Rey de Guaraguao and La Peña * 2000 : Cenoví * 2003 : Las Coles and Las Taranas * 2004 : Sabana Grande * 2006 : Barraquito, El Aguacate, Jaya and Presidente Don Antonio Guzmán Fernández ==Population== In (last national census), there were people living in the Duarte province, and 191,878 () living in towns and cities.
