 "text": "Pedernales is a Dominican city and the capital of the Pedernales province, in the southwest of the country close to the border with Haiti. ==Name== The name of \"Pedernales\" was given to the town when it was founded because that was the name of the river that now is the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Pedernales or silex (\"flint\") is the name of a hard mineral that is common in the region. ==History== Before the conquest of the island by European people, some native groups lived around the place where the city of Pedernales is now. But soon those groups disappeared and very few people came to live here because it is a very dry region. When the French colony of Saint- Domingue (present Haiti) was created, the Pedernales river was the southern border between that colony and the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo (present Dominican Republic). During those colonial times, some soldiers came here for some time but almost nobody lived here for a long time. In 1927, the Dominican government brought farmers from other places of the country and made a town for them; the new town was given the name of Pedernales and its first administrator was Sócrates Nolasco who later became a well-known writer. The town became, in 1938, a municipal district (an administrative division of a municipality in the Dominican Republic) of Enriquillo, province of Barahona. When the Pedernales province was created in 1957, the town of Pedernales became the capital of the new province. ==Population== The municipality had, in , a total population of 14,590: 7,473 men and 7,117 women.
