 "text": "The Mollicutes are a class of bacteria with no bacterial cell wall.The word \"Mollicutes\" is derived from the Latin mollis (meaning \"soft\" or \"pliable\"), and cutis (meaning \"skin\").Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Mollicutes. Mycoplasma is the best-known genus. They are very small, only about 0.2–0.3 μm in size, and have a very small genome. Most move about by gliding across host cells, but Spiroplasma are helical and move by twisting. Mollicutes are parasites of various animals and plants, living on or in the host's cells. Many cause diseases in humans. Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma stick to cells in the lungs or sex tubes like the urethra. Phytoplasma and Spiroplasma are plant pathogens with insect vectors. Bugs such as leaf-hoppers (Homoptera) are the vectors. They deliver the parasites when they stick their mouth-parts into a plant to suck its sap. == References == Category:Bacteria",
