The song has received mostly positive feedback.https://www.amazon.com/Ram-Ranch-Grant-MacDonald/product- reviews/B009H43Z9S The song has been used in internet trolling in a way similar to rickrolling, usually with a fake hyperlink that looks like it leads something else, but goes to the song instead. Several sequels to Ram Ranch have been released, usually named via numbers, with the most recent being Ram Ranch 778 released in December 2024. == Freedom Convoy == The song was used in 2022 during the Canada convoy protest. The song was used by counter-protesters to flood Zello channels, to troll protesters at the protests. Since Ram Ranch became a song of resistance in Ottawa, MacDonald has recorded a new rendition — one of over 540 riffs on the original — specifically about protesters in the nation's capital. == References == Category:2012 songs Category:COVID-19 pandemic",
