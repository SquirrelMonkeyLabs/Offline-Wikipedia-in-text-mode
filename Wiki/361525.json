 "text": "A whipping boy was a young boy who grew up with a young prince. If the prince did something wrong, the whipping boy was punished instead of the prince. Because both grew up together, punishing the whipping boy had strong psychological effects on the prince. In England this was very common. For instance, the English king Charles I had many whipping boys for his son. Category:Monarchy Category:Metaphors",
