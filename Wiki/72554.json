 "text": "The Kurgan model of Indo-European origins is about both the people and their Proto-Indo-European language. It uses both archaeology and linguistics to show the history of their culture at different stages of the Indo-European expansion. The Kurgan model is the most widely accepted theory on the origins of Indo-European. :\"The Kurgan solution is attractive and has been accepted by many archaeologists and linguists, in part or total. It is the solution one encounters in the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Grand Dictionnaire Encyclopédique Larousse\".Mallory J.P. 1991.

Dictionary of historical and comparative linguistics. Routledge, 163. ==Background== When it was first suggested in 1956, Marija Gimbutas's answer to the question of Indo-European origins was a pioneering interdisciplinary synthesis of archaeology and linguistics. From the nineties on, new archaeological evidence from Northern European prehistoric cultures was put forward on the influence and expansion of Kurgan cultures.Dexter, Miriam Robbins & Jones-Bley, Karlene eds. 1997.
