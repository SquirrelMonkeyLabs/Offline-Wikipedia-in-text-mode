 "text": "The Scottish Football Association Challenge Cup (usually known as the Scottish Cup) is the national football cup competition of Scotland. The trophy is the oldest football national trophy in the world. Matches are currently broadcasted live by both BBC and Premier Sports. ==History== The Scottish Cup started in the 1873-74 season, and 16 teams played to try to win it. The trophy was first won by Queen's Park when they beat Clydesdale 2–0 in the final in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. While the FA Cup is the oldest cup competition in the world, the trophy awarded to the Scottish Cup winners is the oldest trophy, being minted in 1885.Official Site of the Tennent's Scottish Cup
