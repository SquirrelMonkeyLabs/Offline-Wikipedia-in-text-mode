 "text": "A Churro is a fried-dough pastry-based snack, sometimes made from potato dough, that originated in Portugal. It's popular in Latin America, France, Portugal, the United States, and Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands. There are two types of churros in Spain. One is long and fat (porra), and the other, extra popular in Madrid, is thin and has knots. They are both eaten for breakfast or as a treat with chocolate or sugar.
