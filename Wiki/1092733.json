People have seen it between 50 and 2000 meters above sea level. This is small and strong. This frog has rough skin on its back and vomerine teeth in its jaw. The adult male frog is 31-35 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 36-40 mm long. This frog lives in forests, including bamboo forests and forests with both bamboo and trees. The frog lays eggs in in holes in trees or bamboo that have water in them. The male frog watches the eggs until they hatch. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. The female frog lays eggs that cannot hatch in the water for the tadpoles to eat. This frog can live on bamboo farms. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings change the places where it lives. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. Sometimes people sell this frog as a pet. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
