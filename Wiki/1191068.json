 "text": "The Great Plains Black History Museum is in the historic Jewell Building in North Omaha, Nebraska. It has more than 100,000 items like books, photos, and papers about Black history on the Great Plains, making it the largest museum of its kind in the area. The museum was started by Bertha Calloway in 1976 to teach people about the history and contributions of African Americans in the Midwest. It was first located in the old Webster Telephone Exchange Building, which had also been a community center. The museum closed in 2001 due to funding issues but reopened in new locations. Since 2017, it has been in the Jewell Building, where it continues to host exhibits and events. In 2022, it gave its old building to the Bertha Calloway Foundation. == References ==",
