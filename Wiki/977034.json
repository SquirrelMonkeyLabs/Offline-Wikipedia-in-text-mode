 "text": "HAC-Nordstern was an Austrian football club from the Vienna district of Hietzing, which played at its most successful time from 1935 to 1937 in the second division. ==History== The history goes back to Hietzinger AC, which entered the Austrian championship in 1912/13 and started playing in what was then the lowest level, the II. Class C, West. In 1920 they merged with the small club Nordstern 1912. Although the club played for a long time in the lowest league, HAC-Nordstern produced the later Wunderteam player Karl Gall. For a total of three seasons, from 1934/35 to 1936/37, HAC-Nordstern played in the second level before they were relegated. A merger with the company team of the shoe factory Standard caused a temporary renaming to SC Standard Vienna. The club collapsed during the Second World War.
