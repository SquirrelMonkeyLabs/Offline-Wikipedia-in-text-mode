 "text": "The PlayStation 3 (PS3) has come a long way since it first hit the shelves. When it launched on November 17, 2006, it came with version 1.00 of its system software. This version introduced the XrossMediaBar (XMB) interface, Blu-ray playback, and basic online features. Over the years, Sony rolled out several major updates. For instance, version 2.00, released on November 8, 2007, brought themes, remote start, and the ability to turn off the system using the controller. Then, on September 1, 2009, version 3.00 came out with a redesigned XMB, dynamic themes, and better Trophy support. A year later, version 3.50 added support for 3D Blu-ray playback. In December 2011, version 4.00 prepared the PS3 for PlayStation Vita connectivity and added new PSN features. Fast forward to April 19, 2016, version 4.80 focused on improving system stability and adding minor features. Subsequent updates, like versions 4.81 through 4.91, continued to enhance system stability and security, with the latest update being on February 27, 2024. The PS3 runs on a custom operating system called CellOS or GameOS, which is based on FreeBSD and NetBSD. The XMB interface, also used in other Sony products like the PSP and certain BRAVIA TVs, is the main graphical user interface. Updates can be downloaded directly to the PS3, transferred via USB from a PC, or installed from game discs. Overall, the PS3 system software has evolved to improve user experience, security, and compatibility with new technologies. ==References== https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/ Category:PlayStation (brand)",
