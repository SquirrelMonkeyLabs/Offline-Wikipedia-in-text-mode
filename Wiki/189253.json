He won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature. ==And Quiet Flows the Don== Sholokhov was accused of plagiarizing And Quiet Flows the Don, which made his international reputation. Sholokhov's detractors claimed that it was written by Fyodor Kryukov, a Cossack and anti-Bolshevik, who died in 1920. In 1987, several thousand pages of notes and drafts of the work were discovered and authenticated, including chapters excluded from the final draft. An analysis of the novel has unambiguously proved Sholokhov's authorship. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov's own hand, and 285 are transcribed by his wife Maria and sisters. ==Legacy== An asteroid in main- belt is named after him, 2448 Sholokhov. ==Related pages== * List of Nobel Prize winners by country *List of Russian-language novelists ==References== == Other websites == Category:1905 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Russian novelists Category:Russian Nobel Prize winners Category:Russian writers Category:Soviet writers",
