She advocated the separation of Pakistan as an independent state when the Raj ended. After the independence of Pakistan, Jinnah co-founded the All Pakistan Women's Association, which helped settle the migrants in the new country. After the death of her brother, she was a prominent philanthropist, but was not politically active until 1965. Then she took part in the Pakistani presidential election against the military Dictator Ayub Khan. She lost the primary because of election rigging by the Pakistan Army.
