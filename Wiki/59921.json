 "text": "Francesco Botticini (real name Francesco di Giovanni, 1446 â€“ 16 January 1498Getty Museum entry.) was an Italian painter. He lived in the early part of the Renaissance period. He was born in Florence about 1446 and is best known for his painting called \"Assumption of the Virgin\". He died in 1497 or 1498. After he had been an assistant to the painter Neri di Bicci he started his own workshop. The shop was famous for its decorative works, a few of which can be seen in the cloistered church of Empoli. Botticini was influenced by Filippino Lippi and Botticelli who were two very famous Florentine painters. ==Gallery== Image:Francesco di Giovanni Botticini - Saint Sebastian.jpg|Saint Sebastian Image:CeciliaValerianTiburtius.jpg|Saints Cecilia, Valerian, and Tiburtius Image:Francesco_Botticini_-_The_Assumption_of_the_Virgin.jpg|The Assumption of the Virgin ==Related pages== * List of Italian painters == References == Category:15th-century Italian painters Category:People from Florence Category:1446 births Category:1498 deaths",
