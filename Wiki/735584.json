 "text": "Penguins are a type of biscuit that is made with milk chocolate and chocolate cream. They are made in Lancashire. Pladis' manufacturing division McVitie's makes them at their factory in Stockport. ==History== They were first made in 1932 by William McDonald, a biscuit manufacturer in Glasgow. They became a brand of McVitie's when McDonald joined with McVitie's and Price, MacFarlane Lang & Co and Crawford to create United Biscuits in 1948. Each wrapper has a joke or \"funny fact\" printed on it and designs that feature penguins that are often in styles like that of famous works of art. These designs are usually funny. In the 1980s, Penguin became known for their television advertising slogan \"P...P...P...Pick up a penguin!” In October 1996, United Biscuits sued Asda because they said Asda said their own brand of \"Puffin\" biscuits were part of the Penguin brand. In March 1997, United Biscuits won the case. The court found out Asda had not broken any laws on how the Penguin brand could be used. United Biscuits was criticised for still using trans fatty acids in the cream filling of Penguins. By December 2007, United Biscuits began to publicly say trans fats are not in Penguins anymore. The Tim Tam made by Arnott's in Australia was based on the Penguin. Occasional references in the media include tongue-in-cheek debates over which biscuit is better. == Types == There are currently three versions of the biscuit: *Chocolate *Orange *Mint ==Spin off brands== In 2002, McVitie's made some versions of the Penguin biscuit: Penguin Chukkas, Wing Dings, Flipper Dipper, Splatz and Mini Splatz. There is a £5 million promotional campaign for the biscuits. In 2008, McVitie's also made Penguin triple chocolate wafers.McVities 'chukks' £5m behind Penguin brand, Food & Drink Europe, 3 June 2003.
