 "text": "The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in Charlotte, North Carolina. They play their home games at the Spectrum Center. Most of the team is owned by Michael Jordan, who was a star player for the Chicago Bulls in the 1980s and 1990s. The team started playing in 2004 as the Charlotte Bobcats, and was the second NBA team to play in Charlotte (the New Orleans Pelicans had played in Charlotte as the Hornets from 1988 to 2002). In 2010, the Bobcats made the playoffs for the first time. After the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans in 2013, they gave the \"Hornets\" name back to the NBA. The Bobcats soon announced they would rename themselves the Hornets beginning with the 2014â€“15 NBA season, and the name change became official on May 20, 2014. At the time of the change to \"Hornets\", the team also said that it had reached a deal with the NBA and the Pelicans to split the Pelicans' history and records between the two teams: *Records from the first Charlotte Hornets while in that city (1988 to 2002) belong to the current Hornets. *Records from the first Hornets' move to New Orleans in 2002 until that team's name change to Pelicans in 2013 belong to the Pelicans. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:National Basketball Association teams Category:Sports in Charlotte, North Carolina Category:2004 establishments in North Carolina",
