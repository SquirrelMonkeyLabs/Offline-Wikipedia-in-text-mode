 "text": "Seniman Bujang Lapok (English: The Nitwit Movie Stars) is a 1961 Singaporean Malay comedy film directed by P. Ramlee. It is the fourth film in the Bujang Lapok series and the last one with P. Ramlee, S. Shamsuddin, and Aziz Sattar. This film does not continue the story from the previous Bujang Lapok movies. The film is a comedy about the Malay film industry in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It shows a group of friends trying to become actors and gives a fictional look at how films were made back then. It mixes real places and actors using their real names. Most of the original film reels were damaged and couldn't be fixed, but in 2017, one company saved the last 8 minutes of the film. ==Songs== * Menchecheh Bujang Lapok * Gelora * Senandung Kasih * Embun Menitik (by late Ahmad Patek) The songs were sung by Saloma, P.
