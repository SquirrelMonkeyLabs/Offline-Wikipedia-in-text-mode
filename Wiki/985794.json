 "text": "The Altiplano (Spanish for \"high plain\"), Collao (Quechua and Aymara: Qullaw, meaning \"place of the Qulla\") or Andean Plateau, is the largest high plateau on Earth outside Tibet. It is in South America. Most of the Altiplano is in Bolivia. Its northern parts are in Peru, and its southwestern parts are in Chile. There are many cities on the Altiplano. These include El Alto, La Paz, Oruro, and Puno. The northeastern part of the Altiplano is more humid than the southwestern part. The southwestern part has several salares (salt flats) because of its aridity. At the Bolivia–Peru border lies Lake Titicaca. This lake is the largest lake in South America. Many pre-Columbian cultures come from the Altiplano. These include the Chiripa, Tiawanaku and the Inca Empire. Spain conquered the region in the 16th century. Today, major economic activities in the Altiplano include mining, llama and vicuña herding, and services (in its cities). Many tourists visit the region.
