 "text": "Misokinesia is a condition where people feel very uncomfortable or upset when they see certain movements made by others. It can create feelings of rage and distraction when a person with misokinesia sees people fidget or make repetitive motions. Some examples of these motions or movements are leg shaking, hair twirling, and finger tapping. About one in three people might experience some level of misokinesia. Misokinesia is often found alongside a similar condition called misophonia. Scientists are still learning about misokinesia, and more research is being done to understand it better. == References == Category:Psychology",
