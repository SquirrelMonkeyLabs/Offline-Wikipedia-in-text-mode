 "text": "The WAGR M class were a total of two steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1876 to 1911. The WAGR M class were built by Kitson & Coy of Leeds, England in 1875 for the Northern Railway from Geraldton to Northampton, this being the first government railway in Western Australia. Both engines were used extensively on this line due to its isolation from the rest of the system and the failure of the E class. On the Northern Railway, they were numbered 1 and 2 but were renumbered to 23 and 24 in 1891. In 1893 both engines were reallocated to Fremantle to be used on the Eastern Railway from Fremantle to Guildford. No. 24 was sold to Whittaker Brothers in 1907, while No. 23 was sold in 1911 to Bunning Brothers. No. 23 was withdrawn from timber service in 1946 before being scrapped in 1958; No. 24 was named Dandalup and sold to Bunning Brothers who numbered it 4 before scrapping it in 1955.
