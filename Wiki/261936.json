The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state. ==Properties== It is a white solid. It is a weak reducing agent in air. It oxidizes to mercury(II) oxide and mercury(II) nitrate. It reacts slowly with water when it is dissolved in water. This makes a basic mercury(I) nitrate and some nitric acid. The basic mercury(I) nitrate is yellow. Mercury(I) nitrate can kill you if you eat or inhale it. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting mercury with a dilute solution of nitric acid. A concentrated solution of nitric acid makes mercury(II) nitrate. ==Related pages== *Mercury(II) chloride *Mercury(I) chloride ==References== Category:Nitrates Category:Mercury compounds",
