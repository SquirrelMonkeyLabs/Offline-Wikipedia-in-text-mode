 "text": "The lowland rocket frog (Ectopoglossus atopoglossus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives in forests in low places and on hills. Scientists saw the frog between 1000 and 2260 meters above sea level in wet places and in streams that had plants in them. Scientists think this frog might live in one protected park: Reserva Natural Cerro El Ingles. ==Young== Male frogs sit on plants in water or on rocks near water and call to the female frogs. Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Humans change the places where it lives to make farms and to get wood to build with. Some of the farms are against the law. Bad chemicals from farms, can also kill this frog. Scientists have seen the fungal disease chytridiomycosis near where the frog lives, but they are not sure if it has killed many of this frog or not. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
