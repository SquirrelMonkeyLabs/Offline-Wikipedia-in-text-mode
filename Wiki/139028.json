 "text": "In Brazil, the Civil Police () is the country's investigative state police forces. The Civil Police are under the authority of the federative units of Brazil. The federative units' job is to protect public safety and keep public order. Article 144 of the Federal Constitution of 1988 gives this job to the federative units (and their agency, the Civil Police). Each of the states of Brazil has its own Civil Police Department, which carries out detective work, forensics, and criminal investigations. Each Civil Police Department acts as a state bureau of investigation. ==Description== The Civil Police of Brazil began as the General Intendancy of Police, created in Rio de Janeiro on May 10, 1808. The General Intendancy was later re-organized and renamed the Civil Police. Today, the Constitution of Brazil says that the Civil Police must exist. This is stated in article 144, IV and 144 § 4°, of the Federal Constitution. ==Organization== There are 27 civil police forces in Brazil, one for each state. They are directed by a Head of Police, who is elected. Judiciary police have control over small cities or quarters of the large cities. ==Other websites== Category:Government of Brazil Category:Law enforcement agencies Category:Law of Brazil",
