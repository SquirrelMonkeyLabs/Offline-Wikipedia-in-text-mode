Wires were visible hanging out, as well as a black towel. Reports also indicate the device had a timer attached. In a statement after the incident, Prime Minister Theresa May said: \"My thoughts are with those injured at Parsons Green and the emergency services who, once again, are responding swiftly and bravely to a suspected terrorist incident.\" ==References== Category:2017 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2017 in London Category:2010s building bombings Category:2010s crimes in London Category:2010s explosions in Europe Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2017 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in London Category:Attacks on railway systems Category:Attacks on transport in the United Kingdom Category:Building bombings in England Category:Explosions in 2017 Category:Explosions in London Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2017 Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom Category:September 2017 events Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2017 Category:Terrorist incidents in London Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in the 2010s Category:2010s disasters in the United Kingdom",
