 "text": "Snipping Tool is a screenshot tool that is made by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems. It can take a screenshot of an open window, rectangular areas, free-form areas, or all of the screen. Snipping Tool also has simple editing tools, like different colored pens, an eraser, and a highlighter. A delay option was added to Snipping Tool on June 2015. The delay option lets the program wait from 0 to 5 seconds before making a screenshot. It was replaced on October 2018 by a similar program, Snip & Sketch. ==References== Category:Microsoft software Category:Graphics software",
