When a legal counselor calls, days some time recently Christmas, to illuminate him that his offended mother has passed absent and cleared out her house to him, Jacob returns not fair to settle the bequest but to undertake and accommodate with the past and the torment and mishandle he experienced as a child. Too, perhaps cleaning out her house will be somewhat less discouraging than investing the occasions alone, observing re-runs of Christmas classics. But because it turns out, the house holds more than fair troublesome recollections, Jacob's mother had gotten to be a hoarder and he must unearth through two decades worth of clutter. ==Cast== * Justin Hartley * Bonnie Bedelia * Treat Williams * James Remar ** Barrett Doss ** Vivian Full ** Aaron Costa Ganis ** Essence Atkins ** Andrea Sooch (Full cast on IMDb ) ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:American drama movies",
