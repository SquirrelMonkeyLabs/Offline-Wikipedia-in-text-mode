 "text": "Samsung Galaxy is a series of mobile devices made by Samsung. Most of them are smartphones and tablet computers that run Android, an operating system made by Google. New models come out every year. The first Samsung Galaxy phone came out in June 2009. There are many different models of phones. Each of them is different, such as in the size of their screens or what features it has, but the best of them is the Galaxy S series. The most recent Galaxy S phones are the Samsung Galaxy S23, S23+ and S23 Ultra, which were all released in February 2023. Of the other Galaxy phones, the now-discontinued Galaxy Note series has a bigger screen and a stylus pen. The most recent of these, the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra, were both released in August 2020. The first Samsung Galaxy Tab came out in September 2010. The most recent are the Galaxy Tab S9, S9+, S9 Ultra and A9 10.5, which all announced in August 2023. Like the phones, there are different models of Galaxy tablets, which can have screen sizes from 8 inches all the way up to 16 inches. Some models have keyboards that plug into the device to make it easier to type, while others have a stylus, like the Galaxy Note phones. Although most of the Galaxy tablets use Android, some of the newer ones, such as the Galaxy TabPro S, use Windows 10 instead. Samsung also makes smartwatches under the Galaxy brand. The first of these was the Galaxy Gear, which came out in September 2013. The company has since made some new models, including the Galaxy Gear Live in June 2014, but later ones are branded as Samsung Galaxy Watch and Samsung Galaxy Active. The most recent is the Galaxy Watch 6. Besides their own products, Samsung also made the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus phones, and the Nexus 10 tablet. These are all part of Google's own Nexus series of phones. Unlike Samsung's own phones, they have no extra mobile apps added or changes made to the user interface. ==References== Category:Samsung mobile phones",
