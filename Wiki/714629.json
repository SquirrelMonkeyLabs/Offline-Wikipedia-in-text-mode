The Otoe language, Chiwere, is part of the Siouan family, and it is related to that of the Iowa and Missouri tribes. Historically, the Otoe Tribe lived as a semi-nomadic people on the Central Plains along the bank of the Missouri River in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. They lived in elm- bark houses while they farmed. They used tipis when they traveled, like many other Plains tribes. They often left their villages to hunt buffalo. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Native Americans",
