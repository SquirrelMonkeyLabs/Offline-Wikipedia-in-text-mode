It is meant to be spoken aloud in oral traditions. The poem also talks about the relationship between humans and nature. It helps people feel refreshed and connected to the world around them. The spring season represents a new start. It shows that Earth is full of life again. The sun brings a new day and spreads light over the villages. This gives hope and inspires people to connect emotionally with the ancient Meitei way of life. Seasonal changes show the natural order of the universe. The changing seasons are like the stages of a personâ€™s life: from birth to adulthood, old age, and death. This reminds people that death is a natural part of life. The seasons also help people learn about celestial events. This helps make a calendar for farmers. The calendar tells them when to plant their crops. Without it, farming would be hard to manage. == References == Category:Meitei literature Category:Poetry Category:Meitei music",
