 "text": "A mobile game is a video game designed to be played on mobile phones or tablets. The first game ever played on a mobile phone was a version of Tetris, which was available on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device in 1994. In 1997, Nokia introduced a game called Snake. It was already installed on many Nokia mobile devices and has become one of the most popular games. The Nokia 6110 had a version of Snake that allowed two players to play using the infrared port, making it the first of many two-player games for mobile phones. Nowadays, mobile games are typically downloaded from an app store. However, there are also instances where games come pre-installed on handheld devices by the manufacturer or mobile operator. This can be done through an infrared connection, Bluetooth, memory card, or by directly transferring the game to the device using a cable. ==References==",
