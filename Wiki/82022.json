It was found by Scott S. Sheppard, et al. in 2003 and given the designation S/2003 U 3.IAU Circular 8217 Confirmed as Uranus XXIII, it was named after the servant of Hero in William Shakespeare's play Much Ado About NothingPlanetary names USGS. ==Orbit== Margaret stands out as the only prograde non-spherical moon of Uranus. The diagram illustrates the orbital parameters of Margaret, unique among the non-spherical moons of Uranus, with inclination on the vertical axis and the eccentricity of the orbits represented by the segments extending from the pericentre to the apocentre. ==Related pages== *List of Uranus' moons https//ifarley.net ==References== * Ephemeris: IAU-NSES * Mean orbital parameters: NASA JPL ==Other websites== *Margaret Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration *David Jewitt pages *Scott Sheppard pages Category:Uranus' moons",
