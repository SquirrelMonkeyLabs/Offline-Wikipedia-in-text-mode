It was released for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. ==Plot== Shadow the Hedgehog was sent by the leader of the Black Arms, Black Doom to find the seven Chaos Emeralds. Black Doom wants Shadow to give the emeralds to him. Shadow has forgotten everything about himself. He decides to get the Chaos Emeralds so that he will remember who he is. The game has ten endings. In each ending, Shadow has collected the Chaos Emeralds and learns who he is. Once the ten endings are over, a secret ending can be unlocked. Shadow refuses to give the Chaos Emeralds to Black Doom. He learns that Black Doom is his father. Black Doom spreads nerve gas towards Shadow's friends and becomes Devil Doom. Shadow becomes Super Shadow and must defeat Devil Doom. ==Gameplay== Players play the game as Shadow the Hedgehog. The actions of the player choose the overall story of the game. If he does more good actions, he can cause Chaos Control. If he does more evil actions, he can cause Chaos Blast. Shadow can drive in vehicles and use guns he can get from enemies such as the Black Arms and G.U.N. ==Reception== The game was not well liked by critics. Many did not like the game because of the profanity, gun violence, and straying from the more lighthearted tone of past entries. However, some praise was given to the gunplay mechanic. The PlayStation 2 version would be rereleased on the PlayStation 3 storefront under the PS2 Classics catalog, but only in Japan. ==References== Category:2005 video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog spin-off games Category:Sega video games Category:3D platformers Category:Military science fiction video games Category:Nintendo GameCube games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Post- apocalyptic video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video game spin-offs Category:Video games about alien invasions Category:Video games about amnesia Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Video games about terrorism Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Xbox games",
