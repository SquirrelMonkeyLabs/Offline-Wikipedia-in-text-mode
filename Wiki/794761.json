 "text": "The R160 is a class of New Technology subway cars built for the New York City Subway B Division. Entering service between 2006 and 2010, they replaced all R38, R40/A, and NYCT-operated R44 cars, and most R32 and R42 cars. The R160s are very similar to the R143s and R179s. The biggest differences between them are the FIND (Flexible Information and Notice Display) system and their propulsions sounds. To address the 2017 State of Emergency, a Subway Action Plan was executed to refurbish 100 R160s in order to increase capacity and improve the overall experience. These are known as the \"Cuomo wraps\", however multiple R160s receiving similar additions such as the looped stanchions, LED lighting, and display LCD screens. ==Gallery== File:NYC Subway R160 9160 Interior (Retrofitted with R211 features).jpg|Interior (refubrished) File:MTA NYC Subway F train arriving at Avenue P.JPG|Exterior (unrefubrished) Category:New York City Subway Category:Electric multiple units",
