It is a business magazine based in Budapest, providing business news in Hungarian. == History == When Forbes Hungary was launched in early November 2013, it was owned by Forbes Media LLC, just like the American Forbes magazine and the forbes.com website. They shared news and information on business, investment, technology, entrepreneurship, management, and lifestyle. The Forbes magazine, Forbes Asia, and Forbes Europe reached five million people worldwide. The Forbes magazine iPad app combined print media with social media and the internet. The company also published the ForbesLife magazine and 28 other local versions under license. In Central Europe, local editions of Forbes were soon introduced in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Poland, Latvia, Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. When it first appeared, the content of Forbes Hungary was made up of 60 percent Hungarian business news, comments, and articles, and 40 percent editorial content from the American Forbes. ==References== Category:Hungarian news websites Category:Online newspapers Category:Newspapers in Europe",
