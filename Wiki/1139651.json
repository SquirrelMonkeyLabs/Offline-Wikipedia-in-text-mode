 "text": "On 1 October 2024, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at targets in Israel in at least two waves. It is the largest attack during the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. The missile attack was codenamed Operation True Promise 2 () by Iran. The attack caused explosions in multiple areas, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Several direct hits were reported at Israel's Nevatim Airbase in the Negev. Two Israelis were injured, while one Palestinian man was killed, and several Palestinians were injured by rocket debris in Jericho. Two Jordanian civilians were also injured. Iran claimed the attack was in self-defense because of Israel's assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil, as well as its assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan. Iran claimed that 90% of the missiles fired had hit their targets, while Israel stated that the majority of missiles were intercepted. Israel enacted press censorship over the exact locations and degree of the damage. The US Pentagon confirmed that the US Navy had fired around a dozen interceptors, with assistance from unspecified partners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack a \"big mistake\" and said that Iran \"will pay\" for it. ==Notes== ==References== Category:October 2024 events Category:2024 in Israel Category:Airstrikes Category:2024 Iranâ€“Israel conflict",
