 "text": "Luhansk Peopleâ€™s Republic was a partially recognised state in the Donbas region of Ukraine. When the War in Donbas started in 2014, a few hundred separatists proclaimed it in part of the Luhansk Oblast. Luhansk Oblast is to the east of Ukraine, at the Ukrainian border with Russia. Approximately at the same time, other rebels formed the Donetsk People's Republic in Donetsk Oblast. In both parts, there are many ethnic Russians. There was a claim that Russia helped start these unrecognized states. The country is loyal to Russia. In 2022 Russia, Syria and DPRK officially recognised the state along with the Donetsk People's Republic, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In late 2022, the Luhansk People's Republic became a federal subject of Russia alongside three other occupied oblasts. Most of the international community agrees that Luhansk legally belongs to Ukraine. == References == == Other websites == * Category:European countries Category:Eastern European countries Category:2014 establishments in Europe Category:2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Category:Unrecognized countries Category:Puppet states Category:Luhansk Oblast",
