This letter is used in Arabic and other languages that use the Arabic script. == How it sounds == The letter ظ represents a voiced pharyngealized alveolar fricative sound. This means it is pronounced by constricting the throat and making a “z” sound. It is similar to the English “z” but with a deeper, more guttural sound. Example: The word “ظَهر” (ẓuhr) means “back” or “afternoon” in Arabic and is pronounced like “ẓuhr”. == Usage in Arabic == Common Words: The letter ظ appears in many common Arabic words. Example: “ظَريف” (ẓarīf) means “nice” or “charming”. Another example: “ظُلم” (ẓulm) means “injustice”. == Writing forms == The letter ظ changes its shape depending on its position in a word: * Isolated: ظ * Initial: ظـ * Medial: ـظـ * Final: ـظ == Unicode == The letter ظ has special codes in computers: * Unicode: U+0638 These codes are used to represent the letter in digital text. == Arabizi == In Arabizi, a system used to write Arabic using the Latin alphabet and numbers, the letter ظ is represented by the number 6’.
