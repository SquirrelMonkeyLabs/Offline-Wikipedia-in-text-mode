 "text": "Polypedates iskandari is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Laos, and India. People have seen it between 0 and 1008 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in forests, places where the forest was cut down and grew back, farms, towns, and gardens. The tadpoles swim in puddles, ponds, and other bodies of water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
