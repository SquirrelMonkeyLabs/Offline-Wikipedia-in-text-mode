 "text": "A Lord Protector is a British title for heads of state. It has two different meanings at different times in history. The title of Lord Protector was first used by royal princes or other nobles who ruled as regent while the English monarch was still too young to rule or was not able to rule for some other reason, in this case the Lord Protector would make all the decisions for the country, and the young monarch would decide whether they agree or not. The Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was the title of the head of state during the Interregnum, following the first period of the Commonwealth under Council of State government. It was held by Oliver Cromwell (December 1653 – September 1658), leader of the roundheads and his son Richard Cromwell (September 1658 – May 1659) during what is now known as the Protectorate. == List of Lord Protectors == Name Image House Birth Marriage Death Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (1422-1429) Lancaster 3 October 1390 son of Henry IV of England Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut no children Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester no children 23 February 1447 Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (1454-1460) Plantagenet 21 September 1411 Great-grandson of Edward III of England Cecily Neville, Duchess of York twelve children 1 January 1461 Richard, Duke of Gloucester (1483) York 2 October 1451 son of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York and Great-Great-grandson of Edward III of England Anne Neville one son 22 August 1485 Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (1547-1549) Seymour 1500 Catherine Fillol Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset 22 January 1552 Category:Heads of state Category:Titles",
