 "text": "The Stabyhoun or Stabij is a rare dog breed. There are only about 6000 dogs of this type in the world. It is a spaniel type of working dog. ==History== The Stabyhoun was first noted in the Netherlands in the early 1800s where it was used as a working dog on farms and for hunting, specifically in the province of Friesland. ==Colour== These dogs are usually black and white, with a smaller number being brown and white and very small number of yellow and white examples. ==Temperment== The Stabyhoun is a gentle breed that is patient with children and other dogs. To keep them happy, like all gun dogs, they need a lot of exercise. ==References== Category:Spaniels Category:FCI breeds Category:Frisian culture Category:Dog breeds originating in the Netherlands Category:Rare dog breeds",
