With the instigation of Ahlat, Erzurum and Amid-Mardin emirs, Ayyubids, Kharizmşahs and Seljuks faced each other.https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/pub/sema/issue/74143/1225938 ===Ahlat=== While the siege of Ahlat was continuing, important political developments occurred, and the Artuqid emirs of Amid and Mardin, as well as the Seljuk emir of Erzurum, Rukneddin Cihanshah, joined Celaleddin and sent him a large catapult and war materials. The Emir of Amid and Hisni Keyfa, Melik Masud, and the Emir of Mardin, Melik el Mansur, wanted to support Celaleddin against the Seljuk Sultan of Anatolia and the Ayyubid kings of Egypt and Syria. Meanwhile, Celaleddin Khwarazmshah ignored Alaaddin Keykubad's warnings and continued the siege of Ahlat. The walls were battered with the catapults that were set up and the siege continued. Although the people of Ahlat did not like Taqi al-Din Abbas and Mujiruddin Yaqub, the brothers of Malik Ashraf, they were forced to help them simply because they were afraid of Khwarazmshah. The intermediaries who came from Baghdad, Syria and Anatolia and tried to lift the siege could not achieve their goal. After a long siege, Jalaluddin Harezmshah finally attacked the city with a massive assault on Sunday, April 14, 1230, and captured it by force of the sword. An incident of treason is mentioned regarding the capture of the city. According to this, Ismail.https://isamveri.org/pdfdrg/D02042/2012_2/2012_2_BOZANO.pdf ===Yassichemen=== The Khwarezmian army was structured enclosing the plain. The alliance units attacked on the Khwarezmian army and the Khwarezmian retaliated in the same way. Jalal al-Din stood on a hill and coordinated his army. During the first day, the alliance seized some positions from the Khwarezmians but the occupiers abandoned the newly captured positions at night. Jalal al-Din refrained from attacking.Aydın, Taneri (1993). Harezmşahlar. Ankara: Türkiye Diyanet Vakfı Yayınları. pp. 82–83. The alliance again started an attack on the next dawn but they were repelled back. After repelling the allied army, the Khwarezmians charged forward and forced Kaykubad I to retreat further. The lost positions were captured back. Al-Ashraf, the commander of the Mamluk army, reinforced Kaykubad's divisions. After seeing the reinforcements, Jalal al-Din concluded that the battle is lost, due to the numerical superiority of the alliance and abandoned the battlefield.Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p. 118 ==References== Category:13th-century conflicts Category:History of Turkey Category:Wars involving Asia",
