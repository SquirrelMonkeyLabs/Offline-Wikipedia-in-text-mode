 "text": "The mourning tree frog (Sarcohyla pentheter) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it pine-oak forests on the west side of the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in Oaxaca. People have seen it between 1,280 and 2,000 meters above sea level. This frog lays eggs in streams. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog, and scientists think it has killed many but are not sure. Human beings also change the places where the frogs live for mining, logging, and to make small farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
