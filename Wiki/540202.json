 "text": "Joo Koon MRT Station (EW29) is a MRT Station in Singapore. It is along the East West MRT Line. It was the terminus station until the Tuas West extension is completed. The station code was originally W14 before the opening. However every alternate trains will still terminate here despite the opening of the TWE. The other half of the westbound train will then proceed to Tuas after Joo Koon. ==History== This station was announced in 2004. Construction began on May 2006 and was completed in 28 February 2009. ===Joo Koon rail accident=== The Joo Koon rail accident occurred on 15 November 2017, when two trains met into accident causing 36 injuries. The stationary train was in the process of being detrained due to a train fault. This incident is the second train collision in Singapore MRT's history, after the Clementi rail accident in 1993. Both trains were operating under the recently installed Thales SelTrac CBTC signalling system at time of incident, and the Minister of Transport Khaw Boon Wan expressed that he was \"disturbed\" by an initial finding that a \"critical safety software\" was inadvertently removed from the stationary train, possibly due to a malfunctioning signalling circuit, had led to the accident. ==References== Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations",
