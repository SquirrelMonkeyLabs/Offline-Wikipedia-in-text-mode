 "text": "Repparfjorden is a fjord in Norway's Hammerfest municipality. The fjord is on Norway's mainland, Southwest of Hammerfest (city). The fjord had been the site of a copper mine in the 1970s. Studies have being done about starting to mine at the fjord again. There have been environmentalists protesting at the fjord to try and stop the mine. Some protesters had attached themselves to excavators at the fjord using chains to try and stop the work from starting. ==References== Category:Bodies of water of Norway Category:Fjords",
