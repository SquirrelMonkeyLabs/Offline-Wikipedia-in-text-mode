 "text": "The inverse element is the opposite of a number or equation. The inverses of x in addition is -x (called the additive inverse), and \\tfrac{1}{x} or x^{-1} in multiplication (called the multiplicative inverse, or reciprocal). In general, given an element g in a group S equipped with an operation \\circ, an inverse element of g is an element g* such that g \\circ g^* and g^* \\circ g are both equal to the identity element (of the group). Other examples of inverse include inverse function and matrix inverse. == Related pages == * Field (mathematics), a set equipped with additive inverses and multiplicative inverses (except for zero) == References == Category:Algebra",
