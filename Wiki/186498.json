In 2004, Nanta opened a long running show on Broadway, in New York, a first for an Asian musical. Nanta is presented through music and motions, so there is no language barrier. This musical combines traditional rhythms of Korean samulnori with modern musical forms including rock music and jazz. This musical creates unique but familiar experience to a world audience. It is a comedy where everyone in the audience can join in the performance. The audience interacts with the performers in many ways. ==References== ==Other websites== * The official web site Category:South Korean music",
