 "text": "Pulp fiction is a kind of literature. It gets its name from the cheap, wood pulp paper it was printed on. Pulp fiction covered several genres: romance, western, science fiction, horror, detective, adventure, etc. It was most popular in the United States during the 1920sâ€“1940s. Publication then decreased, perhaps because television took over the evening hours for readers and magazines were not read as often. Pulp fiction was published in a cheap magazine format often with gaudy covers. Stories were sometimes serialized, meaning the reader had to buy each monthly issue over a period of time to complete a particular story. Category:Fiction books",
