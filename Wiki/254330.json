 "text": "Scott Oliver Hall (October 20, 1958 â€“ March 14, 2022) was an American professional wrestler who was best known for wrestling with both the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the ring name, Razor Ramon and in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) where he wrestled under his real name. Hall was a founding member of the professional wrestling stable, the New World Order (nWo). ==Legal and drug problems== In 1983, he was charged with second-degree murder after he wrestled a gun away from a man and shot him in the head at point blank range with it during an altercation outside of a nightclub. He said it was in self-defense and the charges were dropped because of lack of evidence. He did admit to killing the man, and says he is unable to forget the incident in a 2011 interview with ESPN. Hall has had many other legal and drug problems since the 1990s. Retired professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page invited Hall to join stay at his house to stay sober and rebuild his life. He also invited him to join his yoga program which many current and former professional wrestlers are involved in. ==Death== In March 2022, Hall was hospitalized after falling and breaking his hip. He had hip replacement surgery, but had three heart attacks on March 12, after which he was put on life support at a hospital in Marietta, Georgia. He died after he was taken off life support on March 14, 2022 at the age of 63. ==Championships== *American Wrestling Association **AWA World Tag Team Championship (one time) (with Curt Hennig) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI Match of the Year (1994) (vs. Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match at WrestleMania X) **PWI Most Improved Wrestler of the Year (1992) **PWI Tag Team of the Year (1997) (with Kevin Nash) **He was ranked #7 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the year by PWI in the PWI 500 in 1994. **He was ranked #72 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the \"PWI Years\" in 2003. **He along with Kevin Nash was ranked #40 of the Top 100 Tag Teams of the \"PWI Years\" in 2003. *Total Nonstop Action Wrestling **TNA World Tag Team Championship (one time) (with Kevin Nash and Eric Young) *United States Wrestling Association **USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship (one time) *World Championship Wrestling **WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (two times) **WCW World Tag Team Championship (seven times) (with Kevin Nash (six) and The Giant (one)) **WCW World Television Championship (one time) **WCW World War 3 (1997) *World Wrestling Council **WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship (one time) **WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship (one time) *World Wrestling Federation **WWF Intercontinental Championship (four times) **Slammy Award for US Best Match of the Year (1996) (vs. Shawn Michaels at SummerSlam) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards **Match of the Year (1994) (vs. Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match at WrestleMania X) ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website *WWE profile Category:1958 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls in the United States Category:American murderers Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Deaths from fractured hip Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:Former WWE wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from Florida Category:Sportspeople from Maryland Category:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling alumni Category:WWE Hall of Fame",
