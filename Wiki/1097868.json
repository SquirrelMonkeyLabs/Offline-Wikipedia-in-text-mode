 "text": "The Narayani Sena was the army of Lord Krishna of Dwarka Kingdom and is called the supreme Sena of all time. They were the basic threat to the rival kingdoms. Fearing Narayani Sena, many Kings didn't try fighting against Dwaraka. Because Dwaraka sorted most of the threats through Krishna's politics and the talent of this army. Using Narayani Sena, they extended their empire to most parts of the Indian subcontinent. == References == Category:Hinduism Category:Hindu mythology",
