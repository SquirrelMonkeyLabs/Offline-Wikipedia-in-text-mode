 "text": "Pope Formosus (896) was Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 6 October 891 to his death. His reign as pope was troubled, marked by power struggles over the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Kingdom of West Francia, and the Holy Roman Empire. ==Papacy== During his papacy, Formosus also had to side with the Saracens, who were attacking Lazio. On 4 April 896, Formosus died. He was replaced by Boniface VI, whose papacy lasted 15 days. ==Trial== He sided with Arnulf of Carinthia against Lambert of Spoleto. He was accused of perjury and was put on trial. As a result, Formosus's remains were exhumed and put on trial in the Cadaver Synod. He was found guilty and his body was buried many times at a nearby river. ==References== Category:Italian popes Category:816 births Category:896 deaths Category:Popes",
