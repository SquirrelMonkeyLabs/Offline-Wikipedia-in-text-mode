 "text": "BioShock 2 is the sequel to the first-person shooter game BioShock. The game has some new features, but overall BioShock 2 is very similar to the first game. It takes place 8 years after BioShock. In BioShock 2, the player plays as a Big Daddy, a major enemy from the first game, called Subject Delta. Subject Delta is an early version of the Big Daddy, the Alpha Series. == Story == The game begins in 1958, two years before the events of BioShock. At this time, Rapture has not yet fallen into disorder. Subject Delta is responsible for protecting one specific Little Sister (little girls whose job is to collect ADAM, a liquid that gives people powers) named Eleanor. Eleanor is attacked by Splicers (humans that are addicted to ADAM), but Subject Delta kills the Splicers and tries to rescue Eleanor. However, it turned out that her mother, Sofia Lamb, hired the Splicers to take back Eleanor. She then hypnotizes Subject Delta to kill himself. Ten years, later, eight years after the events of BioShock, Subject Delta mysteriously comes back to life. Since both Andrew Ryan and Frank Fontaine are both dead, Sofia Lamb took over Rapture. Instead of being a society based on objectivism, a philosophy that believes people should only do things based their own self-interest, Rapture is now a collectivist society, or a society where people can only do things that help others. Sofia Lamb does experiments to figure out how to turn her now-teenage daughter, Eleanor, and everyone else in Rapture into the perfect humans. This is so that Rapture can become the perfect society, since Sofia believed a perfect society was not possible unless its people were also perfect. Subject Delta wants to rescue Eleanor before Sofia finishes her experiments. Along the way, Subject Delta gets the help of a businessman named Augustus Sinclair to help find Eleanor. == Gameplay == While the gameplay is very similar to that of BioShock, some new features were added to the sequel. First, the player can use both plasmids (powers gotten from ADAM) and weapons at the same time. In addition, the player has a new weapon called the Hack Tool. This allows the player to hack machines from faraway by shooting Hack Darts at it. Instead of playing a Pipe Dream-like minigame every time the player hacks a machine, the player plays a timing-based minigame that happens as the game is still happening. The player can also use the Hack Tool to drop Mini-turrets. Instead of the wrench, the player's main melee weapon is the Drill. The Drill has a powerful drilling attack that can drain an enemy's health very quickly, but this attack will stop if the player runs out of Drill Fuel. The Drill also has a weaker melee attack that does not use Drill Fuel. Also, if the player chooses to adopt the Little Sisters rather than harvest them, then the player will need to get ADAM by protecting the Little Sisters when they get ADAM from dead Splicers. However, the player can take the time to get resources and set up traps because the player can choose the time when the Little Sister gets ADAM. After the player rescues all the little sisters in a level, the player will then fight a Big Sister, a Little Sister who grew into an adult. Big Sisters are difficult to kill because they have a lot of health, they can kill the player quickly, and they can use plasmids to fight the player. However, the player will get a lot of ADAM if they kill the Big Sister.
