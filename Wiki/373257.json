He was sent to the famous Rugby School in 1784, but was removed in 1791, to avoid expulsion. He then went up to study at Trinity College, Oxford University but was also rusticated from there in 1794. After this, he developed some problems with his father, who was very angry at him, so Landor left his home. ==Poetry and writings== In 1794-95, he prepared his first book of poems, published in 1795 as The Poems of Walter Savage Landor. This was followed by Gebir (1798), Poetry (1802), Imaginary Conversations (series, 1824-1829) and other works. ==Later life and death== He was also for some time married to Julia Thuillier and settled in France for a short time, then moved to Italy.
