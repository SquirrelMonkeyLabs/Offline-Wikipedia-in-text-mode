 "text": "John von Neumann (December 28. 1903 – February 8. 1957) was a Hungarian- American mathematician and physicist. He contributed to many fields, including: *Set theory *Functional analysis *Quantum mechanics *Ergodic theory *Continuous geometry *Economics *Game theory *Computer science *Numerical analysis *Systems theory *Statistics He is generally regarded as a prodigy, polymath and one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century. He was a member of a group called the 'Martians'. They were Hungarian immigrants to the US of extraordinary intellect. Others people in this group were Edward Teller, Paul Erdős, Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner. == Noteworthy work == #His textbook on quantum mechanics is one of the first on this topic. #His game theory is considered one of the most important tools in competitive strategic management and is also of high importance in biosciences. #He is the designer of the Von-Neumann architecture, which is basic to nearly all computers today. #He was one of the first proponents of artificial intelligence. He proposed the idea of self replicating machines. This is why a machine that can replicate itself is now commonly referred to as a 'Von Neumann machine'. #With Stanislav Ulam, he did some of the most important calculations in the Manhattan project. #He worked at the Institute of Advanced Studies the same time as Albert Einstein, Kurt Gödel and Robert Oppenheimer #Well known by computer scientists #Principles are included in every modern computer, tablet or phone. == References == Category:1903 births Category:1957 deaths Category:American mathematicians Category:American physicists Category:Cancer deaths in Washington, D.C.
