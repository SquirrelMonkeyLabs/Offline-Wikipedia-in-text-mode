The Mekong begins in the Lasagongma Spring which is in the plateaus of Tibet, and flows about south-east to the South China Sea. Its watershed covers 307,000 square miles (797,000 square kilometers). Its name comes from the Khmer language \"Mother Ganga\". Me means Mother and Kong means Ganga (Ganges). The Mekong is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world, with hundreds of types of fish, as well as river dolphins, crocodiles, and otters. Fishing is a very important activity on the river.
