 "text": "Bipolar disorder in children, more well known as pediatric bipolar disorder, is a very serious condition that affects children and adolescents. ==Issues== Identifying bipolar disorder for children and teenagers can be difficult as some symptoms are very different from adults. Children and teens often have depressed moods mixed with mania taking place almost every day and sometimes at exactly the same time. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children and adolescents is controversial. This condition often leads to daily functional impairments, and those with bipolar disorder which is prior to 18 years of age are far more likely to commit suicide. ==Pediatric bipolar disorder== Pediatric bipolar disorder is far more acute in children and youth than in adults, with diagnoses at very early age. In children or teenagers, mania often has serious psychotic troubles with mixed mania and depression episodes which are worse and for more erratic times than in adults. Several medications for this condition may have strong side effects for those under 18. Most bipolar children have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ==References== Category:Childhood Category:Controversies",
