 "text": "The Leyte bubble-nest frog (Philautus leitensis) is a type of frog. It lives in the Philippines. It lives in Leyte, Behol, and a few other places. It lives in forests on mountains, not near the ocean. This frog has a pointy nose. The breathing holes are near the end of the nose. They are not near the eyes. There is no webbed skin on the front feet. There is webbed skin on th eback feet. There is brown color on the lower sides of the legs. Like other frogs in Philautus, this frog hatches from eggs as small froglets. It never swims as a tadpole. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
