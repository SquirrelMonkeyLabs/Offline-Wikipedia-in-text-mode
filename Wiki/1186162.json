 "text": "A manhunt is a coordinated and intensive search conducted by law enforcement agencies to locate and apprehend an individual, typically a suspect or fugitive believed to be dangerous or involved in serious criminal activity. Manhunts are launched when a person evades arrest, escapes custody, or is identified as a significant threat to public safety. == Purpose == The primary goal of a manhunt is to capture the target individual as quickly and safely as possible, preventing further harm to the public and bringing the person to justice. Manhunts may be initiated for various reasons, including: * Escaped prisoners * Suspects in violent crimes (e.g., murder, terrorism, armed robbery) * Missing persons under suspicious or criminal circumstances * Individuals considered armed and dangerous == Methods == Law enforcement agencies employ a wide range of techniques and resources during a manhunt, including: * Surveillance footage (CCTV, dash cams) * Canine units (tracking dogs) * Helicopters and drones * Search teams (on foot, in vehicles, or with boats) * Roadblocks and checkpoints * Public alerts (e.g., AMBER Alerts, BOLOs) * Digital tracking (cell phones, social media, credit card usage) Manhunts often involve interagency cooperation, including local police, federal agencies (such as the FBI or Interpol), and sometimes military units, depending on the threat level. == Duration and scale == The duration of a manhunt can vary from a few hours to several years, depending on the circumstances and the fugitive's ability to evade capture. Some manhunts become high-profile cases and receive national or international media coverage. The scale of a manhunt may range from local searches to international pursuits involving extradition efforts. == Notable examples == * 2002 Washington, D.C. sniper attacks – A multi-state manhunt leading to the arrest of two individuals responsible for a series of deadly shootings. * 2013 Boston Marathon bombing – A city-wide lockdown and massive manhunt ending with the death of one suspect and the capture of another. * Ted Kaczynski (\"Unabomber\") – A nationwide manhunt lasting nearly two decades.",
