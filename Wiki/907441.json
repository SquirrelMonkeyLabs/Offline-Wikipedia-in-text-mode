 "text": "Cronobacter is a type of Gram-negative bacteria in the shape of a rod. ==Growth== It can grow using air. But it can also grow on its own if there is no air. They are able to move most of the time, they take away Nitrate from the body, and use Citric acid to live. They use water to break down Arginine (a protein that the body must have to live) and Aesculin, (a sugar which is found in certain foods.) They can take carbon from a chemical compound called \"Ornithine\" and turn it into Carbon Dioxide, which can cause a low amount of Ornithine in the body, causing bad things when peeing. == Dangers and Spreading == Cronobacter entering the body for an adult can happen. Though, Most of the time does not lead to anything bad. In babies though, it can cause very bad things. It can cause Sepsis or cause the areas around the brain and Spinal cord to grow too big which can cause people to die very fast, (Meningitis.) Cronobacter spreads mainly through powder used to make milk. Problems in factories can make an Outbreak happen. == References == *CDC Page on Chronobacter *ScienceDirect Category:Gram-negative bacteria",
