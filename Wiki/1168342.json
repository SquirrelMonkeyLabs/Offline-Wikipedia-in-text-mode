 "text": "Allobates grillicantus is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Home== Scientists have seen this frog in exactly two places, but they think it probably lives in more places between the Tapajós and Xingu Rivers. This frog lives on the dead leaves on the ground in forests that do not fill with water. ==Body== The adult male frog is 15.2–16.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 16.5–17.7 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is tan to red- brown in color. There is a dark brown stripe on each side of the body near the belly and a white stripe on each side of the body near the middle of the back. The front legs are tan-brown and the back legs are gray-brown. The belly is yellow and the throat is light yellow. ==Name== Scientists named this frog grillicantus, which is Latin for \"cricket song,\" because its voice sounds like a cricket singing. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs in a gel nest near fallen leaves. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to puddles or other water. The tadpoles' bodies are longer than they are wide. There is a pattern on the tail. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
