 "text": "Wage slavery is a situation where the pay a person receives for work is so low it barely or doesn't cover their expenses. The worker's wages are used up to pay for their basic needs, and they are unable to earn more. This person then doesn't have any money left to save, or for the expenses of an emergency. Wage slavery is caused when bosses have more power than their employees and pay them very little money. The term \"wage slavery\" is used by Marxists and other people who do not like capitalism. ==References== Category:Capitalism Category:Employment",
