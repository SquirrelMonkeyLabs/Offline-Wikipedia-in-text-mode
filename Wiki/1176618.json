 "text": "This Is It was a planned concert residency by the American pop icon Michael Jackson, intended to take place at the O2 Arena in London, England. The concert series was highly anticipated and was set to feature a series of performances that showcased Jackson's greatest hits, elaborate stage productions, and cutting-edge technology. The residency was announced in March 2009 and was scheduled to run from July 2009 to February 2010, with a total of 50 shows. Unfortunately, Michael Jackson passed away on June 25, 2009, just weeks before the first show was set to begin. His death shocked the world and left fans mourning the loss of the King of Pop. In the aftermath of his passing, the planned concert performances were transformed into a documentary titled Michael Jackson's This Is It, which featured rehearsal footage, behind- the-scenes glimpses, and performances of the songs that were to be featured in the show. The film was released in October 2009 and received positive reviews, with many praising Jackson's enduring talent and charisma. The \"This Is It\" residency remains a significant part of Michael Jackson's legacy, symbolizing both his artistic vision and the profound impact he had on music and entertainment.",
