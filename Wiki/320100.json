People were lured to meet with a decoy under the pretense of sexual contact and then confronted. Show host Chris Hansen clarified in an interview with NPR News that these subjects should be labeled as potential sexual predators, and not pedophiles. \"Pedophiles have a very specific definition, people who are interested in prepubescent sex,\" he stated.\"Ethics of NBC's Sting Show 'To Catch a Predator'\", Talk of the Nation, National Public Radio, January 16, 2007 The series premiered in November 2004, and featured 12 investigations in total held across the United States.
