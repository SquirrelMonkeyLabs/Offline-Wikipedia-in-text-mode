 "text": "A Glasgow smile (also known as a Glasgow grin, Anna grin Cheshire grin or Chelsea smile) is a nickname for the result of cutting a victim's face from the edges of the mouth to the ears. The cut – and the scars it leaves – form an extension of what resembles a smile. Sometimes further to hurt or even kill the victim, they would then be stabbed or kicked, most notably in the stomach (or in case of kicking, the groin), so that the face would be ripped apart when the victim screamed. Mutilation of this kind is commonly inflicted with a utility knife. This method of torture is said to have been started by gangs in Glasgow, Scotland in the 1920s and 30s. ==References== Category:Torture",
