 "text": "In thermodynamics, an isobaric process is a process, where the pressure stays constant. To get an ideal gas to a different temperature, more heat is needed, because some heat will be used to expand the gas. This is different in an isochoric process, where the volume of the gas does not change. Category:Thermodynamics",
