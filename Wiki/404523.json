 "text": "Har Gobind Khorana (Sindhi: هار گوبند خرانه) (also known as Hargobind Khorana; 9 January 1922 – 9 November 2011) was a biochemist. He shared the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Marshall W. Nirenberg and Robert W. Holley. He worked in Madison, Columbia, and Boston. Their work was on the order of nucleotides in nucleic acids. Each triplet of nucleotides codes for a particular amino acid. Therefore the nucleic acid sequence controls how proteins are built. Khorana was the first to build a synthetic gene, in 1970. This helped a lot, with decoding the genetic code, which is based on amino acids. ==Related pages== *List of Indian scientists *List of Nobel Prize winners from India ==References== Category:Biochemists Category:1922 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winners",
