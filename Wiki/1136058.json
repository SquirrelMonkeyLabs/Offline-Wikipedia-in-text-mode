 "text": "LTE (Long-Term Evolution) refers to a class of wireless data transmission technologies used in phones and other mobile devices for fast wireless internet. It is better than older technologies like GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA because it can handle more data and is faster. LTE works differently and has a better network. The phone companies using LTE are the ones that have both a GSM/UMTS and a CDMA2000 network deployed. The phone companies using LTE are the ones that have both a GSM/UMTS and a CDMA2000 network deployed. Because LTE uses different frequencies in different countries, only phones supporting multiple bands can use LTE everywhere. == Terminology == LTE was created by a group called 3GPP. They first described it in a document called Release 8 and made some small improvements in Release 9. LTE is sometimes called 3.95G and is often marketed as 4G LTE or Advanced 4G. The first version of LTE did not completely meet the 4G standards. Later on, ITU-R decided that LTE and similar technologies could be called 4G because they were much better than the older 3G technologies. The LTE Advanced standard formally satisfies the ITU-R requirements for being considered IMT-Advanced. LTE Advanced is a version of LTE that meets all the requirements to be called True 4G. == References == Category:LTE (telecommunication) Category:Wireless networking standards Category:Telecommunications",
