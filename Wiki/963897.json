 "text": "Roxalana \"Roxana\" Druse ( - February 28, 1887), was the last woman hanged in New York. She was the first woman hanged in 40 years in Central New York. Her execution didn't kill her instantly, and New York stopped using the gallows and started using the electric chair instead in 1890. Mrs. Druse murdered her husband, William Druse, in their home in Warren, New York. She killed him by shooting him and decapitating him with an axe. Her son and daughter, George and Mary Druse, and nephew Frank Gates helped her kill her husband. Druse said that she killed her husband because he was abusive to her. She was sentenced to be hanged on February 28, 1887. == Murder of William Druse == On December 18, 1884, William Druse became a missing person. His family was Roxana Druse, his wife, Mary Druse, his 19 year old daughter, George Druse, his 10 year old son, and his 14 year old nephew Frank Gates. Roxana said that she started to argue with William in the morning of the murder. Roxana took a revolver, and Mary put a rope around Williams neck while he was sitting at the breakfast table. Then, Roxana shot at William, but the revolver jammed. She told Frank to come inside, and gave the revolver to him, and told him to kill William or they would kill Frank. He shot William a few times, and Roxana took an axe and decapitated William. She burned the rest of the body in the stove, and she said she would kill George and Frank if they confessed. She threw the ashes of Williams body in a pond, and the revolver and axe. On January 16, 1885, Frank confessed that they killed William. Roxana was arrested, and she also confessed. Druse said that she killed her husband because he was abusive to her. == Hanging == On October 6, 1885 Roxana was sentenced to be hanged on November 25, 1885, but later she was sentenced to be hanged on February 28, 1887. Roxana Druse cried the whole day before she was hanged. Roxana Druse was hanged on February 28, 1887 at 11:48 a.m., and she was pronounced dead at 12:03 p.m. Physicians said that her neck wasn't broken, and she died of strangulation. New York stopped using the gallows 2 years later in 1890, and started using the electric chair. Many people think that Roxana was innocent, and she only confessed so that the murderer didn't get caught. == References == == Other websites == The Notorious Roxana Druce, Part 1 The Notorious Roxana Druce, Part 2 Category:1847 births Category:1887 deaths Category:American people executed for murder Category:People executed by hanging",
