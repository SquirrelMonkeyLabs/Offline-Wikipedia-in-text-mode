 "text": "A telephone box or phone booth is a public kiosk enclosing a payphone. It is usually an item of street furniture, though some may be inside a building. United Kingdom telephone boxes were designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and were common in the UK, Malta and Gibraltar. The colour red was chosen to make them easy to spot. Because of the growth of mobile phones, telephone boxes are steadily being removed. ==Related pages== * Payphone ==References== ==Other websites== * Gallery of UK telephone kiosks * Picture guide to UK telephone boxes * Telephone Box website * Kiosk website * Red telephone kiosks in Oxford, England * Red phone boxes in the Welsh landscape * Existing red phone boxes around the city of Liverpool Category:Street furniture Category:Telephone",
