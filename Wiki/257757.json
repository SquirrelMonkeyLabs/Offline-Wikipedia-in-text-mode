 "text": "\"A Day in the Life\" is a song by the English rock group The Beatles. It is the last song on the group's 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It is a very famous song. ==Inspiration== Many people think that the first verse was written about the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune and close friend of Lennon and McCartney, who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 when a Volkswagen pulled out of a side street into his path in Redcliffe Gardens, Earls Court. In many interviews, Lennon said this was the verse's main inspiration. However, George Martin thinks that it is a drug reference (as is the line \"I'd love to turn you on\" and other passages from the song) and while writing the lyrics Lennon and McCartney were imagining a stoned politician who had stopped at a set of traffic lights. The description of the accident in \"A Day in the Life\" was not a literal description of Browne's fatal accident. Lennon said, \"I didn't copy the accident. Tara didn't blow his mind out, but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song — not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene — were similarly part of the fiction.\" The final verse was inspired by an article in the Daily Mail in January 1967 regarding a substantial number of potholes in Blackburn, a town in Lancashire. However, he had a problem with the words of the final verse, not being able to think of how to connect \"Now they know how many holes it takes to\" and \"the Albert Hall\". His friend Terry Doran suggested that they would \"fill\" the Albert Hall. ==Personnel== * John Lennon – lead vocals, acoustic guitar, maracas, piano (final chord) * Paul McCartney – piano, lead vocals, bass guitar * George Harrison – maracas * Ringo Starr – drums, congas, piano (final chord) * George Martin – harmonium (final chord) and producer * Mal Evans – alarm clock, counting, piano (final chord) * Geoff Emerick – engineering and mixing * Orchestrated by George Martin, John Lennon and Paul McCartney * Conducted by George Martin and Paul McCartney * John Marston – harp * Erich Gruenberg, Granville Jones, Bill Monro, Jurgen Hess, Hans Geiger, D.
