 "text": "Bedales School is a co-educational private school. It is a boarding and day school in the village of Steep, near the market town of Petersfield in Hampshire, England. It was founded in 1893 by Amy Badley and John Haden Badley as an alternative to usual Victorian schools. It has been co-educational since 1898. Bedales takes young people from 13 to 18, so it is a secondary school. The enrolment is 761 at present. The school has never had a chapel: its relatively secular teaching made it attractive to non-conformists, agnostics, Quakers, Unitarians and liberal Jews, who were among its early intake.
