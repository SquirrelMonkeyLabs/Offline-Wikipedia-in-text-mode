 "text": "All In (2023) (also known as All In London) was a professional wrestling pay- per-view show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on August 27, 2023 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. It was AEW's first PPV held outside of North America. The show was the first All In event held by AEW and the successor to the All In event that was held in 2018 by an independent company. It also was the first professional wrestling event to take place at Wembley since the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) held SummerSlam at the original stadium in 1992. With 81,035 people, All In beat WrestleMania 32 to become the highest paid attendance for a professional wrestling event. The main event saw MJF defeat Adam Cole and keep his AEW World Championship. The match first ended after MJF and Cole hit each other with a double clothesline and landed on each other which the ref counted for 3. Cole and MJF demanded the match be restarted. MJF pinned Cole after a run in distraction from Roderick Strong. The event was also notable for a backstage fight between AEW performers CM Punk and Jack Perry (son of late actor Luke Perry) that led to Punk's firing several days later. The fight came nearly a year after Punk was involved in a similar incident involving three other AEW performers: Kenny Omega, Matt Jackson, and Nick Jackson (the latter two collectively known as The Young Bucks). ==Matches== No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Better Than You BayBay (MJF and Adam Cole) defeated Aussie Open (Kyle Fletcher and Mark Davis) (c) Tag team match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship 7:45 2 Hook defeated Jack Perry (c) FTW Rules match for the FTW Championship 8:20 3 CM Punk (c) defeated Samoa Joe Singles match for the \"Real World Championship\" 14:00 4 Bullet Club Gold (Juice Robinson and Jay White) and Konosuke Takeshita (with Don Callis, Austin Gunn, and Colten Gunn) defeated The Golden Elite (Kenny Omega, Kota Ibushi, and \"Hangman\" Adam Page) Trios match 20:30 5 FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) (c) defeated The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) Tag team match for the AEW World Tag Team Championship 21:45 6 Eddie Kingston, Penta El Zero Miedo, Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent Beretta), and Orange Cassidy (with Alex Abrahantes) defeated Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli, and Wheeler Yuta), Mike Santana, and Ortiz Stadium Stampede match 21:30 7 Saraya defeated Toni Storm, Hikaru Shida (c), and Dr. Britt Baker, D.M.D. Four-way match for the AEW Women's World Championship 8:50 8 Darby Allin and Sting defeated Swerve Strickland and Christian Cage (with Prince Nana) Coffin match 16:00 9 Will Ospreay (with Don Callis) defeated Chris Jericho (with Sammy Guevara) Singles match 14:55 10 Billy Gunn and The Acclaimed (Anthony Bowens and Max Caster) defeated The House of Black (Malakai Black, Brody King, and Buddy Matthews) (c) (with Julia Hart) House Rules No Holds Barred trios match for the AEW World Trios Championship 10:50 11 MJF (c) defeated Adam Cole Singles match for the AEW World Championship 29:00 ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:2023 in sports Category:2023 in England Category:All Elite Wrestling shows Category:Sport in London",
