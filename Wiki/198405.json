 "text": "Esporte Clube Vitória, usually known simply as Vitória, is a Brazilian football team from Salvador in Bahia, founded on May 13, 1899. The team plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B and the Campeonato Baiano. == History == The club was founded on May 13, 1899, by the brothers Artur and Artêmio Valente, along with seventeen other young fellows. On the start, the Vitória was a cricket club, named Club de Cricket Victoria, because all of them lived at the Vitória neighborhood, in Salvador. In 1902, Victory started to have football as a sport, as well as athletics, swimming and rowing. Still in that year, the club changed its name to Sport Club Victória, as cricket was no longer the only sport practiced, and changed its colors to red and black at the suggestion of Mr. Cesar Godinho Spínola, who came from Rio de Janeiro, who proposed creation of the nautical section in the club. == References == Category:Brazilian football clubs Category:Salvador, Bahia Category:1899 establishments Category:1890s establishments in Brazil",
