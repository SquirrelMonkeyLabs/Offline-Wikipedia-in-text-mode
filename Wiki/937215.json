 "text": "Tengrism is a shamanistic indigenous pagan religion of the Turkic peoples. ==Deity== The highest deity of the religion is Khan Tengri (Sky God). Because of the importance of this deity, the religion has the features of monotheism. There are also parts of the religion that are polytheistic and animistic. ==Relation with shamanism== The relationship to Shamanism is the subject of controversy. According to some, the Tengrist cult of heaven and shamanism are two different traditions. According to others, this cult existed as a part of shamanism. There is no male circumcision in Tengrism. Parents who become believers in Modern Tengrisim do not circumcise their male children. ==Today== Modern Tengrism started at the time of the end of the Soviet Union in the intellectual circles of the Turkish peoples in Central Asia. It is most common with the Tatars, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people. A return to the surviving traditions is also taking place in Yakutia and Tuva. Similar movements also exists in Turkey. ==References== Category:paganism Category:Turkish culture",
