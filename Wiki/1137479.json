 "text": "The pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) is a sturgeon from the genus Scaphirhynchus. This sturgeon is found in the Missouri River and lower Mississippi River basins. It is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN probably due to a few individuals in the wild. There have been conservation efforts to save the sturgeon from going completely extinct. == Etymology == The word pallid means \"being pale in color\", much like in humans. The species name albus means \"white\" in Latin. == Description == === Characteristics === Pallid sturgeons can typically reach 30 and 60 inches (76 and 152 cm) long. They have a heterocercal tail. They're usually called \"dinosaur-like\" or \"hideous\". Just like most sturgeons, they have a series of plates called scutes. They do not have bony skeletons, but they do have a cartilaginous skeleton. This soft tissue can even spread out to the dorsal fin to the tail. They are sometimes confused with the shovelnose sturgeon. === DNA studies === Scientists conducted DNA analysis on these sturgeons to know the differences between pallid and shovelnose. == Ecology == === Habitat === The pallid sturgeon lives in the Missouri River and prefers wider river channels. === Depths === These sturgeons can stay between 3 and 25 ft deep. However, a study showed that the pallid sturgeon was recorded to stay between 2 and 47 ft deep. == Related pages == * Shovelnose sturgeon * Beluga (sturgeon) * Lake sturgeon * Dabry's sturgeon * Acipenseriformes == References == # Jordan, G.; Nelson- Stastny, W.
