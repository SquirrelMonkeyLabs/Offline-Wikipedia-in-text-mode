 "text": "The 2018 Washington Veterans Day Parade (also called \"Trump's military parade\") was a planned military parade. It would have been in Washington, D.C., on November 10, 2018. It was in honor of Veterans Day in America. On August 16, 2018, the military announced that the parade would be in 2019 instead. The President Donald Trump said the parade was cancelled because of the high costs. He blamed the high costs on Washington D.C. city officials. == Cost == In early 2018, a person that worked in the Pentagon said that the parade would cost from $3 million to $50 million. Another source said the cost would be $92 million. However, the Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said $92 was not the cost of the parade. In a report, he said \"I'm not dignifying that number ($92 million) with a reply.\" Washington D.C. officials said the cost of the parade would be $21.6 million. The Mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser said that $13 million would pay for police costs. ==References== Category:2010s in military history Category:Donald Trump Category:November 2018 events Category:2018 in the United States Category:Parades in the United States",
