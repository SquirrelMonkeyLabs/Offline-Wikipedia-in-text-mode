Each glyph (individual character) in text has a shape we recognize in reading. The complete set of letters and symbols in a design is called a font (or fount). The choice of font is therefore the first thing which affects legibility. A second factor in legibility is the setting, the way the type is used in practice. This includes line length, line spacing (\"leading\"), justification, typestyle, kerning, tracking, point size, etc.Williamson, Hugh 1956. Methods of book design: the practice of an industrial craft.
