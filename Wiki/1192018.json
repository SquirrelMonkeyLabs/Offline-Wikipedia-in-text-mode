 "text": "Tatar (; 1388 – 12 June 1635) was a word that was used by the Han Chinese. The word meant the nomadic people in Mongolia. During the Ming dynasty, the word \"Tatar\" described the Eastern Mongols. In the early 15th century, there were 2 major Mongolian tribes. These groups were the Eastern and Western Mongolian Tribes. The eastern Mongolian grasslands had tribes that were ruled by the Northern Yuan court. These tribes were nomadic. They lived in the northern and southern Gobi Desert. The Ming dynasty called them the \"Tatars.\" The Oirats lived in the western Mongolian grasslands. The Western Mongolian grasslands were northwest of the Mongolian Plateau. The descendents of the Kublai Khan ruled the \"Tatars\". Their descendents were called the Black Tatars. The Tatars called themselves The Forty [tümen] Mongols (; Mongolian script: ; Döchin Mongol). == References == Category:1380s establishments Category:14th-century establishments in Asia Category:1630s disestablishments Category:17th-century disestablishments in Asia Category:History of Mongolia Category:Former countries in Asia",
