The XR is the most budget-friendly of the iPhones released in 2018 and is available in white, coral, yellow, blue, space gray, and PRODUCT(RED) color options, with 64, 128, or 256 GB storage options. The iPhone X has a 6.1â€³ LCD screen and sells starting at US $749. The X, along with the X and X Max, are the first iPhones to not ship with a Lightning-to-3.5 mm audio adapter. Lightning-to-3.5 mm audio adapters can only be bought separately. Like the iPhone X before it, the X contains no home button, with a notch on the front that holds the front camera in place.
