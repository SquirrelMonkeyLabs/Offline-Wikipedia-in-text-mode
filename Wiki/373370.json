 "text": "Dobermann or Doberman Pinscher is a medium to large dog breed. It originated in Germany about 1890. It was named after a tax collector, Friedrich Louis Doberman (1834-1894), who wanted a dog as a companion and for protection. Doberman Pinschers are known as being very intelligent, loyal and fearless dogs. They are used by police forces, search and rescue dogs, guard dogs and as guide dogs for blind people. == Description == === Size === The Doberman is a dog of medium large size. Although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, according to the FCI standard the dog typically stands between and The Kennel Club in the UK quote as being ideal. The female is typically somewhere between . A height of is considered ideal. === Colors === Dobermans have short smooth coats which are most commonly black.Julie Fiedler, Doberman Pinschers (New York: PowerKids Press, 2006), p. 6 Less common are red (reddish-brown), blue, or fawn-colored coats. Blue and fawn colored Dobermans usually have rust-colored (reddish-brown) markings on their legs, chest and heads.Charlotte Wilcox, The Doberman Pinscher (Mankato, MN: Capstone Press, 1998), p. 5 === Ears and tail === Normally a Doberman puppy has floppy ears and a long tail. While still a puppy, the tails are often shortened by surgery (called \"docking\") which heals quickly and causes the puppy very little pain.Raymond Gudas; Betsy Sikora Siino; Michele Earle-Bridges, Doberman Pinschers: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Training and Behavior (Hauppauge, NY: Barron's, 2005), p. 19 The ears are cut to a point and so they stand up (called \"cropping\"). This takes longer to heal. Cropping is considered by many to be unnecessary and is illegal in much of Europe. But it is still done in the United States and is part of the standard. == Temperament == People who think they are like any other dogs or are often vicious and dangerous are for the most part wrong. It is true that any dog that is mistreated or not taken care of can become dangerous. Viciousness is a learned behavior and few dogs, including the Doberman, are naturally vicious. Dobermans can be protective and guarded or they can be sweet and eager to please. To get the desired temperament, training should start when the dog is about 8 months old. == Bite force == A Doberman bite force is between 245 and 305 pounds per square inch (PSI), which is much stronger than the average dog's bite force of 150 to 200 PSI: * Bite force: A Doberman's bite force is strong enough to break human bones. * Bite type: Dobermans have a \"scissor bite\" where their upper and lower teeth align closely, creating a slicing action. * Attack style: Dobermans often attack in quick succession over a broad area. * Injuries: Doberman bites can cause deep cuts and injuries that may require medical attention.
