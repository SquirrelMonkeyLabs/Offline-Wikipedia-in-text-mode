 "text": "Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR (born 17 December 1942) was the President of Nigeria and a former Major General in the Nigerian Army. He first became Head of State of Nigeria on 31 December 1983 when he took over the government by surprise. While he was in power, he passed laws to control how people behaved that were very harsh and put many people in jail, even the famous musician Fela Kuti. On 27 August 1985, there was another surprise takeover and he was no longer in charge of the country. In the 21st century, Buhari decided to try and become head of state again and ran in multiple elections. He eventually won and became President of Nigeria in 2015. He brought back some of the harsh laws from the last time he was in charge of Nigeria. Now, more people have been criticizing him as part of the End SARS protests. == Related pages == * List of Nigerians ==References== ==Other websites== * * 2011 Presidential Election Campaign website * Muhammadu Buhari - In a HARDtalk interview on 21 January 2004 Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Nigerian generals Category:Presidents of Nigeria",
