It features rapper Jay-Z and production by Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, utilizing the bass, hi-hat, and the 808 instruments and sound system, reminiscent of many popular Rich Harrison productions. Released as the album's lead single in the third quarter of 2006, \"Déjà Vu\" reached number one in Brazil, China, Poland, and the United Kingdom.
