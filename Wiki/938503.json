 "text": "Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure sores, bed sores or pressure injuries, are damage to the skin and/or tissue that happen over a bone caused by a lot of pressure on it. This is usually caused by sitting or laying in bed for a long time. The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, coccyx, heels, and hips. Other places can also be affected, such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium. ==References== Category:Medical emergencies",
