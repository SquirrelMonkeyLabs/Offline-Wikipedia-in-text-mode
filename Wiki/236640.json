 "text": "Jacobitism was (and, to a much smaller extent, is) the political movement that tried to put the Stuarts back onto the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland. It took its name from the Latin form Jacobus of the name of King James II and VII. Jacobitism began after James II and VII was deposed in 1688. He was replaced by his daughter Mary II jointly with her husband, William of Orange, who was also her first cousin. The Stuarts lived on the European Continent and sometimes tried to get back the throne with the help of France or Spain. The most important places of Jacobitism were Ireland and Scotland, especially the Scottish Highlands. In England, Jacobitism was strongest in the North. There was some support also in Wales. Many Catholics supported Jacobitism and hoped the Stuarts to end the laws against them. Many others helped Jacobite military campaigns for all sorts of reasons such as in the hope of improve their fortunes. In Scotland, the Jacobite cause became a lasting romantic memory. == Further reading == *Ruvigny & Raineval, Marquis de (Melville Henry Massue) (comp.).
