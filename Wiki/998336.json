 "text": "Interstate 87 (I-87) is an Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The highway's south end is at I-40, I-440, and U.S. Route 64 (US 64) in Raleigh. Its north end is at US 64 and US 264 in Wendell. The highway is long. While a north-south highway, it will run more east-west. In the future, I-87 will possibly go from Raleigh to Norfolk, Virginia. ==History== I-87 started as I-495 on February 20, 2013. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) asked the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to sign the interstate as I-495 as an auxiliary route of I-95. I-495 would have been long. The highway had an east end at I-440 and US 64 in Raleigh, and would have had a west end at I-95 in Rocky Mount. On March 15, 2013, NCDOT asked AASHTO to make I-495 from I-440 to I-540, which is long, and Future I-495 from I-540 to I-95, which is long. On May 23, 2017, AASHTO allowed NCDOT to remove I-495 and Future I-495. They were replaced by I-87 and Future I-87. ==References== 87 Category:Roads in North Carolina",
