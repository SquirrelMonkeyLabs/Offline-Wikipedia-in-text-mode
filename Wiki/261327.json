The terms, with variations, are used for all kinds of Christian churches. == Horizontal layout == *Nave, where the congregation sits. **Aisles round the edges. The aisles may be quite grand, major features of the cathedral. *The transept makes the cross shape. **The crossing is where the transept crosses the nave. *The quire (choir) is the area between the nave and the 'sacred' area (the presbytery and sanctuary). The quire is separated from the nave by a 'rood screen'. It often has choir stalls where members of the choir sit. *Liturgical east end: **The presbytery is where the priest(s) conduct liturgy, such as Mass. **The sanctuary, not pictured here, is where the altar is. **The ambulatory (from the Latin 'to walk'), space for walking, with radiating chapels around the outer wall of the ambulatory. == Other terms == *Altar: any structure where offerings are made for religious purposes. *Apse: round (hemi- spherical) part at east end of church. *Chancel: space around the altar *Lancet window: tall, thin window, often pointed at top. *Reredos: decorated screen behind altar *Rood screen or chancel screen: decorated screen which divides the chancel from the nave.
