The term is used to contrast with offices at nation-state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government.\"State & Local Government\" at WhiteHouse.gove ; retrieved 2013-4-24. What a local government does changes depending on what country it is in, and even when they are similar what it is called often varies. Common names for local governments include state, province, région, départment, county, prefecture, district, city, township, town, borough, parish, municipality, shire and village.
