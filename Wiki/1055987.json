 "text": "Snake is a type of action video game where the player controls a growing line that looks like a snake. The goal is to avoid hitting obstacles and the snake's own body as it gets longer. This game originated in 1976 as a two- player arcade game called Blockade. The objective was to survive longer than the other player. Later, a single-player version was created where the snake grows longer by eating food like apples or eggs. Snake games are popular because they are simple and don't require advanced technology. There are many versions of snake games available for different platforms, some with \"snake\" or \"worm\" in the title. The popularity of snake games increased when a version called Snake was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, reaching a larger audience.
