 "text": "Kiwi Farms, formerly known as CWCki Forums, is an American Internet forum for discussion and harassment about online people and communities it deems \"lolcows\"—people who can be “milked for laughs”. The site has been part of many controversies like hosting the video of the Christchurch mosque shootings and for being linked to three suicides. ==History== The site launched with the name CWCki Forums in 2013, as a place to troll and harass Christine Weston Chandler, known as “Chris Chan”, a webcomic artist first noticed in 2007 on the Something Awful forums. The name was based off of her initials. The site's new name, Kiwi Farms, was coined in 2014. It now hosts threads targeting many individuals, including minorities, women, LGBT people, neurodivergent people, people considered by Kiwi Farms users to be mentally ill or sexually deviant, feminists, journalists, internet celebrities and video game or comics hobbyists. In 2022, Cloudflare removed it from their DDoS protection due to an online campaign started by one of the site's victims. The site came back online after it switched to other DDoS protection providers, though various internet service providers blocked access to it. After switching to another internet service provider, it has been able to come back online. The site has since been sporadically online. == Related pages == * 4chan * Reddit * Something Awful == References == Category:American websites Category:Internet culture",
