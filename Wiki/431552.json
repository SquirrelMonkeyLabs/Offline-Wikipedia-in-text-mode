 "text": "John Peter Wilkinson (12 July 1947 – 21 November 2022), is an English singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is best known for his time with the pub rock band Dr. Feelgood. He is said to be one of the founding influences of the English punk movement. Johnson was featured in the first and second seasons of the HBO series Game of Thrones. He played a mute executioner named Ilyn Payne. In January 2013, he was diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer. He chose not to receive any chemotherapy. He said in an interview with John Wilson on the BBC Radio 4 programme Front Row that the doctors told him he only had nine or ten months to live. He also said during the interview that he was going to do a \"farewell tour\" of the UK set for March. When he finished his tour, he announced that he was going to spend his final days recording a farewell album with Roger Daltrey, lead singer of The Who. In October 2014, Johnson announced he was cancer free. Johnson died on 21 November 2022, at his home in Westcliff-on-Sea, at the age of 75. Following the announcement of Johnson's death, Billy Bragg said, \"His guitar playing was angry and angular, but his presence – twitchy, confrontational, out of control – was something we'd never beheld before in UK pop. Rotten, Strummer and Weller learned a lot from his edgy demeanour.\" Alex Kapranos, lead singer of Franz Ferdinand said, \"His unique, wired playing & stage presence thrilled & inspired many guitarists, myself included.\" Broadcaster Bob Harris said \"Wilko was absolutely unique. His energy and spirit were incredible.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1947 births Category:2022 deaths Category:English rock guitarists Category:English singer-songwriters Category:Musicians from Essex",
