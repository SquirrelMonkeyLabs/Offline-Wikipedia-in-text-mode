 "text": "Hurricane Lili was the strongest hurricane during the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season in terms of winds. However, Hurricane Isidore was actually stronger in terms of barometric pressure. Lili had winds of 145 miles an hour at her peak. Thirteen people were killed because of this hurricane over the Caribbean islands. The storm hit Louisiana as a Category One hurricane with winds between 90 and 100 miles an hour. There were no direct deaths in the United States, though two indirect deaths did happen due to Lili. Property damage totaled between $750 million and $1.5 billion, making Lili the costliest of the season. The name Lili was later retired and replaced by Laura.
