 "text": "The Siamese revolution of 1932 (), also known as the Siamese coup d'Ã©tat of 1932 (), was a takeover by the People's Party (Khana Ratsadon) in Siam on 24 June 1932. It ended the centuries-long absolute monarchy under the Chakri dynasty. The revolution was bloodless and led to Siam becoming a constitutional monarchy, introducing democracy, the first constitution, and creating the National Assembly. The revolution was driven by dissatisfaction due to the economic crisis, poor government performance, and the rise of Western-educated commoners. King Prajadhipok stayed on the throne and reached a compromise with the People's Party. However, there were two more coups in the following year, in April and June, due to disagreements within the government over Pridi Banomyong's socialist economic plan and a royalist rebellion. category:20th century in Thailand category:Revolutions",
