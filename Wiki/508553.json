The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 by the leading British scientists of the age, including Henry Cavendish. Its purpose was to: :\"diffuse the knowledge, and facilitate the general introduction, of useful mechanical inventions and improvements; and for teaching, by courses of philosophical lectures and experiments, the application of science to the common purposes of life\". Directors of the R.I. have included some of the greatest scientists, including Humphrey Davy, Michael Faraday, Sir William Henry Bragg and Sir William Lawrence Bragg, Max Perutz and John Kendrew. Fifteen Directors have won Nobel Prizes. ==Greenfield controversy== From 1998 to 8 January 2010, the Director of the Royal Institution was Baroness Susan Greenfield, but following a review, the position was abolished for being \"no longer affordable\". The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a £22m development programme led by Greenfield, which included refurbishment of the institution's main Albemarle Street building, and the addition of a restaurant and bar with an aim to turn the venue into a \"Groucho club for science\". The project ended £3 million in debt.Gammell, Caroline; Alleyne, Richard (12 January 2010). \"Baroness Greenfield's redundancy 'only way to get rid of her'\". The Daily Telegraph (London). Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be suing for discrimination.
