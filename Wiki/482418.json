On the Billboard charts, Here Without You was able to peak at #5 on the Hot 100 chart. Lead singer Brad Arnold said that his inspiration for this song was his now ex-wife. Arnold said \"The song's about being away from someone, or missing them. And it really doesn't matter if you're here without them for all day or all month. It's about the loneliness and missing of somebody\". The song was used by the WWE in a tribute video to professional wrestler Eddie Guerrero after he died from a heart attack in November 2005. ==References== ==Other websites== *\"Here Without You\" on YouTube * Category:2003 songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Rock ballads",
