 "text": "The Holy See reported the first case of infection in Vatican City during the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of March 2020. Unlike other countries that report cases within a given territory or cases of residents or citizens of a territory, the Holy See reports on cases \"in Vatican City State and among the employees of the Holy See\" regardless of location of testing, treatment, or residence. There are 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the Vatican's residents and employees; there are no associated deaths. The 12 cases include 10 employees, 1 new hire, and 1 resident of Vatican City. At the very end of February, Pope Francis became ill with symptoms of a cold, but he tested negative for COVID-19. ==References== Category:History of Vatican City Vatican",
