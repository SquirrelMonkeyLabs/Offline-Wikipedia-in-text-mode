They were left with Scrooge when Donald went off to join the Navy. Scrooge is the richest duck in the world. He has no want for anything. This does not stop him from finding ways to try to get more money. Other common plots deal with him protecting his wealth from villains. In general, there were several different plotlines that were used many times in many of the episodes. Some of these plotlines included: * Scrooge learns about an ancient treasure or civilization. When he goes to find it, he finds more trouble than he thought he would find. (Home Sweet Homer, Master of the Djinni, Sweet Duck of Youth, A Ducktale's Valentine) * In a similar plot, Scrooge is having trouble with one of his businesses. When he goes to fix the problem, he gets involved in an adventure of some sort. (Where No Duck Has Gone Before, Bermuda Triangle Tangle, Ducks of the West, Back Out in the Outback) * Gyro creates a new invention. The invention usually either causes problems when it does not work properly or it is stolen and used for evil. (Armstrong, Bubba's Big Brainstorm, Time Teasers) * Scrooge loses all of his money, often to the Beagle Boys, and tries to get it back. This plotline is often used with one of the other common plotlines. (The Money Vanishes, Scrooge's Last Adventure, Time is Money) * Flintheart Glomgold tries to become better than Scrooge. This usually deals with Glomgold trying to become the richest duck in the world. (Duckman of Aquatraz, The Uncrashable Hindentanic, The Attack of the Metal Mites) * Magica de Spell tries to steal the first money that Scrooge ever earned. This is his first dime, which he calls his \"Number One Dime\". Her plans involve using the special dime to create a magic spell that will give her great wealth. (Send in the Clones, Nothing to Fear, Magica's Shadow War). * Scrooge remembers some business, voyages or adventures from when he was young. (Ducktales:Treasure of the Golden Suns, Duck in the Iron Mask, Status Seeker, Launchpad's First Crash, Once Upon a Dime, The Curse of Castle McDuck, Back to the Klondike, Super DuckTales). ==Characters== ===Heroes=== * Scrooge McDuck is the richest duck in the world.

But Schewebazade, the Sultan's young wife, saves them and they escape from the palace. The guards follow them and Glomgold go for his count. Meanwhile, the nephews and Webby, who witnessed the evil act of the djinni, put the djinni back in the lamp and let him leave only when he agrees to bring Scrooge back from the past.

At the island, Glomgold wishes that the lamp was never found in the first place. This puts everything back in time to when the ducks open the vault entrance. The explosion made the lamp fall and despite the ducks can back to Duckburg alive, the lamp stays in the vault as never found. ===Sweet Duck of Youth=== One night, Scrooge McDuck and Launchpad go back to Manor McDuck.

There he finds a book that talks about \"Ponce de Loon\", a Spanish explorer who said he found the fountain of youth in Florida. The next day, in Florida, the ducks are in a tropical forest when they meet an old man who is also trying to find the fountain of youth. After finding a map, the guys find the Fountain of Youth.
