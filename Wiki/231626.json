 "text": "Skeletons is the fourth studio album by American rock band, Hawthorne Heights. It is their first and only studio album through Wind-up Records. The release date for the album was June 1, 2010. The album has 13 tracks.http://www.hawthorneheights.com/ on Feb 5 2010 The album is produced by Howard Benson. The first song released as a single from the album is \"Nervous Breakdown\". ==2009 Never Sleep Again tour== Because the band member who did the harsh vocals for the band died, the album before this one, Fragile Future, didn't have any death growls in it. During the 2009 tour, though, one of the other band members started using these vocals for the band, so this album has them again. Other music groups like Just Surrender, Monty Are I, Punchline, and Anarbor went on the tour too. During the tour the band played a song called \"End of the Underground\" and passed out download cards for the song \"Unforgivable\". These were the first two songs anyone heard from the new album. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2010 albums Category:Hawthorne Heights albums",
