 "text": "Littlejohn's tree frog or heath frog (Litoria littlejohni) is a frog from Australia. It lives in New South Wales and Victoria. It lives in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The adult male frog is 40 to 51 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 52 to 68 mm. This frog is light brown with darker marks and a dark band down its back and dark stripes from its nose to its armpits. It has a lighter belly. It has orange colouring where its legs meet its body. This frog lives in forests. It hides in plants and under dead leaves. This frog lays eggs in streams and swamps. The tadpoles live in slow-moving pools with sunlight. This frog is in danger in New South Wales because human beings change their forests and streams, because of climate change and because introduced species of fish eat their eggs. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
