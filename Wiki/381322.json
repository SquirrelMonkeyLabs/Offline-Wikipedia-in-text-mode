 "text": "The Secret Meeting is an oil painting by Jean-Honoré Fragonard. It dates to 1771-1773. Fragonard was hired to paint a series of four panels for the chateau at Louveciennes, the home of Madame du Barry, the last of Louis XV's mistresses. His theme was \"The Progress of Love\". It is the companion piece to The Lover Crowned. It hangs in the Frick Museum, New York. Fragonard was drawn to the playful lives of his contemporary aristocratic youth, a notable aspect of Rococo decorative painting. In this painting, a young man has scaled the wall surround his sweetheart's family estate. The young woman, having agreed to the private rendezvous, looks around anxiously to be sure she hasn't been followed. == References == * Category:1770s paintings Category:Paintings by Jean-Honoré Fragonard",
