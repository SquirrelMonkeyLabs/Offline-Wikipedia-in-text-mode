 "text": "Gone with the Wind is a 1936 novel by Margaret Mitchell. It tells the story of a family woman in the American South (and in the plantation of Tara) during the Civil War. She falls in love with a city gentleman. It is one of the most famous books of its time, and was made into a movie of the same name. The title takes the name from the line of Ernest Dowson's poem: \"I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind.\" (The line appeared in the book). Critics and historians have disagreed with its views of Confederacy and the American South before the Civil War. But it is true to the events of the time, and also has a well-written account of the fall of Atlanta in 1864. The book won the Pulitzer Prize on May 3, 1937. In 1991, Alexander Ripley wrote its official sequel, Scarlett. Three years later, it was made as a television miniseries. In 2001, the copyright holders of the original book tried to stop sales of Alice Randall's The Wind Done Gone. (The book retold Mitchell's story from a slave's point of view.) The resulting lawsuit allowed the book to be published; it was seen, based on rules in the First Amendment, as a parody. ==Related pages== *Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century == Other websites == * The Story behind Margaret Mitchell's book * * RaveCentral: Gone with the Wind * Greatest Movies page * * Photos of the first edition of Gone with the Wind Category:1936 books Category:20th-century American novels Category:Fiction set in the past Category:Georgia (U.S. state) in fiction Category:Novels about the American Civil War Category:Pulitzer Prize winners Category:Romance novels Category:Books about slavery in America",
