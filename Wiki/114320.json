 "text": "The waveform is the shape of a wave as it travels. There are many different waveforms. They are usually a shape which is repeated over and over (a \"periodic waveform\"). A common waveform is the sine wave. It is normally not possible to see a waveform without some device. == Root mean square == The amplitude of a waveform may change a lot. Even though it changes, the waveform has a root mean square (rms) value. For example: in the UK, the AC mains supply is a sine wave and has a voltage of 240 V. This is an rms voltage. The actual voltage varies: :V_{\\text{peak}} = \\sqrt 2 \\times V_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt 2 \\times 240 = \\pm 339.411255\\dots V The amplitude of the sine wave keeps changing from -339.4 V to +339.4 V. Root mean square is important. It lets us work out many useful things, like power and heating in a wire. This table has information about working out the rms for some waveforms. Wave type rms amplitude Sine wave A_{\\text{rms}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sqrt 2} Square wave A_{\\text{rms}} = A_{\\text{peak}} Triangular wave A_{\\text{rms}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sqrt 3} Category:Wave physics",
