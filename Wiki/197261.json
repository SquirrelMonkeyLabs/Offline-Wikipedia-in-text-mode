The movie stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson. ==Plot== In Birmingham, Alabama, a woman called Evelyn goes to a nursing home to visit her mother-in-law and meets an elderly woman called Ninny. They become friends. Ninny tells Evelyn stories about when she was younger, and about the people she used to know. In particular, she tells Evelyn about two young women, Idgie and Ruth. In Ninny's stories, Idgie and Ruth are friends who run a caf√© together and raise Ruth's son Buddy. Ruth has separated from her husband Frank because he used to hit her. One day, Frank goes missing and the police begin to think that Idgie has killed him. Ninny tells Evelyn her stories over several visits. During that time, Evelyn, who was depressed, is inspired by Ruth and Idgie to have more power in her life. In the end, Ninny goes to live with Evelyn and her husband. There is a hint that Ninny and Idgie might be the same person. ==Cast== * Kathy Bates as Evelyn Couch * Mary Stuart Masterson as Idgie Threadgoode * Mary-Louise Parker as Ruth Jamison * Jessica Tandy as Ninny Threadgoode * Cicely Tyson as Sipsey * Chris O'Donnell as Buddy Threadgoode * Stan Shaw as Big George * Gailard Sartain as Ed Couch * Timothy Scott as Smokey Lonesome * Gary Basaraba as Grady Kilgore * Lois Smith as Mama Threadgoode * Danny Nelson as Papa Threadgoode ==Differences from the novel== There are some differences between the movie and the novel it was made from. In the novel, Idgie and Ruth are a lesbian couple. In the movie they may be just friends. The director, John Avnet said that he wanted viewers to make up their own minds. In one part of the movie, Idgie and Ruth have a food fight. Avnet said that the food fight is symbolic of love-making.DVD commentary When it was released, some critics and LGBT activists were angry that the lesbian part of the story had been \"glossed over\". Even though the lesbian content had been hidden, the movie won an award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for best feature movie with lesbian content. Another difference is that at the end of the movie, it seems possible that Ninny is really Idgie. In the novel, they are completely separate characters and are sisters-in-law. ==Reception== The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards and two BAFTA awards. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1991 drama movies Category:1990s LGBT movies Category:American drama movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:Birmingham, Alabama Category:English-language movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies set in Alabama Category:Movies set in the 1920s Category:Movies set in the 1980s Category:Universal Pictures movies Category:Movies directed by Jon Avnet",
