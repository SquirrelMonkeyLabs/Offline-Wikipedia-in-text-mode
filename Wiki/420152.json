 "text": "Until 2015, Nepal was divided into 14 administrative zones (anchal) and 77 districts (jillā). The 14 administrative zones were grouped into five development regions. In 1962, Nepal reorganized into 14 administrative zones but, around 1995, zones fell into disuse, so the already existing development regions effectively became the primary subdivisions. The administrative zones, by development regions and from east to west, were the following: Region Zone Name for Chief city Population (2011) Area (km²) Districts Eastern Mechi Mechi River Ilam 1,422,182 8,196 4 Kosi Kosi River Biratnagar 2,335,047 9,669 6 Sagarmatha Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) Rajbiraj 2,054,326 10,591 6 Central Janakpur Its capital Janakpurdham 2,837,481 9,669 6 Bagmati Bagmati River Kathmandu 3,843,596 9,428 8 Narayani Narayani (lower Gandaki) river Birganj 2,975,908 8,313 5 Western Gandaki Gandaki River Pokhara 1,549,857 12,275 6 Lumbini Lumbini, a pilgrimage site, birth place of Gautama Buddha Butwal 2,834,612 8,975 6 Dhawalagiri Dhaulagiri mountain Baglun 542,296 8,148 4 Mid-Western Region Rapti West Rapti River Tulsipur 1,456,202 10,482 5 Karnali Karnali River Jumla 388,713 21,351 5 Bheri Bheri River Nepalgunj 1,701,767 10,545 5 Far-Western Region Seti Seti River Dipayal-Silgadhi 1,575,003 12,550 5 Mahakali Mahakali River Mahendranagar 977,514 6,989 4 ==Related pages== *Administrative divisions of Nepal *Development Regions of Nepal *Districts of Nepal *Provinces of Nepal ==References==",
