 "text": "Józef Kowalski (2 February 1900? – 7 December 2013) was the last Polish veteran who served just after World War I, and believed to be the oldest living military veteran in the world, following the death of Gertrude Noone. He fought in the Polish-Soviet War which was linked to World War I and lasted from 1919 to 1921. He lived in Tursk, near Sulęcin, in a care home. He died on 7 December 2013, just 8 weeks and one day before his claimed 114th birthday, and claimed to be the oldest living man for around a half-year after 116-year- old Japaneseman Jiroemon Kimura's death in early-summer of 2013 (although the GRG and the Guinness World Records never verified him as the oldest living man). == References == Category:2013 deaths Category:Military personnel of World War II Category:Polish military people Category:Longevity claims Category:Polish supercentenarians",
