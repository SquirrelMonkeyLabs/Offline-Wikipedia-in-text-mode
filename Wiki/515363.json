 "text": "Maharaja Agrasen (or Agrasena) was a legendary Indian king of Agroha in India. This was a city of traders from whom the cities of Agrawal and Agrahari descend. He started a kingdom of traders in North India named Agroha. He is known for his compassion in refusing to slaughter animals in yajnas. The Government of India issued a postage stamp in honour of Maharaja Agresen in 1976 on the occasion of his 410th birthday. == History == Bharatendu Harishchandra(1850-1885), a renowned Agrawal author and poet regarded as the father of Hindi literature and theatre, compiled the legend of Maharaja Agrasen in his 1871 essay Agarwalon ki Utpatti (\"Origins of Agrawals and Agrahari\"). Drawing from tradition and ancient texts, particularly Sri Mahalakshmi Vrat Ki Katha (\"The Story of the Fast for Goddess Mahalakshmi\"), he documented Agrasen's story. He stated that Sri Mahalakshmi Vrat Ki Katha was contained in the Bhavishya Purana, which exists in several recensions. However, some researchers were unsuccessful in tracing this text.* == References == Category:Legendary Indian Hindu people",
