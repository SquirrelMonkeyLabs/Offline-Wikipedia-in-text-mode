 "text": "K is the eleventh (number 11) letter in the English alphabet. == Meanings for K == * Degrees Kelvin. The kelvin (symbol: K) is the SI unit of temperature. * In chemistry, K is the symbol for potassium (from its German name kalium). * In chess, K is a notation symbol for the king piece * In a deck of playing cards, the letter K is used to mark each of the kings. * Some words in the dictionary are those that only sound as if they should happen to start with an N, but they start with a silent K that comes before it. Kneel means to go down on your knees, and in that case it is one word that starts with the silent K. Knife, which starts with the silent K, is a tool for cutting. Knight also starts with that silent K, and you can also find knickers whenever you get that very amazing word. Of course, this is actually true for everyone! Knit is another word that starts the same. Knickers also starts with the silent K, too. Knot and know also start like it. The letter N always comes after the K when the K is silent. ==Other websites==",
