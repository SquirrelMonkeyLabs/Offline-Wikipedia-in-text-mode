 "text": "The Old Swiss Confederacy, also known as Switzerland or the Swiss Confederacy,(Modern German: ; historically , after the Reformation also , \"Confederation of the Swiss\") was a loose confederation of small states (, German or In the charters of the 14th century described as \"communities\" (, ), the German term Orte becomes common in the early 15th century, used alongside \"estate\" after the Reformation. The French term is used in Fribourg in 1475, and after 1490 is increasingly used in French and Italian documents. It only enters occasional German usage after 1648, and only gains official status as synonym of with the Act of Mediation of 1803. ). These states were all independent and in the Holy Roman Empire. It is now Switzerland. It formed at the end of the 13th century. It started in what is now Central Switzerland. It eventually included Zürich and Bern by the middle of the 14th century. This was one of the few times when rural and urban communes were combined. All of these communes had imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire. The Confederacy had 8 cantons (). It was very successful in politics and military for over a century. It became very important in the Burgundy Wars in the 1470s. The confederacy was very powerful in a very confusing Europe. By 1513, the confederacy had 13 cantons. () The confederacy became neutral in 1647 (after the threat of the Thirty Years' War). However, many Swiss people mecame private mercenaries in the Italian Wars and the early modern period. After the Swabian War of 1499, the confederacy became an independent country de facto throughout the early modern period. The confederacy was still part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Reformation split the confederates into Protestant and Catholic parties. Eventually, there was lots of conflict in the confederacy until the 1700s. In 1798, the French Revolutionary Army took over the confederacy. It then became the Helvetic Republic. == List of cantons == The confederation grew many times. The first was the Eight Cantons (Acht Orte). In 1481, it was 10 cantons. In 1501, it was 12. Finally, it was 13 cantons (Dreizehn Orte).Im Hof, U.. Geschichte der Schweiz, 7th ed., Stuttgart: W.
