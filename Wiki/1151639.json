BYD says the name comes from the attosecond, the smallest unit of time in physics, which symbolizes a \"fast, energetic and dynamic\" car. The original plan was to release Dolphin as Atto 2 and Seal as Atto 4 in export markets. == Overview == Atto 3 was first shown in August 2021 at the Chengdu Auto Show, and was officially unveiled in February 2022. The Atto 3 is based on all-electric e-Platform 3.0. The interior design was inspired by fitness culture and features an aesthetic reminiscent of exercise machines and sports equipment such as treadmills, boxing rings, dumbbells and muscle fibers. The centre 12.8-inch (with an optional larger 15.6-inch) infotainment system is based on Android, and the screen can be rotated between portrait and landscape orientations.
