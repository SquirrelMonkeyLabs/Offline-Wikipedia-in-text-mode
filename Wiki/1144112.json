 "text": "The pallium is a special vestment in the Catholic Church. It is made of white wool and is worn over the shoulders by metropolitan archbishops and the pope. The pallium has small black or red crosses sewn on it and symbolizes the authority of the wearer, as well as their connection to the Pope. The pallium is typically given to new archbishops by the pope during a special ceremony. It is worn during liturgical events and is a sign of the archbishop's jurisdiction over his archdiocese. The tradition of the pallium dates back to the early centuries of the church. It was introduced by Pope Benedict XIV in the 18th century as a formal symbol of the archbishop's role, but its use can be traced back much earlier, to the 4th century. == Related pages == * Archbishop * Cassock == References == Category:Christian symbols Category:Christian clothing Category:Liturgical clothing",
