 "text": "The South Africa national rugby union team (), officially nicknamed the Springboks, represents South Africa in international rugby union. They are South Africa's most successful national sports teams, and are considered the second best rugby union team of all time overall (after New Zealand). They are also currently ranked first on the World Rugby Rankings. South Africa has won the Rugby World Cup four times (in 1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023), which is more times than any other country. Even though South Africa has always been an important country for rugby union and rugby union is very popular in the country, South Africa was not allowed to compete in the first two World Cups (in 1987 and 1991) because of Apartheid. ==References== Category:National rugby union teams Rugby union",
