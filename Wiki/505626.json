 "text": "Aviacsa was a Mexican airline. It started operations in 1990. Aviacsa was a low-cost carrier based in Mexico City. In 2009 the Mexican government refused to allow Aviacsa to fly because of safety concerns. Aviacsa appealed the decision in court. Meanwhile, the FAA removed Aviacia's airworthiness certificate in the United States until it could resolve the safety issues in Mexico. Aviacsa ceased operations in July 2009. It was sold to the Madero Group in 2010. In 2011, Aviacsa was going to start flying again. However, it didn't happen because the airline owed a lot of money to the Mexican Government. Aviacsa stopped all operations for good on May 4, 2011.http://www.travelation.com/airlines/6A-Aviacsa-Airlines Interjet took over many of Aviacsa's old routes. ==Gallery== File:Boeing 727-235, AeroExo AN0135900.jpg|Aviacsa took over an airline called Aeroexo in 1994.
