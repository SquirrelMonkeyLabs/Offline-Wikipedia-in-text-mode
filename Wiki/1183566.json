An international team of experts evaluated the findings before they were released. Ewa Tabeu, the head of the ICTY Demographic Unit, called it \"the largest existing database on Bosnian war victims\".Research and Documentation Center: Rezultati istraživanja \"Ljudski gubici '91–'95\" ==Confirmed casualties== Of the 97,207 casualties documented by 2013: * 60% were soldiers, 40% civilians * 90% were male * 62% were Bosniaks, 25% Bosnian Serbs, and just over 8% Croats * Of civilian victims, 82% were Bosniaks, 10% Bosnian Serbs, and 6.5% Bosnian Croats, with a small number of Jews, Roma and others., pp. 96–98 The percentage of civilian victims would probably have been higher had survivors not reported their loved-ones as \"soldiers\" to access social services and other post-mortem benefits. ==Related pages== * The Holocaust * Bosnian genocide * Cambodian genocide * Genocides by the Soviet Union * Yugoslav massacres of Kosovo Albanians during the Kosovo War ==Notelist== ==References== Category:Publications Category:Bosnian genocide Category:History of Bosnia and Herzegovina",
