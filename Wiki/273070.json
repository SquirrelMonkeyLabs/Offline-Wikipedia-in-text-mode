 "text": "Rocket Mania is a computer puzzle video game made by Nuclide Games and PopCap Games. ==Gameplay== The player rotates fuses to launch rockets. Multiple rockets can be launched because the fuses have junctions. Players can get coins for launching rockets. Five coins will upgrade a rocket. The player goes through different ranks by earning points. Combos can also happen if a fuse launches and then falls. ==Modes== ===Classic=== The game starts at night, with a time limit. Depending on the level, the player will launch a certain number of rockets before they level up. The dragon automatically upgrades the rockets with coins, which in turn gives the player more points. Other types of items can also be awarded. Item values are based on rockets. ===Arcade=== The game starts empty, with tiles filling up the board. The player must lead fuses to rockets before the board fills. ===Strategy=== The player starts with a number of matches. Launching multiple rockets will bring bonus matches to the board, but they will burn out if left there. If the match is carried by the fuse light, the player gets the match. The game ends if the player runs out of matches. == Reception == GameZone awarded the Windows version of the title a 9.2 (out of 10) and an \"Editor's Choice\" award. While the reviewer at GameZone enjoyed the way the difficulty level slowly ramped up, GameSpot felt that the game was a little too simple and that there wasn't any real challenge until the later levels. As such, GameSpot scored the title as only 6.7 (out of 10), although some positive aspects which were noted included an easy control scheme and a decent variety of modes. == References == Category:2003 video games Category:Flash games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Windows games",
