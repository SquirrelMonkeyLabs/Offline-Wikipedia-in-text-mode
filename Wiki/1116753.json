 "text": "The Awa Tanuki Gassen or the Kinchō Tanuki Gassen is a Japanese folktale that takes place in the Awa Province (now Tokushima Prefecture). The legend is about a great war between two tanuki powers. There are several well-known tales about tanuki in Shikkoku, and this one is said to be the most famous among those from Tokushima. == Legend == In the tenpō period (from 1830 to 1844), near Higaino in Komatsushima (now Higaino-chō in the city of Komatsushima, Tokushima), there was a dyer named Moemon who ran a successful dyeing shop called Yamatoya. Moemon saved a tanuki from being bullied by people, and in gratitude, the tanuki became the guardian angel of Mankichi, one of Moemon’s employees. This tanuki was named Kinchō and was the chief of the local tanuki, aged around 206 years old. Kinchō gained a great honor by curing customers’ diseases and performing divination. However, he aspired to rise beyond his tanuki status. He became an apprentice to the bake-danuki Rokuemon, who lived in Tsuda Bay, Myōdō District. After rigorous training, Kinchō almost achieved the rank of Senior First Rank. But Rokuemon, reluctant to let him go, tried to arrange a marriage between Kinchō and his daughter. Kinchō refused, disliking Rokuemon’s cruel personality. Rokuemon, fearing Kinchō might become his enemy, attempted to assassinate him with the help of a vassal. Kinchō fought back, aided by another tanuki named Fuji no Kidera no Taka. In the ensuing battle, Kinchō’s forces emerged victorious, but he suffered mortal wounds and died. Moemon regretted Kinchō’s loss just before achieving Senior First Rank and sought solace by awarding him that title posthumously. == References == Category:Japanese folklore",
