 "text": "Myers' poison frog (Allobates myersi) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. Scientists think it could also live in Peru and Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 28 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 33 mm long. The frog is light brown or medium brown in color with darker brown marks. The chest is blue-gray or dark brown in color. The belly is white in color. The sides of the head and body are blue-black in color. There is a light stripe from the nose over the mouth to where the back legs meet the body. The stripe is cream-white near the nose and yellow near the rear end of the body. There is yellow color near where all four legs meet the body and on the tops of the front legs. Parts of the back legs are red in color. The iris of the eye is gold in color with black marks. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in forests, but people have also seen them on farms. Scientists saw the frog between 100 and 260 meters above sea level. The frog lives in some protected parks: Parque National Natural RÃ­o Pure and Parque National Natural Yaigoje Apaporis. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on dead leaves on the ground. Scientists think the male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. In some places, it is in some danger because human beings change the places where the frog lives to make places for cows to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
