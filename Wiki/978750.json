 "text": "Santana is the first studio album made by Santana, an American Latin rock band. It was released on June 22, 1969. More than half of the album is instrumental music. This was because Santana was a jam band, and they played music without singing. The singles from the album have singing. The album sold better because the band played music at the Woodstock Festival before it was released. The album was on the Billboard 200 music chart for more than two years. In November 1969, it was number four on the chart. A single from the album, \"Evil Ways\", was top ten on music charts in the United States. The album was put on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. == Track listing == == References == Category:Santana (band) albums Category:1969 albums",
