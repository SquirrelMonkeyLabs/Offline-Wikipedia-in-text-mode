 "text": "Harakah is a newspaper started in 1987 by the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). It is mainly in Malay, but it also has an 8-page English section. In 2007, a page in Jawi writing was added. On 16 June 2003, Harakah published a cartoon that insulted Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad by showing him with a pig-like snout. Government MPs protested against the cartoon. On 18 June, the editor, Zulkifli Sulong, apologized for the cartoon. Mahathir later said the government would not take action against Harakah. ==References== == Other websites == * Official website Category:1987 establishments in Asia Category:1980s establishments in Malaysia Category:English-language newspapers published in Asia Category:Malaysian culture",
