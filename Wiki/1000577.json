 "text": "Silent reading means reading without saying the words out loud. Long ago, people didn't have spaces between words in their writing, so it was unusual to read silently. Some people think silent reading can cause problems with thinking, but many schools still encourage it. Reading out loud uses more parts of the brain because it involves speaking and reading at the same time. == References == Category:Reading",
