 "text": "Nintendo 3DS system software is software on the Nintendo 3DS video game console that can be updated. These updates, which are downloaded through the system's Internet connection, lets Nintendo add and take away features and software. Updates also have changes from previous versions. The newest version of the system software, 11.17.0-50, was released on May 22, 2023. ==Home Menu features, changes, and new applications== The Home Menu is a GUI like the Wii's \"Wii Menu\" and the DSi's \"DSi Menu\" which lets you use applications from Nintendo game cards, 3DS applications, or DSiWare applications. The menu has space to show 60 applications, though 120 spaces, for one application each, will show when space starts to run out. On the top screen, the menu shows information such as signal strength, step count, date, time, and battery life. With the home button, the user can go to the HOME menu, except for DS games or DSiWare, which won't let the player go there without quitting the game. From the home screen, the user can manage notes, check friend lists, change the level of light, check notifications, and if updated to the latest version, browse the internet, all without closing the current application. At the home menu, the user can also take photos with the 3D cameras by pressing the L or R buttons. To open another application, the one the player is using must be closed first. Like the DSi, game cards can be swapped while in the menu. ===List of all default applications=== All the following applications come with the latest version of the firmware, with the system: * Health and Safety Information * Nintendo 3DS Camera * Nintendo 3DS Sound * Mii Maker * StreetPass Mii Plaza * AR Games * Face Raiders * Activity Log * Nintendo 3DS Download Play * System Settings * Nintendo eShop * Nintendo Zone ====List of applications that allow multitasking==== All the following applications let you do something else while they are open: * Game Notes * Friend List * Notifications * Internet Browser * Miiverse * DoomVerse * JesusVerse * Miibook * Miiverse 2 ====List of applications that need to be downloaded==== All the following applications need to be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop first: * Ambassador Certificate * Swapnote * Nintendo Video * Pokedex 3D + Pro * Pok√©mon Radar *Nintendo 3DS 3OS dev menu *Nintendo Dev Tool *Nintendo Game Creation Tool *Nintendo Unity *Nintendo's Untitled game *Luigi's Mansion Totally Cool Dude *G.O.A.T The Game *Bowling ==3DS system software versions table== The following is a list of all the versions of Nintendo 3DS firmware.
