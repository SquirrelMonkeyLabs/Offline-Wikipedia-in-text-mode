 "text": "The flag of Palestine () is a horizontal tricolour of black, white, and green; with a red triangle based at the hoist. ==Origin== At the time of World War I, various Arab tribes in the region united together to fight against the Ottomans who had been ruling various land in area for centuries, the event today is known as Arab Revolt. One of the main motive of this revolt was that the Arabs wanted to have their own country, led by Arab leaders. During this time, a leader named Hussein bin Ali, who was Sherif(in charge) of Mecca, made a special flag for this rebellion. This flag was meant to show that they were united and fighting for their own country. It had three stripes, one black, one white, and one green, just like the modern Palestinian Flag although the order of stripes are now changed. This flag became a symbol of their struggle for freedom. A modified version (changing the order of stripes) of this flag has been used in Palestine at least since the late 1930s and was officially adopted as the flag of the Palestinian people by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964. At its first meeting on May 28, 1964, the Palestinian National Council drew up its National Charter, and its Article 27 stated that Palestine would have a flag, an oath, and an anthem, and its colors were specified in order as follows: green, white, then black with a red triangle. On November 15, 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organization adopted the flag as the flag of the Palestinian state. On 30 September 2015, the Palestinian flag was raised for the first time at the UN headquarters alongside flags of 193 other member states. Later that same day, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared September 30 of every year as Palestinian flag day. ==References== Palestine Category:National symbols of the State of Palestine",
