 "text": "Shanakdakhete, also spelled Shanakdakheto or Sanakadakhete, was a queen regnant of the Kingdom of Kush, ruling from Meroë in the early first century AD. Shanakdakhete is poorly attested, though is known to have constructed a temple in Naqa. Shanakdakhete was previously believed to have been the first Kushite queen regnant due to an erroneous dating of her inscriptions. This role is now instead attributed to Nahirqo. ==Sources== Shanakdakhete is known only from hieroglyphic inscriptions at Temple F in Naqa. The inscriptions are accompanied by reliefs depicting the queen, though these are badly damaged. Shanakdakhete was responsible for building Temple F, replacing an earlier structure in the same place. Shanakdakhete is in the inscriptions titled as Son of Ra, Lord of the Two Lands, Shanakdakheto.László Török, The kingdom of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization, 1997 ==See also== *Kandake ==References== Category:Kushite Monarchs Category:Shanakdakhete Category:1st-century monarchs of Kush Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:1st-century monarchs in Africa Category:Queens of Kush",
