In the past, US 10 went from Seattle, Washington to Detroit, Michigan. As Interstate Highways were being built, people used US 10 less. The highway is long. The highway uses the ferry SS Badger between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin across Lake Michigan. The ferry has been a part of US 10 since 2015. The ferry is in use only between May and October. ==References== Category:Transport in North Dakota Category:Transport in Minnesota Category:Transport in Wisconsin Category:Transport in Michigan Category:U.S. Highways",
