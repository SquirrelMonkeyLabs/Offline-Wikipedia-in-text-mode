 "text": "A fashion accessory is a decorative item that supplements one's outfit. Items such as such as jewellery, gloves, handbags, hats, belts, scarves, watches, sunglasses, pins, stockings, bow ties, leggings, ties, suspenders, and tights. Accessories add color, style and class to an outfit, and create a certain look, but they may also have practical functions. Handbags are for carrying small necessary items, hats protect the face from weather, Laptops and mobile phones communicate, and gloves keep the hands warm. Accessories may be used to show religious or cultural affiliation: Crucifixes, Star of David, Islamic headscarves, skullcaps and turbans are common examples. Designer labels on accessories are perceived as an indicator of social status. Accessories are also available in the form of bracelets, necklaces, and earrings.
