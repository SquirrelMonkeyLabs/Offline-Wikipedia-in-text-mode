 "text": "Tanjung Pagar is a district in central Singapore's southern tip. It was a fishing village and is now a centre of commerce. It has a modern container port. It is part of the Greater Southern Waterfront initiative, which should start after 2030. The Tanjong Pagar Centre was completed in 2016 and is the tallest building in Singapore. The Tanjong Pagar railway station was built in 1932 and closed in 2011. The station, with a distinct art deco style has been turned into a museum. It is also the site of Cantonment Mass Rapid Transit station, which should open in 2026. == Historical Evolution == Originally dubbed Salinter (or Salintar), the name Tanjong Pagar, a Malay phrase meaning \"cape of stakes,\" comes from the fishing hamlet. It probably comes from the kelong - offshore palisade fishing traps made from wooden stakes and crosspieces that went from the village of Tanjong Malang to Tanjong Pagar. ==References== Category:Geography of Singapore",
