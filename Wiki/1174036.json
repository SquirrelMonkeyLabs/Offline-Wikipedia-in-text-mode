 "text": "The Jewish Combat Organization (, ŻOB; Yidishe Kamf Organizatsie) was a WWII resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Poland. The ŻOB is well-known for its role in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising between April 19 and May 16, 1943. ==Formation== The ŻOB was formed on July 28, 1942, six days after words began to spread about the Nazi German decision to deport all Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to concentration camps as part of the Holocaust. 23 IV 1943, Warsaw: Odezwa Żydowskiej Organizacji Bojowej z pozdrowieniami z walczącego getta i wezwaniem do walki o wspólną wolność Żydów i Polaków. Polska.pl Skarby Dziedzictwa Narodowego; Nask, 2008 Hashomer Hatzair, a Labor Zionist group, declared,Call to Armed Self-Defense, from Ha-Shomer Ha-Zair newspaper in the Warsaw Underground Jutrznia (\"Dawn\"), March 28, 1942. ==Operation== In November 1942, the ŻOB became part of the Polish Home Army's (Polish: Armia Krajowa, AK) High Command. ===Second deportation=== On January 18, 1943, the Nazis resumed their deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto. 6,000 Jews deported by the Nazi Germans included a number of ŻOB fighters, who had snuck into the deportees. Led by ŻOB's co-founder Mordechai Anielewicz, ŻOB fighters awaited the signal, then broke out to fight the Nazi Germans with small arms. News of the ŻOB, and Jewish Military Union (Żydowski Związek Wojskowy, ŻZW), rising up spread throughout the ghetto. The deportation lasted four days. The Nazi Germans left the Warsaw Ghetto on January 22, 1943. ===Uprising=== The final deportation began on the eve of Passover, April 19 1943. The ghetto's streets were empty as most of the remaining 30,000 Jews were hiding in carefully built bunkers, including their headquarters at Ulica Miła 18. The Nazi Germans were attacked by Jewish fighters when they entered the ghetto. Intense fighting followed. Struggling to deal with the fighters, the Nazi Germans burned down all of the buildings in the ghetto. Fighters hiding in underground bunkers lacked oxygen and started suffocating. On May 8, 1943, fighters started killing themselves to avoid capture. On May 16, 1943, the Warsaw Ghetto was destroyed and the uprising failed. ==Aftermath== 20,000 Jews, including some ŻOB fighters, managed to flee to the Aryan side of Warsaw. Kazik Ratajzer, Zivia Lubetkin, Yitzhak Zuckerman and Marek Edelman joined the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, which saw 90% of Warsaw destroyed and at least 200,000 Poles killed. ===Post-war period=== During the Cold War in Eastern Europe, when many countries were ruled by Soviet-backed communist regimes, both the anti-Jewish nature of the Holocaust and the history of Jewish resistance were suppressed in their official WWII history, * Lappin, Shalom (2006), ‘How Class Disappeared from Western Politics’, Dissent, Vol. 51, No. 1, pp. 73-78. * * * * Kirsch, Adam (2024), On Settler Colonialism: Ideology, Violence, and Justice, W.W. Norton and Company, New York and London. * partly due to Soviet state antisemitism and the native antisemitism in Eastern European communist countries. * * * * * * Western academia, where pro-communist scholars existed in a considerable proportion, also played a role in suppressing the history. The recognition of the importance of WWII Jewish resistance did not become common until the Eastern European countries restored their democracy in the 1990s. ==Gallery of Jewish fighters in Warsaw== File:Mordechai Anielewicz.jpg|Mordechai Anielewicz File:Mira Fuchrer.jpg|Mira Fuchrer File:Yitzhak Zukermann, during his testimony at the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann D408-073 (cropped).jpg|Yitzhak Zukermann File:Zivia_Lubetkin.jpg|Zivia Lubetkin File:Marek Edelman - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.jpg|Marek Edelman File:Izrael Kanal.jpg|Izrael Kanal File:Itzhak Katzenelson.jpg|Itzhak Katzenelson File:MichaelKlepfisz.jpg|Michael Klepfisz File:Vladka Meed (2005).jpg|Vladka Meed File:Symcha Ratajzer i Agnieszka Arnold 052 (cropped).JPG|Symcha Ratajzer File:Yitzhak Sukenik.jpg|Yitzhak Sukenik File:Dawid Wdowiński.jpg|Dawid Wdowiński [ŻZW] ==Related pages== * Antisemitism * Final Solution * Jewish Ghetto uprisings * Holocaust uniqueness debate * Ghettos in Europe during the Holocaust ==References== Category:Poland Category:World War II Category:The Holocaust Category:Jewish history Category:Eastern Europe Category:1940s in Europe Category:History of Europe Category:History of Poland Category:1940s establishments in Europe Category:1940s disestablishments in Europe",
