 "text": "The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (The Fringe) is the worldâ€™s largest arts festival. It started in 1947. It takes place every year at the same time as the Edinburgh International Festival: late August and early September. There are hundreds of different events. There are concerts, theatre, opera, and dance and many informal events. The organisers are the Festival Fringe Society: they publish a programme every year, sell tickets and give advice to performers from the Fringe office on the Royal Mile.* The Edinburgh Festival itself is recognised to offer high-quality events. However, the Fringe events are variable, and entry has no real quality barriers. It is largely an open event where almost any theatrical or show event can be performed. Its lack of supervision means the shows are of unpredictable standard. All events have an entrance charge, which is reasonable because theatres do charge performers. == References == == Other websites == * *Edinburgh Festival Guide full listings and reviews for all the Edinburgh festivals Festival Fringe Category:Festivals in the United Kingdom Category:1947 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1940s establishments in Scotland",
