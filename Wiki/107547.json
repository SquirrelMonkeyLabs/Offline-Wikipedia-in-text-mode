 "text": "FreeDOS is a free and open source operating system. It is made to work just like MS-DOS. Almost all programs that will run on MS-DOS will run on FreeDOS too. It was created because Microsoft did not want to make MS-DOS anymore. FreeDOS can be installed with a floppy or with a CD. ==References== == Other websites == * Official website ; Official blog * Official download site * Official Facebook group * Official SourceForge page * Category:Operating systems",
