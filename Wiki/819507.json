 "text": "\"Lijepa naša domovino\" (; \"Our Beautiful Homeland\") is the national anthem of Croatia. Croatian poet Antun Mihanović wrote the words to it in 1835. Serbian composer Josif Runjanin made the music to it in 1846. The Croatian government made it a national anthem in 1972. Before that, it was often sung by the people as an anthem. The anthem was first called \"Horvatska domovina\" (\"Croatian homeland\"). Some years later, people started calling it by how it's called today. The words of the anthem are also shorter today. Croatians often say the words \"Lijepa naša\" (\"Our beautiful\") instead of saying \"Croatia\". The song has 4 stanzas but only the first two are usually sung. == Lyrics == Croatian original IPA transcription English translation I Our beautiful homeland, Oh so fearless and gracious, Our fathers' ancient glory, May you be blessed forever. Dear, you are our only glory, Dear, you are our only one, Dear, we love your plains, Dear, we love your mountains.''' II Drava, Sava, keep on flowing, Danube, do not lose your vigour, Deep blue sea, tell the world, That a Croat loves his homeland. Whilst his fields are kissed by sunshine, Whilst his oaks are whipped by wild winds, Whilst his dear ones go to heaven, Whilst his live heart beats. ==References== Category:1840s songs Cro Category:National symbols of Croatia",
