 "text": "A mikoshi is a special type of portable shrine that is considered sacred in the Shinto religion in Japan. It is used to carry a deity during festivals or when moving to a new shrine. It looks like a small building with walls, pillars, a roof, a veranda, and a railing. In Japanese, \"o-\" (お) is often added to the front to make the word \"omikoshi\" (お神輿). This prefix is used to show respect or politeness, and is commonly added to words that are considered important or sacred. Moving a kami with one in a festival is called Shinko- shiki. Omikoshi are common in parades alongside Matsuri floats == Related pages == * Matsuri Float == References == * Sokyo Ono, William P. Woodward, Shinto - The Kami Way, Charles E.
