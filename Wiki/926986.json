 "text": "Siobhan Fitzpatrick (born 28 January 1998) is a British wheelchair basketball player. She is a member of the Great Britain women's national wheelchair basketball team. She competed at the 2020 Summer Paralympics. With the national team she won the silver medal at the 2018 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship, the bronze medal at the 2017 European Championships and the silver medal at the 2019 European Championships. Fitzpatrick has cerebral palsy. She was unable to do sport at school due to insurance problems. She took part at a wheelchair basketball 'playground to podium' event in 2010, where she was spotted by a coach. She became part of the Coventry Wheelchair Basketball Academy and became later a member of the national team. She was not selected for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. That was a big disappointment for her. She fell out of love for wheelchair basketball and for two or three months she didn't even play in the national league. Later she could place the disappointment in perspective and continued playing. Fitzpatrick studied Business Management at the University of Worcester. She has a partner, Mat. She was a member of the Athlete's Advisory Committee for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. == References == Category:1998 births Category:Wheelchair basketball players Category:Paralympic competitors for Great Britain Category:Living people",
