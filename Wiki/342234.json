 "text": "A television presenter (often referred to as a television personality or television host) is a person who introduces or hosts television programs, often serving as a mediator for the program and the audience. Nowadays, it is common for people who garnered fame in other fields to take on this role, but some people have made their name solely within the field of presenting—such as children's television series or infomercials—to become television personalities. ==Related pages== * Television director * Television producer Category:Television presenters",
