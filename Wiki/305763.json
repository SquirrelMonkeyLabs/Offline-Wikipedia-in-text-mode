In the lowland areas, particularly Vestvågøy, agriculture is important and has been so since the Bronze Age. == Other websites == * Lofotrådet (in Norwegian) * Turisme- og begivenhetsinformasjon om Lofoten (in Norwegian) * Miljøstatus i Norge: Lofoten og Barentshavet (in Norwegian) * Lofot-Tidende online (in Norwegian) Category:Islands of Norway",
