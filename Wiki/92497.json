Her assassination made many Irish people angry, which brought down many drug dealers on the island. The criminal John Gilligan was later convicted of her murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison, though Gilligan said in High Court that it was his friend John Traynor who murdered Guerin. ==References== Category:Irish journalists Category:People murdered in Europe Category:Murders by firearm Category:Writers from Dublin Category:1958 births Category:1996 deaths Category:CPJ International Press Freedom Award winners",
