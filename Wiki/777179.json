 "text": "There are different ideas of freedom. In terms of politics, there are various large movements: * Liberalism thinks that the freedom of each person is important. Things such as human rights, or a number of freedoms guaranteed by a constitution are achievements of liberal thinkers. * Anarchism is against all forms of government. Anarchists think there should be no government. * Conservatism thinks that the current institutions and organisation are a result of culture. It thinks that the concepts that are there are not bad, and that new structures and ideas should build on them. * Socialism and Communism think that the working class has been exploited. According to Karl Marx personal liberty has been exchanged for the exchange of goods and services. * Nationalism tries to put the own people first. One's own people should have the right to not be oppressed. * In Totalitarianism, there is one leader (or a very small group of people) who determines what is good for the people. == Related pages == * Internet censorship Category:Community Category:Human rights Category:Law Category:Liberalism Category:Political philosophy Category:Rights",
