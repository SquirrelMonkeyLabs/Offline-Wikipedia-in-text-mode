 "text": "Hazel's tree frog, (Sarcohyla hazelae) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it in pine-oak forests, in cloud forests, and in other mountain forests. People have seen it between 1,461 and 2,128 meters above sea level. This frog is in some danger of dying out. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to get wood to build with. People also drain away the water in its streams. This frog lays eggs in mountain streams. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
