 "text": "Mod-Files is an online service that provides ECU (Engine Control Unit) tuning files for various types of vehicles, including cars, commercial trucks, and agricultural machinery. The platform allows users to upload ECU software files for custom modification, primarily aimed at changing engine parameters for performance, fuel efficiency, or functionality enhancements. While the service is used by both individual enthusiasts and automotive professionals, the actual tuning process typically involves advanced knowledge of engine software and tuning tools. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/motor http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/engine.htm http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/engine.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20080218171021/http://www.history-science- technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20120204034636/http://www.history.rochester.edu/steam/thurston/1878/Chapter1.html https://web.archive.org/web/20170225042248/http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/documentiStorici.html https://books.google.com/books?id=DoYaRsNFlEYC&dq;=cc+engine&pg;=PA34 https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/290504/internal-combustion-engine https://www.motor.com/magazine-summary/electrically-assisted-thermostat https://www.scribd.com/doc/147785416/Experimental-Investigations-on-a- Standing-Wave-Thermoacoustic-Engine#fullscreen https://web.archive.org/web/20090821175006/http://reference.howstuffworks.com/hydraulic- engine-encyclopedia.htm ==History== The emergence of Mod-Files coincided with the broader growth of ECU remapping in the automotive industry. As vehicles became more dependent on electronic control systems, the demand for software- based modifications grew. The platform was created to meet this need, providing an accessible way for users to modify vehicle performance parameters through downloadable tuning files. https://www.cartechbooks.com/products/engine-management-advanced-tuning https://automodifying.com/does-a-bigger-throttle-body-increase- horsepower/#:~:text=Added%20Power,those%20power%20gains http://www.mattituck.com/articles/ohterms.htm https://www.jasperengines.com/remanufactured-engines-faq ==Usage== The platform operates on a credit-based system. Users create an account and purchase credits to upload their ECU files. Once uploaded, files are analyzed and modified according to the requested specifications. The tuned files are usually delivered within an hour, although this can vary depending on complexity. https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/45050 https://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/contentype/scoreboard/2021-12/EU%20RD%20Scoreboard%202021%20FINAL%20online.pdf https://books.google.com/books?id=pS8rAAAAYAAJ&q;=Society+of+Automobile+Engineers+-inauthor%3A%22Society+of+Automotive+Engineers%22&pg;=PA164 https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/timeline-car- manufacturing-2088018.html https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&q;=U.S.+makes+ninety+percent+of+world%27s+automobiles&pg;=PA84 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00170-021-08007-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8587767 https://web.archive.org/web/20121013151102/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/gtrends/gtrends396.htm https://web.archive.org/web/20150704135550/http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Manufacturing/gx- global-automotive-consumer-study-europe-final.pdf https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/02/auto-industry-sets-new-world-record- in-2010-will-do-it-again-in-2011 https://web.archive.org/web/20110217022100/http://businesscenter.jdpower.com/news/pressrelease.aspx?ID=2011018 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541 https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/https://www.ft.com/content/8c4a1809-902f-4582-a29e-1c83a97b9dff https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/cop26-every-carmaker-that-pledged-to- stop-selling-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2040 https://www.globalfueleconomy.org/media/792523/gfei-trends-in-the-global- vehicle-fleet-2023-spreads.pdf ==Regulatory Considerations== ECU tuning is regulated differently across regions. In many jurisdictions, disabling emission-related systems like the DPF or EGR may violate environmental laws. Additionally, such modifications can void manufacturer warranties. Users are typically advised to consult local regulations before applying any modifications provided by tuning services like Mod-Files. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toyota-suzuki-idUSKCN1VI0MI http://www.caradvice.com.au/572997/toyota-buys-stake-in-mazda-joint-us- factory-ev-development-planned/ https://www.bbc.com/news/business-36273122 https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/smart/106448/mercedes-and-geely-officially- announce-joint-ownership-of-smart-brand https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-23/proton-owner-said-to-agree- to-sell-stake-in-carmaker-to-geely-j31o98jt https://www.reuters.com/article/us-baic-daimler-idUSKCN1UI0IY https://web.archive.org/web/20170117015645/http://www.perodua.com.my/corporate/company https://www.factorywarrantylist.com/car-sales-by-manufacturer.html http://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/World-Ranking-of-Manufacturers-1.pdf https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/By-country-region-2023.pdf http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/australias-car-industry-one-year- from-closing-its-doors-20151012-gk7ip0.html http://oica.net/wp- content/uploads/2007/06/cl98type.pdf https://www.bts.gov/bts/archive/publications/national_transportation_statistics/table_01_23 * * * – Number of cars in use (in millions) in various European countries in 1973 and 1992 * * * * * – Number of motor vehicles registered in Latin America in 1970 * – Number of registered passenger cars in various countries in 1959-60 and 1969–70 ==References== ===Citations=== Category:Machines Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Motors",
