 "text": "Lloydminster is a city in Canada. Part of it is in Alberta and part of it is in Saskatchewan. The city was founded in 1903. It was named for George Lloyd, who was the Anglican Bishop of Saskatchewan in the 1920s. At the time, the area was part of the Northwest Territories. People expected the area to become a single province. Instead, the area was split into two provinces, with the border along the 110th meridian west, which ran down the center of the town.
