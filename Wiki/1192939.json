 "text": "Nahirqo is the name attributed to a Kushite queen regnant buried in pyramid Beg N. 11 in MeroÃ«. Nahirqo is the earliest known woman to have ruled the Kingdom of Kush, reigning in the middle second century BC. Prior to her own reign, Nahirqo is believed to have been the queen consort of King Adikhalamani. The name Shanakdakhete was previously attributed to this queen, though re-assessments have demonstrated that Shanakdakhete reigned much later, in the first half of the first century CE. ==Gallery== File:Sudan Meroe Pyramids 2001 N11.jpg|Pyramid Beg.
