 "text": "The Sack of Bihar in 1200 AD was a pivotal incident in the Ghurid conquest of the Indian subcontinent. Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khalji led Ghurid forces against the land of Bihar, which was renowned for its leading Buddhist monasteries and institutions of learning. Khalji forces attacked these monasteries, leading to the massacre of monks and the devastation of institutions like Odantapuri and Vikramashila. This attack not only brought the annexation of southern Bihar into the Ghurid Empire but also created a significant reduction in Buddhist presence in the region. The success of this campaign opened the door for more Ghurid invasions of Bengal and further established their grip on eastern India. ==Background== The Ghurid campaigns in India (1175–1206) comprised a series of conquests by Muhammad of Ghor, which extended the Ghurid Empire in the Indian subcontinent. He initiated his attacks in 1175 and seized the Indus Basin from the Ghaznavids and Ismāʿīlīs. In 1192, he routed Prithviraj Chauhan at the Second Battle of Tarain, avenging a previous defeat and establishing a lasting Muslim foothold in India. Even though the Ghurid Empire disintegrated in 1215, the successes of Muhammad determined subsequent government in the land. His raids expelled a number of local kingdoms, such as the Ismāʿīlīs of Multan, Ghaznavids of Lahore, Chauhans of Ajmer, and Tomaras of Delhi. He was murdered in March 15, 1206, on the banks of the Indus. ==Battle== Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji began his rise in Bhuili near Chunar, defeating local Gahadavala chiefs and expanding eastward into Bihar. His success attracted Khiljis and Turks seeking new lands. Blocked by the powerful Hindu Karnat dynasty in Mithila, he focused on South Bihar (territories of Lakshmana Sena of Sena dynasty and Harishchandra of Gahadavala dynasty), gaining support from Qutbuddin Aibak. Despite his conquests, many Hindu rulers, like those of Kannauj and Rohtak, remained independent, though Muslim records largely ignored them. Muhammad Bakhtiyar shunned major battles and concentrated on swift raids for loot. In 1199 AD, he raided a monastery in Bihar (Odantapuri Vihara), murdered its monks, and plundered its wealth. After that, the area came to be known as \"Bihar\" after its numerous monasteries. In 1200 AD, he came back to consolidate his authority, establishing military outposts. During this time, Buddhist monk Sakya Sribhadra discovered Odantapuri and Vikramashila devastated and escaped to Jagaddala Monastery in fear of the Turkish invaders. ==Aftermath== Bhakhtiyar Khalji, after the successful annexation of Bihar to the Ghurid dynasty, learned about the Sena Dynasty and its illustrious ruler, Lakshmana Sena. Despite Sena's advanced age and reputation, Khalji was determined to extend his conquests further into Bengal. Upon hearing of Khalji's intent to invade Bengal, many Brahmins and traders decided to leave the Sena capital in search of safer locations. However, in a display of resilience, Lakshmana Sena chose to remain in Nadiya, ready to defend his realm. == References == Category:Pakistan Category:India",
