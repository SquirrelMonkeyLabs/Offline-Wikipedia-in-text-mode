 "text": "Xherdan Shaqiri (born 10 October 1991), is a Swiss association football player of Albanian descent who plays for FC Basel. He has played for the Switzerland national team. Since he first started playing football, he has been known for his fast speed on and off the ball. The FIFA website describes Shaqiri as \"unpredictable on the ball, adept with both feet, clinical in front of goal and [possessing] excellent vision\". Due to his small stature, the fans nicknamed Shaqiri \"XS\", by analogy with the size of clothes, which coincides with his initials. Also he has been nicknamed the \"Alpine Messi\" and \"magic dwarf\". In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he was one of the top scorers with 3 goals after scoring a hat-trick against Honduras. == References == Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Swiss footballers Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:2010 FIFA World Cup players Category:2014 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2016 players Category:2018 FIFA World Cup players Category:2022 FIFA World Cup players Category:Switzerland at the 2010 FIFA World Cup Category:Switzerland at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Category:Switzerland at UEFA Euro 2016 Category:Switzerland at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Category:Switzerland at UEFA Euro 2020 Category:Switzerland at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Category:UEFA Euro 2024 players",
