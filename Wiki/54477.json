It is a translation of the Hebrew word /ger (Strong's H1616 ). ==Two kinds of proselyte in Judaism== There are two kinds of proselyte: # Ger tzedek (righteous proselytes, proselytes of righteousness, religious proselyte, devout proselyte) # Ger toshav (gate proselyte, proselytes of the gate, limited proselyte, half-proselyte) A righteous proselyte was a Gentile who had converted to Judaism, was bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and was considered a full member of the Jewish people. A gate proselyte was a \"resident alien\" who lived in the Land of Israel and followed some of the customs. ==Proselytes in early Christianity== The \"religious proselytes\" spoken of in Early Christian writings were righteous proselytes, as distinguished from gate proselytes. ==References== ==Related pages== *Proselytism == Other websites == *Petrine Proselytes *Catholic Encyclopedia: Proselyte *Jewish Encyclopedia: Proselyte *Free Online Book: 'The Path of the Righteous Gentile' *Proselyte in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Category:Biblical people Category:Judaism",
