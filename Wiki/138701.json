 "text": "Shamanism is a practice where a practitioner reaches altered states of consciousness. Supposedly, the shaman perceives and interacts with a spirit world, and channels these energies into this world.Hoppál, Mihály 2007. Is shamanism a folk religion?. Shamans and Traditions, vol 13. Bibliotheca Shamanistica. Budapest: Akadémiai Kiadó. A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of good and bad spirits. They usually enter into a trance state during a ritual, and do divination and healing.Oxford Dictionary Online. To become a shaman, a person has to have had a near death experience (a \"shamanic illness\"). The name \"shaman\" comes from the Evenki people in Siberia. Shamans play a central role in these movements, as they can be in both worlds, this one, and the world of spirits. ==Beliefs== * Spirits are real and can do things in the real world. * There are good and evil spirits. * Healing can be done in the spirit and real world. * A person's spirit can leave their body and go into the world of the spirits. * Animal shapes are used to interact with the spirits. Shamanism is different from animism. ==Films== *Quantum Men (Carlos Serrano Azcona) Spain 2011 *Other Worlds (Jan Kounen) France 2004 *Bells From the Deep (Werner Herzog) Germany 1993 *The Mad Masters (Jean Rouch) France 1955 *Au pays des mages noirs (Jean Rouch) France 1947 == References == Category:Religious leaders Category:Cultural anthropology",
