Situated on the northern shore of Lake Balaton, the town is home to 13,000 people. It is a popular yachting destination and is regarded as the capital of the Northern Lake Shore. == Description == Listed buildings from the mid-18th and 19th centuries, two marinas, a series of springs with carbonated mineral water, and excellent dining options can all be found in the town. Tihany, Aszófő, Balatonszőlős, and Csopak are the closest settlements to Balatonfüred and are also well-known for its wine, land, and beaches. The town is traversed by Highway No. 71 and a single-track railway line that runs between Tapolca and Budapest. The State Hospital for Cardiology has replaced the shipyard, which used to be the town's biggest employer. Catering and the provision of boarding and other lodgings make up the major industry. The town has a pier, a harbour, a large camping site and several private marinas. The warm microclimate, scenery, Olaszrizling grape-based local wine, sailing and swimming facilities, and the opportunity to resurrect the two-century-old custom of mingling around spas, bathing, and vacationing are the main draws for tourists. The two-month-long summer holiday season's highlights include a wine-tasting festival in August and a ball for first-time guests with a beauty pageant. On the lake, swans. Take note of the shore's red sandstone rocks. The town is home to three churches: a modern Evangelist church, a white Protestant church, and a traditional Catholic church built of red sandstone.
