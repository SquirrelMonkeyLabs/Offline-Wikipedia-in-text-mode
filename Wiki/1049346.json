 "text": "The Sous region (also spelt Sus, Suss, Souss or Sousse) is a historical part of Morocco, which is part of the administration of Souss-Massa and Guelmim- Oued Noun. The region is known for the argan tree (which has become a symbol of Souss) as well as for being the capital of the Shilha Berber ethnic group. It is a big commercial and tourist region of the Kingdom. Vegetable production, shared between very big farms and small producers, helps the economic development of the region. The Souss plain produces 40% of Moroccan citrus fruits, and 60% of the production of early vegetables. It was historically a big part of trans-Saharan trade. == History == Medieval Arab geographers split the Sous region into two sub-regions: al-Sūs al-Aqṣā, or \"farther Sus\", and al-Sūs al-Adnā, or \"nearer Sus\". Sus al-Aqsa was the southern/western part, and Sus al-Adna was the northern/eastern part; however, there were never any exact boundaries between the two. The capital of the Sous was at Igli. There was also a ribat at Massa near the Atlantic coast. == References == == Other websites == *Euratlas Periodis Web - Map of Suss in Year 1600 Category:Geography of Morocco Category:History of Morocco",
