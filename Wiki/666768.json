 "text": "The 1967 Baltimore Colts season was the 15th season for the team in the National Football League. They ended the regular season with a record of 11 wins, 1 loss, and 2 ties. This was the same record the Los Angeles Rams achieved. Since the Rams were in the same division, the Colts lost the tie based on point differential in head-to-head games and thus did not make the playoffs. The Colts' win percentage of .917 (The NFL did not count ties for such purposes until 1972) is the best in North American pro sports history for a team that did not make the playoffs == Team and Staff == === Staff/Coaches === 1967 Baltimore Colts staff Front Office * Owner/President and Treasurer – Carroll Rosenbloom * General Manager – Harry Hulmes Coaching Staff * Head Coach – Don Shula Offensive Coaches * Receivers/Offensive Ends – Dick Bielski * Offensive Backs – Don McCafferty * Offensive Line Coach - John Sandusky Defensive Coaches * Defensive Coordinator/Defensive Line - Bill Arnsparger * Defensive Backfield – Chuck Noll * Linebackers Coach – Don Shula === Roster === 1967 Baltimore Colts roster Quarterbacks * 19 Johnny Unitas * 16 Jim Ward Running backs 2 Timmy Brown * 33 Tony Lorick FB * 45 Jerry Hill 41 Tom Matte 26 Preston Pearson Wide receivers 82 raymond Berry 25 Alex Hawkins 28 Jimmy Orr 29 Don Alley 27 Ray Perkins 87 Willie Richardson Tight ends 88 John Mackey 84 Tom Mitchell 86 Butch Wilson Offensive linemen 67 Dale Memmelaar G/T 73 Sam Ball T 77 Jim Parker (American football) G/T * 50 Bill Curry C * 71 Dan Sullivan G 52 Dick Szymanski C 72 Bob Vogel T * 62 Glenn Ressler G 63 Norman Davis (American football) G Defensive linemen 81 Ordell Braase DE 85 Roy Hilton DE 76 Fred Miller DT 74 Billy Ray Smith DT 78 Bubba Smith DE 83 Andy Stynchula DE Linebackers 32 Mike Curtis 53 Dennis Gaubatz 55 Ron Porter * 36 Barry Brown (American football) 66 Don Shinnick Defensive backs 30 Alvin Haymond KR 40 Bobby Boyd CB 20 Jerry Logan S 42 George Harold DB 43 Lenny Lyles CB 47 Charlie Stukes CB 21 Rick Volk S Special teams * 49 David Lee P * 79 Lou Michaels K Reserve lists None - vacant Rookies in italics == Regular season == === Schedule === Week Date Opponent Result Record Game Site Attendance 1 September 17, 1967 Atlanta Falcons W 38–31 1–0 Memorial Stadium 56,715 style=\"text:align: center\"2 September 24, 1967 at Philadelphia Eagles W 38–6 2–0 Franklin Field 60,755 3 October 1, 1967 San Francisco 49ers W 41–7 3–0 Memorial Stadium style=\"text:align: center\"60,238 style=\"text:align: center\"4 October 8, 1967 at Chicago Bears W 24–3 4–0 Wrigley Field style=\"text:align: center\"47,190 5 October 15, 1967 Los Angeles Rams T 24–24 4–0–1 Memorial Stadium style=\"text:align: center\"60,238 6 October 22, 1967 at Minnesota Vikings T 20–20 4–0–2 Metropolitan Stadium style=\"text:align: center\"47,693 7 October 29, 1967 at Washington Redskins W 17–13 5–0–2 D.C.
