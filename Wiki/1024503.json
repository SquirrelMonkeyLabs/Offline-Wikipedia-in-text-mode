The incumbent Labor government, led by Premier Anna Bligh, tried to win a ninth term in government. It lost to the Liberal National Party (LNP), led by Campbell Newman, in a landslide. It was a wipeout loss for the Labor Party, which only won seven seats, its worst ever seat total. Newman won the largest majority government in Queensland history. ==References== Category:Elections in Queensland Category:2012 elections in Australia Category:2010s in Queensland Category:March 2012 events",
