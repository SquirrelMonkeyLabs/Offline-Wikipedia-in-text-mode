 "text": "Homeric Greek is the language used by Homer (in his epics: The Iliad and Odyssey) and by Hesiod. It is also known as Epic Greek. It is called Epic Greek because it was used as the language of epic poetry. This is usually in dactylic hexameter, by poets such as Hesiod and Theognis of Megara. Compositions in Epic Greek disappeared with the rise of Koine Greek.Bakker, Egbert J., ed. 2010. A companion to the Ancient Greek language.
