 "text": "Banana bread is a sweet bread made with batter that is full of mashed bananas, ground cinnamon, and toasted nuts. Some may also have chocolate in them. It was first baked in the United States and became very popular because it was so easy to make. It is different from most breads because it is a quick bread, using baking powder to rise. There are many different kinds of banana bread. The dry ingredients are mixed together in one bowl, and the wet ingredients are mixed together in another bowl. The two are then put together, and baked, and then the making of a banana bread is done. ==Related pages== *Raisin bread *Sweetbread == References == Category:Sweet breads Category:Banana dishes",
