 "text": "The words immediately dangerous to life or health or IDLH mean that chemicals in the air could be high enough to be bad for a person's health. The high amount of chemicals in the air could cause quick injury or death. The amount in the United States is set by NIOSH and OSHA. Many equations are used to find the \"lethal dose\", which is also called \"LD\". NIOSH then publishes the numbers that show how much of a chemical is bad. IDLH numbers have been used to help people choose the right respirator. == Related pages == * NIOSH * OSHA == References == == Other websites == * https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/ * http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p;_id=12716 1910.134(b) Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services Category:United States Department of Labor",
