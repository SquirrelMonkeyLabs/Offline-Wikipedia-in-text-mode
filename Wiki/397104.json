 "text": "In chemistry, a cyclic compound is a molecule where some atoms are linked together forming a loop or ring. Most of the time, these molecules are organic. There are also many examples of inorganic molecule forming rings. Cyclic compounds can be aromatic - in this case they are flat. Benzene is a simple aromatic cyclic compound. When they are not aromatic, rings tend not to be flat to avoid steric effects. Image:Benzol.svg|Benzene, an aromatic cyclic compound.

There are many reactions that can make or break cyclic compounds. One important class of these is pericyclic reactions.",
