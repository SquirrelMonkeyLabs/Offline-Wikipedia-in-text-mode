The Four Freedoms of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt are the following: *Freedom of speech *Freedom of worship *Freedom from want *Freedom from fear Roosevelt had the monument built with the idea to inspire a greater public for his four freedoms. The monument was first presented in 1943 in Madison Square Garden in New York City, with the presence of 60,000 people. It was presented in the honor of Colin Kelly, one of the first Americans to be named an American hero of the Second World War.
