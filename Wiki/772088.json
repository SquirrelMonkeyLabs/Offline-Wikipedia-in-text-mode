It is located 6 miles (10 km) west of Swindon, Wiltshire's largest town. Elizabeth II granted the town royal status in 2011. This was done in recognition of the town's role in the 21st-century military funeral repatriations, which passed through the town. The town has an Arts Festival. The festival celebrates music, speech and drama. Events take place every year in June and November. ==Twin town== Royal Wootton Bassett is twinned with: * Blain, Loire-Atlantique, France ==Gallery== File:St_Bartholomew_and_All_Saints_church,_Wootton_Bassett_- _geograph.org.uk_-_1568065.jpg|St Bartholomew and All Saints Church File:Wootton_Bassett_War_Memorial.jpg|Wootton Bassett War Memorial File:Wootton_Bassett_Post_Office_..._(5198778397).jpg|Wootton Bassett Post Office Category:Towns in Wiltshire Category:Market towns in England Category:Royal Towns in the United Kingdom Category:Civil parishes in Wiltshire",
