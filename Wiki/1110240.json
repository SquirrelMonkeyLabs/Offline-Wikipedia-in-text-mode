 "text": "The Government of Norway is a constitutional monarchy, which means that it has a king and queen, but they do not have much real power. People that are elected to power work with the monarch to govern the country. The government proposes laws to the Storting, which is the parliament. The prime minister leads the government. The executive power is held by the Council of State, which is a cabinet led by the prime minister. The legislative power is shared between the government and the Storting. The judiciary, or the system of courts, is independent from both the executive branch and the legislature. == History == On 17 May 1814, Norway got its own constitution, which established a constitutional monarchy. This meant that Norway would have a king, but his power would be limited by the constitution. The constitution also created the Storting, Norway's parliament. In 1884, Norway introduced something called negative parliamentarism. This means that the government must not be mistrusted by the Storting to stay in power. If the Storting shows a lack of confidence in the government, the government has to resign. In 1905, Norway became fully independent from Sweden and continued to develop its democratic system. == Related pages == * Norway * Prime Minister of Norway == References ==",
