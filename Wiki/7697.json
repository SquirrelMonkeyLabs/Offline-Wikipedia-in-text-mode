 "text": "A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid) with several uses. A ball can be either hollow, such as a basketball, or solid, such as a ball bearing. Ball is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, making a fist into a ball. A ball also can be described in certain sports, such as baseball and basketball. Category:Basic English 850 words",
