 "text": "Joel Norman Quenneville (born September 15, 1958 in Windsor, Ontario) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player and coach. He coached in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was the head coach for the St. Louis Blues from 1996 to 2004, the Colorado Avalanche from 2005 to 2008, the Chicago Blackhawks from 2008 to 2018, and the Florida Panthers from 2019 to 2021. He won the 3 Stanley Cups with the Blackhawks in 2010, 2013 and 2015. On October 27, 2021, Quenneville stepped down as head coach of the Panthers after meeting with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. Quenneville was removed from the NHL because of his involvement with the Blackhawks scandal. He will need permission from the NHL if he wants another job in the league. ==Career statistics== Regular season Regular season Regular season Regular season Regular season Playoffs Playoffs Playoffs Playoffs Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1975–76 Windsor Spitfires OMJHL 66 15 33 48 61 — — — — — 1976–77 Windsor Spitfires OMJHL 65 19 59 78 169 9 6 5 11 112 1977–78 Windsor Spitfires OMJHL 66 27 76 103 114 6 2 3 5 17 1978–79 New Brunswick Hawks AHL 16 1 10 11 10 — — — — — 1978–79 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 61 2 9 11 60 6 0 1 1 4 1979–80 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 32 1 4 5 24 — — — — — 1979–80 Colorado Rockies NHL 35 5 7 12 26 — — — — — 1980–81 Colorado Rockies NHL 71 10 24 34 86 — — — — — 1981–82 Colorado Rockies NHL 64 5 10 15 55 — — — — — 1982–83 New Jersey Devils NHL 74 5 12 17 46 — — — — — 1983–84 Hartford Whalers NHL 80 5 8 13 95 — — — — — 1984–85 Hartford Whalers NHL 79 6 16 22 96 — — — — — 1985–86 Hartford Whalers NHL 71 5 20 25 83 10 0 2 2 12 1986–87 Hartford Whalers NHL 37 3 7 10 24 6 0 0 0 0 1987–88 Hartford Whalers NHL 77 1 8 9 44 6 0 2 2 2 1988–89 Hartford Whalers NHL 69 4 7 11 32 4 0 3 3 4 1989–90 Hartford Whalers NHL 44 1 4 5 34 — — — — — 1990–91 Baltimore Skipjacks AHL 59 6 13 19 58 6 1 1 2 6 1990–91 Washington Capitals NHL 9 1 0 1 0 — — — — — 1991–92 St. John's Maple Leafs AHL 73 7 23 30 58 16 0 1 1 10 NHL totals NHL totals NHL totals 803 54 136 190 705 32 0 8 8 22 AHL totals AHL totals AHL totals 148 14 46 60 126 22 1 2 3 16 ==Coaching record== Team Year Regular season Postseason G W L T OTL Pts Finish W L Win % Result STL 1996–97 40 18 15 7 — (83) 4th in Central 2 4 Lost in Conference Quarterfinals (DET) STL 1997–98 82 45 29 8 — 98 3rd in Central 6 4 Lost in Conference Semifinals (DET) STL 1998–99 82 37 32 13 — 87 2nd in Central 6 7 Lost in Conference Semifinals (DAL) STL 1999–2000 82 51 19 11 1 114 1st in Central 3 4 Lost in Conference Quarterfinals (SJS) STL 2000–01 82 43 22 12 5 103 2nd in Central 9 6 Lost in Conference Finals (COL) STL 2001–02 82 43 27 8 4 98 2nd in Central 5 5 Lost in Conference Semifinals (DET) STL 2002–03 82 41 24 11 6 99 2nd in Central 3 4 Lost in Conference Quarterfinals (VAN) STL 2003–04 61 29 23 7 2 (91) (fired) — — — — STL total 593 307 191 77 18 34 34 7 playoff appearances COL 2005–06 82 43 30 — 9 95 2nd in Northwest 4 5 Lost in Conference Semifinals (ANA) COL 2006–07 82 44 31 — 7 95 4th in Northwest — — — Missed playoffs COL 2007–08 82 44 31 — 7 95 2nd in Northwest 4 6 Lost in Conference Semifinals (DET) COL total 246 131 92 — 23 8 11 2 playoff appearances CHI 2008–09 78 45 22 — 11 (104) 2nd in Central 9 8 Lost in Conference Finals (DET) CHI 2009–10 82 52 22 — 8 112 1st in Central 16 6 Won Stanley Cup (PHI) CHI 2010–11 82 44 29 — 9 97 3rd in Central 3 4 Lost in Conference Quarterfinals (VAN) CHI 2011–12 82 45 26 — 11 101 4th in Central 2 4 Lost in Conference Quarterfinals (PHX) CHI 2012–13 48 36 7 — 5 77 1st in Central 16 7 Won Stanley Cup (BOS) CHI 2013–14 82 46 21 — 15 107 3rd in Central 11 8 Lost in Conference Finals (LAK) CHI 2014–15 82 48 28 — 6 102 3rd in Central 16 7 Won Stanley Cup (TBL) CHI 2015–16 82 47 26 — 9 103 3rd in Central 3 4 Lost in First Round (STL) CHI 2016–17 82 50 23 — 9 109 1st in Central 0 4 Lost in First Round (NSH) CHI 2017–18 82 33 39 — 10 76 7th in Central — — — Missed playoffs CHI 2018–19 15 6 6 — 3 15 (fired) — — — — CHI total 797 452 249 — 96 76 52 9 playoff appearances 3 Stanley Cup titles FLA 2019–20 69 35 26 — 8 78 4th in Atlantic 1 3 .250 Lost in Qualifying Round (Islanders) FLA total 69 35 26 — 8 1 3 1 playoff appearances Total Total 1,705 925 558 77 145 119 100 19 playoff appearances 3 Stanley Cup titles ==References== ==Other websites== * *Profile at hockeydraftcentral.com Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Baltimore Skipjacks players Category:Canadian ice hockey coaches Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Colorado Rockies (NHL) players Category:Hartford Whalers players Category:Jack Adams Award winners Category:New Brunswick Hawks players Category:New Jersey Devils players Category:Ontario Hockey League players Category:Ice hockey people from Windsor, Ontario Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:St. John's Maple Leafs players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Washington Capitals players",
