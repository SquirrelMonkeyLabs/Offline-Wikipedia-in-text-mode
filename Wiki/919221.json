 "text": "Category:Arizona 602 Area code 602 is an area code of Arizona. It was one of the earliest area codes ever created in 1947. It initially covered the entire state of Arizona, but after it was split by 520 in 1995, 623 and 480 both on March 1, 1999, and 928 in 2001, it covered only the Phoenix area of the state until June 14, 2023, at which point, the boundary split between 602, 480, and 623 was removed to form an overlay complex, since 480 and 602 are predicted to be used up in 2024 and 2026, respectively, while 623 is predicted to be used up only in 2061. As of 2023, besides covering Phoenix, it also covers Peoria, Sun City, Avondale, Mesa, Chandler, Scottsdale, Gilbert and Tempe.",
