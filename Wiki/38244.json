Sharpe has a series of \"sword waving\" adventures. So far, the writer has written 21 books, from \"Sharpe's Tiger\" to \"Sharpe's Devil\". The first book is set in the year 1799, while the last is set in the years 1820 to 1821. There were also three short stories set between other books.

For this, he was given a field commission to the rank of Lieutenant.
