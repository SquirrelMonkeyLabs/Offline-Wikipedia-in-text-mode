 "text": "A will or testament is a legal document that explains the last wishes of someone after they die. It is sometimes called a \"last will and testament\". A person writes a will and testament before they die, and usually writes what they want to happen to their estate (money and their things) after they die. A will may also provide for other issues including, * Stating preferences for funeral arrangements, * Designating a guardian for a minor child, * Preventing will contests, and * Making gifts to charities. When a person passes away, the person's will may be probated, meaning that a probate court will authorize a representative to carry out the deceased person's wishes. Depending upon where probate occurs, the representative may be called a personal representative, executor or administrator. ==References== Category:Death customs Category:Documents Category:Property law",
