The series is about three talking food items and their next door neighbor who live in New Jersey. In each 11 minute episode, the Aqua Teens often become part of some very unusual story that often involves one or more characters who often come on the show. The humor of the show is very unusual and some people do not understand it. ==Main characters== * Frylock is a large box of french fries who floats above the ground. He is very good at science and using computers. He is the smartest member of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force but the other members often do not listen to what he says. He is also very good at making new things like cloning machines and guns that shrink things. He also has several special powers, such as the ability to shoot harmful bolts of energy. * Master Shake is a large plastic cup with yellow rubber gloves for hands. He is very sarcastic and is not as smart as he thinks he is. He is the character that causes problems for the group most often and is also the character who dies the most. His only power is to shoot green goo out of the straw on his top. * Meatwad is a ball of meat who can change shape. He is the least intelligent of the Aqua Teens and is usually acts like a young child. Master Shake often does cruel things to him. Because of this, Meatwad is quick to do bad things to Master Shake whenever he has the chance. * Carl Brutananadilewski is the quick tempered, overweight, sarcastic, balding, hirsute neighbor of the Aqua Teens. He likes sports, pornography, and rock music (especially \"More Than an Feeling\" by Boston) which help him with masturbation which is his favorite activity.

He appears in almost every episode in the first two seasons in the cold openings, which involved him and his helper Steve doing random things. He and Steve will return in season 8. * Steve is Dr. Weird's helper who wears a lab coat and is usually seen staring or holding a test tube.
