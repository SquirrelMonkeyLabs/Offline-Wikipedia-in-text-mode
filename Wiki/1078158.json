 "text": "The Lanjak bush frog (Philautus refugii) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia. People have seen it in two places, one 840 meters above sea level and one between 900 and 1490 meters above sea level. This frog is in some danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives to get wood to build with and make farms to grow palm oil. The adult male frog is about 18-22 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female is about 18-20 mm long. People have seen this frog sitting on shrub plants. Male frogs sit about 2 meters above the ground and sing to the female frogs. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
