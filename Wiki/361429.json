The center was named after Governor James R. Thompson in 1993. It opened in 1985. It is located in Chicago, Illinois. In 2015, and again in 2017, Governor Bruce Rauner also proposed selling the property, and a legislative committee to explore his request was announced by Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan in February 2017. On February 13, 2018, Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauer was shot and killed by Shomari Legghetti, while Bauer was perusing a suspected outside of the Thompson Center. ==References== ==Other websites== * Commerce, Culture, & State Offices Under Glass * Commerce, Culture, & State Offices Under Glass * James R.
