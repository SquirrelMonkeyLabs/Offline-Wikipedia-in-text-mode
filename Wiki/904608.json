 "text": "Boones Creek is an unincorporated community and neighborhood of Johnson City, in north Washington County, Tennessee. Almost all of Boones Creek has been annexed by Johnson City and has become a neighborhood of Johnson City. Much of it has the postal addresses of Gray, Tennessee. It follows Boone's Creek and other tributaries of Boone Lake. It is a part of the Tri-Cities area. ==History== The community was the first permanent European settlement in Tennessee. It was named for the creek that runs through it. The creek is named for pioneer Daniel Boone. In the center of Boones Creek is a historic marker that tells the origins of the community's name. Daniel Boone was a frontiersman and hunted over large areas of the early frontier lands. On one of these hunting trips, he was chased by the local Indians. He hid under a waterfall on Boones Creek, now called Boone Falls, from Indians to avoid their displeasure at him hunting on their lands. There was also a historic tree nearby. A beech tree once stood with \"D Boon cilled a bar on tree in the year 1760\" etched on it. This tree was featured in the film \"Sergeant York\" when Alvin York (WWI hero) was trying to earn money by hunting and selling pelts. A large piece of the tree is now in the Boones Creek Historical Trust Museum and Opry. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Tennessee Category:Tri-Cities, Tennessee Category:Washington County, Tennessee",
