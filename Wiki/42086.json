 "text": "Henry III (1 October 1207 â€” 16 November 1272), also known as Henry of Winchester and nicknamed the Pious, the Wise and later the Saint. was the King of England from 1216 until his death in 1272. He was considered one of England's best kings. His long and mostly-successful 56-year reign was the longest in mediaeval English history. Throughout his reign, England would experience peace, stability and prosperity. Henry was extremely helpful, pious, and religious. He helped the poor people in England. He upgraded Westminster Abbey and reisssued Magna Carta. However in 1258, Henry became unpopular, as the barons forced him to give up some of his power to them. In 1263, Simon de Montfort, a baron who was Henry's brother-in-law by he married one of Henry's sisters, defeated and imprisoned him and became the disputed ruler of the country. However, Henry, with the help of his son, Crown Prince Edward, managed to escape captivity, and Montfort was killed. Henry regained his powers from the barons, which made him popular again. However, in 1264, the barons rebelled against him and started the Second Barons' War. However, Henry defeated the barons again in 1267. Henry continued to be helpful, pious and religious by continuing to help the poor. He continued to rebuild Westminster Abbey and to improve life and health care in England. In early 1272, Henry's health started to decline, and in November of that year, he died at the age of 65. He was buried at Westminster Abbey. Because Henry was such a religious person, he was canonized only two months after his death on 26 February 1273 by Pope Gregory X. Many historians view Henry as a weak but great king.
