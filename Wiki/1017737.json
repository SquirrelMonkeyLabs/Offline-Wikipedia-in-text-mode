 "text": "The Burmese camouflaged tree frog, Burmese warty tree frog or Burmese bug-eyed frog (Theloderma pyaukkya) is a frog. It lives in China and western Myanmar. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 28.0 to 31.5 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is creamy or white in color. There are dark brown marks near its eyes. The toes of the front feet are red in color with tiny gold marks. ==Name== Scientists named this frog pyaukkya after the Burmese language word for \"camouflage.\" This is because the frog's colors make it hard to see. ==Home== This frog lives in forests on hills and mountains. Scientists do not know how this frog lays eggs because they have not seen it, but they think it probably lays eggs in water-filled holes in trees because that is what other frogs in Theloderma do. People have seen this frog between 266 and 1338 meters above sea level. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place, but it is in some danger. Human beings cut down many trees to build farms. The frog's home has many protected parks in it, for example Indawgyi Wildlife Sanctuary. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
