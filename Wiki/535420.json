 "text": "A judicial opinion is a form of legal opinion written by a judge or a panel of judges explaining how they resolved a legal dispute. It cites the decision reached to resolve the dispute. A judicial opinion usually includes the reasons behind the decision. Where there are three or more judges, it may take the form of a majority opinion, minority opinion or a concurring opinion. ==Kinds of judicial opinions== * A majority opinion is a judicial opinion agreed to by more than half of the members of a court. A majority opinion sets becomes the decision of the court in a particular case. * A concurring opinion is written to agree with a decision, but for giving different reasons for the agreement. When it is joined by the greatest number of judges, it is referred to as the plurality opinion. * A dissenting opinion (or dissent) is an opinion written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. == References == Category:Law",
