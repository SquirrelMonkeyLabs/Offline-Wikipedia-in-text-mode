 "text": "Wearing underwear as outerwear is a fashion trend. Celebrities, sports and media made it popular. It began as a practical and comfortable variation of clothing, such as the T-shirt and the sleeveless shirt. Later, this lead to fashion statements that were seen as controversial and provocative. 21st century versions include the display of thongs and bras in women's clothing, and the display of underpants under low-slung pants in men. The idea of wearing underwear as outerwear is not new. The display of undergarments was already popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. == References == Category:Clothing controversies",
