 "text": "The Slave Craton is an Archaean craton in the north-western Canadian Shield, in Northwest Territories and Nunavut. It has some of the oldest rocks on Earth. Bleeker W; Davis B; Ketchum J; Stern R; Sircombe K; Waldron J. 2004. The Slave Craton from on top: the crustal view. Geological Survey of Canada. It has ~2.73â€“2.63 Ga (billion years-old) greenstones and turbidite sequences. These are the geologic deposits of a turbidity current. This type of gravity flow put vast amounts of clastic sediment into the deep ocean. Large parts of the craton are underlain by even older gneiss and granitoid units. == References == Category:Geology of Canada Category:Geological formations",
