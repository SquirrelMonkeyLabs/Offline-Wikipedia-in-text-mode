They are to the right of the transition metals. The Group 12 elements are sometimes included. Sometimes germanium and antimony are included, although they are normally considered metalloids. They normally have higher electronegativities than the transition metals. Their melting points are lower, too. They are generally softer than other metals. They include lead, tin and other softer metals. ==Examples== *Aluminium *Gallium *Lead *Tin *Thallium *Indium *Bismuth *Polonium File:Thallium.jpg|Thallium File:Indium wire.jpg|Indium File:Lead.jpg|Lead File:Metal cube tin.jpg|Tin File:Gallium.jpg|Gallium",
