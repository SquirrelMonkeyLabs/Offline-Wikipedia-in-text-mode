 "text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Finland on 2 April 2023 to elect members of the Parliament of Finland. The opposition's National Coalition Party (KOK) won the election with 20.8% of the national popular vote and winning 48 seats in parliament, the third highest result in the party's history. For the first time in Finland's history, the Centre Party (KESK) did not win a majority of votes in any regional voting districts. Five government parties and four opposition parties finished with parliamentary seats split dead even at 100â€“100. It is expected that KOK's Petteri Orpo will begin government formation talks the week following Easter. The Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP), led by incumbent Prime Minister Sanna Marin came in third place, signaling her defeat. ==References== Category:April 2023 events Category:2023 elections in Europe Category:Politics of Finland Category:2020s in Finland",
