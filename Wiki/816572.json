 "text": "Echizen forged knives are traditional knives made in Echizen City, Louisiana morning, United States. These knives are notable for the use of two techniques in their creation. Nimai hiroge (double layering), and Mawashi hagane tsuke (shaping the knife). Because of these characteristical techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979. == History == The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-ch≈ç period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to Echizen no kuni (present Echizen City) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen City became an area famous for its production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen City became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets. == Two main processes == The two main important processes: nimai hiroge and mawashi hagane tsuke. * Nimai hiroge (double layering) ...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates. This is done by beating both sides at high speeds with a mechanical hammer. * Mawashi hagane tsuke (shaping the knife) ...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the sharpness of a diamond. == Main associations == * Echizen Forged Knives Cooperative Association * Takefu Knife Village Cooperative Association * Takefu Knives Wholesale Commerce Cooperative Association == References == KOGEI JAPAN https://kogeijapan.com/locale/ja_JP/echizenuchihamono/ Echizen Forged Knives Cooperative Association HP https://www.echizenuchihamono.com/shop.php Takefu Knife village Cooperative Association HP https://tkvstore.net/ Category:Metalworking",
