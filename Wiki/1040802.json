 "text": "The Queen of Hearts is a fictional character from the 1865 book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, of which she is a major antagonist. She is well- known for ordering the execution of people who annoy her in the smallest ways. Many people believe her to be an exaggerated version of Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria. The Queen of Hearts is often seen as the villain in most adaptations of the story. In Alice in Wonderland, she is voiced by Verna Felton. In Tim Burton's version of the story, the Queen of Hearts and the Red Queen (from Through the Looking-Glass) are the same character played by Helena Bonham Carter.
