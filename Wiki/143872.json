Michael has played an important part in shaping the drumming characteristics of this genre. The first album he recorded was Prayers of Steel with the band Avenger (the band would later change their name to Rage). By the middle of the 1980s, he no longer worked with just one band, but worked as a studio session drummer. Because of this, he has been a part of many different bands and albums.
