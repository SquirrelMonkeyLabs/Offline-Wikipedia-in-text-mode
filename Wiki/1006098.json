 "text": "The Louisville Bats are a Minor League Baseball team from Louisville, Kentucky. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Bats are partnered with the Cincinnati Reds, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Reds. The team is named \"Bats\" because Louisville is famous for making a baseball bat called the Louisville Slugger. The team's logo uses a baseball bat and the animal called a bat. Their name was the Louisville Redbirds from 1982 to 1998 and Louisville RiverBats from 1999 to 2001. They became the Bats in 2002. The Bats played at a stadium called Cardinal Stadium from 1982 to 1999. In 2000, the Bats began to play at a new stadium called Louisville Slugger Field. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1980s establishments in the United States Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Cincinnati Reds Category:Louisville, Kentucky",
