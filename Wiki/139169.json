 "text": "King Louie is a fictional orangutan who kidnaps Mowgli in Disney's 1967 animated musical adaptation of The Jungle Book. He was played by Louis Prima. He does not appear in Rudyard Kipling's original book, as orangutans are not native to India. But the movie is \"inspired by\" rather than \"based on\" the Kipling stories. King Louie has been called an example of a racial stereotype in Disney movies. ==Spin-Offs== King Louie was played by Jim Cummings in TaleSpin and Jungle Cubs. ==Remakes== In The Jungle Book (1994 film) King Louie was played by a real orangutan. In The Jungle Book (2016 film), King Louie was played by Christopher Walken. ==Footnotes== == References == Category:Disney characters",
