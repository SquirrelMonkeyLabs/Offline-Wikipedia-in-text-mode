He has been President of the Independent Chinese PEN Center since 2003. On 8 December 2008, police stopped Liu and held him because of his work with Charter 08. He was not actually arrested until 23 June 2009. The government accused him of encouraging people to turn against the state.Benjamin Kang Lim, China's top dissident arrested for subversion, Reuters, 24 June 2009.\"刘晓波因涉嫌煽动颠覆国家政权罪被依法逮捕 \" (Liu Xiaobo Formally Arrested on 'Suspicion of Inciting Subversion of State Power' Charges), China Review News, 24 June 2009. He had a trial on 23 December 2009. On 25 December 2009, the court decided he must go to prison for eleven years. The court also took away his political rights for two years. He won the Nobel Peace Prize on 8 October 2010, for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\" This was during the fourth time Liu was in prison.McKinnon, Mark. \"Liu Xiaobo could win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he’d be the last to know\" . The Globe and Mail. 7 October 2010. 'Ms. Liu said her husband had been told by his lawyer during a recent visit that he had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, but he would be shocked if he won, she said. “I think he would definitely find it hard to believe. He never thought of being nominated, he never mentioned any awards. For so many years, he has been calling for people to back the Tiananmen Mothers (a support group formed by parents of students killed in the 1989 demonstrations)..”' He is the first Chinese person to win a Nobel Prize while living in China. He is also the third person to win the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention. The others were Germany's Carl von Ossietzky in 1935 and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991. On 26 June 2017, he was granted medical parole after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He died a few weeks later on 13 July 2017. ==Early life and education== Liu was born in 1955 in Changchun, Jilin to an intellectual family. His father took him to the Inner Mongolia from 1969 to 1973 during the Down to the Countryside Movement. He worked in a village in Jilin province when he was 19 years old. He worked at a construction company after that. In 1976, he studied at Jilin University and got a B.A. degree in literature in 1982. He earned an M.A. degree in 1984 from Beijing Normal University. Liu joined the faculty at Beijing Normal University after he graduated. He also received a Ph.D. degree there in 1988. In the 1980s, his most important essays, Critique on Choices - Dialogue with Le Zehou and Aesthetics and Human Freedom' earned him fame in the academic field. The essay criticised a prominent Chinese thinker Li Zehou's philosophy. Between 1988 and 1989, he was a visiting scholar at several universities outside of China, including Columbia University, the University of Oslo and the University of Hawaii. During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests he was in the United States but decided to go back to China to join the movement. He was later named as one of the \"Four Junzis of Tiananman Square\" by many Hong Kong- and Taiwan-based Chinese media. ==Human rights activities== Liu Xiaobo works to increase human rights. He has asked the Chinese government to be more open and honest about its actions. The Chinese government has brought him to police stations, arrested him, and sent him to prison many times for his peaceful political activities. The first time was for his actions in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Organizations outside China have noticed Liu's human rights work and given him awards. In 2004, Reporters Without Borders honored Liu's human rights work, awarding him the Fondation de France Prize as a defender of press freedom.Reporters Without Borders, \"Fondation de France Prize: Liu Xiaobo Receives Prize for Defence of Press Freedom,\" 21 December 2004. ==Time in prison== In January 1991, Liu Xiaobo was convicted of \"counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.\" However, the government did not give him any punishment as a criminal. In October 1996, he was ordered to serve three years of labour for \"disturbing public order\"Liu Xiaobo, \"劉曉波：勞教 早該被廢除的惡法\" (Reeducation-through-labor: An evil law which should be quickly repealed), Observe China, 6 December 2007. by criticizing the Communist Party of China.Wang Ming, \"A Citizen's Declaration on Freedom of Speech ,\" China Rights Forum (spring 1997).

While Liu was kept alone in solitary confinement, he was not allowed to meet with his lawyer or family. He was allowed to eat lunch with his wife, Liu Xia, and two policemen on New Year's Day 2009.\"Writers Call for China Dissident's Release,\" Reuters, 9 December 2008. On 23 June 2009, an officer of the government in Beijing (the procuratorate) approved Liu Xiaobo's arrest on charges of \"suspicion of inciting subversion of state power.\" This is a crime under Article 105 of the Law of the People's Republic of China.中华人民共和国刑法 (Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China) The Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) said in a press release that Liu had incited the subversion of state power and the overturn of the socialist system through methods such as spreading rumors and slander, using almost the exact words of Article 105. The Beijing PSB also said that Liu had \"fully confessed.\" ===Trial=== On 1 December 2009, Beijing police transferred Liu's case to the procuratorate for investigation and processing;Canghai [沧海], \"刘晓波案闪电移送法院 律师两次前往未能会见\" [Liu Xiaobo's Case Quickly Escalated to the Court; Lawyers Twice Try to Meet with Liu to No Avail], Canyu [参与], 11 December 2009. on 10 December, the procuratorate formally indicted Liu on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and sent his lawyers, Shang Baojun and Ding Xikui, the indictment document.

(2009) yi zhong xing chu zi 3901, unofficial English translation in Human Rights in China, \"International Community Speaks Out on Liu Xiaobo Verdict ,\" 30 December 2009. The court said that Charter 08 was part of the evidence supporting his conviction. ===International response=== Many individuals, states, and organizations around the world asked the Chinese government to release Liu. The Chinese government said no and told people outside China not to become involved. On 11 December 2008, the United States Department of State called for Liu's release. On 22 December 2008, an organization of scholars, writers, lawyers, and human rights workers wrote an open letter to ask the government to let Liu out of prison.\"Letter from the Consortium for the Release of Liu Xiaobo to China's President Hu Jintao,\" 22 December 2008. On 21 January 2009, 300 international writers, including Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Ha Jin and Jung Chang, called for Liu's release in a statement put out through PEN. In March 2009 Liu Xiaobo was awarded with the Homo Homini Award by the One World Film Festival, organized by the People in Need foundation, for promoting freedom of speech, democratic principles and human rights. In December 2009, the European Union and United States both officially asked the Chinese government to release of Liu Xiaobo without any special rules or conditions. Before the court decision, China said that other nations should \"respect China's judicial sovereignty and to not do things that will interfere in China's internal affairs.\" Responding to the result in court, United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Navanethem Pillay expressed concern political rights in China becoming worse. German Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticized the verdict, stating \"despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views, I regret that the Chinese government still massively restricts press freedom.\" Canada and Switzerland also condemned the verdict. Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou called on Beijing to \"tolerate dissent\". On 6 January 2010, former Czech president Václav Havel joined with other communist-era dissidents at the Chinese embassy in Prague to present a petition calling for Liu's release. On 22 January 2010, European Association for Chinese Studies sent an open letter to Hu Jintao on behalf of over 800 scholars from 36 countries calling for Liu's release. ==Nobel Peace Prize== ===Events leading up to the prize=== On 18 January 2010, Liu was named by many people as a nominee (possible winner) of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. These included Václav Havel, the 14th Dalai Lama, André Glucksmann, Vartan Gregorian, and Desmond Tutu. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said that awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu would be \"totally wrong\". Geir Lundestad, a secretary of the Nobel Committee, stated the award would not be influenced by Beijing's opposition. On 25 September 2010, The New York Times reported that a petition in support of the Nobel nomination was being circulated in China.\"Petition Urges Nobel for Jailed Chinese Writer\" article by Andrew Jacobs in The New York Times 25 September 2010. Retrieved 25 September 2010. In September 2010 Václav Havel, Dana Němcová, and Václav Malý published an open letter in The International Herald Tribune calling for the award to be given to Liu. All three had been leaders of Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution. Soon after, people began signing a petition.\"A Nobel Prize for a Chinese Dissident\". The New York Times. 20 September 2010. Freedom Now is a non-governmental organization and works as a lawyer for Liu Xiaobo outside China. On 6 October 2010, they publicly released a letter from 30 U.S. Members of Congress to President Barack Obama (the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner). This letter strongly asked President Obama to talk directly to Chinese President Hu Jintao at the G-20 Summit in November 2010. They wanted Obama to talk about Liu Xiaobo and another political prisoner named Gao Zhisheng . ===Prize announcement=== On 8 October 2010 the Nobel Committee awarded Liu the Prize \"for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee president Thorbjørn Jagland said the choice of Liu as the recipient of the prize had become clear early on in the process. The Chinese foreign ministry had already warned the Nobel committee not to give Liu the prize. They said that it would be against Nobel principles. All news about the announcement of the award was immediately censored in China. Foreign news broadcasters including CNN and the BBC were immediately blocked after mentioning the award in China. Web searches for Liu Xiabo were immediately deleted and no information can be searched about him in China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that said, \"The Nobel Peace Prize is meant to award individuals who promote international harmony and friendship, peace and disarmament. Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who has been sentenced by Chinese judicial departments for violating Chinese law. Awarding the peace to Liu runs completely counter to the principle of the award and is also a desecration of the Peace Prize.\" The state-run Xinhua News Agency later carried a report saying that awarding Liu Xiaobo the prize “defiles” (亵渎) Alfred Nobel's purpose of creating this prize and \"may harm China-Norway relations\". The spokesperson added that Liu had broken Chinese law and his \"actions run contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize.\" ===Responses from world leaders=== Many world leaders congratulated Liu for the award. These included Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, The British Foreign Secretary William Hague, US President Barack Obama, and The Dalai Lama. ===Official Chinese government response=== The Chinese Foreign Ministry called the Norwegian ambassador to the People's Republic of China to the ministry on 8 October 2010. The Chinese gave the ambassador an official complaint against awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo. The Norwegian foreign minister replied that the Chinese government complaint was not needed because the group of people who decide the Nobel Prize is independent from the Norwegian government. However, the Norwegian Nobel Committee that gives the peace prize is appointed by the Norwegian parliament. ==Major publications== * Original title:《选择的批判——与李泽厚对话》, published by 上海人民出版社 * Original title: 《审美与人的自由》, published by 北京師范大學出版社 Beijing Normal University Publishing. * Original title:《形而上学的迷雾》, by 上海人民出版社 Shanghai's People publishing. * Original title: 《赤身裸体，走向上帝》, 时代文艺出版社 Times Literature and Art Publisher. * Original title:《末日幸存者的独白》, published by 台湾時報出版 Taiwan Times Publishing. * Original title:《中国当代政治与中国知识份子》, published by 台北唐山出版社 Taiwan Tangshan Publishing. * 《刘晓波刘霞诗选》, published by 香港夏菲尔国际出版公司 Hong Kong Xiafeier International Publishing Ltd. * * Original title: 《向良心说谎的民族》, published by 捷幼出版社 Jieyou Publishing. * Original title:《未来的自由中国在民间》, published by 劳改基金会 Labor Reform Foundation. * Original title:《单刃毒剑——中国当代民族主义批判》, published by 博大出版社 Boda Publishing. * Yunchen Culture publisher. ==Awards== * Hellman-Hammett Grant (1990, 1996) * China Foundation on Democracy Education (2003): Outstanding Democratic Activist * Fondation de France Prize (2004): Award for Defending Freedom of Speech * Hong Kong Human Rights Press Awards (2004, 2005, 2006) * Homo Homini Award (2009)One World Homo Homini award goes to Chinese dissident，2009年3月12日. * PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award (2009) * Hermann Kesten Award (2010)Liu Xiaobo De-World, 7 October 2010. * Nobel Peace Prize (2010) ==Personal life== He is married to Liu Xia, who lives in the couple's apartment in Beijing. ===Health and death=== In May 2017, Liu was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.\"China releases terminally ill Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo\".
