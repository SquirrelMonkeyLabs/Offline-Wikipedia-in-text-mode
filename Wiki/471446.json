Once he got there, he was forced to wait for a long time. Then he found out the appointment had been cancelled. Heo Mok angrily stated \"bojihwayangdong buralsongseonsaeng\". In Classical Chinese, the statement means \"Walked to Hwayang-dong; did not see teacher Song\", but in native Korean, boji () refers to \"female genitals\", while bural () means \"testicles\", making the expression additionally mean \"cunt Hwayang-dong; testicles teacher Song\". ==References== ==Sources== * 정운채, 강미정 외, 문학치료 서사사전 2:설화편(서사와문학치료연구소 문학치료총서 3) (문학과 치료, 2009년) ==Other websites== * 송 정승과 허 정승에 얽힌 화양동 일화:향토문화자원 \"Folk Cultural Resources: The Tangled Anecdote of Minister Song and Minister Heo at Hwayang-dong\" * 화양구곡과 우암 송시열 \"Hwayang Gugok and Song Si-yeol\" Category:History of Korea Category:Figures of speech",
