 "text": "The inauguration of Herbert Hoover as the 31st president of the United States happened on March 4, 1929. It was the start of the only term of Herbert Hoover as president and Charles Curtis as vice president. A public ceremony happened on the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 36th presidential inauguration. This was the first inauguration to be recorded by sound newsreels. It was also the second inauguration in which a former president gave the oath of office to a new president. Chief Justice and former President William Howard Taft administered the oath of office to Hoover. Charles G. Dawes administered the vice presidential oath of office to Curtis. During the oath taking for Hoover, Taft misspoke and said the phrase \"preserve, maintain, and defend,\" instead of \"preserve, protect, and defend\". A 13-year-old schoolgirl from Walden, New York, caught the error and wrote to the Chief Justice to tell him. ==References== ==Other websites== *Video of Hoover's Inauguration (Reel 1) (via YouTube) *Text of Hoover's Inaugural Address Category:1920s in the United States Category:Herbert Hoover Hoover, Herbert Category:March events Category:1929 in the United States",
