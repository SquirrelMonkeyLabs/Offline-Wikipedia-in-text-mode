 "text": "Scorpion I was a king of Upper Egypt during the Predynastic Period, or the period before egypt was united. His name may refer to the scorpion goddess Serket. He is believed to have ruled in Thinis one or two centuries before the rule of the better known King Scorpion II. To him belongs the U-j tomb found in the royal cemetery of Abydos where Thinite kings were buried. ==In contemporary fiction== *William Golding's novel The Scorpion God is loosely based upon this period of Egyptian history. *The 2001 adventure film The Mummy Returns features a fictionalized account of the \"Scorpion King\" of Egypt, a character who went on to have his own spin-off in the 2002 film, The Scorpion King.
