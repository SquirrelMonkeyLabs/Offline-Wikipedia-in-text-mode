 "text": "Shen Bao was a newspaper published in Shanghai, China. It was published between April 30, 1872 and May 27, 1949, making it the longest running for any newspaper in China. The name has also been transliterated as Shun Pao or Shen- pao. In English, the newspaper was usually called Shanghai News. The name is short for Shenjiang Xinbao. Shenjiang is a short form of Chunsheng jiang, the old name for the Huangpu River.Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A Manual, Revised and Enlarged (Harvard University Asia Center, 2000: ), p. 967. ==Establishment== The paper was started by Ernest Major (1841-1908),Dates from Roberta Wue, \"The Profits of Philanthropy: Relief Aid, Shenbao, and the Art World in Later Nineteenth-Century Shanghai,\" Late Imperial China 25 (June 2004), pp. 187-211. in 1872. Major was a British businessman. Shen Bao was one of the first modern Chinese newspapers. Major returned to England in 1899, and the newspaper was reorganised to be Major Company Limited. According to Zhou,Yongming Zhou, Historicizing Online Politics: Telegraphy, the Internet, and Political Participation in China (Stanford University Press, 2006: ), p. 45. Major made it clear that the newspaper would be for Chinese readers, and not for foreigners. He therefore picked those news and issues that would be interesting to Chinese. Secondly, he made Chinese compradors responsible for running the business and he had Chinese editors select the news and write the editorials. He was very successful: The Chinese compradors used their ties with the community, raised the circulation, and obtained advertisements. This made the paper cheaper than those of the competition. The Chinese editors knew what their readers wanted to read about. ==Roles== Shen Bao played an important role and helped form public opinion at the end of the 19th century. The paper ran a campaign against hiring young women as waitresses in opium dens. According to the campaign these women would also provide sex services in the dens. Most of the dens with this practice were in the French Concession. The campaign said that one of the reasons this problem existed was that there were foreigners in Shanghai.Paraphrased from Thou:Historizing politics, p. 50 There was an uproar, and the practice was banned; in reality little was done to stop it. The newspaper was innovative: It used new printing technologies, sent a military correspondent to cover the Sino-French War in Vietnam in 1884 and used vernacular (baihua)\"Wilkinson, Chinese History, p. 967. Quickly it got the reputation of being one of the best newspapers in China. It was bought by a Chinese in 1909.Wilkinson, Chinese History, p. 968. In the early 20th century it had a circulation of 30.000 copies a day. 9.000 in Shanhai, and the rest was for other parts of China.Mary Ninde Gamewell, New Life Currents in China (Missionary Education Movement of the United States and Canada, 1919), pp. 162-163. \"By the early 1920s its circulation was 50,000; by the end of the decade 100,000; and by the mid 1930s, 150,000.\"Wilkinson, Chinese History, p. 995. ==Offices== The paper's offices were in the International Settlement, \"about a block away from the Central Police Station.\"Harriet Sergeant, Shanghai: Collision Point of Cultures 1918-1939 (Crown, 1991: ), p. 162. At first, the paper had eight pages, with news, essays, and advertisements as well as imperial decrees and memorials. \"Because the editorial policies followed the principle of 'reporting whatever possible and letting the readers determine the truth,' many interesting but unfounded rumors were often included as news.\" After 1905, it increased its size to twenty pages.Chinese History Research Site at UCSD , Miscellaneous Sources. ==History== Shen Bao was founded as a commercial newspaper. Politically, it was conservative for the first three decades and supported the Qing government. In 1905, it started to change. On New Year's Day it quoted Liang Qichao's constitutionalist slogans. In 1907, the paper was sold to Xi Zipei (1867-1929),Dates from Ellen Widmer, \"The Saoye shanfang of Suzhou and Shanghai: An Evolution in Five Stages\" [Word document]; Xi's name in Chinese is 希子佩. Xi Zipei used to be a comprador of the paper. Xi Zipei was influenced by Zhang Jian. The paper changed and became quite liberal and strongly supported the constitutional movement.Mary Clabaugh Wright, China in Revolution: The First Phase, 1900-1913 (Yale University Press, 1971: ), p. 157. \"It had the following sections: editorials, international news, domestic news, local news, industry and trade, law and society, sports and education, literature and art, and advertisements.

Soong Qing Ling was the second wife of revolutionary leader Dr Sun Yat-sen, with Cai Yuanpei and Lu Xun.\"Patsy Yang and Jolin Ng, \"Cheers for favorite old bars and some newbies in Tongren Road ,\" Shanghai Daily, July 13, 2009. In 1934, the newspaper made the government angry, because it had a strong attitude against the Japanese. \"On November 13, Shih Liang-ts'ai, its owner and editor-in-chief, was mysteriously assassinated on the Shanghai-Hangchow Highway\".Lee-hsia Hsu Ting, Government Control of the Press in Modern China, 1900-1949 (Harvard University Asia Center, 1975: ), p. 97.
