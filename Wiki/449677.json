 "text": "The Make-A-Wish Foundation is a non-profit organization. It helps children that have life-threatening medical conditions by arranging experiences known as \"wishes\". These might include going to a special place (like Disney World), meeting a famous person, or having a unique experience. As of 2022, Make-A- Wish had granted over 520,000 wishes for children around the world. The age limit is between 2 and a half and 18 at the time of referral. The child's physician decides if they are eligible. The organization is based in Phoenix, Arizona. David A. Williams is the President and CEO of Make-A-Wish America. Professional wrestler John Cena holds the record for granting the most wishes: over 450. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Charities of the United States",
