 "text": "Moosehead Lake is a large lake in Maine. It is the largest lake of Maine and the largest lake wholly within New England (the larger Lake Champlain is located between Vermont, New York, which is not considered part of New England, and the province of Quebec in Canada). It was named Moosehead Lake, because the lake's shape looks like a moose's head. There are over 80 islands in the lake, the largest being Sugar Island. ==Other websites== Category:Lakes of the United States Category:Geography of Maine",
