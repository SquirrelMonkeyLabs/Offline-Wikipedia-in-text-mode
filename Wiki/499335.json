It was named for the suburb of Balaclava, which in turn was named for a battlefield of the Crimean War. It included the wealthy inner southern suburbs of Melbourne, including Brighton and Sandringham. It was abolished and replaced by the Division of Goldstein in 1984. ==Members== Member Party Term Sir George Turner Protectionist 1901–1904 Free Trade 1904–1906 Agar Wynne Independent Protectionist 1906–1909 Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1914 William Watt Commonwealth Liberal 1914–1917 Nationalist 1917–1922 Liberal Union 1922–1925 Nationalist 1925–1929 Thomas White Nationalist 1929–1931 United Australia 1931–1944 Liberal 1944–1951 Percy Joske Liberal 1951–1960 Ray Whittorn Liberal 1960–1974 Ian Macphee Liberal 1974–1984 Thomas White, the Air and Civil Aviation Minister, resigned to become Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
