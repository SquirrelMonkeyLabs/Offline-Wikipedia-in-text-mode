 "text": "The Kandyan shrub frog (Pseudophilautus rus) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it between 500 and 800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 20.6 â€“ 24.1 mm from nose to rear end and adult female frog can be as big as 23.1 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color. It has dark black marks on the tops of its back legs. The area near the eardrum is dark brown with lighter brown marks. The eardrum is red-brown in color. The sides of the body are light brown and yellow in color. The webbed skin on the feet is dark brown in color. Like other frogs in Pseudophilautus, P. rus hatches out of its eggs as small frogs. They never swim as tadpoles. This frog is not endangered, but there are fewer of them than there were. Scientists think this is because human beings change the places where the frog lives to build cities and because of chemicals like pollution, chemicals to kill pests, and chemicals to make crops grow. The frog's scientific name, rus, comes from a Latin word that means \"countryside\" or \"farmland.\" This is because scientists found the frog in the countryside in Kandy. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
