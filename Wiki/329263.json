It was written during Bach's first year in Leipzig, Germany. Bach did not compose the melody. That was written by Johann Schop. Bach only harmonized and orchestrated Schop's melody. A transcription of \"Jesu\" was made by the English pianist Myra Hess (1890â€“1965), It was published in 1926 for piano solo. In 1934 the Hess version was adapted for piano duet. British organist Peter Hurford made a transcription of \"Jesu\" for organ. Today, Bach's piece is often performed at weddings and funerals. Bach wrote the piece for voices with trumpet, oboes, strings, and continuo. \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\" is one of Bach's most enduring pieces of music.
