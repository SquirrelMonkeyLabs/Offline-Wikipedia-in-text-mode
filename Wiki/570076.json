 "text": "Klootschieten (\"Ball shooting\" in English) is a sport played in the Netherlands and Frisia, Lower Saxony, Germany. In the game, players try to throw a ball (called a kloot) as far as they can. One version is played on frozen fields during the winter. A heavier ball is used when played on streets. A third version is played while standing still. The game is often played by teams of from three to five players. Two teams play at a time. Each team acts as the other's jury. == References == == Other websites == * Klootschieten in Ootmarsum; YouTube Category:Sport in Europe",
