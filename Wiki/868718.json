 "text": "TALENs were a kind of genetic engineering tool. They are restriction enzymes because they can cut specific sequences of DNA. They have a binding domain (strip of bases) and a cleavage domain. The letters stand for \"transcription activator-like effector nucleases\". The technique was called \"genome editing with engineered nucleases\". Together with zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN was for a while an important tool in genome editing.Boch J. 2011.
