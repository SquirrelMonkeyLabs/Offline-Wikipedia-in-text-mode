 "text": "Manuel Acuna Roxas (January 1, 1892 – April 15, 1948) was a Filipino politician. He was the President of the Philippine Commonwealth (1946) and the first President of the Third Philippine Republic (1946 - 1948). He was a Minister of the Philippine Commonwealth, Secretary of Finance (1938 – 1941) and Executive Secretary of Third Philippine Republic (1942). The Philippine Commonwealth was abolished after he was elected as President of the Third Philippine Republic. == Early life and career == Roxas was born in January 1892. After studying as a lawyer at the University of the Philippines, he started his career as a secretary to Judge Cayetano Arellano. He began his political career as councilor at Capiz, later on becoming governor in the province. He also became a speaker at congress. During this time, Roxas became co-chairman of the OsRox mission together with Sergio Osmeña and achieved the Hare Hawes Cutting Independence Act of 1933. This act promised to grant Philippine independence after 10 years but because of threats on imposed tariffs, especially in agriculture, it was highly debated on American and Filipino congress. In the end, it was decided that Philippine independence is only possible if the Philippines accept to keep U.S. military bases, a decision rejected by the Philippine Congress. ==Presidency== Because of World War II, the Philippines had a difficult time rehabilitating its economy. After he was elected president, Roxas established the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, which helped many Filipinos who lost their homes, and helped create the Central Bank of the Philippines, which funded the lack of food supply in the country. The creation of the central bank was not fully implemented until President Elpidio Quirino's term. He also requested help from the United States under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act and the Tydings Rehabilitation Act. This was used in turn to fix damaged roads, bridges, and buildings. In consequence for receiving rehabilitation funds from the U.S., Roxas was forced to accept the preconditioned Philippine Trade Act or Bell Trade Act of 1946. He was also forced to sign the Military Bases Agreement which proposed to keep 23 military bases of the United States under 99 years inside the country. Despite his efforts of rehabilitation, the Roxas administration was known for its corruption, rise of unemployment, and failure of land policies that led to the outbreak of the Hukbalahap rebellion. == Death == His presidency ended when he died on April 15,1948 while delivering a speech at the Clark Air Force Base because of a heart attack. His vice president, Elpidio Quirino, became president. ==References== == Other websites == * The Philippine Presidency Project * A Country Study: Philippines * Manuel A.
