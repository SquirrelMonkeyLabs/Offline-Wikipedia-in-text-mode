 "text": "Ariadne, in Greek mythology, was daughter of King Minos of Crete and his queen, PasiphaÃ«, daughter of Helios, the Sun-titan. She helped Theseus in defeating the Minotaur (by giving him a length of string to escape the labyrinth). But Theseus abandoned her so she became the consort of the god Dionysus. She is the Greek goddess of Paths and Labyrinths. ==Related pages== *43 Ariadne Category:People in Greek mythology",
