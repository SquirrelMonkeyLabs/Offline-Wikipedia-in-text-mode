 "text": "Pringles is an American brand of stackable potato chips. It was first made by Procter & Gamble in 1967. The brand was sold to Kellogg's in 2012. As of 2011, Pringles are sold in more than 140 countries. Pringles are known for their packaging, which is made up of a cardboard tube with a plastic lid on top. It is also known for the logo, which has a drawing of a man with a large mustache. The shape of the chips themselves are a special shape called a hyperbolic paraboloid, so if you look at it from the side it can look like it curves up, but looking at it from another side makes it curve down. ==References== Category:Snack foods",
