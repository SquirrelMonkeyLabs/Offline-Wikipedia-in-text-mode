 "text": "Donald Campbell (March 23, 1921 â€“ January 4, 1967) was a British world record holder who died trying to break the world record of becoming the fastest man on water in 1967. On 4 January that year, his jet powered boat lifted into the air, and was slammed back into the water with so much force, that Campbell died immediately, but his body was not found until 34 years later. Many people have predicted that the crash would not have happened, and was a result of the boat being too light due to a lack of fuel.
