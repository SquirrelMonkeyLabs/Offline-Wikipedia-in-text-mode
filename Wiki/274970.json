 "text": "Lee Joseph Fogolin (born February 7, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois and raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario), is a retired defenceman who played in the National Hockey League. He played for the Buffalo Sabres and the Edmonton Oilers, playing in 924 NHL regular season games between 1974 and 1987, winning the Stanley Cup in 1984 and 1985. ==Background and early career== Fogolin was born in Chicago while his father, Lee Fogolin Sr., was a member of the Chicago Blackhawks. His son, Michael Fogolin, played for the Prince George Cougars in the WHL and died in his sleep on May 26, 2004 of a possible heart condition. Fogolin played from 1972–1974 with the Oshawa Generals of the OHA, scoring 52 points in 102 games with 240 PIM. He was drafted in the first round, 11th overall, of the 1974 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres. Although Fogolin was raised in Canada, he was chosen to play for Team USA in the 1976 Canada Cup, since he was born in the U.S.. He was invited again in 1984, but this time chose not to play. ==NHL playing career== Fogolin played his first professional season (1974–75) in Buffalo, but played parts of the next season with the Sabres and the AHL Hershey Bears. He was acquired by the Edmonton Oilers for the 1979–1980 season. Fogolin played seven full seasons with Edmonton, and was named as captain for the 1981–82 season. He would be the first of four captains to lead the Oilers to the Stanley Cup finals, in 1983, where they lost to the New York Islanders. While a solid defenceman in his own right, he was overshadowed by many of the young stars on the Oilers' roster, most notably scoring superstar Wayne Gretzky. Fogolin gave up the captaincy to Gretzky for the 1983–84 season onwards. Fogolin was a member of the Oilers' Stanley Cup wins in 1984 and 1985. Fogolin also played in the 1986 National Hockey League All-Star Game. Fogolin was re-acquired by the Sabres near the end of the 1986–87 season, and retired after completing the season with them. ==Awards and achievements== *1983–84 - NHL - Stanley Cup (Edmonton) *1984–85 - NHL - Stanley Cup (Edmonton) *1985–86 - National Hockey League All-Star Game ==Career statistics== Regular Season Regular Season Regular Season Regular Season Regular Season Playoffs Playoffs Playoffs Playoffs Playoffs Season Team Lge GP G A pts PIM GP G A pts PIM 1972-73 Oshawa Generals OHA 55 5 21 26 132 1973-74 Oshawa Generals OHA 47 7 19 26 108 1974-75 Buffalo Sabres NHL 50 2 2 4 59 8 0 0 0 6 1975-76 Hershey Bears AHL 20 1 8 9 61 -- -- -- -- -- 1975-76 Buffalo Sabres NHL 58 0 9 9 64 9 0 4 4 23 1976-77 Buffalo Sabres NHL 71 3 15 18 100 4 0 0 0 2 1977-78 Buffalo Sabres NHL 76 0 23 23 98 6 0 2 2 23 1978-79 Buffalo Sabres NHL 74 3 19 22 103 3 0 0 0 4 1979-80 Edmonton Oilers NHL 80 5 10 15 104 3 0 0 0 4 1980-81 Edmonton Oilers NHL 80 13 17 30 139 9 0 0 0 12 1981-82 Edmonton Oilers NHL 80 4 25 29 154 5 1 1 2 14 1982-83 Edmonton Oilers NHL 72 0 18 18 92 16 0 5 5 36 1983-84 Edmonton Oilers NHL 80 5 16 21 125 19 1 4 5 23 1984-85 Edmonton Oilers NHL 79 4 14 18 126 18 3 1 4 16 1985-86 Edmonton Oilers NHL 80 4 22 26 129 8 0 2 2 10 1986-87 Edmonton Oilers NHL 35 1 3 4 17 -- -- -- -- -- 1986-87 Buffalo Sabres NHL 9 0 2 2 8 -- -- -- -- -- NHL Totals NHL Totals NHL Totals 924 44 195 239 1318 108 5 19 24 173 ==Other websites== * *Oilers Heritage biography. *Fogolin's profile at hockeydraftcentral.com * Category:1955 births Category:American ice hockey defensemen Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Edmonton Oilers players Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Ontario Hockey League players",
