 "text": "The 2000 UEFA Cup Final Riots, also known as the Battle of Copenhagen, was a riot in City Hall Square in Copenhagen, Denmark, between fans of English football team Arsenal and Turkish side Galatasaray around the 2000 UEFA Cup Final on 17 May 2000. The fights, in which four people were stabbed, also included fans from other clubs and were viewed by the media as part of revenge attacks for the killing of two Leeds United fans by Galatasaray fans the month before. ==References== Category:2000 in association football Category:2000s crimes in Europe Category:Riots in Europe Category:UEFA Category:21st century in Copenhagen Category:2000 in Europe Category:2000 in Denmark Category:2000 crimes",
