 "text": "The January 20–22, 2025 Gulf Coast blizzard was a strong winter storm and blizzard that impacted the Gulf Coast of the United States. It brought snowfall to parts of the Gulf Coast that see very little snow. This was the first recorded blizzard on the Gulf Coast and the most significant winter storm in the region since 1895. The storm was unofficially nicknamed Winter Storm Enzo by The Weather Channel. Due to the threat of heavy snowfall in cities such as New Orleans, Houston, and Pensacola, states of emergencies were declared in almost every state along the Gulf Coast. The storm became stronger on January 21 and a blizzard warning was issued for the coastline of Louisiana. Thousands of airline flights were postponed or cancelled across the Gulf Coast because of the storm. The height of snowfall ranged from across the coast, and the states of Louisiana and Florida recorded their largest single- day snowfall across the state. At least 77,000 people lost power due to the storm, with most of the outages being reported in Louisiana and Florida. At least 13 people have been killed as a result of the storm. Financial losses are said to be at least US$500 million. Parts of the blizzard eventually crossed the Atlantic Ocean and developed into Storm Éowyn, which brought historic impacts to Ireland and the United Kingdom. ==References== Category:January 2025 events Category:2025 in the United States",
