 "text": "The New American Poetry 1945–1960 is a book of poems by many new and different poets of that time. It was edited by Donald Allen and put out by Grove Press in 1960. In 1999 it came out again from University of California Press with a new afterword. Many readers think the book is very important in the history of American poetry after World War II. Many of the included poets had long careers after the book came out. Many of their ideas about how to write poetry became popular with even younger poets. In 1982 the book was made bigger and published as The Postmoderns: The New American Poetry Revised edited by Donald Allen and George Butterick.
