 "text": "Montserrat is a Caribbean island and a British Overseas Territory. Its governor is Deborah Barnes-Jones. Officially, the capital is Plymouth, but the government has moved to Brades after Chances Peak erupted, destroying Plymouth in 1995. Before the island was called Montserrat, Kalinago and Ta√≠no people had lived in the region for a long time. They knew it as Alliouagana. Montserrat was colonised mostly by Irish Catholics. They brought many black slaves to the island and forced them to work on sugar plantations. The work the slaves made many plantations grow wealthy. When slavery was made illegal in the 1830s, the British Empire paid all the slave owners. == References == Category:Caribbean Community",
