The woman tries to force Johnny to live his life as if he actually were a walrus because people on the Internet tell her that she’s a bad person if she doesn’t. She is eventually convinced by a zookeeper that he is a human, not an animal and that she should ignore what the Internet people say. Walsh has said that the book is an allegory for the issue of transgender children. Category:American children's books Category:2020s books",
