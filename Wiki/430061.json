 "text": "Black start is the process to start up in a power station from zero, without the help of power from the grid connected to the station. Usually, a power station uses its own set of electrical generator to start the plant. This is a diesel generator called the Black start diesel generator (BSDG). This powers up all electrical panels which control the station. Category:Electricity",
