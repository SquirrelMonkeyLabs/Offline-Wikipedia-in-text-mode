 "text": "The San Francisco Giants are a Major League Baseball team in San Francisco, California. They were founded in 1883, and have been in San Francisco since 1958. They are in the West Division of National League in baseball. The Giants play at Oracle Park. They have been playing there since 2000 when it opened as Pacific Bell Park. The Giants have won eight World Series championship titles. They most recently won the World Series in 2014, defeating the Kansas City Royals in seven games. It was their third win in five years after beating the Texas Rangers and the Detroit Tigers in 2010 and 2012, respectively. The Giants were originally from New York City. There they were called the New York Giants. They played their games in several stadiums called the Polo Grounds. They were a very good team in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Under John McGraw, the Giants won the 1905, 1921 and 1922 World Series. At that time, some of their players were Christy Mathewson and Bill Terry. Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe also briefly played for the team. By the 1950s, the Polo Grounds were old, and the Giants wanted a new stadium. Since they could not get one in New York, they moved to San Francisco. After the move to San Francisco, the Giants lost three World Series in 1962, 1989, and 2002. But they won three Series in 2010, 2012, and 2014. In 2016, they had another shot at winning the Series in an even year; but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the eventual champion Chicago Cubs. == References == == Other websites == * Official Website * San Francisco Giants at Sportiki * San Francisco Giants Forum * San Francisco Giants 2000-present * San Francisco Giants on Scout.com",
