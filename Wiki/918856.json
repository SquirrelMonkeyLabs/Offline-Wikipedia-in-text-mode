 "text": "Silambu (; /cil’əmpɨ̆/), or Gaggara (Tulu: ಗಗ್ಗರ), is an anklet worn and used in many different ways on the Indian subcontinent. == Etymology == According to Jeyaraj, the word 'silambu' is derived from the verb 'silambal', meaning 'to make sound'. == Description == The silambu is filled with beads or small balls that make noise when the wearer moves or dances. It may be worn on the ankle or the leg. When worn on the leg, it is called kālchilambu in Tamil. Some silambu are made of copper and use iron balls to make sound. Others are made of silver. ==In dance== In Tamil Nadu, a traditional dance called Kai Silambu Attam is danced at the temple during the Amman festival or Navratri festival. During this dance, the dancers wear silambu on their ankles and also hold them in their hands. They have different styles of jumping in their dance. This vibration produces sound in the silambu. Nautch and Kandyan dancers may wear silambu. == In literature == The main character of the epic Silappatikaram (a story of Silambu) is based on Kannagita's attempt to sell her anklet Silambu. The title comes from the name of the anklet. == In festivals == Silambu are sometimes placed on cows' legs during the Pongal festival. ==Gallery== File:Silambu Anklets.jpg|Anklets, Tamil Nadu == References == * * Category:Tamil culture",
