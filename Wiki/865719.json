 "text": "The hardhead (Aythya australis), also known as the white eyed duck, is the only true diving duck found in Australia. The common name \"hardhead\" has nothing to do with the hardness of the bird's skull, instead referring to the difficulty encountered by early taxidermists in studying the head. Hardheads are found in wetter, coastal regions of Australia, particularly in the south- east, but are known to live as far as New Guinea, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. ==References== Category:Ducks Category:Birds of Oceania",
