 "text": "The M72 Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW) is a small, lightweight rocket launcher used by the US military and other NATO countries. It weighs only five-and-a- half pounds. It is so small that it only needs one person, rather than two for the bazooka. It was used often during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese military and guerillas did not use tanks often since so much fighting was in the jungle, but the LAW has been used in wars around the world for destroying bunkers and trenches.
