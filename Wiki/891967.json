He was known for his strong progressive views. He is seen as the Supreme Court's most liberal justice ever, and supported expanding individual rights on a number of fields. So far, he served the longest time of any justice, and wrote the most opinions. Finally, Douglas was forced to retire in 1975 after a severe stroke. He was previously a politician for the Democratic party and several influential liberals wanted him for vice president alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt for the 1944 presidential elections. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Category:United States Supreme Court justices Category:Politicians from Minnesota Category:American progressives Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians",
