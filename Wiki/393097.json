 "text": "Decapitated are a Polish technical death metal band from Krosno. Decapitated was formed in 1996 by guitarist Wacław \"Vogg\" Kiełtyka, his brother drummer Witold \"Vitek\" Kiełtyka, and vocalist Wojciech \"Sauron\" Wąsowicz when they were all in their teens. Bassist Marcin \"Martin\" Rygiel joined the band a year later and they released their first demo, Cemeterial Gardens, in 1997 as well as their second demo, The Eye of Horus, in 1998. The band released their debut album, Winds of Creation on April 11, 2000. The album was well-received and their second studio album Nihility was released on February 19, 2002. Decapitated was chosen to perform at the Polish Ozzfest event in late May. They released their third studio album The Negation on March 9, 2004 and it was produced by both Slawek and Vojtek Wieslawski. Sauron quit the band in 2005 and was replaced by Adrian \"Covan\" Kowanek. The band recorded Organic Hallucinosis and released the album on February 7, 2006. It was their fourth studio album and first album with their new vocalist. Martin left the band sometime after to live with his family and to move to California. On October 28, 2007, the band was involved in an automobile accident when their tour bus collided with a truck carrying wood in Gomel. Vitek and Covan were injured in the accident and Vitek died on November 2, 2007 in a Russian hospital from the injuries he sustained. Covan went into a coma and the band went on hiatus. The band ended their hiatus after Vogg said that he was searching for a new drummer and vocalist. Vocalist Rafał Piotrowski, bassist Filip \"Heinrich\" Hałucha and drummer Kerim \"Krimh\" Lechner all joined the band in 2009. They recorded their fifth studio album Carnival Is Forever and released it on July 12, 2011. Heinrich left the band after to concentrate on his other band Vesania. Lechner left the band in September 2012 and was replaced by Paweł Jaroszewicz. == Band members == ;Current *Wacław \"Vogg\" Kiełtyka - Guitar (1996−2007, 2009−present) *Rafał \"Rasta\" Piotrowski - vocals (2009–present) *Paweł Pasek - Bass (2012-present) *Paweł \"Pawulon\" Jaroszewicz - Drums (2012-present) ;Former *Wojciech \"Sauron\" Wąsowicz – vocals (1996–2005) *Witold \"Vitek\" Kiełtyka – drums (1996–2007) (†) *Marcin \"Martin\" Rygiel – bass guitar (1997–2005, 2006–2007) *Adrian \"Covan\" Kowanek – vocals (2005–2007) *Filip \"Heinrich\" Hałucha – bass guitar (2009−2011) *Kerim \"Krimh\" Lechner – drums (2009−2012) ;Live *Jacek Hiro – guitars (2000−2004) *Richard Gulczynski – bass guitar (2005−2006) *Konrad Rossa – bass guitar (2011−2012) ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Winds of Creation (2000) *Nihility (2002) *The Negation (2004) *Organic Hallucinosis (2006) *Carnival Is Forever (2011) *Blood Mantra (2014) *Anticult (2017) ==References== == Other websites == *Official website Category:1990s music groups Category:1996 establishments in Europe Category:2000s music groups Category:2010s music groups Category:Death metal bands Category:Polish musical groups Category:1990s establishments in Poland",
