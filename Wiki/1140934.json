 "text": "A grandfather clause, also known as grandfather policy or grandfathering, is a legal provision that allows individuals or entities to continue operating under an old rule, even after a new rule or regulation has been implemented. Those who benefit from this clause are said to have \"grandfather rights\" or to have been \"grandfathered in.\" The exemption generally applies to situations that existed before the introduction of new laws or regulations, while future scenarios are subject to the updated rules. Grandfather clauses are often used in contexts such as regulatory changes, voting rights, or licensing laws, as a practical way to avoid disrupting established practices. == Origin == The term \"grandfather clause\" originated in the late 19th century in the Southern United States as part of efforts to disenfranchise African American voters. After the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery, Southern states sought to limit the political power of freedmen. Legislators passed new requirements for voter registration, including literacy tests, payment of poll taxes, and residency or property restrictions. To ensure poor and illiterate whites were not excluded, many states included clauses that exempted individuals from these requirements if their grandfathers had been eligible to vote before the American Civil War or before a certain date. These laws effectively allowed many white voters to bypass restrictions while disenfranchising African Americans, who were largely unable to meet the new criteria. The first grandfather clauses appeared in the state constitutions and laws of states like Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia between 1890 and 1908. These provisions were part of the Jim Crow laws designed to enforce racial segregation and suppress the political rights of African Americans. == Legal challenges and unconstitutionality == In 1915, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the grandfather clauses in voting laws were unconstitutional in the case of Guinn v. United States. The Court found that the clauses violated the Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which prohibits denying the right to vote based on race. Despite this ruling, states continued to find other methods of disenfranchising black voters, such as implementing literacy tests and poll taxes. == Modern usage == Though the original use of the term \"grandfather clause\" was related to voting rights, the concept has since been applied to a wide range of situations. For instance, when new regulations are passed, existing businesses or practices may be allowed to continue operating under old rules, avoiding compliance with newer, stricter standards. Examples include environmental regulations, licensing requirements, or building codes where older entities are \"grandfathered in\" under previous regulations but new entities must follow updated rules.https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial- history-of-the-grandfather-clause == Examples of grandfather clauses == A power plant might be exempt from new pollution controls as long as it operates within its original capacity, but if it expands or modifies operations, it may be required to comply with the new regulations. Homeowners living in a region before new building codes were enacted may not be required to retrofit their homes to meet new standards unless they undergo major renovations. == Related pages == * Jim Crow laws * Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution * Ex post facto law == References == == Other websites == * Grandfather Clause at Encyclopedia Britannica Category:Legal terms",
