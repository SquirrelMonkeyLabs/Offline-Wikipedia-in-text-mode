 "text": "William Rowan Hamilton (4 August 1805 â€“ 2 September 1865) was an Irish mathematician, physicist and astronomer. He made important contributions to the development of optics, dynamics, mathematics, geometry and algebra. His discovery of quaternions is the most famous work. His work was important in the development of quantum mechanics. Hamilton's talent was discovered very early by the astronomer John Brinkley. In 1823, when Hamilton was eighteen, John Brinkley said: \"I don't say he would be but now he is the leading mathematician of his age\". Hamilton was the first to introduce the term \"vector\", \"association law\". == Reference == Category:1805 births Category:1865 deaths Category:Theoretical physicists Category:British physicists Category:English mathematicians Category:Irish physicists",
