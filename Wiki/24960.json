 "text": "The Archaea (or Archea) are a group of single-celled organisms. The name comes from Greek αρχαία, \"old ones\". They are a major division of living organisms. Archaea are tiny, simple organisms. They were originally discovered in extreme environments (extremophiles), but are now thought to be common to more average conditions. Many can survive at very high (over 80 °f) or very low temperatures, or highly salty, acidic or alkaline water. Some have been found in geysers, black smokers, oil wells, and hot vents in the deep ocean. Recent research has found ammonia-eating archaea in soil and seawater. In the past they had been classed with bacteria as prokaryotes (or Kingdom Monera) and named archaebacteria, but this is a mistake. The Archaea have an independent evolutionary history and show many differences in their biochemistry from other forms of life. They are now classified as a separate domain in the three-domain system. In this system, the three distinct branches of evolutionary descent are the Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota. Archaea are, like bacteria, prokaryotes: single-celled organisms that do not have nuclei and cell organelles of the eukaryote type. ==Comparison to other domains== The following table compares some major characteristics of the three domains, to illustrate their similarities and differences.Information is from Willey JM, Sherwood LM, Woolverton CJ. Microbiology 7th ed. (2008), Ch. 19 pp. 474–475, except where noted. Many of these characteristics are also discussed below. Property Archaea Bacteria Eukarya Cell membrane Ether-linked lipids, pseudopeptidoglycan Ester-linked lipids, peptidoglycan Ester-linked lipids, various structures Gene structure Circular chromosomes, similar translation and transcription to Eukarya Circular chromosomes, unique translation and transcription Multiple, linear chromosomes, similar translation and transcription to Archaea Internal cell structure No membrane-bound organelles (but questioned:) or nucleus No membrane-bound organelles or nucleus Membrane- bound organelles and nucleus Metabolism Various, with methanogenesis unique to Archaea Various, including photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic respiration, fermentation, and autotrophy Photosynthesis, cellular respiration and fermentation Reproduction Asexual reproduction, horizontal gene transfer Asexual reproduction, horizontal gene transfer Sexual and asexual reproduction = Interesting facts about archaea: *No archaean species can do photosynthesis.Schäfer G. et al 1999. Bioenergetics of the Archaea. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 63 (3): 570–620. PMID 10477309. *Archaea only reproduce asexually. *Archaea show high levels of horizontal gene transfer between lineages. *Many archaea live in extreme environments. *Unlike bacteria, no archaea produce spores. *Archaea are common in the ocean, and especially in the plankton. They make up to 20% of all microbial cells in the ocean.
