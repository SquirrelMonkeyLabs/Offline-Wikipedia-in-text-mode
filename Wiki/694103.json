He is the eighth great-grandchild of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is the 4th grandchild of King Charles III and is sixth in line of succession to the British throne. == Birth and family == He was born at 05:26 BST (04:26 UTC) on 6 May 2019. at Portland Hospital in London. His name was announced on 8 May 2019. He was baptised wearing the royal christening gown by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 6 July 2019 in the private chapel at Windsor Castle. The ceremony was private and the public were not invited to see the family or guests arrive or leave. Archie descends from the British royal family on his father's side and from the American working and middle classes on his mother's side. He is a citizen both of the United Kingdom and of the United States. He is the first half-American and the third multiracial child in the history of the British monarchy. == Succession == As a grandson of King Charles III, Archie is sixth in the line of succession to the British throne. At the time of his birth, he normally would be entitled to use his Prince Harry's senior subsidiary title, Earl of Dumbarton, as a courtesy. However, it was reported that the Duke and Duchess decided that he would be styled as Master Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, as they wanted him to grow up as a private citizen. In the 2021 television interview, the Duchess of Sussex said that she had been told that changes would be made to remove Archie's entitlement to the style of \"prince\" as part of Charles's reported plans for a slimmed-down monarchy. == Titles == 8 May 2019-9 March 2023: Master Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor 9 March 2023: His Royal Highness Prince Archie Harrison of Sussex ==References== ==Other websites== *Prince Archie of Sussex at the Royal Family website Category:2019 births Category:Living people Category:House of Windsor Category:British princes Category:People from London Category:Royal children",
