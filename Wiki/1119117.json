 "text": "The Red Pencil protest happened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on January 4, 2014. It was organized by the Angry Media Movement (GERAMM) and supported by media workers, activists, and others. The protest was a response to the Malaysian government's limits on media freedom and the suspension of a weekly newspaper, The Heat. Many in the media believe the government suspended The Heat because it reported on Prime Minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor's spending. ==References== Category:2010s in Malaysia Category:Politics of Malaysia",
