 "text": "The Book of Rites, also called the Liji, is a group of writings that explain the customs, rules, and ceremonies of the Zhou dynasty during the Warring States and early Han periods. The Book of Rites, the Rites of Zhou, and the Ettiquette and Ceremonial are called the \"Three Li,\" and together make up the ritual section of the Five Classics. These are important texts in Confucianism, which is a way of thinking that values ethics and education. Some people believe that the Book of Rites was originally called the Classic of Rites or Lijing, but its name was changed later by Dai Sheng. ==References== Category:Confucianism Category:Chinese literature",
