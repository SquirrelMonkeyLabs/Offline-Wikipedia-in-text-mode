 "text": "The common big-eyed tree frog (Nyctimystes narinosus) is a group of species of tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it on Mount Hagen in the Wahgi Valley region more than 2400 meters (8000 feet) above sea level. The female frog is 6.4 cm long. It has side-to-side marks on its lower eyelid. The skin of the dead, preserved frog is darker brown on the back and lighter brown on the belly. It has much less webbing on its toes than other frogs in Nyctimystes. In the local Kaironk language, this frog is called mabas, but other frogs are called by this name too. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
