 "text": "The 2022 Victorian state election was held on 26 November 2022 to elect the 60th Parliament of Victoria, including 87 of the 88 seats in the Legislative Assembly and all 40 seats in the Legislative Council. The seat of Narracan was not up for election, with the election there being postponed due to the death of a candidate, causing a by-election. The election was conducted by the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC). The incumbent Labor government, led by Premier Daniel Andrews, won a third term in government, opposed by the Liberal/National Coalition, led by Matthew Guy. The election was referred to by many as a referendum on the Andrews government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which notably involved several unpopular lockdowns. However, the Andrews government was re-elected with the Labor Party's second highest number of seats in Victorian history, despite a two-party swing against them of 2.50%. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Elections in Victoria Category:2022 elections in Australia",
