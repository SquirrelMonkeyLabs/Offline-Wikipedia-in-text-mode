May you live among the homelands As an address for grandeur Filling every heart conveyed by every tongue. With the spirit, With the body, Your son has come To answer your call. In my mouth and in my blood, Your love stirred up as light and fire. Let's go brothers! Heading for grandeur, Making the world witness That we here perpetually live With the motto: God, Homeland, King.
