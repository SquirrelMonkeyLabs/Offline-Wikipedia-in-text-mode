 "text": "This article gives information about the relative size of denominations, based mainly on claims by the churches themselves. ==Christian denominational families== ==Christianity – 2.51 billion== ===Catholicism – 1.329 billion=== Catholicism is the largest branch of Christianity with 1.329 billion and the Catholic Church is the largest among churches. Figures below are in accordance with the Annuario Pontificio, at 2018. The total figure does not include independent Catholic denominations (18 million). ;Latin Church – 1.311 billion ;Eastern Catholic Churches – 18 million * Byzantine Rite – 8.2 million **Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church – 5.5 million ** Melkite Greek Catholic Church – 1.6 million ** Romanian Greek Catholic Church – 0.5 million ** Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church – 0.4 million ** Hungarian Greek Catholic Church – 0.3 million ** Slovak Greek Catholic Church – 0.3 million ** Belarusian Greek Catholic Church – 0.1 million ** Italo-Albanian Catholic Church – 0.01 million ** Greek Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia – 0.01 million ** Georgian Byzantine Catholic Church – 0.01 million; ** Albanian Greek Catholic Church – 0.01 million ** Russian Greek Catholic Church – 0.01 million ** Macedonian Greek Catholic Church – 0.001 million ** Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church – 0.001 million ** Greek Byzantine Catholic Church – 0.001 million * East Syriac Rite – 4.9 million ** Syro-Malabar Catholic Church – 4.3 million ** Chaldean Catholic Church – 0.6 million * West Syriac Rite – 4.2 million ** Maronite Church – 3.5 million ** Syro-Malankara Catholic Church – 0.5 million ** Syriac Catholic Church – 0.2 million * Armenian Rite – 0.8 million ** Armenian Catholic Church – 0.8 million * Alexandrian Rite – 0.5 million **Coptic Catholic Church – 0.2 million ** Eritrean Catholic Church – 0.2 million ** Ethiopian Catholic Church – 0.1 million ;Canonically irregular groups * Society of Saint Pius X – 1 million (claimed) ====Independent Catholicism – 18 million==== Various denominations self-identifying as Catholic, despite not being affiliated with the Catholic Church. * Philippine Independent Church – 6 million (Part of the Anglican Communion) * Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association – 6 million * Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church – 5 million * Traditionalist Mexican-American Catholic Church – 2 million * Old Catholic Church – 0.1 million (Part of the Anglican Communion) * Polish National Catholic Church – 0.03 million * Apostolic Catholic Church – 0.005 million * Palmarian Catholic Church – 0.002 million ===Protestantism – 900 million=== Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians by number of followers. Estimates vary from 600 million to a billion, or nearly 24%-40% of all Christians.Global Christianity – A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population , The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, December 2011Jay Diamond, Larry. Plattner, Marc F. and Costopoulos, Philip J. World Religions and Democracy. 2005, page 119.( also in PDF file (archived from the original on 13 April 2008), p49), saying \"Not only do Protestants presently constitute 13 percent of the world's population—about 800 million people—but since 1900 Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\" The main reason for this wide range is the lack of a common agreement among scholars as to which denominations constitute Protestantism. For instance, most sources but not all include Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists and Independent Nondenominational Christianity as part of Protestantism. Moreover, Protestant denominations altogether do not form a single structure comparable to the Catholic Church, or to a lesser extent the Eastern Orthodox Communion. However, several different comparable communions exist within Protestantism, such as the Anglican Communion, World Communion of Reformed Churches, World Baptist Alliance, World Methodist Council and the World Lutheran Federation. Regardless, 900 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article. Note that this 900 million figure also includes Anglicanism, as well as Anabaptists, Baptists and multiple other groups that might sometimes disavow a common \"Protestant\" designation, and would rather prefer to be called, simply, \"Christian\". ====Historical Protestantism – 300–400 million==== The number of individuals who are members of historical Protestant Churches totals to 300-400 million. =====Anglicanism – 110 million===== There are about 110 million Christians in Anglican tradition, mostly part of the Anglican Communion, the third largest Christian denomination in the world.

Reformation of the 16th century or its commonly acknowledged offshoots. Instead, they are broadly linked to Pentecostalism or similar other independent evangelical and revivalistic movements that originated in the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, several sources tend to differentiate them from Protestants and classify them as together as Independents, Non-core Protestants etc. Also included in this category are the numerous, yet very similar Nondenominational churches. Nonetheless, sources eventually combine their numbers to the Protestant tally. Despite the absence of centralized control or leadership, if considered as a single cohort, this will easily be the second largest Christian tradition after Roman Catholicism. According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC), there are an estimated 450 million Independents world-wide, as of mid-2019. =====Pentecostalism – 280 million===== Those who are members of the Pentecostal denomination number around 280 million people. *Assemblies of God – 68.5 millionInfluence Magazine | Five AG Stats You Need to Know * Apostolic Church – 15 million * International Circle of Faith – 11 millionAssociation of Christian Churches.

Its main body consists of the various autocephalous churches along with the autonomous and other churches canonically linked to them, for the most part form a single communion, making the Eastern Orthodox Church the second largest single denomination behind the Catholic Church. In addition, there are several Eastern Orthodox splinter groups and non-universally recognized churches. ;Autocephalous churches – 166 million * Russian Orthodox Church – 100 million *Romanian Orthodox Church – 17–18.8 millionEastern Orthodox Churches at World Council of Churches2011 Romanian census. * Greek Orthodox Church– 10 million * Serbian Orthodox Church – 8-12 million * Bulgarian Orthodox Church – 8-10 million * Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople – 5.25 million * Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch – 4.3 million * Georgian Orthodox Church – 3.5 million * Church of Cyprus – 0.7 million * Polish Orthodox Church – 0.6 million * Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria – 0.5 million * Albanian Orthodox Church – 0.4 million * Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem – 0.4 million * Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church – 0.075 million ;Autonomous churches – 13 million * Orthodox Church of Ukraine (Constantinopole Patriarchate) – 25.2 million * Metropolitan Church of Chișinău and All Moldova (Moscow Patriarchate) – 3.2 million * Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia – 0.4 million * Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia (Moldova) (Romanian Patriarchate) – 0.72 million \"Biserica Ortodoxă Română, atacată de bisericile 'surori'\" (\"The Romanian Orthodox Church, Attacked by Its 'Sister' Churches\") , Ziua, 31 January 2008 * Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric (North Macedonia) – 0.34 million * Estonian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) – 0.3 million * Finnish Orthodox Church (Ecumenical Patriarchate) – 0.06 million * Chinese Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) – 0.03 million * Japanese Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) – 0.03 million * Latvian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) – 0.02 million * Estonian Orthodox Church (Ecumenical Patriarchate) – 0.02 million ;Churches in communion with the above Orthodox Churches but with disputed autocephaly – 1 million * Orthodox Church in America – 1 million ;Non-universally recognized churches – 18-24.27 million * Orthodox Church of Ukraine – 12–18 million *Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church – 2.4 million *Macedonian Orthodox Church – 2 million *Orthodox Church of Greece (Holy Synod in Resistance) – 0.75 million *Old Calendarist Romanian Orthodox Church – 0.50 million *Old Calendar Bulgarian Orthodox Church – 0.45 million *Orthodox Church in Italy – 0.12 million *Montenegrin Orthodox Church – 0.05 million ;Other separated Orthodox groups – 6 million * Old Believers – 5.5 million * Greek Old Calendarists – 0.86 million * True Orthodox Church – 0.85 million * Evangelical Orthodox Church – 0.07 million ===Oriental Orthodoxy – 62 million=== The Oriental Orthodox Churches are those descended from those that rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451.
