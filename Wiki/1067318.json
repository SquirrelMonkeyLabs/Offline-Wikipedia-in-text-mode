 "text": "DC Black Label is a DC Comics imprint established in 2018 that specialises in providing unique, edgy, and provocative standalone stories based on DC Universe characters, in the tradition of defining works such as All-Star Superman, Watchmen, and DC: The New Frontier. It was intended to allow writers and artists the opportunity to tell their definitive DC stories without being constrained by continuity or age ratings. The imprint publishes prestige original limited series, both canon or otherwise, as well as reprints of critically acclaimed graphic novels. Since 2019, Hill House Comics, the stand- alone horror imprint, is also published under DC Black Label. == Original titles == * Batman: Damned * Batman: Last Knight on Earth * Superman: Year One * Batman: Curse of the White Knight * Harleen * Joker/Harley: Criminal Sanity * The Last God * Joker: Killer Smile * Batman: White Knight Presents Von Freeze #1 * The Question: The Deaths of Vic Sage * Dark Knight Returns: The Golden Child #1 * Wonder Woman: Dead Earth * Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey * Strange Adventures (Volume 5) * Birds of Prey (Volume 4) #1 * Batman: The Smile Killer #1 * Batman: Three Jokers * Hellblazer: Rise and Fall * Rorschach * American Vampire 1976 * Batman: White Knight Presents Harley Quinn * Sweet Tooth: The Return * The Other History of the DC Universe * Batman/Catwoman * The Nice House on the Lake * Batman: Reptilian * Suicide Squad: Get Joker! * Refrigerator Full of Heads * Superman vs. Lobo * Batman vs. Bigby!
