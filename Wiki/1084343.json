 "text": "Quds News Network is a Palestinian news agency founded in 2011. The news agency's workers are mainly employed with volunteer reporters across Palestine. The news network got many followers near 2015 due to its fast video coverage of the Israelâ€“Palestine conflict, which made it close to being as popular as Al Jazeera, but the network mainly appealed to younger audiences. Their website was blocked by the ruling Fatah party in the Palestinian Authority in 2019 due to crackdowns. Some of their social media platforms were also blocked in the years 2019 and 2023. == References == Category:Palestine Category:journalism Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Hamas allies",
