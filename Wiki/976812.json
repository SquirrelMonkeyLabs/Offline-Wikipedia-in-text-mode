 "text": "\"La Tchadienne\" (\"The Chadian\") is the national anthem of Chad. ==Lyrics== French lyrics Arabic lyrics Arabic transliteration English translation People of Chad, arise and to work! You have conquered your soil and won your rights; Your freedom will be born of your courage. Lift up your eyes, the future is yours. I O my Country, may God protect you, May your neighbours admire your children. Joyful, peaceful, advance as you sing, Faithful to your fathers who are watching you. II Race of the North, and its immense herds, Race of the South, who cultivates the fields. Shepherds, mountaineers, fishers and traders, Let us be a single great people who advances. III Hoe in hand, valiantly make your rope, See your children who are tomented by hunger, The fields before you wait for your grain. Let oil flow and your granaries overflow. IV Your engineers will trace roads on you Your physicians will make you big and strong To the student's work, without worrying about the effort Put ignorance and evil in debacle. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Chad",
