 "text": "Ejective consonants are sounds made without using your voice, where air is pushed out using a part of your throat called the glottis. In some languages, these sounds are different from others like those made with a puff of air (aspirated), those made with your vocal cords (voiced), and those made with just enough air (tenuis). Some languages also have sounds that are like ejectives but with a creaky voice, while others have sounds like ejectives but are made differently, like implosives. This has led experts to group these kinds of sounds together as a special type of consonant called glottalic consonants, which includes ejectives. Category:Consonants",
