Both versions credit Eminem under the name Slim Shady. The album's title and cover art allude to the 1958 Jeff Alexander album, Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By. Via social media Eminem posted an image of the Jeff Alexander album cover, which features Alfred Hitchcock too holding an ax and a gun to his own head, stating the album was \"inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!\". ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Eminem albums Category:Aftermath Entertainment albums Category:Interscope Records albums Category:Shady Records albums",
