 "text": "Operation Sea Lion () was the plan to invade the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. However, Germany first had to control the sky and sea of the English Channel before a land invasion. With the German Navy weakened during the German invasion of Norway and the Luftwaffe defeated at the Battle of Britain,the invasion was put off on 17 September 1940 and so never happened.David Shears, \"Hitlerâ€™s D-Day\", MHQ, vol. 6 Number 4 (Summer 1994) Some historians think Germany could have invaded Great Britain with exploitation of friendly countries and unity within the German military. Most historians however believe that the German plans would have had little chance of success. == References == Category:World War II",
