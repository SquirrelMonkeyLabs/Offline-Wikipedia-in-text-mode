And in God's will, burn to ashes the hopes of the years to come that we should have lived and loved. But oh Sarah, when the dead come back to this earth so they can fly unseen around the people they loved, I'll always be there. Wait for me as if I'm gone, 'cause I'll see you again. -Major Sullivan Ballou ==References== Category:American lawyers Category:1829 births Category:1861 deaths",
