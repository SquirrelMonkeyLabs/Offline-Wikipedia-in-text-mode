It is most known for being placed at the end of the Sermon on the Mount speech from Jesus in chapter 7 of the Gospel of Matthew, and the Sermon on the Plain in chapter 6 of the Gospel of Luke. The parable is about how a person can listen to Jesus' teachings and listen to it and accept it. == Text == In the Gospel of Matthew, the parable is found at the end of the Sermon on the Mount: “Whoever hears these teachings of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on rock. It rained hard, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house. But it did not fall because it was built on rock. “Whoever hears these teachings of mine and does not obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. It rained hard, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house. And it fell with a loud crash.” —Matthew 7:24-27 (ERV) == References == Category:Parables of Jesus",
