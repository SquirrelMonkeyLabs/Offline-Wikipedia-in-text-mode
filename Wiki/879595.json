 "text": "\"Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah\" is the lexigraphic representation of a common children's chant. There are many other vocalizations for the tune. \"Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah\" is seen particularly in the eastern United States and modern Britain. Other manifestations include: * \"Neener neener neener\" in the United States * \"Nanny nanny boo boo\" in the southern United States * \"Na-na- na banana\" in Israel * \"Na na na na nère\" in France * \"Du kan inte ta mig\" in Sweden (meaning \"You can't catch me\") The initial taunt is sometimes followed by further verses using the same tune, for instance in America \"Nanny nanny nanny goat, cannot catch a billy goat\" or following \"Nanny nanny boo boo\" with \"Stick your head in doo-doo\". In Croatia, children sing \"Ulovi me, ulovi me, kupit ću ti novine. Novine su skupe, poljubi me u dupe\" (which means: \"Catch me, catch me, [if you do that] I'll buy you a newspaper. Newspapers are pricey, kiss my tushie\". Context-meaningful words may be applied ad hoc, such as \"Johnny is a sis-sy\" or \"I can see your underwear!\" Non-taunting uses are also seen, also associated with children. One tune for Ring a Ring o' Roses (which is sung to many variant tunes) uses the \"Nyah nyah...\" musical figure; a common tune for Bye, baby Bunting uses a similar figure. ==References== Category:Children's songs",
