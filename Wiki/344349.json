 "text": "Super glue, or cyanoacrylate, is the common name for a group of fast-acting adhesives with industrial, medical and household uses. It normally comes in a small tube, and is often sold as \"Super Glue\" or \"Krazy Glue\". It is slightly toxic. Cyanoacrylate is an extremely strong glue. However, the glue is not so good at keeping together against shear (sideways pushing). There are other versions for medical and veterinary use, created to be non-toxic and less irritating to skin. Cyanoacrylate adhesives are sometimes known as instant glues. ==Safety== Super glue will stick to human skin instantly. If this happens, it can be removed with acetone, commonly found in nail polish remover. Medical grade super glue is sometimes used to seal small cuts, scrapes, and mild wounds. Never use in deep or puncture wounds. Super glue will burn if it comes in contact with cotton, including cotton clothing, cotton gloves, and cotton swabs. The severity of this reaction can range from a small amount of heat and smoke to starting a fire, depending on the amount of glue and/or cotton involved.
