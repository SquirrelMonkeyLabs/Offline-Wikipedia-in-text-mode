The program starts on December 1, but the actual Santa- tracking simulation starts on midnight of December 23. It is a community outreach function of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and has been held annually since 1955. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1955 establishments in the United States Category:Christmas",
