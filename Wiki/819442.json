 "text": "\"Maibi Jagoi\" () (literally, \"Priestess' dance\") is a traditional dance form performed by the maibis (priestesses) during the religious festival of Lai Haraoba. The dance form is enacted in various ways depending on the variation of the regions. The Maibi Jagoi dance form performed by the female priestesses of the Leihou tribe is one of the most remarkable one. Due to its unique way of performance and costume, the dance form is famous all over the Indian subcontinent and abroad. The maibis (priestesses) also enact \"Laihou Jagoi\" (\"Dance of invitation\"), along with the performance of \"pena\", a traditional music instrument. ==Related pages== * Panthoibi Jagoi ==References== ==Other websites== * http://www.e-pao.net/epGallery.asp?id=1&src;=Arts_Dances/Manipuri_Dance_Gallery/Maibi201912 * http://www.e-pao.net/epGallery.asp?id=1&src;=Arts_Dances/LaiHaraoba/MaibiJagoiSangai201112 * http://www.e-pao.net/epGallery.asp?id=1&src;=Arts_Dances/LaiHaraoba/ICCRMaibi20160422 Category:Art Category:Jagoi",
