 "text": "Herpetology is the branch of zoology concerned with reptiles and amphibians. It is about cold-blooded animals like salamanders, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, tuataras and crocodilians. ==Herp== \"Herp\" is a vernacular term for reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the old term \"herpetile\". Linnaeus grouped reptiles and amphibians together in the same class, and that is where the term comes from. The term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles. ==Batrachology== Batrachology is the study of amphibians. Batrachology can also mean that a person enjoys amphibians and are among their favorite pets. Category:Branches of zoology Category:Reptiles Category:Amphibians",
