 "text": "The Care Bears are a very successful toy franchise from the 1980s. Over forty million of these stuffed teddy bears, made with a variety of colours, were sold from 1983 to 1987. Each Bear had a name, a job, and a symbol tied to it. For example, Funshine Bear makes sure people have a good time, no matter what they are doing and has a sun on his stomach. The toys were first made as characters on cards in 1981; the original artwork was done by Elena Kucharik. Later, other toys called the Care Bear Cousins were introduced. They also gave way to three animated movies for the cinema in the mid-1980s. A related TV series from DIC and, later, Canada's Nelvana Limited came out at almost that same time. Recently, Care Bear toys have been brought back in a new edition for the twenty-first century. As part of this comeback, the Bears have appeared in their first two DVD movies (both computer-animated), as well as a few video games. ==Characters== There are lots of characters of the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins. Both of these groups live in the Kingdom of Caring, which is made up of Care-a-Lot (the home of the Care Bears proper) and the Forest of Feelings (the home of the Care Bear Cousins). ==The movies== #The Care Bears Movie (1985) #Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation (1986) #The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland (1987) #Care Bears The Nutcracker (1988) #Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot (2004) (direct to video) #The Care Bears' Big Wish Movie (2005) (direct to video) #Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!
