 "text": "Northwich is a town and civil parish in the county of Cheshire, England. The town is about east of Chester and south of Warrington. Northwich has been named as one of the best places to live in the UK according to the Sunday Times in 2014. The town also made the list in 2013. The area around Northwich has been famous for its salt since Roman times. Then the town was known as Condate. Mines dug under Northwich began collapsing in the late 19th century. Buildings began to disappear as they sank into the mines below. Several of the deep mines have since been filled in under a Â£28 million project finished in 2007. == References == Category:Towns in Cheshire Category:Civil parishes in Cheshire",
