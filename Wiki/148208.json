 "text": "The British Class 390 \"Pendolino\" electric multiple unit is a tilting train built by Fiat Ferroviaria using Fiat tilt systems. Now running for Avanti West Coast, fifty-three 9-car units were built for Virgin Trains from 2001 to 2004. These trains were the last to be assembled at Alstom's Washwood Heath plant, in Birmingham, before it closed in 2005. == Incidents == On the 23rd February 2007, a Class 390 derailed near Grayrigg in Cumbria. It was caused by a broken point in the train tracks. Sadly, one person died and 58 were hurt. In 2012, Network Rail was fined over Â£4 million for not keeping their tracks up to standard. == References == 390 Category:Tilting trains",
