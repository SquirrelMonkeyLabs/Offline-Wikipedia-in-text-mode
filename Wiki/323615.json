 "text": "LaGuardia Airport () is an airport in the northern part of the New York City borough of Queens. The airport is on the edge of Flushing Bay and Bowery Bay. It borders the neighborhoods of Astoria, Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst. La Guardia is popular because of its location near to Manhattan. Although the airport is small in size, wide-body airliners once flew there often. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 were designed for use at LaGuardia.http://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/blogs/orion/archive/2010/11/19/how- the-last-star-was-born.aspx The Boeing 767-400ER is the largest airliner that once flew to LGA; from 2000 to 2005, Delta used the 764 with 285 seats. Today, there are usually no widebody flights. Delta Air Lines does use a Boeing 767-300 at times for one of its Atlanta flights, and Air Canada sometimes sends their 767-300s there. On July 11, 2012, the airport became a domestic hub for Delta Air Lines. It is also a focus city for American Airlines and American Eagle. LaGuardia is the smallest of the New York metropolitan area's three main airports. The other two are John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in southern Queens and Newark Liberty International in Newark, New Jersey. LaGuardia is the closest of the three to Manhattan. These three airports are the largest airport system in the United States. They are the second most busy system of airports in the world by number of passengers. They are the first in the world in terms of total flight operations. In 2010, the airport had just under 24.0 million passenger. JFK had 46.5 million and Newark had 33.1 million. A total of about 104 million travelers used New York airports. Most flights from LaGuardia go to locations inside the United States and Canada. Some flights also go to Aruba, the Bahamas, and Bermuda, which have United States Department of Homeland Security preclearance services. The airport has ICE/CPB facilities to deal with customs and immigration for international flights but they cannot deal with a large number of passengers at one time. LaGuardia is the busiest airport in the United States without any non-stop flights to and from Europe. Nonstop flights to or from LaGuardia are limited to only . This does not include flights on Saturdays and flights to Denver. Because of this most flights across the continent and international flights use JFK or Newark. The airport was first named Glenn H. Curtiss Airport. It was named for Glenn Hammond Curtiss.Kenneth T. Jackson: The Encyclopedia of New York City: The New-York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. P. 470. It was later renamed North Beach Airport. New York City took control of the airport and named it New York Municipal Airport- LaGuardia Field. In 1953, it was named \"LaGuardia Airport\" for Fiorello La Guardia, the mayor of New York when the airport was built. The airport is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. == Airlines == * Air Canada * Air Canada Express: ::Jazz Air * American Airlines * American Eagle * Delta Air Lines * Delta Connection: ::Chautauqua Airlines ::Compass Airlines ::Pinnacle Airlines ::Shuttle America * Delta Shuttle :: Delta Air Lines ::Shuttle America * Frontier Airlines ::Republic Airlines * JetBlue Airways * Southwest Airlines * Spirit Airlines * United Airlines * United Express: ::Chautauqua Airlines ::ExpressJet ::Mesa Airlines ::Shuttle America ::SkyWest Airlines ===Top airlines and destinations=== Busiest Domestic Routes from LGA (October 2010 - September 2011) Rank City Passengers Top carriers 1 Chicago, Illinois (ORD) 1,287,000 American, Delta, Spirit, United 2 Atlanta, Georgia 1,134,000 AirTran, American, Delta 3 Fort Lauderdale, Florida 727,000 Delta, JetBlue, Spirit 4 Charlotte, North Carolina 559,000 American, US Airways 5 Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (DFW) 547,000 American 6 Miami, Florida 542,000 American, Delta, Frontier, Spirit 7 Detroit, Michigan 462,000 American, Delta, Spirit 8 Boston, Massachusetts 459,000 Delta, US Airways 9 Washington, DC (DCA) 379,000 Delta, US Airways 10 Orlando, Florida 350,000 AirTran, Delta, JetBlue ==References== ==Other websites== *LaGuardia Airport (official site) *LGA Airport Monitor (from Passur.com) *Transportation Methods for Getting to LaGuardia Airport *Using the subway/bus to cheaply get to LaGuardia Airport *LaGuardia by private jet * * *LaGuardia airport information (from airport- viewer.com) * *Heli Flights Heliports and Helipads near Manhattan (New York City Helicopter landing pads) Category:Airports in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in New York City Category:Queens (New York City)",
