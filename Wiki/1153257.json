 "text": "Prince Salim led an Invasion of Mewar after the death of Rana Pratap, his son Amar Singh I successfully repulsed the Mughal Invasion of Mewar from 1600-1603 A.D. ==Battle== After Maharana Pratap's death, Akbar saw another opportunity to conquer Mewar. He sent a strong force led by Raja Mansingh, Shah Kuli Khan, and other senior commanders, with Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir) nominally in charge. Abu-l-Fazl notes that Prince Salim, used to luxury and indulgence, spent most of his time in Ajmer. His commanders, however, took control of key outposts in central Mewar. Maharana Pratapâ€™s successor, the Amar Singh I, followed his father's strategy by retreating to the hilly regions of western Mewar. The Mewar forces mounted strong resistance and launched surprise attacks on the Mughal outposts. In one such attack, Sultan Khan Ghori, stationed at Bagor, was killed by Mewar troops. Prince Salim eventually arrived in Udaipur and ordered his commanders to pursue the Mewar forces more actively. In response, the Maharana raided Mughal territories near Malpura, looting several towns. The Mughal prince quickly sent Madhosingh Kachhawa with troops to drive the Mewar forces out. However, the Maharana launched a surprise night attack, defeating the Mughal commanders like Raza Kuli, Lal Beg, Mubariz Beg, and Aliph Khan. The Mughal outpost at Unthala, led by Shamsh Khan Kayam Khani, was captured through a clever strategy, which dealt a serious blow to the Mughal efforts. When disturbances broke out in Bengal, Mansingh Kachhawa had to return, and much of the Mughal army left Mewar. With their retreat, the Maharana recaptured all the Mughal-held outposts. As a result, the Mughal campaign failed, though some officers were left behind at Mandal, where they were killed in 1603. == References == Category:Mewar",
