 "text": "The bluebelly poison frog, blue-bellied poison arrow frog, or blue-bellied poison frog (Andinobates minutus) is a frog. It lives in Panama and Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests that are not too high above sea level. It lives in forests that have been cut down if they have had a long time to grow back. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles on his back. He takes them to water. For example, he takes them to water in the leaves of bromeliad plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. It is in some danger because human beings cut down forests to make farms and towns and get wood to build with. Chemicals from farms that are against the law can also kill this frog. People do not catch this frog to sell as a pet, even though people do catch other frogs in Acidinobates. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
