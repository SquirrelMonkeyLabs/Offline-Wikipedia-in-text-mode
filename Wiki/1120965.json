 "text": "The genus Polyscytalum is a group of fungi that is important for its role as a pathogen of potatoes. == Habitat == The usual habitat of Polyscytalum fungi is the colder and damper regions of Europe and Asia. == Disease == The fungus Polyscytalum pustulans (formerly known as Oosporia pustulans) can cause potato skin spot disease. The infection most often enters the potato plant through the lenticel at the base of the base of the stem. Once inside, the fungus will spread across the roots of the plant and infect any new potatoes the plant grows. The infection results in raised circular patches of rot on the potato tubers. These only appear after around 6â€“12 weeks of storage. The disease is usually spread by planting infected potatoes in the ground. The fungus can also live in the soil for up to 5 years and then infect healthy potatoes directly from there. == References == Category:Fungi Category:Diseases and disorders of plants",
