 "text": "DeMuDi (Debian Multimedia Distribution) was a Linux distribution based on Debian with improvements for music, sound and video production. DeMuDi was developed by the AGNULA Project, a European Union funded project to improve access to multimedia software, and was also known as A/DeMuDi, with A standing for Agnula. When funding stopped volunteers continued to work on the project for a short time, but now it is part of the Debian Multimedia Project. ==Related pages== * Debian * Ubuntu Studio == Other websites == * DeMuDi website * Debian Multimedia Project Category:Free software Category:Linux distributions Category:Debian-based Linux distributions",
