 "text": "A metalloid is a type of chemical element. Metalloids are elements that have the properties of both metal and non-metal elements. It might be shiny, but brittle. It might be dull, but conduct electricity. Metalloids are also sometimes called semimetals, especially in older sources. The term \"metalloid\" is preferred because \"semimetal\" has a different meaning in physics. The most common metalloid is silicon. Silicon has electrical conductivity between metals and nonmetals. It is a semiconductor. == Elements == There is no single definition of a \"metalloid\", and different sources include different elements in the category. The periodic table here shows the dividing line between metals and nonmetals, with colored cells showing elements that are sometimes called metalloids. The six green elements - boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium - are the most common group of metalloids, and are almost always called such. Polonium and astatine are both very radioactive synthetic elements, so it is hard to study their chemistry or physical properties. Selenium has a mixture of properties of metals and nonmetals, and is sometimes counted as a metalloid. Carbon and aluminium are usually considered a nonmetal and a metal, but are metalloids according to some specific definitions. Specific definitions of a metalloid can also include elements not in this chart. == Gallery == File:Antimony-119743.jpg|Antimony, a semimetal, can be found naturally in the earth.
