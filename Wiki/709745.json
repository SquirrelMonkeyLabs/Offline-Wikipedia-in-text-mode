 "text": "A vertical bar is the glyph \"|\". It has several other names besides vertical bar, such as \"pipe\", \"vertical slash\", and \"bar\". In mathematics, it may be put on both sides of a real or complex number to mean its absolute value. When applied on both sides of a matrix, it means its determinant. When placed in between two numbers, it means the divisibility relation (for example. a \\mid b means \"a divides b\"). In mathematics, double vertical bars are also used to refer to various mathematical concepts. These include the parallel relation (as in \\ell_1 \\parallel \\ell_2) and the norm of a vector (as in \\| \\mathbf{v}\\|). == Related pages == * Macron == References == Category:Typography",
