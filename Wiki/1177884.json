 "text": "\"Every Time I Hear Your Name\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Keith Anderson. It was released in January 2006 as the third single from his debut album Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Kristin Barlowe and premiered on April 6, 2006. It features Anderson performing the song with an old-fashioned microphone in a junkyard (he is seen in some scenes wearing a blue bandana instead of cowboy hat), on the interior of a fence, and in a warehouse. He is also seen making out with his lover in a convertible in the rain with the top down. It is informed that she is also a recording artist, and after her time in the studio, he picks her up in the convertible and they ride off together (after she passes another young couple who kiss). It debuted at number 20 on CMT's Top 20 Countdown for the week of June 8, 2006. ==References== Category:2005 songs Category:2000s ballads Category:Country ballads Category:Country songs Category:Keith Anderson songs",
