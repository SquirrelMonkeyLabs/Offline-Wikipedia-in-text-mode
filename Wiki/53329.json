 "text": "The Winter War was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from its organization. Despite the presentation above, when asked from Google: \"How many Finns died in winter war?\" Google answers: \"323,000 total casualties\" The Winter War (30 November 1939 â€“ 13 March 1940) was a conflict fought between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began when the Soviet Union invaded Finland soon after the invasion of Poland. The Soviet military forces expected a victory over Finland in a few weeks because the Soviet Army had many more troops, tanks and planes than the Finnish Army. However, the Finnish forces resisted better and much longer than expected. They had good winter clothes and wore white coats, which camouflaged them in the snow. As well, the Finnish soldiers moved around on skis, which made it easy for them to sneak up on the Soviet soldiers. The Soviets did not have good winter clothes, and they wore dark green coats, which were easy to see in the snow. The peace treaty that ended the war in March 1940 left the Finns as a free people. They had to give up 11% of their country and tried to get it back during the Continuation War. ==Related pages== *World War II ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1939 in Europe Category:1940 in Europe Category:1940 events Category:1940s in Finland Category:Wars involving the Soviet Union Category:World War II",
