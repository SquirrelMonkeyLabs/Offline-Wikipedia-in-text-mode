Serebrov flew on Soyuz T-7, Soyuz T-8, Soyuz TM-8 and Soyuz TM-17. He was one of very few cosmonauts to fly for both the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation. He held the record for most spacewalks, 10, until Anatoly Solovyev passed it. Serebrov died suddenly in Moscow, Russia on 12 November 2013, aged 69. He is also known for playing Tetris on a Game Boy in the spacecraft, making it the first time a video game has ever been played in space. ==References== Category:Cosmonauts Category:1944 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Scientists from Moscow Category:Russian aerospace engineers",
