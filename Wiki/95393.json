 "text": "Plumeria (common name Frangipani) is a small genus of 7-8 species that grow in tropical and subtropical Americas. The genus consists of mainly deciduous shrubs and trees. P. rubra (Common Frangipani, Red Frangipani), that grows in Mexico, Central America, and Venezuela, produces flowers ranging from white, yellow to pink. From Mexico and Central America, Plumeria has spread to all tropical areas of the world, especially Hawaii, where it grows so abundantly that many people think that it is native there. == Plant == Plumeria is related to the Oleander, Nerium Oleander, and both possess poisonous, milky sap, rather similar to that of Euphorbia. == Plumeria obtusa Gallery == Image:Flower I IMG 8330.jpg|Flowers Image:Bark I IMG 4179.jpg|Bark Image:Leaves I IMG 8331.jpg|Leaves == Other websites == * Frangipani, Plumeria, Lonely Hearts Posts and New Books to Read! - Informative but non- scholarly essay on Plumeria. * Portuguese Flora Brasiliensis: Plumeria * Dok Champa Muang Lao: Plumeria Flowers, fleurs des frangipaniers, fleurs du Laos.
