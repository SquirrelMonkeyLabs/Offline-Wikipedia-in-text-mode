 "text": "The New York Islanders are an ice hockey team that plays in the National Hockey League (NHL). They were a great team between 1980 and 1983, winning four Stanley Cups and a record 19 consecutive playoff series. The Islanders have played for most of their history in Nassau County, New York on Long Island. They played from 1972 to 2015 at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, then temporarily moved to Brooklyn and the Barclays Center starting with the 2015–16 season. However, Barclays Center proved to be less than desirable as a hockey venue, and the team returned to the Coliseum part-time in 2018–19 and 2019–20 and full-time in 2020–21. In November 2021, the Islanders opened their current home of UBS Arena, next to the Belmont Park horse racing track in Elmont, a community next to the New York City borough of Queens. ==References== Notes ==Other websites== *Official website",
