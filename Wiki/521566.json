This journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of Culture of Health and holistic medicine. In the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the New Age. == Skumin's doctrine of the culture of health == In 1968, when Skumin was still a medical student, he proposed the term ″culture of health″. which has become widespread. The main task of the culture of health is to do health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being. The 'culture of health' means recognizing health’s central importance in life. He referred to the works of Helena Blavatsky, Helena and Nicholas Roerich, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Alexander Chizhevsky. In some of his publications, he argues that the culture of health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society in the Solar System. The doctrine of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture. == Skumin syndrome == Skumin syndrome) was described by Skumin in 1978 as a \"cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome\", associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear and sleep disorder. Patients have doubts about the reliability of the device, fear of breakdown, and suffer anxiety and depression. This syndrome is often accompanied by asthenia. Alain Carpentier – a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the head the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris – believed in 2011 that Skumin syndrome develops in a quarter of the patients with an artificial heart valve. It is possible that a similar problem arises in the conduct of operations to implement an artificial heart. == Skumin mind control method == In 1979, Skumin created a special modification of mind control method for psychological rehabilitation of patients. This method is based on autogenic training. This is a relaxation technique developed by the psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz. He emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures. The technique of the Skumin mind control method involves the use of two standard postures: sitting meditation and lying down meditation. This includes five psychological exercises: the first is \"the relaxation\", the second one is \"the warming\", the third one is \"the zero gravity\", the fourth one is \"the target autosuggestion\", and the fifth exercise is \"the psychological activation\". Each session contain explanation of the theory and practice of each new exercise as it is reached. The therapeutic effect of the Skumin mind control method is achieved by the neutralization of traumatic emotional experiences and the progressive reorganization of the psychic structures to include previously unacceptable mental contents, too. This method of psychotherapy has found application in medical practice, in particular in the treatment of phobias, headaches, etc. == Skumin’s mixture == Skumin’s mixture is a medicine with a sedative effect, affecting the central nervous system.
