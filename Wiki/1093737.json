 "text": "The greenish frilled tree frog (Kurixalus viridescens) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam. People have seen it in Hon Ba Nature Reserve and Bidoup Nui Ba National Park, about 1500 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult female frog is 28.7â€“36.6 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is green in color. Unlike other frogs in Kurixalus, it has no brown or gray marks on its back. It has some yellow color on its sides, legs, and feet. Its belly is lemon yellow in color. This frog has no vomerine teeth in its jaw. ==Name== The scientists gave the frog the Latin name viridescens for its green color. ==Home and threats== This frog lives in evergreen forests close to the tops of hills and mountains. Scientists have not seen eggs or tadpoles, but they think the frog lays eggs in hollow trees with water in them or in small pools where the water does not move. But they did not see the adults near streams or pools. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
