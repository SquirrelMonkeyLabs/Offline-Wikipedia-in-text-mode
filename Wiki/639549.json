 "text": "The Prime Minister (, literally \"Minister of the State\") is the head of government in Sweden. The office was created in 1876. Louis Gerhard De Geer, the architect behind the new bicameral Riksdag of 1866 that replaced the centuries-old Riksdag of the Estates, became the first officeholder in 1876. Until 1974, the executive authority in Sweden had been exercised through the King in Council. Constitutional reform provided a new Instrument of Government which de jure established the parliamentary system and created a cabinet government with constitutional powers not derived from the Crown. The current prime minister is Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderate Party, since 2022. ==Living former Prime Ministers== File:Ingvar Carlsson 2010.jpg|Ingvar Carlsson born served 1986–1991 and 1994–1996 File:Carl Bildt under den politiska Almedalsveckan 2016.jpg|Carl Bildt born served 1991–1994 File:Goran Persson, Sveriges statsminister, under nordiskt statsministermotet i Reykjavik 2005.jpg|Göran Persson born served 1996–2006 File:Fredrik Reinfeldt - Sveriges statsminister 2006-2014.jpg|Fredrik Reinfeldt born served 2006–2014 File:Stefan Löfven (cropped).jpg|Stefan Löfven born served 2014–2021 File:Swedish Prime Minister Andersson (2021).jpg|Magdalena Andersson born served 2021–2022 ==References== ==Other websites== *Prime Minister's Office, official website",
