 "text": "A genetic fallacy is a kind of fallacy where something or someone is judged by its past or its origin rather than what it is in the present. An example of genetic fallacy is the argument, \"people who own Volkswagens are evil because Volkswagen is a car company that was created by the Nazi Party.\" Just because the Nazi Party did create Volkswagen does not mean the Volkswagen Group today (or even people that buy Volkswagen cars) support or promote the ideas or values of Nazism.
