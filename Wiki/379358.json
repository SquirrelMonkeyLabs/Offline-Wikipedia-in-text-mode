The fashion industry in the Western world saw growth during this time. Flappers were a big subculture in the Western world during the 1920s. Flappers were women who wore short skirts, and feathers in their hair, which was usually in a bob. They sometimes smoked and drank, and were very rebellious. Later on, their dresses became fashionable in the 1920s. == References == *Fashion. Compton's by Britannica, v 6.0. 2009. eLibrary. Web. 04 Dec. 2012. *Murphy, Robert. Schiaparelli in Bazaar.
