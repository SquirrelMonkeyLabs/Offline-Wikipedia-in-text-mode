 "text": "Abortion in Michigan is allowed at any time during a pregnancy. In 2022, a new law called Michigan Proposal 22â€“3 was passed by voters. This law makes it clear that people have the right to get an abortion and use birth control, and it was added to the state Constitution. The law means that Michigan cannot create rules to limit abortions before a baby can survive outside the womb, unless those rules are for the person's safety. Before this, a law (Section 750.14) from 1931 made most abortions illegal, but a judge said that law was not valid anymore because of the new amendment.White, Ed (September 7, 2022). \"Judge strikes down 1931 Michigan law criminalizing abortion\" .
