It has never been corrected. The order is given as 1-5-10-8-2-7-4-9-3-11, which leaves out \"Superman\" and \"Underneath the Bunker.\" The track listing is correct on the actual vinyl, cassette, and some CD versions. *Early American pressings of the CD have the track number for \"Cuyahoga\" as \"0R\" instead of \"04\" printed on the disc itself. This error resurfaces on the cover of Green. *On the vinyl and cassette releases, R.E.M. labeled side one (tracks 1–6) as the \"Dinner side\" and side two (tracks 7–12) as the \"Supper side.\" *The European 'I.R.S. Years Vintage 1986' release preserves the erroneous track list, but properly lists the bonus tracks. ==References== Category:1986 albums Category:R.E.M. albums",
