 "text": "Kesaria Abramidze (; 18 August 1987 â€“ 18 September 2024) was a Georgian blogger, actress and model. She was the first person in the country to publicly admit to being transgender. She was born in Tbilisi, then-Georgian SSR. Before transitioning, Abramidze's genetic material was frozen outside the country. She announced that she had undergone gender-affirming surgery in 2014. Abramidze was a guest on several shows, such as in Psychopath Games and Davit Kovziridze's show Zhure Katsat. She took part in the Miss Trans Global beauty pageant and represented Georgia. She later became a television host for Rustavi 2. Abramidze was stabbed to death on 18 September 2024 at her home near Tbilisi, aged 37. Her death happened one day after the Parliament of Georgia passed an anti-LGBTQ+ bill. The next day, her ex-boyfriend was arrested at Kutaisi International Airport in connection to Abramidze's murder. Some commentators and politicians connected Abramidze's murder to the new anti-LGBTQ+ law. President Salome Zurabishvili and the UN Human Rights Office both condemned the murder and asked to new laws to protect LGBTQ+ individuals. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Actors from Tbilisi Category:Writers from Tbilisi Category:LGBT models Category:LGBT actors Category:Bloggers Category:Transgender women Category:Murder victims Category:Murders by blade weapons",
