A nuclear family is a part of an extended family. ==History== The term nuclear family was first used in 1947.Merriam-Webster Online. \"Definition of nuclear family\". However, people have lived in nuclear families for thousands of years. In 2005, archaeologists discovered four 4,600-year-old graves in Germany. Several adults and children who were related were buried in these graves. Researchers think that this proves that people lived in nuclear families a long time ago. During and before the medieval period in Europe, large family groups, such as clans, were most common.Grief, Avner (2005). \"Family Structure, Institutions, and Growth: The Origin and Implications of Western Corporatism\" . By the late medieval period, the nuclear family had become most common. ==References== Category:Anthropology Category:Sociology Category:Social groups Category:Family",
