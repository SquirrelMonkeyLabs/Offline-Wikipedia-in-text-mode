 "text": "Willan's Formula is a formula that can find the nth prime number. 1+\\sum_{i=1}^{2^n}{\\lfloor(\\frac{n}{\\sum_{j=1}^i{\\lfloor(\\cos{\\pi\\frac{{(j-1)!}+j}{j}})^2\\rfloor}})^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\rfloor} == Proof == Let's first start with the \\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j}. Wilson's theorem says if {(j-1)!+1} is divisible by j, than j is either a prime number or 1, meaning when j is prime, \\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j} is an integer. It would be much easier if the formula gives a number instead of checking if the number is an integer, and we can do this with the {\\lfloor(\\cos{\\pi\\frac{{(j-1)!}+j}{j}})^2\\rfloor} part. The reason the formula has \\pi multiplied by the \\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j} part is because when \\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j} is an integer, \\cos(\\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j}\\pi) will give 1 or -1. When squaring the result then \\cos(\\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j}\\pi) will equal 1 when \\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j} is an integer. By flooring this, the only results are 1 when \\frac{(j-1)!+1}{j} is an integer and 0 when it isn't, leaving{\\lfloor(\\cos{\\pi\\frac{{(j-1)!}+j}{j}})^2\\rfloor}. The \\sum_{j=1}^i{\\lfloor(\\cos{\\pi\\frac{{(j-1)!}+j}{j}})^2\\rfloor} will add 1s for the primes 1 \\- i and and will sum up to the (\\mathbin{\\\\#} \\textrm{primes}\\leq{i})+1. The {\\lfloor(\\frac{n}{\\sum_{j=1}^i{\\lfloor(\\cos{\\pi\\frac{{(j-1)!}+j}{j}})^2\\rfloor}})^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\rfloor} in short will give 1 if n>(\\mathbin{\\\\#} \\textrm{primes}\\leq{i}) and 0 when n\\geq(\\mathbin{\\\\#} \\textrm{primes}\\leq{i}). Take the p(x) of both sides where p(x) is the nth prime number: 1 when nth \\textrm{prime}>i \\Rightarrow{i}<{nth} \\textrm{prime} 0 when nth \\textrm{prime}\\leq{i} \\Rightarrow{i} \\geq{nth} \\textrm{prime} \\sum_{i=1}^{2^n}{\\lfloor(\\frac{n}{\\sum_{j=1}^i{\\lfloor(\\cos{\\pi\\frac{{(j-1)!}+j}{j}})^2\\rfloor}})^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\rfloor} gives the number -1, and the -1 is because when i<{nth} \\textrm{prime} reaches i ={nth} \\textrm{prime}, the function doesn't add 1. The formula adds up to 2^n is because Bertrand's postulate says 2^n is bigger than the nth prime number. And finally, 1 is added because of the -1. == References == Category:Prime numbers",
