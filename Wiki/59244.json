What she saw was written in books, for example, The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord, Jesus Christ. The book later had an important part as a main source of information for Mel Gibson's movie The Passion of the Christ. == Stigmata == She was stuck in bed when marks of stigmata showed up she had doctors and physicians examine her markings, and it was found to be a genuine stigmatic case. == Other websites == Sister Emmerich and Gibson Category:1774 births Category:1824 deaths Category:German Roman Catholics Category:Nuns Category:Stigmata",
