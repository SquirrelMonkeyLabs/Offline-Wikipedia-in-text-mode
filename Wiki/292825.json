 "text": "Rainbow (also known as Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow or Blackmore's Rainbow) were an English hard rock band, controlled by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore from 1975 to 1984 and 1994 to 1997. It was originally established with former Elf members, though over the years Rainbow went through many line-up changes with no two studio albums featuring the same line-up. In addition to lead singers Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, Joe Lynn Turner and Doogie White, the project consisted of numerous backing musicians. The band started out combining mystical lyric themes with neo-classical metal, but went in a more streamlined commercial style following Dio's departure from the group. Rainbow was ranked #90 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. ==Band members== ;Core member *Ritchie Blackmore – guitar (1975–1984, 1994–1997) ;Other members *Ronnie James Dio – lead vocals (1975–1978) *Craig Gruber – bass (1975) *Micky Lee Soule – keyboards (1975) *Gary Driscoll – drums (1975) *Jimmy Bain – bass (1975–1977) *Tony Carey – keyboards (1975–1977) *Cozy Powell – drums (1975–1980) *Mark Clarke – bass (1977) *Bob Daisley – bass, backing vocals (1977–1978) *David Stone – keyboards (1977–1978) *Jack Green – bass (1978–1979) *Graham Bonnet – lead vocals (1979–1980) *Roger Glover – bass, backing vocals (1979–1984) *Don Airey – keyboards, backing vocals (1979–1981) *Joe Lynn Turner – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1980–1984) *Bobby Rondinelli – drums (1980–1983) *David Rosenthal – keyboards (1981–1984) *Chuck Burgi – drums (1983–1984, 1995–1997) *Doogie White – lead vocals (1994–1997) *Greg Smith – bass, backing vocals (1994–1997) *Paul Morris – keyboards (1994–1997) *John O'Reilly – drums (1994–1995) *John Micelli – drums (1997) ==Discography== *Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (1975) *Rising (1976) *On Stage (1977) *Long Live Rock 'n' Roll (1978) *Down to Earth (1979) *Difficult to Cure (1981) *Straight Between the Eyes (1982) *Bent Out of Shape (1983) *Finyl Vinyl (1986) *Stranger in Us All (1995) ==References== ==Other websites== *The Rainbow Fanclan Legacy Category:1980s music groups Category:1990s music groups Category:English hard rock bands",
