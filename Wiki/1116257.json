 "text": "The Babar Deva (1885–1924) (Hindi: बाबर देवा) was a notorious and infamous dacoit who was born in the Koli family of Gorelgaon in Borsad taluka of Anand district in Gujarat. Like his father, Babar Deva was an outlaw. He murdered and robbed many people in Gujarat. == Crimes == Babar's first murder victim was the Patel (Mukhiya) of his village, who was a Patidar by caste. After committing at least 23 more murders, he discovered that his family members were giving information to the British government in India, and killed them all. Babar also cut off the noses of other people who had given information to the British government about him. Babar evaded capture for several years. But after he robbed the house of a Patidar in Kaniyagaon of Petlad taluka, he was caught by the army of the princely state of Baroda and was imprisoned in Petlad jail. After escaping from jail in 1919, he committed two major robberies and some murders. In 1920, the same year he killed his sister for informing to the British government, he made fifteen big dacoits by forming a big gang. == Reform == In 1922, Babar changed himself and befriended a social reformer. She worked to help the poor, and gradually Babar began to do the same. He vowed to rob British officers and treasury instead of killing and robbing regular people. He never harassed women, children, or poor people. He gave money to poor farmers for marriage and for digging wells, after which people considered him a messiah. In the middle of the year 1923, Babar organized a festival in his village, fed the cows, and gave sweets to the children. He also provided protection to the jagirdars. Babar Deva also supported Mahatma Gandhi's movement. == References == Category:Koli people Category:1885 births Category:1923 deaths",
