 "text": "Los Lonely Boys are an American musical group from San Angelo, Texas. They play a style of music they call \"Texican Rock n' Roll\", combining elements of rock and roll, Texas blues, brown-eyed soul, country, and Tejano music. The band consists of three brothers: Henry (guitar, vocals), Jojo (bass guitar, vocals), and Ringo (drums, vocals) Garza Sr. They follow the tradition of their father, Enrique Garza, who formed a band with his brothers called the Falcones. The Falcones played conjunto music in South Texas during the 1970s and 1980s. The debut single by Los Lonely Boys, \"Heaven\", was a number-one hit on the Billboard adult contemporary chart and reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2004. In 2009, they signed to an Austin-based indie label, Playing in Traffic Records, and released an EP, 1969, and three albums under their LonelyTone imprint, Keep On Giving: Acoustic Live!, Rockpango, and their newest release, Revelation.
