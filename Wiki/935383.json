 "text": "Edwardian architecture refers to the architectural styles that was popular for public buildings in the British Empire during the Edwardian era from 1901 to 1910. The main style is watered-down baroque. Architecture up to 1914 (until the start of World War I) is commonly included in this style. Edwardian architecture is generally less detailed than high or late Victorian architecture. The Victorian Society campaigns to preserve architecture built between 1837 and 1914, and so includes Edwardian as well as Victorian architecture. == References == == Other websites == *Edwardian Architecture (1901-14) Category:Architectural styles Category:20th-century architecture Category:British Empire",
