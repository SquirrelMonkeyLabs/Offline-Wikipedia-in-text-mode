 "text": "Gabriel Rufián Romero (born 8 February 1982) is a Spanish politician and activist. In the Spanish general election, 2015 and 2016 he led the Republican Left of Catalonia, a pro-independence electoral party. He is also a member of the secretariat of the Assemblea Nacional Catalana and a member of Súmate, two other pro-independence groups. In the 2016 general election, he was elected to the Congress of Deputies for the constituency of Barcelona. The presence of Rufián in the ERC list has been suggested to be a case of tokenism. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Barcelona",
