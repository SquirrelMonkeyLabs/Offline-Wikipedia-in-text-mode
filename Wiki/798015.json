 "text": "Hawaiian Pidgin, known locally as Pidgin, is a creole language from Hawaii. It is based off of English, but is mixed with other languages like Hawaiian, Japanese, Ilocano, Chinese, Portuguese, etc. It is spoken by many Hawaii locals, though many also speak standard English. The original Hawaiian language is spoken by some. Hawaiian Pidgin can largely be understood by English speakers, and many Pidgin speakers mix Pidgin with English. While many Hawaii locals see Pidgin as a dialect, it has recently been seen as a language by the US government. == Words == Hawaiian Pidgin Standard English ono delicious hamajang messed up, broken habut grumpy hanabaddah mucus pau done, finished kau kau eat howzit hello bumbai otherwise, or else tarantan boastful lua/benjo toilet lolo stupid da kine whatchamacalit, thingamajigger hana hou finished work == References == Category:Languages of the United States Category:Hawaii Category:Pidgins and creoles Category:English-based pidgins",
