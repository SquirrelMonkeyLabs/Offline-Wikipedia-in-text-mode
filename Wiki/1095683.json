 "text": "The World Open is a snooker tournament. It started out in 1982 as the Professional Players Tournament, but for most of the 1980s and 1990s it was known as the Grand Prix. It was renamed the LG Cup from 2001 to 2003. It was then the Grand Prix until 2010. Since then it has been known as the World Open. During 2006 and 2007, it was played in a round-robin format. The knock- out format returned in 2008 with an FA Cup-style draw. The random draw was abandoned after the 2010 edition. Judd Trump is the reigning champion, having won the tournament the last two times it was held, in 2019 and 2024. ==Winners== Year Winner Runner-up Final score Venue City Season Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) Professional Players Tournament (ranking, 1982–1983) 1982 10–5 La Reserve & International Snooker Club Birmingham, England 1982/83 1983 9–8 Redwood Lodge Bristol, England 1983/84 Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) Grand Prix (ranking, 1984–2000) 1984 10–2 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1984/85 1985 10–9 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1985/86 1986 10–6 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1986/87 1987 10–7 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1987/88 1988 10–6 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1988/89 1989 10–0 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1989/90 1990 10–5 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1990/91 1991 10–6 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1991/92 1992 10–9 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1992/93 1993 9–6 Hexagon Theatre Reading, England 1993/94 1994 9–6 Assembly Rooms Derby, England 1994/95 1995 9–5 Crowtree Centre Sunderland, England 1995/96 1996 9–5 Bournemouth International Centre Bournemouth, England 1996/97 1997 9–6 Bournemouth International Centre Bournemouth, England 1997/98 1998 9–2 Guild Hall Preston, England 1998/99 1999 9–8 Guild Hall Preston, England 1999/00 2000 9–5 Telford International Centre Telford, England 2000/01 LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) LG Cup (ranking, 2001–2003) 2001 9–4 Guild Hall Preston, England 2001/02 2002 9–5 Guild Hall Preston, England 2002/03 2003 9–5 Guild Hall Preston, England 2003/04 Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) Grand Prix (ranking, 2004–2009) 2004 9–5 Guild Hall Preston, England 2004/05 2005 9–2 Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre Aberdeen, Scotland 2005/06 2006 9–5 Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre Aberdeen, Scotland 2006/07 2007 9–6 Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre Aberdeen, Scotland 2007/08 2008 9–7 Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre Glasgow, Scotland 2008/09 2009 9–4 Kelvin Hall Glasgow, Scotland 2009/10 World Open (ranking, 2010) World Open (ranking, 2010) World Open (ranking, 2010) World Open (ranking, 2010) World Open (ranking, 2010) World Open (ranking, 2010) World Open (ranking, 2010) 2010 5–1 Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre Glasgow, Scotland 2010/11 Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) Haikou World Open (ranking, 2012–2014) 2012 10–1 Haikou Stadium Haikou, China 2011/12 2013 10–4 Hainan International Convention And Exhibition Center Haikou, China 2012/13 2014 10–6 Hainan International Convention And Exhibition Center Haikou, China 2013/14 World Open (ranking, 2016–present) World Open (ranking, 2016–present) World Open (ranking, 2016–present) World Open (ranking, 2016–present) World Open (ranking, 2016–present) World Open (ranking, 2016–present) World Open (ranking, 2016–present) 2016 10–8 Yushan No.1 Middle School Yushan, China 2016/17 2017 10–3 Yushan No.1 Middle School Yushan, China 2017/18 2018 10–9 Yushan No.1 Middle School Yushan, China 2018/19 2019 10–5 Yushan Sport Centre Yushan, China 2019/20 2020–2023 Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic Cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2024 10–4 Yushan Sport Centre Yushan, China 2023/24 ==References== Category:Snooker tournaments",
