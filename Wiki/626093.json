 "text": "Talarurus ( ; meaning \"Wicker tail\") is an extinct genus of ankylosaur dinosaur. It lived about 90 million years ago during the Upper Cretaceous in what is now Mongolia. Talarurus was a hippopotamus-sized, heavily built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore. It could grow up to about long. Like other ankylosaurs it had heavy armour and a club on its tail. Talarurus is one of the oldest known ankylosaurines from Asia and one of the better-known ankylosaurs from Mongolia.Park J.Y; Lee Y.N; Currie P.J; Kobayashi Y; Koppelhus E; Barsbold R; Mateus O; Lee S. & Kim S.H. 2019.
