 "text": "Propaganda was a very important tool that the German Nazi Party used. They started to use it in 1920. This was after they stopped being named the German Worker’s Party (DAP). They still used it right before Germany gave up World War II in May 1945. The propaganda got more used and more seen over time. This was because the Nazis got more power over time. The propaganda was even seen in other places that were not Germany. Adolf Hitler made a book named Mein Kampf in 1925. It gave ideas and ways of doing things. The Nazis used the ideas and ways after some time. The Völkischer Beobachter and Der Angriff were newspapers (papers that say the news) at the time. They gave ideas and knowledge. The newspapers were used for propaganda when the Nazis were first made. There were books, boards, papers, camera pictures, art, moving pictures, and played sounds used as propaganda after that. German people had Nazi ideas because the Nazis made so much propaganda. The ideas said many things. Some of the things are: Nazi ideas are good for families, people need knowledge of places that are not Germany, Jews are bad, places that are not Germany are bad, people that are not Nazis are bad, people need to have certain good qualities, and that Germany needs war against the Allied Nations. Germany gave up the war against other governments. Then, the governments that were against Germany stopped all Nazi propaganda and all Nazi groups. This was at the time of denazification (stopping all Nazi things).",
