 "text": "In Christianity, one way people think of God is as a being that made everything and lives forever. The Christian Bible speaks of God as one who is, who speaks, who sees, hears, acts, and loves. Christians believe that God has a will and is a kind, all powerful being. Some Christians believe God to be immanent (with and inside all things). Others believe he will be immanent later. Most believe he is also transcendent (outside space and time, so he is unable to be changed by forces inside the universe).Machen, J. Gresham. God Transcendent. Banner of Truth publishers, 1998. Trinitarians see the Christian God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. They say that God is one being that lives forever, who is inside and beyond nature. All Christian denominations say that God is personal to humans and to himself. Most of the Christians believe that God is a spirit. ==Names for God== In the Hebrew Bible, God is referred to by the personal name YHWH, which commonly stylized a Yahweh. The name YHWH is sometimes Latinized as Jehovah, especially by Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons. ==God seen by people== God is not seen often by people in the Bible. God is seen: *By Adam and Eve to give them rules *By Adam and Eve to punish them for breaking the rules *By Moses as a burning bush *By Moses as a pillar of flames == Referencing == Category:Christian theology",
