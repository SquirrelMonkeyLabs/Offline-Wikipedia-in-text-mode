 "text": "Dawlish () is a town on the south coast of Devon, South West England. It is 12 miles from the County town of Exeter. The town has a population of around 13,000 people. During the eighteenth century, it grew from a small fishing port to become a well-known seaside resort. The Great Western Railway runs along the sea. It is the main line to Cornwall. In 2014 a storm washed it away and it was closed for 8 weeks. It has now been reinforced with a much stronger sea wall. Dawlish was one of the pumping stations for Isambard Kingdom Brunel's atmospheric railway which opened in 1846. == Other websites == * infodawlish.co.uk An informative look at the Town & Businesses of Dawlish * Dawlish (DMOZ.org) ==References== Category:Towns in Devon Category:Teignbridge",
