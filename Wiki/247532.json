 "text": "The Gaza flotilla raid happened on 31 May 2010. It was in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Israeli naval forces seized an aid flotilla of six ships carrying 663 or 682 pro-Palestinian activists from 37 nations, known as the \"Gaza Freedom Flotilla\". The activists were trying to breach the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian supplies. During the event, Israeli military forces seized a convoy of six ships carrying goods which should be brought to the Palestinian territories in the form of aid. There were 663-682 people on board these ships. The ships were headed to the port of Gaza. Israel had offered them to land at a different port so that the aid could be inspected, but the crew had declined this offer. During the incident, at least nine people were killed. ==The regional overview== The Gaza strip is part of Palestine. It is amongst the most densely populated areas on Earth. About 1.5 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 km². The Palestinian Authority says that this is an occupied territory. They say, Israel is the occupation force, and it should withdraw and give the territory back to the Palestinians. Israel has attacked and bombed Gaza several times. Israel does not see things this way since they gave over the territory to the Palestinian administration in 2005 and have pulled back their troops over time. Meanwhile, Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the territory, has launched rockets at Israel. Hamas took over the Gaza Strip after the Fatah–Hamas conflict that was after the 2006 Palestinian elections Israel said Hamas to be a terrorist movement. Egypt did not agree with Hamas removing the Palestinian Authority officials from Gaza. The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip was said to be a safety measure by Israel, but the Free Gaza Movement is opposed. Hamas, along with other groups, had been causing trouble there and in southern parts of Israel. The block started in 2007. Many countries (like Egypt) feel sorry for the Gaza Strip, a few others (like Iran) hate or somehow fear Israel and some (like the USA) agree with Israel. ==The ships' route == The Turkish passenger ship Cruse Liner MV Mavi Marmara was trying to take Turkish and Cypriot aid to the Gaza Strip on May the 31st when the Israeli Navy found it. The 3-year-old blockade was upheld by Flotilla 13. When it was raided, the Mavi Marmara was 40 miles from the Gaza Strip. 27 British activists, 9 Palestinian, 8 Turks, 2 Irish, 1 Swedish, 1 South African, 1 American and 1 Albanian were on the Mavi Marmara, along with a few others. The Mavi Marmara was followed by the Irish passenger ship MV Rachel Corrie and 4 other minor vessels. The ships carried a total of 663-682 activists and aid workers, including several Turks, several Malaysians another American, an Australian, and a Belgian. There were, in total, 663 or 683 people from 37 nations on board the 6 ships in the civilian flotilla. Notable people included Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan, former UN Assistant Secretary-General Denis Halliday, Israeli-Arab member of Knesset Haneen Zoubi, leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel Raed Salah, Swedish novelist Henning Mankell, and a number of politicians from European and Arab national governments and the European Parliament. ==The raid== Israel said that the other 5 ships were boarded and taken over peacefully, and that the only incidents took place in the Mavi Marmara, but many reports that several people from the other ships were also wounded. The flotilla had planned to break through the Gaza blockade, ignoring Israel's plan for the activists to stop at the port of Ashdod and transfer the cargo through there. After they ignored repeated calls to give in, soldiers from the Shayetet 13 (Flotilla 13) unit boarded the ships at around 04:00 IST The convoy organizers Arafat Shoukriof, of the Free Gaza Movement (FGM), said the Israeli military story was not true. One of the co-organizers of the flotilla convoy said those on board one ship had called them by telephone to say that Israeli helicopters had arrived to do a surprise raid. === The MV Mavi Marmara is raided=== The boarding of the Mavi Marmara resulted in violent clashes between activists and Israeli soldiers, though the details are disputed. An Israeli helicopter dropped 30 specialist soldiers on to the ship. Fighting then broke out. An Israeli trooper was thrown over the side of the ship, some aid workers rioted and threw chairs at the Israelis. The Israelis then used tear gas, tasers, stun grenades and smoke bombs. Later several gun shots were fired by both sides. Finally, at the end of it all, an Albanian woman fell over the ship's side. The soldiers, who used stun grenades, then asked for government permission to use their firearms, which they then received.Israeli convoy raid: What went wrong?
