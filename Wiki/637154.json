They marry, but the family rejects them. Two years later, when Shorvori gets pregnant, the family accepts them back. After a miscarriage that makes Shorvori unable to have children, they keep the news from the family to avoid sadness. They choose Teni (Jasmin Bhasin), a fun-loving girl, to be a surrogate mother. Teni agrees in exchange for a chance to go to America. She becomes pregnant through IVF, and Shorvori introduces her to the family as her cousin. The family is suspicious of Teni, and Sejal (Himani Sharma) tries to expose her. Teni pretends to be in a relationship with Parth's friend, Aman (Kunal Verma), to avoid getting engaged to someone else. Aman falls in love with Teni and proposes to her, and she agrees for the chance to go to America. Parth's family does a ritual for the unborn baby, and Teni starts to realize she loves Parth. She confesses her feelings to him, but this leads to complications. When the truth about the surrogacy is revealed, the family initially banishes Parth, Shorvori, and Teni but later accepts them back. Shorvori begins to feel insecure about Parth and Teni's growing closeness. She leaves the house, pretending to hate Parth and Teni. Teni learns that Shorvori has a brain tumor and is trying to make Parth and the family hate her so that Teni can take care of Parth after she dies. Shorvori sends divorce papers to Parth and has him arrested. The family supports Teni in her decision to leave the house with the unborn baby. Shorvori meets with a car accident and dies. Parth initially does not believe Shorvori is dead, but he sees her body and is heartbroken. Teni gives birth to a baby girl named Ipshita.
