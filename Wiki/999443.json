 "text": "Jim Dine (June 16, 1935) is an American artist. Dine was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1935. He went to the University of Cincinnati and the Boston Museum School. He got a BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts degree) at Ohio University in 1957. In 1958 Dine moved to New York City. He worked on Happenings with artist Claes Oldenburg, composer John Cage, and others. Happenings were disorderly \"performances that took place around the city ... away from the areas traditionally associated with art museums and galleries.\" In the 1960s he became famous for painting bathrobes. He said, \"I was looking for a way to do self-portraits without painting my face. I saw this bathrobe in an ad. It had no one in itâ€”but it looked like my shape, so it became a sort of metaphor for me.\" In the 1970s drawing became more important to him than painting. He used common objects such as tools, hearts, trees, birds. These objects \"are easily understood by the viewer, while also suggesting deeper layers of meaning.\" Dine's art is in the permanent collections of many museums. Some of them are: * Art Institute of Chicago * Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, ME * Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn * Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland * Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge * Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York * Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis * Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago * Museum of Fine Arts, Boston * Museum of Modern Art, New York * National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. * Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York * Whitney Museum of American Art, New York * Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam * Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT ==References== == Other websites == *Jim Dine at PennSound Category:1935 births Category:American painters Category:American artists Category:Living people",
