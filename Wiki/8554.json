 "text": "Foreign aid is one country helps another country, usually a poorer country, by giving money, supplies, or sending people to help during a disaster. Some aid is for supporting economic development and help those in need, especially in places where wealthy countries and companies often shape trade, rules, and spread of money to their own benefit. Sometimes foreign aid is given to protect the donor countryâ€™s own interests by influencing politics or supporting their own businesses abroad. Experts say that helping people meet their basic needs through aid can reduce the chances of them joining dangerous groups or being forced to flee their homes. This aid not only comes from a country's government, but sometimes a country's ordinary people also donate. Charities play a major role and deliver food, clean water, and healthcare services in developing countries. The poorer countries are called LEDCs (Less Economically Developed Countries). The richer countries are called MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries). The United Nations and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development also work for such aid for poorer countries. == References == Category:International relations",
