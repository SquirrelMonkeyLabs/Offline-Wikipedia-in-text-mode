 "text": "The Roma, also known as the Romani, are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group concentrated in parts of Europe. Their origins can be traced to South Asia, likely in the regions of present-day Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan and Sindh.Hübschmannová, Milena (1995). \"Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku\". Bulletin Muzea Romské Kultury (April 1995). \"Romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou.\" [The Romani lexicon is closer to Hindi, Marwari, Punjabi, etc., in the grammatical sphere we find many similarities with the East Indian language, with Bengali.] Their first wave of westward migration is believed to have taken place around the 6th century, first arriving in Europe around the 9th century, via the Balkans. ==Genetics== Genetic studies show that the Roma share ancestry with various groups from the Indian subcontinent. The studies prove this by finding similarities between DNA patterns in the different groups. * * * * * * ===Research=== Genetic studies have found similarities between the DNA of Roma and: * Jats * Dalits * Brahmins * People from Sindh * South Indian Tamils * The Chandala and Shudra castes ===Further evidence=== Romani newborns from various countries have a birthmark called the \"Mongolian spot\", which is common in Asia. Many Romani men from the Zargari tribe in Qazvin Province and Iran are born with a rare condition called aposthia, where the foreskin is missing or very short. ===Genetic changes=== After the Ottoman Empire conquered the Balkans and Byzantine Empire, Roma intermarried with Ottoman Turks. When they had children, DNA from the Roma and the Turks mixed together. This is called gene flow. After residing in the Balkans for centuries, they migrated throughout Europe, and from Europe to other parts of the globe. The degree of European ancestry amongst Roma, obtained via intermarriages, varies substantially. ==Early history== Historians believe that the remnants from the Indo-Greeks, the Atsinganos left the Indian subcontinent as traders. During the European migration period in the 4th to 6th centuries, they traveled through the Byzantine Empire into Egypt, using the Silk Road. They lived in Egypt for centuries. Around the 12th or 13th centuries – following the Crusades – the Roma reached the Balkans. From there, the Roma spread across Western Europe. They crossed Europe aboard large caravans, which contained all of their belongings. ==Persecution== The Roma have been victims of persecution and systemic discrimination in Europe for centuries. * * * * * * * * * * * The persecutions were mostly motivated by anti-Romani sentiment, academically known as antiziganism. * * The Egyptians Act of 1530 forced the Roma to leave England. Around 10,000 of these people went to the Ottoman Empire and became Muslims. Their descendants still call themselves Egyptians. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted an official definition for antiziganism on October 8, 2020: Working definition of antigypsyism/anti-Roma discrimination * Distorting or denying persecution of Roma or the genocide of the Roma. * Glorifying the genocide of the Roma. * Inciting, justifying, and perpetrating violence against Roma communities, their property, and individual Roma. * Forced and coercive sterilizations as well as other physically and psychologically abusive treatment of Roma. * Perpetuating and affirming discriminatory stereotypes of and against Roma. * Blaming Roma, using hate speech, for real or perceived social, political, cultural, economic and public health problems. * Stereotyping Roma as persons who engage in criminal behavior. * Using the term “Gypsy” as a slur. * Approving or encouraging exclusionary mechanisms directed against Roma on the basis of racially discriminatory assumptions, such as the exclusion from regular schools and institutional procedures or policies that lead to the segregation of Roma communities. * Enacting policies without legal basis or establishing the conditions that allow for the arbitrary or discriminatory displacement of Roma communities and individuals. * Holding Roma collectively responsible for the real or perceived actions of individual members of Roma communities. * Spreading hate speech against Roma communities in whatever form, for example in media, including on the internet and on social networks. ==Genocide== During the Holocaust, Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany committed a genocide against the Roma. The Romani genocide has been called \"the forgotten Holocaust.\" The Nazis thought the Roma were an 'inferior race' – not as good as other ethnic groups – and they wanted to kill all of the Roma in Europe. * * * * * They persecuted the Roma, executed them in large groups, deported them to concentration camps, used them for medical experiments, and killed them in death camps. 250,000‒500,000 were killed in the Roma genocide. * * * * * * * * * * * Some historians give a higher death toll estimate, ranging from 800,000 to 1,500,000. ==Today== The Roma still experience discrimination and antiziganism. In some countries, they are not accepted in workplaces and schools. Their squatting communities also irritate locals. The Roma created an association in 1978 to defend their rights. The largest Roma populations today live in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. However, there are populations of Roma all over Europe, including: * The Kaló in Spain * The Sinti in Germany * The Romanlar in Turkey * The Ciganos in Portugal * The Romanichals of Britain * The Gitans of southern France * The Manouches in France and Catalonia ==Culture== Roma culture differs from country to country, from group to group, and from religion to religion. Roma cuisine also differs from country to country. Music has always been important in Roma culture. Musical instruments like guitars and violins are an important part of Roma traditions. The Roma influenced musical and dance styles in Europe, such as belly dancing, flamenco, rumba and jazz. Most Roma enter into arranged marriages with other Roma at a very young age. It is rare for Roma to marry gadje (non-Romas). Some groups ban cousin marriage. On 8 April 1971, the Roma nationality was legally recognized in Europe. Since then, 8 April is the International Day of the Roma. ==Language== The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages made the Romani language an official language in many European countries. ==Religion== In ancient times, the Roma followed Hinduism and Buddhism. Today, most follow Eastern Orthodox Christianity. However, many are Muslim. The Dasikane (Christian Roma) practice baptism, while the Xoraxane, or Muslim Roma, practice male circumcision. Other Romani people around the world practice faiths including: * Islam * Bahá'í * Sufism * Hinduism * Palmistry * Buddhism * Witchcraft * Romanipen * Catholicism * Mormonism * Evangelical Christianity Other Romani people practice Noahidism, a Jewish new religious movement based on Orthodox Judaism..and a set of moral laws called the Noahide Laws). People who live according to the Noahide Laws are called children of Noah (B'nei Noach) Noahids. ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Nomadic people Category:Ethnic groups in Europe",
