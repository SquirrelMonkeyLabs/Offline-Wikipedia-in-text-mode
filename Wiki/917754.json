His Bollywood debut came with the romantic drama Tere Mere Sapne (1996), which movie he got his first offer to act in Amitabh Bachchan's first production. Over the next six years Arshad starred in several more films, but most of them failed to do well at the box office until 2003 when he starred in the comedy film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., which was a huge success at the box office and garnered him critical acclaim and nominated for a Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. He has since appeared in several successful films like Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005), Salaam Namaste (2005), Golmaal: Fun Unlimited (2006), Kabul Express (2006), Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006), Dhamaal (2007), Golmaal Returns (2008) etc. == Sources == Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Indian movie actors",
