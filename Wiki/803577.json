 "text": "Lupo (December 2011November 2020) was an English Cocker Spaniel owned by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. He appeared in photographs alongside his owners' son, Prince George of Cambridge. Lupo was bred from Ella, a dog owned by Michael and Carole Middleton, the parents of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. There was an increase of 50% in the searches on its \"Find A Puppy\" website in the months following the Royal couple's announcement of their ownership of Lupo. This increased interest has also had the effect of an increase in thefts of English Cocker Spaniels. Lupo died in November 2020, of unknown causes aged 8 years 11 months. ==References== Category:2020 deaths Category:Individual dogs Category:2011 births",
