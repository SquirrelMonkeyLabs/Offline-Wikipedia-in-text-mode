 "text": "SMILE (Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Explorer) is a planned mission by the European Space Agency and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. SMILE will for the first time take a picture of the Sun's magnetosphere. The questions that SMILE will answer are: * What are the versions of the dayside solar wind or the magnetosphere interaction? * What is the substorm cycle? * Ho do the coronal mass ejection storms arise and what is their connection to solar substorms? As of March 2025, SMILE is going to launch in late 2025. == Instruments == SXI- A wide-field telescope for SMILE UVI - An ultraviolet camera for SMILE LIA - Light Ion Analyser MAG - A magnetometer for SMILE",
