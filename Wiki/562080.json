 "text": "Gateway drug theory is the idea that once a person uses one illegal drug, they are more likely to use other drugs. It is also called stepping-stone theory, escalation hypothesis, or progression hypothesis. If the gateway theory is true, people who use one drug may be more likely to use other drugs because: * Using the first drug changed their brain * They have similar attitudes about using different drugs The gateway theory helps shape education and lawmaking about drugs. Scientific study of the possible causes of the gateway theory is important for health policy. ==References== Category:Illegal drugs Category:Addiction",
