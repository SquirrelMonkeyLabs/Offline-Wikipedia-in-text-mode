Roper (eds.) Cephalopods of the world. An annotated and illustrated catalogue of species known to date. Volume 2. Myopsid and Oegopsid Squids. FAO Species Catalogue for Fishery Purposes No. 4, Vol. 2. FAO, Rome. pp. 148–178. The colossal squid is bigger than a giant squid. Its body is reddish brown and it lives up to 2000m below the surface of the Southern Ocean. It is the main food eaten by sperm whales. The colossal squid has ammonium chloride in its body, so it tastes bad for humans. It is believed to feed on prey such as chaetognatha, large fish like the Patagonian toothfish and other squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence. The colossal squid is thought to have a slow metabolic rate, requiring only around 30 g of prey daily.Rosa R. & B.A. Seibel 2010. Slow pace of life of the Antarctic colossal squid. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, published online 20 April 2010. Cambridge Journals Online - Abstract Estimates of its energetic demands suggest that it is a slow-moving ambush predator, using its large eyes primarily for prey detection rather than active hunting.Bourton, J. 2010. Monster colossal squid is slow not fearsome predator. BBC Earth News 7 May 2010. The eye is 27 cm (10.63 in) wide, with a lens 12 cm across. This is the largest eye of any known animal. These measurements are of the partly collapsed specimen: when living the eye was probably 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 in) across.World's biggest squid reveals 'beach ball' eyes AFP, via Google. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is displaying this specimen in an exhibition which opened in 2008. A website on the squid specimen is also available. == References == Category:Cephalopods",
