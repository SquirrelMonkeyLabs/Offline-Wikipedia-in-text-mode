 "text": "Pasanda () is a popular Shahi Moghlai meat dish in the Indian subcontinent. It is especially famous in North India, Rampur, Hyderabad and Pakistan. It originated from the food served at the court of the Mughal emperors. The word is an alternative from of the Urdu word \"pasande\" which means \"favorite\". The main part of the meat traditionally used in cooking is called pasanda. == Ingredients and preparation == Pasanda is usually made with leg of lamb or goat. These are cut into thin long pieces, flattened, marinated and fried with spices. Pasandas in Pakistan are usually made by cutting a slice of beef into thin, long pieces and flattening them. At present, pasanda is also made using chicken and shrimp. However, although the type of meat is different, the cooking process and the rest of the ingredients are usually the same in each case.Beef Fillets (Pasanday) Recipe After the meat is cut and flattened, it is placed in a jar containing yogurt, chilli powder, and many spices and fries. The spices usually include cumin, chilli powder, cardamom and garlic. After a few hours of marination, the meat is put together in a cooking pot with a few other ingredients to make pasanda. Ingredients are onion, coriander, pepper, and sometimes cinnamon or bell pepper. Then it is slowly fried for 30 minutes to an hour. The food is then garnished with tomatoes or nuts. It is often served with white rice or naan. == History == Although the dish was invented by the Mughal court, its cuisine is probably inspired or developed from a pre- existing cooking technique. This is because a similar method of preparation for mansollas was described in the 12th century AD. == Variants: Kebabs == Although pasanda is usually served as a meat dish, it can also be prepared in the form of kebabs. Pasanda also refers to a light soup made with cream, coconut milk or yogurt and nuts, for its flavor and connection with nuts. == References == Category:Indian food",
