 "text": "Grid computing is a form of distributed computing whereby a \"virtual supercomputer\" is made up of a group of networked, loosely coupled computers, working together to perform very large tasks. It is different from cluster computing, where the computers are similar and work together on a large task. The computers involved in grid computing can be quite different from one another. They work on separate pieces of the larger problem. Category:Computing",
