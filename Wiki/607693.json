He known for the murder campaign that reached a peak in the early 1990s when the assassinations of Antimafia Commission prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino occurred. Riina advocated the killing of women and children, and killed blameless members of the public solely to distract law enforcing agencies. Assassin Giovanni Brusca estimated he murdered 100-200 people on behalf of Riina. After 23 years living as a fugitive he was captured. Riina died on 17 November 2017 at the hospital in Parma of sepsis caused by surgery at the age of 87. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Italian mobsters Category:Murderers",
