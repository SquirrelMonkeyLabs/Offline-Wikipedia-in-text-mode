 "text": "White-collar crime refers to crimes done by people who work in offices. Those people often wear shirts with white collars. This is a sign of high status. Persons who work with their hands are sometimes called \"blue collar\" workers. Most white-collar crimes are done by persons in banking, business or government. The can include bribery, embezzlement, fraud or money laundering. The crimes are done along with their regular work. The term was created by Edwin Sutherland in 1939. A related term, \"fur-collar crime\" refers to crimes committed by high-ranking officials, nobles and people of high status during the 15th century in Western Europe. Noble warriors, especially young bachelor knights who were not assigned any tasks, often did it. They robbed, plundered, and pillaged because they were bored and out of money. Crimes committed against a helpless peasantry by members of the nobility often went unpunished. https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article-abstract/8/4/1/1053963?redirectedFrom=PDF ==References== Category:Financial crimes",
