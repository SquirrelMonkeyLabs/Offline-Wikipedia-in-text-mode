 "text": "Mr. Men is a series of 52 children's books by Roger Hargreaves started in 1971. Little Miss was another series of 39 books by the same author with female characters that started in 1981. After Hargreaves died in 1988, his son, Adam Hargreaves, began writing and illustrating new stories about the Mr. Men and Little Miss characters.
