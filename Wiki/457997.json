They sung barbershop music as children, got success as teen- music idols, produced a hit television show. They have continued as solo and group performers. The Osmonds are Mormons: devout members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their religious values have influenced their careers.Biography: The Osmonds, pure and simple (documentary) The Osmonds children are (from the oldest to the youngest), Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie, and Jimmy Osmond. Virl and Tom (who are twins born in 1945) were born nearly completely deaf. The two took up tap- dancing to perform in the group to make up for the fact that they could not sing. Tom eventually did perform as a full-time member of the Osmonds, however, Virl did not and Virl is the only non-performing Osmond child. Donny and Marie Osmond once hosted a show in the 1970s called Donny and Marie. Donny is a former judge on dancing with the stars. Wayne Osmond was a Cancer activist. Wayne suffered from a Brain tumour during the 1990s and 2000s. == References == Category:1958 establishments in the United States Category:1950s American music groups Category:1960s American music groups Category:1970s American music groups Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American boy bands Category:Musical groups from Utah Category:People from Provo, Utah Category:Musical groups established in 1958 Category:20th-century establishments in Utah",
