 "text": "The phrase nigger in the woodpile is a figure of speech from the United States and it means something suspicious and wrong. The phrase was commonly used from the late 1800's to early 1900's but stopped being used due to people disliking the word nigger and seeing a negative connotation to the word in the late 1900's to the present day. The phrase has been replaced by the phrase elephant in the room in many books due to political correctness. == References == Category:Secrecy",
