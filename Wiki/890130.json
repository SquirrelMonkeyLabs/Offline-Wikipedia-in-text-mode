 "text": "Jose W. Diokno Boulevard, or J.W. Diokno Boulevard which stands for Jose Wright Diokno Boulevard, is a long road that runs north–south along the eastern perimeter of the SM Mall of Asia complex and parallel to Macapagal Boulevard in Bay City, Metro Manila, Philippines. ==Access== It provides access from the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex (CCP Complex) and Roxas Boulevard north to the shopping and lifestyle hub by the Manila Bay in Pasay. Motorists tend to use the highway as the less congested alternative route from Manila to the Bay City vis-à-vis its parallel partner road in Macapagal Boulevard. It also connects to Entertainment City further south in Parañaque, and unlike Macapagal Boulevard is situated along the coastline overlooking the Manila Bay. ==Renaming== The 8-lane median-divided boulevard was formerly known as Bay Boulevard. It was renamed in 2007, including the short extension of Gil Puyat Avenue in CCP Complex which connects it to Roxas Boulevard, after the founding chair of the Commission on Human Rights, Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) founder, and former Filipino senator, José Wright Diokno. The road was constructed by the Philippine Reclamation Authority and was completed in 2011. ==Route== ===Beginning=== Jose Diokno Boulevard starts at the intersection with Roxas Boulevard by the World Trade Center Metro Manila as a direct continuation of Gil Puyat Avenue from Pasay and Makati. It travels westward for between the CCP Complex to the north and World Trade Center Manila to the south, crossing the northern end of Macapagal Boulevard before curving south past the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Complex. ===Bridges=== The Libertad Bridge carries the boulevard across the Libertad Channel. It connects the CCP and GSIS complexes with the SM Central Business Park. This is where it becomes a north–south road running for across the SM Mall of Asia complex. This section of the boulevard is dominated by a roundabout with a large globe in the middle. It serves as the terminus to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. ===Cities=== After crossing the Redemptorist Channel, the boulevard enters Parañaque and the Aseana City and Entertainment City. It runs for from Redemptorist to Asia World City, intersecting with Asean Avenue, where the boulevard then becomes part of the NAIA Expressway (NAIAX) At-Grade section. It then finally arrives at its southern terminus at New Seaside Road, where NAIAX At-Grade continues, by the Okada Manila development. ==Landmarks== * Boomland (defunct amusement park) * CCP Open Field * CITEM (Center for International Trade Expositions and Missions) * Government Service Insurance System Center ** Senate of the Philippines ==Notes== ==References== Category:Streets in Metro Manila",
