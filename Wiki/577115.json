The origin of the claims come from Edward III's territorial claims of France which he claimed gave him the right to be king. He tried to take the throne of France and started the Hundred Years' War. == Claims to the throne of France (1340-1360), (1369-1420) == Name of Monarch Birth of Monarch Death of Monarch Reign of Monarch Edward III (first reign) 13th November 1312 21st June 1377 24th January 1340 - 8th May 1360 Edward III (second reign) 13th November 1312 21st June 1377 Sometime 1369 - 21st June 1377 Richard II 6th January 1367 14th February 1400 21st/22nd June 1377 - 30th September 1399 Henry IV 15th April 1367 20th March 1413 30th September 1399 - 20th March 1413 Henry V 9th August 1386 31st August 1422 20th March 1413 - 21st May 1420 == Heir of France (1420-1422) == Name of Monarch Birth of Monarch Death of Monarch Reign of Monarch Henry V 9th August 1386 31st August 1422 21st May 1420 - 3st August 1422 Henry VI 6th December 1421 21st May 1471 31st August 1422 - 21st October 1422 == King of France (1422-1461), (1470-1471) == The first English monarch to completely rule France for majority of his reign. Henry VI was made to be successor of French king Charles VI and on October 21st 1422 took up the position of the French king. He was said to rule the whole of France but in reality only ruled small parts of the north.
