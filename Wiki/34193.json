 "text": "The vaquita (Phocoena sinus) is a rare type of porpoise. It lives only in the Gulf of California. It is the world's smallest cetacean and most endangered marine mammal. The Vaquita is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union of Conservation of Nature. Forty years ago, the Vaquita population was estimated to have 1000 living individuals. Current research has shown that from 1990 to now (2021), the population has dropped from close to 500 individuals down to 20 or less. The species is most under threat from illegal fishing activities that are taking place in the Gulf; ongoing bycatch in gillnets used to catch shrimp and to poach the endangered totoaba (Totoaba macdonaldi). This species requires a 9-month maternal care period for newborns after birth. Without their mothers, newborns will not be able to survive. Therefore, the loss of a female mother vaquita results in an additional loss of their newborn. == Look == Vaquita have a dark coloring around the eyes and mouth. The upper side of the body is medium to dark gray. The underside is off-white to light gray. It has a rather large fin on its back for its size. The Vaquita is the smallest type of porpoise in the world, growing up to 5 feet long and weighing up to 120 pounds. == Feeding == Vaquita feed on small, bottom-dwelling fish and squid. == Life == They live alone or in small groups, usually of about three, but sometimes they live in groups of up to ten. ==References== Rodríguez-Félix.
