 "text": "Anarcho-syndicalism is a form of anarchism. It sees labour unions as something which will cause revolutionary change. This change will give freedom and equality to the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists want to get rid of the wage system and capitalism. They believe this leads to class divisions and inequality. The basic concepts of anarcho-syndicalism are: # Workersâ€™ solidarity # Direct action # Workers' self-management Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action can bring about change. Anarcho-syndicalists do not take part in indirect action, like electing a representative to a government position. Anarcho-syndicalism played an important role in the Spanish Civil War. == Other websites == * Libertarian Communist Library - Contains Many Anarcho-Syndicalist Texts Category:Anarchism",
