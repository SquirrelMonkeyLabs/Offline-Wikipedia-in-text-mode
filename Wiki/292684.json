 "text": "Over the Limit (2011) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by WWE. It took place on May 22, 2011 at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington. It was the second Over the Limit event held by WWE. == Background == ===Raw matches=== The main event for the Raw side of the PPV was decided on the May 9 edition of Raw. The Miz, Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio faced off in a triple threat match where the winner would face John Cena for the WWE Championship at Over the Limit. The Miz won the match by rolling up Mysterio. After the match was over, as had been announced, Cena came out to announce what type of match he had chosen. He told Miz, if he wants his title back, it's simple, you only \"have to make me say two words\", thus he announced the match would be an \"I Quit\" match. Also on Raw, carrying over from their WrestleMania and Extreme Rules matches, Jerry Lawler challenged Michael Cole to one final match at Over the Limit, where if he lost he would personally induct Cole into the WWE Hall of Fame and give him his Hall of Fame ring. Cole initially said no and started bragging about his Mother's Day with his mother the day before in front of Lawler, whose mother died in February. This prompted King to try and attack Cole who was in his \"Cole Mine\" (a Plexiglas box meant to protect Cole from Lawler). As King went to attack him, he was attacked from behind by Cole's mentor Jack Swagger. A little later in the show, Lawler came back out and attacked Cole through the holes cut in the \"Cole Mine\" by yanking Cole's head repeatedly against the plexiglas by his tie. After he was saved, Swagger accepted the match against Lawler on behalf of Cole, much to Cole's displeasure. ==Results== ==Related pages== *WWE Over the Limit ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Over the Limit website Category:2011 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in Seattle Category:WWE Over the Limit Category:2011 in the United States Category:2010s in Washington (state) Category:21st century in Seattle",
