Felix Mourinho practiced this sport as a professional goalkeeper. He also represented his country in one international match. Without a doubt, this factor had a huge impact on the Portuguese coach's career since his childhood, especially with his father's unquenchable desire for Jose to become a big player. Mourinho won four league titles in a row (two at Porto and two at Chelsea). He has also won the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup with Porto. For two years in a row (2004 and 2005), Mourinho was named the world's best football coach by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS). After leaving Chelsea F.C., he was replaced by Avram Grant. He went to coach Internazionale Milano and won the Serie A, Italian Super Cup and Champions League in a single season (2009–10). ==Managerial statistics== Managerial record by team and tenure Team From To Record Record Record Record Record Record Record Record Team From To Benfica 20 September 2000 5 December 2000 União de Leiria 1 July 2001 23 January 2002 Porto 23 January 2002 2 June 2004 Chelsea 2 June 2004 20 September 2007 Inter Milan 2 June 2008 28 May 2010 Real Madrid 31 May 2010 1 June 2013 Chelsea 3 June 2013 17 December 2015 Manchester United 27 May 2016 18 December 2018 Tottenham Hotspur 20 November 2019 19 April 2021 Roma 1 July 2021 16 January 2024 Fenerbahçe 2 June 2024 present Total Total Total ==Honours== ===Assistant Manager=== Porto * Primeira Divisão: 1994–95, 1995–96 * Taça de Portugal: 1993–94 * Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 1994 Barcelona *La Liga: 1997–98, 1998–99 *Copa del Rey: 1996–97, 1997–98 *Supercopa de España: 1996 *European Cup Winners' Cup: 1996–97 *UEFA Super Cup: 1997 ===Manager=== Porto * Primeira Liga: 2002–03, 2003–04 * Taça de Portugal: 2002–03 * Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 2003 * UEFA Champions League: 2003–04 * UEFA Cup: 2002–03 Chelsea * Premier League: 2004–05, 2005–06, 2014–15 * FA Cup: 2006–07 * Football League Cup: 2004–05, 2006–07, 2014–15 * FA Community Shield: 2005 Inter Milan * Serie A: 2008–09, 2009–10 * Coppa Italia: 2009–10 * Supercoppa Italiana: 2008 * UEFA Champions League: 2009–10 Real Madrid * La Liga: 2011–12 * Copa del Rey: 2010–11 * Supercopa de España: 2012 Manchester United * EFL Cup: 2016–17 * FA Community Shield: 2016 * UEFA Europa League: 2016–17 Roma * UEFA Europa Conference League: 2021–22 Individual * Onze d'Or Coach of the Year: 2005 * FIFA World Coach of the Year: 2010 *IFFHS World's Best Club Coach: 2004, 2005, 2010, 2012 *IFFHS World's Best Coach of the 21st Century 2001–2020 *Premier League Manager of the Season: 2004–05, 2005–06, 2014–15 *Premier League Manager of the Month: November 2004, January 2005, March 2007, November 2020 *Serie A Coach of the Year: 2008–09, 2009–10 *Serie A Coach of the Month: August 2022 *Panchina d'Oro: 2009–10 *Miguel Muñoz Trophy: 2010–11, 2011–12 *UEFA Manager of the Year: 2002–03, 2003–04 *UEFA Team of the Year: 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010 *World Soccer Magazine World Manager of the Year: 2004, 2005, 2010 *World Soccer 3rd Greatest Manager of All Time: 2013 * ESPN 9th Greatest Manager of All time: 2013 * France Football 13th Greatest Manager of All time: 2019 *BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award: 2005 *La Gazzetta dello Sport Man of the Year: 2010 *International Sports Press Association Best Manager in the World: 2010 *Prémio Prestígio Fernando Soromenho: 2012 *Football Extravaganza's League of Legends (2011) *Globe Soccer Awards Best Coach of the Year: 2012 *Globe Soccer Awards Best Media Attraction in Football: 2012 *Portuguese Coach of the Century: 2015 *PFA Portuguese Manager of the Year: 2017 *LMA Performances of the Week: 2 December 2017 (Arsenal 1–3 Man.Utd), 7 April 2018 (Man.City 2–3 Man.Utd) *Italian Football Hall of Fame: 2022 ===Others=== *Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry *Doctor Honoris causa – for his accomplishments in football from Lisbon Technical University ===Records=== Guinness World Records *Former record holder for most points achieved in a Premier League season (95 points) *Youngest manager to reach 100 Champions League games (49 years 12 days) *Most games unbeaten at home in the Premier League (77) *Fewest goals conceded in a Premier League season (15 goals) *Longest football unbeaten home run by a manager (9 years) Others *Most Champions League titles with different clubs (two) ==Notes== ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Portuguese Roman Catholics Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Portuguese football managers Category:Manchester United F.C. managers Category:Association football coaches",
