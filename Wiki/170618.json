 "text": "Miles Gilbert \"Tim\" Horton (January 12, 1930 – February 21, 1974) was a Canadian professional hockey defenceman from Cochrane, Ontario. He played 24 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the New York Rangers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, and Buffalo Sabres. He was also a businessman and the co-founder of Tim Hortons, now Canada's largest restaurant chain. He died in an car crash at St. Catharines, Ontario in 1974 at the age of 44. == Doughnut shops == In 1964, Horton opened his first Tim Hortons shop in Hamilton, Ontario. As well as over 2700 shops in Canada, Buffalo, New York has over 80 Tim Hortons Doughnut Shops, and they can be found in Detroit, Michigan; Columbus, Ohio; and other American cities, mainly in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region. There are now over 400 shops in the United States. == Death == Early on the morning of February 21, 1974, Horton was driving on the Queen Elizabeth Way from Toronto to his home in Buffalo after the Buffalo Sabres had played in Toronto the night before, in his sports car. He lost control and hit a concrete culvert. The crash turned the vehicle over and Horton, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown out of the car. Horton was dead on arrival at the local hospital. A police officer following Horton said that he had been going over 160 km/h (100 mph). Tim Horton is buried in York Cemetery Toronto.. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1947-48 St. Michael's Majors OHA 32 6 7 13 137 -- -- -- -- -- 1948-49 St. Michael's Majors OHA 32 9 18 27 95 -- -- -- -- -- 1949-50 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1949-50 Pittsburgh Hornets AHL 60 5 18 23 83 -- -- -- -- -- 1950-51 Pittsburgh Hornets AHL 68 8 26 34 129 13 0 9 9 16 1951-52 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 4 0 0 0 8 -- -- -- -- -- 1951-52 Pittsburgh Hornets AHL 64 12 19 31 146 11 1 3 4 16 1952-53 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 2 14 16 85 -- -- -- -- -- 1953-54 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 7 24 31 94 5 1 1 2 4 1954-55 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 67 5 9 14 84 -- -- -- -- -- 1955-56 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 35 0 5 5 36 2 0 0 0 4 1956-57 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 66 6 19 25 72 -- -- -- -- -- 1957-58 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 53 6 20 26 39 -- -- -- -- -- 1958-59 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 5 21 26 76 12 0 3 3 16 1959-60 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 3 29 32 69 10 0 1 1 6 1960-61 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 57 6 15 21 75 5 0 0 0 0 1961-62 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 10 28 38 88 12 3 13 16 16 1962-63 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 6 19 25 69 10 1 3 4 10 1963-64 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 9 20 29 71 14 0 4 4 20 1964-65 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 12 16 28 95 6 0 2 2 13 1965-66 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 6 22 28 76 4 1 0 1 12 1966-67 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 70 8 17 25 70 12 3 5 8 25 1967-68 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 69 4 23 27 82 -- -- -- -- -- 1968-69 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 74 11 29 40 107 4 0 0 0 7 1969-70 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 59 3 19 22 91 1969-70 New York Rangers NHL 15 1 5 6 16 6 1 1 2 28 1970-71 New York Rangers NHL 78 2 18 20 57 13 1 4 5 14 1971-72 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 44 2 9 11 40 4 0 1 1 2 1972-73 Buffalo Sabres NHL 69 1 16 17 56 6 0 1 1 4 1973-74 Buffalo Sabres NHL 55 0 6 6 53 -- -- -- -- -- NHL totals 1446 115 403 518 1611 126 11 39 50 183 ==Awards and achievements== * 1961-62 – Stanley Cup * 1962-63 – Stanley Cup Champion * 1963-64 – Stanley Cup Champion * 1966-67 – Stanley Cup Champion * 1977 – Inducted (posthumously) into the Hockey Hall of Fame * 1996 – Number 2 retired by the Buffalo Sabres * 1998 – Ranked number 43 The Hockey News list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. * 2004 – Ranked number 59 The Greatest Canadian by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation *2016 – Number 7 retired by the Toronto Maple Leafs ==References== == Other websites == * * The Canadian Encyclopedia: Tim Horton * Biography at Tim Hortons corporate site Category:1930 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in Canada Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:New York Rangers players Category:Pittsburgh Hornets players Category:Pittsburgh Penguins players Category:Road accident deaths Category:Sportspeople from Ontario Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Ontario Hockey League players",
