 "text": "The Chetniks were a resistance movement during World War II. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, resistance movements formed to fight the occupying Axis powers. One of them were the Chetniks led by Draža Mihailović (a general in the royal Yugoslav army). They faced opposition from the Communist Yugoslav Partisans, even though they fought together in the first few battles, the Chetniks started collaborating with the Axis in late 1941. In 1944–45, the Germans and the Chetniks were losing the war. The Partisans won the war in May 1945 and Mihailović was executed the next year. == Notes and References == Category:Rebel militia groups Category:World War II Category:Nationalist organizations in Europe Category:Yugoslavia",
