 "text": "The brachial plexus is a group of nerves. It runs from the vertebral column to the arm. ==Structure== The brachial plexus is divided into five roots, three trunks, six divisions, three cords, and five branches. ===Roots=== The five roots come out of the spinal cord. They are each named after the part of the spinal cord they come out of: C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1. ===Trunks=== These roots join to form three trunks: * \"upper\" (C5-C6) * \"middle\" (C7) * \"lower\" (C8-T1) ===Divisions=== Each trunk then splits into two divisions: * anterior (front) divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks * posterior (back) divisions of the upper, middle, and lower trunks ===Cords=== These six divisions join up again to become the three cords. * The posterior cord is formed from the three posterior divisions of the trunks (C5-C8,T1) * The lateral cord is formed from the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks (C5-C7) * The medial cord is simply a continuation of the anterior division of the lower trunk (C8,T1) ===Diagram=== ===Nerves=== The nerves that come out of the brachial plexus include: * Radial nerve * Axillary nerve * Musculocutaneous nerve * Median nerve * Ulnar nerve == Related pages == *Brachial artery Category:Nervous system",
