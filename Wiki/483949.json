 "text": "The smooth snake (Coronella austriaca).Street D. 1979. The reptiles of northern and central Europe. London: B.T. Batsford. 268 pp. . is found in Britain, where it lives only in southern heathlands. It is a non-venomous colubrid species found in northern and central Europe, and as far east as northern Iran. In contrast to many other snakes, their scales are flat (not keeled). This gives the snake a smooth texture to the touch, from which it gets its common name. The smooth snake feeds on smaller animals, especially other reptiles. It subdues larger prey by constriction, although unlike true constrictors it does not actually kill by this method. It reproduces by laying eggs, which are buried in sand in a warm place. Scientific Name: Coronella austriaca Described by: Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768 Subspecies: Two are recognizedâ€”C. a. austriaca (widespread) and C. a. acutirostris (restricted to Portugal). == References == Category:Colubrids Category:Snakes of Asia Category:Reptiles of Europe",
