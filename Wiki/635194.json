 "text": "Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq (1309 â€“ 20 September 1388) was a Muslim ruler of the Tughluq Dynasty, who reigned over the Delhi Sultanate from 1351 to 1388.Tughlaq Shahi Kings of Delhi: Chart The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 2, p. 369.. His father's name was Rajab (the younger brother of Ghazi Malik) who had the title: Sipahsalar. He succeeded his cousin Muhammad bin Tughlaq following the latter's death in 1351 at Thatta in Sindh, where Muhammad bin Tughlaq had gone in pursuit of Taghi the Muslim ruler of Gujarat. For the first time in the history of Delhi Sultanate, a situation was confronted wherein nobody was ready to accept the reins of power. With much difficulty, the camp followers convinced Firuz to accept the responsibility. In fact, Khawaja Jahan, the Wazir of Muhammad bin Tughlaq had placed a small boy on throne claiming him to be the son of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, who meekly surrendered afterwards. Firuz Shah Tughlaq thereafter reigned upon the throne of Delhi and took control of the Delhi Sultanate. Due to widespread unrest, his realm was much smaller than Muhammad's. Tughlaq was forced by rebellions to concede virtual independence to Bengal and other provinces. However, he reconquered Bengal in 1364. Firuz Shah Tughlaq was a religious Sunni Muslim who established Sharia across his entire sultanate. In Delhi, Firuz Shah Tughlaq constructed a jamia masjid called Jamia-i-Miri (mosque of miri) and asked all the Muslim scholars (ulama) and mystics to assemble there for the Friday prayers. == References == Category:Tughlaq dynasty Category:1300s births Category:1380s deaths Category:Indian Muslims Category:14th century in India",
