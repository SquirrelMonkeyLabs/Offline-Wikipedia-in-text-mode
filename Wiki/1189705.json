 "text": "The rules and regulations of cricket are encoded in a specification called The Laws of Cricket. The Laws are known to have existed since 1744, though never actually printed until 1755. The code underwent a significant revision in 1774. Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in 1787 and issued a revised version of the Laws on 30 May 1788. The club has owned copyright ever since. Although MCC still has responsibility for drafting and publishing revisions, it does so in consultation with the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 member countries. Following the 2017 revision, there are now 42 Laws headed by a preamble on the Spirit of Cricket. ==References== Laws",
