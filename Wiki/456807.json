 "text": "Six Flags New Orleans, also shortened to SFNO, is an abandoned theme park in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The park opened on May 20, 2000 and was first known as Jazzland. The name was changed to Six Flags New Orleans on April 12, 2003 after Six Flags got the lease in March 2002. The park has been closed since just before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in August 2005. It is currently owned by the City of New Orleans. After seeing the damage that was caused by Katrina, Six Flags tried to end their 75-year lease with the city in July 2006. They succeeded in September 2009. The abandoned park is a popular urban exploration spot. There have been many different plans announced to redevelop the site such as reviving and expanding the park, creating a Nickelodeon-branded theme/water park, reviving the park as Jazzland, and an upscale outlet mall but it still an abandoned amusement park. In 2023, plans were approved by the city for Bayou Phoenix to begin redeveloping the land. ==Gallery== Image:Six Flags NOLA CL SED FOR STORM.JPG|A sign saying that they are closed for Hurricane Katrina in 2010 Image:Aerial view of SFNO after Hurricane Katrina edit.jpg|An aerial view of the park flooded with water two weeks after Hurricane Katrina Image:Six Flags New Orleans - Jester.jpg|Ruins of The Jester roller coaster in 2009 Image:Six Flags NOLA CrashBob NoSlack The Ride.jpg|Ruins of SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride in 2011 Image:Six Flags NOLA Jumping the Gator.jpg|A trespasser skateboarding around the park in 2011 ==References== Category:Six Flags amusement parks Category:New Orleans Category:Theme parks in the United States Category:Hurricane Katrina Category:2000 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Louisiana",
