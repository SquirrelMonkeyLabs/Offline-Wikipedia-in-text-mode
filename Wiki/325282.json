He founded the Eastman Kodak Company and invented roll film. This made photography popular and led to other men inventing film stock. His Kodak company still runs today, but more focused on printers and printing. Eastman shot himself dead in Rochester, New York. == References == Category:American inventors Category:Businesspeople from New York (state) Category:Suicides by firearm in the United States Category:1854 births Category:1932 deaths",
