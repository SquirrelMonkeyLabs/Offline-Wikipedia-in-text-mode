 "text": "The rough leaf frog (Hylomantis aspera) is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Guyana, Brazil, Venezuela, French Guiana, and Ecuador, and it is most common in Suriname. People have seen it as high as 600 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in forests, near the edges of forests, and in swamps. People have seen it sitting on leaves and on water plants. The tadpoles swim in puddles that dry up later. Scientists do not think this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
