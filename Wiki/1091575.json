 "text": "Börek or burek is a kind of pastries or pies found in the Balkans, Middle East and Central Asia. The pastry is made of a thin flaky dough such as filo with a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, spinach, or potatoes. Boreks are mainly associated with the Middle East, Caucasus, and also with the former Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans and the South Caucasus, Eastern European and Central European countries, Northern Africa and Central Asia. A borek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. They are usually baked but some are fried. Borek is sometimes sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds. It can be served hot or cold. It is a custom of Sephardic Jews to have bourekas for their Shabbat breakfast meal on Saturday mornings. It is commonly served with ayran in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and North Macedonia. ==References== Category:Albanian food Category:Algerian food Category:Armenian food Category:Austrian food Category:Belarusian food Category:Bulgarian food Category:Croatian food Category:Cypriot food Category:Czech food Category:Egyptian food Category:Estonian food Category:German food Category:Hungarian food Category:Iraqi food Category:Israeli food Category:Jewish food Category:Jordanian food Category:Kosovan food Category:Lebanese food Category:Libyan food Category:Macedonian food Category:Maltese food Category:Montenegrin food Category:Moroccan food Category:Palestinian food Category:Polish food Category:Romanian food Category:Russian food Category:Saudi Arabian food Category:Serbian food Category:Slovak food Category:Slovenian food Category:Syrian food Category:Tunisian food Category:Turkish food Category:Ukrainian food Category:Pies",
