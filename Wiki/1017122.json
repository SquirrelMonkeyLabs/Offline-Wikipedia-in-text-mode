 "text": "Sinamia is an extinct genus of freshwater amiiform fish which existed in China, Japan, and possibly South Korea during the Early Cretaceous period. == Description == === Sinamia liaoningensis === Sinamia liaoningensis is a very large fish and has a much more podgy body form than the other species of the genus but still resembles the bowfin. === Sinamia kukurihime === Sinamia kukurihime is very similar to the modern-day bowfin. A pyriform-shaped gular has been described for two isolated ossifications of Sinamia kukurihime, whose outline resembles that of K. phattharajani, except for the smooth posterior margin of the first. == Taxonomy == * Sinamia zdanskyi Stensi√∂, 1935 Meng-Yin Formation, Shangdong, China, Early Cretaceous * Sinamia huananensis Su, 1973 Yangtang Formation, Anhui, China, Early Cretaceous * Sinamia chinhuaensis Wei, 1976 Guantou Formation, Zhejiang, China, Early Cretaceous * Sinamia luozigouensis Li, 1984 Luozigou Formation, Jilin, China, Early Cretaceous * Sinamia poyangica Su and Li, 1990 Shixi Formation, Jiangxi, China, Early Cretaceous * Sinamia liaoningensis Zhang, 2012 Yixian Formation, Jiufotang Formation, Liaoning, China, Early Cretaceous (Aptian) * Sinamia kukurihime Yabumoto, 2014 Kuwajima Formation, Ishikawa, Japan, Early Cretaceous (Barremian) * Sinamia lanzhoensis Peng, Murray, Brinkman, Zhang and You, 2015 Hekou Group, Gansu, China, Early Cretaceous == References == # Deesri, U.; Naksri, W.; Jintasakul, P.; Noda, Y.; Yukawa, H.; Hossny, T.E.; Cavin, L.
