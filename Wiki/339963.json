 "text": "American Bandstand is an American music and amateur dance show. It was televised in various versions from 1952 to 1989. It was hosted from 1956 until its final season by Dick Clark. He was also its producer. The show \"starred\" teenagers off the street dancing to Top 40 hits introduced by Clark. At least one popular musical act would usually appear in person to lip sync one of their latest hits. Dick Clark became an American media mogul as a result of the show. It also inspired similar music programs, such as Soul Train and Top of the Pops. ==Other websites== Category:American television series Category:First run syndicated television programs Category:English-language television programs",
