Fryshuset leads activities for young people in four areas: School, Youth Culture, Work & Business starting, and Example & Faith in the Future. Fryshuset helps all young people. It focuses mostly on those who live by themselves. == History == Fryshuset started in the fall of 1984 in a worn-out freezer warehouse in Norra Hammarbyhamnen in Stockholm. The passionate Anders Carlberg was tasked by YMCA Söder to find a room that could function as a basketball hall and gather all the children and young people in Söder who wanted to play basketball. The old freezer warehouse was empty and they began to renovate and build a sports hall. == Other websites == * https://fryshuset.se/verksamhet/tillsammans-for-sverige/in-english/ Category:1984 establishments in Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Stockholm",
