 "text": "A public bookcase (also called a book exchange, a free library or a street library) is a box or cupboard with books in it that everyone can get to. People often put a book they have finished reading into the bookcase, and then take a book out of the bookcase to read instead. People can also take books from the bookcase without giving a book if they have no books to give. Public bookcases are often along sidewalks, in public buildings or in people's gardens near the sidewalk. ==Gallery== File:Boekenkastje Meddo.jpg File:Norderney, Bücherschrank am Onnen-Visser-Platz -- 2016 -- 5436-42.jpg File:Boîte à livres, chemin des Grandes Terres (Neyron).jpg File:Public Bookcase (164 Dovercourt Rd).jpg Category:Libraries Category:Street furniture",
