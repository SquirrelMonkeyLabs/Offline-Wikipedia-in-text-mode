It straddles in the coast area of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states with over 96% of it in Andhra Pradesh and 3% in Tamil Nadu situated on the Coromandel Coast in South India. The lake encompasses the Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary. The barrier island of Sriharikota separates the lake from the Bay of Bengal and is home to the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The fishing village of Pulicat is at the south end of the lake, from which the lake got its name. The Satish Dhawan Space Center is located on the north end of the island. ==References== Category:Andhra Pradesh Category:Lakes of India",
