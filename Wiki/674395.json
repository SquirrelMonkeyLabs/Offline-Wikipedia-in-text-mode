 "text": "A goaltender mask, commonly referred to as a goalie mask or a hockey mask, is a mask by ice hockey. NHL goalies wear protective helmets, consisting of a hard back and main body, a front cage, and a plastic neck guard. These masks are decorated with unique, one of a kind graphics designed by a third party artist that in some way feature the teams logos and colors. Occasionally, goalies will wear themed masks; sometimes goalies will wear purple for their team's HFC night, or Camouflage for the team's Military Appreciation Night.
