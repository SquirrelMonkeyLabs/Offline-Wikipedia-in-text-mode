Homer does not believe what she thinks. On the next day, she tries getting the family to talk about romance. They can only remember times their many relationships did not work out. These are shown as parts from episodes before this one. Homer then tells the family how he and Marge met. Their children do not want to listen and watch television while Homer and Marge kiss. == Production == This is the second clip show episode of The Simpsons. The first clip show episode is \"So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show\" from the 4th season. \"Another Simpsons Clip Show\" was written by Jon Vitti. He went with the name \"Penny Wise\" in the closing credits because he did not want to be known for writing the clip show. The episode was directed by David Silverman. The episodes that were shown in the clip show were made by John Swartzwelder, Frank Mula, David Richardson, Jeff Martin, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Matt Groening, Sam Simon, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen, Wallace Wolodarsky, Nell Scovell, David M. Stern, George Meyer, Conan O'Brien, Robert Cohen, Bill Canterbury, and Dan McGrath. The Fox network wanted the producers of The Simpsons to make clip shows. This was because they needed less money to make than a normal episode. Producers thought four episodes in each season should be clip shows. This was so that they would not be stressed out on making a season with more episodes than normal. However, this was not done because they thought fans would not like the clip shows. The Fox network thought this could happen at first because it would cost less to make a clip show but they would still get just as much money as a regular episode in syndication.

TV Squad thought that it was made in a way that was still \"worth watching\" and was similar to a slideshow, but \"not quite as boring\". Other critics said it was \"not the worst\" clip show and that \"the episode title pretty much says it all\". Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide thought that the episodes shown were good but that the clip show was not necessary. Lisa talks about how romance was taken in a \"hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney\" and parts of it were later sold. This was used in studies on how organizations are shown in pop culture. The episode was talked about in Arab Strap's song \"The First Big Weekend\". One of the lyrics is \"It was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer.\" == References == === Books === * == Other websites == * * Category:The Simpsons (season 6) episodes Category:1994 television episodes",
