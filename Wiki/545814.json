The toppings often include flavored sauces, whipped cream, nuts, and most notably a cherry on top of the dessert. One banana split has 893 calories. ==History== There are a few different stories about the first banana split. People in Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Wilmington, Ohio say that the first banana split was made in their city. However, most people say that David \"Doc\" Strickler made the first banana split in the city of Latrobe, Pennsylvania in 1904. He sold the first banana splits for ten cents. Many students at St. Vincent College, a school in Latrobe, liked the banana splits and told their friends in other cities about them. After a few years, the banana split was popular in many cities in the United States. Steele, Bruce (August 25, 2004). \"With a Cherry on Top-Pitt fetes alums creation of banana split\".
