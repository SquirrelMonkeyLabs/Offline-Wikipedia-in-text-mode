Weather in the Rocky Mountains can be harsh and change quickly. In the summer, there are often afternoon thunderstorms. It can snow all year, even in July or August, but Mount Elbert does not have snowpack all year. The low areas of Mount Elbert are forested and have many kinds of trees, such as pine, spruce, aspen, and fir. Because Mount Elbert is very tall, the top of the mountain is an alpine environment. Alpine environments are cold and windy, and trees cannot grow in them. Some of the animals that live on Mount Elbert are black bears, marmots, mule deer, pikas, and pocket gophers. There are also many species of birds. Elk, grouse, turkey, and bighorn sheep also live on Mount Elbert in the summer. ==Geology== Mount Elbert is part of the Sawatch Range in the Rocky Mountains. Mount Elbert is mostly made of quartzite, which is a metamorphic rock. Mount Elbert also has intrusions of igneous rock, such as pegmatite, gneiss and schist. ==Climbing== Climbing Mount Elbert does not need special rock climbing or mountaineering equipment. Fit persons can hike (walk) to the top of the mountain. Because of this, Mount Elbert is often called the \"gentle giant\" of the Rocky Mountains. But climbing Mount Elbert can be dangerous, because it is very tall. People can get altitude sickness. In winter, there is danger of avalanches. == References == Category:Mountains of Colorado",
