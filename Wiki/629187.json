 "text": "Polybutadiene is a polymer, that is mainly used as synthetic rubber: It is made from the monomer 1,3-Butadiene. Polybutadiene has a high resistance to wear. About 70% of the production is used for tires. About 25% is used as an additive to improve the toughness (impact resistance) of plastics such as polystyrene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Polybutadiene rubber accounted for about a quarter of total global consumption of synthetic rubbers in 2012. It is also used to manufacture golf balls, various elastic objects and to coat or encapsulate electronic assemblies, offering high electrical resistivity.Heinz-Dieter Brandt, Wolfgang Nentwig, Nicola Rooney, Ronald T.
