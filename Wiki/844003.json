 "text": "In the 2008-09 Premier League, the winners Manchester United, went 22 hours of football without giving up a league goal. They demoted Newcastle, Middlesborough and West Brom in descending order. The Premier League's top scorer in the 2008-09 season was Nicolas Anelka. He only scored 19 goals. It was the second lowest amount ever. Liverpool only lost two matches in the Premier League that season. If it wasn't for the Red Devil's total of 90 points, Liverpool might have won. Liverpool had a total of 86 points. It has since been matched by Tottenham and beaten by Manchester City twice. This was the first season that the Abu Dhabi United Group had bought Manchester City and so arrived Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta and Robinho.
