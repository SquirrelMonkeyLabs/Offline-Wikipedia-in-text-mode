 "text": "Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, often simply called The Metrodome, was a domed sports stadium in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. The field was renamed Mall of America Field at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in October 2009. Opened in 1982, it replaced Metropolitan Stadium, which was on the current site of the Mall of America in Bloomington (which, beginning a three year deal on October 5, 2009, now holds naming rights for the Metrodome's field), and Memorial Stadium on the University of Minnesota campus. The Metrodome was home to the National Football League's Minnesota Vikings, and in its last years was also sometimes used by the Big Ten's Minnesota Golden Gophers baseball team. The stadium was also the home of the Minnesota Twins from 1982 to 2009 and the Golden Gophers football team from 1982 to 2008. The Twins now play at the nearby Target Field, while Golden Gophers football returned to campus at TCF Bank Stadium. The Vikings played their last game at the stadium on December 29, 2013. Demolition of the stadium began on January 18, 2014. A new stadium for the Vikings, U.S. Bank Stadium, was built on the site, and opened in 2016. During construction of the new stadium, the Vikings played at TCF Bank Stadium, located on the University of Minnesota campus. ==References== ==Other websites== *Metrodome Dreamscapes - digital ephemera archive *Ballpark Digest review of Metrodome *Blog with pictures of 2011 roof * Category:Sports buildings in Minneapolis Category:Minnesota Twins Category:1982 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Minnesota Category:2014 disestablishments in the United States",
