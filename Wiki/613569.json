 "text": "Automatic sprinklers or irrigators are one method of putting out a fire. They are usually part of a fire system based on a water reservoir for the supply of the system and a network of pipes. They are usually activated by detecting the effects of a fire, such as the increase in temperature associated with fire, or the smoke generated by combustion. Sometimes, sprinkler systems can be activated at the same time as the actual alarm at a pull station. Category:Fire",
