 "text": "emailSanta.com is a Christmas-themed entertainment website. It claims to let people send emails to Santa Claus and get a computer-generated, personalised answer from the website. ==History== === Creation === emailSanta.com was started in 1997 by Alan Kerr. Kerr started the website after a strike by Canada Post workers prevented his niece and nephews from sending letters to Santa Claus, which are replied to by volunteers at Canada Post. During the first two weeks of the site's existence, emailSanta received over 1,000 emails. The website can be read in different languages. The website also has a \"Santa Tracker\", which mimics the tracking of Santa Claus. ==References== Category:Christmas Category:Entertainment websites Category:Canadian websites",
