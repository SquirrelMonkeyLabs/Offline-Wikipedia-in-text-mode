 "text": "Günter Schabowski (4 January 1929 – 1 November 2015) was an East German journalist and politician. He was an official of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), the ruling party during most of the existence of the German Democratic Republic. Schabowski gained worldwide fame in November 1989 when he improvised a slightly mistaken answer to a press conference question, raising popular expectations so rapidly that massive crowds gathered the same night at the Berlin Wall, forcing its opening after 28 years. Schabowski died from complications of a stroke in Berlin, aged 86. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1929 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Disease-related deaths in Berlin Category:German journalists Category:Heads of state of East Germany Category:Members of the Volkskammer Category:Politicians from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Category:Politicians of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany",
