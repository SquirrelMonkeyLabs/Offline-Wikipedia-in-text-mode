 "text": "\"Meitei temples\" or \"Manipuri temples\" (, ) are the structures built to house deities within sanctuaries in Sanamahism, the ancient Meitei religion. They are designed to bring humans and gods together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Sanamahism. ==Remarkable Examples== ===Hiyangthang Lairembi Temple=== The \"Temple of Hiyangthang Lairembi\" is an old temple, dedicated to Goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi, who is a form of Irai Leima, the water goddess in Meitei mythology and religion. In Medieval Manipur, during the reign of Emperor Garib Niwaj Pamheiba, the temple structure was re- modified from its former architecture. Besides, it was also re-affiliated with Hinduism, other than its own Sanamahism (Meitei religion), by the installation of idol of Hindu goddess Durga, besides that of Irai Leima. ===Iputhou Pakhangba Laishang=== Iputhou Pakhangba Laishang, the ancient temple dedicated to Pakhangba, in the heart of Kangla, the old metropolis of Ancient Manipur, is a masterpiece of Meitei architecture.https://www.ixigo.com/pakhangba- temple-moirang-india-ne-1639834 However, due to damages in its structure, the building was rebuilt with a completely different architectural design and was recently consecrated in 2010. ===Sanamahi Temple=== The \"Temple of Sanamahi\", better known as \"Sanamahi Temple\", is one of the most antique temples in Ancient Manipur. It is built with a dedication to Lainingthou Sanamahi. However, its main structures were reconstructed during the reign of Hindu Manipuri King Kulachandra in Medieval Manipur in 1891 AD.http://www.onlytravelguide.com/manipur/spiritual/lord-sanamahi-temple.php ==References== Category:Temples",
