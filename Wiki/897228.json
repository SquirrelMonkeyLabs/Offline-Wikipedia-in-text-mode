 "text": "Atomic semiotics (or nuclear semiotics) is an interdisciplinary field of semiotics which studies potential uses of long-term nuclear waste warning messages. It is concerned with labelling radioactive waste to deter human intrusion at nuclear waste repositories in the far future. ==Elements of the message== The message must contain three elements: * That it is a message * That the substances put in a specific place are dangerous * Information about the kind of danger which comes from these substances The message must also be credible. If it isn't credible it will be understood, but neglected; people will believe that this is done to protect an important treasure. These substances must be safe for 10.000s to millions of years.
