He tried to introduce conscription but the public did not want it. His party, Labor, kicked him out and he formed a new party with the opposition called the Nationalist Party. He was Prime Minister for over 7 years which was the most of anyone at the time. He was forced to resign by the Country Party in 1923 but he stayed in Parliament until he died. Before serving as Prime Minister, Hughes was Minister for External Affairs under Chris Watson. He was Attorney-General in Andrew Fisher's three Labor governments in 1908–09, 1910–13 and 1914–15. ==References== Category:1862 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Prime ministers of Australia Category:Politicians from London Category:Australian Labor Party politicians Category:Liberal Party of Australia politicians Category:Nationalist Party of Australia politicians Category:United Australia Party politicians Category:Australian ministers for Foreign Affairs Category:Attorneys General of Australia Category:Politicians from Sydney",
