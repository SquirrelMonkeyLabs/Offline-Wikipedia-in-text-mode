It was directed by Lê Bình. == Plot == Long ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat. Some said this, and some said that ; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet the case. \"You will all agree\", said he, \"that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her\". \"I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood\". This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said : \"That is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat ?\". The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mouse said : \"It is easy to propose impossible remedies\". == Production == * Style : 2D computer animation * Artist : Lê Bình * Animator : Đào Xuân Thành, Lê Hồng Yến, Dương Văn Hùng, Quách Lê Tuyến, Đào Minh Châu, Nguyễn Hữu Lãm, Nguyễn Vân Anh, Vũ Mạnh Hùng, Nguyễn Phương Nhi, Cao Minh Dũng, Ngô Ngọc Long, Phạm Minh Nguyệt, Lê Thanh Huyền, Lê Bình * Editor : Nguyễn Thị Vân, Nguyễn Quỳnh Hoa, Lê Thu Thủy, Hoàng Thu Hương, Trần Bình Minh, Hoàng Công Đức, Vũ Thị Hoa, Bùi Ái Liên, Nguyễn Thu Hiền, Nguyễn Tuấn Phúc, Đào Bích Hồng * Camera : Trần Thị Dịu, Trịnh Hải Yến * Photography director : Phan Trung, Nguyễn Việt Phương, Nguyễn Thị Thùy, Bùi Hồng Thái * Color : Đào Việt Hà, Nguyễn Khánh Linh, Nguyễn Thị Hoa, Lương Minh Ngọc, Phó Vương Anh, Vũ Thị Dung, Lê Thị Bích * Sound : Đặng Duy Chiến, Lê Bình * Montage : Phạm Thị Trang * Computer : Nguyễn Duy Long, Nguyễn Lê Giang * Theme : Where to return (Nơi về) by Đặng Duy Chiến with Hoài Nam's singing == Award == * Silver Kite prize - Vietnam Film Festival XIX (2015)Vietnam Film Festival XIX : Cartoons == Related pages == * Belling the Cat (fable) == References == Category:2014 animated movies Category:Vietnamese animated movies Category:Movies about cats Category:Movies about mice",
