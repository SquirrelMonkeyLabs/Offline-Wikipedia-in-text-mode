 "text": "Johnathan Porter (born January 20, 1997), known professionally as Blueface Bleedem or simply Blueface, is an American rapper. He is from Los Angeles, California. After releasing his song \"Respect My Cryppin'\" in October 2018, Blueface became a viral internet meme due to his offbeat rapping style and high-pitched voice. He signed with the West Coast branch of Birdman's Cash Money Records label in November 2018. A former college football player, Porter began rapping in January 2018 and assumed the stage name Blueface Bleedem, a reference to his ties at the School Yard Crip gang. His first song \"Dead Locs\" was released on SoundCloud in January 2018, and he released his first full- length project, Famous Cryp in June 2018. The song and EP helped him build a local following in California, and his second EP, Two Coccy was released on SoundCloud and Spotify in September. He is known for his controversial, abusive relationship with Chrisean Rock, who hails from Maryland. ==References== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:African- American rappers Category:American songwriters Category:Rappers from Los Angeles Category:21st-century American rappers Category:Internet memes",
