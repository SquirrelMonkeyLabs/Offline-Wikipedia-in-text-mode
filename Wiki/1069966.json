 "text": "Constance of Normandy (between 1057 and 1061 – 13 August 1090) was a Duchess of Brittany. She was one of the nine children of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. She was born in Normandy, where her father was duke. William of Jumièges, the monk who chronicled the 1066 Norman conquest of England, names Constance second among the daughters of King William and Queen Matilda.
