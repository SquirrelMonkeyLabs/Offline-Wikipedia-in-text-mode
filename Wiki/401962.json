 "text": "Reginald Scot (ca. 1538-1599) was an writer who was born in Kent, England, who studied law and served as a justice of the peace. His first book was Perfect Platform of a Hop-Garden, about growing hops. His second book was The Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584), which took a skeptical look at witches and witchcraft. It also exposed the tricks used by charlatans and magicians to fool people. His purpose in writing the book was to prevent old, ill, and simple people from being charged with witchcraft. The book was important by being one of the first to move away from mediaeval superstition during the Renaissance. However, King James I believed in witchcraft. When he read the book, he ordered all copies to be burnt. ==References== * Encyclopedia of British writers, 16th and 17th centuries. (2005). Book Builders LLC. p. 348.
