He served from 1806 until his removal in 1837. Known for his military and administrative skills, Thapa played a key role in consolidating the early Shah Dynasty rule and modernizing Nepal's military. He was instrumental in resisting British influence in Nepal during the early 19th century. == Early life and background == Bhimsen Thapa was born in the Gorkha district of Nepal. He belonged to the Magar ethnic group, specifically the Bagale sub-caste, and rose from a humble background to become a powerful figure in Nepalese politics. His family and community roots were deeply connected to the **Magar** people, who were primarily in the western regions of Nepal. == Political career == Thapa became the Mukhtiyar (Prime Minister) in 1806, under King Rana Bahadur Shah. During his tenure, he worked to strengthen Nepal's military and administrative structures. He is credited with initiating reforms in the army and establishing centralized control over the kingdom. == Contributions and legacy == Bhimsen Thapa is remembered for his role in defending Nepal's sovereignty, particularly during the Anglo-Nepalese War. His military strategies were critical in resisting foreign interference, although Nepal eventually signed the Treaty of Sugauli in 1815, which ceded some territories to the British. Despite facing opposition and challenges, Thapa remained a key figure in Nepalese politics until his removal and subsequent death in 1839. == Death and aftermath == Bhimsen Thapa died in 1839 after being removed from power. His legacy continues to be celebrated in Nepal, especially among the **Magar** community, for his leadership and contributions to the nation. == Related pages == * Anglo-Nepalese War == Sources == * Poudel, Prithvi Narayan. \"Bhimsen Thapa: A Political Biography.\" Kathmandu: XYZ Publishers, 2000. * Gellner, David N. \"Ethnicity, Nationalism, and the Politics of the State in Nepal.\" Oxford University Press, 2001. * Beverley, J.
