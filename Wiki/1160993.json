 "text": "The Great Michigan Fire were forest fires in the state of Michigan in the United States in 1871. They may have been caused (or made worse) by the same winds that created the Great Chicago Fire, the Peshtigo Fire and the Port Huron Fire. Some people think lightning or even meteor showers may have started the fires. Many cities, towns and villages like Alpena, Holland, Manistee, and Port Huron, were very damaged or destroyed. The Peshtigo Fire that happened at the same time in Wisconsin also destroyed several towns in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. == Related pages == * Peshtigo fire of 1871 * Great Chicago Fire of 1871 == References == Category:Fires in the United States Category:Natural disasters in the United States",
