 "text": "The PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is Sony's first video game console to be released as a handheld. Designed and developed by Sony in Japan, it was first released there on December 12, 2004. It was later released in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe on September 1, 2005. It was first announced in 2003 at E3. Its first design was shown off the following year. In addition to video games, the PSP can also be used for playing or displaying music, video, and pictures. To transfer data to a PSP, a USB cable must be used in order to send these files from another device, such as a computer. Games, as well as movies, were released for the PSP on the \"Universal Media Disc\" (UMD), a specially designed optical disc contained within a plastic enclosure. The UMD can hold up to 1.8 GB of data, far more than a CD, but still less than a DVD. A Memory Stick Pro Duo can be used for additional data storage. The PlayStation Portable is the first handheld game console to use a disc as its media storage instead of a cartridge. On January 31, 2014, shipments of the PlayStation Portable ceased in North America. Shipments ceased in Japan on June 30, 2014, and in Europe by the end of 2014. ==Games and movies== There are over 700 games for the PSP. The movies look like the DVD. The reason the PSP can have movies is because the disc (Universal Media Disc) has a lot of memory space. In many countries, Spider-Man 2 (the movie) was included for free with the console. ==Wireless== The PSP, with the exception of the PSP-E1000, has built in Wi-Fi. This allows players who are traveling to download items, surf the web and play online. The Playstation Portable, until July 2, 2021, could access the PlayStation Store to purchase games and Downloadable Content in supported games. The PlayStation Portable can also connect with the PlayStation 3 as a sort of remote control for movie playback and for downloading content. The Playstation 3 is also able to download PSP games through it's Playstation Store and transfer the games over USB. ==Versions== There are five versions of the PlayStation Portable, the PSP-1000 (also known as \"PSP fat\"), PSP-2000 (\"slim and light\" edition, a lighter version of the original PSP), PSP-3000 (\"bright and light\" edition, that includes a built in microphone and improved LCD), PSP-N1000 (or PSP Go, with a sliding screen design, bluetooth and internal storage of 16GB replacing the UMD drive.The PSP Go Improvements, 2006. ElecPress.) and PSP-E1000 (similar to PSP-3000, but without stereo sound, Wi-Fi and microphone). Sony subsequently released the successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, in Japan on December 17, 2011 and starting worldwide on February 22, 2012. ==Competition== The PlayStation Portable is similar to the Nintendo DS, because they are both for games you can take with you. However, Nintendo and Sony said they were made for different people. The DS has sold more units than the PSP. ==References== Category:2004 establishments Category:2014 disestablishments Category:Handheld game consoles Category:PlayStation (brand) Category:Sony Category:Sony consoles",
