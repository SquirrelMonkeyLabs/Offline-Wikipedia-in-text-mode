Buhler's residents were mostly Mennonite families that had moved from Russia during the 1880s. In September 2012, the City of Buhler received a letter from the Freedom from Religion Foundation about a complaint about a violation of the Constitution. This was because the city seal had a cross in it. In November 2012, the city said that every legal opinion it got said the city would not be able to defend itself in court if it was sued to force it to remove the seal and sign. If the city lost, it would have to pay all the legal costs of the winning party. The city decided to have a contest in January 2013 to change the design of the city seal without religion in it.Cross on Buhler signs spur complaint; The Hutchinson News; November 23, 2012.City of Buhler sign must go because of lawsuit threat; KSN tv; November 27, 2012. ==Geography== Buhler is at (38.138393, -97.770538).
