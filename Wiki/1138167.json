 "text": "Hyloxalus yasuni is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 19.0 to 25.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 21.3 to 28.9 mm long. The skin of the frog's back helps the frog hide. It is black or dark brown in color. There are lighter lines down the sides of the frog's body. Adult male frogs have brown throats and chests with white marks. Adult female frogs have cream or blurry brown marks. The adult male frog has a white belly with brown marks. The female frog has a cream-white belly. ==Name== Scientists named this frog yasuni for the place where they first found it: Parque Nacional Yasuní. ==Home== Scientists found this frog between 200 and 1095 meters above sea level in the Amazon Basin and the east side of the Andes Mountains. It lives in tropical forests in streams with rocks in them. It is awake during the day. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Cayambe Coca, Parque Nacional Yasuní, Parque Nacional Sumaco Napo-Galeras, Reserva de Producción Faunística Cuyabeno, and Reserva Biológica Limoncocha. ==Young== The male frog sits on or near rocks and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs until they hatch. After they hatch, the adult male frog carries the frog to streams. Scientists saw male frogs of this species do this. One male frog had 13 tadpoles on his back at the same time. The tadpole is clear-brown in color There are two light marks on either side of the mouth. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, in some places, the frog might be in danger because people cut down trees to get wood to build with, make farms, and make places for cows to eat grass. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
