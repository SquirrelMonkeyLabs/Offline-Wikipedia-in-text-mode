The goal is to reclaim land on Super Earth that was colonized by invading by a group of invading bug creatures called Terminids and robots called Automatons, and a zombie-like race called the Illuminite. ==Reception== The game was very liked by game critics. Critics said that they liked the combat and multiplayer co-op of the game. However, the release was criticized because of the game crashing many times during play and the ability to connect to other players. Helldivers 2 sold very well as well. It sold over 8 million copies since 15 March 2024, with over 450,000 simultaneous players on Steam. ==References== ==Other websites== * *Helldivers 2 Main Theme - \"A Cup Of Liber-Tea\" *Helldivers 2 Main Theme \"A Cup of Liber-Tea\" Trimmed Category:2024 video games Category:Military science fiction video games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Science fiction shooter video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Windows games",
