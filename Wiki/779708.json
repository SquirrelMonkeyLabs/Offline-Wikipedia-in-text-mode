 "text": "An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines is one of 15 members of the Philippine Supreme Court, the highest court in the Philippines. The Chief Justice is in charge over the High Court, but carries only one of the 15 votes in the court. Until 1973, only men were appointed as Associate Justices to the Court. Cecilia Mu√±oz-Palma, an appointee of then-dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was the first woman to sit on the Court. Since then, 15 other women have been appointed as Associate Justices of the Supreme Court. ==References== * The Supreme Court E-library * * * Category:Politics of the Philippines",
