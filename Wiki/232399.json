 "text": "In chemistry, Polytetrafluoroethylene (often shortened to PTFE) is a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene. It is a fluoropolymer, because the polymerization is based on strong covalent bonds of fluorine and carbon. Polytetrafluoroethylene is not very reactive. It also repels oil and water. E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company developed it in 1938. It is better known by its trade-names, Teflon and Gore-Tex. Teflon is a coating for cookware and other tools. Gore- Tex is stretched PTFE, used as a membrane in clothing. == Problems == Perfluorooctanoic acid was formerly used to produce Polytetrafluoroethylene. It is very toxic for people and may cause cancer. In the 2010s it was replaced with other chemicals. The precursors for many chemical weapons are highly corrosive, so their containers are often treated with Polytetrafluoroethylene. For this reason, the export of Polytetrafluoroethylene from the European Union may need a special permit. Category:Polymers",
