 "text": "Phyllomedusa chaparroi is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have only seen it in two places. People have seen this frog between 537 and 650 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 67.9 to 77.5 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog looks like Phyllomedusa camba. Scientists looked at the frogs' mitochondrial DNA to tell the two species apart. The iris of the eye is red- brown in color with tiny orange spots. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that are growing back. People saw this frog at night near ponds that dry up for part of the year. They were on plants .5-1.5 meters above the ground. The female frog lays her eggs in a nest that she makes out of foam. She makes the nest on a leaf hanging over the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large space. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
