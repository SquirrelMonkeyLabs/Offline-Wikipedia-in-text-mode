 "text": "The Dali Man () is a extinct human relative that was found in China in 1978. Its exact placement in the human genus is argued over by scientists, some theories include it being a later member of homo erectus, an early modern human, or a part of its own species Homo daliensis. The exact dating of the Dali Man is also subject to debate. == Taxonomy == The skull has a large brow- ridge that curves over each eye; unlike the straight brow-ridges of the Peking Man. During fossilization the upper jaw was damaged and dislocated upwards, making the face look shorter then expected.Wu R.
