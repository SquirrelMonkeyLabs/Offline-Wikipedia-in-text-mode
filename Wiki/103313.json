 "text": "Osnabrück () is a district (Landkreis) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is near the districts of Emsland, Cloppenburg, Vechta and Diepholz, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (districts of Minden-Lübbecke, Herford, Gütersloh, Warendorf and Steinfurt) and the City of Osnabrück. == History == The district is almost the same as the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück which existed until 1803. When the clerical states of Germany were dissolved, Osnabrück became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which in turn fell to Prussia in 1866. The district was established in 1972 by merging four old districts (Osnabrück, Melle, Bersenbrück, Wittlage). == Geography == The landscape is characterised by two mountain chains: the Wiehengebirge in the north and the northern foothills of the Teutoburg Forest in the south. These chains go around the City of Osnabrück. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows the Bennoturm (\"Benno's Tower\") of Bad Iburg, which served as the fortress of the bishops until 1673. There is also a wheel displayed in the coat of arms, which is the heraldic symbol of the City of Osnabrück. == Cities and municipalities == Cities Free municipalities Samtgemeinden Samtgemeinden #Bad Iburg #Bramsche #Dissen #Georgsmarienhütte #Melle #Bad Essen #Bad Laer #Bad Rothenfelde #Belm #Bissendorf #Bohmte #Glandorf #Hagen #Hasbergen #Hilter #Ostercappeln #Wallenhorst *1.
