 "text": "The German Shepherd (), also known as the Alsatian, is a breed of medium-large size dog. It was first developed in Germany. They are often used as police dogs, but they have many other uses. They have been variously used as herding dogs, guard dogs, military dogs, eyes for the blind and as pets. Because of their intelligence, speed, drive, eagerness and balance, they are now called 'multi-terrain' dogs as well as 'most complete dog breed' for their versatility, adaptability and suitability. An important modern use is in search and rescue. In former times the American Rescue Dog Association only used air-scenting Alsatians to locate people who are missing or lost. They search in wilderness, disaster, human body remains and water search and rescue and recovery missions. The breed is smart, athletic and can live in a wide variety of climate conditions. Male German Shepherds usually weigh around . Females usually weigh around . The term Alsatian wolf dog, instead of German Shepherd dog, was first popularly used by the British in the First World War. This was because the country was at war with the German Empire. Adolf Hitler, a German dictator, was also known to have German Shepherds as companions. The German Shepherd Dog breed, as it is currently known, was developed by the founder and the first president of the Association for the German Shepherd Dog breed Max Emil Friedrich von Stephanitz at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. ==Gallery== File:Adult male German shepherd dog standing at the beach.jpg|German Shepherd File:Schwarzer DSH.jpg|A completely black puppy File:Standbild eines Deutschen Schaeferhundes.jpg|Grey variety of a German Shepherd File:Blindenhund.jpg|A German Shepherd used as an assistance dog for blind people File:French Urban Search and Rescue.jpg|German Shepherd, used as search and rescue dogs in a collapsed building File:Rin Tin Tin 1929.JPG|Rin Tin Tin, early canine movie stars File:Horand von Grafrath SZ1 aka Hektor Linksrheim.jpg|Horand von Grafrath - the first German Shepherd Dog File:Max von Stephanitz.png|Max von Stephanitz - founder of the breed and first president of the Association for the German Shepherd Dog breed File:GERMAN SHEPHERD IN WORD AND PICTURE.jpg|The German Shepherd Dog Book In Word And Picture File:German Shepherd dog. “Canis lupus familiaris”.jpg|German Shepherd Dog - a general bone extructure File:Ryan Parr and his German Shepherd partner Kahr.
