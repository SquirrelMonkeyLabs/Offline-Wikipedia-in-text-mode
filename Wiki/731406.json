 "text": "Jesús Alfonso Huerta Escoboza (4 January 1966 – 11 January 2020), better known as La Parka or La Parka II, was a Mexican masked professional wrestler (). He worked for the professional wrestling promotion AAA from the mid-1990s until 2019. He was born in Hermosillo, Sonora. Escoboza was not the first wrestler to use the ring name \"La Parka\". Adolfo Tapia was the first \"La Parka\" but did not own the trademark or copyright on the name or the character. In the late 1990s, Escoboza was billed as \"La Parka Jr.\". In 2003, he became the \"official\" La Parka. Tapia was forced to stop using the name and instead became known as L.A. Park. Escoboza was badly injured in an October 2019 wrestling match. On 11 January 2020, he died of lung and kidney failure as a result of his injuries. He was 54. ==References== ==Other websites== *AAA profile Category:1966 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from multiple organ failure Category:Deaths from renal failure Category:Deaths from respiratory failure Category:Mexican professional wrestlers",
