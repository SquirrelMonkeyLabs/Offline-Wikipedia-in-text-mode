 "text": "A head-up display, or heads-up display, also known as a HUD () or head-up guidance system (HGS) is a transparent display that shows information without users needing to change their view. The name comes from a pilot being able to see information with the head \"up\" looking forward and not looking down. A HUD also helps a pilot's eyes since they do not need to refocus how they see. HUDs were first used for military aircraft. Now they are in commercial aircraft, automobiles, and in used in other products. == See also == * Augmented reality * Smartglasses == References == == Other websites == * Rochester Archives Article—'Buccaneer HUD PDU' * BBC Article—'Pacman comes to life virtually' * 'Clinical evaluation of the 'head-up' display of anesthesia data' * 'When will the Head-up go Civil' – Flight 1968 archive * 'Elliott Brothers to BAE SYSTEMS' – a short history of Elliott Brothers * Head-up Over the Hills – a 1964 Flight International article on flying using an early Specto head-up display * Jaguar Unveils 'Virtual Widescreen' Technology to Assist Drivers – Latin Post * The story of how all Miramar Tomcat squadrons got the funds to purchase riflescopes to attach to the HUD of their F-14 fighter jets Category:Optical devices Category:Automotive technologies",
