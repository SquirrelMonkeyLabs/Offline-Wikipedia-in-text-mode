She served as the 44th Lieutenant Governor of Iowa from January 1991 through January 15, 1999 during the governorship of Terry Branstad. She was a member of the Republican Party. Corning entered the 1998 Republican Gubernatorial primary making history as the first woman to run for the Republican nomination to the office of Governor in the state’s history. After an abbreviated gubernatorial campaign, she was forced to drop out due in large part to a lack of financial support. Corning was born in Bridgewater, Iowa. She graduated from the University of Northern Iowa. Corning died May 20, 2017 from liver disease in Cedar Falls, Iowa at the age of 84. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Educators from Iowa Category:People from Cedar Falls, Iowa Category:Lieutenant Governors of Iowa Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
