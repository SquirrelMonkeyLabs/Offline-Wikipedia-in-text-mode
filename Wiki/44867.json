 "text": "Stargate Atlantis is a television series. It is a spin-off of the Stargate SG-1 series. The series starts at the beginning of the eighth season of Stargate SG-1. Mika McKinnon was a science adviser for this show and Stargate Universe. == Story == The main subject of the seventh season of Stargate SG-1 was researching and locating the city of the Ancients. At the end of the seventh season, SG-1 discovered that the city is on Earth, under the ices of Antarctica. But it was in fact only a beachhead. Doctor Daniel Jackson finds the coordinates of the real city. Its name is Atlantis (the legendary ancient city), and it's in the Pegasus galaxy. The address was hard to find because it needs eight chevrons, the seventh of which is used to indicate the galaxy. ==References== == Other websites == *MGM: Stargate Atlantis *SCI FI: Stargate Atlantis * *Stargate Atlantis episode guide at GateWorld *Stargate Atlantis Links Directory at GateGuide Category:2004 television series debuts Category:2009 Canadian television series endings Category:American drama television series Category:Canadian television series Category:Science fiction television series Category:Stargate Category:Television spin-offs Category:English-language television programs",
