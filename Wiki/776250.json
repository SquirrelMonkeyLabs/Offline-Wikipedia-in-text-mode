 "text": "Phineas P. Gage (July 9, 1823 - May 21, 1860) was an American railroad construction foreman. He is known for his unlikely survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe. This caused effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his life. Gage was born in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He died on May 21, 1860 in the San Francisco Bay Area from status epilepticus (a form of a seizure), aged 36. ==Gallery== File:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg| File:Phineas Gage injury - animation (frontal lobe).gif| File:Simulated Connectivity Damage of Phineas Gage 4 vanHorn PathwaysDamaged.jpg| File:Gage reconstruction (Ratiu et al.).png| File:Simulated Connectivity Damage of Phineas Gage SkullDisplayWarren.jpg| phineas gage is a roaman be careful off him ==References== Category:1823 births Category:1860 deaths Category:Deaths from epilepsy Category:People from Vermont Category:People from New Hampshire",
