 "text": "Pittier's Little Frog (Allobates pittieri) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in forests. It usually lives near streams but can go far from them. These frogs eat ants. Scientists have seen the frog between 115 and 1700 meters above sea level. The place where this frog lives has at least six protected parks in it: Juan Crisóstomo Falcón National Park, Morrocoy National Park, San Esteban National Park, Henri Pittier National Park, Yacambú National Park, and Guáquira Ecological Reserve. Scientists think it could live in Terepaima National Park, Tirgua National Park and Yasuni National Park too. ==Young== After the eggs hatch, the male adult frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. In some places, people cut down forests to make places for tourists and to make farms, for example coffee farms. Fires and bad chemicals can also hurt this frog. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could hurt this frog. Scientists have found the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on the frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
