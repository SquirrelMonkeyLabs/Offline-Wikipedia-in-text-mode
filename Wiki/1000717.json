Depending on the nature of the film genre, the dubbing is either in standard Arabic, or features a dialect. Oddly, the selection of dubbed films are the type of films that naturally don't get broadcast on MBC Max due to their extreme violent nature. Starting from January 9, 2010, MBC 1 now features one dubbed film at the usual timings every day of the week, including Fridays, which now features MBC 1's new Bollywood films package. Any film outside of Thursday will retain to comply with MBC1's standardized content, but they can still also be viewed in their original languages. The currently known Thursday selection of August 2010 includes: * Braveheart * The Lord of the Rings * Troy (The regular schedule is to be on hiatus after August 11, due to the expansion of the overall film schedule during the month of Ramadan.) Around April 2010, with MBC 1's increased library of dubbed films, MBC apparently are now giving more random schedules for films with Arabic dubs, alongside the usual schedules. This is most likely due to the increased popularity and interest in the dubbing of American films. Despite the fact MBC created this package for the entertainment of watching dubbed Hollywood films, nevertheless they gave their viewers a choice of switching audio tracks if they want to watch these particular films in their original English tracks, as well as adding subtitles for the viewers who can support this feature. It is currently unknown if this package is permanent. It is likely all the dubbing was produced in-house, which would most likely be the reason why MBC retains exclusivity to these dubbed films/audio tracks as they do not appear anywhere else, and it seems apparent the dubbing was primarily performed by Syrian voice-actors. This limit, however, is lifted in MBC Drama's new dubbed films package. === Bollywood films === After debuting on January 15, 2010, MBC 1 is scheduled to make a weekly broadcast, every Friday, of a selection of Hindi films. However, these films will be primarily available dubbed in Arabic for MBC 1's majority Arab audience. The currently known selection of August 2010 includes: * Salaam Namaste (The regular schedule is to be on hiatus after August 11, due to the expansion of the overall film schedule during the month of Ramadan). This package is partially jointed with MBC 1's dubbed films package. Which means despite the fact MBC created this package for the entertainment of watching dubbed Bollywood films. === Ramadan Broadcasting === Beginning from this Ramadan, MBC1 is playing movies without commercial breaks, although, some movies may have a one-minute break every once in a while. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Iraqi culture Category:2019 establishments in Asia Category:Television channels in Asia",
