 "text": "Qusay Saddam Hussein al-Nasiri al-Tikriti (Arabic: قصي صدام حسين; 17 May 1966 – 22 July 2003) was an Iraqi politician and military leader. He was the second son of Saddam Hussein, who was President of Iraq from 1979 to 2003. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Qusay was killed in a U.S. raid in Mosul. His son Mustafa and his brother Uday were also killed in the raid. == Career == During his father's reign in Iraq, Qusay led the Republican Guard, an all-volunteer branch of the Iraqi military. According to one source, the Republican Guard was \"a heavily armed paramilitary group connected with the ruling party.\" Saddam chose Qusay to take power after he died. However, Saddam was removed from power and arrested during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and Qusay was killed before he could take Saddam's place. Although he had a lower public profile compared to his brother Uday, Qusay had a key role in crushing opposition during the 1991 Iraqi uprisings. According to one source: > Following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, [Qusay] led a violent crackdown on > uprisings and held key positions within Iraq's intelligence and security > forces... His [leadership] was marked by severe human rights abuses, > including mass executions and torture of political prisoners. == Death == On July 22, 2003, Qusay was killed in a three-hour gunfight with U.S. forces along with his brother Uday and son Mustafa. According to one source: > [The deaths of Qusay and Uday were] highly publicized... Although their > deaths were intended to undermine resistance against U.S. troops, they did > not significantly diminish the ongoing insurgency in Iraq. == References == == Related pages == * Saddam Hussein * Execution of Saddam Hussein * 2003 invasion of Iraq Category:1966 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm Category:Iraqi military people Category:Iraqi politicians Category:Iraq War Category:Military people killed in action Category:Iraqi murderers Category:Torture Category:People from Tikrit",
