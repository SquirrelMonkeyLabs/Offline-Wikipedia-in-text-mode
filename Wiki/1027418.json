 "text": "The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first inter-city railway in the world. It opened on 15 September 1830 between the Lancashire cities of Liverpool and Manchester. It was also the first railway to only have locomotives driven by steam power, with no horse-drawn traffic permitted at any time; the first to be entirely double track; the first to have a true signalling system; the first to be fully timetabled; and the first to carry mail. It was designed and built by George Stephenson. It made money, and influenced the development of railways across Britain in the 1830s. ==References== Category:Railway lines of England Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 19th century Category:Buildings and structures in Lancashire Category:1830 establishments in the United Kingdom",
