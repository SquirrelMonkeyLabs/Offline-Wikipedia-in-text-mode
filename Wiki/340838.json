The area around the capital city is busy with farming activities like growing cotton and sugarcane. Cotton used to be very important for the country's economy, but its growth slowed during the Angolan Civil War. Now, agriculture is coming back, and many international investors are helping. For example, Brazil gave $30 million to boost maize and sugarcane farming in Pungo Andongo. Malanje Province also grows cassava, sweet potatoes, peanuts, rice, soybeans, sunflowers, and different vegetables. Besides farming, the province has valuable resources like diamonds, limestone, manganese (which was exported in large amounts in 1973), uranium, and phosphate. Tourism is becoming more popular because of the province's natural beauty. People visit attractions like Kalandula Falls, the dark rocks of Pungo Andongo, two nature reserves, and Cangandala National Park. This park is the smallest in Angola. It was started in 1963 to protect the Giant Sable Antelope. ==List of governors of Malanje== Name Years in office Eusébio Sebastião 1977–1978 Domingos Afonso Neto 1978–1980 Col.
