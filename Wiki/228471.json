 "text": "New Zealand English is the English that is spoken in New Zealand. The words are mostly the same as in British English but are pronounced differently. Some words are found only in or have special meanings in New Zealand English. They include dairy (corner shop; small grocery shop), bach (small holiday house, usually by the beach) and heaps (lots of, i.e \"I ate heaps of pavlova last Christmas\").
