 "text": "Your Show of Shows was a 90-minute long comedy television series appearing weekly in the United States on NBC, from 1950 until June 5, 1954. The main people of the show were Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. Other people who appeared were Carl Reiner, Howard Morris, Nanette Fabray, Bill Hayes, Judy Johnson, The Hamilton Trio and the soprano Marguerite Piazza. Jos√© Ferrer also appeared on the show sometimes, as a guest. Writers for the show included Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Danny Simon, Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin, and Carl Reiner who, though a cast member, always sat in with the writers. There is a common misconception that Woody Allen wrote for Your Show of Shows and Caesar's Hour. A look through Mr. Allen's memoir Apropos Of Nothing, shows his work for Caesar was limited The Sid Caesar Show, a special that aired in 1958. ==Other websites== * * *The Sid Caesar Collection Category:American comedy television series Category:NBC network series Category:English-language television programs",
