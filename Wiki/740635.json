In a June 2016 interview with Forbes, Baszucki stated that the idea for Roblox was inspired by the success of his Interactive Physics and Working Model software applications, especially among young students. Baszucki owns a roughly 13% stake in the Roblox Corporation, the company that owns Roblox, a stake estimated to be worth around $470 million as of 2020. He said he would donate any future compensation he earns from Roblox's listing on the New York Stock Exchange for philanthropic purposes.

According to Business Insider, Baszucki was the seventh-highest- paid CEO in 2021, making $232.8 million. == References == Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American computer engineers Category:American inventors Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Roblox",
