 "text": "David Reimer (born Bruce Peter Reimer; 22 August 1965 â€“ 4 May 2004) was a Canadian man who was born male but raised as a girl following medical advice and after his penis was badly injured during a circumcision gone wrong in infancy. He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Reimer's parents were told to raise him as a girl by Dr John Money. He displayed a lot of masculine behavior, including urinating while standing up over the toilet. Reimer realized that he was not a girl between the ages of 9 and 11 years. He reverted to living as a male at age 15. His surgery gone wrong has been used as an example of what not to do and became known as the \"John/Joan\" case. Reimer later went public with his story to help people not go through similar medical practices. Reimer, who was suffering from depression, killed himself on 4 May 2004 in Winnipeg after shooting himself outside a grocery store, aged 38. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Suicides by firearm Category:American activists Category:Twin people from Canada Category:Transgender people Category:People from Winnipeg Category:Suicides in Canada",
