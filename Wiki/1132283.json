 "text": "A hot desert climate is a type of arid climate that has extremely low precipitation. Conditions are dry and desert-like because there is more evaporation than precipitation. Rainfall is irregular and usually happens in short, intense bursts. Temperatures can vary widely, but summers are usually hot (sometimes scorching) while winters are usually mild to cool. == Classification == The Köppen climate chart classifies an arid climate as \"BW.\" A Russo-German climatologist named Wladimir Köppen defined this type of climate in 1900. Arid climates are typically found between latitudes 15° and 30° N and S. There are vast desert regions in North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of central and western Asia. Based on temperature patterns and seasonal variations, arid climates are further divided into hot deserts (BWh), like the Sahara, and cold deserts (BWk), like the Gobi Desert.
