 "text": "The EE Rising Star Award, formerly known as the Orange Rising Star Award, is one of the award categories for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). It is for new talents in the acting industry. The award was made after Mary Selway's death in 2004. She helped many new actors and actresses to fame. The five nominees can be any nationality and either gender. Their breakthrough can be in television, film or both. The nominees are chosen by the BAFTA juries. The winner is chosen entirely by the public votes by text, internet or phone. This award was sponsored by Orange UK until 2012. From 2013, it was sponsored by EE. ==Winners and nominees== Bold Indactes Winner === 2000s === Year Recipient 2005 (59th) James McAvoy Chiwetel Ejiofor Gael García Bernal Rachel McAdams Michelle Williams 2006 (60th) Eva Green Emily Blunt Naomie Harris Cillian Murphy Ben Whishaw 2007 (61st) Shia LaBeouf Sienna Miller Elliot Page Sam Riley Tang Wei 2008 (62nd) Noel Clarke Michael Cera Michael Fassbender Rebecca Hall Toby Kebbell 2009 (63rd) Kristen Stewart Jesse Eisenberg Nicholas Hoult Carey Mulligan Tahar Rahim === 2010s === Year Recipient 2010 (64th) Tom Hardy Gemma Arterton Andrew Garfield Aaron Johnson Emma Stone 2011 (65th) Adam Deacon Chris Hemsworth Tom Hiddleston Chris O'Dowd Eddie Redmayne 2012 (66th) Juno Temple Elizabeth Olsen Andrea Riseborough Suraj Sharma Alicia Vikander 2013 (67th) Will Poulter Dane DeHaan George MacKay Lupita Nyong'o Léa Seydoux 2014 (68th) Jack O'Connell Gugu Mbatha-Raw Margot Robbie Miles Teller Shailene Woodley 2015 (69th) John Boyega Taron Egerton Dakota Johnson Brie Larson Bel Powley 2016 (70th) Tom Holland Laia Costa Lucas Hedges Ruth Negga Anya Taylor-Joy 2017 (71st) Daniel Kaluuya Timothée Chalamet Josh O'Connor Florence Pugh Tessa Thompson 2018 (72nd) Letitia Wright Jessie Buckley Cynthia Erivo Barry Keoghan Lakeith Stanfield 2019 (73rd) Micheal Ward Awkwafina Kaitlyn Dever Kelvin Harrison Jr. Jack Lowden === 2020s === Year Recipient 2020 (74th) Bukky Bakray Kingsley Ben-Adir Morfydd Clark Ṣọpẹ Dìrísù Conrad Khan 2021 (75th) Lashana Lynch Ariana DeBose Harris Dickinson Millicent Simmonds Kodi Smit-McPhee 2022 (76th) Emma Mackey Naomi Ackie Sheila Atim Daryl McCormack Aimee Lou Wood 2023 (77th) Mia McKenna-Bruce Phoebe Dynevor Ayo Edebiri Jacob Elordi Sophie Wilde ==Other websites== * The EE Rising Star Award at BAFTA Category:BAFTA Awards",
