 "text": "Meanness refers to personality in the form of which, according to many including Aristotle, has the characteristics for being low. In modern forms, though, the word refers to intense hatred, contempt, cruelty and being hostile toward everybody else. ==Classical forms== For his dictionary, Noah Webster (1758â€“1843) indicated meanness was \"the want of excellence\", \"want of rank\", \"the lowness of mind\" or \"low esteem\". ==Modern forms== Under modern forms, being mean refers to being very nasty, being cruel and not having any or proper generosity. In fact, being mean can be sometimes mistaken for or mixed up with when somebody is stern or condescending. Bullying, aggression, violence, narcissism and being ruthless are other examples for being mean. ==References== Category:Emotions Category:Psychiatry Category:Psychology Category:Relationships Category:Human behavior",
