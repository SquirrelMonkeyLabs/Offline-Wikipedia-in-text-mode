 "text": "Tanganyika was a territory in Africa, administered by Great Britain from 1916 to 1961. The territory was roughly equivalent to the part of modern-day Tanzania, which is on the African continent, without the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, but with the Island of Mafia. Before 1916, it was part of German East Africa. German East Africa included other territories as well. The territory was named after Lake Tanganyika, on its eastern border. In 1961, Tanzania became independent, with the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, as well. == Related pages == * Tanganyika Category:History of Tanzania Category:Former British colonies Category:Former colonies in Africa",
