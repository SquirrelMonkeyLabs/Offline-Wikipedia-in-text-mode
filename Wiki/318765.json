 "text": "The 2014 Atlantic hurricane season was a below-average season in terms of named storms, and an average season in terms of both hurricanes and major hurricanes. It produced nine tropical cyclones, eight named storms, the fewest since the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes. It officially began on June 1, 2014, and ended on November 30, 2014. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first storm of the season, Arthur, developed on July 1, while the final storm, Hanna, dissipated on October 28, about a month prior to the end of the season ==Storm names== This is the list of names used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2014. The list is the same as the 2008 list except for Gonzalo, Isaias, and Paulette because Gustav, Ike, and Paloma were damaging and deadly storms in 2008, and their names were retired. In 2014 no storms were retired so the same exact list was used in 2020. * Arthur * Bertha * Cristobal * Dolly * Edouard * Fay * Gonzalo * Hanna * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Notes== ==References== Category:2014 disasters",
