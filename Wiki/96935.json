 "text": "Black bread molds (Rhizopus stolonifer) is a common type of fungus. It grows and reproduces the same way that most molds do. In asexual reproduction, the mold makes spores inside a sporangium. When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold, the sporangium breaks open door and lets the spores float out of the world. In sexual reproduction its hyphaes touch the hyphae of another Rhizopus mycelium. When they fuse, they make round balls called zygospores. After some time, the zygospore makes another sporangium, which then makes spores. During this sexual process, genetic recombination takes place, as with all eukaryotes. When the spores land on a suitable place, they begin to grow. They very quickly start making hyphae, small tendrils that look like roots. Hyphae are part of the mycelium. The mycelium is the main part of the mold, and grows inside the bread. Black bread mold grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees Celsius and lower than 5Â°C.Schipper M.A.A. 1984. A revision of the genus Rhizopus. I. The Rh. stolonifer-group and Rh. oryzae. CBS Studies in Mycology 25:1-19. Black bread mold is found in all countries of the world. It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes. Because the mold spores are airborne. == Related pages == * Mycorrhiza * Mould * Fungus ==References== ==Other websites== * Time lapse video of Rhizopus stolonifer attacking strawberries at the Cornell Mushroom Blog. * Black mold - Ill health effects & its removal- A DIY Guide Toronto Category:Moulds",
