 "text": "Go First, founded as GoAir, was an Indian low-cost airline based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Owned by the Indian business conglomerate Wadia Group, it commenced operations on 4 November 2005 and operated a fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft in an all-economy configuration. In 2021, the airline had planned to raise â‚¹36 billion (around US$470 million) by launching an Initial Public Offering (IPO). However, in 2023, the airline ran into major problems because of issues with the availability of Pratt & Whitney engines, which powered all of its A320 aircraft. These engine problems made it hard for the airline to run its flights properly. As a result, the airline stopped all operations on 3 May 2023. It then filed for voluntary insolvency with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is the authority in India that deals with cases related to companies that are unable to pay their debts. ==References== Category:Airlines",
