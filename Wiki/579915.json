 "text": "Cináeda mac Ailpín (Modern Gaelic: Coinneach mac Ailpein; 810 — 13 February 858) often known as Kenneth I and nicknamed the Conqueror (Scottish Gaelic: an Conqueror) was the King of Scotland from 843 until his death in 858. He was also the King of the Picts from 843 to 858 and the King of Dál Riata from 841 until the disestablishment of the title in 850. He was the first Scottish king. However, according to Scottish mythology, he was the sixty-ninth Scottish king. However, there is little evidence to prove this. He inherited the throne of Dál Riata from his father, Alpin II (Alpin mac Echdach), founder of the Alpínid dynasty. Kenneth conquered the kingdom of the Picts in 843 after defeating the Pictish king, Drest X. Kenneth became the fist Pictish king to rule under the Alpínid dynasty. He started a campaign to conquer all of Scotland and assimilate the Picts which eventually gave him his nickname, \"the Conqueror\". Forteviot became the capital of his kingdom. He fought of the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Vikings where he kicked both of their troops off of Scotland and where Kenneth eventually defeated them. Kenneth also relocated relics including the Stone of Scone from Iona Abbey in Iona to his new domain. Kenneth was one of Europe's most powerful rulers and was considered one of Scotland's greatest kings during his time. Because of his reputation as one of Scotland's greatest kings, he became an important figure in Scottish history. He managed to put down rebellions and invasions from other kingdoms such as the Vikings. He was the first King of Scotland. He unified the Gaels with the Picts, thus, he formed a united kingdom of Scotland. == Birth == Not much is known about Kenneth's birth except he was born around 810 in Iona, Argyllshire and was the son of King Alpin II of Dalriada, a land which covered modern day Northern Ireland and the Hebrides - Argyll. == Reign == Upon his fathers death in 839 he became king of Dalriada styled \"Cinaed, son of Alpin\" and also king of Scots due to the fact that the Hebrides - Argyll were important parts of the land at the time. At this time the Picts were conquered by Vikings with Bridei VI of Pictland being defeated, and Kenneth was set to become the next monarch. Although it wasn't until 843 he became king of the now united Pictish & Scottish tribes. == Death == On February 13, 858 in Forteviot, Kenneth died of natural causes. He was buried in Iona and succeeded by his brother Donald MacAlpin or Domnall MacAilpín. == Family (children) == Name Date of Birth Date of Death Gender Monarch of NN ingen Cináed c. 834 Unknown Female (none) Constantine I, king of Picts and Scots c. 836 (maybe 832) 877 (definitely) Male Scotland/Pictland Áed, king of Picts and Scots 838 (definitely) 878 (definitely) Male Scotland/Pictland Máel Muire ni Cináeda 842 (definitely) 912 (definitely) Female High Queen of Ireland (maybe) Máel Muire of Ireland Before Feb 858 Unknown ??????
