 "text": "In the US and Canada, cars are identified by model year (MY), unlike other countries that use production dates or codes. \"MY\" often precedes the year (e.g., MY2019). The new model year usually starts in August or September of the previous year, but can be earlier. This practice began in the 1920s with yearly styling updates to encourage new car purchases. In the mid-1930s, this was standardized to stabilize auto industry employment. Regulations allow selling the next model year as early as January 2nd of the previous year. Recreational vehicles have even more leeway, allowing a model year up to two years before manufacturing. == References == Category:Automobiles",
