 "text": "Organofluorine compounds are a kind of chemical compound. These compounds have a carbon–fluorine bond. This group of compounds are all organic compounds. == Types == There are different types of these compounds. They include: *Fluorocarbons or Perfluorocarbon. These contain fluorine and carbon. They are commonly used for insulation *Fluoropolymers; \"Teflon\", or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), is a famous fluoropolymer. These are fluorocarbon-based polymers. They have some carbon–fluorine bonds. These compounds are resistant to solvents, acids and bases. *Hydrofluorocarbons. These contain hydrogen, carbon and fluorine. They are used as refrigerants. Fluoromethane has the lowest mass (of the compounds in the HFC family). *Fluorocarbenes. These are used in water proofing as sealants and as lubricants. **difluorocarbene. These are highly reactive. They are used to make Teflon. *Perfluorinated compounds. Used to make many different products. These include Teflon, stain resistant fabrics and fire fighting foam",
