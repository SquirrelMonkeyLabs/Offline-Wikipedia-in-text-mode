 "text": "Charlotte Harland Scott (born 13 November 1963 in Blackheath, London) is a British-born Zambian economic and social development specialist. She was the First Lady of Zambia from October 2014 to January 2015. Her husband, Guy Scott, was acting President following the death of Michael Sata. ==Career== Charlotte Scott has worked in the fields of economic development policy, social development policy and NGOs for more than twenty years. Sata died in office on 28 October 2014. Vice-President Guy Scott succeeded Sata as the acting President of Zambia until a by-election could be held 90 days after Sata's death. The events made Charlotte Scott the First Lady of Zambia during this time. The couple became the country's first white President and First Lady. The Scotts did not move into Government House, the residence of the country's president. Guy Scott was barred by law from running for the remainder of Sata's unexpired presidential term because the Constitution of Zambia banned presidential candidates whose parents were not born in Zambia. His parents had immigrated to present-day Zambia from England and Scotland in the United Kingdom. Charlotte Scott was succeeded by Esther Lungu on 26 January 2015. In 2016, Guy Scott decided would not seek re-election to his Lusaka Central seat in Parliament in the August general election. Charlotte Scott applied to run for her husband's seat and was endorsed by the United Party for National Development (UPND) as the party's official nominee. Scott and her main opponent, the PF's Margaret Mwanakatwe, were considered the front-runners for Lusaka Central during the election out of the five candidates for the seat. However, she was unsuccessful as Margaret Mwanakatwe won the vacant seat. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:First Ladies of Zambia Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford",
