 "text": "A musical tone is a repeating sound. Musical tones are different in duration, loudness, and timbre. The notes used in music can have many complex forms, such as short bursts, changes in pitch, and shifts in noise. A simple tone, or pure tone, has a steady noise. A complex tone is a musical tone that is not steady. Simple tones are added together to make complex tones. ==References== Category:Musical notation",
