They were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended the coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Romans' most important naval town. ==Gallery== File:Dover Seafront And Castle.jpg|Beach and castle File:Dal castello di Dover.jpg|Church of \"St Mary in Castro\" and the Roman Lighthouse File:Dover Castle 05.jpg|Dover Castle File:White cliffs of dover 09 2004.jpg|White Cliffs of Dover File:Dover Harbour panorama.jpg|Panorama of the port ==Other websites== *A History of Dover *The History of Dover Castle *Dover Castle information ==References== Category:Towns in Kent",
