The Commodore VIC-20 was powered by a 6502 CPU, running at 1 MHz. Though the system had 5KB of RAM, users only had access to about 3.5KB for BASIC programs. It had no internal data storage, but could store programs on standard audio tapes. Later, it could use 5.25 inch floppy disks as well. In early 1985 this computer was discontinued. ==References== Category:Commodore computers",
