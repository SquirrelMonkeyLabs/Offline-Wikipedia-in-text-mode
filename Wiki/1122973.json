It is the only piece of Andean rainforest in Colombia's coffee belt, or place full of coffee farms. This park is important because it is in a place where colder places meet warmer places and because it is the only piece of forest left for a long way. ==History== This park was made in 2003. Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia runs the park. The forest used to cover 9.6% of the Andes area, but now only a tiny bit is left. The forest in the park is very like the old forest that was there before human beings cut it down. ==Plants== The park has more than 458 different kinds of plants in it. Scientists named two of these plants for the park: Guzmania betancurii and Meriania selvaflorensis. ==Animals== Many different kinds of animals live in this park. At least twenty-seven threatened species live in the park, critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable. There are rain frogs, poison frogs, and glass frogs. Here are some: *Andinobates daleswansoni *Atelopus sonsonensis *Pristimantis fetosus *Pristimantis tribulosus *Pristimantis actinolaimus *Pristimantis lichenoides *Pristimantis torrenticola *Pristimantis veletis *Nymphargus spilotus Here are some birds that live in the park: *Hypopyrrhus pyrohypogaster *Odontophorus hyperythrus *Melanerpes pulcher *Habia cristata *Habia gutturalis *Atlapetes flaviceps *Capito hypoleucus *Cercomacroides parkeri *Ortalis colombiana *Picumnus granadensis *Scytalopus stilesi *Chlorochrysa nitidissima *Capito hypoleucus *Scytalopus stilesi *Hypopyrrhus pyrohypogaster *Atlapetes flaviceps *Chlorochrysa nitidissima Here are some animals with fur that live in the park: *Xenarthra *Bears *Armadillos *Foxes *Coatis *Alouatta seniculus *Aotus lemurinus *Saguinus leucopus *Cebus versicolor *Ateles hybridus Here are some animals with scales that live in the park: *Bothrops asper *Bothriechis schlegelii *Erythrolaprus *Mastigodryas *Pseustes shropshirei *Imantodes cenchoa *Anolis tolimensis ==Place== This reserve is in Colombia's Cordillera Central (Central Mountain Range) in the department of Caldas. It is in two town areas: mostly in Samaná and some in Pensilvania. It is between 850 and 2400 meters above sea level. It is 100.2 square kilometers in size. About 8000 mm of rain and other water falls there every year. People can drive to the park on the Medllín-Bogotá road, but part of it is not paved. There are also busses. People call the park Estrella Hídrica del Oriente Caldense or \"Water Star of Eastern Caldas.\" ==Problems== Sometimes, cows walk into the park. The cows step on the plants and make the water dirty. The people who run the park make deals with the cows' owners: The owners will keep the cows out of the park, and the people who run the park made water tanks for the cows to use. ==References== Category:National parks in Colombia",
