 "text": "Doom is a first-person shooter video game made by id Software in 1993. It is one of the first games to use three-dimensional levels. The game is about killing demons and zombies in order to stop an invasion. Doom has traps, including crushing ceilings, radiation pools, and exploding barrels, that can kill the player. Doom was also the first game with multiplayer deathmatch. This means you can fight with other players instead of the demons and zombies. The game was made with a computer language called C using some new techniques created by John Carmack. It has five sequels: Doom 2 that came out in 1994, Final Doom that came out in 1996, Doom 3 that came out in 2004, Doom (2016), and Doom Eternal. Doom is split into three basic components, the engine, the Iwad file, and the optional Pwad file. The engine contains the code needed to run the game on a computer. The Iwad file contains the default levels, sounds, pictures, and other components. Pwad files contain custom levels. The source code to the Doom engine was released in 1997 and can be downloaded for free. The full 3-episode and 4-episode Iwad files have not been released for free and must still be purchased. Doom is a shareware game of three episodes, each having eight standard levels and one secret level. The secret level in each episode is accessed by finding a secret exit in one of the normal levels. The episodes are Knee-Deep In The Dead, The Shores Of Hell and Inferno. In the shareware version the only episode that can be played is Knee-Deep In The Dead. The expansion pack of Doom is Ultimate Doom, which has the fourth episode, Thy Flesh Consumed. In Doom, the player can carry and use many different weapons. Each have their own special features and strengths. They are your Fists, the Pistol, Shotgun, Chaingun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Gun, BFG-9000, and Chainsaw. The player gets new weapons by finding them in the level. Most weapons can be found in more than one level. Some weapons share ammo. For example, both the Pistol and Chaingun use bullets, and the Plasma Gun and BFG both use energy cells. The player must be careful not to waste ammo because if he or she does, there may be more than one weapon that cannot be used. The Fists and Chainsaw do not have ammo limits, so the player can use them as long as they want. Doom was also made for the SNES, Sega 32X, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, 3DO, Atari Jaguar, and Game Boy Advance. It can also be downloaded online for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1993 video games Category:1990s horror video games Category:Doom (franchise) Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Atari Jaguar games Category:Classic Mac OS games Category:Cooperative video games Category:DOS games Category:First-person shooters Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Id Software games Category:IOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Sega 32X games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in hell Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
