 "text": "Photojournalism is taking photos to tell a story in mass media. The first photojournalist was Mathew Brady, who took pictures of the American Civil War. From World War II through the 1970s, many magazines and all the world's major newspapers had their own photographers. There was strong competition to take the best pictures. Later it became difficult to make money as a photojournalist, because the places to publish photos disappeared, and because there were many more photographers. ==References==",
