It was found on 1999-07-18 by John J. Kavelaars et al. and designated S/1999 U 1. B. Gladman, JJ Kavelaars, Matthew J. Holman, J-M. Petit, H. Scholl, P. Nicholson, J. A. Burnse The Discovery of Uranus XIX, XX, and XXI, Icarus, 147 (2000), pp. 320–324 Confirmed as Uranus XIX it is named after the god worshipped by Caliban and Sycorax in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Sycorax and Prospero to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.

Preprint However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The moon appears grey in the visible light, Tommy Grav, Matthew J. Holman, and Wesley C.
