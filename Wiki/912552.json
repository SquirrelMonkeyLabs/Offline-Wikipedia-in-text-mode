 "text": "Sünnet is a festival of the circumcision of boys in Turkey and other Muslim Turkic peoples, such as Volga Tatars and Crimean Tatars, as well as Balkan Muslims such as Bosnians, Albanians and Macedonians. It is based on religion and cultural traditions. Most Turkish and Balkan families have a Sünnet party for their sons in which the boy gets money and presents. More religious families have the ceremony with an imam. The age of the circumcised boys varies, but it is generally at seven to ten years old. The operation is made by a special religious cleric, the Sünnetçi (circumciser)https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953620305864i The type of Sünnet found among Albanians, Bosniaks, Torbesh, Xoraxane, Pomak and Gorani people, was taken up by the Balkan Muslims, when large parts of the Balkans belonged to the Ottoman Empire.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347164131_The_Rite_of_Male_Circumcision_among_the_Muslim_Population_in_the_Western_Balkans ==References== Category:Turkish culture Category:Islamic festivals",
