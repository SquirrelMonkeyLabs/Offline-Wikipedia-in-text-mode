 "text": "The Theory Dasbien or Das Bien (in english Give Good) is a theoretical concept linked to the paradigm of love, and based on the book \"Das Bien\" by psychologist Andy Figueroa, published on May 16, 2010. It arose from humanistic psychology and the popular perspective on love. In psychology, it is an anti-premise of the concept of love related to emotions and feelings. It affirms that loving is something good and has healthy repercussions in human life, in addition, it broadens the concept of love to different subjects such as a mother, child, pet, parent, self or any other being. Love remains the same, but the addressee changes. == Parts of the theory == Most of the theory is normative and practical. The Das Bien theory is linked to the concept or paradigm of love, conceived as a universal feeling by different organisms of society. However, it arises as an antithesis to the worldly concept of love, explaining through contemporary psychology that to love is to give something good, from the perspective of the recipient. It is good for the one who receives the feeling of love, creating \"the expression of healthy love\". Also, from a philosophical point of view, love is not about the \"I\", but about the inner and outer world of the other. This type of love is born from the learning of past experiences according to the Decision Theory. The theory suggests that love is giving, a verb with notorious particularities and that it is related to the premise: \"to give something good, according to the other\". It is not a sensation or feeling, nor is it a desire and taste, choice, much less is it giving everything. == Elements of love == * Sender: the entity that performs the action of loving. * Receiver: is a target and subject at the same time (living being that exists) that expresses what is good for it. * Activity: is the intentional action of giving love sent by the sender and received by a receiver. * Situation: represents the social, ideological and other variables that create a certain situation for an activity to take place. == Components of the act of love == The Das Bien theory conceives that the process of love has three components encompassed in the \"Triangle of Loving\". This is a model similar to the \"Triangle of Fire\" which describes three actions: fuel, combustion, activation energy. From the logic of fire, the three components of the act of love are created. * Subjectivize: the sender reflects and investigates what is good for the receiver, according to his internal world. * Intentional: the sender with intention gives something good, there is a meaning to his actions. * Feedback: the sender makes sure that for the receiver what he gave is something good. == References == Category:Psychology",
