 "text": "The Battle of Khe Sanh was a battle of the Vietnam War during the Tet Offensive. It was fought from 21 January to 9 July 1968. Khe Sanh was an important target for the communist Vietnamese soldiers to attack because it was a city near the border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, and there was an American-South Vietnamese military base nearby. The United States and the South Vietnamese Armies fought off communist soldiers in most of the battle zones for two months, but the Battle of Khe Sanh lasted much longer. It was one of the longest and deadliest battles in the entire war. Khe Sanh Khe Sanh Category:1968 in Asia",
