 "text": "The Division of Moreton is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first election in 1901. It is named after Moreton Bay, though changes to the boundaries over the years mean it is no longer near the bay. The seat decided the 1961 federal election. The Liberals won the seat by only 130 votes to have a one-seat majority in Parliament. ==Boundaries== Moreton is located in south east Queensland, and is based in the southern suburbs of the City of Brisbane.
