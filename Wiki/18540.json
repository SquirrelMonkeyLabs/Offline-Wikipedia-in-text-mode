Three organizations give Emmy Awards: * The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences gives the award for American prime time entertainment (not including sports). * The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences gives the award for daytime, sports, news, and documentary programming. * The International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences gives the award for programming that is created outside the United States. The best- known of the awards are the Primetime Awards (some of which are named \"Creative Arts Emmys\") and the Daytime Emmy Awards. The Emmy Awards is a statuette of a woman with wings holding an atom. It was created by television engineer Louis McManus, using his wife as a model.
