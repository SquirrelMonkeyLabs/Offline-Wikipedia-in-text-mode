Not much is known about his life. Guérin notes that church records about Monitor are very rare, making his existence uncertain. The story says his body was buried in the Church of Saint-Laurent in Orleans, along with other saints. In 1029, King Robert I of France had Monitor's remains moved during a special church event. == References == Category:Christian saints Category:French Roman Catholic bishops",
