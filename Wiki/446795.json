 "text": "This is the title history of the WWE Championship. The title was introduced in 1963 by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). It is recognized as the top championship in WWE. The wrestler with the most reigns as WWE champion is John Cena with 13. Ric Flair and John Cena hold the most world championship reigns recognized by WWE, across multiple companies, tied with 16. The longest reigning champion is Bruno Sammartino, holding the championship for 7 years, 8 months, and 1 day from May 17, 1963, to January 18, 1971. The current champion is John Cena, who is in his record 14th reign as champion. == Title History == As of , :† means that the title change was not recognized by WWE. # Wrestlers Reign Date Days held Location Event Notes Ref 1 Buddy Rogers 1 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil N/A Rogers won a fictional tournament in Rio de Janeiro after the WWWF left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Rogers had been the 7th NWA World Heavyweight Champion since defeating Pat O'Connor on June 30, 1961. After Rogers' one fall loss to Lou Thesz for the title on January 24, 1963, Northeast promoters (led by Vince McMahon Sr. and Toots Mondt) did not recognize this title change and ended their membership from the NWA to form the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The WWWF called Rogers as their world champion since January 25, 1963, but it did not recognize him as the first ever WWWF World Heavyweight Champion until April 11, 1963, when he got the title belt. However, WWE lists Rogers' reign and the cration of the title beginning on April 25, 1963. 2 Bruno Sammartino 1 New York, NY House show Bruno Sammartino faced off against the hated Buddy Rogers at Madison Square Garden. Sammartino used a dropkick, backbreaker and a crushing bear hug to become the champ. Sammartino would go on to defend his WWWF Championship for nearly eight years, which is a record that still stands today. 3 Ivan Koloff 1 Managed by Captain Lou Albano, the \"Russian Bear\" Ivan Koloff got a shot at Bruno Sammartino's WWWF Championship at Madison Square Garden, the same place that Sammartino won the title almost eight years before. Both Superstars were masters of the bear hug, but it was a knee drop from the top rope that gave Koloff the win. Although Koloff dethroned a champion that had held the title for nearly eight years, he would not be so lucky. Koloff's reign only lasted about three weeks. 4 Pedro Morales 1 The title was renamed WWWF Heavyweight Championship after WWWF rejoined the NWA in 1971. 5 Stan Stasiak 1 Philadelphia, PA Morales delivered a back suplex to Stasiak that went right into a pinning combination. Stasiak was able to get his arm up, while both of Morales' shoulders were on the mat. When the ref counted three, much to Morales' dismay, Stasiak's title reign began. 6 Bruno Sammartino 2 New York, NY 7 Billy Graham 1 Baltimore, MD |} 8 Bob Backlund 1 ()† New York, NY Billy Graham, who was traditionally a rule breaker, had the rules broken on him for a change. Backlund had Graham in a pinned, but Graham got his foot on the ropes. The referee was out of position to see the champ's foot, though, and his hand hit the mat for the three count giving Backlund his first WWF Championship. The title was renamed the WWF Heavyweight Championship after the World Wide Wrestling Federation became the World Wrestling Federation in March 1979. — Antonio Inoki 1† Tokushima, Japan His reign is not recognized by WWE Vacated† — — Inoki vacated the title after a rematch with Backlund ended in a no contest. Bob Backlund 2† New York, NY Backlund defeated Bobby Duncum in a Texas Death match. During this reign a controversial ending to a match between Backlund and Greg Valentine took place on 10/19/81 at Madison Square Garden, where the dazed referee raised Valentine's arm in victory, thinking that it was Backlund, after the champion had scored the pinfall. A rematch was held at MSG on 11/23/81 with Backlund defeating Valentine. Backlund defended the belt in other arenas between the two matches taking place, indicating that he was still the recognized champion. 9 The Iron Sheik 1 New York, NY The Iron Sheik won by forfeit after Backlund's manager Arnold Skaaland threw in the towel on his behalf to prevent any major injury as a result of Sheik's signature move \"The Camel Clutch\", but Backlund never officially submitted. 10 Hulk Hogan 1 Hogan overpowered The Iron Sheik and hit the big leg drop for his first WWF Championship. 11 André the Giant 1 59 Minutes Indianapolis, IN The Main Event I During the match, Andre went for the pin, but Hogan got his shoulder up at the count of one. The referee continued to count, however, and awarded the match to Andre. It was also revealed that Earl Hebner, who was said to have been refereeing the match, wasn't even in the ring. Instead, Ted DiBiase paid for another referee to have plastic surgery to look like Hebner so that he could guarantee Andre would win the WWF Championship. This is the shortest reign in the championship's history. — Vacated — — Indianapolis, IN The Main Event I Right after he won the title from Hogan, André sold it to DiBiase; President Jack Tunney nullified this decision, and he vacated the title. 12 Randy Savage 1 Atlantic City, NJ WrestleMania IV During the match, André went after Savage, which distracted the referee. This gave Hulk Hogan the opportunity to hit DiBiase with a chair, which then set up the flying elbow drop from Savage.
