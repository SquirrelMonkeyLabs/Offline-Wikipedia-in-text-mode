 "text": "The Battle of Cedar Mountain, also called Slaughter's Mountain or Cedar Run, was a battle that was fought on August 9, 1862, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the American Civil War. Soldiers in the Union Army forces attacked Confederate soldiers near Cedar Mountain as the Confederate Army reached Culpeper Court House to stop the Union Army from attacking central Virginia. After almost leaving the field in the early part of the battle, the Confederate Army launched a counterattack that broke the Union Army's lines, and the Confederate Army won. The battle was the first battle of the Northern Virginia campaign. ==References== == Other websites == * Battle of Cedar Mountain in Encyclopedia Virginia * The Battle of Cedar Mountain : Battle maps, photos, and preservation news (Civil War Trust) * Friends of Cedar Mountain Battlefield: Local group helping to manage a Civil War Trust property Category:American Civil War battles Category:1862 in Virginia",
