 "text": "The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty bans all tests of Nuclear weapons except for tests done underground. It was first meant to ban all tests, but it was changed because of Soviet concerns over methods of detecting underground nuclear tests. The reason for this treaty is because of public fear over the amount of nuclear testing and the fallout that would occur. The treaty was also meant to slow the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.
