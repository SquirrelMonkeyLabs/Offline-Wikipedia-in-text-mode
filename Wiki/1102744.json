 "text": "FTR (often stylized as #FTR; standing for Fuck The Rest) is a professional wrestling tag team of Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood, who are signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where they are former two-time AEW World Tag Team Champions. They are also known for their time in WWE as The Revival, under the ring names Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson, respectively. In WWE, The Revival have been two-time Raw Tag Team Champions, one-time SmackDown Tag Team Champions, two-time NXT Tag Team Champions, and one-time 24/7 Champions. They have also wrestled for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW), Ring of Honor (ROH). In those promotions, they have been one-time AAA World Tag Team Champions, one-time IWGP Tag Team Champions, and one-time ROH World Tag Team Champions. The team uses the phrase \"No flips, just fists\" and a rather traditional, mat based in-ring style than the more high flying style of other AEW teams. == Career == === WWE (2014–2020) === In 2014 Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson formed a tag team, known as \"The Mechanics\" and later \"Dash and Dawson\". On October 22, 2015, they won the NXT Tag Team Championship from The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch). In 2016 they were renamed \"The Revival\". At NXT TakeOver: Dallas on April 1 they lost the title to American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan), but won it back from them on June 8 at NXT TakeOver: The End, becoming the first ever two-time NXT Tag Team Champions as a team. On November 19, 2016 at NXT TakeOver: Toronto, they lost the titles to #DIY (Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa). On the April 3, 2017 episode of Raw, The Revival made their debut on WWE's main roster with a victory over The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods). On the February 11, 2019 edition of Raw, Dawson and Wilder won the Raw Tag Team Championship for the first time from Bobby Roode and Chad Gable. They dropped the title to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder at WrestleMania 35 on April 7, this also broke Hawkins' long losing streak. On June 10, The Revival won the titles back but lost them to The O.C. (Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows) on the July 29 edition of Raw. On August 12, 2019 both members of The Revival pinned R-Truth at the same time to become the only co-champions of the 24/7 Championship. Moments later, R-Truth pinned Dawson, with the help of Carmella, and regained the title. At Clash of Champions on September 15, The Revival won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship from The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods). On the November 8 edition of SmackDown, they lost the titles to The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston). On April 10, 2020, Dawson and Wilder were both released from WWE. During an interview in November 2020, both Harwood and Wheeler said that they were offered a lot of money to stay with WWE. However, they wanted to join AEW because they were tired of being taken off of the main roster cards. Wheeler would say in the interview: \"Once we got pulled from all of our dates on the main roster, it was down to NXT as the option and we talked to Hunter at length, there were offers on the table that were very tempting because we loved NXT and we loved our time there, but at the end of the day like Dax said, we knew that our time there was done.\" === All Elite Wrestling (2020–present) === On the May 27, 2020 at Dynamite, Harwood and Wheeler, under the team name FTR made their debut with All Elite Wrestling (AEW). They drove into the amphitheater in a pickup truck, entered the ring and attacked The Butcher and The Blade. On the June 10 episode of Dynamite, they had their first official in-ring match in AEW. They defeated The Butcher and The Blade. On the August 22 episode of Dynamite Tully Blanchard was introduced as FTR's Manager. At All Out on September 5 Harwood and Wheeler won the AEW World Tag Team Championship from Adam Page and Kenny Omega. This made them the first team to become tag team champions in WWE and AEW. On November 7 at Full Gear they lost the titles to The Young Bucks. On October 6, 2021, FTR defeated the Lucha Brothers (Pentagón Jr. and Fénix) to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship.
