 "text": "The lar gibbon (Hylobates lar) is also known as the white-handed gibbon. It is a primate in the Hylobatidae or gibbon family. It is one of the better-known gibbons. It is often seen in zoos. The fur coloring of the lar gibbon is not fixed. It can range from black and dark-brown to light brown sandy colors. Lar gibbons are diurnal (they are active during the day). They are arboreal, living in rainforests. Family groups live in a firm territory. They protect it from other gibbons by their calls. In the wild, lar gibbons live about 25 years. ==References== ==Other websites== *Lar Gibbon photos *Lar Gibbon songs *Gibbon Conservation Center *Lar Gibbon at Animal Diversity Web *Thomas Geissmann's Gibbon Research Lab and Gibbon Network * Category:Old World monkeys Category:Mammals of Asia",
