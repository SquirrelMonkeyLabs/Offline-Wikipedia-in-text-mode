 "text": "The Proclamation of the Republic of China is when the Republic of China was officially created at midnight on January 1, 1912, by Sun Yat-sen, leader of the Nationalist Party of China. He gave a speech to the people that day. This happened after the Xinhai Revolution on October 10, 1911, and the fall of the Qing Dynasty. == Xinhai Revolution == On October 10, 1911, after the Wuchang Uprising, the Qing Dynasty lost control of the provinces to the revolutionary forces of the Tongmenghui. The Tongmenghui was started in 1905 when several smaller secret groups joined together. Its main leaders were Sun Yat-sen, with help from Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, and Homer Lea. When the revolt started, Sun Yat-sen was in the United States. He sent Huang Xing to be the commander of the Tongmenghui's army to work with Li Yuanhong, the leader of the revolt. By November 1911, most of the Tongmenghui members were already in China, which was controlled by the revolutionaries. They planned to create a temporary government in Nanjing. Nanjing was captured on December 2, 1911, and was important to the revolutionaries because it had been the capital of China's main dynasties before the Qing. == 1911 Presidential Election == For the first time in Chinese history, elections were held later that year to choose a leader for the government and the country, after the capture of Nanjing. On December 29, Lin Sen, who was the head of the national assembly, organized and counted the election. The result showed that 94.11% of the votes went to Sun Yat-sen, who was chosen as the provisional President of China. Li Yuanhong got 100% of the votes and was chosen as the provisional vice president. Huang Xing, who got 5.88% of the vote for president and 0% for vice president, was made Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Minister of Defense by Sun Yat-sen. == Proclamation == On January 1, 1912, after the presidential elections in Nanjing were finished and the government was set up, Sun Yat-sen officially started the Republic of China with this declaration to the Chinese people: > 中华民国缔造之始，而文以不德，膺临时大总统之任，夙夜戒惧， 虑无以副国民之望。夫中 > 国专制政治之毒，至二百年来而滋甚，一旦以国民之力踣而去之，起事不过数旬，光复已十余 行省，自有历史以来，成功未有如是之速也。 > 国民以为于内无统一之机关，于外无对待之主 体，建设之事更不容缓，于是以组织临时政府之责相属。自推功让能之观念以言，文所不敢任 也；自服务尽责之观念以 > 言，则文所不敢辞也。是用黾勉从国民之后，能尽扫专制之流毒， 确定共和以达革命之宗旨，完国民之志愿，端在今日。敢披沥肝胆为国民告：国家之本在于人 民， > 合汉、满、蒙、回、藏诸地为一国，即合汉、满、蒙、回、藏诸族为一人，是曰民族之 统一。 (In Simple English:) \"Since the > founding of the Republic of China, I, Wen, have reluctantly taken the role > of Provisional Secretary and President. We have stayed alert day and night, > always ready to help our citizens. The problem of Chinese authoritarianism > has been strong for the past two centuries, but now our people are working > hard to get rid of it. In just a few weeks, we have already taken control of > about ten provinces. Never in history has so much been done so quickly. Some > people think that since there is no united national organization or outside > group to handle these issues, it is even more important to set up a > government without delay.

Only after I have worked > hard to help the people remove authoritarianism, ensure the republic follows > the principles of the revolution, and meet the wishes of our citizens, will > I step down. I tell the people that the strength of the nation comes from > the people. The land of the Han, Manchu, Mongols, Muslims, and Tibetans is > one country; and so, the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Muslim, and Tibetan people are > one nation. This is a united race.\" == References == Category:History of China Category:History of Taiwan",
