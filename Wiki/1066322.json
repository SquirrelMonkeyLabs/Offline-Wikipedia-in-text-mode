 "text": "Pseudophilautus mooreorum is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in the Knuckles Hills between 1100 and 1245 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 29.4 – 31.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 33.8 – 35.0 mm long. The frog's head is a bright green color that looks like it is glowing. The sides of the body are yellow and white in color. Parts of the mouth are white in color. The tops of the back legs are green in color, and parts of the tops of the back legs are white in color. The toes of all four feet are white in color. This frog has disks on its toes for climbing. They are white in color. This frog lives on shrubs: Woody plants that are smaller than trees. Scientists have seen the male frogs sitting in the shrubs 1 - 3 meters above the ground. They live in cloud forests where the branches of the large trees come together like a roof. The shrubs that the frogs climb on make the understory: The layer of shorter plants under the large trees. Like other frogs in Pseudophilautus, they grow through direct development: They hatch out of eggs as small frogs. They never swim as tadpoles. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
