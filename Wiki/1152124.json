 "text": "The Expedition for the Procurement of State Papers was established to print official documents, including banknotes, postage stamps, passports, and securities, during the Ukrainian People's Republic's struggle for independence. Its operations were vital for sustaining the state's financial and administrative systems during turbulent times of war and political instability. == Historical background == # Establishment and purpose: The institution was founded in 1918 to centralize the production of essential state materials. Early operations were based in Kyiv, using advanced printing facilities, such as the Vasyl Kulzhenko printing house, which initially printed 100-karbovanets notes. # Role during the UNR period: The expedition continued its work during the Directorate period, often relocating due to military conflicts. For example, in 1920, during the Soviet invasion, its facilities were moved from Kamianets-Podilskyi to Tarn√≥w in Poland to safeguard equipment and archives. # Closure and Legacy: The expedition ceased operations in 1921 following the decline of the UNR. Some archival materials were preserved but later destroyed during the Soviet era in 1952. Despite its short lifespan, the expedition contributed significantly to the development of Ukraine's financial independence during its national liberation struggle. == Key contributions == * The first Ukrainian banknotes and postal stamps, featuring national symbols like the trident, were printed by this institution. These designs symbolized Ukraine's independence and cultural identity. * It served as an example of state-building efforts in a period marked by war and political upheaval, reflecting the ambitions of the UNR government.
