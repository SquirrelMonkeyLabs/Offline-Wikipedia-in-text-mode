An ambulance truck was dispatched to save and rescue poor Hind, but the truck was shot by the tank, and everyone inside the truck was killed. At some point, most likely on the same day her family was shot dead, poor Hind Rajab, who temporarily survived for several hours or even a day by hiding in the rubble of what was left from her family's damaged car, was unfortunately discovered when she was picked up from the rubble and shot dead by Israeli soldiers, shortly after her family's deaths. Hind Rajab was later recognized and considered as one of the most notable and high- profilic victims of the Hamas war between Israel and Palestine and the Gaza genocide, and her death shook the crippled Palestine, was a famous example of war crimes, and caused a lot of war outcry and protests. Palestinian army officials later discovered the bodies of a Palestinian family and members of a ambulance truck who were all shot dead by the Israelis on . They were positively identified as belonging to five-year-old Hind Rajab, her family, and members of the ambulance truck that came to save and rescue Hind.
