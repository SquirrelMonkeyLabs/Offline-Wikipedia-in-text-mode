 "text": "Tamara Natalie Madden (August 16, 1975 – November 4, 2017) was a Jamaican-born American painter and mixed-media artist working. Madden's paintings are allegories whose subjects are the people of the African diaspora. After her solo exhibition in 2004, Madden relocated near Atlanta, Georgia. She was born in Kingston, Jamaica. She studied at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Her first solo exhibition was in 2004, and it got her an interview with the late James Auer of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. In 2007, Madden debuted a series entitled, \"Kings & Queens\", which focused on heightening the everyday person. Her work continues to focus on recognizing nobility, honor and respect in those often overlooked by society. Madden died of ovarian cancer on November 4, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia at the age of 42. ==References== Category:1975 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from ovarian cancer Category:Cancer deaths in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Jamaican people Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:American painters Category:People from Atlanta Category:People from Milwaukee",
