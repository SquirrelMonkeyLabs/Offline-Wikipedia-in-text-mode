Except Brunei, each of these countries occupies part of the islands. The territory of the Republic of China is claimed in whole by the People's Republic of China.In 1949, the Republic of China government led by the Kuomintang (KMT) lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China (CPC) and set up a provisional capital in Taipei. The CPC established the PRC. The political status of the ROC and the legal status of Taiwan and areas currently under ROC control are in dispute. In 1971, the United Nations gave the China seat to the PRC and the ROC withdrew from the UN. Most states recognize the PRC to be the legitimate representative of all China.
