 "text": "Freightliner Trucks is a truck brand of Daimler AG, which owns the premium automobile brand of Mercedes Benz. Freightliners are manufactured in the United States, Canada and Mexico. == History == Freightliner began in 1929 as the truck-manufacturing division of Consolidated Freightways in Portland, Oregon. In line with the company name, during the 1930s, Freightways Manufacturing began to brand its truck production under the \"Freightliner\" name. In addition to their shorter length, the trucks underwent weight reduction to maximize use of engine power (needed to climb mountains in the western United States). In 1942 Leland James renamed it Freightliner Corporation. As part of the launch, the company made the first truck with an all-aluminium cab. Shifting to military production during World War II, Freightliner resumed truck production in 1947. In 1949, Freightliner sold its first vehicle outside of CF (to Portland-based forklift manufacturer Hyster. The vehicle is preserved in the Smithsonian collection in Washington, D.C. ==Models== Freightliner Class 8 Trucks Model Family Name Production Years Cab Configuration Notes WFT (White-Freightliner) 1958-1976 Cabover/COE *WFC (White-Freightliner) **WFC 120 1974-1976 Conventional First White-Freightliner conventional 120-inch BBC *FLA-Series ** FLA ** FLA 104 ** FLA 104 64 ** FLA 75 ** FLA 7542T ** FLA 8662 ** FLA 8664T ** FLA 9664 ** FLA 9664T c.1987-1997 Cabover/COE *FLB-Series ** FLB ** FLB 100 42T ** FLB 104 64 ** FLB 9664 c.1987-1997 Cabover/COE *FLT-Series ** FLT ** FLT 6442 ** FLT 9664 ** FLT 7564 1976-1986 Cabover/COE Largely the same as WFT COE, renamed to reflect the discontinuation of White Motor Company distribution.
