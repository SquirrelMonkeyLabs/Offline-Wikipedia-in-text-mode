The biting ones are often called midges. Often they fly in large numbers, called clouds, in damp places like the Scottish Highlands. One interesting group are the eye-gnats. the Smithsonian Institution describes them as “non-biting flies, no bigger than a few grains of salt, ... attracted to fluids secreted by your eyes”. == References == Category:Flies",
