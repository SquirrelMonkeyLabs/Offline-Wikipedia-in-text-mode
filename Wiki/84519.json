 "text": "Modest Mouse is an indie rock band from Issaquah, Washington. It was formed by Isaac Brock, Jeremiah Green, and Eric Judy. They started making music in 1993. == History == They formed in the state of Washington, during the popularity of grunge music. They struggled to release an album, but eventually released their first album This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About in 1996 after being signed to Up Records. Their second album, The Lonesome Crowded West, came next, one year later. They then re-signed to Epic Records in 2000 and released The Moon & Antarctica. In 2003, Jeremiah Green left the band, but he was replaced with Benjamin Weikel and Dann Gallucci. Modest Mouse was fairly unaffected by this, and they released their fourth album, Good News for People Who Love Bad News one year later. It was very popular and had two main hits: \"Float On\" and \"Ocean Breathes Salty.\" In 2006, after a long tour supporting Good News, Modest Mouse came back to the studio to record their fifth studio album, We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank. It was fairly quick to record, and it was released on March 20, 2007. It was even more popular than Good News. A hit single from this album was \"Dashboard.\" After touring for over a year with R.E.M. and The National, Modest Mouse released a collection of songs not released on Good News or We Were Dead known as No One's First and You're Next. It was released in 2009. == List of albums == === Studio albums === Year Title Other information Label 1996 This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About Up Records 1997 The Lonesome Crowded West Up Records 2000 The Moon & Antarctica Reissue in 2004.
