 "text": "Min Yoon-gi (; born March 9, 1993), better known by his stage names Suga and Agust D, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is also a member of the group BTS. == Life == Min Yoon-ki was born on March 9, 1993 in Daegu, South Korea. His mother dreamed of a pumpkin coming through a window and spent her childhood in Daegu to Taejeon Elementary School and Gwaneum Middle School in Daegu. Suga started writing music lyrics at age 13 and learned about MIDI. Suga worked part-time at a record studio until he was 17. In 2010, during his second year of high school, he proudly passed the first national audition for HIT IT, which recruited a new member of BTS from Big Hit Entertainment, and transferred to Apgujeong High School and moved to Seoul. It is said that the reason for joining Big Hit was that he applied for both the composer and rapper auditions and passed in the summer of 2010. In the early days of joining the company, he dreamed of becoming a rapper while focusing on production rather than becoming an idol. Prior to joining Big Hit, Suga was an underground rapper under the name Gloss. Although he wanted to be a songwriter, Bang Si-hyuk wanted to raise him as an idol, and Bang persuaded him that he only needed to rap without choreography, like the hip-hop group One Time, so he eventually became a member of BTS. In 2016, he released his first solo mixtape, August D. == Name == The stage name Suga () comes from the first syllables of the term shooting guard (). It is the position he played in basketball as a student. He adopted the alias Agust D in 2016 for his mixtape. It was from his initials DT. In short for his birthplace, Daegu Town, and \"Suga\" spelled backwards. == Career == Suga is responsible for writing, composing, arranging, mixing, and mastering his materials. Over 70 registered songs are credited to him by the Korea Music Copyright Association. He is a pianist, and produces hip hop and R&B; music. His lyrics involve themes that are \"full of dreams and hope,\" conceived with the intent of his music becoming \"many people's strength.\" He cites Stony Skunk and Epik High as his inspirations to pursue hip hop music. Particularly, he credits the former's reggae-hiphop hybrid album Ragga Muffin (2005) and its title track for igniting his interest in the genre. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse said that Suga's mixtape \"showcases the star's ear for hot productions, hardcore rap style, and how he can make his vulnerabilities a strength.\" Other critics stated that Suga's \"storytelling execution in the music he creates tears down the barrier of censoring and sugarcoating\". In January 2018, Suga was promoted to a full member of the Korea Music Copyright Association. == References == == Other websites == * Category:1993 births Category:BTS members Category:Hybe Corporation artists Category:K-pop singers Category:Living people Category:South Korean record producers Category:South Korean rappers Category:South Korean singer-songwriters",
