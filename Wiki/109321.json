The small town was built by Robert Owen as an experiment in utopian idealism. Between 1785 and 1968, some buildings were torn down or burned; and some new buildings were built. However, the overall appearance of the village stayed much like it was in the first half of the 19th century. In 1975, the New Lanark Conservation Trust was established to prevent demolition of the village.Shadows of our Ancestors, \"New Lanark\" ; retrieved 2012-4-21. In 2001, New Lanark was named a World Heritage Site. ==Gallery== File:As it once was - geograph.org.uk - 111939.jpg|Mill buildings needing repair, 1980 File:NewlanarkNL07.jpg|Mill building is in bad shape, 1983 ==Related pages== * List of World Heritage Sites of the United Kingdom ==References== ==Other websites== * New Lanark website Category:Villages in South Lanarkshire Category:World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom",
