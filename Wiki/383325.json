The player can swipe the touch screen to use the Kirbys as projectile weapons. To get Kirbys, the player has to collect fruit seen in levels. Each level requires a certain number of Kirbys to enter. In some levels, there are puzzles where you need all 10 Kirbys to solve them. ==References== Category:2011 video games Category:Kirby Category:HAL Laboratory games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U",
