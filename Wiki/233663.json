 "text": "In sports, an All-America \"team\" is a group of amateur athletes who are honored for being the best in the sport. The players who are on these teams are usually selected by members of the media or companies who sponsor the team. In other cases, players become an All-American by achieving a standard such as placing in the top 40 of the NCAA cross country race. Sometimes these teams play in games against other All-American teams, but most All-American teams never actually compete in events.
