 "text": "The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface specification. It is used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. SPI devices communicate in full duplex mode using a master-slave architecture. The master (controller) device originates the frame for reading and writing. The SPI may be accurately described as a synchronous serial interface. But it is different from the Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) protocol. == Developer == The interface was developed by Motorola in the mid-1980s. Later it has become a de facto standard. == Pros and cons == === Advantages === * Full duplex communication in the default version of this protocol * Push-pull drivers (as opposed to open drain) provide good signal integrity and high speed * Higher throughput than I²C or SMBus. Not limited to any maximum clock speed, enabling potentially high speed * Complete protocol flexibility for the bits transferred ** Not limited to 8-bit words ** Arbitrary choice of message size, content, and purpose * Simple software implementation === Disadvantages === * Requires more pins on IC packages than I²C, even in the three-wire variant * No in-band addressing; out-of-band chip select signals are required on shared buses * SPI does not support hot swapping (dynamically adding nodes) * Some variants like dual SPI, quad SPI, and three-wire serial buses defined below are half-duplex. == Applications == * Memory: SD Card , MMC , EEPROM , Flash. * Sensors: Temperature and Pressure. * Control Devices: ADC , DAC , digital POTS and Audio Codec. * Others: Camera Lens Mount, touchscreen, LCD, RTC, video game controller, etc. == Sources == == Other websites == * Intel eSPI (Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface) * SPI Tutorial Category:Computer buses",
