The scale pattern consists of medial dark brown blotches, alternating with lateral rows of spots. It occurs along the southern slopes of the Himalayas from Kashmir to Nepal as far as Sikkim between 1500â€“3000 m altitude. The Himalayan Pit Viper is a habitually sluggish snake that basks in sunlight and hibernates in winter. ==Sources== Category:Reptiles of Pakistan Category:Vipers Category:Snakes of Asia",
