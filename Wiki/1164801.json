 "text": "A car door is a type of door opening for an automobile. Car doors are designed to help people enter and exit cars. The doors usually hang from hinges connected to the car body on their front edge. Sometimes car doors are connected in other ways. These connections can be tracks. Car doors mostly have windows on them so people can see inside and outside of the car. The doors can also be locked to keep the inside of the vehicle safe. == Parts == * Door card * Door handle * Door switch * Glass window * Pillar * Power door locks, which can work on a remote system * Interior storage compartment == Names given for number and type of doors == Hatchback and estate or station wagon vehicles usually called \"three-door\" or \"five-door\" cars in Europe and some other parts of the world. For saloons or sedans and coup√©s, the boot/trunk lid is not a door. This is because the lid is for opening into a different part of the car. Passenger cars will typically have two-doors (such as coupes) or four-doors (such as sedans). == References == Category:Automobiles",
