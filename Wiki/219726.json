 "text": "Florence and the Machine (also written as Florence + the Machine), is an English rock band that is a recording name of Florence Welch and a collaboration of other artists who provide backing music for her voice. Musically, Florence and the Machine's sound is generally referred to as soul- inspired indie rock. Florence and the Machine's music has received praise across the music media, especially from the BBC. This is because the BBC played a large part in Florence and the Machine's rise to prominence by promoting her as part of BBC Introducing. This led to the band playing at a number of music festivals in 2008, including Glastonbury as well as Reading and Leeds and T in the Park. The band's debut album, Lungs was released on 6 July 2009. It held the number 2 position for its first five weeks in the charts, behind Michael Jackson. The album has now been in the top 40 UK charts for 22 consecutive weeks. == The Machine == Welch said that \"The name Florence and the Machine started off as a private joke that got out of hand. I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought \"Okay, I'll be Florence Robot is a Machine\", before realizing that name was so long it'd drive me mad\".A piece of my mind ... Sunday Herald 25 July, 2009 In 2006 Welch's performances in small London venues as \"Florence Robot is a Machine\" began to attract notice. The Machine is Florence's backing band. This is currently made up of Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Christopher Lloyd Hayden (drums), Isabella Summers ('Isabella Machine') (keyboards) and Tom Monger (harp).\"Dog Days Are Over\" CD single Previously Devonte Hynes (Lightspeed Champion and Test Icicles) was also a member. Florence and the Machine are managed by Mairead Nash. Nash is one half of the DJ outfit Queens of Noize. == Touring == Florence and the Machine were part of the 2009 Shockwaves NME Awards tour. Welch said that she planned a \"pretty theatrical\" performance. The group played at the Concerts for the Teenage Cancer Trust charity event at the Royal Albert Hall in March 2009. Florence and The Machine also supported Blur for their 26 June comeback performance at the MEN Arena in Manchester, and supported Duran Duran in July 2009. The group performed at the 2009 Glastonbury Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Electric Picnic in County Laois, Ireland and the T in the Park festival. On October 27 the group played its first official New York City show and appeared on the television programmes Late Night With David Letterman and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Welch has said that she would like to tour the United States. However, she is fearful of becoming homesick due to the length of time it would take to tour the country. On New Year's Eve 2009, the group appeared on the pre-recorded New Year's Eve celebration show Hootenanny. On the show, they performed \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" and \"Dog Days Are Over\". Welch then performed a cover of \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" with Jools Holland & his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra. == Critical acclaim == Florence and the Machine have gained a large amount of support from NME magazine who included them in their annual NME Awards Tour for 2009. They supported White Lies, Friendly Fires and Glasvegas on the tour. The Times described her as \"the most peculiar and most highly acclaimed female singer of the moment\" and \"the latest in a line of great English pop eccentrics\". Allmusic described Lungs as \"one of the most musically mature and emotionally mesmerizing albums of 2009\".Spin Magazine gave Lungs four out of five possible stars and wrote, \"You’ve gotta hand it to the girl: She always makes you feel something\". The magazine named the album as the 8th best of 2009. Welch appeared on the front cover of The Guide subsection to The Guardian. She also collected the Critics' Choice Award at the BRIT Awards in February 2009. Florence and the Machine came third in the BBC's Sound of 2009. In 2009 she covered Beyoncé's song \"Halo\" on the BBC1 Live Lounge; host Jo Whiley stated that it was one of the best covers they have ever had in the Live Lounge. The BBC also used \"You Got The Love\" as the backing music to its Jenson Button Formula One 2009 season review video montage and it was used in the final episode of Gavin and Stacey. == Awards == ===Brit Awards=== Year Nominated work Award Result 2009 Florence and the Machine Critics' Choice 2010 Florence and the Machine British Female Solo Artist 2010 British Breakthrough Act 2010 Lungs MasterCard British Album of the Year 2011 \"You've Got the Love\" British Single 2012 Florence and the Machine British Female Solo Artist 2012 Ceremonials MasterCard British Album of the Year ===Grammy Awards=== Year Nominated work Award 2011 Florence and the Machine Best New Artist ===MTV=== ====MTV Europe Music Awards==== Year Nominated work Award Result 2009 Florence and the Machine Best UK and Ireland New Act ====MTV Video Music Awards==== Year Nominated work Award Result 2010 \"Dog Days Are Over\" Video of the Year Best RockVideo Best Art Direction in a Video Best Cinematography in a Video ===Other awards=== Year Organisation Nominated work Award Result 2009 BBC Sound of 2009 Florence and the Machine Sound of 2009 Third place Mercury Prize Lungs Mercury Prize Studio8 Media International Music Award Florence and the Machine Female Voice of July 2009 \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" Song of July 2009 Q Awards Lungs Best Album \"Drumming Song\" Best Video Florence and the Machine Breakthrough Artist UK Festival Awards Best Breakthrough Act \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" Anthem of the Year Florence and the Machine Festival Fitty of the Year – Girls UK Music Video Awards \"Drumming Song\" Best Pop Video Best Styling in a Video \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" 2010 South Bank Show Florence and the Machine South Bank Show Award Glamour Women of the Year Awards Florence and the Machine Band of the Year Meteor Music Awards Lungs Best International Album Florence and the Machine Best International Band Best International Live Performance Elle Style Awards Musician of the Year Shockwaves NME Awards Best Solo Artist \"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\" Best Track \"You've Got the Love\" Best Dancefloor Filler Florence Welch Best Dressed MOJO Awards Florence and the Machine Breakthrough Act Best Live Act \"You've Got the Love\" Song of the Year Lungs Best Album BT Digital Music Awards Florence and the Machine Best Female Artist \"You've Got the Love\" Best Song Q Awards Florence and the Machine Best Female \"You've Got the Love\" Best Song UK Music Video Awards \"Dog Days Are Over\" Best Pop Video Best Styling in a Video UK Festival Awards \"You've Got the Love\" Anthem of the Year Florence and the Machine Feel-Good Act of the Summer 4Music Video Honours \"Dog Days Are Over\" Best Video of 2010 European Festival Awards \"You've Got the Love\" Anthem of the Year Florence and the Machine Best Newcomer 2011 Virgin Media Music Awards Hottest Women Florence and the Machine with Dizzee Rascal Best Collaboration \"Dog Days Are Over\" Best Video Florence Welch Best Live Act Shameless Publicity Seeker Shockwaves NME Awards Florence and the Machine Best Solo Artist International Dance Music Awards \"Dog Days Are Over\" (Yeasayer Remix) Best Alternative/Rock Dance Track Florence and the Machine Best Break-Through Artist (Group) Glamour Women of the Year Awards Best Band Billboard Music Awards \"Dog Days Are Over\" Top Rock Song Top Alternative Song 2012 Elle Style Awards Florence and the Machine Best Music Act Shockwaves NME Awards Florence and the Machine Best Solo Artist \"Shake It Out\" Best Track Florence and the Machine Hottest Female ===UK festival Awards 2009=== **Anthem of Summer - Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) - Nominated **Best Breakthrough Act - Winner **Festival Fitty of the Year - Girls - Nominated *First in the 2009 BRITs Critics' Choice section. *Third in the BBCs Sound of 2009.
