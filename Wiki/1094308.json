 "text": "The Sorcerer’s Apprentice is a poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. It is about a person who is training as an apprentice to a Sorcerer. The Apprentice uses magic to make his brooms clean up for him but instead they cause even bigger problems and he has to fix it before the Sorcerer gets back. == Adaptations == In 1897, Paul Dukas made a classical music song based on the poem. In 1940, Walt Disney put a Sorcerer’s Apprentice Cartoon in Fantasia. In 2010, Jon Turteltaub made a movie called The Sorcerer’s Apprentice starring Jay Baruchel. It is very different from the poem.
