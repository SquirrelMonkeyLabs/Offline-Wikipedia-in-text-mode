 "text": "The legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are transgender, depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. Transgender and intersex individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the \"opposite\" sex or permitted to marry partners of the \"same\" sex due to legal distinctions. In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. \"Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality.\" Archives of Sexual Behavior 38.5 (October 2009): 688â€“701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009 In the United Kingdom, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. Support for same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world. ==References== Category:Same-sex marriage Category:LGBT marriages",
