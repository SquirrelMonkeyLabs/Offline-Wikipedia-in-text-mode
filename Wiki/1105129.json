 "text": "OTV (formally known as Oglinda TV) was a Romanian TV channel owned by Dan Diaconescu. It was best known for its talk show, Dan Diaconescu Direct. Although it had a large audience, the channel had very often been criticized for using too much sensationalism and tabloid journalism. On 22 January 2013, it was closed as its licence was retracted by the National Audiovisual Council of Romania for not having paid a large sum of money including fines received in the past years, and also for having repeatedly violated Romanian audiovisual laws. ==Other websites== * https://web.archive.org/web/20180517121206/http://www.oglinda.home.ro/ Category:Television channels in Romania",
