 "text": "In the United States, if someone under 21 years of age has or drinks alcohol, it's against the law. This law is called \"Minor in Possession\" or \"MIP\" and is usually a misdemeanor. If anyone under the age of 21 has or drinks alcohol, except in special cases, they are breaking the law. Punishments for people under 21 years of age caught with alcohol differ around the United States. Each state has its own rules for the drinking age and only local or state officials can give out tickets for underage drinking. Every state has different fines and consequences for minors caught with alcohol. ==References== Category:Legislation",
