 "text": "The Type 98 20 mm anti-aircraft machine cannon was a widely used light anti- aircraft gun employed by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It entered service in 1938 and was used extensively throughout the war. After World War II, it was utilized by the Indonesian Army during the Indonesian National Revolution and by North Vietnam during the First Indochina War. == Design and Use == The Type 98 20 mm AA machine cannon was notable for being the most common light anti-aircraft gun of the Japanese military. It was named \"Type 98\" as it was accepted in the year 2598 of the Japanese calendar, corresponding to 1938 in the Gregorian calendar. The cannon was introduced into service that same year and saw its first combat during the Nomonhan Incident. Approximately 80% of the Imperial Japanese Army's light anti- aircraft guns were Type 98s. The design was influenced by the French 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine gun of the 1930s, which the Japanese had purchased and modified. The Type 98 was known for its robustness, portability, and ease of deployment. It could be emplaced by an experienced crew in about three minutes and was also used in an anti-tank role. The gun could be fired from its wheels if needed, although this resulted in reduced accuracy. == References == Category:Artillery",
