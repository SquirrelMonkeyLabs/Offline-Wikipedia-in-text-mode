Blokker built \"Blokker Holding\" together with his brother Jaap Blokker, with a series of important acquisitions in the 1980s and 1990s, including Bart Smit (1985), Leen Bakker, Casa (1988), Xenos (1989), Intertoys, Marskramer (1993) and Maxi Toys (1997). After the death of Jaap Blokker in July 2011, Ab remained the sole active family shareholder the Blokker group. However, he could not prevent the further decline of the chain and clashed with the innovative director Roland Palmer, who had to resign in 2015. In 2017, Ab Blokker stepped down as a member of the Supervisory Board. In 2021 he sold his interest in decoration chain Casa International to the management and investment company Globitas. Blokker died on 15 January 2022, at the age of 76. ==References== Category:Dutch businesspeople Category:1945 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Place of death missing",
