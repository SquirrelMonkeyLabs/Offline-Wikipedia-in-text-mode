From the early 1960s, Terry- Thomas began appearing in American movies such as Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife. Although there were exceptions, Terry-Thomas's screen characters were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that \"although there would be variations, he would remain the 'rotter', a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life\".[98] Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, said it was \"always the same character and always funny\".[163] Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him \"the definitive postwar cad or rotter\".[125] Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that \"T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain ... bounder ... aristocratic rogue ... upper- class English twit ... genuine English eccentric ... one of the last real gentlemen ... wet, genteel Englishman ... high-bred idiot ... cheeky blighter ... camel-haired cad ... amiable buffoon ... pompous Englishman ... twentieth- century dandy ... stinker ... king of the cads ... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry-Thomas\" Among the cads that he plays: * Sir Percy Ware-Armitage in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines 1965 * Percy son Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage in Monte Carlo or Bust! 1969 * Captain Sir Harry Washington-Smythe in Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon 1967 In 1971, Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
