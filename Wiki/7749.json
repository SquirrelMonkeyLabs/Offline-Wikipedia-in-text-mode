 "text": "Nazism is a set of political beliefs associated with the Nazi Party of Germany. It started in the 1920s, but the Nazi Party took over Germany in 1933 and started carrying out their ideas in Germany, which they called the Third Reich. They stayed in power in Germany until 1945, when they lost World War II. ==Overview== Nazism is a form of fascism, a far-right ideology heavily inspired from the works of Oswald Spengler. The Nazis believed that only the Aryan (German) race was capable of building nations and other races, notably the Jewish race, were agents of the corruptive forces of capitalism and Marxism, both of which the Nazis opposed. They considered the Aryan race – or Aryans – the \"Master race\" (Übermensch), deeming the Aryans the most biologically advanced human beings. They applied Charles Darwin's theory of evolution to mankind, one of the practical application of which was the eugenics. ==Adolf Hitler== Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party, wanted to a create a country where all \"Aryans\" were treated equally. They spent heavily on poorer people and began several huge government programs to help Germany deal with the unemployment and economic crisis caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed it. Some Nazis, such as Ernst Röhm, wanted the reforms to go further and called for a revolution, eliminating economic classes in Germany and government takeover of major businesses. Many of them were murdered on Hitler's orders during the Night of the Long Knives as they were seen as a threat to his power. In a September 18, 1939 editorial, The New York Times reacted to the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by declaring that\"Editorial: The Russian Betrayal\". The New York Times. September 18, year 1939. The editorial further asserted, ==Antisemitism== The Nazis blamed the Jewish people for Germany's defeat in World War I. This is known as the Stab in the Back Myth. The Nazis also blamed the Jewish people for rapid inflation and practically every other economic woe facing Germany at the time as a result of their defeat in World War I. For this reason, the Nazis not only viewed Jews as inferior to them, but as oppressors of the Aryan people who were creating inequality. The Nazis' tactic of lazily albeit effectively blaming the Jewish people for all of Germany's problems is a propaganda tactic known as scapegoating and was used to justify the Holocaust. To implement the racist ideas, the Nuremberg Race Laws (1935) banned non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from serving the government. They also forbid any sexual contact between 'Aryan' and non-Aryan persons. The Nazis sent millions of Jews, Poles, Roma, Ukrainians, homosexuals, disabled people and political opponents to death camps to be killed. The genocide of 6,000,000+ European Jews is called the the Holocaust. The word Nazi is an abbreviation for Nationalsozialist – supporter of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei – in German. ==Nazi rise to power (1919-1934)== Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, wrote a book called Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). The book said that all of Germany's problems happened because Jews were making plans to hurt the country. He also said that Jewish and communist politicians planned the Armistice of 1918 that ended World War I, and allowed Germany to agree to pay huge amounts of money and goods (reparations). In November 1923, the Nazis tried to overthrow the democratic German government that had been set up after WWI. Nazi thinking emphasises conflict and violence, and believes that these are the best way to sort out political problems. The Nazis had therefore set up their own private army, called the Sturmabteilung (SA) which were sometimes known as the 'Nazi stormtroopers' or simply the 'brownshirts'. Many political parties had their own private armies at this time in Germany to guard their events and meetings from the private armies of other political parties. The attempt to take power is referred to as the Munich Putsch or Beer Hall Putsch and was crushed after less than 24 hours. After the Putsch, Hitler was imprisoned for six months and the Nazi Party briefly banned. It was allowed to exist again in if it promised to only be democratic. The Nazis agreed, but made it clear that if they took power in Germany, they would turn Germany into a dictatorship. The Nazis believed in something called the Führer Principle, which means that they believe that all groups should be organised like armies, with absolute loyalty shown to the leader of the group. They wanted to apply this principle to Germany. They disagreed with democracy, because they believed that it divided groups which made them weaker. The Nazis performed very badly in elections until the early 1930s, where they became exceptionally popular. This can be partly explained by a massive increase in poverty in Germany caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and Nazi promises to rebuild German strength and pride. However, this is not the only reason for the Nazis coming to power, because it still took more than three years for Adolf Hitler to become Chancellor of Germany after the Crash. On the night of the 27 February 1933 and 28 February 1933, someone set the Reichstag building on fire. This was the building where the German Parliament held their meetings. The Nazis blamed the communists. Opponents of the Nazis said that the Nazis themselves had done it to come to power. On the very same day, an emergency law called Reichstagsbrandverordnung was passed. The government claimed it was to protect the state from people trying to hurt the country. With this law, most of the civil rights of the Weimar Republic did not count any longer. The Nazis used this against the other political parties. Members of the communist and social- democratic parties were put into prison or killed. The Nazis became the biggest party in the parliament. By 1934, they managed to make all other parties illegal. Democracy was replaced with a dictatorship. Adolf Hitler became leader (Führer) of Germany, and had the power to make any laws he wanted. ==Life in Nazi Germany (1934-1945)== The Nazis changed Germany to fit their ideas of what a country should be like. They created a totalitarian state, which is a country where the government tries to have total control over ordinary people's lives. In schools, several subjects were changed to fit a Nazi interpretation. History was taught to emphasise German military victories and blames Jewish people and Marxists for defeat in WWI. Children were also taught racial hygiene lessons, where pseudo-scientific racist principles taught to them. In 1936, all German children had to be members of the Hitler Youth which was a Nazi version of the Scouting movement, and was designed to prepare them to be soldiers in wars against other races. People who opposed the Nazis were seen as traitors. The Nazis created a very effective police state, led by Heinrich Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich. They were in charge of an organisation called the Schutzstaffel (SS) that took control of all of the police forces in Germany. The SS also set up a new secret police organisation called the Gestapo which hunted down people who wanted to protest against the Nazi government. Enemies of the Nazis were regularly tortured, put in concentration camps or executed. ==Aggressive conquests== As the German leader (Führer) of Nazi Germany, Hitler began moving Nazi armies into neighboring countries. When Germany attacked Poland, World War II started. Western countries like France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were occupied and to be treated by Germany as colonies. However, in Eastern countries, such as Poland and the Soviet Union, the Nazis planned to kill or enslave the Slavic peoples, so that German settlers could take their land. ===Axis powers=== Nazi Germany allied with other European countries, such as Finland and Italy. Every other European country that allied with Germany did it because they did not want to be taken over by Germany. Through these alliances and invasions, the Nazis managed to control much of Europe. ==The Holocaust== In the Holocaust, Nazi Germany and his allies killed at least 6,000,000 Jews (67% of pre-war European Jews) in the Holocaust. * * * * * * * * * * * In addition to the Holocaust, Poles, Roma, * * * * * * * * * * Ukrainians, homosexuals, disabled people and political opponents were exterminated across Nazi-occupied European territories. The Nazis killed millions of these people in concentration camps with poison gas. The Nazis also killed millions of people in these groups by forcing them to do slave labor without giving them much food or clothing. ===Definition=== There have been debates on the definition of the Holocaust over the past decades. The mainstream definitions specifically define the Holocaust as the genocide of Jews by the Axis powers. As per the Holocaust Encyclopedia, run by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), As per the Yad Vashem, As per the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, As per the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), ===Justifications=== The Nazis justified the Holocaust with conspiracy theories based on self-victimization and inversion of reality. They accused Jews of controlling the world and blamed every problem on them. American historian Jeffrey Herf wrote in his book The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during World War II and the Holocaust: Contrary to common perception, Herf said that Nazis' view of the Jews being an inferior race was not the motive for the Holocaust. Instead, it was the stereotype of Jews being an \"all-powerful anti-German force\" that made the Holocaust happen: American legal scholar Kenneth L. Marcus presented the concept Accusation in a Mirror (AiM) to describe the tendency of genocide criminals – from Nazi Germans to Hutu nationalists – to accuse their victims of seeking a genocide against them in order to justify a genocide themselves. In psychology, such behaviour is called projection. ==Allied victory== In 1945, the Soviet Union took over Berlin after defeating the German army in Russia. The Soviet Red Army met the American and British armies, who had fought right across Germany after invading Nazi Europe from Normandy in France on June 6,1944. The Nazis lost because the Allies had many more soldiers and more money than them. During the invasion of Berlin, Hitler shot himself in a bunker with his new wife, Eva Braun. Other Nazis also killed themselves, including Joseph Goebbels just one day after Hitler named him as his successor. The Nazis surrendered after the Red Army captured Berlin. ==Nuremberg Trials== After the war, the Allied governments, namely the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, held trials of the Nazi leaders. These trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany. For this reason, these trials were called \"the Nuremberg Trials.\" The Allied leaders accused the Nazi leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murdering millions of people (in the Holocaust), of starting wars, of conspiracy, and belonging to illegal organizations like the SS (called, \"Schutzstaffel\", in German). Most Nazi leaders were found guilty by the court, and they were sent to jail or sentenced to death and executed. ==Post-war Nazism== There has not been a Nazi state since 1945, but there are still people who believe in those ideas. These people are often called Neo-Nazis. Here are some examples of modern Nazi ideas: * Germanic peoples are superior to all other races of people. * Many neo-Nazis change \"Germanic\" to \"all white people\". * They speak against Jews and sometimes other races. For example: ** They say that the Holocaust did not happen, and that it was made up by the Jews. ** They say that Hitler was right to blame Jewish people for Germany's problems after World War I; ** They tell people to hate Jewish people and other ethnic groups. ** They believe that Jews have too much power in the world. Moreover, British historian Roger Griffin defined fascism as a form of revolutionary nationalism hinged on the unity of a group to achieve a national rebirth (or palingenesis, Koine Greek: παλιγγενεσία). The definition was later adopted by historian Matthew Kott to redefine Nazism as a type of antisemitic fascism rooted in populist ultranationalism given that he saw the conventional definition of Nazism as too Germanocentric and unable to account for the massive local collaboration in Nazi-occupied territories. Kott cited the pre- war anti-German Latvian ultranationalist group Pērkonkrusts (\"Thunder Cross\") and Vidkun Quisling's Norwegian collaborationistRelating to traitorous cooperation with an enemy. Oxford Languages. group Nasjonal Samling (\"National Gathering\") as examples that an entity can still be Nazi without supporting Hitlerite Nazism. After the war, laws were made in Germany and other countries, especially countries in Europe, that make it illegal to say the Holocaust never happened. Sometimes, they also ban questioning the number of people affected by it and saying that it killed a smaller amount of people than it really did. There has been some controversy over whether this affects people's free speech. Certain countries, such as Germany, Austria, and France, also banned the use of Nazi symbols It is also banned to make a Nazi pledge position on a popular media source to stop Nazis from using them. ==Related pages== * Ustaše * Antiziganism * Black Hebrew Israelites * Nation of Islam and racism * Anti-Judaism and antisemitism ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Terrorism Category:Adolf Hitler Category:World War II Category:Antisemitism Category:History of Europe Category:Antisemitism in Europe",
