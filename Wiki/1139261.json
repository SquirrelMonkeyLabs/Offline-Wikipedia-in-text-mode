 "text": "Adagio and Allegro, Op. 70, is a chamber music piece in A-flat major for piano and horn (optionally cello, double bass, viola or violin) by Robert Schumann. It was made in February of 1849. At first, the name was meant to be \"Romance and Allegro\". Schumann later decided on the name \"Adagio and Allegro\". After this work was completed, Clara Schumann said that it was \"just the sort of piece that I like, brilliant, fresh and passionate.\"Humphries, John \"The Early Horn\" (Cambridge University Press, 2000) ==References== ==Other Website== * Category:Compositions by Robert Schumann Category:Chamber music compositions",
