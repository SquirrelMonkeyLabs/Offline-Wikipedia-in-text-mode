Jack the Ripper is believed to have killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888. There are previous murders, linked to a person called the Whitechapel murderer. Jack the Ripper likely did not commit them, though. Because of these murders, there had been considerable press and public attention.
