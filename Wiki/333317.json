 "text": "The voiced alveolar trill is a type of consonant. It is found in some spoken languages. It is usually called the rolled R, rolling R, or trilled R. The International Phonetic Alphabet letter for this sound is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is `r`. Dictionaries of languages like English and German sometimes use the symbol ⟨⟩. They have rhotic consonants that are not an alveolar trill. This is because typing the letter r is easier. In many Indo-European languages, this sound is sometimes an allophone of the alveolar tap . This happens especially in unstressed syllables. Some languages like Catalan, Spanish, Albanian and some Portuguese treat these as two different sounds. ==Features== ==Examples== Language Word IPA Meaning Arabic 'head' Dutch 'red' English Scottish 'curd' French southern France and Corsica 'red' German some dialects 'nonsense' Hindi 'house' Italian 'earth' Malay Standard 'direction' Russian; cited in 'to play' Spanish 'dog' ==References== Category:Consonants",
