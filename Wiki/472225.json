 "text": "Molossia, also known as the self-proclaimed Republic of Molossia, is a prominent micronation, founded by his excellency Kevin Baugh and headquartered in his home near Dayton, Nevada. Baugh has also been the president since 3 September 1999. Before holding this office Baugh was prime minister of Vuldstein, Edelstein, and Zaria from 1977 to 1999. He changed Molossia from a monarchy to a republic. Molossia is made up of Baugh's house (known as the Government House), about in size, as well as of surrounding property, enclaved by Nevada. It formerly claimed a property in Pennsylvania as well. According to author John Ryan, Molossia is \"a hobby that has been pushed to the nth degree.\" Originally established as a childhood project in 1977, Molossia subsequently evolved into a territorial entity in the late 1990s. The name Molossia is derived from the Spanish word morro which means \"small rocky hill\". Baugh has stated that the ancient Greek tribe of Molossians is unrelated. ==References== ==Other websites== *The Republic of Molossia official website Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:Geography of California Category:Geography of Nevada Category:Micronations",
