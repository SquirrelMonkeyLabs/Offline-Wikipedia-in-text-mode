 "text": "\"Debout Congalaise\" (, ; \"Arise, Congolese\") is the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ==Lyrics== French original Kikongo translation Lingala translation Swahili translation Tshiluba translation English translation I Arise, Congolese, united by fate, United in the struggle for independence, Let us hold up our heads, so long bowed, And now, for good, let us keep moving boldly ahead, in peace. Oh, ardent people, by hard work we shall build, In peace, a country more beautiful than before. Chorus: Countrymen, sing the sacred hymn of your solidarity, Proudly salute the golden emblem of your sovereignty, Congo. II Blessed gift Congo of our forefathers Congo, Oh country Congo that we love Congo, We shall people your soil and ensure your greatness. 30th June, oh gentle sun, 30th June of 30th June, Sacred day, be witness, sacred day of the immortal oath of freedom That we hand on to our children for ever. ==Related pages== * La Za√Øroise, the national anthem of Zaire ==References== Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of the Democratic Republic of the Congo",
