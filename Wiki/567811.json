 "text": "Nicodemo Domenico \"Little Nicky\" Scarfo (March 8, 1929 â€“ January 15, 2017) was a member of the American Mafia who eventually became the Boss of the Philadelphia crime family after the death of Angelo Bruno and Phil Testa. During his criminal career, Scarfo was described by some as psychotic, cruel and vicious. From many accounts of his former criminal associates who testified against him, he would want to murder someone if he was shown the slightest bit of disrespect or even if he was stared at. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American gangsters Category:People from Brooklyn",
