 "text": "Holiday Bash (2021) was a professional wrestling show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on December 22, 2021 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was the second Holiday Bash event held by AEW. The event aired as special episodes of Dynamite and Rampage respectively. Dynamite aired in it's normal timeslot while Rampage aired on delay on December 25 at 9pm ET. It was pushed back because of a tradition that TNT has where they show the 1983 movie A Christmas Story during their holiday marathon. Dynamite's main event of the event saw CM Punk, Sting, and Darby Allin defeat The Pinnacle (MJF and FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler)). Rampage's main event saw Cody Rhodes defeat Sammy Guevara to win the AEW TNT Championship. During the event, Kyle O'Reilly made his AEW debut. He helped Adam Cole during his match.
