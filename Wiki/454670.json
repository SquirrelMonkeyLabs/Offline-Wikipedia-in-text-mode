 "text": "In geometry, a line segment is a line between two different endpoints. It is represented by a line above the symbols of the two endpoints (such as \\overline{AB}). Unlike a line, a line segment does not extend beyond the endpoints. An example of a line segment is a side of a triangle. If the endpoints are on a curve, like a circle, then the line segment is called a chord. ==Related pages== * Line == References == Category:Geometry",
