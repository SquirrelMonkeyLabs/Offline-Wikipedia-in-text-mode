 "text": "The R179 is a class of 318 new technology (NTT) New York City Subway cars built by Bombardier Transportation for the B Division. The cars replaced all remaining R32s and R42s. The R179 is similar to the R160 and R143 but it runs on the A, C, J and Z lines. The R179 order originally contained 208 cars that were each long. In 2010-2014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were long - similar to the car lengths of the R143 and R160 cars - with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in five car sets because the R179s will be replacing the 75 foot long R44s, which will be arranged in 300 -foot- long car sets. The R179s have two doors at each end of each car and the R160 has the same. == References == Category:New York City Subway Category:Rolling stock",
