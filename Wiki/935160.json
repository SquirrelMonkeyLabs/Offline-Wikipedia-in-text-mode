 "text": "Central Asian Arabic (العربية الآسيوية الوسطى) is a severely endangered variety of Arabic historically spoken widely across Central Asia including Khorasan, but now dying out. Many are now switching to Persian or Tajik. ==History== Much of the region of Central Asia was under the rule of Islamic Arab caliphates. Many nomadic Arabs moved from Khuzestan and Oman to Samarkand and other parts of Central Asia. After Soviet forces took the region, Arabic started dying. The majority of Arabic speakers have switched to Dari in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. ==References== Category:Languages of Afghanistan Category:Languages of Uzbekistan Category:Languages of Tajikistan Category:Languages of Iran Category:Arabic language",
