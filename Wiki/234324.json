It has the singles \"Heaven Knows\" and \"Like the Angel\" as well as a cover of Journey's single, \"Any Way You Want It.\" The album had a limited release on vinyl (217 of which were on red vinyl) which is now out of print. It was the band's last release under Fat Wreck Chords before to their move to Geffen Records. This is where they released Siren Song of the Counter Culture in 2004.
