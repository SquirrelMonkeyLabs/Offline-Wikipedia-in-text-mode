 "text": "\"Lean wit Me\" is the third single off of American rapper Juice Wrld's debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance. The song was released on May 22, 2018, a day before the album was released. The song was able to make it to #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is certified 5Ã— Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Juice Wrld made the song about his struggle with drug addiction. On August 1, 2018, a music video for the song was released. In the video, Juice is seen taking part in a twelve-step program and performing a Serenity Prayer. While he is rapping his backstory, it's shown that he went to the program after his girlfriend overdosed. The music video cuts from Juice rapping at the program to shots and flashbacks of him and his girlfriend doing drugs and doing crime. The music video ends with Juice calling 911 and telling them that his girlfriend overdosed and died. The video fades to black and the message \"RIP to too many young legends that left us early. If you or somebody you know is suffering from addiction call 1-800-662-HELP to take the first step\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2018 songs Category:Juice Wrld songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Songs about drugs",
