The spots have dark edges. It has short front legs. There is light red color on the bottoms of the back legs. There is brown color on the toes. The insides of the back legs are white with brown spots. The female frog lays eggs in foam nests on plants near water. People have seen this frog between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. Scientists named this frog hongchibiensis after the place where they found it: Hongchiba. Honchiba is the largest alpine grassland in China. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it only lives two small places. One of them is a protected park: Micang Mountain National Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
