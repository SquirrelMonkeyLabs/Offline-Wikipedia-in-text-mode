 "text": "Thomas Stewart Baker (born 20 January 1934), who is known professionally by his credited stage name as Tom Baker, is an English character actor and writer. He is perhaps best known for his work by playing the Fourth Doctor in the long-running BBC science fiction television programme, Doctor Who. ==Early life== Baker was born in Liverpool. His father was a sailor, and was Jewish. His mother was Roman Catholic. Baker was not very academic and struggled at school. He failed the eleven plus exam. Baker became a monk when he was 15. When he decided to change his life, he first worked in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and then as a construction worker. He took up acting first as a hobby, then professionally. ==Career== His first big part was as Grigori Rasputin in the 1971 movie, Nicholas and Alexandra. Baker is best known for playing the Fourth Doctor in the long-running science fiction television series Doctor Who. He played this role from 1974 to 1981. When he got the job, he was working on a building site, because it was hard to find work as an actor. He is famous for playing the Doctor longer than any other actor. His version of the character is probably the best remembered by many people. As he thought of himself as a role model for children, he would always pretend to be the Doctor in real life, and sign autographs for them. He did not like to see too much violence in Doctor Who. He once changed the script so the Doctor threatened a character with a jelly baby instead of a knife. He was a narrator for the comedy sketch show Little Britain. Baker has had many jobs as a voiceover artist. He is very recognized for his voice. In a 2005 survey of British adults, Baker's voice was the fourth most recognisable after the Queen, Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher.BT Bring in the voice of Baker ==Works== ===Movies=== Year Title Role Notes 1968 The Winter's Tale The bear 1971 Nicholas and Alexandra Rasputin 1972 The Canterbury Tales Jenkin 1973 Cari Genitori Karl 1973 The Vault of Horror Moore 1973 Luther Pope Leo X Doesn't appear in some versions of the film 1973 Frankenstein: The True Story Sea captain 1973 The Golden Voyage of Sinbad Koura 1974 The Mutations Lynch 1980 The Curse of King Tut's Tomb Hasan 1984 The Passionate Pilgrim Sir Tom Short film 1984 The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood Sir Guy de Gisbourne 1998 Backtime Sarge 2000 Dungeons & Dragons Halvarth 2005 The Magic Roundabout Zeebad 2010 The Genie in the Bottle Narrator Short film 2011 Jacqueline Hill: A Life in Pictures The Doctor 2012 Saving Santa Santa Claus Voice ===Television=== Year Title Role Notes 1968 Dixon of Dock Green The man Episode: \"The Attack\" 1968 Market in Honey Lane Doorman Episode: \"The Matchmakers\" 1968 George and the Dragon Porter Episode: \"The 10:15 Train\" 1968 Z-Cars Harry Russell Episode: \"Hudson's Way\" 1968 Dixon of Dock Green Foreman Episode: \"Number 13\" 1969 Thirty-Minute Theatre Corporal Schabe Episode: \"The Victims: Frontier\" 1970 Softly, Softly Site foreman Episode: \"Like Any Other Friday\" 1972 Play of the Month Dr. Ahmed el Kabir Episode: \"The Millionairess\" 1973 Arthur of the Britons Brandreth / Gavron Episode: \"Go Warily\" 1974–1981 Doctor Who The Doctor 172 episodes 1975 Jim'll Fix It The Doctor 1 episode 1976 Piccadilly Circus Mark Ambient 1977 Nouvelles de Henry James Mark Ambient 1978 Late Night Story Host 4 episodesscreenonline: Late Night Story, 17 January 2008 1979 The Book Tower Presenter 22 episodes 1982 The Hound of the Baskervilles Sherlock Holmes 1983 Jemima Shore Investigates Dr. Norman Ziegler Episode: \"Dr. Ziegler's Casebook\" 1983 Doctor Who The Doctor Episode: \"The Five Doctors\" 1984 Remington Steele Anatole Blaylock Episode: \"Hounded Steele\" 1985 Jackanory Storyteller Episode: \"The Iron Man\" 1986 The Life and Loves of a She-Devil Father Ferguson 1986 Blackadder II Captain Redbeard Rum Episode: \"Potato\" 1986 The Kenny Everett Television Show Patient John Thompson Blu-Tac Tom Season 1, Episode 2 1986 Roland Rat: The Series BBC Three presenter The Doctor Season 4, Episode 1 1990 The Silver Chair Puddleglum 1990 Tales of Aesop Narrator 1990 Hyperland Software agent 1990 Boom Co-presenter 1991 Selling Hitler Manfred Fischer 4 episodes 1992 Cluedo Professor Plum 6 episodes 1992 Screen Two Sir Lionel Sweeting Episode: \"The Law Lord\" 1992–1995 Medics Professor Geoffrey Hoyt 1993 Doctor Who The Doctor Episode: \"Dimensions in Time\" 1994 The Imaginatively Titled Punt & Dennis Show Actor in supermarket Cameo 1998 Have I Got News For You Himself 2000 This Is Your Life Himself 2000 The Canterbury Tales Simpkin Voice Episode: \"The Journey Back\" 2000 Max Bear Max Bear Voice 2000–2001 Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) Professor Wyvern 10 episodes 2001 Fun at the Funeral Parlour Quimby Episode: \"The Jaws of Doom\" 2003 Swiss Toni Derek Asquith Episode: \"Cars Don't Make You Fat\" 2003 2DTV The Doctor Voice Series 4, Episode 1 2003 Strange Father Bernard Episode: \"Asmoth\" 2003 Fort Boyard Captain Baker 2003–2006 Little Britain Narrator 36 episodes 2004 The Little Reindeer Santa Claus Voice 2004–2005 Monarch of the Glen Donald MacDonald 12 episodes 2006 The Secret Show Robert Baron Voice Episode: \"The Secret Room\" 2007 Marple Frederick Treves Episode: \"Towards Zero\" 2007–2008 The Beeps Narrator 45 episodes 2008 Little Britain USA Narrator 6 episodes 2008 Have I Got News For You Himself 2010 Tom Baker: In Confidence Himself Interviewed by Professor Laurie Taylor ===Video games=== Year Title Role Notes 1997 Destiny of the Doctors The Doctor Voice and likeness 2000 Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future Narrator Voice 2001 Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising Narrator Voice 2003 Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior Narrator Voice 2004 Sudeki Narrator Voice 2005 Heretic Kingdoms: The Inquisition Narrator Voice 2005 MediEvil: Resurrection Death Voice 2006 Cold Winter John Gray Voice 2006 Little Britain: The Game Narrator Voice 2007 Little Britain: The Video Game Narrator Voice ===Radio=== Year Title Role 1994 The Russia House Barley BlairUPC: 9780563394730 1998 Hard Times Josiah Bounderby 1999 Nicholas Nickleby Vincent Crummles 2009 Hornets' Nest The Doctor 2010 Demon Quest The Doctor 2011 Serpent Crest The Doctor ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:English movie actors Category:English television actors Category:English voice actors Category:Actors from Liverpool",
