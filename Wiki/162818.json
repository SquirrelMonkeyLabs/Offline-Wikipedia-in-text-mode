 "text": "Chromalveolata is a eukaryote supergroup first proposed by Thomas Cavalier- Smith as a refinement of his kingdom Chromista, which was first proposed in 1981. The origin of the Chromalveolata was thought to be a secondary endosymbiosis between a bikont (cell with two flagella) and a red alga. This union led to plastids containing chlorophyll c. In Cavalier-Smith's classification, the Chromalveolata was one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes. The classification has been challenged. == References == Category:Algae Category:Protista Category:Eukaryotes",
