In the beginning, the university had many problems and until 2004 or 2005 mostly boys joined it to study, very few women were allowed by their families to go there.The Higher Education Commission of Pakistan: Report On the Status of Women Enrollment in Public Sector Universities, 2002 to 2007, Islamabad, HEC Press, August 2007 This was because it was in a very conservative area where women were not encouraged to study. Slowly, more and more women started to join this university to get higher education.Higher Education Commission Report, 2007 Today, there are almost around 3000 women studying here and they have changed the attitudes of local people a lot. ==References== Category:Colleges and universities in Pakistan Category:Mansehra District",
