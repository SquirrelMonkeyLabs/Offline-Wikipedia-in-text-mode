And there's nothing more fun than coloring,\" explains vocalist Craig Owens about the decision to include the coloring book with the EP. ==History== Owens and Bell were both in Chiodos at the time Cinematic Sunrise formed.

The pair's pop rock project is all about having a good time and making music that is innocent and fun to play. The record was first released with four color pencils. These would be used in a book that includes drawings of animals with pictures of the band members hidden somewhere in the coloring page. Craig Owens said in an interview that he wanted crayons, not colored pencils. He was supposedly not happy with Equal Vision's mistake. On October 14, 2008, Equal Vision Records re-released A Coloring Storybook and Long-Playing Record. The re-release includes two bonus tracks. They were titled \"If Lilly Isn't Back by Sunset\" and \"Crossing Our Fingers for Summer\". === Track listing === Source: Amazon ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:American rock bands Category:American pop music groups Category:Emo bands Category:Musical groups from Detroit",
