 "text": "The iPod touch is a media player created and sold by Apple Inc. The public first saw it at an Apple meeting called \"The Beat Goes On\" on September 5, 2007. The iPod touch was famous for its touch screen. It has internet access with YouTube and the iTunes store. Apple sold it with either 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB of storage. The iPod touch can see the last ten songs played in a Starbucks café through Wi-Fi within the location of the iPod. The user can download tracks from the online iTunes music store with an iPod touch. This feature is to be offered in some Starbucks stores in the US. Right now, there are no plans to expand its Wi-Fi iTunes stores in any other country than the United States. The iPod touch's touchscreen ability is the same as the iPhone's. Like the iPhone, the iPod touch also has a physical home button separate from the touch screen. The home screen includes a headphone set, an alarm clock and also a list of buttons corresponding to the available applications: Music, Videos, Photos, and iTunes on the bottom button row. Safari, Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Calculator, and Settings are at the top. The iPod touch is also sold with 28 wallpaper photos, some of which are figures from the iPod advertisements. As of September 9, 2014, when iPod Classic was discontinued, iPod Shuffle, iPod Nano and iPod Touch were the only ones still manufactured. The iPod touch is the only remaining iPod still being manufactured as of July 27, 2017, when the iPod nano and iPod shuffle were discontinued. Apple concluded the iPod touch on May 10, 2022. However, the iPod touch was still available at Apple's online store while supplies lasted. == Models == # iPod 1st Generation (iOS 1 to 3.1.3) # iPod 2nd Generation (iOS 2 to 4.2.1) # iPod 3rd Generation (iOS 3 to 5.1.1) # iPod 4th Generation (iOS 4 to 6.1.6) # iPod 5th Generation (iOS 6 to 9.3.5) # iPod 6th Generation (iOS 8.4 to 12.5.5) # iPod 7th Generation Current Model (iOS 12.4 to 15.8.3) Model Picture Capacity RAM Connection Original release date Minimum OS to sync Rated battery life (hours) 1st generation 8 GB 16 GB 32 GB 128 MB USB via dock connector (FireWire for charging only) iPhone OS 1.1: September 14, 2007 iPhone OS 1.1.3: January 30, 2008 32 GB: February 5, 2008 Mac: 10.4 or later Win: XP, Vista, 7 audio: 22 video: 5 The first generation iPod touch was launched on September 5, 2007, at an event called The Beat Goes On.

On either operating system, the iPod touch needs a USB 2.0 port on the computer to connect.Apple - iPod touch - Technical Specifications, Apple Inc., (December 5, 2007).

Retrieved on December 9, 2007 However, after October 12, 2011, new iPods that were bought will have iOS 5 installed and that means users can set up the iPod wirelessly, without connecting it to a computer. It also means that users do not have to connect their iPod to a computer in order to sync and back up data. All of this will be done through Apple's iCloud service. The official requirements for the iPod touch are:Apple - iPod touch - Technical Specifications, Apple Inc., (December 9, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2007 * A computer running either: ** Mac OS X 10.4.10 or later ** Microsoft Windows XP (Home or Professional x32 Edition) with SP2, or Microsoft Windows Vista (32 bit OS only )iPod: Minimum System Requirements , Apple Inc., (October 16, 2007). Retrieved on December 9, 2007 * iTunes 7.4 or later * Available USB 2.0 port * Internet access == Wi-Fi == The iPod touch is included with Wi-Fi 802.11b/g, and, like the iPhone, has the Safari web browser and YouTube. The iPod's Wi-Fi ability can also be used to buy music from the iTunes Store. == Third-party applications == On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, gave an open letter posted on Apple's webpage, announced that a software development kit (SDK) for the iPhone would be made ready to third- party developers in February 2008. Because of security concerns and Jobs' praise of Nokia's digital signature system, it is also suggested that Apple will adopt a similar method. The SDK will also apply to the iPod touch. However, end-users have still been able to \"jailbreak\" the iPod touch in similar methods to the iPhone, allowing the usage of third-party applications created by users. The most popular iPod touch jailbreak method is a website which takes advantage of a TIFF exploit in the iPod touch's web browser to execute the code in order to install the hacks. The site also patches the exploit as well. This method only worked on the 1.1.1 firmware, as 1.1.2 fixed the exploit needed for the installer to work. == Software upgrades == During the initial launch of the iPod touch, reviews noted some differences compared to Apple's similar iPhone. One of the primary criticisms of the iPod touch is the absence of the iPhone's email, mapping and stock tracking applications. On January 15, 2008, Steve Jobs announced at his Macworld 2008 keynote that the January Software Upgrade for the iPod touch consisted of five new applications: Mail, Maps, Stocks, Notes and Weather. The new Maps feature is similar to that of the iPhone, with new software from Skyhook Wireless that pinpoints the user's location using Wi-Fi. The software upgrade is available for current iPod touch owners via iTunes download for US$19.99.[1] New iPod touch units with 1.1.3 installed (MA623LL/B or MA627LL/B) will also have the software upgrade pre-installed.[2]Customers who purchase an iPod touch with part number MA623LL/A or MA627LL/A must pay the upgrade fee to receive the new applications. == Comparisons to the iPhone == The first reviews of the iPod touch have cited some differences compared to Apple's similar iPhone. In addition to what was previously indicated regarding the differences that were subsequently considered and included in the January 2008 software upgrade, another complaint mentioned that the iPod touch had no physical buttons for volume control - a feature that the iPhone had. The iPod touch instead used software-based controls, which makes users to double click the home button, bringing up an on-screen volume control. The iPod touch also did not have the iPhone's external speakers, built-in camera, and Bluetooth capability, but the 2nd generation onward has external speakers and the Bluetooth capability. The fourth generation, released in September 2010, was the first iPod touch to feature the retina display and two built-in cameras for FaceTime and for videos and still photos. At least one critic has suggested that Apple may have left out these applications and hardware features on purpose in order to differentiate the iPod touch from its more expensive cousin, the iPhone. Others say that the touch does not need the applications mentioned above because it's an iPod and not a mobile phone. However, the 2009 model of the iPod touch does feature Bluetooth, but only to link with bluetooth headphones.Apple's iPod touch Is a Beauty of a Player Short on Battery Life (September 20, 2007). Retrieved on October 6, 2007 By now, the 5th-generation iPod touch mostly has the same functions as the iPhone, but is not quite as powerful, uses an inferior camera, lacks a built-in GPS, and lacks cell phone capabilities. However, it is cheaper than the iPhone, and also thinner, making it more portable. == Manufacturing flaws == A number of early iPod touch users have complained that their iPod's screen could not properly display shades of black. The problem has been related to the bad reflective coating on the LCD display and bad quality control. The defect caused the screen to have very narrow optimal viewing angle (hard to look at the screen from the side) and also resulted in \"shimmering\" blacks. This screen problem was later fixed with the firmware update 1.1.1 although some still complained that the screen still could not properly display certain shades of black. Critics also say that the update simply \"alleviates\" the screen problem by adjusting contrast settings and does not provide a fix for the screen itself. == Specifications == The specifications as listed on Apple's website are:Apple - iPod touch - Technical Specifications, Apple Inc., (September 5, 2007).
