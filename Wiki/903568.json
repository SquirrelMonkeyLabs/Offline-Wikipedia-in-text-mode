 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic first started in Massachusetts in early February 2020. The first COVID-19 case was in Boston. That was February 1, 2020. From March 5, the number of COVID-19 cases began growing very rapidly. As of Sunday, February 6, 2022, about 22,600 people in the state of Massachusetts had died from COVID-19 or its related health effects. As of then, over 5.2 million people in the state were fully vaccinated. Just over half of them had the booster shots. During the United States' 2021–22 winter, COVID-19 went up in the state almost four times that of the winter before (2020–21). By February 2022, however, overall rates started to fall again. The February 6 statistics showed just under 1,502,250 cases in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts laws and rules stated that anyone over age five could get two shots. Only those age eighteen and older, however, can apply for and receive the boosters. ==Related pages== * COVID-19 pandemic in the United States * COVID-19 pandemic (other regions) ==References== Massachusetts Category:21st century in Massachusetts",
