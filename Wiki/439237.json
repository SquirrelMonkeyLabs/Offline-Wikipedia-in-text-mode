 "text": "Bond girls are female characters in James Bond movies, books and video games. They play the love interest of Bond. There are no set rules on what kind of role a Bond girl plays. Some examples of Bond girls are Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Vivienne Michel. Bond girls are usually aged in their early-to- mid 20s, about 10 years younger than Bond. Their normal dress is conventional without much jewellery. The dress style, however, varies. There have been only two movies in which Bond falls in love with a Bond girl and actually marries one of them. The first was was On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), where Bond falls in love with and marries Countess Tereza di Vicenzo played by Diana Rigg, who is shot dead during their honeymoon. The most recent of them was Casino Royale (2006), where Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green. Ursula Andress played the character Honey Ryder in Dr. No (1962) and Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale (1967). Halle Berry's was a character in Die Another Day. Others who were Bond girls are Britt Ekland, Claudine Auger, Lois Chiles, Carole Bouquet, Tanya Roberts, Teri Hatcher, Gemma Arterton, Rosamund Pike and LÃ©a Seydoux. ==References==",
