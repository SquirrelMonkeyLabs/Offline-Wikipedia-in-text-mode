 "text": "The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success â€“ A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams is a small self-help book from 1994 by Deepak Chopra. It was first published by New World Library. The book is inspired by Hinduist and spiritual ideas. It suggests that personal success doesn't just come from hard work, plans, or ambition. Instead, it comes from understanding our basic human nature and following the laws of nature. According to the book, by applying these laws in our lives, we can create whatever we want. It says that the same laws nature uses to create things like forests, stars, and human bodies can also help us achieve our deepest desires. ==References== Category:Self-help books",
