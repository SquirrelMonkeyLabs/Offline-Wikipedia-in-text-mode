 "text": "The robust Buerger's frog, brown tree frog, or strong stream tree frog (Buergeria robusta) is a frog. It lives in Taiwan. People find this frog on hills and mountains. They find them in forests with streams in them. The female frog lays her eggs in the water with no nest or foam. The eggs sit on stones or between stones. The tadpoles swim in streams and pools. People see this frog between 0 and 1800 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of extinction because it lives in a large place. Many of the places it lives are protected parks. But people cut down its forests to build farms and other infrastructure. Sometimes people catch this frog to eat. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
