 "text": "The Alagoas heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes acuminatus) is a frog. It lives in Brazil, in the state of Pernambuco. People have seen it as high as 550 meters above sea level. ==Home== People have seen this frog in bromeliad plants near the outer parts of forests. Scientists think it might live deep in the forest in the place where the branches meet like a roof, but they have not seen them there. This frog is not in danger of dying out. Scientists say that it is good at living in places that human beings have changed a little, but not in places that human beings have changed a lot. Scientists say that the danger is that human beings change the places where it lives to build towns, build farms, get wood to build with, and make places for animals to eat grass. ==Life cycle== The mother frog lays eggs on the leaves of bromeliad plants. She lays one egg at a time. When the egg hatches, the tadpole falls into the pool of water in the bromeliad plant. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
