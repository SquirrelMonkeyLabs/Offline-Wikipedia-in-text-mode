 "text": "Radical Face is a musical act whose main member is Ben Cooper, who sings and plays multiple instruments. All the sounds are put together on a computer. Cooper is also in Electric President, an electronic music group. However, Radical Face has an acoustic sound. Radical Face's music has been on television programmes and in the movie Wish I Was Here. ==History== Cooper's first album to be recorded under the name Radical Face was The Junkyard Chandelier (2003). The album was never released. However, it can be downloaded for free online. Ghost was the first official studio album, released in March 2007. On November 16, 2010, Cooper released an EP titled Touch The Sky. It was a preview for a trilogy of albums called Family Tree. This trilogy is about a fictional family from the 1800s, the Northcotes. It is also really about Cooper's own life. The albums are The Roots, The Branches, and The Leaves. Another EP, The Bastards: Volume One, was released before The Roots. In August 2011, iTunes accidentally released The Roots to users outside of the US. It was released in the US on October 4, 2011. The Family Tree: The Branches was released on October 22, 2013 in America and on November 1 in Europe. The Bastards: Volume Two was also released that year. The Bastards: Volume Three and The Bastards: Volume Four were both released in 2015, before the release of The Family Tree: The Leaves in March 2016. The Leaves has songs that are about Cooper's own life. Clone, an album by Ben Cooper and Richard Colado, was supposed to be released before fall of 2012, but it kept getting delayed. The first track of the album, \"The Laboratory\", was finally released on September 23, 2014. Cooper then released one track per week. ==Discography== ===Albums=== Title, Notes on release Track listing The Junkyard Chandelier 2003 Self-released. #\"Stitches In My Side\" - 3:27 #\"The Scarecrows Are Marching\" - 4:51 #\"Martyr\" - 3:47 #\"Chewing Bottles\" - 5:14 #\"Junkyard Chandelier\" - 6:18 #\"Paper Birds\" - 4:24 #\"Fog In The House Of Lightbulbs\" - 6:43 #\"Runs In The Sidewalk\" - 5:36 #\"Confidants And Fish Hooks\" - 4:59 #\"Pockets Full Of Ink\" - 5:21 #\"Burning Bridges\" - 3:13 Ghost Released in 2007. \"Welcome Home\" was awarded Song of the year by \"Which?\" #\"Asleep On A Train\" - 2:00 #\"Welcome Home\" - 4:45 #\"Let The River In\" - 5:05 #\"Glory\" - 6:14 #\"The Strangest Things\" - 4:25 #\"Wrapped In Piano Strings\" - 3:37 #\"Along The Road\" - 4:13 #\"Haunted\" - 4:43 #\"Winter Is Coming\" - 4:20 #\"Sleepwalking\" - 4:43 #\"Homesick\" - 3:39 The Family Tree: The Roots Released in 2011. #\"Names\" - 1:15 #\"A Pound of Flesh\" - 3:35 #\"Family Portrait\" - 4:40 #\"Black Eyes\" - 4:44 #\"Severus and Stone\" - 4:28 #\"The Moon Is Down\" - 3:18 #\"Ghost Towns\" - 3:54 #\"Kin\" - 4:04 #\"The Dead Waltz\" - 5:23 #\"Always Gold\" - 5:56 #\"Mountains\" - 4:51 The Family Tree: The Branches Released in 2013. #\"Gray Skies\" - 0:43 #\"Holy Branches\" - 3:38 #\"The Mute\" - 3:56 #\"Reminders\" - 3:34 #\"Summer Skeletons\" - 4:51 #\"The Crooked Kind\" - 4:39 #\"Chains\" - 2:11 #\"Letters Home\" - 4:12 #\"From The Mouth Of An Injured Head\" - 4:04 #\"Southern Snow\" - 3:21 #\"The Gilded Hand\" - 6:15 #\"We All Go The Same\" - 3:31 The Family Tree: The Leaves Released in 2016. #\"Secrets (Cellar Door)\" - 4:26 #\"Rivers in the Dust\" - 5:45 #\"Everything Costs\" - 3:42 #\"Midnight\" - 3:10 #\"The Ship in Port\" - 3:43 #\"Photograph\" - 2:24 #\"Third Family Portrait\" - 3:45 #\"The Road to Nowhere\" - 4:46 #\"Old Gemini\" - 4:15 #\"Bad Blood\" - 4:51 ===EPs=== Title Year Track listing Touch The Sky EP 2010 #\"Welcome Home (EP Version) - 4:47 #\"Glory (Acoustic)\" - 4:34 #\"Doorways\" - 3:00 #\"A Little Hell\" - 2:13 #\"The Deserter's Song\" - 4:55 #\"Welcome Home (Reprise)\" - 2:29 The Bastards: Volume One 2011 #\"All Is Well (It's Only Blood)\" - 2:45 #\"All Is Well (Goodbye, Goodbye)\" - 4:05 #\"We're On Our Way\" - 4:08 Always Gold EP 2012 #\"Always Gold (Short Attention Span Mix)\" - 4:04 #\"Echoes\" - 3:54 #\"Wandering (Alternative Mix)\" - 3:46 #\"Always Gold (Acoustic)\" - 3:38 #\"We're On Our Way\" - 4:07 #\"Always Gold (Album Version)\" - 5:55 The Bastards: Volume Two 2013 #\"Second Family Portrait\" - 4:55 #\"West\" - 4:50 #\"Letters Home - Aftermath\" - 1:18 The Bastards: Volume Three 2014 #\"Sisters\" - 3:49 #\"Baptisms\" - 2:56 #\"Nightclothes\" - 6:54 The Bastards: Volume Four 2015 #\"Servants And Kings\" #\"Small Hands\" ===Singles=== Year Title Chart Certification Album FR NED SWI 2011 \"Welcome Home\" 83 24 38 Ghost === Music videos === Year Song Album 2007 Welcome Home Ghost 2010 Doorways Touch The Sky EP 2012 We're On Our Way The Bastards: Volume One 2012 A Pound of Flesh The Family Tree: The Roots 2012 Always Gold The Family Tree: The Roots 2013 Holy Branches The Family Tree: The Branches 2014 The Mute The Family Tree: The Branches 2016 Secrets (Cellar Door) The Family Tree: The Leaves 2016 The Road To Nowhere The Family Tree: The Leaves ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Page *The Sounds & Sights of Radical Face - Short documentary by Justin Mitchell *Radical Face Live in San Francisco - 2011 Behind the Scenes video By Connor Ellmann Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Florida",
