Truancy is usually the result of the student's will and decision not to attend without a valid or real excuse, such as a medical condition. School systems and education in general include laws and clear regulations regarding truancy and the necessary procedures for addressing it. Being present at school but not attending classes or lessons is referred to as skipping school lessons. == Punishments == === United States === Truancy in the United States is punished by school officials and monitored by parents/guardians.
