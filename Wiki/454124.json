She was also the co-founder of toy company Mattel with her husband Elliot. She was the company's first president from 1945 to 1975. The Handlers were forced to resign from Mattel in 1975 after the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the company for faking financial documents and for committing tax evasion. Handler was born in Denver, Colorado. She died from complications of colon cancer surgery at age 85 in Los Angeles. Handler was played by Rhea Perlman in the 2023 movie Barbie. ==References== Category:Businesspeople from Denver Category:1916 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Deaths from colorectal cancer Category:American inventors Category:Cancer deaths in Los Angeles Category:Deaths from surgical complications",
