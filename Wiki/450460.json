He is younger than the characters, despite being younger, he's in the same class as them and the show's creator Eric Robles explained on the Nickelodeon message board that this is because Fanboy snuck him into his class and the teacher never noticed the age difference.

He often refers to the children he meets as \"earth larvae\". ==Reception and achievements== ===Reviews=== Aaron H. Bynum of Animation Insider called Fanboy & Chum Chum \"a fun show that deserves a good look. The quality animation helps counterbalance the immense amount of dialogue from the series' chatty characters, and the sheer comedy of marginally competent comic-loving kids helps outweigh what might otherwise be a binge of geeky annoyance. But overall, Fanboy & Chum Chum is a lot of fun.\" Variety praised the series' \"bright, energetic look and even an appealing premise in theory\". David Hinckley of NY Daily News gave the series three stars out of five, and said that \"it's good [but] might not be the next SpongeBob\". ===Ratings=== The series premiered on November 6, 2009, after the SpongeBob SquarePants film Truth or Square.
