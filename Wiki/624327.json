 "text": "Giorgia Meloni (born 15 January 1977) is an Italian politician and journalist who is the Prime Minister of Italy since 2022. She has also been the president of Fratelli d'Italia since 2014. Meloni was Minister of Youth from 2008 to 2011. She was also a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2006. In a record-low voter turnout election, exit polls projected that the centre-right coalition would win a majority of seats in the 2022 Italian general election. Meloni was crowned the winner of the election with her party, FdI, receiving a plurality of seats, and per agreement with the centre-right coalition, the largest party in the coalition would nominate the next prime minister which made her the frontrunner. On 21 October 2022, President Sergio Mattarella designated her as the next Prime Minister of Italy, making her the first woman to hold this office. After she became prime minister, people have debated how right-wing a Meloni-led government would be. Many commentators have described it as Italy's first far-right-led government since World War II, and Meloni as the first far-right leader since Benito Mussolini, and some academics also described it as the most right-wing government since 1945. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Rome Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Prime ministers of Italy Category:Current national leaders",
