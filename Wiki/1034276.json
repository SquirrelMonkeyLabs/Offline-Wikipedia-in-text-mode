 "text": "The Theatre of Thorikos (), was an old Greek theater, located north of Lavrio, built between 525 BC and 480 BC. The theater is special for its unique design since it is elongated instead of the usual semicircle. == History == The Thorikos theatre was built in different parts. The first part was built in the end of the archaic period around 525â€“480 BC. This makes the theatre one of the oldest Greek buildings that are still standing. The theater has a unique shape because it was built before theater designs were established. Now, it is believed that the shape resulted from expansions made to the seating area after its initial construction. The theater became longer when it was expanded during the classical period in the 4th century BC, and some changes were made as early as 300 BC. == References == Category:Theatres Category:Buildings and structures in Greece",
