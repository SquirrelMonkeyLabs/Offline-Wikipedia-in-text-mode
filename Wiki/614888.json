The victims had all taken Tylenol-branded acetaminophen capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. Seven people were killed in the original poisonings, with several more killed in subsequent copycat crimes. ==Effects== These incidents led to reforms in the packaging of over-the-counter medications and to federal anti-tampering laws. The actions of Johnson & Johnson to reduce deaths and warn the public of poisoning risks have been widely praised as an exemplary public relations response to such a crisis. No suspect was ever charged or convicted of the poisonings. New York City resident James William Lewis, who was the prime suspect, was convicted only of extortion for sending a letter to Johnson & Johnson that took credit for the deaths and demanded $1 million. ==References== Category:1982 in the United States Category:1980s in Chicago Category:1980s murders in the United States Category:Crime in Illinois Category:Mass murder in the 1980s Category:Mass murder in the United States Category:Unsolved murders in the United States",
