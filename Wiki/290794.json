 "text": "Follicle-stimulating hormone (abbreviated FSH, sometimes called Follitropine) is a glycoprotein and hormone. It is synthesised in the adeno hypophysis of pituitary gland. In females, it controls the synthesising process of progesteron and will cause the growth of follicles in the ovaries. In males, it will lead to the production of sperm. Other hormones control the release of FSH. Luteinizing hormone will cause ovulation in females, or the production of testosterone in males. This hormone is made by the pituitary glands in the brain. ==Related pages== *Peptide hormone Category:Hormones Category:Female reproductive system",
