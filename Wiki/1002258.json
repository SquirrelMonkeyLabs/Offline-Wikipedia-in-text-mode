 "text": "Catherine Eddowes (14 April 1842 – 30 September 1888) was the fourth of the five victims of the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper is believed to have killed and mutilated at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 96–113 Eddowes was murdered in the early hours of Sunday 30 September within the City of London. She was the second woman killed within an hour. Elizabeth Stride had already been killed, the same night, likely by the same person. These two murders are commonly referred to as the \"double event\";Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114–140 a term which originates from the content of the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard received at the Central News Agency on 1 October. Part of a left human kidney, accompanied by a letter addressed From Hell and postmarked 15 October, was later sent to the chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, George Lusk. The author of this letter claimed the section of kidney was from Eddowes, whose left kidney had been removed, and that he had fried and eaten the other half. Most experts, however, do not believe this kidney actually originated from Eddowes's body.Honeycombe, The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970, p. 60 == References == Category:1842 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Victims of Jack the Ripper",
