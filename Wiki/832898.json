The Aerophone part of Celloridoo is played with continuously vibrating lips to produce the drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing. This requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously expelling stored air out of the mouth using the tongue and cheeks and the chordophone part is played with a bow. A chordophone needs a Pegbox, a neck and a resonance box, and an aerophone needs a pipe and a mouthpiece so the pipe under the mouthpiece became to peg box and neck to install finger board on it, and the lowest part of it became to a resonance box to install bridges, holes and keep the strings. == Awards == * 1st prize of Iran's Universitarian Humor Festival 2008 * Honorable Mention of Iran's Geotourism Film Festival 2009 * Finalist of Sci-fi Vehicle Design Challenge 2010 * Finalist of Young Iranian Caricaturists Festival 2010 * Special Prize of \"Devil Against …\" International Festival, Caricature Section 2011 * Finalist of 11th Humor Festival of Caratinga, Brazil - Caricature Section 2011 * Bronze A'Design Award, Italy 2015 * Movie Design Award, Italy 2017 * Sticker of the Year Award 2019 == Jury Membership == * A’DESIGN Award: 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 * Design Excellence Award: 2018 * Archstorming Design Competition: 2018 * Asia Design Prize: 2019 * LIT Award, USA, 2019: 2020 * Design that Educates Award: 2019, 2020, 2021 * Azerbaijan Design Awards: 2020 * Industart Awards: 2019 * Envent Design Challenge: 2019 * Ukrainian Design Awards: 2020 * IDA: 2020 * European Product Design Awards: 2020 * Stevie Awards: 2020 == References == Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tehran",
