 "text": "A middle name is a name given to a person at birth or baptism. It is different from a given name and surname. In most Western countries the given name comes first (before the last name or family name). However, in many Eastern countries such as China it comes after the last name or family name, and occasionally also in Europe, e.g. in Hungarian. == References ==",
