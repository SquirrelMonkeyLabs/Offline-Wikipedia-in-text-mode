 "text": "The Centennial Light is an incandescent light bulb that has been on near- continuously since 1901. It is located at 4550 East Avenue, Livermore, California. It has also been noted by Guinness World Records. == History == The Centennial Light was manufactured in Shelby, Ohio, by the Shelby Electric Company in the late 1890s. In 1901, Dennis Bernal donated the bulb to the fire department after he sold the Livermore Power and Water company. The bulb was first located in a hose cart house on L Street, and then moved to the main firehouse on Second Street shortly after. In 1903, the bulb was moved to the new Station 1 firehouse. The bulb stayed there for 73 years. In 1976, the bulb was moved to its current location with a police and fire truck escort. The cord had to be cut to move the bulb, as the firefighters feared unscrewing the bulb would damage it. The Centennial Light originally produced 30-60 watts of light, but it currently runs on only four watts. ==References== Category:Lamps Category:California",
