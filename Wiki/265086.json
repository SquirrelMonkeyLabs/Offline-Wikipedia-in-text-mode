 "text": "Musette is the French word for small bellows played bagpipes. Some composers liked to use a drone (especially one in fifths) to make it sound like bagpipes or other folk instruments. Johann Sebastian Bach, Fran√ßois Couperin and other Baroque composers often called such pieces \"Musette\". Sometimes they did this in orchestral music: Joseph Haydn used a drone in the last part of his Symphony No. 104 to accompany a folk tune. ==Other websites== Category:Bagpipes",
