 "text": "A dependent territory, dependent area or dependency is a territory that is not fully independent or sovereign, and also not fully part of a independent country. As such, a dependent territory is included in such types of territories from associated states to non-self-governing territorys (for example, a colony). A dependent territory is commonly different from a subnational entity of which is considered to be not a part of the sovereign state nor its constituent part, instead, is understood a division of a state proper. A dependent territory often maintains some degree of autonomy not enjoyed by the administrative divisions of the country. Historically, most colonies were considered to be dependent territories. Not all autonomous polities are dependent territories, and not all dependent territories are autonomous. Most inhabited dependent territories have their own ISO 3166 code. Some polities inhabit positions taken from the treaty or other such agreement, thereby creating a such certain degree of autonomy (for example, a difference in immigration rules). Those entities are sometimes considered to be, or are at least grouped with, dependent territories, but are officially considered by their governing states to be an integral part of those states. Such as a example is Ã…land, a autonomous region of Finland. == Summary == The article include the following: === Dependent territories === * 1 dependency and 1 Antarctic claim, as well as two self-governing states are included in the listing for New Zealand * 1 uninhabited dependency and 2 dependency claims are included in the listing for Norway * 10 inhabited overseas territories, 2 overseas territories with no permanent population, 3 crown dependencies, 2 sovereign military bases and 1 Antarctic claim are included in the listing for United Kingdom * 5 inhabited territories and 9 islands with no permanent population are included in the number for the United States === Similar entities === * 6 external territories and 1 Antarctic claim are included in the listing for Australia * 2 special administrative regions are included in the listing for China * 2 autonomous territories are included in the listing for Denmark * 1 autonomous region is included in the listing for Finland * 5 overseas collectivities, 1 sui generis collectivity and 2 overseas territories are included in the listing for France * 3 autonomous territories are included in the listing for Netherlands * 1 unincorporated area is included in the listing for Norway == Lists of dependent territories == This list includes all territories that have not been legally incorporated into their governing state, including several territories that are not on the list of non-self- governing territories of the General Assembly of the United Nations.For the list, see Dependency claims without general international recognition, including all claims in Antarctica, are listed in italics. ===New Zealand=== Summary: New Zealand has one dependent territory (Tokelau) and a territorial claim in Antarctica, as well as two self-governing associated states.

These terms include overseas territories, crown dependencies, overseas possessions, unincorporated territories, and areas of special sovereignty. Crown dependencies are self-governing crown possessions, which the British government solely protects and represent at international levels. Unincorporated is a term that Americans used to refer to territories where the US Constitution only partially applies. France refers to its semi-autonomous territories as overseas collectivities while the Netherlands uses the phrase constituent countries to refer to its territories. There are 55 dependencies and territories, of which most of them are islands in the world's oceans. Although the British Empire no longer exists, the United Kingdom has the most dependencies or overseas territories. It has 17 unincorporated and dependent territories, including Gibraltar and Falkland Islands, and the United States also have sizeable numbers of dependencies, with some of the US-known territories including Puerto Rico and Guam. However, some dependent territories are affected by territorial disputes. A special case is Antarctica, where they made dependency claims here, including the overlap extent beetwen Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom ==References== ==Notes== Notes",
