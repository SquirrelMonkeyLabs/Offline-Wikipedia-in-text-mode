 "text": "Oxford Street is a major road in the City of Westminster in the West End of London. It is Europe's busiest shopping street, and has about 300 shops. Oxford Street was named Oxford street in 1729 and its 1.5 miles long. The street forms part of the A40 road, which connects London to Oxford. Like many roads in central London which are no longer through routes it is not signposted with the road number. Roughly halfway along Oxford Street is Oxford Circus, a busy intersection with Regent Street. A diagonal crossing at Oxford Circus opened in 2009, currently the only one of its kind in central London. == References == Category:Roads in London",
