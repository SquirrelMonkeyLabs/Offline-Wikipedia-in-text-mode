Washington Government Printing Office, 1902. Work on the light began in October 1893 but was halted by the Philippine Revolution in 1896. After the Philippine-American War, lighthouse construction was resumed by the new American government in the Philippines; and Bugui Point Lighthouse was lit on December 1, 1902. \"Faro De Punta Bugui\", as it was called during Spanish colonial times, is in Bugui Point, in the municipality of Aroroy, in the northwest point of the province of Masbate. The lighthouse's location, along the route from San Bernardino Strait going to Manila — also called the \"Southern Passage\" — was considered essential during the famed Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade (1565–1815). ==References== == Other websites == * Maritime Safety Services Command * Bugui Point Lighthouse: The Lonely Sentinel of Aroroy, Masbate Category:Bicol Region Category:Lighthouses of the Philippines",
