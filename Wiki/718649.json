 "text": "In the early hours of 23 October 2019, 39 dead bodies were found in a freight container in Grays, Essex, England. The lorry cab is owned by an Irish company. It had been registered Bulgaria, but had not been there since 2017. It travelled from the Netherlands through Belgium before arriving in the United Kingdom at Purfleet, Essex, from Zeebrugge. Investigations are ongoing in regard to how the lorry passed through security at the border. Investigations were led by the Essex Police, but made international by the end of the day. The lorry driver is a 25-year-old man from Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland. The Guardian reported that there are several photographs of him with the lorry cab involved in the incident on his Facebook page. He was arrested at the scene, on suspicion of murder. He drove it from Purfleet to Grays. ==References== Category:2019 crimes in Europe Category:2019 disasters in Europe Category:2019 in the United Kingdom Category:Crime in England Category:2010s disasters in the United Kingdom Category:Essex Category:October 2019 events",
