 "text": "The holiness movement is about certain of beliefs and practices that came from Methodism in the 19th-century. It also refers to some groups of evangelical Christianity who believe that these ideas are central doctrine. The movement is distinguished by its focus on John Wesley's teaching of \"Christian perfection\" . It says that it is possible to live free of sin, and specifically by the belief that this can be done instantly by preforming a second work of grace. ==Other websites== *How They Entered Canaan: A collection of holiness experience accounts by B.
