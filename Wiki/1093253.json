The soup is made with mutton and vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, chickpeas) in saffron water to add flavour and colour. It is covered by a lump of fat, and cooked in a sealed pot. Piti is served in the pot, usually with another plate for eating the meat apart from the liquid. They may be eaten separately as a first course (soup with veg.) and second (meat) course.
