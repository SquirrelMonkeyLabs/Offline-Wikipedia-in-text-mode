 "text": "January (Jan.) is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, coming between December (of the previous year) and February (of the current year). It has 31 days. January begins on the same day of the week as October in common years, and April and July in leap years. January ends on the same day of the week as February and October in common years, and July in leap years. == The Month == January is named for Janus, the Roman god of doors and gates. January and February were put on the calendar after all the other months. This is because in the original Roman calendar, winter did not have months. Although March was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls (Roman leaders). The month has 31 days. January is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of July in the other. Perihelion, the point in its orbit where the Earth is closest to the Sun, also occurs in this month, between January 2 and January 5. January is the only month of the year that always has a \"twin\" - a month that both begins and ends on the same day of the week as it does. In a common year, this is October, and in a leap year, July. January begins on the same day of the week as October in common years and on the same day of the week as April and July in leap years. January ends on the same day of the week as February and October in common years and on the same day of the week as July in leap years. Every year, January both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as May of the previous year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In common years immediately before other common years, January starts on the same day of the week as April and July of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, September and December of the following year. In common years immediately before other common years, January finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, April and December of the following year. January's flower is the carnation with its birthstone being the garnet. The first day of January is called New Year's Day. It is said that it became this date when Roman consuls took office on this day in 153 BC. Different calendars across Europe made this the start of the New Year at different times, as some observed it on March 25. Reaching over from December, the Christmas season in Christianity also extends into this month. Eastern churches celebrate Christmas on January 6 or January 7, and Epiphany on January 18 or January 19. In Western Christianity this occurs on January 6, with Christmas occurring on December 25. January 1 is celebrated the Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God, that is a feast day of precept of the Blessed Virgin Mary. == Events == === Fixed events === * January 1 - New Year's Day * January 1 - Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God * January 1 - World Day of Peace * January 1 - Founding Day (Republic of China) * January 1 - Independence Day in Brunei, Haiti and Sudan * January 1 - Triumph of the Revolution (Cuba) * January 1 - Constitution Day (Italy) * January 2 - New Year's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) * January 2 - Ancestry Day (Haiti) * January 2 - Berchtold's Day (Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Alsace) * January 3 - Statehood Day (Alaska) * January 4 - Independence Day (Burma) * January 4 - Day of the Fallen Against Colonial Repression (Angola) * January 4 - Day of the Martyrs (Democratic Republic of the Congo) * January 5 - Twelfth Night in Western Christianity, night to January 6 * January 6 - Epiphany in Western Christianity. * January 6 - Christmas in the Armenian Apostolic Church * January 7 - Christmas in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. * January 7 - Tricolour Day (Italy) * January 7 - Victory from Genocide Day (Cambodia) * January 8 - Commonwealth Day (Northern Mariana Islands) * January 8 - Celebration of Elvis Presley's birthday at Graceland * January 8 - Kim Jong-un's birthday (North Korea) * January 9 - Martyrs' Day (Panama) * January 11 - Kagami Biraki (Japan) * January 11 - Republic Day (Albania) * January 11 - Day of National Unity (Nepal) * January 12 - Memorial Day (Turkmenistan) * January 12 - National Youth Day (India) * January 12 - Zanzibar Revolution Day (Tanzania) * January 13 - Korean American Day * January 13 - Old New Year (parts of Eastern Europe) * January 13 - St. Knut's Day (Norway, Finland, Sweden) * January 14 - New Year's Day (Eastern Orothodox Church) * January 14 - National Flag Day in Georgia * January 14 - National Forest Conservation Day (Thailand) * January 15 - Armed Forces Day (Nigeria) * January 15 - Army Day (India) * January 15 - Tree Planting Day (Egypt) * January 16 - Teacher's Day (Thailand) * January 16 - Flag Day (Israel) * January 17 - Roman Catholic feast day of St. Anthony * January 18 - Royal Thai Armed Forces Day * January 18 - Revolution Day (Tunisia) * January 18 - World Religion Day * January 19 - Epiphany in Eastern Orthodox Christianity * January 20 - Armed Forces Day (Mali) * January 20 - Martyrs' Day (Azerbaijan) * January 20 - Inauguration Day (United States) - newly elected US president takes office in a year after a leap year (last in 2021, next in 2025) * January 21 - Flag Day (Quebec) * January 21 - Christian feast day of St. Agnes. * January 22 - Wellington Anniversary (New Zealand) * January 22 - Reunion Day (Ukraine) * January 23 - National Pie Day (United States) * January 23 - Bounty Day (Pitcairn Island) * January 24 - Feast Day of Our Lady of Peace (Roman Catholicism) * January 24 - Unification Day (Romania) * January 25 - Burns Night (Scotland and Scottish communities), celebrating the birthday of Scottish poet Robert Burns * January 25 - Dydd Santes Dwynwen (Welsh equivalent of Valentine's Day) * January 25 - National Voters Day (India) * January 25 - Tatiana Day (Russia) * January 26 - Australia Day * January 26 - Republic Day (India) * January 26 - Duarte Day (Dominican Republic) * January 26 - Liberation Day (Uganda) * January 27 - Holocaust Memorial Day * January 28 - Army Day (Armenia) * January 28 - EU Data Privacy Day * January 28 - Unofficial day commemorating Charlemagne by some Christians * January 30 - Martyrs' Day (India) * January 30 - School Day of Non-Violence and Peace (Spain) * January 31 - Independence Day (Nauru) === Month-long or moveable events === * Coming of Age Day (Japan), second Monday in January * Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (United States), third Monday in January, commemorating civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr., who was born on January 15. * Chinese New Year (between January 21 and February 21) * Australian Open - One of the major Grand Slam tennis tournaments.
