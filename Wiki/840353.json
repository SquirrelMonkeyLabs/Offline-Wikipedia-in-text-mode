 "text": "St Paul's Church is a Church of England proprietary chapel and conventional district in Hadley Wood, London. ==History== During World War I, the Church Room served as a canteen and recreation room for servicemen stationed in Hadley Wood and was also used for lectures and evening meetings. In 1999 the Bishop of London, the Rt Rev, and Rt Hon Richard Chartres constituted St Paul’s Church as a Conventional District which conferred the legal status of a parish and included the right to appoint an independent Minister. St Paul’s thus became operationally independent from 2000. On 11th November 2018, the ending of the Great War was marked by the unveiling of a Roll of Honour Board, crafted locally in English oak, to commemorate the local men who lost their lives in World Wars I and II. This was and remains the only war memorial in Hadley Wood. ==Present Day== St Paul’s Church currently belongs to the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, St Paul's Church began broadcasting its services online. ==References== Category:Anglican churches in England Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Enfield",
