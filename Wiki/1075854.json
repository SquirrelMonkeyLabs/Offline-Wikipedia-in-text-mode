 "text": "The Trump fake electors plot was a political scheme made by President Donald Trump who did not win the 2020 United States presidential election. His allies in seven states wanted to create and submit fake certificates of ascertainment that wrongly claimed Trump had won the electoral college vote in those states. The plan of the scheme was to pass the fake certificates and send to Washington, D.C. to pressure then Vice President Mike Pence in the hope he would count them as votes other than the real certificates to overturn Joe Biden's victory. This plot was made by Trump's attorney John Eastman. Eastman claimed the vice president has the power to change the electoral votes in the certification process and change the outcome of the the winner of the presidential race. By 2023, many people in several states had been sent to jail or forced to pay fines for their alleged involvement, with other investigations underway. == References == Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:Donald Trump Category:Republican Party (United States)",
