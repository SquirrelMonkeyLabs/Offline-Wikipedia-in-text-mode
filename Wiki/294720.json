They have been listed as one of Australia's outstanding national landscapes. The were named \"Flinders Range\" in 1839 by explorer Edward John Eyre who was searching for an overland route from Adelaide to Port Lincoln. The ranges were home to the Adnyamathanha, an indigenous Australian people, for thousands of years. Their paintings and rock carvings can be found throughout the area. A large area is protected by the Flinders Ranges National Park. Important towns in the Flinders Ranges include Hawker, Quorn, Wilpena Pound and Leigh Creek. ==References== Category:Mountains of South Australia Category:Mountain ranges of Australia",
