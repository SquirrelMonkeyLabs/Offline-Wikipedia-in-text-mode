 "text": "The Attack was a Twitch web show series, that would be edited as a gaming variety TV series that would air upon the launch of the D|XP block on July 31st, 2017, but would be cancelled on September 8th, 2017, due to declining ratings. The show was initially launched in 2014 after Kevin Pereira left Attack of the Show! on G4, and it was a show based off of said show (which would air for almost the network's entire original life and second incarnation.), which aired from March 28, 2005 to January 23, 2013, and from November 18, 2021, to October 21, 2022 when the G4 network shut down again due to declining ratings that year. == Synopsis == The show covered a variety of topics, including the day's biggest news, video game news, and viral videos. It was also known for exploring \"the darkest corners of the interwebs\" and presenting content that some viewers might find disturbing. == Cancellation == According to Polygon, the show faced challenges and ultimately closed down due to view-botting, a practice that artificially inflated viewer numbers, which is against Twitch's terms of service.
