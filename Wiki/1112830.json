 "text": "The Brontës () were a nineteenth-century literature family. They were born in Thornton. Later, they moved to Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The sisters, Charlotte (1816–1855), Emily (1818–1848) and Anne (1820–1849), are popular poets and writers. They could not use their own names when writing, because otherwise their works would not be taken seriously. They published their poems and novels under male names: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories had lots of passion and quickly became popular. Charlotte's Jane Eyre was the first of their popular books. Emily's Wuthering Heights, Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and other works became popular after their deaths. == Family tree == == References == Bibliography * * * (The English Novelists series) * * * *Hoare, Neil; Kathryn Sutherland Joan Winterkorn and Friends of the National Libraries (Great Britain). 2023.
