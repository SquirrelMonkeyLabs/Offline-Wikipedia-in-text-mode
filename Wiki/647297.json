 "text": "The Prime Minister of Croatia (), officially the President of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (), is Croatia's head of government, and is the de facto the most powerful and influential state officeholder in the Croatian government. In the formal Croatian order of precedence, however, the position of prime minister is the third highest state office, after the President of the Republic and the Speaker of the Parliament. The Constitution of Croatia describes the role as the \"Parliament supervises the Government\" (Article 81) and that \"the President of the Republic ensures the regular and balanced functioning and stability of government\" (as a whole; Article 94), while the Government is introduced in Article 108. The current Prime Minister of Croatia is Andrej Plenković. The Government of Croatia meets in Banski dvori, a historical building located on the west side of St. Mark's Square in Zagreb. ==Living former Prime Ministers== There are eleven living former Heads of government (3 former Presidents of the Executive Council of SR Croatia and 8 former Prime Ministers of Croatia). The last former head of government to die was Hrvoje Šarinić (1992-1993) on 21 July 2017.
