 "text": "Persian has been the official language of Pakistan until modern times. The modern region of Pakistan has been part of many Iranian empires and was ruled by the Turco-Mongol Mughal dynasty which adopted the Persian language as part of its elite strata. Many varieties of Persian including Dari had been the language of communication between the different ethnicities. In Pakistan, Persian has now become a minority language and had been replaced by Urdu by the British. Islamabad and Tehran maintain an active archival library in F-8. The library is named after a local poet and Pir Shah Ghareeb Nawaz and is the largest archive of Persian literature this side of the Indus. == References == Category:Languages of Pakistan",
