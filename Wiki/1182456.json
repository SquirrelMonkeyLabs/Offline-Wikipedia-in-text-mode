 "text": "In the South African Army, unit Langenhoven was an infantry unit with motors. It was a component of the Infantry Formation of the South African Army. Its position as a reserve unit was similar to that of a unit in the United States Army National Guard or the British Army Reserve today. At the start of World War II, the regiment was not fully staffed, therefore it was combined with the 11th and 12th Armoured Car Companies to become the 5th Armoured Car Regiment. After that, the 5th Armoured Car Regiment traveled to North Africa and reached Port Tewfik, Egypt. Because its members were assigned as reinforcement to units that had been depleted following the action at Sid Rezegh, the regiment did not directly participate in any more combat. However, the regiment volunteered to serve in Italy with the 6th South African Armoured Division.
