 "text": "The Columbus Crew (known from 2015 to 2021 as Columbus Crew SC, and briefly in 2021 as Columbus SC) are an American soccer team that plays in Major League Soccer in Columbus, Ohio. They started play in 1996, playing at Ohio Stadium on the campus of Ohio State University until opening the new Columbus Crew Stadium in 1999. That stadium would be renamed Mapfre Stadium in 2015 and Historic Crew Stadium in late 2020. The Crew played their first match at the new Lower.com Field on July 3, 2021. Shortly after the start of the 2021 season, the team announced a name change to Columbus SC. Fan reaction was extremely negative. On May 17, 2021, only a week after the change to Columbus SC, the team announced that it would return to the original name of Columbus Crew, without the \"SC\". ==Honors== * MLS Cup (league championship): 2 (2008, 2020) * MLS Supporters' Shield (best regular-season record): 3 (2004, 2008, 2009) * Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup: 1 (2002) ==League position== Season League Position 1996 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 1997 Major League Soccer Semifinals 1998 Major League Soccer Semifinals 1999 Major League Soccer Semifinals 2000 Major League Soccer 4th / Center 2001 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2002 Major League Soccer Semifinals 2003 Major League Soccer 5th / East 2004 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2005 Major League Soccer 6th / East 2006 Major League Soccer 6th / East 2007 Major League Soccer 6th / East 2008 Major League Soccer Champions 2009 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2010 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2011 Major League Soccer Wild Card 2012 Major League Soccer 6th / East 2013 Major League Soccer 8th / East 2014 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2015 Major League Soccer Finalist 2016 Major League Soccer 9th / East 2017 Major League Soccer Semifinals 2018 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2019 Major League Soccer 10th / East 2020 Major League Soccer Champions ==References== Category:American soccer teams Category:Columbus, Ohio Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:1994 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Ohio",
