She received her Ph.D. and joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1923. Benedict was president of the American Anthropological Association and also an important member of the American Folklore Society. She became the first woman to be a leader of an academic profession. Her 1934 book Patterns of Culture was about how personality, art, language, and culture all connect together. None of those things can be separate. She also wrote against racism during World War II and that all people should work together. Her later book, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, was about the society and culture of Japan. She researched it during the war without visiting Japan. She used literature, books, news articles and movies from Japan.
