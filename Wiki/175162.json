 "text": "Mount Redoubt, also called Redoubt Volcano, is a volcano in the U.S. state of Alaska. It rises above sea level and above the valleys around it. It is about from the city of Anchorage. On March 22, 2009, Mount Redoubt erupted, sending ash high in the air and covering the mountains around with ash. No people live near Mount Redoubt, but the ash spread into towns and cities and the airport of Anchorage was closed shortly. Other years when it erupted include 1902, 1922, 1966, and 1989. == Images == File:MountRedoubt.jpg|Mount Redoubt while it is not erupting.
