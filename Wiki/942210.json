 "text": "Osteocephalus mimeticus is a frog in the family Hylidae. It lives in the state of Amazonas in Brazil and the state of Amazonas in Venezuela. Scientists think it might also live in Colombia. This frog lives in forests with white sand in the ground. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 47.5 – 58.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 54.6–65.3 m long. Adult male frogs have many large bumps on their skin, and adult female frogs have small bumps. The adult frog is light brown, yellow-brown, or red-brown on the back. Some of them have dark brown or black marks. There is a dark stripe between the eyes. There is a dark line by each side of the jaw. The body's sides are yellow-white and may have brown spots or marks. The inner sections of the hind legs are light brown, and the belly is whitish. The lower sides of the legs are pink or orange. Young frogs are gray with darker gray marks. There is a gray stripe between the eyes. The tadpoles are 33.0 – 34.5 mm long from nose to the end of the tail. ==Threats== There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Humans cut down trees to use the wood and to make farms. Because this frog only lives in forests with white sand, this is a larger problem than it is for other frogs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
