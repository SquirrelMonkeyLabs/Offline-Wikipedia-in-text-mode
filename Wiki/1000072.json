In 2002, her Disobedience won the International Griffin Poetry Prize. As a woman poet, Notley has said that one of her goals was to think about \"subjects that hadn't been broached much in poetry and of how it seemed one had to disobey the past and the practices of literary males in order to talk about what was going on most literarily around one, the pregnant body, and babies for example. There were no babies in poetry then. How could that have been? What are we leaving out now?\" ==Books== *Alice Ordered Me To Be Made (1976) *Waltzing Matilda (1981) *Tell Me Again (1982) autobiography *The Descent of Alette (1992) *Mysteries of Small Houses (1998) *Disobedience (2001) *Coming After (2005) essays *Grave of Light: New and Selected Poems 1970–2005 (2006) *Songs and Stories of the Ghouls (2011) *Benediction (2015) *Certain Magical Acts (2016) *Eurynome’s Sandals (2019) *For the Ride (2020) == Related pages == *List of poets from North America ==References== ==Other websites== * Alice Notley at PennSound Category:1945 births Category:American poets Category:Writers from Arizona Category:2025 deaths",
