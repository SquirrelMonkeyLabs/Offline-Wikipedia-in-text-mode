She is best known for her role of Becca in the 2007 teen comedy Superbad. == Early life == MacIsaac was born and raised in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the youngest of three girls; her mother Irene was one of twelve. == Career == MacIsaac started her career playing Emily Byrd Starr in the Emily of New Moon television series, based on the books by Lucy Maud Montgomery. She has appeared in several plays including the 2006 play The Wild Duck in which she played Hedwig and was nominated for a Dora Mavor Moore Award for \"Outstanding Performance by a Female in a Principal Role - Play\". In 2009, she played Paige in a remake of the Wes Craven film The Last House on the Left. She also performed in three consecutive productions of Soulpepper Theatre Company's Our Town as Emily, beginning in 2006. In a 2007 Entertainment Weekly article, she stated she has been inspired by Julia Roberts from the age of four and was self-described as \"obsessed\". She also stated she would like to perform alongside her in a film, particularly \"a female version of Twins\". In late 2012, MacIsaac began a main role on the NBC comedy 1600 Penn as the president's eldest daughter, Becca. Brittany Snow was originally cast as Becca but because she did not physically resemble and fit in well with the other family members, Martha MacIsaac was cast. In a 2012 interview with the CBC Radio series Island Morning, she revealed that 1600 Penn was her last audition before she considered returning to Canada. == Personal life == She was married to film producer, director, and writer Torre Catalano from 2010 to 2015. She lives in Los Angeles, California as of 2017. She is represented by the Agency for the Performing Arts. == Filmography == Film Year Title Role Notes 2003 This Time Around Young Gabby Castellani Film Debut 2004 Suburban Madness Vivian Leigh Bacha 2005 Ice Princess Mean Party Girl 2005 I Do, They Don't Moira Lewellyn 2006 Night of Terror Olivia Dunne 2007 Superbad Becca 2007 In God's Country Charlotte 2009 Paige 2009 Evelyn 2010 Faith, Fraud & Minimum Wage Casey McCullen 2012 For a Good Time, Call...
