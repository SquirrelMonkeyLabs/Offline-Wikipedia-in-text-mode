 "text": "The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) is a technoligical experiment from NASA using the NASA Mars 2020 rover Perseverance trying to find out if oxygen can be created on Mars by using carbon dioxide. On April 20, 2021, MOXIE produced oxygen from carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere by using solid oxide electrolysis. This was the first experimental extraction of a natural resource from another planet for human use. The technology may help a possible human mission to the planet to provide breathable oxygen. ==References== Category:April 2021 events Category:Mars",
