 "text": "A possessive case is a word or form used to show possession in linguistics. For example, \"Ray's bike\" means he owns it. Most European languages have possessive forms of personal pronouns, like the English my, mine, your, yours, his and so on. There are two main ways these can be used: * Together with a noun, as in my car, your sisters, his boss. * Without a noun, as in mine is red, I prefer yours, this book is his. * Its is the neutral possessive case: The cat chased its tail. Not it's, which is a contraction of it is. Category:Linguistics Category:Pronouns",
