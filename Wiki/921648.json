In 2020, 43,959 people lived there. ==History== Prior to the founding of Campbell, the land was occupied by the Ohlone, the Native American people of the Northern California coast. About a third of present-day Campbell was part of the 1839 Alta California Rancho Rinconada de Los Gatos land grant. The city was founded by Benjamin Campbell, after whom the city is named. The area became the center for shipping fruit grown in the surrounding area, and within a short time, the drying grounds and canneries made Campbell an important rail center. == References == Category:1950s establishments in California Category:1952 establishments in the United States Category:Cities in California Category:Cities in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Settlements in Santa Clara County, California",
