The movie stars Eliza Dushku, Mike Vogel, Naike Rivelli, and Lindsay Robba. ==Plot== In the medieval era, a witch named Mamba was tortured and skinned alive as punishment for her crimes. Her skin and organs were then used to make a cursed game. The player who wins the game is granted a wish; however, the player who loses the game is killed in a way which is chosen by the game. In present day, Jason gets the board game from a disabled shop owner called Malek. After rain made his friend Tomas' beachhouse party to end, another partygoer, Erica, suggests that the remaining friends—including Jason, Tomas, Tomas' girlfriend Lisa, Elena, Miguel, Pablo—play the game. Pablo loses and takes Tomas' car to get a beer. He falls off a cliff and a group of crabs attacks him, attacking out his eyes and killing him. Miguel, Lisa, Elena, and Tomas also loses the game, before Detective Izar arrives and tells the group of Pablo's death, ending the game short. The group attends Pablo's funeral, where Erica realizes that his death mirrors the game's choice. Tomas, Lisa, and Miguel travel to Miguel's family's empty wood-cutting factory to have a photo shoot. Lisa begins to feel unwell and left with Tomas. Alone, Miguel falls into a group of snakes that kills him. Jason and Erica starts a romance. While they were in Jason's car, they see ghostly forms of Pablo and Miguel, before learning about Miguel's death. They meet Tomas, Lisa, and Elena and explain that they suspect that the friends are dying because of the game. Lisa becomes more ill; the following morning, she had turned into an old woman and is rushed to the hospital. Jason, Erica, and Elena tell Detective Izar their theory about the game. Lisa soon dies, causing Jason, Erica, and Tomas to look for answers from Malek. They find Malek at his home, but he is no longer disabled. He explains that he won the game and wished to no longer be disabled. Meanwhile, Elena is traveling home when she is involved in a car accident and burns to death. Jason, Erica, and Tomas go to Jason's house, where they find Detective Izar looking for the game. Jason and Erica escaped with it, but Tomas is caught by the detective. When he attempts to escape, the detective shoots him dead. At Tomas' beachfront house, Jason and Erica decide to play the game in the hope that they can win and wish for it to be a week in the past so that their friends will be alive again. Erica is eliminated and realizes that her death will involve the sea. Jason wins and will get his wish as long as he passes the game on to another person. Erica discovers that she must die for Jason to get his wish, so she enters the sea. Jason rushes out to save her, but Detective Izar shows up and leaves with the game. Erica emerges from the sea and reveals herself to be Mamba, granting Jason his wish that they never played the game. However, Jason and his friends end up trapped in an endless time loop as a result of his wish, forced to relive the week again and again. ==Cast== ==References== Category:2009 horror movies Category:American horror movies Category:Spanish horror movies",
