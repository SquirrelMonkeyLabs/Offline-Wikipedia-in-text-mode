 "text": "An air force is the branch of a country's military which fights in the air. The air force is made up of aircraft such as fighters, bombers, helicopters, and transport aircraft. When a navy has its own air force, it is called Naval Aviation. Air forces began in the early 20th century, usually as part of a country's army. Most countries separated their air forces in the 1930s and 1940s. Aircraft in an air force sometimes fly in a formation in which the aircraft fly in a pattern. The biggest air force in the world is the United States Air Force (USAF), followed by the United States Navy and the Russian Air Force. ==References==",
