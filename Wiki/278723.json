 "text": "Candida albicans is a yeast which causes oral and genital infections in humans. The infection is candidiasis, better known as \"thrush\". It is treated with antimycotics (anti-fungal drugs). C. albicans biofilms readily form on the surface of medical devices. Hospital-related infections in patients are a major health concern. C. albicans is among the gut flora, the many organisms that live in the human mouth and gastrointestinal tract. Under normal circumstances, it lives in 80% of the human population with no harmful effects, although overgrowth results in candidiasis.
