 "text": "The history of Andhradesa, Southern Kosala, and Baghelkhand during the reign of Pravarasena I is not fully clear. The Ikshvakuu of Andhradesa stopped ruling around 290 A.D., and the Salankayana took over about 40 years later. The Nalas of Chhattisgarh and Bastar rose to power even later. It is uncertain if Pravarasena took advantage of the lack of strong rulers in the region and brought it under his control. However, it is possible that he did and appointed his third son to rule the area. Notably, smaller rulers in Baghelkhand, like Vyaghra Raja of Ganj, continued to accept Vakataka rule even during the reign of Prithvisena I (360-385 A.D.), who is not credited with conquering this region. This suggests that Pravarasena may have expanded his influence over parts of Baghelkhand and Chhattisgarh. Additionally, the Saka rulers of Gujarat and Kathiawar, who were north-western neighbors of Pravarasena, were likely brought under his suzerainty during the early 4th century. ==Related Pages== *Vakataka Conquest of Malwa *Conquests of Harishena *Kumaragupta's Deccan Campaign == References == Category:India",
