 "text": "Ptolemy XIV Philopator was the pharaoh of Egypt, who ruled with his sister Cleopatra VII from 47 until his death in 44 BC. == Biography == When Ptolemy XIII died in 47 BC, his younger brother Ptolemy XIV became Pharaoh with the help of his older sister Cleopatra. Ptolemy XIV was around 12 years old when he became king. Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIV were married, but she was still the lover of Julius Caesar. Some people think that Cleopatra had power and Ptolemy XIV was just a puppet king because of Egyptian tradition. After Julius Caesar was murdered in Rome in 44 BC, Ptolemy XIV died too. It's not clear if Cleopatra killed him, but some people think she did it with poison made from aconite because she wanted her son Caesarion, who was born from her relationship with Julius Caesar, to be the next king. Cleopatra made Caesarion her co-ruler on September 2, 44 BC. == Family tree == == References == == Other websties == * Ptolemy XIV Theos Philopator II entry in historical sourcebook by Mahlon H.
