 "text": "A cold cathode is a cathode (a type of electrode) that is not heated directly by a filament or element, although a cold cathode can heat up during use as a side effect of normal current flow. The term cold cathode is often used to refer to cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs), which are often used where a long life is needed. Applications for cold cathode lamps include general lighting, backlights for LCD TVs and computer monitors, and artistic lighting such as computer case mods and automotive customization.
