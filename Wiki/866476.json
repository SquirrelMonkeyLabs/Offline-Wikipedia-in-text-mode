Japan Meteorological Agency named this typhoon Reiwa 1 East Japan Typhoon (令和元年東日本台風). Due to the severe impacts of Typhoon Hagibis in Japan, the name Hagibis was officially retired during the 52nd Annual Session, organized by the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in February 2020. In February 2021, the Typhoon Committee subsequently chose Ragasa as its replacement name. == References == * 台風201919号 (HAGIBIS) [令和元年東日本台風 - 災害情報] - National Institute of Informatics * 令和元年東日本台風 (台風第19号) による大雨、暴風等 - Japan Meteorological Agency Category:2019 Pacific typhoon season Category:October 2019 events Category:Retired tropical cyclone names",
