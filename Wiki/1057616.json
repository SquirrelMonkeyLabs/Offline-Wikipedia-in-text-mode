 "text": "The WAGR I class were 3 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1891 to 1900. The WAGR I class were initially built for New Zealand Railways (NZR) in 1880 by the Avonside Engine Coy of Bristol, England as the NZR S class. By 1891 the Eastern Railway's (ER) motive power was in such a state with British manufacturers taking so long to produce locomotives that the Engineer-in-Chief of the ER, C. Y. O'Connor essentially begged the NZR for stock. As a favour, the NZR sold three of their S class Nos—215 - 217 to the WAGR, becoming Nos—25 - 27. By 1900 the motive power shortage had reclined and the I class became surplus to requirements with all three locos withdrawn that year and scrapped.
