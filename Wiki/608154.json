 "text": "The ham sandwich theorem is a math theorem that says that a number of objects in the same number of dimension can be cut into two equal parts with a cut that is one dimension less. == Examples == === One dimension === One dimension is a line. A section of the line can be cut exactly in half with a single point. === Two dimensions === Two dimensions is a flat sheet. Two shapes on this sheet can be cut exactly in half with a single line. === Three dimensions === Three dimensions is space. Three objects in space can be cut exactly in half with a single flat sheet. === Four dimensions === Four dimensions is a hyperspace. Four hyper-objects can be cut exactly in half with a single space. == Name == The theorem is called the ham sandwich theorem because a sandwich with bread, cheese, and ham consists of three ingredients and lies in three- dimensional space. Thanks to the ham sandwich theorem it is possible to make one cut with a knife to divide the bread, the cheese, and the ham fairly between both sides. Category:Theorems in geometry",
