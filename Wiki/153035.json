 "text": "Structural engineering is a subset of civil engineering dealing with the design and analysis of buildings and large non-building structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters. Besides, it may also cover design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved. Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes. Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages: research, design, testing, and construction which are featured with the images below: File:EPET print out.jpg File:Multi-Frequency Quieting Building System.jpg File:2009 03 03 Pearl River Tower.jpg Structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century. Entry- level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure, for example, beams, columns, and floors of a building. More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building. Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields, such as bridge engineering, building engineering, pipeline engineering, earthquake engineering, industrial structures, or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts. ==Related pages== * Architecture * Building model == Notes == Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Civil engineering Category:Buildings and structures",
