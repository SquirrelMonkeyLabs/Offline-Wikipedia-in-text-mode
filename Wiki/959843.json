 "text": "Megastomatohyla is a genus of frogs. It is in in the family Hylidae. They live in cloud forests in Mexico. It lives in the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca. All of the species in this genus are rare and only live in a few places. The name \"Megastomatohyla\" comes from the Greek word mega for \"large\" and stomatos for \"mouth,\" because the tadpoles have large mouths. Hyla is the name of another genus. Four of the frogs in Megastomatohyla were in Hyla before the scientists changed their minds. They are called large-mouthed treefrogs in English. ==Taxonomy and characteristics== In 2005, scientists looked closely at the family Hylidae and the frogs in it. They changed the genuses and groupings. Scientists looked at molecular data and decided to make Megastomatohyla a genus. Before that, these frogs were called the \"Hyla mixomaculata group.\" These frogs have only look similar in one way that people can see with their eyes: The tadpoles have a very large oral disk with many teeth: 7–10 rows of teeth in front and 10–11 rows of teeth in the back. Megastomatohyla are small frogs. They lay their eggs in streams. The largest frog in Megastomatohyla is about long from nose to rear end. Males do not sing for the females and they do not have vocal slits. They do not have nuptial pads on their thumbs. The eardrum is not visible. The front feet have only a little webbed skin, and the back feet have more webbed skin. ==Species== The genus had four species in it: Binomial name and author Common name M. mixe Mixe tree frog M. mixomaculata variegated tree frog M. nubicola cloud forest tree frog M. pellita Oaxacan yellow tree frog ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
