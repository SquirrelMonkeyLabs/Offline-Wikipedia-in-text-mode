It is located on Praed Street to the south of Paddington mainline station and has entrances from Praed Street and from inside the mainline train station. On the Bakerloo line the station is between Warwick Avenue and Edgware Road and on the Circle and District lines it is between Bayswater and Edgware Road. It is in London Fare Zone 1. The station can be divided in two parts: underground platforms, opened in 1868 and deep-level platforms, opened in 1913. It is one of two separate Underground stations of the same name. The other station, to the north of the mainline station, is in the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked and exchange between them is via the merge of the mainline station. == References == ==Other websites== * London Transport Museum Photographic Archive ** ** ** ** ** Category:Rail transport stations in London fare zone 1 Category:Bakerloo line stations Category:Circle line stations Category:District line stations Category:Tube stations in the City of Westminster Category:Railway stations opened in 1868 Category:1868 establishments in the United Kingdom",
