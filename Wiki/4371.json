Numbers: their history and meaning. Courier Dover. It is a base-ten place-value system. This system has ten basic lowercase-only symbols, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system was first created by the Indians in the 6th century and used by the Arabs in the 7th century and Romans in the 16th century. In Europe, Hindu- Arabic numeral system became very popular after the publication of Liber Abaci, a book written by Italian mathematician Fibonacci. They are very different from previous methods of counting, such as the abacus. The numbers allowed mathematics to develop. In the past, many other number systems had been used.Menninger, Karl 1969.
