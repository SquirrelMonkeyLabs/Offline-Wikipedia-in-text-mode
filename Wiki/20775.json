The mountain was formed 1.2 million years ago and is made of lava. It is not known to have been active in thousands of years, but it could be active again. If it did, it could cause problems for people who live nearby. There are teams that are prepared to help people if Mount Price becomes active. == Other websites == *Mount Price information from Natural Resources Canada Category:Volcanoes of British Columbia Category:Mountains of British Columbia",
