 "text": "The Northlands Coliseum is a sports arena in Edmonton, Alberta. The arena opened on November 10, 1974, and is the former home to the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL) and the Edmonton Rush of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The arena was originally known as Northlands Coliseum from 1974 to 1995, Edmonton Coliseum from 1995 to 1998 and the Skyreach Centre from 1998 to 2003, and Rexall Place from 2003 until 2016. The arena returned to the Northlands Coliseum name after Rexall's rights ran out. The arena has hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1978 as well as WWE's Backlash pay-per-view in 2004. The 2015–16 season was the last for the Oilers at Rexall Place. In 2014, construction started on a new arena for the Oilers in downtown Edmonton. The new arena would be known as Rogers Place and opened in the 2016–17 season. The arena is expected to be demolished in 2025. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:1974 establishments in North America Category:1970s establishments in Canada Category:Edmonton Oilers Category:Indoor arenas Category:Sports buildings in Canada",
