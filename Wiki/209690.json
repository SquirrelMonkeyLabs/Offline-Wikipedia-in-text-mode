 "text": "Song of the South is a movie produced by Walt Disney. It was released on November 12, 1946, by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the Uncle Remus stories written by Joel Chandler Harris. Song of the South has never been fully released on home video in the USA because of content which some people could see as racism towards black people and is thus subject to rumors. However, a song from the movie, Zip a Dee Doo Dah, is very popular and there is a ride based on the movie at various Disney theme parks, though it was recently announced that it will be changed to a ride based on The Princess and the Frog as a result of the George Floyd protests. The movie only got a home video release internationally. This makes Song of the South the only Disney movie to not be released on North American home video. ==References== Category:1946 movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Disney animated movies Category:Movies that won the Best Original Song Academy Award Category:Movies directed by Wilfred Jackson Category:Movies about children Category:Movies about rabbits and hares Category:Movies about bears Category:1940s American musical movies Category:1940s American drama movies Category:African-American movies Category:Movies set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Movies set in the 1870s Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:1946 comedy movies Category:1940s comedy-drama movies",
