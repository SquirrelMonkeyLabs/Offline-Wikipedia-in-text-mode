 "text": "Roden is a community in the Main-Spessart district in the Regierungsbezirk of Lower Franconia (Unterfranken) in Bavaria, Germany and a member of the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (Administrative Community) of Marktheidenfeld. ==Geography== ===Location=== Roden is between Aschaffenburg (52 km) and Würzburg (32 km) on the edge of the Spessart (range). To Karlstadt am Main (the district seat) it is 15 km and to Lohr am Main the same. From the Autobahn A 3 (Frankfurt - Würzburg), Roden can be reached through the Marktheidenfeld interchange (no. 65), and thence to Marktheidenfeld and across the Main Bridge there. A left turn at the far end of the bridge brings drivers to Roden after 7 km. The community is rich in woodland (about 1 000 ha) at the line between the Spessart's mostly bunter-based geology and that found on the Fränkische Platte (a flat, mostly agricultural region), which is mostly Muschelkalk-based. ===Constituent communities=== The community is made up of the two centres of Roden and Ansbach. ==References== ==Other websites== *Community’s official webpage Category:Main-Spessart",
