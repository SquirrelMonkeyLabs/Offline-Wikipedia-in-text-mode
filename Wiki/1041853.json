The plan was found out, and he was arrested. Together, with the other leaders of the rebellion, he was executed. Two slaves who did not agree with Vesey’s plans told the authorities. They charged 131 people of conspiring. 67 were convicted. 35 were hanged. One of those was Denmark Vesey. Category:1767 births Category:1822 deaths Category:African-American people Category:Slaves",
