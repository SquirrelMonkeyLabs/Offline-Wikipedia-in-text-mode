 "text": "Hate speech is communicating in a way that is meant to offend and hurt somebody. It is usually based on a factor such as somebody's race, gender, ethnic group, orientation, identity, disability or religion. Some places have laws that make it illegal to use hate speech. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\" Countries such as Canada, France and Germany have stricter laws against hate speech than the United States, where hate speech is usually legal because its Constitution says that people have freedom of speech. == Related pages == * Ad hominem * Divide and conquer * Identity politics * Psychological warfare * Red herring * Smear campaign ==References== Category:Discrimination Category:Hatred",
