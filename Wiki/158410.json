 "text": "Shenandoah is a city in Iowa in the United States. Shortly after the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad arrived in the area, Shenandoah—originally called Fair Oaks—was platted in 1870. The local valley's likeness to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley is the source of its name. Shenandoah experienced a smallpox outbreak in 1885, which led to the closure of schools and the postponement of public gatherings and church services. Guards were stationed outside of smallpox-affected residences, and quarantine orders were created for those households. J.C. Wilson worked as a quarantine officer on June 11. W.F. Strong, a Shenandoah musician, wrote the piano arrangement \"Quarantine Polka\" during this period. Category:Cities in Iowa",
