 "text": "A spokesman (spokesperson or spokeswoman), or spokesmodel is a person who speaks on behalf of others, but is understood not to be necessarily part of the others (e.g. hired to represent the others). A spokesperson's job is to faithfully (with good intentions) represent and promote for how the organization will run, even if he/she does not agree with the organization's opinions. Because of this, spokespeople are normally people who are highly experienced employees, or people who have been supporting the organization's goals for a long time. == References == Category:Occupations",
