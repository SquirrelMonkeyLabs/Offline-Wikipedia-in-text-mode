 "text": "The Third Division North was the 3rd division of the English football league system between 1921 to 1958. It ran along with the Third Division South, with clubs being either elected to the League or relegated from a higher division allocated to either league based on their geographical location. Some clubs in the English Midlands shuffled between the Third Division North and the Third Division South based on the composition of the two leagues. Its final season was the 1957â€“58 season. After that season, the North and South sections were merged to form the Third Division and the Fourth Division. ==Founding clubs== *Accrington Stanley *Ashington *Barrow *Chesterfield *Crewe Alexandra *Darlington *Durham City *Grimsby Town *Halifax Town *Hartlepools United *Lincoln City *Nelson *Rochdale *Southport *Stalybridge Celtic *Stockport County *Tranmere Rovers *Walsall *Wigan Borough *Wrexham ==Champions== ==Related pages== * Football League Third Division South * Football League Third Division Category:Football in England Category:English Football League",
