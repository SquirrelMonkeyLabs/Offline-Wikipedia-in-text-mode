 "text": "The \"Miracle on Ice\" was a medal-round game during the men's ice hockey tournament at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. It played between the hosting United States and the four-time defending gold medalists, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and they were the favorites to win again in Lake Placid. For the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. Finishing the first period tied at 2–2, and the Soviets leading 3–2 following the second, the U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead midway in the third and final period, then held on and won 4–3. Two days later, the U.S. won the gold medal by beating Finland in their final game. The Soviet Union took the silver medal by beating Sweden. The victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports. In 1999, Sports Illustrated named the \"Miracle on Ice\" the top sports moment of the 20th century. ==References== Category:1980 in the United States",
