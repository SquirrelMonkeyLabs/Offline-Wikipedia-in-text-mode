He also proposed using nuclear explosions to propel rockets, and he developed several mathematical tools in number theory, set theory, ergodic theory and algebraic topology. Above all, he is known by being a coauthor (with Nicholas Metropolis) of the Monte Carlo algorithm. Ulam was of Jewish descent.Understanding the Cold War: a historian's personal reflections, Adam Bruno Ulam, Transaction Publishers, 2002 == References == Category:1909 births Category:1984 deaths Category:American mathematicians Category:Jewish American academics Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Polish Jews",
