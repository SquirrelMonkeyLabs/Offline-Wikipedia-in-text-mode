The Belize Barrier Reef is a long section of the long Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The reef system runs continuous from Cancún on the northeast tip of the Yucatán Peninsula through the Riviera Maya down to Honduras. This makes it one of the largest coral reef systems in the world, after the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the New Caledonia Barrier Reef. Charles Darwin described it as \"the most remarkable reef in the West Indies\" in 1842.Darwin, Charles 1842. The structure and distribution of coral reefs.
