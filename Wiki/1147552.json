 "text": "Mertens' rocket frog (Colostethus mertensi) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground near cloud forests. Scientists saw the frog between 2100 and 2350 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Munchique National Park. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to ponds of water that dry up for part of the year, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Humans cut down the forests to make farms, for example eucalyptus farms and illegal farms, to get wood to build with, and to make places for people to live. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
