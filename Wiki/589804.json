 "text": "Léopold Sédar Senghor (9 October 1906 – 20 December 2001) was a Senegalese poet, politician, and cultural theorist. He was the first president of Senegal (1960-80). He was part of the Négritude movement. Some people called him an African socialist, but many Senegalese socialists thought he was not really socialist because he was supported by France and put communists in Senegal in jail. He also started the Senegalese Democratic Bloc party. Senghor was the first African allowed to join the Académie française. Many people think he is one of the most important intellectuals from Africa during the 20th century. ==References== ==Other websites== * Biography and guide to collected works: African Studies Centre, Leiden * Histoire des Signares de Gorée du 17ie au 19ie siécle.
