 "text": "The coastal rocket frog (Allobates bromelicola) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog lives in trees and is awake during the day. This frog lives in bromeliad plants high in the trees. Scientists saw the frog between 1310 and 1375 meters above sea level. Scientists think that this frog could live in Henri Pittier National Park. ==Young== Scientists saw tadpoles swimming in the water inside bromeliad plants. They think the female frog lays her eggs in or on the bromeliad plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. They think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could infect this frog. It causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Scientists are not sure if the fungus can infect the frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
