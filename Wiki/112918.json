 "text": "The Dutch East Indies, or Netherlands East Indies, was the Dutch colony that is now modern Indonesia and the Malacca state of Malaysia. The main city was Batavia, now called Jakarta. It was made from the colonies of the Dutch East India Company that came under the control of the Netherlands in 1800. In the Java War (1741â€“1743), Chinese rebels worked with Javanese Muslim rebels who forcibly circumcised Dutch men and enslaved Dutch women and children. During World War II it was part of the Japanese Empire. In 1945 the Japanese had surrendered their colonies in the pacific, thus losing control of Indonesia, and Indonesian leaders made a declaration of independence. They fought a war of independence until the Netherlands gave Indonesia sovereignty in December 1949. == References == Category:1949 disestablishments in Asia Category:History of Indonesia Category:History of the Netherlands Category:States and territories disestablished in the 20th century Category:Dutch Empire Category:Former colonies in Asia",
