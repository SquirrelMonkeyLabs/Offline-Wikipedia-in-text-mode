It was conducted by the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ). The incumbent Liberal National government, led by Premier Campbell Newman, tried to win a second term in government. It lost to the Labor Party, led by Annastacia Palaszczuk, after Labor won a minority government. The LNP lost its supermajority and Newman lost his own seat of Ashgrove. Palaszczuk became the second woman to win a state election in Australia, after Anna Bligh (also from Queensland). ==References== Category:Elections in Queensland Category:2015 elections Category:2015 in Australia Category:2010s in Queensland Category:January 2015 events",
