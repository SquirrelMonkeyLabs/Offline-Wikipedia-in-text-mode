The Parade of Nations took place on the Champs-Élysées starting at the Arc de Triomphe and ending at Place de la Concorde. === Sports === The programme for the 2024 Summer Paralympics was announced in January 2019, with no changes to the 22 sports from the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The IPC considered bids for golf, karate, para dance sport, and powerchair football to be added to the Paralympic programme as new sports. Bids were also made for CP football (football 7-a-side) and sailing—the two sports that had been dropped for 2020—to be reinstated. While CP football was selected for consideration by the IPC, it was rejected due to a lack of reach in women's participation. * Archery () (9) * Athletics () (164) * Badminton () (16) * Boccia () (11) * Cycling () (51) ** Road (34) ** Track (17) * Equestrian () (11) * Football 5-a-side () (1) * Goalball () (2) * Judo () (16) * Paracanoe () (10) * Paratriathlon () (11) * Powerlifting () (20) * Rowing () (5) * Shooting () (13) * Sitting volleyball () (2) * Swimming () (141) * Table tennis () (31) * Taekwondo () (10) * Wheelchair basketball () (2) * Wheelchair fencing () (16) * Wheelchair rugby () (1) * Wheelchair tennis () (6) Source: ===Podium sweeps=== Date Sport Event Team Gold Silver Bronze Ref 3 September Swimming Men's 50 metre backstroke S5 Yuan Weiyi Guo Jincheng Wang Lichao 3 September Swimming Women's 50 metre backstroke S5 Lu Dong He Shenggao Liu Yu == Participating National Paralympic Committees == The following is a list of National Paralympic Committees who have at least one athlete who has qualified for the 2024 Paralympics.
