The song is about how a person can end up changing, losing their individuality and conforming to be like everybody else. During an interview with MTV, drummer John Dolmayan said: \"It's a gentle song, but at the same time, it has a lot of angst coming out. It was one of those things where it was just instant. We all felt it. It came together real fast, like it was meant to be put together that day.\" A music video for the song was released. It was directed by David Slade and Shavo Odadjian. The video begins on a empty, dusty planet. Inside a tent is a family with a deformed young boy. In th next scene, the boy seems to be a celebrity with his face on billboards and hanging out with women and lowriders. He talks to the paparazzi and goes to a photo shoot. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2002 songs Category:System of a Down songs Category:Hard rock songs",
