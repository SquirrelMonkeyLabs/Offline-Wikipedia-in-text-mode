 "text": "The Whigs were a political party in the parliaments of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. The Whigs' start was in constitutional monarchism and disagreement with absolute monarchy. Between the 1680s and 1850s, they tried to win power over their rivals, the Tories. The British prime minister was usually from one of the two parties. The Whigs played a central role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and were the enemies of the Stuart kings and pretenders, who were Roman Catholic. The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715. They held it until King George III, coming to the throne in 1760, allowed Tories back in.Brewer, John 1981.
