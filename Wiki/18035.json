 "text": "Johnston Atoll is an island in the Pacific Ocean. It is a property of the United States. The military used the Island for many things including a re- fueling location for planes going overseas, a chemical weapons ammunition storage facility, and a test launch location for nuclear testing. It was inhabited by all forces of the US military and government contract workers. The island is named after Captain James Johnston, who discovered it in 1807. The island was mined for guano until 1890. After that, it was used as an army base. == Other websites == *Johnston Island Memories Site, the personal website of an AFRTS serviceman stationed there in 1975-6 *Coast Guard Medevac from Johnston Island , photo from December 2007 medevac operation *JACADS - Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System, history of nuclear testing, and JACADS Sarin and VX nerve agent disposal *U.S. Fish & Wildlife Johnston Island National Wildlife Refuge Contains additional information on wildlife and clean-up efforts Category:Atolls Category:United States Minor Outlying Islands Category:Pacific islands Category:Islands of Oceania",
