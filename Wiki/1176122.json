 "text": "Navarro-Aragonese was a Romance language once spoken in a large part of the Ebro River basin, south of the middle Pyrenees; the dialects of the modern Aragonese language, spoken in a small portion of that territory, can be seen as its last remaining forms. The areas where Navarro-Aragonese was spoken might have included most of Aragon, southern Navarre, and La Rioja. It was also spoken across several towns of central Navarre in a multilingual environment with Occitan, where Basque was the native language. Navarro- Aragonese gradually lost ground throughout most of its geographic area to Castilian (i.e. Spanish), with its last remnants being the dialects of the Aragonese language still spoken in northern Aragon.
