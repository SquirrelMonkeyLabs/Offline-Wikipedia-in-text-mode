 "text": "The Hyundai Dynasty is a premium executive sedan produced by Hyundai Motor Company. It was first introduced in 1996 and was in production until 2005. The Dynasty featured luxury features and was positioned as a top-level flagship model. == History and Features == The Hyundai Dynasty debuted in 1996 as a high-end sedan aimed at the premium market. It was built on the Hyundai Y3 platform, which it shared with the smaller Hyundai Grandeur. To tell the Dynasty apart from the Grandeur, Hyundai used a different logo with the letter \"D\" on it. The Dynasty was produced in South Korea at Hyundai's Ulsan plant. It offered various engine options, including a 2.5L V6, 3.0L V6, and 3.5L V6 engine. The model was available in both standard and long-wheelbase (LWB) versions. The Dynasty was positioned as Hyundai’s flagship vehicle upon its introduction but lost its top-tier status after the launch of the Hyundai Equus in 1999. The Hyundai Dynasty featured a front-wheel-drive layout and was equipped with a range of luxury features, including electronically controlled suspension, dual climate control, and power memory seats for both the front and rear. == Markets == The Hyundai Dynasty was sold exclusively in South Korea during its entire production in Ulsan. == Discontinuation == Production of the Hyundai Dynasty ended in 2005, after which the Hyundai Aslan. took over the segment once occupied by the Dynasty. The Dynasty was succeeded by the Hyundai Aslan, which was marketed as the brand’s new premium sedan. The introduction of the rear-drive Hyundai Genesis also further diminished the Dynasty’s market position. == References == Dynasty Category:Sedans Category:1990s automobiles Category:2000s automobiles",
