 "text": "Zeolites are microporous, aluminosilicate minerals. It is commonly used as commercial absorbants and catalysts. The name zeolite was given in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. He called the material zeolite, from the Greek ζέω (zéō), meaning \"to boil\" and λίθος (líthos), meaning \"stone\". ==Occurrence== Natural zeolites form where volcanic rocks and ash react with alkaline groundwater. Zeolites found in nature are almost never pure. They are contaminated by other minerals, metals, quartz, or other zeolites. == Uses == Zeolites can be used in domestic and commercial water purification, water softening, and other uses. Zeolites were also found to help silver naturally emit light, which may compete with fluorescent lights or LEDs. Zeolites can be used to store solar heat harvested from solar thermal collectors. The largest use for zeolite is the global laundry detergent market. ==References== Category:Tectosilicates",
