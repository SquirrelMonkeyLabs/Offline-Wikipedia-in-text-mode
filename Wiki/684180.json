 "text": "A great crested newt, northern crested newt, or warty newt (Triturus cristatus) is a newt in the family Salamandridae, found mainly across Europe up to about the Ural Mountains.Also sometimes in westernmost Asia. It is a relatively large species. Females can measure up to 16 cm and are larger than males, which are 14 to 15 cm long. It is a protected species in the UK and Europe. Land development, population growth and agriculture has disturbed the newt, and it is becoming quite rare. The newt breeds in ponds and pools, but usually lives on land. The larvae turn into air-breathing young efts and move onto land. They eat small invertebrates, and hibernate through the winter.English Nature: Great crested newt. == References == Category:Newts Category:Animals of Europe",
