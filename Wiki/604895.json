He had been leader of the Labor Party from 1977 to 1983, as well serving as a cabinet minister in the Whitlam and Hawke Governments. Hayden was elected to the House of Representatives when he was 28 years old. He replaced Jim Cairns as Treasurer in 1975, but served for only five months. In early 1977, Hayden challenged Whitlam for the party leadership and was defeated by just two votes. He replaced Whitlam as Leader of the Opposition at the end of the year when Whitlam resigned as a result of Labor's defeat at the 1977 election.Paul Keating, 'The Hayden Oration 29 September 2017' , University of Southern Queensland, Ipswich Campus, Queensland.
