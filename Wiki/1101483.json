It's about 60 kilometers south of a town called Alta and also about 60 kilometers north of another village called Kautokeino. Most of the people in the village are Sami, who are native to the Fennoscandinavian peninsula and not from Norway. Masi Church has been there since the 1600s. The church now is a new one because the old one got burned down by German soldiers during World War II. In the late 1970s, the Norwegian government wanted to build a big power station downstream from Masi. They thought this would flood Masi, the area around Kautokeino, and where reindeer graze. People protested against this, and it became known as the Alta controversy. ==References == ==Other websites== Category:Villages in Norway Category:Settlements in Finnmark",
