 "text": "Anthropometry is the study of measurement and proportions of the human body. == Alphonse Bertillon and Criminology == Anthropometry was first created by Alphonse Bertillon (April 24, 1853 – February 13, 1914). He was born in Paris, France. When he became a police officer, he created Anthropometry so that criminals could be easily identified. The system helped the police to get through many criminal records quicker. Having produced a set of characteristics of criminals, it became easier for the police to identify offenders. == Anthropometric measurements == The system involves 10 measurements: *Height *Stretch *Bust *Head length (crown to forehead) *Head width (temple to temple) *Cheek width *Ear length (both left and right) *Middle finger *Foot length *Cubit (length from elbow to middle finger) == References == *Burnett, “Introduction to Human factors, Human anatomy and Biomechanics”.
