 "text": "A crisis pregnancy center (CPC), also known as a pregnancy resource center (PRC) or anti-abortion or pro-life pregnancy center, is a type of nonprofit organization created by people who are against abortion. Their goal is to convince pregnant women to not have an abortion. There are many crisis pregnancy centers. For example, in the United States, there are about 2,500 to 4,000 crisis pregnancy centers. Some are medical clinics that offer pregnancy tests and ultrasounds, but many do not have medical licenses. There are also CPCs in other regions or countries like Canada, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. CPCs sometimes tell wrong things about abortions to make it seem more dangerous than it really is. They might also give incorrect information about condoms and how to stay safe from diseases. For this, some people in favor of abortions or pro-choise call them “fake abortion clinics” because their ads don’t always tell the whole truth. Some laws have been made to stop these places from using confusing ads and to make sure they say if they don’t do abortions or have doctors. == References == Category:Women's rights",
