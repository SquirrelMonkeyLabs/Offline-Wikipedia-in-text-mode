 "text": "Bocage's rocket frog (Hyloxalus bocagei) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador and Colombia. ==Body== The adult male frog is 20.0-25.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 23.6-29.5 long. The skin of the frog's back has brown and gray marks on it and one lighter stripe on each side of the body. The male and female frogs have different colors on their bellies. ==Home== People see this frog near streams in forests on mountains. Sometimes people see them next to roads or in water pipes under roads. People have seen this frog between 980 and 1950 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Sumaco Napo-Galeras, Reserva Ecol√≥gica Cayambe-Coca, and Reserva Natural Comunitaria El Manantial Florencia. ==Young== The male frogs sit on or under small rocks and call to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches them until they hatch. Then he carries the tadpoles to streams. Scientists saw one male frog with ten tadpoles on his back. The tadpoles are all dark brown in color with a darker brown stripe on the back. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because people change the places where it lives. People build things that stop streams to make electricity, cut down trees to get wood to build with, and make bad chemicals from pipes that carry oil. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
