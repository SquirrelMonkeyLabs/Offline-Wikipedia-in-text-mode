 "text": "I'm Your Baby Tonight is the third studio album by American singer Whitney Houston. It released on November 6, 1990 by Arista Records. The album has been certified quadruple platinum in the US by the RIAA. For the album, Houston had more control with the album and worked with more R&B; and urban artists and songwriters such as L.A. Reid and Babyface, as well as singer Luther Vandross, and did a collaboration with Stevie Wonder, as well as working with previous producers Narada Michael Walden and Michael Masser, making the album a more R&B; sounding album than a pop and soul sounding album, while adding dance-pop and new jack swing sounds to the album. ==Track listing== ;Notes * All Non-North American countries had the \"Yvonne Turner Mix\" of \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" replacing the L.A.
