 "text": "Homo naledi is a species of archaic human found in the Rising Star Cave, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa. The species possibly lived in the Middle Pleistocene 335,000â€“236,000 years ago. The initial discovery comprises 1,569 specimens, representing 737 different elements, and at least 69 different people. Despite this exceptionally high number of specimens, their ranking with the Homo genus remains unclear. Even though it is in the Homo genus, they have some similarities with the Australopithecus genus and the first human species. For example, they have a small brain compared to modern humans. They were more adapted to climbing and tree-dwelling (aboreal) than running through long distances. == Gallery == == References == Category:Hominins Category:Prehistoric Africa",
