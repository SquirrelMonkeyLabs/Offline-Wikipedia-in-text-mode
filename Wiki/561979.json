It is a day \"to celebrate a regained awareness by the black community about their great worth and things they have done for the country\". The date is an official public holiday in five Brazilian states. Black Awareness Day has been celebrated since the 1960s. It has become bigger in the last few years. First, it was celebrated on May 13 (the date of abolition of slavery in Brazil). It was later moved to November 20 to honour Zumbi's death, and is sometimes called Zumbi Day. == Events == Members of the organization \"Black Movement\" (the largest of its kind in Brazil) organize educational and fun events involving mainly children of African parents.

Other \"hot topics\" in the Black community during the Day of Black Awareness are the working together of African-Brazilian workers with Caucasian-Brazilian and other workers, ethnic identity, and black pride. == Similar days celebrating racial groups in Brazil == The \"Day of the Caboclo\" (Dia do Caboclo) is held on June 24.
