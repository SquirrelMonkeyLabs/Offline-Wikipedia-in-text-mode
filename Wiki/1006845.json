 "text": "Shrine Shinto is a form of the Shinto religion which emphasizes ritual over belief. It has two main varieties: State Shinto which was controlled by the Japanese government, and another centered on Shinto shrines after World War II.景山春樹 「神道」『世界大百科事典』 219頁。 In the Empire of Japan Shrine Shinto was considered secular due to Secular Shrine Theory and only Sect Shinto was considered religious. This is because they argued belief made something a religion, and not ritual. Today, the term \"Shinto\" commonly refers to Shrine Shinto. Shrine Shinto is the most common form of Shinto.. Prior to 1945, all Shinto shrines were under the jurisdiction of the Institute of Divinities, which was an external department of the Home Ministry. After World War II the Shinto Directive issued by the General Headquarters of the Allied Forces (GHQ) in December 1945 abolished the Institute of Divinities and reorganized it into one religious corporation, known as the Association of Shinto Shrines. Shinto shrines and their rituals are conducted in accordance with sacred texts such as the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, which are considered important scriptures in Shintoism. The Kannushi, who hold positions such as priests, priests-in- charge, and administrators of the rituals, are responsible for conducting these rituals. However, the miko, who are female attendants at Shinto shrines, are not considered part of the priesthood in Shintoism. While a Kagura dancer, who performs traditional Shinto dance, may participate in Shinto rituals, they are not authorized to preside over or perform the rituals in a priestly role. == Related pages == * Seicho-no-Ie * List of Shinto shrines * Secular Shrine Theory * Shinto sects and schools * Sect Shinto == References == == Sources == * Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Shinto",
