It manages the network and online catalog of the Italian National Library Service (Servizio bibliotecario nazionale or SBN). It also manages Internet Culturale, an online collection of digitized documents and pictures held in Italian libraries. The ICCU publishes books and reports on library science in Italy and organizes conferences on library science. ICCU numbers serve as authority controls. As of February 2012, the ICCU had authority controls for the names of over 43,000 people.Walsby, Malcolm and Kemp, Graeme (2011). The Book Triumphant, p. 42. Brill.
