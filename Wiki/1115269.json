 "text": "Timberwolf was a port of the Firefox web browser to the AmigaOS 4 platform. == History == Timberwolf was a project to port Mozilla Firefox to AmigaOS 4. The project and its developers would be paid if they successfully ported the browser. The browser was created in early 2009 as a parallel to AmiZIlla, which wanted to do the same thing. The history of Amizilla was more complex though due to work being started in 2003 by the US firm DiscreetFX with the goal of porting a browser that was based off the Gecko engine while being compatible with the Firefox browser to Amiga platforms. Due to the team at Amizilla being too ambitious, work on the browser was stopped on 19 November 2009, without anything to show. Timberwolf was originally controlled by Thomas and Hans-Joerg Frieden (Developers for AmigaOS 4). The first release was released the public in June 2010. On 23 July 2012, the project was considered complete and the money was transferred to the bank accounts of the Friedens. After the bounty was closed, the Friedens stopped working on the project. In 2013, Steven Solie (Team leader for AmigaOS 4) got the source code and began to work on Timberwolf with a team of part-time developers. == References == Category:Web browsers Category:Web browsers based on Firefox",
