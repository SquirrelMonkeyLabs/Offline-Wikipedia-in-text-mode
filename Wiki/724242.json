 "text": "The University of Zagreb (, ; ) is the largest Croatian university and the oldest continuously operating university in the area covering Central Europe south of Vienna and all of Southeastern Europe. The history of the University began on September 23, 1669, when the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I issued a decree granting the establishment of the Jesuit Academy of the Royal Free City of Zagreb. The decree was accepted at the Council of the Croatian Kingdom on November 3, 1671. The Academy was run by the Jesuits for more than a century until the order was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. In 1776, Empress Maria Theresa issued a decree founding the Royal Academy of Science which succeeded the previous Jesuit Academy. Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer proposed the founding of a University to the Croatian Parliament in 1861. Emperor Franz Joseph signed the decree on the establishment of the University of Zagreb in 1869. The Act of Founding was passed by the Parliament in 1874, and was ratified by the Emperor on January 5, 1874. On October 19, 1874, the Royal University of Franz Joseph I was officially opened. The University is composed of 29 faculties, 3 art academies and 1 university center with more than 70,000 students. The University is as of 2018 at the 463rd place out of 1000 on the list of Universities of the world made by the Center for University World Rankings. ==Faculties== Natural sciences * Faculty of Science Engineering * Faculty of Architecture * Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Technology * Faculty of Civil Engineering * Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing * Faculty of Geodesy * Faculty of Geotechnics (in Varaždin) * Faculty of Graphic Arts * Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture * Faculty of Metallurgy (in Sisak) * Faculty of Mining, Geology and Petroleum Engineering * Faculty of Textile Technology * Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences Biomedical sciences * Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry * Faculty of Veterinary Medicine * School of Dental Medicine * School of Medicine Biotechnology * Faculty of Agriculture * Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology * Faculty of Forestry Social sciences * Faculty of Economics and Business * Faculty of Kinesiology * Faculty of Law * Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Varaždin * Faculty of Political Science * Faculty of Special Education and Rehabilitation * Faculty of Teacher Education Humanities * Catholic Faculty of Theology * Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences * University Centre for Croatian Studies The arts * Academy of Dramatic Art * Academy of Fine Arts * Academy of Music ==Rectors== :1.
