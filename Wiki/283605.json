 "text": "The Peppermint is a hybrid plant of the mint family. It is originally from Europe, but grown and sold all over the world. It is a hybrid of watermint and spearmint. Carolus Linnaeus first described the plant in 1753, from samples that had been collected in England. He treated it as a species,Linnaeus, C. (1753). Species Plantarum 2: 576–577. but modern biology mostly treats it as a hybrid.Harley, R. M. (1975). Mentha L. In: Stace, C. A., ed. Hybridization and the flora of the British Isles page 387. The peppermint is found in some medications, in particular Skumin’s mixture. == References == Category:Lamiaceae",
