 "text": "The presidential campaign of Vivek Ramaswamy for the 2024 United States presidential election began on February 21, 2023. By early February, it was reported that Ramaswamy, a first generation Indian American, was preparing a presidential campaign. A wealthy biotech entrepreneur, Ramaswamy officially announced his campaign on February 21, 2023. Ramaswamy is an outspoken critic of “woke-ism”, which he considers victimhood belief-system that negatively impacts the key American values of faith, patriotism, and work-ethics. Ramaswamy has also criticized the corporate environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, alleging that these ESG activities mix business with politics and disadvantage the shareholders. The New York Times has described Ramaswamy as an anti-woke candidate, and The Hill characterizes him as a conservative. His campaign admitted in May 2023 that he had paid an editor to edit his English Wikipedia page before announcing his candidacy, but denied that it was politically motivated. Following the 2024 Iowa caucus on January 15, 2024, Ramaswamy ended his campaign, and formally endorsed Donald Trump. ==References== Ramaswamy, Vivek",
