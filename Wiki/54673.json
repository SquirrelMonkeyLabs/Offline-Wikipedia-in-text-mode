Darth Maul follows her to Tatooine, where he sends out probe droids to find her. As Anakin, the Queen and the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn get ready to leave the planet, Darth Maul attacks on his speeder and Maul and Qui-Gon battle. After losing the Queen, Darth Sidious sends Darth Maul to Naboo to watch over the planet. When the Queen launches an attack, Darth Maul shows himself again. This time Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi start to battle with him. Darth Maul kills Qui-Gon and almost pushes Obi-Wan down a pit. In the end, Obi-Wan uses Qui- Gon's lightsaber to cut Darth Maul in half. Darth Maul fell down the pit, but somehow survived, as shown when he turns up again in the 2008 animated TV series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars. ==References== == Other websites == * Star Wars Databank Maul, Darth Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1999 Category:Star Wars Anthology characters Category:Star Wars Skywalker Saga characters",
