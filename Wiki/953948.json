 "text": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is commonly called a mini-stroke. It is a minor stroke. Symptoms usually end in less than an hour. TIA causes the same symptoms seen in strokes like weakness or numbness on one side of the body, loss of vision, difficulty speaking, slurred speech or confusion. Having multiple TIAs is a risk factor for having a major stroke. People with TIA often have a major stroke within 48 hours of the TIA. ==Related pages== * Silent stroke ==References== Category:Stroke",
