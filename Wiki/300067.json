Later on, a prison guard finds a letter that belongs to Lecter. The letter is from The Tooth Fairy. Graham and Crawford find out that The Tooth Fairy is talking to Lecter through advertisements in a newspaper. Graham asks a journalist from the newspaper to write an article despising the Tooth Fairy. They feel sure this will result in another advertisement, and this time they will pick up the code. The journalist is caught by The Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan) and killed. The Tooth Fairy, called \"Francis Dollarhyde\", works in a photographic lab. He is attracted to a woman he works with called Reba McClane. Reba is blind. Dollarhyde drives her home one night. They start a relationship with each other.

Dollarhyde kills the other man and takes Reba to his house. Graham has found out how The Tooth Fairy finds his victims. The Tooth Fairy uses the home movies brought to his job to pick a family to kill. Now that he knows this, Graham is able to find out who The Tooth Fairy is.

William Petersen worked with policemen in Chicago and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to learn more about his part.Simmons, Sue (interviewer); Petersen, William (actor). (15 August 1986). Live at Five: Interview with William Petersen. [Television Production]. NBC. Michael Mann took three years to write the movie, and he also spoke to policemen to learn about their jobs. Because of this, books have said the movie is very true to real life. Tom Noonan started getting ready for the movie by reading about other serial killers. He did not like this idea when he started. He changed his mind and acted his own way instead. He said he wanted The Tooth Fairy to seem like \"he was doing this out of love\". Joan Allen played Dollarhyde's blind girlfriend. She went to the New York Institute for the Blind to learn about blind people. She walked with a mask on to learn about being blind. Actors John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, William Friedkin and Brian Dennehy were all asked to play Hannibal Lecktor. Brian Cox played the part instead. Cox read about a Scottish serial killer named Peter Manuel to learn about his part. William Petersen played Will Graham. He was chosen because Michael Mann liked his movie To Live and Die in L.A.. Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were also asked to play the part. Tom Noonan says he was asked to act his part because Michael Mann thought he was very scary in real life. Dante Spinotti, who filmed the movie, made use of strong colors. Parts of the movie with Will Graham and his wife use a \"romantic blue\". Parts that show The Tooth Fairy use an ugly green or purple color. When the move was being made, Tom Noonan asked that nobody saw him. Those people who could saw him called him \"Francis\", because he pretended to be his character the whole time. This made the other actors afraid of him. The first time Noonan met William Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window while making the last part of the movie.Mann, Michael (writer/director). (2007).
