In this movie, Copper wants to join a band of singing stray dogs. The movie features the voices of Reba McEntire and Patrick Swayze. The movie had an official soundtrack album released on November 21, 2006. ==Plot== The movie opens with Tod and Copper chasing a cricket together. They see a line of trucks bringing the county fair to town. Copper is mesmerized by the sound of dogs singing together in an old school bus with \"The Singin' Strays\" painted on the side. The pair are eager to go see the fair, but when Copper's clumsy tracking skills disappoint his master Amos Slade yet again, the pup is tied up in the yard while Slade and Chief go to the fair without him. Tod arrives and pulls Copper's collar off. The two friends head to the fair. Tod and Copper get to meet The Singin' Strays. The band has five members: Dixie, Cash, Granny Rose, and twin brothers Waylon and Floyd. It is important that they perform well because a talent scout from the Grand Ole Opry will be at the fair. Cash and Dixie get into an argument. Dixie walks off before their performance, forcing them to go on stage without her. During the show, Copper sings along. Cash invites Copper up on stage to sing with them. The musical number is a success. Cash invites Copper to join the band. Copper joins the band after Tod lies that Copper is a stray. Copper spends the entire day with Cash, forgetting his promise to watch fireworks with Tod. Dixie finds Tod and sympathizes with his feelings of abandonment. During their conversation, Tod tells Dixie that Copper is not a stray. Dixie then hatches a plan to get Copper kicked out of the band. Tod sneaks into Chief's barrel, luring him and Slade to the fair in a wild chase. The chase leads to widespread mayhem in the fair. The Singin' Strays' performance is sabotaged right in front of the talent scout Mr. Bickerstaff. Copper is fired from the band and returns home with Slade. Granny Rose and the rest of the members of Cash's band feel quite sorry for Copper about this. This causes the band to break up. Tod tries to apologize to Copper, but Copper is angry at the fox for ruining everything. Tod is brought home by his owner, Widow Tweed. Along the way, Tweed narrowly misses being hit by the talent scout's car. Bickerstaff's hat flies off and lands on Tod. The following day, Tod and Copper admit their mistakes and are friends again. Hoping to make up for his doings, Tod gives Bickerstaff's hat to Copper. Copper uses it to track down the talent scout at a local diner. Tod tricks Cash and Dixie into thinking the other is in trouble. The entire band end up meeting up at the diner. Copper convinces the band the importance of harmony. The Singin' Strays howl their song We're in Harmony, attracting the attention of the talent scout and reuniting the band. Impressed with the band, he arranges for the dogs to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. The movie ends with Copper choosing to leave the band and play with Tod again. ==Cast== * Reba McEntire as Dixie * Patrick Swayze as Cash * Jonah Bobo as Tod * Harrison Fahn as Copper * Jeff Foxworthy as Lyle * Vicki Lawrence as Granny Rose * Stephen Root as Winchell P.
