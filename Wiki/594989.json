 "text": "Thomas Leslie \"Tom\" Pritchard (10 March 1917 - 22 August 2017) was a New Zealand cricketer. He was born in Kaupokonui, Taranaki, New Zealand. Pritchard played most of his first-class cricket in England. Pritchard was a genuinely fast right-arm bowler and a useful lower order right-handed batsman who played in several matches for Wellington before the Second World War. He said in 2013 that his 1939 memories of a game at the Basin Reserve and of playing for his country were still strong. In March 2017 he became only the third New Zealand first-class cricketer, after John Wheatley and Syd Ward, to reach 100 years of age. Pritchard died at the age of 100 on 22 August 2017 in Levin, New Zealand of pneumonia-related complications. ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2017 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:New Zealand centenarians",
