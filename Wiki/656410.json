Later, Abhi gets to know about the Suryadevara curse, and distances herself from Abhi. Seeing this Chanakya was infuriated and unwillingly marries Divya. Seeing this, Abhi panics as he recalls the Swami's words that the Suryadevara curse, is showing its effect on the daughters of the family, and not on the daughters-in law. Seeing this Divya, goes to Chanakya's house as his wife and tortures him for saddening her brother. Later various events unfold, and Abhi marries Seshi. Later, Divya also gets to know about the curse and curses herself for marrying Seshi to Abhi. But later on, she vows to do anything to save Seshi from the curse, and without telling Chanakya and Seshi about the curse, She, Abhi and Chanakya try every possible method to escape from the curse as told by Swamiji.

Abhi later meets Nithya in jail, and Nithya asks Divya to fall on her feet and ask for her forgiveness, but Abhi denies strongly, and Nithya threatens to kill Chanakya. A sad time has come over the family, and Chankya is facing threats from Nithya as well as the effects of Suryadevara curse. Later one day, Chanakya dies while saving Divya from an attack orchestrated by Nithya. Nithya is shown laughing and happy over her so- called victory, and says goodbye to the viewers. Meanwhile, the Suryadevara family remorses over Chanakya's death, and Seshi gets furious on everyone and especially Divya, blaming her for her brother's death, saying that his life would have been saved if Divya would have fallen on Nithya's feet. She even asks Abhi to throw her out of her house. Seeing this Divya herself leaves the house in the middle of the night. 7 Years Later It is Divya and Abhi's birthday, and Abhi is still missing Divya.
