 "text": "The Binding of Isaac (, ), or simply \"The Binding\" (, ),\"Akedah\". Jewish Virtual Library. Accessed March 25, 2011 is a story from Genesis 22 of the Hebrew Bible. In the story, God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac at Moriah. Abraham does this by binding (tying) Isaac to an altar, but is stopped by an angel, who says \"Do not lay a hand on the boy ... Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son\". A ram (male sheep) appears instead, and is sacrificed instead. In addition to being addressed by modern scholarship, this biblical episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional sources of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In Christianity, the binding of Isaac is seen to prefigure the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. The incident occurred on Mt. Moriah, which is associated with the Temple Mount as well as Calvary, where Jesus would die 2,000 years later. == References == Category:Hebrew Bible",
