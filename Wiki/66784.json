 "text": "Mosleh Zamani (also referred as Moslah Zamani) was a young Kurdish man from Sanandaj, who was executed for adultery in December 2009 (under Iranian law, every sexual contact outside marriage, even if both people are unmarried, is adulterous). Mosleh, who was arrested at age of 17 and spend four years in prison, was sentenced to death by hanging. His case raised strong controversies, because of both nature of his crime and fact he was 17 year old (Iran, because of international obligations, is not permitted to sentence anyone to death for crime he or she had committed under age of 18). The only person who could have commuted the death sentence is Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the head of the judiciary. ==Related pages== * Delara Darabi * Reza Alinejad == Other websites == * About Mosleh Category:Iranian people",
