 "text": "Ecnomiohyla, or fringe-limbed treefrogs or marvelous frogs, is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. A genus is a group of species. It is part of taxonomy, which is the way scientists put living things in groups. Scientists invented this group in 2005 after looking very closely at which frogs they had put in Hylidae. At first, scientists had put ten species in this genus. Before that, those frogs had been in Hyla. Two more species, E. rabborum and E. sukia, were discovered later. ==Name== The name Ecnomiohyla comes from the Greek word ecnomios (\"marvelous\" or \"unusual\") and Hylas. In Greek mythology, Hylas was Hercules' friend. ==Appearance== Frogs in Ecnomiohyla are middle- sized or large. They have fringes of skin on their legs. They have very large front and back feet. They live in canopies in wet forested highlands in southern Mexico through Central America to Colombia. They are capable of gliding using their webbed hands and feet. ==Species== The genus has 12 species in it, Binomial name and author Common name Ecnomiohyla bailarina Golden-eyed fringe-limbed treefrog Ecnomiohyla echinata Oaxacan fringe-limbed treefrog Ecnomiohyla fimbrimembra Heredia treefrog Ecnomiohyla miliaria Cope's brown treefrog Ecnomiohyla minera Guatemala treefrog Ecnomiohyla phantasmagoria Ecnomiohyla rabborum Rabb's fringe-limbed treefrog (probably extinct, 2016) Ecnomiohyla salvaje Copan treefrog Ecnomiohyla sukia Shaman fringe-limbed tree frog Ecnomiohyla thysanota Cerro Mali treefrog Ecnomiohyla valancifer San Martin fringe-limbed treefrog Ecnomiohyla veraguensis AmphibiaWeb lists the same species but also includes Rheohyla miotympanum in this genus. ==Related pages== *Flying frog ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
