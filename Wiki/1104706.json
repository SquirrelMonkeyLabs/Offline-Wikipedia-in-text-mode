 "text": "The Department of Alaska was first conceptualised in 1837 by Sir Alexander Hoff of the Western America Prosperity Group on behalf of the United States Government. As a proxy, his efforts in the group allowed him to make clear negotiations for the Alaska Purchase. Though little is known of the WAPG or Alexander Hoff's findings, there is findings from an abandoned shelter on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska of translated treaties from Russian to American of negotiations over settlements and their deeds.
