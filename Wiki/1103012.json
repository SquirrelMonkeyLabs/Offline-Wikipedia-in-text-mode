 "text": "The African foam-nest tree frog, western foam-nest tree frog, or western foam- nest frog (Chiromantis rufescens) is a frog. It lives in Africa, from Sierra Leone and Liberia to Uganda and Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Scientists think it might live in Togo and Benin too. This is a large frog. The adult male frog is 44-49 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 51-60 mm long. The skin of the frog's back gray or gray-green in color. Sometimes there are darker marks on the back. The belly and front of the neck are white in color. There is bright blue-green color on the bottoms of the legs and inside the mouth. The female frog lays eggs in foam nests. She makes the foam nest over the water. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. The tadpoles are gray in color. They have round bodies and short tails. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and because there are many of them. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
