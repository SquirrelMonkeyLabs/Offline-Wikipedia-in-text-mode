 "text": "Angel Road railway station was a station in the London Borough of Enfield at Edmonton in north east London. It was in Travelcard Zone 4, on the Tottenham Hale branch of the Lea Valley Lines. The station and all trains serving it were operated by Abellio Greater Anglia. It was partially located beneath the A406 road (which is named Angel Road at that point). Due to reconstruction of the A406 in the mid-1990s (involving grade-separation), the only access to the station was via a footpath running south from Conduit Lane to the north, instead of on Angel Road. The station was unstaffed. Angel Road closed on 31 May 2019. It was replaced by Meridian Water station, 580m south of Angel Road. It opened on 3 June 2019. ==References== * * ==Other websites== * Timetables from 'one' * ==Gallery== Image:Angel Road stn southbound.JPG|View southwards towards the A406 Angel Road (North Circular Road), no longer having an access to the station.
