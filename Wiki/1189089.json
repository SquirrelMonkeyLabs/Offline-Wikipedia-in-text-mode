 "text": "Alsodes australis is a frog. It lives in Chile. Scientists think it might live in Argentina too. ==Home== This frog lives in cold streams in forests on mountains. People see them under logs. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 1400 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog some protected places: Bernardo O'Higgins National Park and Queulat National Park in Chile. There are some frogs in Argentina's Nahuel Huapi National Park that scientists think might be A. australis, but they might be other frogs. ==Threats== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists say fish from other parts of the world and American mink might kill this frog. Human beings brought both the fish and the mink to the frog's home. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in streams. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
