 "text": "The Battle of Fundina took place on August 2, 1876, in Kuči, Montenegro, on St. Elijah's Day. The Montenegrins, led by Ilija Plamenac and Marko Miljanov, had 5,000 soldiers, while the Ottomans had 50,000. A Montenegrin Muslim revealed the Ottoman plans, allowing the Montenegrins to attack a day earlier. Most of the fighting happened at Heljam hill, where the Ottomans defended from trenches. After winning, the Montenegrins captured Ottoman leaders and burned them in a house. The Ottomans fled in retreat. The Martinići battalion killed 2,000 Ottomans and captured 6 flags. Hero Novak Vujošević killed 28 Ottomans and was honored by the Russian emperor. The victory stopped the Ottoman advance and secured Montenegrin success in the 1876–1878 war. ==Related pages== *Montenegrin-Ottoman War (1876-1878) *Battle of Vučji Do ==References== ==Sources== *William H.
