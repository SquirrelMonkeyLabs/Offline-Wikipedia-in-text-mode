 "text": "The greater bromeliad tree frog (Bromeliohyla dendroscarta) is a frog. It lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it between 450 and 1900 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult frog can be as big as 35 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin on the frog's back can be yellow in color with small brown spots to green. The iris of the eye is gold in color. The belly is yellow in color. Tadpoles are whitish in color. Their bellies are clear. The tadpoles only eat dead things, for example dead insects, that fall into the water in the bromeliad plants. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places it lives. Human beings cut down trees in the forests where it lives to collect wood for building, to make towns, to make farms, and to make places for animals to eat grass. Climate change and ultraviolet light can also kill this frog. Diseases can also kill this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
