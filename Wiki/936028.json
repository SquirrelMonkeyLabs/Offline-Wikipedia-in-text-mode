 "text": "Ion Plus is an American TV network owned by Ion Media. It operated as a network available through an antenna or cable TV until February 28, 2021. The network originally launched in 2007 as Ion Life. The network featured home decoration, health, cooking, and travel shows. In 2019, Ion Media converted the network into a general entertainment format that matched that of parent network Ion Television, mainly showing crime drama shows. It then became Ion Life. Under new ownership by the E. W. Scripps Company, the channel stopped being broadcast on February 28, 2021, as the new company preferred to bring over networks it already owned. Ion Plus and Qubo continues but is only available through smart TV services on television sets made by Vizio and Samsung and other free streaming services like The Roku Channel and Amazon Freevee. ==Other websites== * Category:American television channels Category:2021 disestablishments in the United States",
