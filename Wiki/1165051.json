 "text": "Deicide is an American death metal band from Tampa, Florida. They got together in 1987. The band's music has made a lot of people mad over the years, mainly due to how much lead singer Glen Benton hates Jesus Christ and Christianity. The band sings about Satanism, too. Glen Benton told everyone that he worshipped Satan during the early days of the band, but has since admitted that he is just a showman. The band's music is very fast, angry, dark and mean. Glen Benton uses low growls and high screams in the band's music. The Hoffman brothers used high-pitched guitar tones on the band's first few albums. The band's drummer, Steve Ashiem, plays really fast beats on the drums. They are called \"blast beats.\" He also plays with two bass drums, which is pretty common in death metal. == References == Category:Heavy metal bands Category:Musical groups from Florida Category:1987 establishments in the United States Category:1980s American music groups Category:American heavy metal bands",
