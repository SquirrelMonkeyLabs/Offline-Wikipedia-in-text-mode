 "text": "Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama movie starring Orson Welles in his first full-length movie. There are rumors that its story is based on the life of the famous businessmen William Randolph Hearst, Howard Hughes, and Samuel Insull. Welles said that his character, Kane, was based on more than one famous person. In F for Fake (1974), he said that Kane was going to be based on Hughes but that Welles became inspired by Hearst. Welles worked closely with his cinematographer, Gregg Toland, who was in charge of the camera and the lights. Together, they worked on a new style, \"deep focus.\" Usually, if something close to the camera is in focus, everything that is far away is out of focus. In deep focus, every object is in focus at the same time. Its working title, before the movie was finished, was RKO 281. Many have called Citizen Kane the best movie of all time. In 1998, it was number one on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Years... 100 Movies. It is in some ways is like The Power and the Glory (1933). The last living crew member was director Robert Wise. Also known for making The Sound of Music (1965), he died on September 14, 2005. == Other websites == * * The American Film Institute's \"100 Greatest Movies\" list * Original Trailer * Greatest Films: Citizen Kane * Essay on the use of mise-en-scene and cinematography * RaveCentral: Citizen Kane Category:1941 drama movies Category:1941 mystery movies Category:1940s American drama movies Category:American mystery movies Category:British mystery movies Category:British drama movies Category:French mystery movies Category:French drama movies Category:Danish drama movies Category:Movies set in New York (state) Category:Movies set in Florida Category:Movies set in country houses Category:Movies composed by Bernard Herrmann Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Movies directed by Orson Welles",
