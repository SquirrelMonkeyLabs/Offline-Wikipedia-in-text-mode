 "text": "The Frontier states of the Gupta Empire refers to the various monarchial and republican states that accepted their dependence on the Gupta Empire. The eastern frontier states included the Kingdoms of Samatata, Davaka, Kamarupa, Nepal and Karttripura. == List of the frontier states == === Samatata === Starting from the East, Harisena first mentions Samatata. The earliest mention of this country in literature is found in the Brihatsamhita of Varahamihira. Fleet explains the name as referring to a country with rivers that have flat and level banks on both sides, which describes lower Bengal. Smith notes that the name Samatata highlights the difference in appearance between the swamps of deltaic Bengal and the drier regions of Bihar and the North-Western Provinces. From the Ashrafpur plates and the account of I-tsing, we learn that during the seventh century, Samatata was ruled by the Khadaga dynasty, with its capital at Karmmanta (modern Kamta), about 12 miles west of Comilla. Under these kings, Samatata included the districts of Tippera, Noakhali, Barisal, Faridpur, and the eastern half of Dacca. === Dvaka === Davaka is identified with the modern place called Daboka in the Nowgong District of Assam. === Kamarupa === Kamarupa consisted of the western districts of the Brahmaputra valley. It was the most powerful state in the region and the first to be approached from the western side, so it came to represent the entire valley. Pragjyotish is identified as the capital of Kamarupa, which is associated with the city of Kamakhya or modern-day Gauhati. === Nepala === In Nepal, Jaydeva I, the Lichchhavi king, was related to Samudragupta. His submission to Samudragupta effectively meant the submission of the Himalayan states on the Indian side. During Jayadeva's reign, the Gupta Era was introduced in Nepal. === Kartipura === This kingdom likely covered the lower ranges of the western Himalayas, including areas like Kumaun, Almora, Garhwal, and Kangra. Upon reconsideration, we no longer support the earlier suggestion by Dashratha Sharma that identified it with Kahror or Karur, located between Multan and Loni. == References == Category:Gupta emperors",
