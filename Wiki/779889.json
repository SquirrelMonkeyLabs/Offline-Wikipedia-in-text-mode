 "text": "Sonic X-treme was a platform game developed by Sega Technical Institute. It was being developed from 1994 until Sega cancelled it in 1997. It was meant to be the first 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game. It was also meant to be the first new Sonic game for the Sega Saturn. == Plot == The story of the game was that Robotnik was trying to steal six magic rings from Tiara Boobowski and her father, so Sonic wants to stop him. == Background == When Nintendo released Super Mario 64, it was a popular 3D platformer, so Sega wanted to compete with Nintendo with their own 3D Sonic game. == Development == Sonic X-treme was originally developed for the Sega 32X under the name of Sonic Mars, but after cancellation the game was slowly reworked into Sonic X-treme. The game was cancelled in 1997 because of development issues and the closure of SEGA Technical Institute. To make up for this, SEGA ported Sonic 3D Blast to the SEGA Saturn instead.
