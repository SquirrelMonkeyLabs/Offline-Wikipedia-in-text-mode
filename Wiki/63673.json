 "text": "4′33″ is a musical composition written by avant-garde (non-traditional) musician John Cage. It is his most famous work. It consists of no notes, only 4 minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence. The piece challenges the definition of music. The only thing the sheet music says is \"tacet\", or \"it is silent\". It was first played by David Tudor in Woodstock, New York. == Other websites == * John Cage's 4'33\" * Classical Notes Category:Compositions",
