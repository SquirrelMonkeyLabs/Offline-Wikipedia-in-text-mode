 "text": "Grogue, also known as grogu or grogo (derived from English grog), is a strong Cape Verdean alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane. Nearly all the sugarcane is used in the production of grogue. The cane is processed in a press known as a trapiche. It is the basis for a Cape Verdean cocktail known as ponche (derived from the English word \"punch\"), made with lime and molasses, like the poncha of the island of Madeira. Grogue and sugarcane production is mostly in Santo Antão and Santiago. Grogue is used as a base for medicine. Herbs such as common rue, rosemary, or anise are added. There is also a grogue preparation made with percebes (goose neck barnacles). It is made in a traditional way and because of this there are a lot of different versions on the market. The government of Cabo Verde is busy with a European company to introduce grogue on the European markets. This will be a fully controlled grogue of the best quality by the name 'Grogue Official'. In some tourist locations, caipirinhas are made with grogue. ==Gallery== Image:1996.12.00.cv.sa.RibeiradaCruz.Trapiche.jpg|Trapiche in Ribeira da Cruz, Santo Antão, Cape Verde File:Still used for making grogue in Cape Verde.jpg|Still used for making on Santo Antão File:Distilling grogue in Cape Verde.JPG|Distilling grogue == References == ==Further reading== *Mark Langworthy and Timothy J.
