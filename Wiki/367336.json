 "text": "John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir (1875-1940) was a British statesman and writer, today mostly remembered for his fine adventure stories. Buchan was educated at the University of Glasgow and Oxford, and began to write and publish stories from his college days. He later qualified as a lawyer and went to South Africa to work there in a government (colonial) job. He later served in many countries as a representative of the British government and was later made Governor-General of Canada. In 1935 the British government honoured him by making him a lord. He died in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1940. Some of his famous adventure thrillers include Prester John (1910), The Thirty Nine Steps (1915) and Greenmantle (1916). He also wrote some fine historical biographies like Montrose (1928) and Sir Walter Scott (1932). ==Honours== Ribbon bars of the Lord Tweedsmuir ;Appointments * 1 January 1932 11 February 1940: Companion of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) * 23 May 1935 11 February 1940: Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George (GCMG) * 2 November 1935 11 February 1940: Chief Scout for Canada * 2 November 1935 11 February 1940: Honorary Member of the Royal Military College of Canada Club * 28 May 1937 11 February 1940: Member of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council (PC) * 15 June 1939 11 February 1940: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) * : Honorary Fellow of Oxford University ;Medals * 1935: King George V Silver Jubilee Medal * 1937: King George VI Coronation Medal ;Awards * 1897: Stanhope essay prize * 1898: Newdigate Prize * 1928: James Tait Black Memorial Prize * 4 December 1940: Silver Wolf Award (posthumous) ;Foreign honours * 15 December 1918 11 February 1940: Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy ;Non-national honours * 1937 11 February 1940: Master of the Order of Good Cheer === Honorary military appointments === * 2 November 1935 11 February 1940: Colonel of the Governor General's Horse Guards * 2 November 1935 11 February 1940: Colonel of the Governor General's Foot Guards * 2 November 1935 11 February 1940: Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards === Honorary degrees === * 20 June 1934: University of Oxford, Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) * 1936: University of Toronto, Doctor of Laws (LLD) * 1936: University of Toronto, Doctor of Divinity (DD) * 1937: Harvard University, Doctor of Laws (LLD) * 1937: Yale University, Doctor of Laws (LLD) * : McGill University, Doctor of Laws (LLD) * : Université de Montréal, Doctor of Laws (LLD) * : University of Glasgow, Doctor of Laws (LLD) * : University of St. Andrews, Doctor of Laws (LLD) === Honorific eponyms === ;Geographic locations * : Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park * : Tweedsmuir North Provincial Park and Protected Area * : Tweedsmuir Peak * : Tweedsmuir Avenue, Ottawa * : Tweedsmuir Avenue, Toronto * : Tweedsmuir Avenue, London * : Tweedsmuir Place, Deep River * : Tweedsmuir Place, Pinawa * : Tweedsmuir Road, Winnipeg * : Buchan Street, Montreal * : Tweedsmuir * : John Buchan Way, Broughton ;Schools * : Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, Okotoks * : Lord Tweedsmuir Elementary School, New Westminster * : Lord Tweedsmuir Secondary School, Surrey * : Tweedsmuir Hall (student residence), University of British Columbia * : John Buchan Senior Public School, Toronto * : Tweedsmuir Public School, North Bay * : Tweedsmuir Public School, London ;Organisations * : John Buchan Centre, Broughton ==References== Category:1875 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Scottish writers Category:Governors-general of Canada Category:South African politicians Category:People from Perth, Scotland",
