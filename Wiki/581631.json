He served in Congress from 1993 to 2001. Both the Dickey Amendment (1996), which blocks CDC funds to be used for injury prevention research that might advocate or promote gun control, and the Dickey-Wicker Amendment (1995), which prohibits federal funds to be spent on research that involves the destruction of a human embryo, are named for him. After the 2012 Aurora shooting, former congressman Dickey said that he regrets his role in blocking the CDC from researching gun violence. Dickey died on April 20, 2017 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, aged 77.Former Arkansas Congressman Jay Dickey dies ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Pine Bluff, Arkansas Category:United States representatives from Arkansas Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
