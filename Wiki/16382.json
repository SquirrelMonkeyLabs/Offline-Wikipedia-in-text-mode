 "text": "Spring is the season after winter and before summer. Days become longer and the weather gets warmer in the temperate zone because Earth tilts relative to it is orbital plane around the Sun. In many parts of the world, it rains for hours. This helps the plant grow and flower bloom. Often people with hay fever suffer more because some plant pollen is allergen. Many animals have their breeding season in spring-type weather. At the start of spring, a person suffering from seasonal affective disorder will feel sick. The vernal equinox in springtime makes day and night equally long in temperate zone. Holidays celebrated in spring include Passover and Easter. In many countries, the period of school between early March and later May or early June is referred to as “Spring Semester” or “Spring Term”. Spring break is a vacation period in recent times at universities and schools in various countries around the globe. == Etymology == The Online Etymological Dictionary says that \"spring,\" as in the season, comes from the phrases \"springing time\" (14th century) and \"the spring of the year\". This is from an old word that means \"act or time of springing or appearing; the first appearance; the beginning, birth, rise, or origin\". Spring as a word came from Middle English's springen, from Old English's springan. These meant to go up or burst forward. These are like modern German's springen, which means 'jump'. It is not thought that these words were talking about the season. They all come from the Proto-Germanic sprenganan. == References == Category:Basic English 850 words",
