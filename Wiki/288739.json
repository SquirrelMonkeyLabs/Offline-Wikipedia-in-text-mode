 "text": "Arctic Alaska, or Far North Alaska is a region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is the northern area between the Arctic Circle and the Arctic Ocean. Some of the places in Arctic Alaska are the North Slope Borough, the Northwest Arctic Borough, and the Nome Census Area. Some towns there are Prudhoe Bay, Barrow, Kotzebue, and Nome. Most of these places have no highways and can only be reached by aircraft or snowmobile, or by boat if they are on the coast or near a river when they are not frozen. Long ago there were only Inuits living here, who make up the majority of the population. They mostly ate salmon, which there are lots of there, and also whales and other marine mammals. More people came to Arctic Alaska when gold was discovered there. Still more people and industry came when petroleum was discovered in the area. Above the Arctic Circle, the sun rises in May and sets in August. Arctic Alaska is mostly tundra covering mountain ranges and coastal plains. Some of the animals there are bears, wolves, sheep, reindeer, and lots of birds. == Other websites == *Regions of Alaska, including description of Far North Alaska Category:Geography of Alaska Category:Arctic",
