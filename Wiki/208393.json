 "text": "Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics. Its aim is to summarize a set of statistical data. The data are usually taken by sampling a population. To picture the way the data are distributed, a histogram may be drawn. The data may be summarized by computing some characterising values, like the \"center\" of the data, and the \"spread\". In some cases the different items of data will be grouped and the groups will be described, in some way. Category:Statistics",
