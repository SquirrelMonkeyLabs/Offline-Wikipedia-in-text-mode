 "text": "Man Bites Dog is a 1992 Belgian mockumentary crime movie. It was released in 1993 in the United States. This movie is rated NC-17 due to strong graphic violence. The story of the movie is a crew of movie makers who follow a serial killer. They record his horrific crimes for a documentary they are making. At first they are only watching. Then they find themselves caught up in the increasingly chaotic and nihilistic violence. Since its release the picture has become an international cult film.https://www.npr.org/2011/12/07/143296617/what-s-on-your-cult-film-list NPR ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1992 crime movies Category:1992 comedy movies Category:1990s criminal comedy movies Category:Belgian crime movies Category:Belgian comedy movies Category:Antisocial personality disorder in fiction Category:NC-17 rated movies Category:Obscenity controversies Category:1992 independent movies Category:Movies set in Belgium Category:1990s serial killer movies Category:Movies about home invasions Category:Movies about filmmaking Category:Mockumentaries Category:Black-and-white movies Category:Cult movies",
