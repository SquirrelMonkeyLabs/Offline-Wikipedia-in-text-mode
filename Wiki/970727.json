 "text": "Parabuthus granulatus, better known as the granulated thick-tailed scorpion, is a large species of scorpion from the drier parts of southern Africa. It can measure up to 11.5 cm, and is dark yellow to brown in colour. It has a small vesicle, but is one of the more venomous scorpion species of the region. Of all scorpion species, it causes most of the serious cases of poisoning from the animal in South Africa, and a few people die each year from their sting. ==References== Category:Animals of Africa Category:Scorpions",
