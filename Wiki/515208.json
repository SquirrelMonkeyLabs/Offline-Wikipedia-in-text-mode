 "text": "A gallstone, also called a shav-stone, is a stone-like object (calculus) formed inside the gallbladder. Gallstones may pass into other parts of the biliary tract. If the stones pass out of the gall bladder they may cause extreme pain, which requires surgery or other treatment. == Cause of gallstones == Gallstones are solid particles that form in the gallbladder, a small organ located in the abdomen. They are made up of cholesterol, bile pigments, and other substances found in bile. The main cause of gallstones is an imbalance in the substances that make up bile. When the levels of cholesterol and other substances in bile become too high, they can form solid particles. This can occur due to a variety of factors, including: # Increased cholesterol levels: High levels of cholesterol in the bile can lead to the formation of gallstones. This may be due to a diet high in cholesterol or a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol levels. # Decreased bile movement: The movement of bile through the gallbladder and bile ducts helps prevent the formation of gallstones. If the flow of bile is slowed or blocked, it may lead to the formation of gallstones. # Increased bilirubin levels: Bilirubin is a substance produced when red blood cells are broken down. If the body produces too much bilirubin, it can lead to the formation of gallstones. # Other factors: Other factors that may increase the risk of developing gallstones include obesity, pregnancy, rapid weight loss, and certain medications. It is important to note that not all people who have gallstones will experience symptoms, and some people may develop gallstones without any known risk factors. == References == Category:Diseases and disorders of the digestive system",
