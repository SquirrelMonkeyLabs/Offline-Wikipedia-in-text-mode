He has written books, among which the two versions of Reportajes stand out, and he was awarded many times in Argentina. ==Biography and career== ===Beginnings=== He is the son of the owner of a graphic media company that published sports magazines, Alberto Fontevecchia, married to Nelva López de Fontevecchia, his mother. Graduated from Colegio Nacional No. 1 \"Bernardino Rivadavia\". He studied Business Administration at the Argentine Business University (UADE). In 1975 he published his first journalistic work: an extra edition about the winning team of a soccer championship. With the money obtained from that first experience, he traveled to Paraguay to found his first weekly information magazine: \"Actualidad\", which began to be published that same year. In 1976 he extended the venture to Uruguay, where he founded a weekly information magazine called \"Noticias\". The following year he returned to Argentina and launched a popular low-cost weekly newspaper that allowed him to obtain the capital to create the information weekly called \"La Semana.\" This magazine would give rise to Editorial Perfil, of which he continues to be the owner. ===Dictatorship (1976-1983)=== During the seven years that the military dictatorship lasted in Argentina (1976-1983), the circulation of \"La Semana\" was prohibited six times. It was also closed in 1982 and was reopened by order of the Argentine Supreme Court of Argentina several months later. In January 1979, when the distribution of La Semana had already suffered several prohibitions, at the age of 23 Jorge Fontevecchia was kidnapped by the military, imprisoned in the clandestine detention camp El Olimpo and later released thanks to the pressure exerted by international press organizations and the arrival of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that would occur a few months later. El Olimpo was one of the Army detention camps that housed around 700 people, of whom 650 were murdered. Fontevecchia did not claim or receive any compensation from the State for his kidnapping and disappearance. ===2000s and 2010s=== Perfil Newspaper maintained a critical line regarding the governments of Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, as before with Menem. According to Joaquín Morales Solá, Kirchner had \"a personal issue\" against Fontevecchia because he felt that \"he slandered him.\" In 2005 it relaunched Perfil as a Sunday newspaper. The first issue of this stage, of which 30,000 copies were printed, came out in the City of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas on September 11, 2005. Two years later it also began to be sold on Saturdays. Since 2012 he has been a member of the National Academy of Journalism. In 2014 Fontevechia was denounced for union persecution in the midst of a conflict over owed wages. In 2016, its main newspaper, Perfil, was once again in financial difficulties, causing complaints after the business decision not to pay the bonus or increases, and to pay salaries in installments. In 2017, Perfil launched an edition in the province of Córdoba, by a local team. On the eve of the 2023 elections, Fontevechia published an editorial in the newspaper Perfil where he openly called to vote against the presidential candidate Javier Milei. This positioning caused him to suffer several criticisms against him despite the fact that the journalist has historically openly declared his vote in the different elections. ==References== Category:Argentine journalists Category:Businesspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Writers from Buenos Aires",
