 "text": "The WAGR Qa class were a total of 4 successful steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1905 to 1925. The Qa class resulted from the rebuilding of Q class No. 140 with a larger boiler, and four-wheel trailing bogie added, and the fuel capacity increased (both water and coal). This rebuild started in 1903 and was completed in 1905 by Midland Railway Workshops, No. 140 having been selected to operate on the Upper Darling Range Railway which the WAGR had recently acquired. The experiment was a success with three more of the Q class being rebuilt to Qa class specifications in 1909. The Qa class was designated to haul goods, passenger and mixed services, in this position they served on the Kalamunda zig-zag, Mudaring Weir Branch Line, Eastern Railway to Northam, South Western Railway to Bunbury and the Pinjarra to Holyoake section of the Hotham Valley Railway. Withdrawals for the class began in 1924 and ended in 1925 with all being scrapped along with the original standard Q class. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
