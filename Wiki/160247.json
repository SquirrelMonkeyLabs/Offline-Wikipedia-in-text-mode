 "text": "Sainte-Marie-Outre-l'Eau is a commune. It is in Normandy in the Calvados department in northwest France. The name translates to Saint Mary beyond the Water. ==History== The village is small today. Up to the early 20th century it was a group of farms. Until a few years ago, there was no road connecting the village to Pont-Farcy. So, it was very isolated. ==Geography== The village is 1 kilometer from Pont-Farcy. It is along the D307 Road. The village is a collection of farm houses. It also has a church. The total population is just 81. However, this probably includes the neighbouring farms as well. Other nearby settlements are Pont-Bellanger and Beaumesnil. The nearest large towns are Villedieu-les-Poeles and Vire. The village is close to the Calvados tourist spot Grotte de Bion.
