According to Prema Music, dilrubha player Amrit Gajjar played on the track. It is the second of Harrison's songs to be explicitly influenced by Indian classical music, after \"Love You To\", and Harrison's only composition on Sgt. Pepper. \"Within You Without You\" was written on a harmonium at the house of long-time Beatles friend Klaus Voormann, while \"there were lots of joints being smoked\". Stephen Stills was so impressed by the lyrics that he had them carved on a stone monument in his yard. John Lennon said it was\"one of George's best songs.\" ==Personnel== * George Harrison – lead vocal, tambura, sitar * Session musicians – swarmandal, dilruba, tabla * Erich Gruenberg, Alan Loveday, Julien Gaillard, Paul Scherman, Ralph Elman, David Wolfsthal, Jack Rothstein Jack Greene – violin * Reginald Kilbey, Allen Ford, Peter Beavan – cello ==Notes== ==Other websites== * * * * * * * * Category:The Beatles songs Category:1967 songs",
