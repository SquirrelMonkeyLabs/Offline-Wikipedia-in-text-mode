Usually, the glans is covered by the foreskin, except in men who have been circumcised. == Diseases == The glans can become irritated or infected which occurs in a small number of males. It is more common in males who have poor hygene or are uncircumcised. The opening of the urethra is at the tip of the glans. In children who have been circumcised and wear diapers, the opening of the penis has no protection. This can cause the urethra to get very narrow in a small amount of boys which can need surgery to reopen later. The skin on the glans of an uncircumcised penis is very sensitive, and washing it too much with soap can cause dermatitis. Circumcised men have a dry and wider glans that is leathery to the touch. There are special Moisturizer that a circumcised man can use on his glans to provide softer. == Anatomy == The glans penis is a cap around the corpus spongiosum. It is attached to the Corpus cavernosum penis and at the tip of the glans is the urethra opening. The foreskin helps keeps the glans moist. In males who have been circumcised, the glans is dry. ==Related pages== * Corpus cavernosum * Foreskin * Penis * Clitoris * Frenulum * Circumcision ==Additional images== File:Corona of glans penis comparison.png|Uncircumcised and circumcised glans File:Flared glans penis comparison.png|Flaring the glans File:Pearly penile papules before and after treatment.jpg|Before and after treatment for pearly penile papules File:Penis head.jpg|Uncircumcised penis head out from the foreskin File:Skin bridge glans.jpg|Skin bridge glans == References == == Other websites == * - \"The Male Perineum and the Penis: The Corpus Spongiosum and Corpora Cavernosa\" * - \"The Male Pelvis: The Urethra\" Category:Penis Category:Anatomy of the male reproductive system",
