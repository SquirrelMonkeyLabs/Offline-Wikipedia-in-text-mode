 "text": "The Murray-Darling Basin is an area in Australia around the Murray and Darling Rivers. Three million Australians inside and outside the basin are directly dependent on its water. About 6 per cent of Australia's total rainwater falls into the Murray-Darling Basin. About 85 per cent of all irrigation in Australia takes place in the basin, which supports an agricultural industry worth more than $9 billion per annum. The Murray-Darling Basin covers or approximately one-seventh (14%) of the total area of Australia. Over two million people live in the Basin. == References == Category:Rivers of Australia Category:Regions of Australia Category:Biosphere reserves Category:Drainage basins",
