The Caliber was the replacement of the Dodge Neon. It was built on the Chrysler PM/MK platform which was also used on the Jeep Compass, Jeep Patriot, and Mitsubishi models as well. The Caliber was discontinued in 2012 and replaced by the Dodge Dart, which was a badge engineered sedan used on Alfa Romeo models. == References == Category:Dodge automobiles",
