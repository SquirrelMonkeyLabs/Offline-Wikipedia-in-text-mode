 "text": "The Hadejia River (known as kogin Ha…óeja in Hausa language) is a river in northern Nigeria and is a part of the Yobe River (Komadugu Yobe). The river flows through Hadejia and Nguru. Water from the river has been held back in a process called damming for the purposes of irrigation. This has reduced the amount of water in the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands, which the river forms along with Nguru Lake. The Hadejia river is now 80% controlled by the Tiga and Challawa Gorge dams in Kano State. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Rivers of Nigeria",
