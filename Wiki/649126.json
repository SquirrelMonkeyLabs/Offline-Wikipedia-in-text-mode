His best years were played with the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Mets. Piazza is regarded by many as the best offensive (hitting, batting) catcher of all time. He holds many batting records among catchers, such as most career home runs (427) and seven seasons hitting 30 or more home runs. Despite allegations of using anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, Piazza was eventually elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016. ==Other websites== * Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:American baseball players Category:Sportspeople from Pennsylvania",
