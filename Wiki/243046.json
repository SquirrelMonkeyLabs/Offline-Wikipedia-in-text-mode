 "text": "Parliament Hill (in ) refers to a set of buildings in Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada, where the Government of Canada meets and Members of Parliament make laws. It is called Parliament Hill because it is on a hill above the Ottawa River. There are three main buildings: the West Block, the East Block and the Centre Block. A fire in 1916 burned the Centre Block and only the library was saved. The building was rebuilt and the Peace Tower was finished in 1927. The roof of each building is made of copper which turns green over time. There are many statues around Parliament Hill including many former Prime Ministers and 5 famous women who helped women gain equal rights in Canada. There is also a centennial flame that was lit when Canada turned 100 years old. ==Other websites== *The website for Parliament Hill Category:Buildings and structures in Ottawa",
