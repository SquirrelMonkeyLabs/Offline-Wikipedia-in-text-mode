 "text": "Praha hlavní nádraží is the largest railway station in Prague, Czech Republic. It opened in 1871 as Franz Josef Station, named after Franz Joseph I of Austria. During the First Republic and from 1945 to 1948 the station was called Wilson Station (), after the former President of the United States Woodrow Wilson. In 2014, the station served 224,505 trains (610 daily) and more than 53,000,000 passengers. ==Overview== The Art Nouveau station building and station hall were built between 1901 and 1909, designed by Czech architect Josef Fanta. It replaced the earlier Neo-Renaissance station designed by Czech architects Antonín Viktor Barvitius and Vojtěch Ignác Ullmann. The station was extended by a new terminal building, built between 1972 and 1979, including an underground metro station and a main road on the roof of the terminal. In 2011 a partial refurbishment of the station was completed by Italian company Grandi Stazioni, which had leased retail space for 30 years from 2002. In 2016 Grandi Stazioni lost the concession after failing to complete the renovation of the historic building by the extended contractual deadline. In September 2021, a second exit was opened connecting the station to Winston Churchill Square in Žižkov via an underpass. The station was where the children left who were evacuated to London Liverpool Street station via the Port of Harwich by Nicholas Winton. In 2009 a statue was unveiled on platform 1 commemorating this. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Europe Category:Rail transport in the Czech Republic Category:Buildings and structures in Prague Category:1871 establishments in Europe",
