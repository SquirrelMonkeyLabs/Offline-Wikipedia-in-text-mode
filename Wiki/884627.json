 "text": "A mace is a wooden, metal-reinforced or metal shaft, 3 or more feet long, with a head made of iron or steel adding another foot to 18 inches to the length of the weapon. The head is normally about or slightly thicker than the diameter of the shaft, shaped with flanges, knobs or spikes to allow greater penetration of armour. It, like the warhammer and different other weapons of the time, came about because of the increased use of more effective armor on the battlefield. == Etymology == The word \"mace\" comes from the French \"masse\" (short for Masse d'armes). == Development == === Prehistory === The mace was created in the Upper Paleolithic from the club. The club had spikes of flint or obsidian. There was a problem with early maces, though. The stone tips would shatter easily and it was difficult to fix the handle reliably. === Ancient history === The Persians used a variety of maces. For a knight, a mace was as effective as a sword. The ancient Romans didn't make wide use of maces. == Related pages == * Leedsichthys == References == # \"Ninurta\". World History Encyclopedia.
