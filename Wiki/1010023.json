 "text": "Traumatology (from Greek trauma, meaning injury or wound) is the study of wounds and injuries caused by accidents or violence to a person, and the surgical therapy and repair of the damage. It is often linked to orthopedic surgery. Psychological traumatology deals with the mental problems caused by accidents or violence. These problems may happen to a person who is close to someone who has been damaged, even if they have not themselves been injured. Post-traumatic stress disorder is not an uncommon reaction. Head and neck injuries require the most care after surgery and are most likely to cause death and disabilities. ==References== Category:Emergency medicine",
