Scientists saw the frog between 300 and 600 meters above sea level. Two of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Bahuaja-Sonene National Park and Manu Biosphere Reserve. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. In some places, humans change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for cows to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
