 "text": "The Luzon limestone forest frog (Platymantis biak) is a frog. It lives in the Philippines on Luzon Island. Scientists have seen it in one place: Taft Forest on Samar Island, 140 m above sea level. The adult male frog is about 32.3 to 39.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 37.4 - 42.4 mm long. This frog has a larger body and larger disks on the ends of its toes than other frogs in Platymantis. It has a mark on its back like the letter W, but it is not always easy to see. This frog lives in places with a lot of karst rock and limestone. Unlike some other frogs in Platymantis, it lives on the ground. It does not climb trees much. ==Name== The word biak is Tagalog for \"crag\" (rock that sticks out) or \"crevice\" (big crack in rock). It is called the Luzon limestone forest frog in English because it lives on Luzon Island where there is limestone rock. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
