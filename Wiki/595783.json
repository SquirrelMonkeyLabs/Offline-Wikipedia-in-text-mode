 "text": "Ivan John Clark (1 November 1932 - 6 July 2023) was an English actor, director, producer and playwright. He was born in London. Clark is probably best known for his role as Just William in theatre and radio in the late 1940s and as the former husband of actress Lynn Redgrave, to whom he was married for 33 years. However, he is best known as a stage actor and director after moving to the United States in 1960, and became known for his theatrical directorship of plays featuring Redgrave in the 1970s such as A Better Place at Dublin's Gate Theatre (1973), The Two of Us (1975), Saint Joan (1977â€“78), and a tour of California Suite (1976). In 1981, he co-directed the CBS television series House Calls, which Redgrave starred in alongside Wayne Rogers. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1932 births Category:2023 deaths Category:English movie actors Category:English television actors Category:English stage actors Category:English radio actors Category:English playwrights Category:English television directors Category:English television producers Category:Actors from London Category:Writers from London",
