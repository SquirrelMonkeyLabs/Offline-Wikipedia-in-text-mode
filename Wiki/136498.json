 "text": "The United States Postmaster General is the executive head of the United States Postal Service. The office, in one form or another, is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General, serving slightly longer than 15 months. In 1971, the United States Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service, a special agency independent of the executive branch. Thus, the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in line to be President. == Postmasters General under the Continental Congress == Name Date appointed Benjamin Franklin July 26, 1775 Richard Bache November 7, 1776 Ebenezer Hazard January 28, 1782 == Postmasters General under the U.S. Constitution, 1789–1971 == Name State of Residence Date appointed President(s) served under Samuel Osgood New York September 26, 1789 Washington Timothy Pickering Massachusetts August 12, 1791 Washington Joseph Habersham Georgia February 25, 1795 Washington, Adams, Jefferson Gideon Granger Connecticut November 28, 1801 Jefferson, Madison Return J.
