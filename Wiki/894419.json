 "text": "Smulpaj (crumb pie) is a Swedish dessert. Unlike normal pies, the pie dish is greased first. A crumbly dough made of butter, sugar, wheat flour and oatmeal and placed on top is used instead of a pastry shell. Smulpaj is commonly made with apples, rhubarb, or bilberries, and served with whipped cream, vanilla sauce or ice cream. ==References== Category:Pies Category:Desserts",
