It contains 93.75% table salt and 6.25% sodium nitrite. The sodium nitrite in curing salt is used to stop the growth of Clostridium botulinum in order to prevent botulism. Curing salt may be dyed pink preventing it from being confused with table salt. ==Related pages== *Pickling salt *Table salt ==References== Category:Food ingredients",
