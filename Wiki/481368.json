 "text": "The squamosal is a bone of the head of higher vertebrates. It is the main part of the cheek region in the skull, towards the back and lower part of the skull. In mammals, including humans, it fuses with other bones to form the temporal bone. It is then called the 'squama temporalis'. In therapsids (including mammal ancestors) the lower jaw is simplified into just the dentary. This hinges against the squamous part of the temporal bone. It is referred to as a 'dentary-squamosal jaw'. == References == Category:Bones Category:Bones of the skull",
