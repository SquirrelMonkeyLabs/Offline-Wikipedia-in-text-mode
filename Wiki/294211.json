 "text": "The Status of Indian cities has two Government of India ranking systems used to pay workers more in some cities. There are two allowances; Compensatory City Allowance (CCA) to pay more because it is more expensive to buy things in cities. CCA is divided into categories A-1, A, B-1 and B-2. House Rent Allowance (HRA) is the second additional payment. It is divided into categories A-1, A, B-1, B-2 and C. This plan was first based on the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission of India (1997). City statuses were later changed based on the results of the 2001 Census of India. The following list classifies several Indian cities based on their CCA and HRA statuses. http://finmin.nic.in/the_ministry/dept_expenditure/miscellaneous/hracca.pdf __NOTOC__ CCA classification HRA classification City A-1 A-1 \"Upgradation of Bangalore as A-1 class city for the purpose of House Rent Allowance/Compensatory ( City) Allowance\".
