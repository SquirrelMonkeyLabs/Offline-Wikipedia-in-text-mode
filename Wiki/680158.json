 "text": "Jerry Lamon Falwell Jr. (born June 17, 1962) is an American attorney and university administrator. He was the president of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He was appointed in 2007 after the death of his father and resigned as president of Liberty University after a series of personal scandals. Falwell announced his endorsement for Donald Trump as Republican in the 2016 Presidential Election on January 26, 2016. That caused several Liberty University alumni and other Christians to become concerned that Falwell had \"sold his soul.\" In an August 19, 2016 editorial in The Washington Post, Falwell compared Trump to Winston Churchill. He said: \"We need a leader with qualities that resemble Winston Churchill. And I believe that leader is Donald Trump.\" In August 2017, after the Unite the Right protests in which a counter-protester was killed, Falwell defended President Trump, saying that the President doesn't have \"a racist bone in his body\". In 2020, Giancarlo Granda publicly discussed his relationship with Jerry Falwell and his wife Becki Falwell, which contributed to Falwell's outster from Liberty University. Falwell was born in Lynchburg, Virginia. ==References== Category:American Baptists Category:People from Lynchburg, Virginia Category:1962 births Category:Living people",
