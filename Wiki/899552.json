Some areas in Sullivan also use the Fall Branch ZIP code. ==History== One of the earliest settlers at Fall Branch was Isaac White. He was a Revolutionary War veteran who arrived in the area in 1781. He eventually established a farm at what is now the intersection of Interstate 81 and State Highway 93. Another early settler, Gabriel Morgan, built a grist mill at Fall Branch in the early 1800s. The mill stood until the 1930s, when it was torn down.\"History of Fall Branch ,\" Fall Branch Historical Society website. Retrieved: 25 July 2015. By the early 1800s, Fall Branch was known as \"Crouch Town\", after a family of early settlers. The name had changed to \"James' Cross Roads\" by 1830, when a post office was established. The name \"Falls Branch\" had been adopted by 1854, and the \"s\" was dropped from \"Falls\" in 1883, giving the community its current name. The name was inspired by the waterfall the community's main creek, also called Fall Branch, spills over just before it empties into Horse Creek. In 1836, Fall Branch was designated as the county seat of the proposed \"Powell County\", which would have consisted of parts of Washington, Greene, Sullivan, and Hawkins counties. While voters approved of the new county, it was rejected by the Tennessee Supreme Court on the grounds that it failed to meet the minimum size required by the state constitution for new counties.Bob Cox, \"A History Mystery: What Happened to Powell County? ,\" Johnson City Press, 19 August 2013.Bob Cox, \"History Mystery: More Specifics about What Happened to Powell County ,\" Bob Cox's Yesteryear, 23 September 2013.Andrew Johnson, LeRoy P.
