 "text": "Saturn (1936 – 22 May 2020) was an American alligator. He lived in the Moscow Zoo. He was known as an urban myth that he was Adolf Hitler's \"pet alligator\". He was born in the state of Mississippi, United States. He survived the Berlin bombing. Saturn was brought to the Berlin Zoological Garden. It was here that Hitler reportedly enjoyed visiting the zoo and especially liked the alligator. However, while Hitler may have viewed Saturn at the zoo, he was never Hitler's personal pet. During World War II, the Berlin Zoo was destroyed, but Saturn was discovered by British soldiers, who then gave the alligator to the Soviets in 1946. He lived at the Moscow Zoo until 22 May 2020, when he died of old age at the age of 83–84. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Individual animals",
