 "text": "Life expectancy at birth in Canada was 79.3 years for men and 84 years for women in 2022. For people aged 65 it was 19.5 years for men and 22.3 years for women. This is a little better than average of OECD countries. 25% of Canadians have a body-mass index of 30 or higher—a measure of obesity. This is less than the 40% in the U.S.A, but twice the rate in Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Canada ranked 4th in the eleven countries for the number of suicides per 100,000 compared, with a rate of 11.8 per 100,000 compared to the U.S. rate of 13.9 which was the highest of the eleven wealthy countries. From 2000 to 2015, the number of preventable deaths caused by treatable health conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure or some cancers—dropped from 109 to 72 deaths per 100,000. Canada is suffering from the opioid crisis as fentanyl has replaced heroin. 13,000 people have died in British Columbia since 2016 when the local health authorities declared a state of emergency. This is the main cause of death in the province for people aged between 10 and 59. ==References== Category:Canada Can",
