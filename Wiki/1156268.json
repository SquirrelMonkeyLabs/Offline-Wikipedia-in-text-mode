The Green City is built on the same platform as the Hyundai Aero City. == First Generation - Global 900 (2002-2004) == The first version of the Green City was called the Hyundai Global 900. It was introduced in 2002. The Global 900 was available with two engine types: a diesel engine from Mercedes Benz and a CNG engine made by Hyundai. ===New Global 900 (2004-2008)=== In 2004, the Global 900 got an update. It had a new diesel engine, called the Hyundai DB9A, which made 260 horsepower. The CNG version kept the same engine. In 2005, the bus also came in a version for tourists. A driver protection feature was added in 2006. ===New Global 900 Facelift (2008-2010)=== In 2008, the bus got a new look. It replaced the power antenna with a loop antenna. The diesel version now had stronger engines: the D6GA (250-255 hp) and the D6GB (260 hp). The CNG version still used the same engine. == Green City (2010-2024) == In 2010, the bus was renamed the Green City. It had some changes, including a new CNG engine that met Euro 4 standards. The bus also got new flooring. In 2011, the Green City added CD audio and MP3 players. By 2012, a new G260 Euro 5 engine was added. In 2015, a stronger G280 Euro 6 engine with 280 hp was available. In 2017, the Green City added ultrasonic sensors, call buzzers, and USB ports for the audio system. == Markets == The Hyundai Green City was mainly sold in South Korea. It was also available in other countries, including China and some Southeast Asian nations. The bus was used in both city transportation and tourism services. == Discontinuation == In 2023, it was announced that the Green City would be discontinued in 2024. This was because all new buses in South Korea must have a low-floor design. The Green City was a high-floor bus, so it will no longer be made. 현대차, 내연기관 시내버스 안 만든다 ET News (January 2, 2024) == References == Green City Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles",
