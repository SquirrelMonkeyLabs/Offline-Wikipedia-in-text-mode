 "text": "The Marriott World Trade Center was a 22-story steel-framed hotel building with 825 rooms. It opened in July 1981 as the Vista International Hotel and was located at 3 World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York City, with the World Trade Center complex. The hotel was destroyed as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, after the collapse of the Twin Towers. The hotel was not replaced as part of the new World Trade Center complex, but will rather share its name with the new office tower. The Vista International was the first hotel to open in Lower Manhattan since 1836. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. ==References== Category:September 11 attacks Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
