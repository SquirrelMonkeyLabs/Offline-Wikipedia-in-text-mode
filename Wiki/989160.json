 "text": "Ronald de Jong (1962 — 12 January 2023) known as Rooie Ron (translated “Red Ron”) was a Dutch soft drugs trafficker. ==Biography== De Jong was born in Amsterdam and grew up there. In the early 1990s, De Jong earned a lot of money trading large quantities of weed. As a driver he transported the weed and also smuggled it to the United Kingdom. The police and Public Prosecution Service saw these and other drug transports, but let it go in order to get to the top of the criminal organization with leaders like Mink K. and Stanley Hillis. This became known as the IRT Affair. It caused commotion in 1993 because police officers also turned out to be dealing in drugs and earning millions themselves. There came a parliamentary investigative into these controversial investigative methods, led by politician Maarten van Traa. He had a verdict in 1996 that also led to a stricter legislation. De Jong later had legal proceedings about money laundering of the money he had earned from the drug trade. In 2017, the court convicted De Jong of money laundering, after a lengthy procedure. He was sentenced to six months in prison and his villa was confiscated. In 2018, the Court of Appeal acquitted him of money laundering. However the Public Prosecution Service appealed in cassation and the Supreme Court sent the case back to the Court for a new appeal. De Jong died in Spain on 12 January 2023 from a long illness, at the age of 60. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:2023 deaths Category:Drug traffickers Category:Dutch people",
