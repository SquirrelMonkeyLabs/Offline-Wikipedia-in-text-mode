 "text": "The Indonesian bubble-nest frog, wine-coloured tree bubble-nest frog, or Javan jelly-nest frog (Feihyla vittiger) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains, only north of the Palakkad Gap. People see this frog near small bodies of water on mountains between 950 and 1219 meters above sea level. People have also seen it on farms for pine trees and tea. The female frog lays eggs on plants over the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the pond. She lays about 52 eggs at a time. Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. Human beings have cut down the trees in the forests where it lives to build farms. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Mount-Halimun-Salak National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
