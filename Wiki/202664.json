 "text": "In chemistry, a nitride is a compound of nitrogen with a less electronegative element, attached together in a specific way. Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications. Most of the names for nitrides follow a simple pattern: the name of the element attached to the nitrogen, then \"nitride\". So, GaN would be gallium nitride. There are some exceptions, however, for the compounds that has had a usual name before. For example, NH3 is not called hydrogen nitride, even if it is the most simple of this class of molecules, but it is still commonly called ammonia. Category:Nitrogen compounds Category:Anions",
