 "text": "NHL 14 is an ice hockey video game. It was developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. It was released on September 10, 2013 in North America, September 12, 2013 in Australasia, and on September 13, 2013 in Europe. The game was the 23rd in the NHL video game series and is the sequel to NHL 13. New Jersey Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur is shown on the cover of the game. This is the first time since NHL 97 that a goaltender has been featured on the cover. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 8.3 out of 10. They said, \"With much better collisions and a vastly improved fighting minigame, NHL 14 is becoming more gamey and less of a simulation, but that gives it a distinct and interesting flavor compared to its predecessors.\" GameSpot gave the game a 6 out of 10. They said, \"NHL 14 adds little of note to NHL 13 aside from better hitting, more fighting, and a disappointing NHL 94 retro mode.\" ==References== Category:2013 video games Category:NHL (video game series) Category:Electronic Arts video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Xbox 360 games",
