Candace Owens believes that black people should leave the Democratic Party to become Republicans. Candace Owens dislikes political correctness and says that she is not a feminist because today’s definition of feminism is hatred of men. Candace Owens says that left-wing people blame everything on white people and call everyone that they dislike racist. Candace Owens says that to call a black person a race traitor is racist. Owens has filmed a Prager University video saying that when it comes to politics no one should care what famous people think and another Prager University video in which she says that to say an opinion about racism is more important if a black person has it is “playing the black card” and that playing the “black card” is racist. While working at Prager University, she interviewed a lot of people including Dan Crenshaw, Dennis Prager, Steve Bannon, Michael Knowles, Larry Elder, Dave Rubin and Carl Benjamin. Owens left Prager University to work for The Daily Wire but was fired for saying things about Jews that the Daily Wire said were anti-Semitic.
