 "text": "The Nigeria women's national football team, known as the Super Falcons, plays for Nigeria in women's international football. It's managed by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). This team is the most successful women's football team in Africa. They have won the Women's Africa Cup of Nations eleven times. They won their latest title in 2018 by beating South Africa in the final match. This team is also unique because it's the only women's team from the Confederation of African Football that has made it to the quarterfinals in both the FIFA Women's World Cup and the Summer Olympics. They're also one of the few teams worldwide and the only African team to qualify for every FIFA Women's World Cup. Their best performance was in the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup when they reached the quarterfinals. == References == Category:Football in Nigeria Category:African women's national association football teams Category:National sports teams of Nigeria",
