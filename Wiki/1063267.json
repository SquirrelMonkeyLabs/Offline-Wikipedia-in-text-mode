 "text": "Ferdinand IV (; 16 June 1285 – 7 September 1312) nicknamed the Summoned () or the Warrior () was the King of Castile and León from 1295 until his death in 1312. At the age of 10, Ferdinand succeeded his father, King Sancho IV in 1295 with Ferdinand's mother, Queen María de Molina, serving as his regent until Ferdinand's 17th birthday on 16 June 1302 where he was crowned and where he also married Constance of Portugal. Like his predecessors, Ferdinand was active in the Reconquista and was considered a great, brave and also a strong king as well. Although he failed to conquer Algeciras in 1309, he captured the city of Gibraltar that same year, and in early 1312, the city of Alcaudete was also conquered by Ferdinand and his troops. Also just like his predecessors, Castile was thriving during Ferdinand's reign as well. Ferdinand died in Jaén after suffering from Tuberculosis on 7 September 1312 at the age of 27, and he was buried in the Royal Collegiate Church of Saint Hippolytus and was succeeded by his one-year old son, Alfonso XI.
