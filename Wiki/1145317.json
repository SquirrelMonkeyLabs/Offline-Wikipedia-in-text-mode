 "text": "Add oil is a Hong Kong English expression used to encourage and support someone, similar to saying \"Go for it!\" in English. The phrase is a Chinglish translation of the Cantonese term ga yau (, literally \"add oil\") and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2018. == Etymology and history == The Cantonese phrase ga yau (), with ga (加) meaning \"add\" and yau (油) meaning \"oil\" or \"fuel\", is thought to have originated as a cheer during the Macau Grand Prix in the 1960s. Drivers and fans used it to imply stepping harder on the gas pedal, urging vehicles to accelerate faster. This encouragement gradually became a metaphor, encouraging individuals to \"fuel up\" with motivation and effort. The phrase's popular usage has grown over time due to the influence of bilingual Hongkongers who use both Cantonese and English. Due to its frequent use in Hong Kong’s text-based communication, the English translation, \"add oil,\" became widely popular. In October 2018, the Oxford English Dictionary recognized its significance as a phrase of encouragement specific to Hong Kong English and traced its usage to at least 1964. == Usage == \"Add oil\" serves as a versatile and supportive expression in everyday speech, commonly used to encourage someone in sports, academics, or personal challenges. For instance, one might say, \"Add oil, you can do it!\" or \"Add oil, Hong Kong!\" === Popularity in protests === The phrase gained international attention during the Umbrella Movement in 2014, where the \"Add Oil Machine,\" a digital wall along Gloucester Road in Hong Kong, was used to project messages of support for the protesters. It allowed people worldwide to post messages of encouragement. \"Add oil\" was also used extensively in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests as a rallying cry, often displayed on Lennon Walls, symbolic public message boards for expressions of solidarity. == In popular culture == \"Add oil\" has been used in various contexts, including slogans and messages in sports events and during exams or challenging situations in Hong Kong. It is a common phrase found in schools, workplaces, and even advertisements. == Related pages == * Chinglish * Umbrella Movement == References == == Other websites == * Oxford English Dictionary entry on \"Add Oil\" * South China Morning Post article on \"Add Oil\" Category:Hong Kong Category:English words and phrases",
