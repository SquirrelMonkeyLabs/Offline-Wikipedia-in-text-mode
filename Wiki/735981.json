 "text": "A bay horse is a horse who is reddish brown with black points (legs, mane and tail). Bay horses can be light or dark brown. Sometimes their black points are covered by white markings (spots). Bay horses have dark skin. However, if they have white markings, they have pink skin under them. Very dark bay horses might look black, but the hair around their eyes is lighter than true black horses' hair. The shades with the least amount of colour are called wild bays. Wild bays have full reddish coat colors. They also have black manes and tails. The black points only go up to a part of a horse's foot or the horse's joint. Wild bay sometimes have a trait called \"pangare\". Horses with pangare have a pale color under their belly and soft places. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Horses",
