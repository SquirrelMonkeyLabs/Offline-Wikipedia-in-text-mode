 "text": "The German Spaniel, also known as the Deutscher Wachtelhund (which means German quail dog in German), is a medium size spaniel type of gun dog that was developed in Germany around 1890. ==Colours== These dogs are usually brown/red coloured and may have some white marks, they have a wavy coat of hair and look very similar to their cousin, the Field Spaniel. ==Temperment== German Spaniels are rarely kept only as pets as these dogs are almost always used as hunting dogs and, like all spaniel hunting dogs, require a lot of excercise. However, they are usually gentle but brave and can make good pets around people and other dogs if trained at a young age. ==Numbers== German Spaniels are quite rare outside of their native country with only around 100 dogs registered in North America as of 2013. ==References== Category:Spaniels Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in Germany Category:Rare dog breeds",
