 "text": "The Ryukyu Kajika frog, Japanese Buerger's frog, or Japanese streams frog (Chirixalus japonica) is a frog. It lives in Japan's Ryukyu Islands and in Taiwan. This frog is small and thin. The adult male frog is 25 - 30 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 27-37 mm long. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. There is only a little webbed skin on the front feet but a lot of webbed skin on the back feet. This frog lives between 0 and 300 meters above sea level, from forests near sea level to forests on mountains. This frog sits on the ground or near rocks. It almost never climbs trees. The female frog lays eggs in streams where the water moves slowly. She lays the eggs one by one instead of in a group. Sometimes she lays eggs in hot springs. The tadpoles can live in water as hot as 41.6Â°C. This is the hottest temperature of any tadpole of any frog. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place, much of which is in protected parks. In some places, the frogs die because people change the places where it lives to build roads and other things that people need. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
