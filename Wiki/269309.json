Gel or cream are terms often used of a semi-solid. Normally semi-solids are covalent in their chemistry. Covalent substances get softer and softer until they melt. Ionic substances melt at one temperature and do not get softer. Butter is a semi-solid when it is warm. Butter does not hold its shape but it does not flow like a liquid. Paint is also a semisolid, since it is highly viscous.
