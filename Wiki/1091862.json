 "text": "The frilled tree frog or Malay frilled tree frog (Kurixalus chaseni) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. People have seen it between 0 and 500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that have been cut down and have had a long time to grow back. This frog lives in swamps with water that does not move. Scientists think that this frog can live in places that have been changed. People have seen this frog next to roads. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms for palm oil. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
