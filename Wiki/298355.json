 "text": "Whisky made in Scotland is known as Scotch whisky, or simply as \"Scotch\" (especially in North America). It means the whisky is distilled in Scotland. It is usually a blend of malt and grain whiskies, and aged in barrels ('casks') for at least three years (four years for exports). Single malt scotch is made only from malted barley and no other grain, sugar, or fermentable material. They are made at the same distillery and not blended with any other scotch. Most single malt scotches are aged an average of 8 to 12 years. Category:Whisky",
