 "text": "The starry leaf frog (Phyllomedusa coelestis) is a frog that lives in Peru and Colombia. Scientists think it may live in many more places than we think. Scientists have seen this frog between 200 and 1000 meters above sea level. This frog is 53.3 to 64.8 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog is green in color with some white or orange spots. Its belly is orange. The pupils in its eyes go up and down and open side to side. It has small disks on its toes for climbing. People usually see this frog at night. It does not live near ponds. Most of the frogs scientists have seen were in forests that had been cut down and grown back with many streams and dense undergrowth: There were many bushes and other small plants under the trees. Scientists have seen the female frog lay eggs in a folded leaf hanging over the water. Scientists do not think this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
