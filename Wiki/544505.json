 "text": "Seven-Eleven, also spelled \"7-Eleven\", \"Seven-11\" or \"7-11\", is an international brand of convenience stores. In 2021, there were over 78,000 stores in the world. There are 7-Eleven stores in 19 different countries. The first 7-Eleven store was in the city of Dallas. The company that owns it, Seven-Eleven Japan Co., Ltd., is located in Tokyo. Seven-Eleven Japan is held by the Seven & I Holdings Co. holding company. ==Name == The company's first stores were named \"Tote'm Stores\" because customers \"toted\" (carried) away the things they bought. Some stores had totem poles in front of the store. In 1946, the brand's name was changed to \"7-Eleven\" because it was open from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm. In November 1999, the company's name was changed from \"The Southland Corporation\" to \"7-Eleven Inc.\" ==History== In 1927, Southland Ice Company employee John Jefferson Green sold eggs, milk, and bread from one of 16 ice house storefronts in Dallas. One of Southland's founding directors, Joe C. Thompson Sr., let him do this.\"7-Eleven, Inc. History\" Retrieved July 20, 2012. Even though other stores sold these things, Thompson thought that selling things such as bread and milk at convenience stores would make it easier for people to get what they need. Thompson bought the Southland Ice Company and turned it into Southland Corporation. The Southland Corporation controlled many places in Dallas.\"7-Eleven History\" Retrieved July 20, 2012. In 1928, a manager named Jenna Lira brought a totem pole from Alaska and placed it in front of her store. The pole was a marketing tool for the company, as it gained a lot of attention. Soon, executives added totem poles in front of every store. There was an Inuit-inspired theme for the stores. Later on, the stores used the name \"Tote'm Stores.\" In the same year, the company created gas stations in some of its Dallas locations to see if they would make money. Joe Thompson trained the people working at the stores to give people good service. Southland made a uniform for its ice station service men. This became a big part in the company's success as a convenience store. In 1931, the Great Depression happened. It almost made the company lose all of its money. However, the company went through re-organization and receivership to stop this. A Dallas banker, W.W. Overton Jr., also helped to bring it back by selling the company's bonds for a very low price. This made the company become controlled by of a board of directors. In 1946, to help the company grow, the name of all the stores were changed to 7-Eleven to adjust to the stores' new hours of operation, 7 am to 11 pm. In 1969, 7-Eleven made a 24-hour store in Austin, Texas after an Austin store stayed open all night to serve customers. Later on, 24-hour stores were created in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1971, Southland bought convenience stores of the former Pak-A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman, Sr. (1903–1985), of Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1964, with the purchase of 126 Speedee Mart franchised convenience stores in California, the company entered the franchise business. The company signed its first area licensing agreement in 1968 with Garb-Ko, Inc. of Saginaw, Michigan. Garb-Ko became the first US local area 7-Eleven licensee. In the late 1980s, Southland Corporation was threatened by plans for a corporate takeover. The Thompson family turned the company into a private model by buying out public shareholders in a tender offer. In December 1987, John Philp Thompson, the chairman and CEO of 7-Eleven, completed a $5.2 billion management buyout of the company. The buyout suffered from the effects of the 1987 stock market crash. The company had to offer stocks to get people to buy the company's bonds. Many things, such as the Chief Auto Parts chain, the ice division, and hundreds of store locations, were sold between 1987 and 1990 to pay off loans that were taken out during the buyout. This also meant that, in many big cities, 7-Eleven stores were sold to other convenience stores. In October 1990, the Southland Corp., who owned money, filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy to give control of 70% of the company to Japanese company Ito- Yokado. Southland exited bankruptcy in March 1991, after Ito-Yokado and Seven- Eleven Japan gave them $430 million. These two Japanese companies now controlled 70% of the company. The Thompson family kept 5%. In 1999, Southland Corp. changed its name to 7-Eleven, Inc., because they sold every store other than 7-Eleven. Ito-Yokado formed Seven & I Holdings Co. and 7-Eleven became its branch in 2005. In 2007, Seven & I Holdings expanded its American operations, and made 1,000 more 7-Eleven stores in the United States. For the 2010 rankings, 7-Eleven climbed to the Number 3 spot in Entrepreneur Magazine's 31st Annual Franchise 500, \"the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world.\" This was the 17th year 7-Eleven was named in the top 10. Also in 2010, the first \"green\" 7-Eleven store opened in DeLand, Florida. The store has U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design elements. The environmentally-friendly design helps the store save money on energy costs. That same year, 7-Eleven went mobile with the launch of the Slurpee drink's iPhone and Android Application (App). The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7-Eleven stores and gives driving directions. In 2011, 7-Eleven celebrated its 40,000th store opening and within two years of that goal opened its 60,000th store. In 2020, 7-Eleven bought Speedway for $21 billion. ==Products and services== 7-Eleven in the United States sells Slurpee drinks, a partially frozen soft drink introduced in 1965, and Big Gulp drinks, made in 1976.\"At 7-Eleven, the Big Gulps Elude a Ban by the City\", by Aaron Edwards, The New York Times, June 6, 2012 [consulted 2015-11-17].\"The Tall, Cold Tale of the Big Gulp Thanks to 7-Eleven, large will never be the same\", by Robert Klara, Adweek, February 16, 2015 [consulted 2015-11-17].

In the mid-1990s period, 7-Eleven in Sweden received adverse publicity due to the unfavourable labour contracts offered by its then-licensee, Small Shops, an American-based company, resulting in many stores being sold and closed down.

The majority of stores are in metropolitan areas, particularly in central business district areas. Stores in suburban areas often operate as petrol stations and most are owned and operated as franchises, with a central administration. 7-Eleven bought out Mobil's remaining Australian petrol stations in 2010, converting them to 7-Eleven outlets, resulting in an immediate and unprecedented overnight major expansion of the brand. 7-Eleven stores in Australia sell a wide range of items, including daily newspapers, drinks, confectionery, and snack foods. They also sell gift cards, including three types of pre-paid VISA cards. The chain has also partnered with BankWest, placing a BankWest ATM in each of their stores nationwide.

The first store was opened on October 30, 2014 in the city of Fremantle. =====Wage scandal===== In August 2015, Fairfax Media and the ABC's Four Corners program found out about the employment rules of certain 7-Eleven stores in Australia. They found out that many 7-Eleven employees were being paid from A$10 to A$14 per hour without adding tax, under the minimum of A$24.69 per hour. They did this by having pay records that looked like they were paying them the rate, however these records would only show half of the hours that the employee worked in a week. Employees would then be paid on the basis of these records, resulting in them effectively being paid half of how much they worked. It was also reported that workers were often not paid things that they legally have to be paid for, for working extra, night time, weekends, and holidays. After everyone saw these reports, some employees told Fairfax Media that they were paid high amounts, however would then be asked by the store to give half of it back. 7-Eleven said they would pay to find out about wage fraud. A separate panel led by ACCC chairman Allan Fels would investigate the fraud, with the support of professional services firm Deloitte. The inquiry will invite submissions from current and former 7-Eleven employees who allege they have been underpaid, and assess each individual claim. In September 2015, chairman Russ Withers and chief executive Warren Wilmon both announced they will stop working at the company. Deputy chairman Michael Smith replaced Withers, while Bob Baily temporarily replaced Wilmon. ==References== ==Other websites== * * 7-Eleven global sites index * Category:Fast food Category:Retail markets Category:1927 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in Texas Category:1920s establishments in Texas",
