 "text": "Oomph! is a German rock band from Wolfsburg that was made in 1989. The band started the Neue Deutsche HÃ¤rte style (a style of rock music). Their works have lyrics in German and English. They use mostly German on their recent albums. (Some of their songs, such as: GlaubeLiebeTod, Monster, Des Wahnsinns fette Beute, XXV and Ritual are in German only). ==History== ===Early years (1989-2002)=== Oomph! used many styles of music such as metal, industrial, alternative rock, electronica, and gothic metal to make their sound. Their style has changed between their self-titled debut album, Oomph! (1992), and the album after it called Sperm (1994). They started with a very dance-heavy industrial sound. They quickly moved to a much heavier guitar-driven metal sound. However, they still recognize their electronic roots. This guitar- driven and electronic accompanied sound inspired many musicians, most famously Rammstein, Megaherz, and Eisbrecher. Oomph! was signed on Virgin Schallplatten between 1998 and 2001. They released three albums; the first, Unrein, was released in 1998. This was their debut album on the German Media Control Charts, peaking at No. 37, and the Austrian top 40 at No. 38. A single called \"Gekreuzigt\" was released in 1998 to promote Unrein. It was the band's debut single on the German charts, peaking at No. 81. The second Virgin Schallplatten album, Plastik, was released in 1999 and ranked in Germany at No. 23. The third, Ego, was released in 2001, going as high as No. 21 on the Media Control Charts. They finished their contract with Virgin Schallplatten. The band felt that they never fully explored their potential. They did not continue with the record company. With the benefits of major-label status, Oomph! gained more fans and toured with labelmate Skunk Anansie in 1999. They later opened for Finnish rock band HIM in the fall of 2001. In 2002, Oomph! played at the Ozzfest in Germany. They played with the Black Label Society, Tool, and Ozzy Osbourne on 20 May. The band appeared at the With Full Force Festival on 5 July 2002. On 19 December 2002, Oomph! opened for Apoptygma Berzerk. == References == Category:German rock bands",
