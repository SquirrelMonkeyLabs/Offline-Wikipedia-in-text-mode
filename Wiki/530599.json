 "text": "Michael Edward \"Mike\" Duggan (born July 15, 1958) is an American lawyer, prosecutor and businessman. He is serving as mayor of Detroit, Michigan. He was elected mayor in 2013. He received attention from across the country in part because he is the first white mayor of the city since Roman Gribbs in the early 1970s. Currently, most of the people living in Detroit are African American. This was not the case at the time when Gribbs was mayor. In November 2024, Duggan announced that he would not seek reelection as mayor. The following month, Duggan announced his independent campaign for governor of Michigan in the 2026 election. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from Detroit Category:Businesspeople from Detroit Category:Mayors of Detroit Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Independent politicians in the United States",
