 "text": "Vedic astrology, also known as Jyotisha (), is the traditional Hindu system of astrology, with its origins in ancient Indian scriptures called the Vedas. It is one of the six Vedangas, or ancillary disciplines of Vedic literature, and plays an important role in Hindu religious and cultural practices. == Etymology == The Sanskrit word Jyotisha is derived from jyoti (light or celestial body) and isha (lord or knowledge), and is often translated as the \"science of light\" or \"knowledge of the heavens.\" == History == The roots of Vedic astrology date back to the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE), which contains hymns referencing celestial phenomena. The system was later formalized in classical texts such as the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra (attributed to sage Parashara), and the Brihat Samhita by Varahamihira (6th century CE). Over centuries, Vedic astrology evolved to incorporate elements of myth, astronomy, and philosophy.Pingree, David. Jyotiḥśāstra: Astral and Mathematical Literature. Otto Harrassowitz, 1981. == Core Concepts == === Grahas (Planets) === Vedic astrology recognizes nine primary celestial influences, known as the grahas: * Surya (Sun) * Chandra (Moon) * Mangala (Mars) * Budha (Mercury) * Guru (Jupiter) * Shukra (Venus) * Shani (Saturn) * Rahu (ascending lunar node) * Ketu (descending lunar node) === Rashis (Zodiac Signs) === The zodiac is divided into 12 signs (rāśis) beginning with Mesha (Aries) and ending with Meena (Pisces). Unlike Western astrology, Vedic astrology uses the sidereal zodiac, which aligns with the constellations rather than the equinoxes. === Bhavas (Houses) === The astrological chart is divided into 12 houses (bhāvas), each representing different aspects of life, such as personality, wealth, relationships, and career. === Nakshatras (Lunar Mansions) === The zodiac is further divided into 27 (sometimes 28) nakshatras, or lunar mansions, which offer more nuanced astrological interpretations. == Divisional Charts == Vedic astrology utilizes multiple charts known as divisional charts to analyze specific aspects of life. The most commonly used include: * Navamsa (D9) – for marriage and spiritual path * Dasamsa (D10) – for profession * Saptamsa (D7) – for children == Dashas and Transits == === Dasha Systems === The Vimshottari Dasha system is a widely used predictive tool in Vedic astrology. It divides a human lifespan into planetary periods ruled by the nine grahas, each influencing the native's life in a specific way.Kapoor, Subodh. Encyclopaedia of Ancient Indian Sciences. Cosmo Publications, 2002. === Gocharas (Transits) === Gocharas are the transitory movements of planets through the zodiac. Astrologers analyze these in conjunction with dashas to forecast outcomes and suggest remedies. == Applications == Vedic astrology is applied in: * Personal life guidance * Kundali matching (compatibility for marriage) * Determining auspicious dates (Muhurta) * Health and medical astrology * Political and financial forecasting == Comparison with Western Astrology == Vedic astrology differs from Western astrology in several key areas: * It uses the sidereal zodiac instead of the tropical zodiac. * Greater emphasis is placed on the Moon sign, nakshatras, and planetary periods (dashas). * Divisional charts and lunar nodes play a larger role in analysis. == Scientific Reception == Vedic astrology, like other forms of astrology, is considered a pseudoscience by the mainstream scientific community. Studies have shown no statistical validity to astrological predictions.Cornelius, Geoffrey. The Moment of Astrology: Origins in Divination.
