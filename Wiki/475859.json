 "text": "Bäckaby Old Church () was a woooden church building in Sweden. The oldest pieces were dated back to the 1320s. The old wooden church was originally in Bäckaby outside Vetlanda. The church was later purchased by a private person and moved to the town park in Jönköping. In Jönköping, it was reopened on 31 August 1902. Back in Bäckaby, Bäckaby Old Church had been replaced by the newer Bäckaby Church in 1899. On late Friday evening, 28 April 2000 a fire totally destroyed the church. Soon, it was learnt that the fire was caused by arson. Local press brought major attention to the fire when it appeared to be connected to satanism. and modern paganism. Many people missed the church because it had been popular a place for weddings and baptism. In 2003 a memorial site was opened. ==Related pages== *Kulla Chapel ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Fires in Sweden Category:Church of Sweden churches Category:Wooden churches Category:Buildings and structures in Jönköping Category:14th-century buildings and structures",
