She is best known for her time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s as well as her time in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in mid-1990s. She is better known under her ring name Miss Elizabeth. She was known for managing \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage who she was also married to from December 1984 to 1992. Later on, she began dating Lex Luger. They were planning on getting married. On April 19, 2003, she was involved in a domestic dispute with Luger where he allegedly hit her in the garage of their townhouse in Marietta, Georgia. The Cobb County police found her with two bruised eyes, a bump on her head, and a cut lip. On May 1, 2003, Luger called 9-1-1 because Hulette was not breathing. After Hulette did not respond to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the paramedics rushed to their townhouse but they pronounced her dead. It was later announced by a medical examiner that Hulette had died from \"acute toxicity\" which was brought on by a mix of painkillers and vodka. ==Awards== *World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment **Slammy Award for Woman of the Year (1987) ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1960 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Drug-related deaths in the United States Category:Female professional wrestlers Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets Category:Sportspeople from Louisville, Kentucky Category:WWE people",
