 "text": "A Piłsudskiite () was a political supporter of Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the founder of the WWI Polish Legions and the first Chief of State of the Second Polish Republic. The Piłsudskiites had a major influence on the politics of Poland during the interwar period from 1918 to 1939. Piłsudski was highly influential, never dropped out of public life, remained active in Polish politics and exercised considerable influence until his death in May 1935. His special position was highlighted by the position of the General Inspector of the Armed Forces, which was created specifically for him and was responsible not to the Sejm (Polish Parliament) but only to the President. In May 1926, Piłsudskiite forces conducted the May Coup, deposed the legally-elected government and installed their own. The Sanacja (\"Sanation\") political camp was formed, and Piłsudski's power grew. The Sanacja began to strengthen its own power and to curb the activities of opposition political parties. Many parties then became Piłsudskiite to get closer to power and stay safe from potential problems. When Piłsudski died in May 1935, the Sanacja lost its leader. The political situation in Poland became radicalised, and the pressure of opposition camps on the ruling Sanacja became stronger. To unite the Piłsudskiites and hold on to power, the leading Piłsudskiite politicians formed the Camp of National Unity. To gain voters from the opposition party National Democracy, the Camp of National Unity radicalised its program and even took some issues from the opposition camp such as becoming more nationalist. Still, it advocated Piłsudski's points of view and followed his political heritage. ==Related pages== * Poland * Sanation * Józef Piłsudski * Second Polish Republic Category:Politics of Poland",
