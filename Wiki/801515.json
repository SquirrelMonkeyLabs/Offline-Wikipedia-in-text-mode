 "text": "Vice President-elect of the United States is the title used for an incoming vice president of the United States between the general election on Election Day in November and noon Eastern Standard Time on Inauguration Day of January 20. During this time, the elected nominee is not in office yet. The term corresponds to the term \"president-elect of the United States\", used for those elected president of the United States for the same period between their election and inauguration. If the current vice president has won re-election alongside the current president, they are not given the title of vice president-elect because they are already in office and is not waiting to become vice president. == Vice President-designate of the United States == Since 1967, the vice presidency has been vacant twice, and a successor was nominated to fill the vacancy in with the 25th Amendment. The first was in 1973 when Gerald Ford was nominated by President Richard Nixon to succeed Spiro Agnew, who had resigned. The second came in 1974, when Ford, who had succeeded to the presidency following Nixon's resignation, nominated Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him. During both vacancies, the nominee was called vice president-designate, instead of vice president-elect, as neither had been elected to the office. == List of vice presidents-elect == Vice President- elect Party Election Inauguration 1 John Adams Nonpartisan Election of 1788â€“89 George Washington's first inauguration 2 Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican Election of 1796 John Adams's inauguration 3 Aaron Burr Election of 1800 Thomas Jefferson's first inauguration 4 George Clinton Election of 1804 Thomas Jefferson's second inauguration 5 Elbridge Gerry Election of 1812 James Madison's second inauguration 6 Daniel D.
