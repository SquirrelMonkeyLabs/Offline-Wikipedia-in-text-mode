 "text": "Tidal energy, sometimes called tidal power, is using the energy of moving water in tides and open ocean currents. It is most used for hydroelectricity. Tidal energy systems can take kinetic energy (energy caused by movement) from the moving water of rivers, tides and open ocean currents. They can also use potential energy from the difference in height between high and low tides. Getting energy from tidal currents is becoming more popular because people believe that it does not harm the environment as much as barrages or dams. Many coastal sites around the world are being checked to see if they can be used to produce tidal energy. Like other hydroelectricity (electricity made using water), tidal power makes no pollution and is a renewable energy source. It is renewable because tides are caused by events that happen in the solar system and so will not run out. Tidal power has great potential for future power and electricity generation because of the very large amount of energy contained in these systems. Tidal power is reliably predictable (unlike wind power and solar power). In Europe, tide mills have been used for nearly 1,000 years, mainly for grinding grains. Modern tide mills provide tidal stream power. Many things affect tides. The pull of the Moon is the largest effect, and most of the energy comes from the slowing of the Earth's spin. == Sources == * Baker, A.
