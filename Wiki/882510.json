 "text": "\"More popular than Jesus\" is a comment made by John Lennon of the Beatles in a March 1966 interview. He argued that the public knew and loved the Beatles more than Jesus. He also said that the Christian faith was not as strong because of rock music. His opinions became controversial when originally published in the London newspaper The Evening Standard, but drew angry reactions from Christian communities when republished in the United States that July. In August 1966, Lennon expressed regret for having compared the band's popularity to that of Jesus. ==Notes== ==References== Category:John Lennon",
