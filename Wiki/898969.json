It began in Saada in Northern Yemen in the 1990s. The Houthi movement is a Zaidi Shia majority force. Under the leadership of Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, the group was an opposition to former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh and participated in the Yemeni Revolution, while being allied with regional Islamist militant groups like the Hamas * * * * * * * * * * * and Hezbollah. ==History== Since October 2023, the Houthis have been engaged in the Red Sea Crisis. ===2024=== On January 6, Houthi launched an attack on the USS Laboon, a destroyer in the United States Navy.
