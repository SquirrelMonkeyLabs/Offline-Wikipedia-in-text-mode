 "text": "Jørn Stubberud (born 13 April 1968) is a Norwegian musician. He is known for being the bassist for the black metal band Mayhem. When playing with the band, he uses the name Necrobutcher. He helped make Mayhem with Euronymous and Kjetil Manheim. He is the only original member still in the band. This is because Manheim left Mayhem in 1988, and Euronymous was killed in 1993. Stubberud has also played in other bands, such as L.E.G.O. and Kvikksølvguttene. == Mayhem == Necrobutcher joined the band in 1984. He left the band in 1991 after the band's singer, Dead, killed himself. He was also having problems with Euronymous, another member of the band. When Necrobutcher left Mayhem, Varg Vikernes joined the band to play bass guitar. Vikernes killed Euronymous in 1993. In 1995, Necrobutcher started the band again. He made it with Hellhammer, Maniac and Blasphemer. As of 2022, he is still in the band. In 2018, he made a book about the band. It is named The Death Archives: Mayhem 1984–94. == References == Category:1968 births Category:Living people",
