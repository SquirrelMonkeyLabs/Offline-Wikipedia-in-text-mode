The museum is at 200 Eastern Parkway, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Arnold L. Lehman is the museum's Director. The Brooklyn Museum has more than one-and-a-half million objects. Some of these pieces of art are from as long ago as ancient Egypt while others are very recent. The museum is a 560,000 square foot (52,000 m²), Beaux-Arts building. Approximately 500,000 people visit the museum each year. == History == The Brooklyn Museum was started by Augustus Graham in 1897. The building has a steel frame It was designed by McKim, Mead, and White and built by the Carlin Construction Company. Daniel Chester French, the man who made the Lincoln Memorial, made two allegorical figures, Brooklyn and Manhattan (carved in 1916, and moved to the museum in 1963), and of the figures on the building. Thomas S. Buechner was made the museum's director in 1960. Buechner made a large change in the way the museum displayed the art. Also one thousand pieces of art that had been in the museum's archives were put back on display.Grimes, William. \"Thomas S.
