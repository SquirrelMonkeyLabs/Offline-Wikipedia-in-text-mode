 "text": "An octobass, also known as an octuple bass, is a musical instrument. It is a giant bass with three strings. It is played with a bow like a double bass. Handles attached to the side of the octobass can press down on the strings when pulled. It has the deepest sound of any string instrument. There are only seven octobass in the world and they are mostly in museums. The only full working octobass is the one in the Montreal symphony orchestra, making it the only orchestra in the world to have an octobass. Category:String instruments",
