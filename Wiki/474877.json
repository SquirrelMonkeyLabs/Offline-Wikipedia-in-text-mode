Windows 10 was announced at a press event on 30 September 2014. It was released for personal computers on 29 July 2015. It is a free update for Windows 8 that can be found in the Windows Store until version 1709. Windows 10 is designed to provide the same look for different systems. These include desktop, laptop, and other systems. Unlike earlier versions of Windows, Windows 10 was regularly updated with new features based on user feedback, starting before it was first released. Each release has a four-digit build number. The first two digits (2 numbers) refer to the year of release, and the other two digits refer to the month of release (e.g. \"1903\" refers to a build released in March 2019). Windows 10, is by now, the most popular Windows version, at 71.1%. Older versions of Windows 10 (any version before 22H2) are officially discontinued and do not get updated, and Windows 11 is 2nd most popular. == New or returned features == Feature Present in Windows 8.1 Present in Windows 7 Remarks/Improvements Return of the Start menu No Yes It is a mix of Windows 8's Start screen with Live Tiles and Windows 7.

This feature was first available for Ubuntu and OS X. Tablet mode Partial No Used on multi-mode (convertible) devices like Microsoft's Surface Pro 3.

However, starting in February 2018 this was switched to the modern lifecycle policy (excluding LTSC), with each build receiving 18 or 30 (only for H2 versions) months of support after release, depending on edition. Furthermore, Home edition does not support the deferral of feature updates and will thus often receive a new version of Windows 10 prior to the end of the 18-month support period. Microsoft's support lifecycle policy for the operating system notes that updates \"are cumulative, with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it\", that \"a device needs to install the latest update to remain supported\", and that a device's ability to receive future updates will depend on hardware compatibility, driver availability, and whether the device is within the OEM's \"support period\"‍a new aspect not accounted for in lifecycle policies for previous versions. This policy was first invoked in 2017 to block Intel Clover Trail devices from receiving the Creators Update, as Microsoft asserts that future updates \"require additional hardware support to provide the best possible experience\", and that Intel no longer provided support or drivers for the platform. Microsoft stated that these devices would no longer receive feature updates, but would still receive security updates through January 2023. Microsoft will continue to support at least one standard Windows 10 release until October 14, 2025. On April 27, 2023, Microsoft announced that version 22H2 would be the last of Windows 10, meaning this version will extend beyond the normal 18/30 months of support. While the company aimed to discontinue support for Windows 10 by October 2025, it announced an Extended Security Update (ESU) service in December 2023 for Windows 10 devices, until October 2028, for a yet to be announced annual pricing plan. Furthermore, unlike previous Windows ESU services, Windows 10 ESU will be available to individual consumers as well. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Microsoft operating systems",
