 "text": "A midterm exam is a test given around the middle of a term in schools. ==Purpose== Midterm assessments serve a dual purpose, aiding in both gauging your current comprehension of course material and priming you for forthcoming final exams. They offer an opportunity to assess your progress, pinpoint areas for improvement, and refine study strategies, ultimately enhancing your preparedness for the culmination of the academic term. == Format == Midterm exams come in various formats, encompassing multiple-choice, short answer, fill-in-the-blanks, or essay-type questions. The structure might differ from one course to another, contingent upon your professor's preferences. Some midterms occur during regular class hours, while others are designated as take-home exams. Critical information regarding the midterm, including its format and scheduling, is typically outlined in the course syllabus. ==References== Category:Examinations",
