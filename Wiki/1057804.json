When K class No. 19 returned to the WAGR after working under the Public Works Department (PWD) to shunt at Fremantle as No. 19. In 1899, it was assigned to the Goldfields Water Supply Administration/department for the construction of the Mundaring Weir Branch Line, returning to the WAGR in 1903 and renumbered 5. In 1910, it was sold to the Fremantle Works Department for the construction of Fremantle Dock, before returning to the PWD in 1913 for the construction of the Hotham Valley Railway (Pinjarra to Boddington) and named Hotham. It continued to work on many construction projects around Western Australia until 1926 when it was sent to Midland Railway Workshops and scrapped. At some point during its later PWD career, it was fitted with a G class tender in place of its bunker. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
