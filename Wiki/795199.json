 "text": "The windward slope is the side of a mountain, island or other land which the wind hits. The windward direction is the direction upwind from the point of reference. That means windward is the direction from which the wind is coming. If the wind is moving from north to south, then the windward slope is the north side of the hill or mountain. Leeward is the direction downwind from the point of reference. The leeward side of a mountain is usually drier than the windward side. ==References== Category:Geography Category:Weather",
