 "text": "The Kaiten (Japanese: 回天, translated \"Change the World\" or \"Reverse Destiny\") was a torpedo that was changed to become a suicide weapon, and used by the Navy of the Empire of Japan in the last months of the Second World War. It was basically a torpedo with a pilot, and it could be thrown from a submarine or a ship. The Kaiten was not very effective. Out of more or less 100 attacks made with them, only two enemy ships were sunk. ==Related pages== * Submarine * Kamikaze * Ohka ==Other websites== *Kaiten Memorial Museum *Kamikaze Submarine *USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park *US Navy Historical Center *Pictorial account of types 1 and 2 kaitens *The Kaiten Mark II at the New Jersey Naval Museum in Hackensack, NJ * Humantorpedo 回天 Kaiten (Japanese) * Category:Weapons",
