He works for the World Wrestling Federation/WWE since 1990. He is a three-time World Heavyweight Champion and four-time WWE Champion. Calaway made his debut with Dallas, Texas based World Class Championship Wrestling. In 1988 he joined USWA. He began working as the Undertaker for the WWF at the Survivor Series pay-per-view in 1990 on Ted DiBiase's team. His team won the match, though The Undertaker was eliminated by count-out. Undertaker did not lose a match that entire year. He also won the WWF Championship. Soon after, he suffered his first championship loss after a match against Hulk Hogan for the title. Undertaker has a 25-2 record at WrestleMania. After 23 years of being undefeated at the event, he lost his first WrestleMania match against Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX in 2014, and his second one against Roman Reigns three years later at WrestleMania 33. He announced his retirement from professional wrestling in 2020 at Survivor Series, almost exactly 30 years after his WWE debut. Despite this, he still sometimes appears for WWE, for example in the main event of WrestleMania XL in 2024. == In wrestling == *Finishing moves **WWE ***Tombstone Piledriver (Kneeling reverse piledriver).
