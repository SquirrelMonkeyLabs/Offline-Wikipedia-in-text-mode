 "text": "Dog food is food made for dogs. Dogs are omnivores but they like to eat meat. They have sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for meat than vegetables. Their feeding habits evolved as they lived with humans in agricultural societies and ate scrap leftovers and excrement from humans. Dogs' ability to digest carbohydrates easily may be a key difference between dogs and wolves. The first food was made specifically for dogs in the nineteenth century, Spratt's Patent Dog Biscuit. In the United States people spent around $23.3 billion in 2022 on dog food. ==References== Category:Foods by type Category:Dogs",
