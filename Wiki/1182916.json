Chingiz-Khan turned westwards to lay siege to Taliqan, a town in the mountains of Juzjan, probably to be identified with the present-day Chachaktu. From the edge of the city moat, Tolui proclaimed that the inhabitants would be spared if they surrendered. Unlike at Merv, the Mongols honoured their word, only killing the 12,000 men in the city garrison. Having appointed a Mongol overseer to govern the town, Tolui left the region to rejoin his father at Taliqan in mid-1221. == References ==",
