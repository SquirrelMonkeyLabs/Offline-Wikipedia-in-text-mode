 "text": "Brisbane City Council (BCC) is a local government authority for the City of Brisbane, a local government area (LGA) representing most of Brisbane and the largest LGA in Australia. The Brisbane City Council acts a bit like a unicameral (single-chamber) parliament, similar to the Queensland Parliament or the two territory parliaments. It has 27 councillors, 26 of which are elected from one of the 26 wards of Brisbane, while the remaining one is the Lord Mayor, who is directly elected. Elections are held every four years. ==Current composition== Party totals Party Wards Lord Mayor Liberal National 19 1 Labor 5 Greens 1 Independent 1 The current council is Ward Party Councillor Lord Mayor LNP Adrian Schrinner Bracken Ridge LNP Sandy Landers Calamvale LNP Angela Owen Central LNP Vicki Howard Chandler LNP Ryan Murphy Coorparoo LNP Fiona Cunningham Deagon Labor Jared Cassidy Doboy LNP Lisa Atwood Enoggera LNP Andrew Wines Forest Lake Labor Charles Strunk Hamilton LNP David McLachlan Holland Park LNP Krista Adams Jamboree LNP Sarah Hutton MacGregor LNP Steven Huang Marchant LNP Fiona Hammond McDowall LNP Tracy Davis Moorooka Labor Steve Griffiths Morningside Labor Lucy Collier Northgate LNP Adam Allan Paddington LNP Clare Jenkinson Pullenvale LNP Greg Adermann Runcorn LNP Kim Marx Tennyson Independent Nicole Johnston The Gabba Greens Trina Massey The Gap LNP Steven Toomey Walter Taylor LNP James Mackay Wynnum Manly Labor Peter Cumming ==Notes== ==References== Category:Brisbane Category:City councils Category:1920s establishments in Australia Category:Unicameral legislatures",
