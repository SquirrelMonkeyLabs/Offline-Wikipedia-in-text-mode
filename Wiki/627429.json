 "text": "The Karlmann King is a low-production SUV that is manufactured in Italy and the United States. The price starts at $1.85 million, for the standard version. It is the most expensive SUV in the world. It features a 6.8-liter V10 engine which produces 398 horsepower but because the Karlmann King weighs an abnormally heavy 10,580 pounds (without armor), its top speed is only 87 mph. The car features optional bullet-proofing. Only 9 units will be built in Italy and a larger, unknown quantity will be built in the United States, in a modified and more standardized version. Other features include independent air-conditioning for the front and rear, a coffee machine, neon sky lighting, a flat-screen TV, electric tables, air purification, a bar, a laptop, and a fridge. All of the electric features can be controlled from a control panel in the dash or from inside or outside the vehicle via an app. Entertainment options include a Hi-Fi sound system, a PlayStation 4, phone projection, satellite TV, and Wi-Fi. ==References== Category:Sport utility vehicles",
