 "text": "Chatroulette is a webcam chatting site founded by Andrei Ternowski in November 2009. Two people are randomly connected. At any time, one of the people can end the chat by pressing F9 on their keyboard. According to Robert J. Moore, the CEO and co-founder of RJMetrics, about 1 in 8 people are either naked or lewd. Many people think children should not use it. Since December 2012, users can only use their webcam if they have had at least 3 conversations that lasted 10 minutes or longer. If a user didn't do that yet, their webcam will display a picture. Also, a person has to register before using it. If someone acts strange or offends another person, you can report him/her by keyboard. ==Related pages== *Omegle ==References== ==Other websites== * Chatroulette.com * Thatroulette.com (list of Chatroulette clones) Category:Russian websites",
