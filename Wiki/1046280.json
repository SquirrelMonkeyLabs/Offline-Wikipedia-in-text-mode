 "text": "On September 12, 2023, Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced an impeachment inquiry into president Joe Biden. ==Background== Three committes will run the investigation: the House Judiciary Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight committee, will lead the investigation. On September 1, 2023, McCarthy promised in an interview with Breitbart News that he would hold a floor vote on opening an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. The inquiry happened even though the U.S. House investigation into Biden and some family members, had not found evidence of wrongdoing by the president. McCarthy started the impeachment inquiry to because the far-right-wing members of the House's narrow Republican majority said they would vote him out as speaker if he did not. On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221â€“212 to create an official impeachment inquiry against Biden related to the business deals of his son, Hunter. ==Responses== Some Republican members of Congress, including Shelley Moore Capito, Mitt Romney, Ken Buck, Dave Joyce, and Don Bacon, said that they have not seen any evidence that could justify an impeachment inquiry. Biden said that he was not focused on the impeachment inquiry. He said that the Republicans \"want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government\". House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries promised to defend Biden \"until the very end\" and said that the impeachment inquiry was almost like a kangaroo court. == References == Category:Joe Biden Category:September 2023 events",
