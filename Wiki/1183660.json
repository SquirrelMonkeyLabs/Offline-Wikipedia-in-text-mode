A person from the Czech Republic named Tomáš Mariančík made it; his nickname is “Frooxius.” A company called Yellow Dog Man Studios operates it. Users can meet and talk to others using 3D avatars they create. They can visit 3D worlds made by other users. Users can also use different items and media. The game lets users build and share their own 3D things inside the world. This includes avatars, items to use, and whole places to explore. The community makes and shares everything inside of the game. Resonite works best with special glasses for virtual reality (VR). You need a Microsoft Windows computer. But you can also play it on a computer screen with a mouse and keyboard. This is called desktop mode. You can switch between playing in VR and playing on the desktop easily. ==References== Category:Linux games Category:Social casual games Category:Windows games Category:Virtual reality games Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Early access video games Category:Free-to- play video games Category:2023 video games",
