 "text": "GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter video game for the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS. It is a modern retelling of the GoldenEye movie, and a remake of the 1997 Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007. It was released in North America on November 2, 2010, in Europe on November 5, 2010, and in Japan on June 30, 2011. The game's main character is James Bond, Agent 007. A version of the game with better graphics and sound titled GoldenEye 007: Reloaded was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. While keeping the same gameplay as the Nintendo 64's GoldenEye 007, modern elements of first-person shooter games such as environments that can be destroyed and a health meter that fills up after a while of not taking damage are added to the game. Levels from the Nintendo 64's GoldenEye 007 have been changed due to the game's changed storyline. Players can use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination, the Wii Zapper, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, or Nintendo GameCube controller. The game features both local multiplayer for four players and online multiplayer for up to eight players. Online play is done through the free Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. ==References== Category:2010 video games Category:James Bond Category:Activision video games Category:First- person shooters Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Stealth video games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games based on movies Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii games Category:Wii Zapper games Category:Xbox 360 games",
