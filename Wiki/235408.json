 "text": "Elevated building foundation (EBF) is a kind of seismic base isolation technology which is made a major part of a building superstructure. It is made to protect the building's superstructure against damage from the shaking caused by an earthquake. This goal can be met with the right building materials, size, and setup of elevated building foundation for the building site and local soil conditions. As a result of multiple wave reflections and diffractions, as well as energy dissipation of the seismic waves as they move up through the elevated building foundation, any movement of seismic wave energy into the building superstructure will be decreased, which will lower seismic loads and improve seismic performance of the structure.Elevated Building Foundation and Earthquake protector: new features in passive structural control. In other words, the building does not shake as much because it is sitting on the elevated building foundation, and will probably take less damage from the earthquake. ==Notes== Category:Earthquake engineering en:Elevated building foundation",
