 "text": "Willie Hugh Nelson (; born April 29, 1933) is an American country music singer-songwriter, as well as an author, poet, actor, and activist. In 1961, a song that he wrote was recorded by Faron Young, and became a number one song on Billboard's Hot Country Songs music chart. In 1975, he had his first number one song, as a singer, on Billboards Hot Country Songs music chart.Wolff, Kurt; Duane, Orla (2000). Country Music: The Rough Guide. Rough Guides. ISBN 978-1-85828-534-4. ==Early life== Willie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression to Myrle Marie (n√©e Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April 29, 1933, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30\\. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. Nelson's ancestry includes English, Irish, and Cherokee. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson's grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic. His mother left soon after he was born, and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music.Reid; Jan p.218 Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, and when he was nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson didn't like picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age thirteen, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong. ==Personal life== Nelson is the co-chair of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advisory board. ==Discography== ===Singles=== * Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain (1975) * \"Always on My Mind\" (1982) ==Writing of songs== * Crazy (1961) * Christmas Blues ==Sources== Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:American country singers Category:American country guitarists Category:American movie actors Category:American songwriters Category:American television actors Category:Musicians from Texas Category:Singers from Texas",
