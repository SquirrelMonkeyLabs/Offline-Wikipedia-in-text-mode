It is a compound unit of torque corresponding to the torque from a force of one newton applied over a distance arm of one metre. A newton metre is dimensionally equivalent to a joule. ==Conversion factors== *1 metre kilogram-force = 9.8065 R/N·m *1 centimetre kilogram-force = 98.0665 mR/mN·m *1 foot-pound force (often \"foot-pounds\") = 1 pound-force foot (often \"pound- feet\") = 1.3558179 R/N·m *1 inch ounce-force = 7.0615518 mR/mN·m Category:SI derived units",
