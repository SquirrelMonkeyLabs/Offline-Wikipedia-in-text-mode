 "text": "Shopping is an activity where people seek and buy goods they want or need, with money. Large, indoor shopping malls became commonplace in the 1950s. People who go shopping visit shops. Those people are called \"shoppers\". They may go to buy things, or just to look. It is mostly explained like leisure. ==Characteristics== Often shopping means buying not just goods, but various services available in the same area, including entertainment (restaurants, cafes, cinema, etc.). In modern society, about a third of all goods are manufactured for the real needs of people, and the rest belongs to the \"optional\" group (new fashionable models of mobile phones, color \"tabloid\" magazines, \"super-cutters\", \"Fat burners\", etc.). In some places, shopping is considered an important activity or even a hobby. There is a television program called Shop till you drop. It is a game show for shoppers. As in the case of alcohol, drugs, gambling, the Internet, food, with a passion for shopping, a painful addiction called oniomania can develop, also named shopaholism. Psychologists confirmed that addicted people become dependent on doing shopping, being in a state of euphoria and thus reducing a level of stress. Currently, online shopping is becoming an important part in the retail industry. According to different studies, women are more involved in shopping â€” about 80% of consumers at all. ==Benefits== 1\\. Lifts your mood. Shopping is associated with a sense of achievement. Think about the time you scored a vintage necklace from your local neighborhood thrift shop. You were elated to find a piece of jewelry that was unique and within your budget. The heightened emotions of happiness release endorphins, known as the \"feel good\" chemicals in your brain. Endorphins help you refocus your mind on your body movements, improving your overall mood. 2\\. Lowers stress levels. When you shop, you socially interact with people around you - whether they're fellow shoppers or sales associates. In addition, shopping with a best friend, partner, or family member provides a bonding experience that can reduce stress levels. In a study published by the American Psychological Association (APA), levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, were tested in kids who were with their best friend versus kids who were alone during a negative experience. Kids who were with their best friends during a negative experience produced less levels of cortisol than their counterparts, which suggests any form of bonding can be good for the mind, body, and soul. 3\\. Mental activity The mental, physical, and social engagement of shopping can keep your perception intact even in old age. When you shop, you are physically active by walking, going up and down escalators, and trying on clothes. The mental component of shopping is introduced when you revise your budget, check which on-sale item is better, and calculate your total cost. Socially, you meet up with friends or you hold small-talk with an employee at a department store. It's essential to keep your mental acuity in focus as you age. Therefore, shopping can help prevent dementia, an illness that affects many adults in the beginning of their 60s. 4\\. Maintenance of health Daily shopping trips were linked to an increase in survival rate with the collection of data of approximately 2,000 elderly men and women aged 65 and over from Taiwan and the statistics of the country's National Death Registration from 1999 to 2008. \"For example, elders may maintain a mall walking routine, perhaps regarded as shopping activity, although more to do with the need to belong to a community or keep physically active in a safe and convenient environment,\" says the study. ==Related pages== * Mall ==References== Category:Society Category:Hobbies Category:Commerce",
