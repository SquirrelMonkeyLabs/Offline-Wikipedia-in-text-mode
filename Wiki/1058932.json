 "text": "The WAGR Ns class was a single suburban steam locomotive operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1922 to 1933. The Ns class resulted from the superheating of standard N class No. 263, using the boiler from Os No. 81. No. 263 was built by Nasmyth, Wilson & Coy in 1900. In 1933 it was reconverted by replacing the boiler, reverting No. 263 back into an N class. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
