 "text": "The Division of Macarthur is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It is named after John Macarthur and his wife Elizabeth, who were both pioneers of Australia's wool industry. It covers the outer south- west of Sydney. It includes the suburbs of Airds, Ambarvale, Appin, Badgerys Creek, Bickley Vale, Bradbury, Camden, Camden South, Campbelltown, Cawdor, Cobbitty, Ellis Lane, Gilead, Glen Alpine, Grasmere, Greendale, Harrington Park, Kentlyn, Mount Annan, Narellan, Oran Park, Rosemeadow, Rossmore, St Helens Park, Wedderburn and Woodbine and parts of Bringelly, Catherine Field, Douglas Park, Leumeah, Razorback and Rossmore. Over the years the size of the electorate has become much smaller. This is because of the increasing number of people living in the Campbelltown region. The towns of Bowral and Moss Vale and a large part of the Southern Highlands were removed from the division before the 2001 election. ==Members== Member Party Term Jeff Bate Liberal 1949–1972 Independent 1972–1972 John Kerin Labor 1972–1975 Michael Baume Liberal 1975–1983 Colin Hollis Labor 1983–1984 Stephen Martin Labor 1984–1993 Chris Haviland Labor 1993–1996 John Fahey Liberal 1996–2001 Pat Farmer Liberal 2001–2010 Russell Matheson Liberal 2010–present ==Election results== ==References== ==Other websites== *Division of Macarthur- Australian Electoral Commission Category:Electoral divisions of New South Wales Category:1949 establishments in Australia",
