 "text": "Benerib was a queen consort during the 1st dynasty of Egypt and the wife of Hor-Aha. \"Benerib\" means \"sweetheart\" == Biography == Benerib was married to the pharaoh Hor-Aha, but she was not the mother of his successor, Djer. The mother of King Djer is Khenthap, another wife of Hor-Aha.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), p.46 Benerib is believed to be the wife of Hor-Aha because items with his name were found in her tomb at Abydos. A piece of an ivory box with the names of Hor-Aha and Benerib was also discovered at Abydos and is now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.B. Porter and R.L.B. Moss. Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings, V. Upper Egypt: Sites. Oxford, 1937, pg 88,89 Egyptologist John Romer suggested that Benerib’s name, which can mean “sweetheart” or “one who is pleasant at heart”, might not be a name at all but rather a title or description for a person whose gender is also uncertain from the name. Benerib’s titles are unknown, and also the identity of her parents. Benerib was buried at Umm el-Qa'ab in tomb B14.B. Porter and R.L.B. Moss.
