 "text": "Grace Lee Boggs (June 27, 1915 â€“ October 5, 2015) was a Chinese-American social rights activist, philosopher, and author. She took part in numerous women's rights, civil rights, labor rights, environmental justice, and black power movements. Boggs got a Ph.D. in philosophy at the age of 25, which was very uncommon at the time, especially for a Chinese-American. In 1992, Boggs and her later husband James Boggs started a program called Detroit Summer, which was made as a recreation of the Freedom Summer Program (otherwise known as the Mississippi Summer Program), but for youths. The program was an opportunity for local youth to grow leadership skills and to empower them to improve their communities. In 2013, Boggs was featured in a PBS documentary \"American Revolutionary: The Evolution of Grace Lee Boggs\", which focused on her political views, actions, and steps she took to make a difference in the community and in the world. Boggs also founded an organization called the Boggs Center and helped start a charter school called the James and Grace Lee Boggs School a few years ago. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American centenarians Category:American feminist writers Category:Writers from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Writers from Queens",
