Natasha keeps saying that she has never had sex with a woman. Natasha and Alba get undressed and into bed, though Natasha is still nervous. Alba suggests they lay side by side and only casually touch each other's faces. They do that until Alba becomes so relaxed she falls asleep. Natasha quietly gets out of bed, gets dressed and leaves the room. She wonders what would have happened if she had given sex to Alba. But Natasha leaves one thing behind: her cell phone.
