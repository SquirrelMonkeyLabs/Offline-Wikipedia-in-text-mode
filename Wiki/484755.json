This series was written in 2006 and 2007. The Eternal Ones series is about a modern day high school girl who sees visions of herself, including one of her dying, in 1920’s New York City with a boy named Ethan Evans. After a lifetime of hearing and ignoring rumors of demons in her small town, she becomes involved with Iain Morrow in New York, who she thinks murdered her in a past life and is out to murder her again. These two books were written in 2010 and 2011. ==Values== Kirsten is set apart from other authors by emphasizing the importance of “girl power”. She has chosen many female lead characters because she believes girls can make a change too. She showed this by saying, “While the world wasn’t necessarily designed with young girls in mind, if a girl has a little ingenuity and a lot of confidence, she can make the world work to her advantage” in an teenreads.com interview in 2006. ==References== * \"Kirsten Miller.\" Contemporary Authors Online.
