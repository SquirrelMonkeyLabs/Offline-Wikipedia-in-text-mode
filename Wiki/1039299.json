He gained recognition for his expertise in negotiation and conflict management. One of his most significant contributions was co-writing the book \"Getting to Yes\" alongside William Ury. This book introduced the concept of \"interest-based\" negotiation, which focuses on finding common interests and solutions rather than engaging in adversarial battles.
