 "text": "Call of Duty 3 is a first person shooter video game. It is available on many gaming systems such as the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC. It is a sequel to Call of Duty 2, and is part of the Call of Duty series. Call of Duty 3 is set in France, during the time of World War II. The player is part of the allied forces placing charges, firing mortars, driving jeeps, and killing Nazis. The player moves by using the movement of his own hands. The game also features online play, which allows you to choose the side of allies or axis and play on a team against opposing players. ==Differences== While the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions support online headset, the PlayStation 3 does not support headset due to the game being rushed to be ported at the time and is ironic because the PS2 was released before the PlayStation 3. The Wii version does not support online play. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website * Category:2006 video games Category:Call of Duty Category:Activision video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Treyarch games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about the Special Air Service Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in France Category:Wii games Category:World War II video games Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox 360 games",
