 "text": "The Great Walls are the largest known structures in the universe. They are based on data set mapping of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The mapping found an unusually high concentration of similarly distanced GRBs in certain areas. Structures larger than 1,200,000,000 light years are incompatible with the cosmological principle according to all estimates. List of the largest cosmic structures Structure name (year discovered) Maximum dimension (in light years) Notes Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall (2014) 10,000,000,000 Discovered through gamma-ray burst mapping, and is the first structure to exceed 10 billion light years. Giant GRB Ring (2015) 5,600,000,000 Discovered through gamma-ray burst mapping. Largest known regular formation in the observable Universe. Huge-LQG (2012-2013) 4,000,000,000 Decoupling of 73 quasars. Largest known large quasar group and the first structure found to exceed 3 billion light years. U1.11 LQG (2011) 2,500,000,000 Involves 38 quasars. Adjacent to the Clowes-Campusano LQG. Clowes-Campusano LQG (1991) 2,000,000,000 Grouping of 34 quasars. Discovered by Roger Clowes and Luis Campusano. Sloan Great Wall (2003) 1,370,000,000 Discovered through the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex (1987) 1,000,000,000 Contains the Milky Way, and is the first galaxy filament to be discovered. (The first LQG was found earlier in 1982.) A new report in 2014 confirms the Milky Way as a member of Laniakea Supercluster. CfA2 Great Wall (1989) 750,000,000 Also known as the Coma Wall Laniakea Supercluster (2014) 520,000,000 Galaxy supercluster in which the Earth is located Horologium Supercluster (2005) 550,000,000 Also known as Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster. == References == Category:Lists Category:Cosmology",
