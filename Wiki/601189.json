 "text": "Dawn Therese Brancheau (née LoVerde, April 16, 1969 – February 24, 2010) was an American senior animal trainer at SeaWorld. She worked with orcas at SeaWorld Orlando for fifteen years, including a leading role in revamping the Shamu show, and was SeaWorld's poster girl. Brancheau was killed by an orca, Tilikum, becoming the only SeaWorld trainer killed by an animal. However, her death was the third fatality associated with Tilikum, and many other trainers have been seriously injured by orcas. ==References== Category:1969 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Entertainers from Indiana Category:Entertainers from Illinois",
