 "text": "The Methodist Church of Hungary is a Christian denomination in Hungary and part of the global Methodist movement. Methodism began as a revival movement within Christianity, focusing on personal faith, social justice, and helping others. == History == The Methodist Church began in the 18th century as a religious renewal movement within the Anglican Church. It focused on helping the poor and needy, inspiring many people to care about social solidarity and responsibility. The Methodist movement became separate from the Anglican Church after its leader, John Wesley, died in 1791, due to changing circumstances. Today, there are about 75 million Methodists in 108 countries worldwide. The Methodist Church has been present in Hungary since 1898, when the first Methodist preacher, Robert MÃ¶ller, came from Austria. The Methodist mission officially began in Hungary in 1905. After the Treaty of Trianon, the Budapest congregation was the only remaining Methodist community in Hungary. However, during the spiritual revivals after the two World Wars, the church's work expanded nationwide. Today, in 2024, there are about 40 congregations in 11 districts across Hungary. == Related pages == * United Methodist Church of Sweden * United Methodist Church * Methodism * John Wesley == References == Category:Methodism",
