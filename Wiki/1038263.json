 "text": "The Great Game was a strong rivalry between the British and Russian Empires over influence in Central Asia in the 19th Century. This rivalry mainly focused on Afghanistan, Persia, and later Tibet. Both empires used a mix of military force and diplomatic talks to gain both influence and control in Central and South Asia. The Russian Empire took control of Turkestan, while Britain grew its influence in the Region and set the borders of Britsh Colonial India. As the 20th century approached, a number of independent nations, tribes and monarchies from the Caspian Sea to the Eastern Himalayas became protectorates or came under direct control by the two empires. ==References== Category:19th century in Asia",
