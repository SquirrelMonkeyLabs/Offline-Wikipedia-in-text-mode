Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon, Karen Black, Rainn Wilson, Chris Hardwick, Tom Towles, Erin Daniels, Jennifer Jostyn, Walton Goggins, and Dennis Fimple are in it. The movie is about a group of teenagers who are kidnapped and tortured by a family on Halloween. Movies such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and The Hills Have Eyes (1977) inspired Zombie. He made House of 1000 Corpses while making a haunted house for Universal Studios Hollywood. He filmed the movie in Universal Studios and Valencia, California in 2000. Universal did not want to release the movie because they thought it would be rated NC-17. Zombie sold the movie rights to Lions Gate Entertainment, and they released the movie in April 2003. Many movie critics did not like it, but it made over $16 million. The movie has two sequels: The Devil's Rejects (2005) and 3 from Hell (2019). == References == Category:2003 movies Category:Movies directed by Rob Zombie Category:Lionsgate movies Category:American movies",
