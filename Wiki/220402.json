He was a member of the Republican Party. He began his life as a farmer, then became an innkeeper and finally became a banker before the Civil War. During the war, he received a brevet appointment as a general and saw action with the 25th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry. After the Civil War, he became a congressman in the United States House of Representatives. There, he became chairman of the Committee on Invalid Pensions. He was elected Governor of Wisconsin as a Republican in 1882. His most noted act during his governorship was when he sent the National Guard into Milwaukee to keep the peace during the May Day Labor Strikes of 1886. This led to the Bay View Tragedy, in which a number of workers were killed; Governor Rusk took most of the blame. In 1889 he resigned his post as governor and accepted the new cabinet position of Secretary of Agriculture in the Benjamin Harrison administration. He lived, died and was buried in Viroqua, Wisconsin. ==References== ==Other websites== * Retrieved on 2008-02-12 * Retrieved on 2008-02-12 Category:1830 births Category:1893 deaths Category:American Civil War generals Category:American bankers Category:Governors of Wisconsin Category:Politicians from Ohio Category:United States Secretaries of Agriculture Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:Military people from Ohio",
