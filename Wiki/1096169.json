He has also played for the Dallas Mavericks. He also plays for the Slovenia national team. On February 2, 2025, the Mavericks traded Dončić along with Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Max Christie, Anthony Davis and a 2029 first-round pick. Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round pick were also traded to the Utah Jazz. The Jazz also received a 2025 second-round pick from the Mavericks. Dončić did not expect the trade and it is considered to be one of the most unexpected trades in NBA history. Dončić can speak four languages: Slovenian, Serbian, English, and Spanish. He learned Spanish after joining Real Madrid. == References == Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:Dallas Mavericks players Category:Los Angeles Lakers players Category:Slovenian sportspeople Category:Sportspeople from Ljubljana",
