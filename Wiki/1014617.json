 "text": "The Tonkin bug-eyed frog, Kwangsi warty tree frog, or moss bug-eyed tree frog (Theloderma corticale) is a frog. It lives in China, Vietnam, and Laos. People have seen it between 470 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that have been cut down and are growing back. Sometimes they live near places where the ground is so steep that it is like a wall. People have seen this frog between 500 and 1320 meters above sea level. They see it on wet moss or inside holes in trees that have water in them. The female frog lays eggs in holes that have water in them. The tadpoles live in the holes until they become frogs. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and there are so many of them. It is in some danger because human beings change the places where it lives to make farms or build stop rivers to make electricity. But because it also lives in places that have lots of rocks and where the ground is steep, people do not always want to build farms there. Scientists think people might catch this frog to sell as a pet. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Nha-Ke Bang National Park, Tam Dao National Park, Nakai Nam Theun National Park, and Shiwandashan National Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
