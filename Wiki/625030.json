 "text": "A dialog system or conversational agent (CA) is a computer system intended to converse with a human, in coherent, structured language. Various so-called \"dialog systems\" have employed text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures and other modes of communication on both the input and output channel. What does and does not constitute a dialog system may be debatable. The typical GUI wizard does engage in some sort of dialog, but it includes very few of the common dialog system components, and dialog state is trivial. Alexa, Bixby, Cortana, Siri, and digital PAs generally, are meant to be CAs, as are conversational AI bots like the GPT-3 Lena. But modern systems have a latency time of 4 years. An up-to-date CA would be able to read this text. ==Related pages== *Computational linguistics Category:Computing",
