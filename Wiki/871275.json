 "text": "The Meira Paibi () are traditional women's social organisations and their movements in Manipur. Meira Paibi work against many different social evils. For example, they work against the cruelty of the Indian Army and the military in Manipur, India. They are called the \"Guardians of the society\". The name comes from the burning torches that the women carry. The torch has become the symbol of peaceful protest for justice at all levels of life. The meira paibi is the largest basic level, weaponless movement fighting with the state's inhumanity and human rights violations in Manipur. The women have always faced the strength of the armed forces with nothing other than their unity and will power for many decades. Sometimes the military will arrest a man even though they do not have proof or a good cause. These women's organisations stop these arrests. Generally, the meira paibi groups form in Imphal and other places in the valley of Manipur. The women patrol the streets, mainly at night time. They often constitute a large, unified and disciplined group at public gatherings, especially for protests. Today, every place where Meitei people live has meira paibi organisations. They did this to save Manipur from being a land of victims and unhappiness. The meira paibis also changed drug abuse patterns. == History == The Meitei women started the meira paibi movement in the 1970s in Manipur, India. They stood against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). Besides, they were also fighting against crimes against women and drugs abuse. In 1980, the entire Manipur state was brought under the AFSPA to conflicting rebellions. Many innocent young men were often arrested, tortured and killed. At this, the women demanded the removal of the act. Along with this, the group of women patrolled the streets to stop improper search operations by the security forces. Simultaneously, the women became the \"Wall protecting society against violence and killings\". In July, 2004, the meira paibi protests hit the global headlines when the 12 Meitei Manipuri women stood without clothes in front of the Kangla Fort. It was where the Assam Rifles (a unit of Indian Army) were stationed. There, they protested naked, carrying a banner that reads \"Indian Army Rape Us.\" They were protesting against the rape, torture and custodial killing of Thangjam Manorama, a young woman, by the Assam Rifles troops. == Public response == The meira paibis and the Meitei women should be the role model to every women to know their responsibilities and contributions in social welfare. After knowing this, the UNICEF says: > \"The Manipuri story indicates that active participation by women in public > affairs can and does contribute to better conditions for children and > society at large.\" In 2013, The Times of India awarded the \"TOI Social Impact Awards: Lifetime Contribution\" to the meira paibis of Manipur. == References == == Other websites == * Burning Bright Irom Sharmila Category:Women's rights",
