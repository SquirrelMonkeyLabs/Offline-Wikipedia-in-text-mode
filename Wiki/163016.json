 "text": "Newton's universal law of gravitation is a physical law that describes the attraction between two objects with mass. Sir Isaac Newton talked about it in his book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. The law is part of classical mechanics. The formula is F_g=G\\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}, In this equation: * F_g is the total gravitational force between the two objects. * G is the gravitational constant. * m_1 is the mass of the first object. * m_2 is the mass of the second object. * r is the distance between the centers of the objects. In SI units, F_g is measured in newtons (N), m_1 and m_2 in kilograms (kg), r in meters (m), and the constant G is approximately equal to . == References == Category:Mechanical engineering",
