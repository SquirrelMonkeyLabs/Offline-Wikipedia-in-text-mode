 "text": "Tromsø University College (Norwegian: ), or HiTø, was a college in Tromsø, Norway. It was made in 1994. It was made through merging four colleges: Tromsø Teacher College, Tromsø Maritime College, Tromsø Nursing College, and Northern Norway Music Conservatory. The college teached things like healthcare, engineering, business administration, teaching, and the arts. Students at Tromsø University College had access to healthcare, housing, and other things. In 2009, Tromsø University College became part of the University of Tromsø. The merger between Tromsø University College and the University of Tromsø was done to improve higher education in Norway. The goal was to simplify the system. This was done by bringing the two schools together. The University of Tromsø now offers undergraduate and graduate programs. They now teach different things like humanities, social things, nature, and technology. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Tromsø Category:Education in Norway Category:Colleges and universities in Norway Category:Buildings and structures in Norway",
