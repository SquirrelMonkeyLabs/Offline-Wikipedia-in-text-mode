 "text": "A residential institution or total institution is a home for people who can't live by themselves or in an ordinary roommate situation due to severe disability, age (below the age of majority if parents or guardians aren't present) because they committed a crime and thus must be put in prison, extreme poverty etc. Total institutions are highly structured with rigid hierarchies, stringent rules and schedules that regulate every aspect of life. Privacy and civil liberties are limited or non-existent in total institutions and there's a process of dehumanization in most types of facilities. The dehumanization usually includes things like stripping inmates of personal property (with the exception of things like approved medical devices), forcing them to wear uniforms, etc in an effort to enforce uniformity and discipline. ==Examples== Examples of residential institutions include * psychiatric hospitals * prisons * poorhouses and workhouses * college residence halls * military barracks * Remote work camps\\outposts worker housing * orphanages * assisted living homes * nursing homes Category:Social care Category:Accommodations",
