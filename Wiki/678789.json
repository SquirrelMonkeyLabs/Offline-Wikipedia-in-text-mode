 "text": "Bernie Sanders announced his 2020 United States presidential campaign via email on February 19, 2019. He made the announcement on Vermont Public Radio. This is his second run for the Democratic nomination, following his campaign in the 2016 primaries. He also announced his campaign in an email to his supporters on the same day. He entered into the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries as one of the front-runner candidates, as compared to his prior 2016 underdog campaign. His 2020 race has more advantages as his policy ideas accepted into the Democratic mainstream. In a crowded field of primary candidates, Sanders both leads in polling and has the largest fan base than his competition. Policies from his last campaign, such as single-payer healthcare and tuition-free public colleges, had since entered mainstream Democratic thought. In October 2019, the Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign gained the support of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Some of the main issues the campaign supports are: * Medicare for All - Guaranteed healthcare to all people as a right. * Green New Deal - Invest in renewable energy and create new jobs. * College for All - Make colleges and universities tuition free, and cancel all student debt. * Get Corporate Money Out of Politics - Such as by banning political donations from federal lobbyists and corporations. * A Responsible, Comprehensive Foreign Policy - Implement a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and peace, and economic fairness. * Jobs for All - enact a federal jobs guarantee. On April 8, 2020 one day after the Wisconsin primary, Sanders ended his campaign after failing to beat Biden in many primary contests after Super Tuesday. On April 13, Sanders formally endorsed Biden for the Democratic nomination. ==References== Category:Bernie Sanders Sanders",
