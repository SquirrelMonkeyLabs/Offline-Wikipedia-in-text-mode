He was hired by NASA, a month later. He worked at the Design Engineering Networks Communications section at Kennedy Space Center. In 1992, he graduated with his Masters Degree of Science in Electrical Engineering. In 1997, he went back to school for another Masters in Science degree. At the Kennedy Space Center, Soto Toro reviews, designs, builds, and tests engineering designs used in the Space Shuttle and Payload Operations Development Laboratories. The main project he developed was the Advanced Payload Transfer Measurement System. This system measures the spherical coordinates offset between the trunnion and their supports during transfer operations. ==Awards== Soto Toro was presented with the 2003 \"El Premio Coqui\" by La Casa de Puerto Rico in Florida for his assistance in the field of science. On November 9, 2003, Soto Toro was named the Grand Marshal of the Puerto Rican Day Parade held in Palm Bay, Florida. Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Puerto Rican engineers",
