It was announced on February 26, 2017, in the Mobile World Congress at Barcelona as the Nokia 3310 2017 Edition, debuting as a 2G smartphone. Nokia released the 3G model on October 29, 2017. == Launch == On February 14, 2017, it was reported that a newer version of the 3310 would be released at the 2017 Mobile World Congress that is held in Barcelona by HMD Global Oy, a Finnish manufacturer which made Nokia phones. The price was set to be 59 euros. On the 26th, the phone was relaunched at 49 euros. The first release of the phone only came with 2G support, which led to issues, especially as countries like the United States, Australia and Singapore were in the process of phasing out their 2G networks. A new version of the phone with support for 3G networks was later announced by HMD, and released on 29 October 2017. == Functions and design == The 3310 has things like an FM radio, the Opera Mini web browser, a voice recorder, and a 2-megapixel camera with flash for photos and video recording. The flash LED is also the phone's flashlight. Some models have Bluetooth 3.0 and a dual-SIM tray. The display has a polarized layer for outdoor use. The original Snake game has been replaced by Gameloft's Snake Xenzia with updated modes and graphics. It is also possible to sideload Java-based applications using the .jad and .jar format. Available apps are browsers, games, internet radios, etc. The design of the phone is very similar to the Nokia 3310. It comes in two glossy colors, red and yellow, as well as two matte colors similar to the original Nokia 3310: dark blue and grey. === 3G version === The 3G model has many differences apart from the 3G radio. The internal storage has been increased from 16 megabytes to 128 megabytes, and there are some cosmetic changes, including a new silver keypad. It comes in four new colors: yellow, \"warm\" red, azure and charcoal, all matte. The phone's size has slightly increased to make typing on the keypad easier. The radio has reduced battery talk time, but slightly increased standby time. All 3310 3G versions support Bluetooth 2.1. The 3310 3G also runs a Java-based operating system that HMD calls \"Smart Feature OS\". Its appearance is similar to the Series 30+ as on the 2G version, but has a new customizable interface. However, only sim-slot 1 is 3G compatible, the slot 2 is still only 2G capable. === 4G version === A 4G version was released in January 2018 in China in a partnership with China Mobile. It runs AliOS, a fork of Android, and can create Wi-Fi hotspots using the LTE data connection. Internal storage has been increased to 512 megabytes, and 64 gigabyte memory cards are now supported. == Reception == HMD announced on 2 July 2017 that the 3310 received great demand and was as a result sold out in many markets. UK retailer Carphone Warehouse said on 10 March that demand was \"astonishing\". The new 3310 received mixed reviews. CNET praised the phone's battery life, price, and durability, but Techradar and The Guardian said the device doesn't have many features that modern smartphones users are used to. Most reviewers liked the nostalgia of playing the iconic Snake game. Some counterfeit versions of the phone have been produced due to the model's popularity. == Variants == Variant Model Number Supported Network Number of SIM card supported Connectivity Platform SOC Source Nokia 3310 TA-1008 GSM 900/1800 1 WLAN No Bluetooth 3.0, A2DP GPS No Radio FM radio USB microUSB 2.0 Series 30+ MT6260 [1] Nokia 3310 Dual SIM TA-1030 GSM 900/1800 2 WLAN No Bluetooth 3.0, A2DP GPS No Radio FM radio USB microUSB 2.0 Series 30+ MT6260 [2] Nokia 3310 3G TA-1022 GSM 900/1800, WCDMA band 1/8 1 WLAN No Bluetooth 2.1, A2DP GPS No Radio FM radio USB microUSB 2.0 Feature OS SC7701B [3] Nokia 3310 3G (Dual SIM) TA-1006 GSM 900/1800, WCDMA band 1/8 2 WLAN No Bluetooth 2.1, A2DP GPS No Radio FM radio USB microUSB 2.0 Feature OS SC7701B [4] Nokia 3310 3G (Quad band) TA-1036 GSM 850/900/1800/1900, WCDMA band 1/2/5/8 1 WLAN No Bluetooth 2.1, A2DP GPS No Radio FM radio USB microUSB 2.0 Feature OS SC7701B [5] [6] Nokia 3310 4G TA-1077 GSM 900/1800, TD-SCDMA band 34/39, LTE-TDD band 38/41,39,40 1 WLAN Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n Bluetooth 4.0, A2DP, LE GPS Yes Radio FM radio USB microUSB 2.0 YunOS SC9820A [7][8][9] == Related pages == * Nokia 3310 * Nokia * Nokia 5730 XpressMusic == References == Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2017 Category:Nokia mobile phones",
