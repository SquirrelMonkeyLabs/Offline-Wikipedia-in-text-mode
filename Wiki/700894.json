 "text": "Zealandia, also known as Te Riu-a-Māui or Tasmantis, is an almost entirely underwater continent, which sank after separating from Australia 60–85 million years ago and from Antarctica 130–85 million years ago. It was underwater about 23 million years ago, and most of it is sunken (over 93%) under the Pacific Ocean. The continent of Zealandia has an area of 3.5 million km2, is larger than Greenland or India, and almost half the size of Australia. It is very long and narrow, from New Caledonia in the north and south beyond the sub-Antarctic Islands of New Zealand in the south. New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia that is above sea level, followed by New Caledonia. Category:Continents Category:Geography of New Zealand",
