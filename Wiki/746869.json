 "text": "He is Gaia's husband and son, the father of the Hekatonkheires, the elder Cyclops and the first generation Titans. Ouranos has his genitalia cut off from him entirely by his son, Kronos, who was helped by his brothers Iapetos, Hyperion, Kreios, Koios. Before almost dying, Ouranos gave Kronos, a prophecy where Kronos's children would usurp him in a similar manner. Ouranos's ichor (the golden blood of the Greco-Roman gods and goddesses) created a lot of Greco-Roman deities when it touched a certain substance, when the ichor splashed the rocks, it created the Erinyes, who would work for Hades as punishing evil people to death when he would become the god of the Greek underworld. When the ichor splashed the fertile soil, it created the gentler Greco-Roman deities like nymphs and satyrs. He has a grandson among them, through his son Kronos and his partner, the okeanid Philyra, one centaur who is unique and he is Chiron, who is the one who would be someone who would teach the most legendary heroes of all time. When the ichor splashed the ocean foam, it created the love goddess Aphrodite, who was born then off. Ouranos then attached his genitalia to his body entirely off. Ouranos is immortal, he is still alive but since he was almost killed on the earth, which was not his territory, because he is the god of the sky, he couldn't form a consciousness to keep a body. You will wonder how we still have the sky, even if the god is gone from active participation in Greek mythology and Roman mythology, it's because he wasn't completely dead, and because he was exiled in the sky, which we know.",
