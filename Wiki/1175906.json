PSR B1620-26 b is a binary star system of two stars, a white dwarf and a pulsar. It has a confirmed exoplanet which is one of the oldest exoplanets discovered. == System == Viewed as a binary star system, PSR B1620-26 is very far away, being 3,800 parsecs (12,400 ˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞˞light-years) outside the core of Messier 4. It consists if two stars, PSR B1620-26 A is a pulsar and PSR B1620-26 B is a white dwarf (which form a binary star system together) and a exoplanet PSR B1620-26 b which according to astronomers is the oldest planet in the universe. ==White Dwarf== PSR B1620-26 B is 0.34 solar masses and orbits the pulsar every 191 days. == Planetary system == PSR B1620-26 b was discovered in the early 1990s.
