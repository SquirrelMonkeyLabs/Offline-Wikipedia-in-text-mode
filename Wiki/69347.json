 "text": "Weaving is the interlacing of two sets of threads at right angles to each other to form cloth. Weaving is usually done on a loom. One set of threads is called the warp. These threads are held taut and in parallel order on the loom by harnesses creating a space called the shed. The weft thread is wound onto bobbins. In old-fashioned hand weaving the bobbins are held in a shuttle, which carries the weft thread through the shed. The warp threads are moved over and under the weft threads. Modern high speed weaving does not use a shuttle. Category:Hobbies",
