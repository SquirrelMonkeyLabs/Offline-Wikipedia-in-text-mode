 "text": "Nine-ball (sometimes written 9-ball) is a cue sport and a type of pool. The game was first played in the United States in the 1920s. It is played on a rectangular billiard table with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue stick, players must strike the white ball to pocket 9 colored billiard balls in order. An individual game is won by the player pocketing the 9-ball. Matches are usually played as a race to a set number of games, with the player who reaches the set number winning the match. == Popular culture == The sport has featured in popular culture, most notably in the 1956 novel The Hustler and its 1961 film adaptation, and the 1984 novel sequel The Color of Money and 1986 film The Color of Money. == References == ==Other websites== * * Pro9 - website detailing the many nine-ball tournaments held within the British Isles and beyond Category:Cue sports Category:Indoor sports Category:Pool (cue sports)",
