 "text": "Antoine Griezmann (born 21 March 1991) is a French footballer. He plays for Atlético Madrid and the French national team as a forward. He was a part of the French national team selection that won the 2018 FIFA World Cup. == Club career == === Real Sociedad === Griezmann played his first professional match with Real Sociedad on 2 September 2009 in a Copa del Rey match against Rayo Vallecano. He scored his first professional goal in a 2-0 win against Huesca. === Atletico Madrid === On 28 July 2014, Griezmann transferred to Atlético Madrid from Real Sociedad for a fee of 30 million Euros. He scored his first goal for the club in a game against Olympiacos F.C.. They lost 3-2. Griezmann scored twice in the 2018 UEFA Europa League Final against Olympique de Marseille. Atletico won 3-0. Barcelona offered him a contract in June 2018, but he declined the offer and stayed at Atletico for one more year. === Barcelona === On 12 July 2019, Griezmann signed to FC Barcelona after they bought his 120 million euro buy-out clause. The transfer created a lot of controversy because experts claim Barcelona paid 80 million euros less than the actual release clause of 200 million. == Personal life == Griezmann got married to Erika Choperena on 15 June 2017. They have two children: a daughter named Mia, born on 8 April 2016, and a son named Amaro, born on 8 April 2019. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition
