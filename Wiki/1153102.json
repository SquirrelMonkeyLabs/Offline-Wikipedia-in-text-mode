 "text": "Ameerega pongoensis is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== This frog lives in forest that has never been cut down, forest that has been destroyed and is growing back, near streams where the water moves slowly. Scientists saw the frog between 200 and 800 meters above sea level. The frog lives in at least two protected parks: Cordillera Azul National Park and Cordillera Escalera Regional Conservation Area. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in streams where the water moves slowly. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Humans change the places where the frog lives to make farms, especially palm farms. People also catch this frog and sell it outside of Peru, even though this is against the law. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
