 "text": "Bledlow Ridge is a village in the civil parish of Bledlow-cum-Saunderton in Buckinghamshire, England. In 2004, 940 people lived there. It is in the Chiltern Hills, about 4 miles SSW of Princes Risborough and on the road between the High Wycombe and Chinnor. The hamlet was first in the ecclesiastical parish of Bledlow. It became separate in 1868 when the new chapel, dedicated to St Paul, was constructed. As is common with other similar villages in the Chiltern Hills, properties have become increasingly in demand due to its location and the improvement in rail connections and road connections to London. It has a recently refurbished village shop, The Country Store (formerly the \"Kedai\"), and a local school, Bledlow Ridge School. Bledlow Ridge has a number of clubs, such as 'Bridge', a youth club and a cricket club. As well as the corner shop, there is also an Equestrian Centre, park, tennis courts and a cricket pitch the 'Bledlow Ridge Cricket Club' owns. Yoesden, south of Chinnor Road, is a nature reserve the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust manages. ==Notable residents== *Sir Stuart Hampson â€“ Former Chairman of the John Lewis Partnership. *Stewart Copeland - Founder and drummer of The Police. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Villages in Buckinghamshire",
