 "text": "Nucleophilic aromatic substitution is a type of chemical reaction in organic chemistry. As the name suggests, it is a reaction where a nucleophile (a chemical with many electrons, that is attracted to chemicals with fewer electrons) substitutes (replaces a functional group) on an aromatic ring. Aromatic rings are normally nucleophiles, so nucleophilic aromatic substitution only happens in the right conditions. Normally, this is the presence of electron-withdrawing groups in other positions on the ring. Category:Chemical reactions",
