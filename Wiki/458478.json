He is the president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on 24 October 2009. He had served as Archbishop of Cape Coast. He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in 2003. Many people think that Turkson might become the first black pope. After the death of Pope Francis, Turkson has been seen as papabile, meaning a possible candidate for pope in the 2025 papal conclave. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church Category:Ghanaian people Category:Roman Catholic archbishops",
