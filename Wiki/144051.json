He is most notable for the influence he had on the work of his great-grandson, author William Faulkner. Although born in Knox County, Tennessee, Falkner lived with his family in Missouri and Pontotoc, Mississippi before settling at the age of 17 in Ripley, Tippah County, Mississippi. He served in the Mexican- American War and, when the American Civil War broke out, he raised a company of men and was made colonel in the Second Mississippi Infantry of the Confederate Army. == Related pages == *List of poets from North America ==Other websites== *Biography at Mississippi Writers Project, source of most of this article *Information from University of Michigan Category:1825 births Category:1889 deaths Category:American poets Category:Military people from Mississippi Category:Writers from Tennessee Category:Writers from Mississippi Category:Businesspeople from Tennessee Category:Businesspeople from Mississippi Category:People from Pontotoc, Mississippi",
