 "text": "Dotdash Meredith (formerly The Mining Company, About.com, Dotdash) is an American digital media company that publishes articles and videos about various subjects across categories including health, home, food, finance, tech, beauty, travel and education. It operates brands including Verywell, The Spruce, The Balance, Investopedia, Lifewire, TripSavvy and ThoughtCo. The digital media company changed its name to Dotdash in 2017. In 2001, the company was fully integrated into Primedia (now known as Media Central). Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Dotdash has undergone several changes in ownership and branding. In 2005, the New York Times bought About.com for $410 million. However, in 2012, IAC bought the website for $300 million from The New York Times Company. In 2013, the siteâ€™s content was divided into separate topic pages, each of which became a standalone website. The company changed its name to Dotdash in 2017 to reflect this change. As of 2020, Dotdash is one of the largest publishers online, and its brands are among the fastest-growing in their respective categories. On October 6, 2021, Dotdash bought Meredith's magazine and other non-broadcast assets (including the former Time Inc. assets) for $2.7 billion, forming the new entity called Dotdash Meredith. The transaction was made final on December 1. == References == Category:Companies of the United States",
