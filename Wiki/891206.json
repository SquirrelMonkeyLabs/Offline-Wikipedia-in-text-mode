In 2016 the Ethiopian government forced the Standard to stop publishing in print, but it continued to publish online. Two years later, when a new Prime Minister was elected, the Standard started publishing in print again. In 2020 one of the Standard's reporters, Medihane Ekubamichael, was detained for reporting in Tigray amidst a war in northern Ethiopia. He was later freed. Addis Standard was also suspended during the early stages of the Tigray war by the Ethiopian Media Authority. == References == Category:Monthly magazines",
