 "text": "Twerking is a dance style. The dancer (usually a female) shakes and bounces (jiggles) her buttocks in a sexually provocative manner while in a low squatting posture. Oxford Dictionaries defines 'twerking' as a verb: \"dance to popular music in a sexually provocative manner involving thrusting hip movements and a low, squatting stance\". Twerking drew a lot of attention in the United States when Miley Cyrus did a twerking dance on nationwide television during the MTV Video Music Awards program in August 2013. ==References== Category:Dances",
