Founded in 1933, this league represents the highest level of professional football competition within the country. As one of the oldest football leagues in South America, the Primera División has a rich history and plays a crucial role in Chile's football culture. The league is organized by the Chilean Football Federation (FFCh), which oversees its operations and ensures that it adheres to national and international football regulations. Initially, the league began with a modest number of teams, but over the decades, it has grown in size and stature. Today, it consists of 16 teams that compete in a round-robin format. Each team plays a total of 30 matches during the regular season, facing each of the other 15 teams twice—once at home and once away. This format ensures that the competition remains balanced and fair, with each team having an equal opportunity to face every other team in the league. At the end of the regular season, the team with the highest number of points is awarded the league title and crowned the champion of the Primera División. Points are accumulated based on match results, with teams earning three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. In addition to determining the champion, the final standings also influence the league's structure for the following season, particularly through the mechanisms of promotion and relegation. The promotion and relegation system is a key feature of the Primera División. The three lowest-placed teams in the league standings at the end of each season are relegated to the Primera B, the second-tier league in Chile. Conversely, the top teams from the Primera B are promoted to the Primera División. This system ensures that the league remains competitive and dynamic, providing opportunities for teams from the lower tier to ascend and challenge for top honors. In addition to determining domestic champions, the performance of Primera División teams in international competitions is another important aspect of the league. Successful teams often qualify for tournaments such as the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana, which are prestigious competitions for South American clubs. Participation in these tournaments not only brings additional exposure to Chilean football but also provides opportunities for teams to compete against some of the best clubs from across the continent. The Primera División is renowned for its passionate and devoted fan base. Matches are often marked by vibrant atmospheres and intense rivalries. One of the most notable rivalries in Chilean football is the \"Superclásico\" between Colo-Colo and Universidad de Chile. This fixture is highly anticipated and draws significant attention both domestically and internationally. The fervor and enthusiasm of the fans contribute to the electric atmosphere at games and highlight the deep-rooted cultural significance of football in Chile. Historically, some clubs have dominated the league, with Colo-Colo being one of the most successful teams. Founded in 1925, Colo-Colo has won numerous titles and has a storied history in Chilean football. Universidad de Chile and Universidad Catolica are also prominent teams with rich traditions and substantial success in domestic and international competitions. The success of these clubs has helped to elevate the profile of the league and attract attention from football enthusiasts around the world. == References == Category:Football in Chile",
