The song quickly became popular. It was sung by a choir of 10,000 at the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. In 1907, the New South Wales Government awarded McCormick £100 for composing the song. On 30 October 1916, McCormick died at his home, Clydebank, in the Sydney suburb of Waverley.
