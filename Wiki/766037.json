 "text": "The slender tree frog (Litoria adelaidensis) is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in southwestern Australia. These frogs can grow to 4.5 cm long from nose to rear end. They are pale brown to bright green in colour. They have stripes down their sides. Adult frogs live near the coast or inland and stay near bodies of water. They lay their eggs on underwater plants. The tadpoles are light in colour with stripes down their sides and can grow to 5.5 cm long. They have two rows of teeth on their top jaw and three rows of teeth on their lower jaw. Even though this frog's Latin name comes from the city Adelaide, the frogs do not live in Adelaide. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
