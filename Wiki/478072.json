 "text": "Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is a survival horror point and click video game. It was created by Scott Cawthon The game is available on Windows, Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4 and xbox chronologically set to be a sequel to Five Nights at Freddy's 4, and the prequel to Five Nights at Freddy's. The game takes place in September of 1987. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was released on November 11, 2015, on Steam and Desura for $7.99. There is also a free demo on IndieDB, which only has the first two nights available to play. The game was supposed to be released sometime in 2015, as seen on a poster on Scott Cawthon's website, but it was changed due to problems in releasing the demo. It was released on Steam and Desura on November 10, 2014, after a delay with the demo. A mobile port for Android was released on November 13, 2014, and an iOS port on November 20, 2014 In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike! What could go wrong? As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor camera and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office. As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment Like the first game, FNaF 2 is an indie point-and-click survival horror video game. The player controls Jeremy Fitzgerald, the night guard at the newly revamped Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Like in the first entry, Jeremy must survive from midnight to 6 AM without being attacked by the Animatronics wandering through the building. The game introduces the Toy Animatronics as the main antagonists, while the Classic Animatronics from FNaF 1 return as Withered Animatronics - damaged shells of their former selves. This game also introduces two new animatronics, The Puppet and Balloon Boy. As in the first game, Jeremy will be located in the security office for the duration of each night. He will have access to a Monitor that allows him to scroll through the security cameras and a Flashlight with limited battery that can illuminate rooms being viewed on the cameras. Animatronics will slowly navigate the building and attempt to get into the Office, either through the Main Hall or one of two air vents on either side of the desk - all of which can be illuminated using Light switches. Unlike in FNaF 1, however, the Doors and Power mechanics have both been removed, meaning that the player cannot stop animatronics getting inside the Office. Mathew can put on a Freddy Fazbear Head to disguise himself if an animatronic enters the Office and evade being attacked - however, this does not work on Withered Foxy, who must be scared off using the Flashlight instead. To prevent the mask from being abused, however, there is a Music Box in the building's Prize Counter that slowly winds down over time. The player must frequently open the Monitor, flip to the Prize Counter and rewind the music box - if it fully unwinds, the Puppet will escape from its prize box and head towards the Office, and like Withered Foxy, it cannot be fooled by the Freddy head. Failure to defend himself from an animatronic (except Balloon Boy, who will instead disable the Flashlight) will result in them jumpscaring the player and killing Jeremy, resulting in a Game Over. The game's main campaign is split into five levels, or \"nights\", just like the original game. Beating Night 5 will unlock an extra-difficult Night 6, and beating that unlocks a customizable Night 7 which allows you to adjust the difficulty of each animatronic. There are also four hidden minigames that can randomly occur upon receiving a Game Over, which allow you to play as the animatronics in Atari-style levels that give insight on the plot. The promotional poster for the game was first uploaded on Scott's official website on September 12, 2014. Official pictures released by Scott Cawthon suggested that the original animatronics may have gone into disrepair like Foxy and have been replaced by new ones. However, following the release of the first teaser image, two more images surfaced, depicting the current Bonnie and Foxy alongside the newer models of the same characters. Further updates from Scott's website show that a new animatronic would be joining the cast of already confirmed characters - a clown-like puppet appearing in what is now known as the Prize Corner. A two- night demo was released to the general public, while exclusive three-night demos were released to certain YouTubers such as Markiplier. Soon after the demo came out, the full game was released to everyone.
