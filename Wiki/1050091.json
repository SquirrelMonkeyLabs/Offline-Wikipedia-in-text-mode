 "text": "\"Go D.J.\" is the second single off of American rapper Lil Wayne's fourth studio album Tha Carter. The song was released on October 5, 2004. The song samples the chorus from former Cash Money group U.N.L.V.'s 1998 song \"Don't U Be Greedy\". The song was able to make it to #13 on the Hot Rap Songs, #27 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs, #32 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #19 on the Rhythmic. The song was certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In a Complex interview, producer Mannie Fresh said about the song: \"‘Go DJ’ was a song that was done way before. It didn’t sound like that, but it was a phrase that UNLV used to say about me. They said it on one of their earliest songs, saying, ‘Go DJ, that’s my DJ. Mannie Fresh, that’s my DJ. Wayne was like, 'I remember this song when I was growing up. They played it in the clubs. They used to always say ‘Go DJ, that’s my DJ.’ Can I use that?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, it’s basically my song.’ Like I said, Wayne always went back to stuff that people would forget about.\" A music video for the song was released. In the video, Wayne and Manny are in prison. Manny knocks the guard out and raps over the prison's PA system. Prisoners run and try to escape. A prisoner frees Wayne, who is strapped to an electric chair. Wayne raps on top of a cafeteria table. Wayne is then watching a boxing match in the prison yard. Wayne meets a group of men and they re-enter the prison. A prisoner put a sign that read \"That Carter\" over the prison's sign. The video was shot at Mansfield Reformatory, the same prison where the 1994 movie The Shawshank Redemption was shot. The song is featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 video game Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition as well as the 2006 remix of the game. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2004 songs Category:Lil Wayne songs Category:Hip hop songs",
