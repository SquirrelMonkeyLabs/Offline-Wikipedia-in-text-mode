Dr. Kizza Besigye, is a Ugandan physician, politician, and former military officer in the Uganda People's Defence Force. == Early life and education == Kifefe was born and raised in Rwakabengo, Uganda, on 22 April 1956. He went to Kinyasano Primary School and Mbarara Junior School for his Primary school education. He later joined Kampala's Kitante High School for his Ordinary Levels and then Kigezi High School in Kabale District for his Advanced Level education. == Career == In October 2021, Kizza Besigye launched a new movement, called the Popular Front for the Transition, bringing together several political groups. ==Abduction== In November 2024, Winnie Byanyima said that Besigye had been abducted while he was in Nairobi, Kenya on 16 November to attend a book launch for Martha Karua and was being held in a military prison in Kampala. The Kenyan government denied involvement in the incident, but a spokesperson for the Ugandan government said that Kenya had been informed. On 20 November, he appeared along with FDC member Hajj Lutale Kamulegeya before a military court in Kampala, where he was charged with possession of an illegal firearm and “soliciting military support in Geneva, Greece and Nairobi to prejudice security of defense forces”. Besigye and Kamulegeya pleaded not guilty and were remanded to Luzira Maximum Security Prison. On January 31, 2025, Uganda's highest court declared that the trial of civilians in military courts was unconstitutional, ordering an immediate halt to all prosecutions against Besigye. On February 12, 2025, Kizza Besigye began a hunger strike. == References == Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Ugandan politicians",
