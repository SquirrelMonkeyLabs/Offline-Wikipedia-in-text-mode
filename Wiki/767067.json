 "text": "The M42 is a motorway in the Midlands of England. It runs northeast from the M5 near Bromsgrove, Worcestershire to near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. It runs south of the West Midlands conurbation, going through Solihull and Birmingham Airport. Here, it crosses the M6 motorway. It then goes past Coleshill and then past Tamworth, before ending. At the end of the motorway, just south of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, it becomes the A42. The road was first built in the 1970s, and was built to make a motorway between the East and West Midlands. It is now also used as part of a ring road around Birmingham nicknamed the \"Birmingham Box\". It is made up of parts of the M5, M6, and M42 motorways. ==Junctions== {| style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em; color:black;\" class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#0079C1; text-align:center; color:white; font-size:120%;\" | colspan=\"6\" | M42 motorway junctions |- style=\"background:#000; text-align:center; color:white;\" | mile | km | Southbound exits (A carriageway) | Junction | Northbound exits (B carriageway) | Coordinates |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 0.0 0.9 | 0.0 1.4 | The NORTH WEST, Birmingham (W, N & C), Stourbridge, (M6) M5(N) The SOUTH WEST, Worcester M5(S) | M5 J4A | Start of motorway | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |1.4 1.6 |2.3 2.6 | Bromsgrove A38 |J1 | No access (on-slip only) | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |5.6 6.0 |9.0 9.6 | Birmingham (S) A441 Hopwood Park services |J2 Services | Birmingham (S) A441 Hopwood Park services | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |8.4 |13.5 | style=background:skyblue | Entering Worcestershire |rowspan=2|J3 | Birmingham (S), Redditch, Evesham A435 |rowspan=2| |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |8.8 |14.1 | Birmingham (S), Redditch, Evesham A435 | style=background:skyblue | Entering Warwickshire |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |11.7 12.2 |18.8 19.7 | End of variable speed limit |rowspan=2|J3A (TOTSO NB) Termination point M40 | Start of variable speed limit |rowspan=2| |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | | London, Warwick, Stratford M40 | London, Warwick, Stratford M40 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | | style=background:skyblue | Entering Warwickshire | | style=background:skyblue | Entering West Midlands | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |14.2 14.5 |22.8 23.3 | Shirley A34 |J4 | Shirley A34 | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |16.5 16.9 |26.6 27.2 | Solihull A41 |J5 | Solihull A41 | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |19.9 20.3 |32.1 32.7 | Birmingham (E), Birmingham International , Birmingham , N.E.C., Coventry A45 |J6 | Birmingham (E), Birmingham International , Birmingham , N.E.C.
