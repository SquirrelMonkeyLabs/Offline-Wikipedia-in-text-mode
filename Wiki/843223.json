 "text": "The 2017 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election was held on 1 August 2017 to choose the next Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party. The election was won by Deputy Leader and Mount Albert MP Jacinda Ardern. She was the only candidate running. Labour leader Andrew Little had led Labour since 2014 and, after many poor results, announced his plan to retire from the leadership. According to Ardern, Little had previously approached her on 26 July 2017 and stated he thought she should take over as party leader, as he was of the opinion he could not turn things around for Labour. Ardern said she had refused, telling him to \"stick it out\". ==References== Category:2017 elections in New Zealand Category:August 2017 events Category:Jacinda Ardern",
