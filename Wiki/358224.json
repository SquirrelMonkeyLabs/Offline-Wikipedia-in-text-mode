He was the Republican Party nominee for Vice President in the 2012 election. On October 22, 2015, Ryan said he was going to run for Speaker of the United States to succeed John Boehner. He was elected on October 29 and shortly afterwards became speaker. As Speaker, Ryan helped launch the House passing of the American Health Care Act. Ryan announced his retirement from Congress on April 11, 2018. ==Early life== Ryan was born at Mercyhealth Hospital and Trauma Center in Janesville, Wisconsin. His parents were Elizabeth A. \"Judy\" (n√©e Hutter) and Paul Murray Ryan. Ryan studied at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. His father died of a heart attack when Ryan was in his teenage years. His grandmother moved in shortly afterwards because she had Alzheimer's disease. ==United States representative (1999-2019)== Ryan was first elected to the House in 1999, winning the 1st District seat of Mark Neumann, a two- term incumbent who had vacated his seat to make an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate. Ryan won the Republican primary over 29-year-old pianist Michael J. Logan of Twin Lakes. Ryan became the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee in 2008, then chairman in 2012 after Republicans took control of the House. That same year he was selected to deliver the Republican response to the State of the Union address. During his 12 years in the House, Ryan has sponsored more than 70 bills or amendments, of which two were enacted into law. One, passed in July 2000, renamed a post office in Ryan's district; the other, passed in December 2009, lowered the excise tax on arrow shafts. Ryan has also co-sponsored 975 bills, of which 176 have passed. 22 percent of these bills were originally sponsored by Democrats. In 2010, Ryan was a member of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (Bowles-Simpson Commission), which was tasked with developing a plan to reduce the federal deficit. He voted against the final report of the commission. In 2012, Ryan accused the nation's top military leaders of using \"smoke and mirrors\" to remain under budget limits passed by Congress. Ryan later said that he misspoke on the issue and called General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to apologize for his comments. As of mid-2012, Ryan had been on seven trips abroad as part of a congressional delegation. ==Speaker of the House (2015-2019)== On October 9, 2015, after the resignation of Speaker of the House John Boehner, Ryan confirmed that he might run for speaker.
