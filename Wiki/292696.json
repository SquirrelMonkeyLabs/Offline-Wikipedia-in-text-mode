 "text": "Over the Limit was a professional wrestling event that was held yearly by WWE, and aired live only on pay-per-view (PPV). The first one was held in 2010, taking the place of Judgment Day in the May slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. The last event took place on May 20, 2012 at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was replaced by WWE Battleground in 2013. As is the case with most lower level PPV's made by WWE, the event was held only in arenas in the United States. Championship bouts were scheduled on every card, with the lower level title matches on the undercard and the top level featured on the main card. Under the Brand Extension, WWE assigned its performers to either Raw or SmackDown which caused matches to be set up between wrestlers on the same show. However, the brand extension ended in August 2011, and therefore the 2012 event was held without it. ==Dates and venues== Event Date City Arena Main event Over the Limit (2010) May 23, 2010 Detroit, Michigan Joe Louis Arena John Cena (c) vs. Batista in a \"I Quit\" match for the WWE Championship Over the Limit (2011) May 22, 2011 Seattle, Washington KeyArena John Cena (c) vs. The Miz in an \"I Quit\" match for the WWE Championship Over the Limit (2012) May 20, 2012 Raleigh, North Carolina PNC Arena John Laurinaitis vs. John Cena in a No Disqualification match ==Related pages== *List of WWE pay-per-view events ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Over the Limit website Category:WWE Over the Limit",
