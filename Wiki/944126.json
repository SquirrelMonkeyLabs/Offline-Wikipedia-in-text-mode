 "text": "A square-free integer is a number which is not divisible by any square numbers other than 1. In other words, each prime number that appears in its prime factorization appears exactly once. For example, 6 = 2\\times3 is square-free. However, 27 = 3^3 is not square-free: it is divisible by 9 = 3^2, and the power of 3 in the prime factorization is to a power larger than one. == Möbius function == The Möbius function is a function which takes in natural numbers and is usually written as \\mu(n). The value of \\mu(n) depends on whether or not n is square-free. Specifically, :\\mu(n) = \\begin{cases} 1, &\\text{if }n\\text{ is square-free and has an even number of prime factors}, \\\\\\ -1, &\\text{if }n\\text{ is square-free and has an odd number of prime factors} \\\\\\ 0, &\\text{if }n\\text{ is not square-free} \\end{cases} For example, 6 = 2\\times 3 is square-free with an 2 prime factors, so \\mu(6) = 1. Since 27 = 3^3 is not square-free, then \\mu(27) = 0. Since 5 is prime, it is its own prime decomposition. That is, the prime factorization of 5 has 1 prime factor, so \\mu(5) = -1. == References == Category:Number theory",
