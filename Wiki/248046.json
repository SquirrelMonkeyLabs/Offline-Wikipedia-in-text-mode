 "text": "Bellatrix Lestrange (née Bellatrix Black) is a fictional character of the Harry Potter series and is the sister of Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy's aunt. Her parents are Cygnus Black III and Druella Black (née Rosier) and the eldest of three sisters: Bellatrix, Andromeda and Narcissa. She is an enthusiastic Death Eater who believes that Lord Voldemort is the supreme and everyone should follow him. She marries Rodolphus Lestrange, but it was Voldemort that she truly loved. In the Harry Potter movies she was played by Helena Bonham Carter. She has been to Azkaban, the wizard prison, but Lord Voldemort helped her and the other Death Eaters in Azkaban escape. She murdered many well-loved characters, such as Dobby, (a house-elf), Sirius Black, and Nymphadora Tonks, but she is ultimately killed by Molly Weasley at the end of book 7 when she attempts to kill Ginny Weasley with the killing curse Avada Kedavra. But her infamous legacy lived on through her illegitimate daughter, Delphini, who was born due to Bellatrix's relationship with Lord Voldemort. Her name literally means \"female warrior\" in Latin, which is a nod to her aggressive behavior. Her surname Lestrange is a French variant of \"strange\", a perfect description of her strange personality and her maiden name Black is also a telltale about her dark life, as the color itself doesn't absorb light at all.
