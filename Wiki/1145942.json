 "text": "A flying inflatable boat is a light craft consisting of an inflatable boat with a self-propelled delta wing. These boats, also called zodiacs, use inflatable rubber tubes for buoyancy and are very popular for their ease of transport and storage, as well as their versatility in different bodies of water. == Characteristics == === Inflatable boat === * Construction Materials: Inflatable boats are made of durable materials such as PVC or Hypalon, which provide durability and resistance to marine conditions. * Portability: They can be deflated and stored in compact bags, making them easy to transport and store. * Common Uses: They are used in a variety of applications, from emergency rescues to recreational activities such as fishing and diving. === Motorized Hang Glider === The most recent innovation in inflatable boat design is the incorporation of a delta wing, allowing the boat to fly. This flying craft is capable of combining aquatic navigation with flight, significantly expanding its capabilities and applications. == Structure and Functioning == # Delta Wing: A delta-shaped wing is attached to the craft, providing aerodynamic lift. The wing is light yet strong, designed to withstand the stresses of flight. # Propulsion: Equipped with a propeller motor that not only propels the boat through the water, but also provides the power needed for takeoff and flight. # Control System: The pilot controls the direction and altitude through a system of cables and pulleys connected to the delta wing and the propeller engine. == Applications == * Rescue and Emergency: Perfect for search and rescue missions in areas inaccessible by land. * Exploration and Science: Ideal for scientific explorations in remote and unexplored regions. * Sports and Recreation: Offers an exciting experience for water and air sports enthusiasts. == Safety and Regulations == Like any air or water vehicle, these vessels require proper training for safe operation. In addition, they must comply with national and international regulations for navigation and aviation. == Detected cases in the Canary Islands == Recently, the Civil Guard in the Canary Islands has detected several cases of inflatable boats with flight capacity that are not approved in Spain. These vessels, although innovative, present significant risks if not used correctly and do not comply with established safety regulations. == References == == Literature == * * Manual Internacional de los Servicios Marítimos de Búsqueda y Salvamiento (en castellà). vol. 2: Coordinación de las Misiones.
