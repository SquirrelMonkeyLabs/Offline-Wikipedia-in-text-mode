 "text": "Sonic Mania is the sixth 2D video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It was released in 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It was released as part of the 25th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). It has pixel graphics like the Sega Genesis games, but it is more vibrant and is wide screen. The game was not made by Sonic Team. Instead, it was made by a team of fans and was commissioned by Sega, who published the game. An expanded version called Sonic Mania Plus was released a year after in 2018. It includes a harder mode called \"Encore Mode\" and two new characters from the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog: Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel. ==Plot== Sonic and Tails return to Angel Island. They discover a team of Egg Robos digging up a reality-altering gem called the Phantom Ruby. The ruby teleports them all to Green Hill Zone in the past and transforms the Egg Robos into the Hard-Boiled Heavies. Sonic and Tails chase the Hard-Boiled Heavies until they find out they work for Dr. Robotnik. When beating Stardust Speedway Zone Act 1, Sonic and Tails are transported back to the present day. They find out that Robotnik is using the Phantom Ruby to build a new ultimate weapon. They get into Titanic Monarch Zone and defeat Robotnik. If the player has all of the Chaos Emeralds from the special stages, a true final boss starts where Super Sonic, Robotnik, and Heavy King (leader of the Hard-Boiled Heavies) fight over the Phantom Ruby. == Gameplay == ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * *Sonic Mania at MobyGames Category:2017 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Sega video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about time travel Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
