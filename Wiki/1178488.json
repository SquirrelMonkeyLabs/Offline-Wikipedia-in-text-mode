It is the main town of the Tokaj Wine Region, not just for its wine making and sales, but also for its important position as a transport center. == Location == It is located around 54 kilometers east of Miskolc, in the Tokaj Wine Region, where the Tisza and Bodrog rivers meet, at the base of Kopasz Hill. === Connetion === The main road is Road 38, which you can reach from Szerencs and Nyíregyháza. It connects to Bodrogkeresztúr via road 3838, to Taktabáj via road 3619, and to other nearby small villages via road 3621. The Mezőzombor-Nyíregyháza railway line is affected, with one stop here. == History == The area was first noted in writing in 1067, when it was already a wine area. The town was first called Tokaj in 1353. By the 14th century, there was a castle there. Because of the money from wine, Tokaj grew into a farming town and its population rose. In 1705, Ferenc Rákóczi II ordered the castle to be destroyed to keep it from being taken by others. In the peacful years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Tokaj grew and improved, but this was stopped by the two world wars. In 1944, the German army first, followed by the Soviet army, took control of Tokaj. After World War II, Tokaj grew slowly, and Sátoraljaújhely took over its main place in the wine trade. After the fall of communism in Hungary, Tokaj started to grow quickly again. Tokaj is a well- liked spot for tourists. == Population == In 2022, 93.1% of people said they were Hungarian, 0.5% German, 0.2% Ukrainian, 0.2% Greek, 0.2% Gypsy, 0.1% Croatian, 0.1% Romanian, 0.1% Rusyn, and 0.1% Slovak, while 3.2% identified as other non-Hungarians (6.7% did not respond; due to mixed identities, the total may be above 100%).
