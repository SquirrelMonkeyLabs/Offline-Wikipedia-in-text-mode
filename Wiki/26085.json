CLAMP has created many other series, but Cardcaptor Sakura is one of the most popular. The manga was first published in Nakayoshi from 1996 to 2000. The story is about Sakura Kinomoto, an elementary school student who accidentally frees a deck of magical cards from a book hidden in her father's study. The book's guard, Keroberos, gives Sakura the task to find and capture the troublemaking cards. The series focuses on themes of love and family, Sakura and her friends, and their different relationships. The anime aired on Japanese television from 1998 to 2000, changing parts of the manga's story and introducing new characters, and has two films as well. The English version of the anime was licensed by Nelvana, renamed Cardcaptors, and the story was changed a lot to suit an American audience. ==Story== Ten-year old Sakura Kinomoto is an athletic girl in elementary school. She lives with her father Fujitaka, an archaeology professor, and her older brother Toya. One day she finds a strange book, named the Clow Book, in her father's study. She finds the Clow Cards inside. She learns the cards are magical, accidentally setting them free when she calls the name of the Windy Card. The book's guardian, Kero, gives Sakura the task of finding and capturing the cards, using the Clow Wand to seal them in their card forms. In between all this, Sakura tries to live the life of a normal school girl. Few people know about Sakura's secret life. One of the few is her best friend and second cousin Tomoyo Daidouji. She admires Sakura and supports her in her adventures, while designing Sakura battle costumes and recording her adventures on a video camera. The other is Toya, who also has magical powers. His powers, however, are different to those of Sakura's. For instance, he has the power to communicate with spirits, such as that of their late mother Nadeshiko. Sakura meets Syaoran Li, a boy of her age and a distant relative of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. Syaoran wants to capture the cards himself, becoming Sakura's rival, though they later become friends. Syaoran gains a crush on Sakura and starts to develop feelings for her. It later occurs to him that he is in love with Sakura. Tomoyo, who becomes friends with Syaoran, notices this. Syaoran is worried about telling Sakura that he loves her, concerned that his feelings may burden her due to the double life she leads. Tomoyo nevertheless encourages him to do so. He does attempt to tell Sakura on numerous occasions how he feels about her, but unexpected developments prevent this from happening. Sakura and Syaoran capture all of the cards between them but have to face the second guardian of the Clow Cards, Yue, to decide who will become the new master of the cards. Yue is revealed to be the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, the friend of Sakura's older brother Toya. After a lengthy battle Sakura defeats Yue and becomes the new owner of the Clow Cards. Eriol Hiiragizawa, a student from England, arrives in Sakura's town and begins causing magical troubles around town. He has 3 allies. One is Ruby Moon; a magical being like Yue, who leads a double life as a student at Toya's school called Nakura. She comes to know Toya and Yukito, who is friends with Toya. She enjoys flirting with Toya, much to his annoyance. This is partly due to the fact that he loves Yukito, who loves Toya in return. Another is Spinel Sun, a magical beast like Kero. The other is Kaho Mizuki, a teacher at Sakura's school who has magical powers. Sakura learns that Eriol caused these troubles in order to prompt her to transform the cards into Sakura Cards to continue using their magic or they would become normal cards. Eriol is revealed to be a reincarnation of Clow Reed. Although a different person to Clow Reed, he is the heir to Reed's memories. After tasking Sakura with one last challenge, involving a duel between them, all of the cards are successfully transformed. Eriol returns to England with Kaho, Nakura and Spinel. Syaoran confesses to Sakura that he loves her, who later admits to herself and to Syaoran that she loves him in return. Syaoran reluctantly returns home to Hong Kong but returns to Japan for good two years later to be with Sakura. In the ending of the manga version, Sakura is starting Middle School, and on the way finds to her joy Syaoran waiting for her. Syaoran tells Sakura that he finally finished what he had to do in Hong Kong and can now stay in Tomoeda for good. The two happily embrace, with a tearful Sakura proclaiming that from now on, they will be together forever.Cardcaptor Sakura Collector's Edition Volume 9, Kodansha Comics, English edition 2021, P.286-291 ==Characters== The characters' Japanese names are followed by their English names. * Sakura Kinomoto (木之本櫻) / Sakura Avalon * Toya Kinomoto (木之本桃矢) / Tori Avalon * Fujitaka Kinomoto (木之本藤隆) / Aiden Avalon * Nadeshiko Kinomoto (木之本撫子) / Natasha Avalon * Syaoran Li (李小狼) / Li Showron * Meiling Li (李每鈴) / Meilin Rae * Tomoyo Daidouji (大道寺知世) / Madison Taylor * Sonomi Daidouji (大道寺園美) / Samantha Taylor * Eriol Hiiragizawa (桐澤エリオル) / Eli Moon * Kaho Mizuki (觀月歌帆) / Layla Mackenzie * Yukito Tsukishiro (月城雪兎) / Julian Star * Clow Reed / Clow Reed * Keroberos (ケロベロス) / Cerberus * Yue (ユエ) / Yue * Spinel Sun (スピネル-サン) / Spinner Sun * Ruby Moon (Nakuru Akizuki/秋月奈久留) / Ruby Moon * Chiharu Mihara (三原千春) / Chelsea * Rika Sasaki (佐佐木 利佳) / Rita * Takashi Yamazaki (山崎貴史) / Zachary * Naoko Yanagisawa (柳澤奈緖子) / Nikki * Maki Matsumoto (松本 真樹) / Maggie * Yoshiyuki Terada (寺田良幸) / Mr. Terada ==Media== Cardcaptor Sakura is shown in many countries around the world.

These events dealt mainly with Sakura and Syaoran coming to terms with their love for each other. While going to class one morning, Sakura is surprised to find that she has arrived before Syaoran. When he comes in, he says that he got a call from his mother. Sakura asks him what its about, but before he can say anything their teacher Mr. Terada announces that Eriol will be returning to England. This shocks Sakura, Syaoran, and the others in class. While heading home, she finds Syaoran waiting for her. They go the local park, where Syaoran finally tells her the truth about his feelings for her. He tells Sakura that he loves her and that she is the one he loves the most. Sakura is stunned at his revelation. Syaoran looks sad, saying that is all he wished to say. He also tells Sakura to be careful on her way home. Back at her house, Sakura lies in her bed, struggling to understand the feeling within her that she has for Syaoran. She realises that what she feels for him is different to that of a friend. Toya is aware of what’s going on, having long suspected that Sakura and Syaoran would get romantically involved. Sakura confides in Tomoyo, who is happy that Syaoran finally told Sakura how he feels, but Sakura is still unsure about her own feelings for him. Sakura tells Tomoyo that her chest feels tight when she thinks of Syaoran, and gets tighter when she wonders what he is thinking of her. Tomoyo assures Sakura that the answer is in her. Sakura and Syaoran pay one final visit to Eriol, Kaho, Spinel Sun and Nakura before their departure, while Kaho gives Sakura presents for her and Syaoran. When Sakura goes to Syaoran’s apartment building to give him Kaho’s gift to him, he reveals to her anguish that he is returning to Hong Kong. He tells Sakura that there is something he has to do there. Sakura runs away upset. She finally realizes what Syaoran means to her. She makes a teddy bear to give to Syaoran to express her love for him. Yukito sees this, and asks Sakura if she found the one she loved the most. Sakura happily says she did. Yukito asks Sakura if he can reintroduce them to him someday (not asking Sakura who the person is), but she isn’t sure when Syaoran will be back. Yukito assures Sakura that if she and Syaoran feel the same way, and want to see each other again, then they will. The next morning, Sakura learns from Tomoyo that Syaoran is taking a morning flight, but with Toya's help, reaches Syaoran in time to give it to him. Sakura reveals to Syaoran (who was unsure if Sakura felt the same way about him) that she also loves him, telling Syaoran that he is her “Number One” (the person that she loves the most). Knowing for sure now that Sakura loves him the same way, Syaoran smiles and thanks her for the bear. They both agree to name their respective bears after the other. As the bus begins to leave, Syaoran promises to return to Tomoeda when he is finished with his business in Hong Kong. Syaoran desperately asks Sakura, shouting, if she will wait for him. Sakura promises that she will. Syaoran smiles lovingly back at her, happy to know this. Sakura vows that she wait for as long as she has to, thinking about how Syaoran is the person she loves the most. A few years later, Sakura is starting Middle School. On the way she walks pass the falling cherry blossoms. She regrets that Syaoran isn’t there to watch them with her. She suddenly sees Syaoran waiting for her, holding the bear she gave him so long ago, and happily runs into his arms. The two embrace; reunited and truly together at long last. The name of the special refers to a made up Japanese tradition in the series. If two people love each other, one way they can express it is by giving each other teddy bears. Also, if they name the bears after each other, it means they will be together forever. == References == Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Madhouse (company)",
