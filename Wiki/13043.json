 "text": "Death was one of the first ever death metal bands in the United States. They started in 1983 under the name Mantas and they changed the name to Death in 1984. Death is no longer a band because their guitarist Chuck Schuldiner died on December 13, 2001. He was 34 years old. He had brain cancer and the drugs he used to beat the cancer made him weak. He died of pneumonia. He had another band project called Control Denied during the 3 years before he died. ==Discography== *Scream Bloody Gore (1987) *Leprosy (1988) *Spiritual Healing (1990) *Human (1991) *Individual Thought Patterns (1993) *Symbolic (1995) *The Sound of Perseverance (1998) ==References== Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:American heavy metal bands Category:Death metal bands Category:Musical groups from Orlando, Florida Category:Musical groups established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Florida Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2001 Category:2001 disestablishments in the United States Category:2000s disestablishments in Florida",
