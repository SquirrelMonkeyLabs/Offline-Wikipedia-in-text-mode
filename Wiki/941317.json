Studios at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. This attraction was also announced to open at the Mickey's Toontown section of Disneyland at the Disneyland Resort for a planned 2023 opening date in Anaheim, California. The attraction is the third Mickey Mouse-themed attraction at any Disney property worldwide, only behind The Mickey Mouse Revue and Mickey's Philharmagic, directly based on the series and involves guests watching the premiere of a new Mickey Mouse cartoon and then entering the cartoon itself. The show's creative team, including Paul Rudish, Joseph Holt and composer Christopher Willis, collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering to create the attraction, which opened on March 4, 2020, at Disney's Hollywood Studios. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * Review of \"Croissant de Triomphe\" at FLIP animation magazine Retrieved March 2013 Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:Annie Award winners Category:English-language television programs",
