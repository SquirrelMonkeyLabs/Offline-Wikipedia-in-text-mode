 "text": "Pierre Sanfourche-Laporte (born in Sarlat-la-Canéda on March 24, 1774, where he died on July 9, 1856) was a French jurist. == Biography == His main work, Le Nouveau Valin (1809), refers to René Josué Valin and his commentary on the Marine Ordinance of 1681. The work sees the contribution of Pierre B. Boucher, professor of maritime law, and proposes a commercial code exclusively relating to maritime trade. However, the thesis of the unity of codification prevailed and on January 1, 1808 a general commercial code was published. From 1832 to 1852, he was a lawyer at the Brussels Court of Cassation.https://www.idref.fr/095664661 == References == Category:1774 births Category:1856 deaths Category:French lawyers Category:People from Dordogne",
