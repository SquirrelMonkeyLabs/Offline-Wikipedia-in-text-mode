 "text": "Mayhem is the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter and record producer Lady Gaga. It was released on March 7, 2025, by Streamline and Interscope Records. This marks the longest gap between album releases in Gaga’s entire career, and precedes Chromatica (2020), which was released over four years earlier. Leading up to its release, the album was temporarily referred to as LG7. Gaga collaborated with producers Watt, Cirkut, and Gesaffelstein, while also enlisting her fiancé, Michael Polansky, as a co- writer on several tracks. The ballad \"Die with a Smile\" with Bruno Mars was initially planned as a standalone single but was later included on the album. It became Gaga's sixth US number-one hit and won the Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 67th Grammy Awards, her 14th career Grammy win. The electropop single \"Disease\" reached the top ten in the UK and top thirty in the US and Canada. The second single, the dance-pop \"Abracadabra\", was released on a commercial break during Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025. It reached the top five in the UK and Germany and the top twenty in the US, Australia, and Canada. The first few seconds of \"Shadow of a Man\" were used as the outro for the 2024 HBO Max concert documentary, Gaga: Chromatica Ball. \"Garden of Eden\" was used as the theme for the 2025 Formula 1 season by ESPN. The album has a score of 83/100 on Metacritic, meaning \"universal acclaim.\" Many reviewers pointed out the influences of Gaga's early albums on Mayhem. == Track listing == Track lengths taken from Target exclusive CD metadata.
