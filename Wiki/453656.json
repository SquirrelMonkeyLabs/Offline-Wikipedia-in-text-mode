The winner meets Calypso, a mysterious man who grants them a wish. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 7 out of 10 and said \"\"The game's only downfall is that it's just too short. The game can be completed in just a couple of hours. However, the two-player split-screen combat mode more than makes up for the one-player mode's lack of length.\"\" The game was successful and sold over 1.08 million copies in the United States alone. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1995 video games Category:Twisted Metal Category:Christmas video games Category:PlayStation games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Vehicular combat games",
