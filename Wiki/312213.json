 "text": "An electrical outlet or receptacle, frequently called a wall outlet, is a socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply. In buildings, electrical outlets are usually installed in the wall, although they can also be installed in the floor. Occasionally, they are found in the ceiling for powering devices such as garage door openers or neon signs in storefront windows. Different countries often have different outlet types and voltages. Adapters are available to convert between the different types. == Other websites == * International power cords technology * Glossary of standards terms * Electricity Around The World (about plugs, sockets and electrical systems used around the world) * Change to UK electrical wire colors 2004 * Household electrical safety handbook, Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government * IEEE history of Australian power connectors (in pdf format) * South Africa Eskom: Wiring a Plug * Guidance Notes for the Electrical Products (Safety) Regulation (Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, Hong Kong) * Museum of Plugs and Sockets: pictures including disassembled units Category:Electrical wiring",
