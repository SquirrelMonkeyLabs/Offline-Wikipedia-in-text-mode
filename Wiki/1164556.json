 "text": "Allobates amissibilis is a frog. It lives in Guyana. ==Body== The adult frog is 16.3 to 17.8 mm long from nose to rear end. There is a wide stripe on each side of the body from the middle of the body to where the hind legs meet the body. The adult male frog has a pink-gray throat with dark marks and the adult female frog has a cream or yellow throat. ==Home== This frog lives in forests in low places and on hills. Scientists saw the frog between 160 and 950 meters above sea level. This frog lives in the Iwokrama Mountains, which are inside a protected preserve. ==Young== Other frogs in Allobates lay their eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. No scientists have reported A. amissibilis tadpoles, so they do not know if this is how these frogs reproduce. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. People also bring visitors to the places where the frog lives. Scientists say this could become a problem if people change the place where the frog lives too much or bring diseases from other parts of the planet. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
