 "text": "The cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus) is also known as the 'black vulture', 'monk vulture', or 'Eurasian black vulture'. It is a member of the family Accipitridae. It is one of the two largest old world vultures. This bird is an Old World vulture, and is only distantly related to the New World vultures, which are in a separate family, Cathartidae, of the same order. It is therefore not directly related to the much smaller American black vulture despite the similar name and coloration. ==References== Category:Accipitriformes Category:Birds of Asia Category:Birds of Europe Category:Vultures",
