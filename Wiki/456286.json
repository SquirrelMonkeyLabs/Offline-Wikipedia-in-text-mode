 "text": "Opisthokonts are a superkingdom of the Eukaryota, including the animals and fungi. It is a group of unikonts. There are several classifications of the eukaryotes which are being discussed. Each of them divides the domain Eukaryota into five groups, but there is disagreement on the details.Adl S.M. et al 2005. The new higher level classification of eukaryotes with emphasis on the taxonomy of protists. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 52 (5): 399–451. PMID 16248873 The Opisthokonta is thought to be a monophyletic clade, and therefore superior to the Unikonta as a taxonomic term.Huang, Jinling, Ying Xu, and Johann Peter Gogarten. The presence of a haloarchaeal type tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase marks the opisthokonts as monophyletic.
