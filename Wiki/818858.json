 "text": "The Grand Union Canal was a canal in England from Foxton, Leicestershire on the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal to Norton Junction, close to Long Buckby Wharf on the Grand Junction Canal. It now forms the first of the Leicester Section, a branch of the much bigger modern Grand Union Canal. The creation of the canal system in central England was hugely important to the industrial revolution. It allowed the raw materials and the products to be moved cheaply. Many factories back onto rivers or canals all over industrial England. Moving heavy loads is cheapest and best done on water. == References == Category:Canals in England",
