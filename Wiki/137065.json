 "text": "The Reconquista (Spanish and Portuguese word for \"Reconquest\"; Arabic: الاسترداد, \"Recapturing\") was a period of 800 years in the Middle Ages during which the several Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula grew by conquering Al-Andalus (Arabic الأندلس), the Muslim states on the peninsula. The Reconquista began shortly after the Islamic conquest of the peninsula. Much of the ideology of the Reconquista was common to most Crusades, and soldiers from all Christendom travelled to Iberia to fight the Muslims as an act of Christian repentance. The Reconquista came to an end on 2 January 1492, with the capture of Granada. The last Muslim ruler of Granada surrendered his kingdom to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, the Catholic Monarchs (Spanish: los Reyes Católicos). That event marked the end of Muslim rule on the peninsula. == Bibliography == * Watt, W. Montgomery: A History of Islamic Spain. University Press of Edinburgh (1992). * Watt, W.
