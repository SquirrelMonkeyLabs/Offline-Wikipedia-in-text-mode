 "text": "Bathylychnops exilis, also known as the Javelin spookfish, is a species of barreleye found in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. It lives at a depth of 640 meters (2,100 ft). It is 50 cm long. == Description == The Javelin spookfish's body is transparent and elongated, almost like a pike. The number of vertebrae is 78 to 84. Its muscles are well developed, meaning it's an active swimmer compared to other deep-sea fish. The species has unusual protuberances that grow from its eyes, which made people call it a four-eyed fish. Despite this, however, they are not related to the genus Anableps at all. == Related pages == * List of fish common names == References == # Cohen DM (1958). \"Bathylychnops exilis, a new genus and species of argentinoid fish from the North Pacific\".
