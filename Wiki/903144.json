 "text": "The esperanza tree frog (Charadrahyla esperancensis) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it in Oaxaca at 1640 meters above sea level. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 44.3 to 48.9 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog has smooth skin on its back and legs. It has bumpy skin on its belly. The top of the head and top of the back are either light brown or green-brown in color. The sides of the head has dark brown color from the nose to the eardrum. The sides of the frog's body are dark brown with yellow spots. The spots are not perfectly round. The tops of the legs are light brown with darker brown stripes going across. The legs have yellow spots. This frog has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks are darker in color than the rest of the toe. The belly is light in color. ==Name== \"Esperanza\" is \"hope\" in Spanish. Scientists named after the place where they saw the frog: La Esperanza in Sierra Juarez. ==Threats== This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees to have wood or make towns and cities. This cuts the place where the frog lives into small pieces, where frogs in different places cannot go to each other. This makes them make young only with other frogs nearby, and they may be too closely realted to each other. These frogs also die from disease and climate change. Human beings who live near La Esperanza have saved 4000 hectares of land to save this frog and other animals that live there. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
