 "text": "HD 189733, also known as V452 Vulpeculae, is a binary star system 64.5 light years away in the constellation of Vulpecula. The main star is believed to be an orange dwarf, while the second star is a red dwarf star. Since this system has the same visual magnitude as star HD 209458, it promises a lot for the study of extrasolar planets when they pass in front of their stars. The star can be seen with binoculars 0.3 degrees east of the Dumbbell Nebula (M27). As of 2005, it has been confirmed that an exoplanet, HD 189733 b, orbits the main star within the system. == References == Category:Binary stars",
