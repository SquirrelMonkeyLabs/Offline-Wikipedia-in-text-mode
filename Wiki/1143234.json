 "text": "Rembrandt (15 March 1977 â€“ 30 October 2001) was a horse ridden for Germany by Nicole Uphoff in dressage competitions. Rembrandt and Uphoff won four Olympic gold medals. Uphoff and Rembrandt also won three gold and one silver World Equestrian Games medals. == Early life == Rembrandt was born on March 15, 1977. Because of his looks, many riders did not want to buy him. In 1981, he was bought by Nicole Uphoff's father. Rembrandt was too much for Nicole. He was sent to train with a trainer. The trainer saw his greatness and told the Uphoffs to keep the horse. == Competitive career == In 1985, Rembrandt and Nicole Uphoff began to compete at events for young riders. In 1986, the pair began working with a dressage coach. In 1987, Rembrandt and Uphoff were at the top of the dressage world with speed. Rembrandt and Uphoff were chosen to be in the 1988 Olympics because of their fame. Uphoff changed trainers four months before the Games began. Rembrandt and Uphoff were Olympic Champions twice. They won in 1988 in Seoul and 1992 in Barcelona. In the Olympics, Rembrandt and Uphoff both took gold and a gold medal with the German team. The Barcelona games resulted in Rembrandt being titled a \"living work of art\" by one German sports commentator. During the last two years of his career, Rembrandt began to decline slightly, and he missed the team nomination to the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1993, he was injured by a kick from another horse during a lap at the German Championships. The German team, with Uphoff, again took gold. In 1991, Uphoff and Rembrandt were second place at the championships in Donaueschingen, Germany. At the 1995 Championships in Mondorf, Luxembourg, Rembrandt helped the German team to win a gold medal. == Death == In 1996, Rembrandt and Uphoff gave a goodbye show for Rembrandt's retirement. He spent the rest of his life at Uphoff's farm. On October 30, 2001, he was euthanized after his health went down. Rembrandt was also known because he was fearful. He is known as a \"legendary\" horse. In 2009, Uphoff gave away Rembrandt's saddle to CHIO Aachen in Germany. CHIO Aachen is a museum. == References == Category:1977 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Dressage horses Category:Olympic gold medalists for Germany Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics",
