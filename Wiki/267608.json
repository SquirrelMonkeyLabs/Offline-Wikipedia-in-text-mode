 "text": "Hydrogen telluride, also known as hydrotelluric acid, tellane, or tellurium hydride, is a chemical compound. It is also an acid. Its chemical formula is H2Te. It contains hydrogen and telluride ions. ==Properties== Hydrogen telluride is a toxic reactive gas. It easily decomposes to hydrogen and tellurium. It also burns in air to make tellurium dioxide and water. It has a very bad smell of decayed garlic. It is almost as acidic as phosphoric acid. It reacts with some metals and metal oxides to make tellurides. ==Preparation== It is made by adding a strong acid to a telluride, such as sodium telluride. ==Uses== Hydrogen telluride does not have many uses because it is very toxic and unstable. ==Related pages== *Aluminium telluride *Sodium tellurite ==Sources== Category:Tellurium compounds Category:Binary acids",
