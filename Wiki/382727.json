It is also one of the 88 modern constellations that were made by the International Astronomical Union. The star Sirius is in Canis Major. Sirius has a magnitude of -1.44, which means that it is the brightest star in the night sky. It is sometimes called the \"dog star.\" Also, Sirius is only 8.6 light years away from Earth, which is very close (compared to other stars).
