 "text": "Litoria eurynastes is a frog from Papua New Guinea. It is like Litoria bicolor but it is larger. Adult male frogs are 25.7 to 31.5 mm long from nose to rear end. Adult female frogs are 27.3 to 33.0 mm. Some adult frogs have teeth in their upper jaws. These are called vomerine teeth. They have some webbing on their front feet and more webbing on their hind feet. There are five groups of Litoria eurynastes living in the wild and they are not all the same color. They can be bright green, yellow-green, or brownish-green. Some of them have gold or light green stripes down their bodies. There is a disc on each finger. The Greek name eurynastes means wide-dwelling, meaning living in many places. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
