 "text": "The tepui tree frog (Boana tepuiana) is a frog that lives in Brazil and Venezuela. Scientists have seen it between 420 and 1800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 30.0-36.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 34.5-47.7 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is smooth, with no warts or bumps. There are some bumps on the belly. The skin on the back is bright yellow with some brown marks, brown with gray marks, or dark brown with yellow stripes. The toes and webbing between the toes are red- orange in color. The frog's tongue is wide and round, and it has vomerine teeth in its jaw. This frog's scientific name, tepuiana, is for the Tepui Mountains in Venezuela. That is where the frog lives. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
