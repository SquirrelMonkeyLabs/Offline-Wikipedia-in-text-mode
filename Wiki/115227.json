 "text": "Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez (born July 27, 1975 in New York City, New York). In the past, he played as shortstop for the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. He is currently first in runs scored and total bases; second in extra base hits and RBI, and 4th in hits among all players in baseball history since their 31st birthday. Also, Rodriguez has more HR, RBI, runs scored and more base hits than all-time leaders Hank Aaron (RBI), Barry Bonds (HR), Rickey Henderson (runs scored), and Pete Rose (hits) did before their 31st birthdays. He is the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs, breaking the record Jimmie Foxx set in 1939. He has been said to be one of the best all-around players currently in baseball. In 2009, he admitted to using steroids from 2001-2003, during his time with the Texas Rangers, in order to become better at baseball. His playing career ended in August of 2016. == References == == Other websites == * Alex Rodr√≠guez at The Internet Movie Database * AROD.com - Alex Rodriguez's official website * A-Rod's Salary: Watching for Collusion on Time.com * ESPN E-Ticket article - Alex Rodriguez 2007, King of Gotham? * Men's Vogue April 2008 feature article on A-Rod Category:American baseball players Category:Sportspeople from New York City Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:New York Yankees players Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:American League All-Stars Category:American philanthropists Category:Doping cases in sport Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Major League Baseball shortstops",
