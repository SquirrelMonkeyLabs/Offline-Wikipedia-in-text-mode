 "text": "The WAGR E class were a total of 65 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1902 to 1963. The E class were built by Nasmyth, Wilson & Coy of Salford, England and Vulcan Foundry of Newton-le-Willows, England for use on long-distance expresses. They were the first 4-6-2 locomotives in Australia, a further 20 were built in 1911 by the North British Locomotive Coy. Upon the E classes' entry into service, they were an immediate success and from 1924 to 1925 most were superheated, becoming the Es class. In 1934 two E class locos had their weight reduced becoming the Ea class, and several more were converted while being superheated and classified Eas. The last E class was withdrawn in 1963. No. 308 is preserved at the Bassendean Railway Museum. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
