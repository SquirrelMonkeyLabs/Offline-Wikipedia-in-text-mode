Their language was part of the Algonquian language family. They farmed the Three Sisters (maize, beans, and squash). They also did hunting and fishing along the Connecticut River. Many Pocumtuc died from European diseases. Many also died from wars with colonists.Thomas, Peter A. In the Maelstrom of Change: the Indian Trade and Cultural Process in the Middle Connecticut River Valley: 1635–1665. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Massachusetts—Amherst, 1979 The Pocumtuc allied with the Tunxis and Narragansett against the Mohegan and the Pequot. In King Philip's War, they fought against English colonists. The Pocumted eventually fled to New York. They later moved to Quebec and the West. They joined Abenaki tribes in Canada.Spady, James O'Neil. \"As if in a Great Darkness: Native American Refugees of the Middle Connecticut River Valley in the Aftermath of King Philip's War: 1677-1697,\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts, Vol. 23, no. 2 (Summer, 1995), 183-197. Today, many descendants of Pocumtuc live in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Canada. == References == Category:Native Americans",
