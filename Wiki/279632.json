It the only one native to Asia. This shows that the original distribution of its family was much wider, because all the other species are found in Central or South America. The scientific name refers to the East Indies, the species' natural habitat. In the Malay, the tapir is commonly referred to as \"cipan\", \"tenuk\" or \"badak tampong\". category:Mammals of Asia Category:Odd-toed ungulates",
