 "text": "Côte-des-Neiges is a working class neighborhood in Montreal, Canada. It is north of downtown on the other side of Mount Royal. The west side of the neighborhood is very ethnic with many shops that cater to this population. Most of the people here live in apartment buildings built after 1945. The eastern part of Côte-des-Neiges is more Québécois and more of an upperclass neighborhood. North America's largest church, St. Joseph's oratory, is here, as well as the University of Montreal.
