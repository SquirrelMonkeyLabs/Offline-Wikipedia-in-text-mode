 "text": "A link, also called a Gunterâ€™s link, was a unit of length in the imperial and US customary systems. Links were commonly used in measuring land in the English-speaking world before the twentieth century, but are never used. Link is abbreviated as ln. It was invented by Edmund Gunter, a professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, the same man who made the chain. He made the link as a low-technology piece of equipment that could survey small areas of land very accurately, whereas the chain could measure towns and large areas of land. 1 link = chain = / 7.92 inches = 201.168 millimetres=20.12 centimetres Category:Old units of measurement Category:Units of mass",
