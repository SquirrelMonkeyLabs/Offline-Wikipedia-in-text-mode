 "text": "Lars Ricken (born 10 July 1976) is a former German football player. He has played for Germany national team. Ricken is known for his long shot against Juventus in 1997 which helped Borussia Dortmund win the UEFA Champions League == Professional career == Born in Dortmund, Ricken joined local BV Borussia at an early age, and made his Bundesliga debut on 8 March 1994 in a 1–2 home defeat against VfB Stuttgart, aged not yet 18. From the following season onwards, he became a regular. Ricken scored a memorable long-distance goal in the final of the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League edition against Juventus F.C., which stood as the fastest in a final of the competition by a substitute, finding the net after just 16 seconds on the field. He also contributed with 8 goals in 47 matches in the team's back-to-back national titles (1994–96). In the following years, Ricken's success was hampered by a series of injuries. He gained his first cap for Germany on 10 September 1997, in a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Armenia, but missed that major international tournament as well as UEFA Euro 2000. Later, he restored his form, helping Dortmund to claim the league title in 2002 by scoring a career-best six goals and being selected by national coach Rudi Völler for the squad at that year's World Cup; he did not play in the competition, however, as Germany emerged runners-up. Ricken's injury woes returned after the World Cup and, as a consequence, he failed to earn recognition at both European or international level. In early April 2007, he was demoted to the reserve team by manager Thomas Doll, due to substandard performance. In November 2007, Ricken announced his retirement from football. In an attempt to return to football, he briefly attended a training camp in February 2008 with the Columbus Crew of the Major League Soccer, but returned to Germany and Dortmund after a few days. On 11 June 2008, Borussia Dortmund sport director Michael Zorc, also a former club footballer, announced that Ricken was to be hired as youth coordinator with immediate effect, while still appearing for the amateur side in Regionalliga West. However, on 16 February 2009, he announced his retirement from professional football. He is known to be one of the best players to play for the club Borussia Dortmund of all time. In one list, he came 2nd, falling behind Michael Zorc. ==Career statistics== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League Cup League Cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Borussia Dortmund 1993–94 Bundesliga 5 1 0 0 — 2Appearances in the UEFA Cup. 1 — 7 2 1994–95 Bundesliga 21 2 0 0 — 7 1 — 28 3 1995–96 Bundesliga 26 6 3 1 — 7Appearances in the UEFA Champions League. 2 — 36 9 1996–97 Bundesliga 23 2 1 0 — 9 4 1Appearances in the German Super Cup. 0 34 6 1997–98 Bundesliga 25 2 2 3 2 0 5 0 2Appearances in the UEFA Super Cup. 0 36 5 1998–99 Bundesliga 28 5 2 0 — — — 30 5 1999–2000 Bundesliga 29 4 1 0 2 0 11Appearances in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup. 0 — 43 4 2000–01 Bundesliga 29 6 3 1 — — — 32 7 2001–02 Bundesliga 28 6 1 0 2 0 15 4 — 46 10 2002–03 Bundesliga 24 4 1 0 1 1 11 0 — 37 5 2003–04 Bundesliga 23 2 2 0 2 0 5 2 — 32 4 2004–05 Bundesliga 17 5 1 0 — 2Appearances in the UEFA Intertoto Cup. 0 — 20 5 2005–06 Bundesliga 10 4 1 0 — — — 11 4 2006–07 Bundesliga 13 0 1 0 — — — 14 0 Total 301 49 19 5 8 1 74 14 3 0 405 69 Borussia Dortmund II 2002–03 Regionalliga Nord 1 0 — — — — 1 0 2003–04 Regionalliga Nord 1 0 — — — — 1 0 2004–05 Regionalliga Nord 4 2 — — — — 4 2 2006–07 Regionalliga Nord 11 5 — — — — 11 5 2007–08 Regionalliga Nord 19 1 — — — — 19 1 2008–09 Regionalliga West 3 0 — — — — 3 0 Total 39 8 — — — — 39 8 Career Total 340 57 19 5 8 1 74 14 3 0 444 77 ==Honours== ;Borussia Dortmund * Bundesliga: 1994–95, 1995–96, 2001–02 * DFL-Supercup: 1995, 1996 * UEFA Champions League: 1996–97 * Intercontinental Cup: 1997 ==References== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:German footballers Category:People from Dortmund Category:Sportspeople from North Rhine- Westphalia",
