 "text": "Chevrolet, also known as Chevy, is an American automobile manufacturer owned by General Motors. Chevrolet is known for producing popular, affordable cars. The company produces the Corvette, one of the most famous sports cars in the world. Chevrolet was founded in 1911 by both Arthur and Louis Chevrolet. Louis was a racing car driver. Chevy started using their \"bow-tie\" logo in 1913. It could have maybe come from a wallpaper that Chevrolet saw in a hotel. It could also be a version of the cross on the Swiss flag, due to Chevrolet having been born in Switzerland. In 1917, Chevrolet combined with General Motors. In 2002, GM acquired the recently bankrupt and former Daewoo Motorscompany of South Korea, and in 2011, the brand was folded into Chevy making the marque global market except for Austria. == Current production vehicles == ;Keys Body style Model Current generation Vehicle description Image Name(s) Introduction ( year) Introduction ( year) Update Main markets Crossover SUV Blazer 2018 2018 2022 North America and China Mid-size crossover mainly marketed in North America (two-row), and China (three-row).
