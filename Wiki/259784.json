 "text": "In physics, damping is any effect that tends to reduce the amplitude of vibrations.Tongue, Benson, Principles of Vibration, Oxford University Pres, 2001, In mechanics, the internal friction may be one of the causes of such damping effect. For many purposes the damping force Ff can be modeled as being proportional to the velocity v of the object: :::::::::F_{\\mathrm f} = -c v \\, , where c is the damping coefficient, given in units of Newton-seconds per meter. ==Related pages== * RLC circuit * Oscillator * Resonance * Seismic damper * Vibration * Vibration isolation * Vibration control ==References== Category:Mechanics Category:Mechanical vibrations Category:Earthquake engineering",
