 "text": "Jill Saward (14 January 1965 â€“ 5 January 2017) was an English campaigner on issues relating to sexual violence. She was born in Liverpool. Saward was the victim of the 1986 Ealing vicarage rape, a crime whose sentencing scandalized the UK and led indirectly to changes in the law. In 2009, she campaigned against a European Court of Justice ruling that DNA of people cleared of crimes must be deleted from the DNA Database after six years, or 12 years for serious crimes. Saward stood against David Davis in the 2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election in 2008. She lost the election after winning only 2.1% of the votes. Saward died on 5 January 2017 in Wolverhampton from a cerebral hemorrhage, aged 51. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:2017 deaths Category:English activists Category:British crime victims Category:English politicians Category:Writers from Liverpool",
