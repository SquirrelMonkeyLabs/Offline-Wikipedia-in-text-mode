During the 17th century, the navy of the Dutch Republic (1581–1795) was one of the most powerful naval forces in the world and played an active role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Franco-Dutch War, and wars against Spain and several other European powers. The Batavian Navy of the later Batavian Republic (1795–1806) and the Kingdom of Holland (1806–1810) played an active role in the Napoleonic Wars. In the modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, it served an important role in protecting Dutch colonial rule, especially in Southeast Asia. It played a minor role in World War II, especially against the Imperial Japanese Navy. Since World War II, the Royal Netherlands Navy has taken part in peacekeeping expeditions. The main naval base is in Den Helder, North Holland. Category:Organizations based in the Netherlands Category:Navies",
