 "text": "Hyloxalus picachos is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== Scientists have seen this frog on the ground in forests on hills and in low places. They have seen the frog in forests that were gone and are growing back, near streams. They did not see this frog in grassy places next to forests. Scientists saw this frog between 200 and 1600 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in one protected park: Parque Nacional Cordillera los Picachos. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. One problem is that the places where the frog lives are small and far apart because people cut down natural forest to build tree farms where cows can eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
