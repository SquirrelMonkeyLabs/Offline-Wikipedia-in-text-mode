House of Commons, House of Lords) and was mentioned for the first time during the early thirteenth century, and the first meeting one knows of was in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II of Scotland.K. Brown and R. Tanner, History of the Scottish Parliament, i, 'introduction'. The parliament, which is also referred to as the Estates of Scotland, the Three Estates the Scots Parliament or the auld Scots Parliament (), merged with the Parliament of England in the Acts of Union in 1707.
