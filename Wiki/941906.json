 "text": "In early July 2022, 63 of Britain's 179 government ministers, parliamentary private secretaries, and trade envoys resigned from their jobs in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's second administration. This created a lack of confidence in Johnson's leadership which then caused Johnson's own resignation on 7 July. On 5 July, after the Chris Pincher scandal, both Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resigned. A large number of other members of the government also resigned. Keir Starmer, Leader of the Opposition, criticised Johnson and Conservatives who remained in Cabinet at Prime Minister's Questions. By 7 July, sixty Members of Parliament (MPs) had resigned from government and party positions, with Michael Gove being fired by Johnson the day before. After two days of not wanting to step down, Johnson announced he would resign as Conservative Party leader. However, he did not leave the office of Prime Minister, stating he would only do so upon the announcement of a new leader. ==References== Category:July 2022 events Category:2022 in the United Kingdom",
