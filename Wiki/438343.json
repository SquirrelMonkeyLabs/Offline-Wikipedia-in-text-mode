 "text": "The Langar () is a common kitchen where food is served at a Sikh temple (Gurdwara). The concept of Langar was introduced by Guru Nanak, who was the founder of Sikhism and also the first Guru. Because of Guru Nanak's belief in the oneness of humanity and equality, he offered free meals to everyone. Every Gurdwara has a Temple, as required by the Guru Granth Sahib, and the food is served to all the visitors for free. At all Langar, only vegetarian food is served. It usually consists of bread (poori), yogurt and lentils. Samosas and spring rolls are served on special occasions. Kheer may be served as a dessert. Langar around the world are serving food to those in need everyday, and have done so for over the past 500 years. They are open to people of all castes, class, gender and religions. After a person eats at the Langar, they are not supposed to eat meat for the rest of the day. ==References== Category:Sikhism",
