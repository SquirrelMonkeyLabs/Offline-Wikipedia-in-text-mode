 "text": "A McMuffin is a breakfast sandwich from McDonald's, a popular fast food chain. The main one is the Egg McMuffin, made by Herb Peterson in 1972. It looks like eggs benedict, a classic American breakfast with English muffins, ham, eggs, and hollandaise sauce. The Egg McMuffin has a cracked Grade A egg on a toasted English muffin with real butter, Canadian bacon, and American cheese. The Egg McMuffin is a quick breakfast to eat, with 310 calories. Even though it seems simple, it actually has nearly 50 ingredients. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website * Category:Sandwiches Category:McDonald's foods",
