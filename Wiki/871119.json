 "text": "Daughters of the Polo God is a 2018 Indian documentary movie. It is in two languages: Meitei and English. Roopa Baruah directed it. Hemanti Sarkar edited it. The story is about saving the endangered Meitei horse (Manipuri pony) and empowering women in the sport of polo () at the same time. The movie is about Manipuri women in polo sports. In India, polo is mostly played by men. It also shows the way they work with their Meitei horses (Manipuri ponies). The players in the documentary work very hard so they can go to the annual polo tournament. The movie begins with Sagol Kangjei (), the ancient form of polo in Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). It was a war game. That means the sport was placed during peacetime so warriors could practice their war skills. It ended up with the present day advancements of the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association. It creates a cultural, ecological, historical and social relationship between the sport, the horses, and the ethnic groups of humans who live in that part of the world. == Background == The polo started in the far corner of the North East India (Ancient Manipur). It has been developed there for many centuries. At the same time, Women's empowerment has been very active in the history of Manipur. Roopa Barua, the maker of the \"Daughters of the Polo God\", took interest in these facts. So, she set her project on it. She said, > \"A young polo sisterhood is developing in Manipur that ploughs on in spite > of adversity and political turmoil. They are intensely connected to their > sacred Manipuri pony and play an international tournament every year. My > film is a tribute to these polo players, the modern Manipuri women and the > pony campaign.\" She spoke to the media that Manipuri girls are empowered a lot and have been able to play and do well for themselves. Before the beginning of the journey, the polo girls offered prayers to Marjing, the \"Polo God\" of Meitei religion, at his temple. And so, the name of the movie is also taken from the sense that the polo player girls are the daughters of their beloved father like Polo God of their own ethnic religion. Notably, it took over four years to complete the making of the movie. == Awards == The movie gets 6 international awards at 5 International Film Festivals. These are held at different countries of the world.
