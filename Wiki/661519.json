The aircraft exploded fourteen minutes after takeoff and disintegrated. == Summary == The aircraft had previously lost cabin pressure on 5 August. Earlier on the day of the crash it had departed Songshan Airport but the crew aborted the flight ten minutes later for the same reason. After repairs were made the aircraft departed Songshan Airport again and broke up shortly afterward. == Cause == There was early speculation that the crash was caused by a bomb. An investigation by the Republic of China Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that severe corrosion led to a pressure hull rupture. The severe corrosion was due to the many pressurization flight cycles the aircraft had experienced. The cracks produced were probably undetected. The wreckage was scattered across an area of south of Taipei. All 110 people onboard (110 passengers and crew, including eighteen Japanese citizens (among them Kuniko Muk≈çda)\"AIRLINER THAT CRASHED IN TAIWAN, KILLING 110, HAD PRESSURE SNAGS.\" Associated Press at The New York Times.
