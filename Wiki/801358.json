 "text": "Nickelodeon is an American television network that broadcasts children's programs. It began on December 1, 1977 using the name Pinwheel. The name was changed to Nickelodeon on April 1, 1979. The first program broadcast on Nickelodeon was Pinwheel. It was a preschool series created by Dr. Vivian Horner. Horner also created the idea for the channel itself. When it began, Nickelodeon was commercial-free. It mainly showed educational programs. By 1984, the channel began using co by commercials . They also started airing programs that were more for entertainment than education. In January 1988, the network began a block for preschoolers. It was called Nick Jr.. The block aired Pinwheel and other educational series. Around the same time, Nickelodeon began making its own animated programs. These were first aired in 1991 under the \"Nicktoons\" branding. ==Current programming== ===Original programming=== ====Animated (\"Nicktoons\")==== Title Premiere date Current season Last Aired SpongeBob SquarePants 14 The Loud House 7 January 14, 2025 Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years 1 The Patrick Star Show 2 Monster High 2 Transformers: EarthSpark 1 Rock Paper Scissors 1 1 {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" |Premiere date ! scope=\"col\" |Current season ! class=\"unsortable\" |Notes |- | scope=\"row\" |Tyler Perry's Young Dylan | |4 | |- | scope=\"row\" |The Really Loud House | |2 | |} =====News and sports===== Title Premiere date Current season Notes Nick News 3 NFL Slimetime 3 ====Preschool series==== Title Premiere date Current season Notes Blaze and the Monster Machines 8 Baby Shark's Big Show! 3 Face's Music Party 1 The Tiny Chef Show 2 Bossy Bear 1 ====Specials==== Title Premiere date Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards Nickelodeon Holiday Specials NFL on Nickelodeon ====Educational series==== Title Premiere date Kids Pick the President Nick Helps ===Acquired programming=== ====Animated==== Title Premiere date Current season Notes The Smurfs 2 ====Preschool series==== Title Premiere date Current season Notes PAW Patrol 10 Peppa Pig 7 The Adventures of Paddington 3 Moved to the Nick Jr. Channel after March 27, 2020 Rubble & Crew 2 ==Upcoming programming== ===Original programming=== ====Animated (\"Nicktoons\")==== Title Premiere date Notes Max & the Midknights ====Preschool series==== Title Premiere date Notes Super Duper Bunny League 2024 HexVet === Acquired programming === ==== Preschool series ==== Title Premiere date Notes Hamsters of Hamsterdale ==Former programming== ===Original programming=== ====Animated (\"Nicktoons\")==== Title Premiere date Finale date Note(s) Doug Rugrats The Ren & Stimpy Show Rocko's Modern Life Aaahh!!!
