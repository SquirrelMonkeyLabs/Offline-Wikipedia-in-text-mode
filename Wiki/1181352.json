 "text": "The Hungarian Democratic People’s Party (Hungarian: Magyar Demokrata Néppárt, MDNP) was a Christian-conservative party. It split from the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in 1996, participated in two elections, and then signed a reunification agreement with the MDF on April 2, 2005. == History == The Hungarian Democratic People’s Party started on March 4, 1996, when Iván Szabó and others left the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) after Szabó lost a leadership vote. Fifteen MPs, including well-known names like György Szabad, Géza Jeszenszky, and Imre Kónya, formed a group led by Szabó. In 1998, the MDNP didn’t get enough votes (5%) to win seats, so Szabó stepped down. Erzsébet Pusztai became leader and joined the Centre Party with other parties, but they only got 3.9% in 2002 and no seats. On April 2, 2005, MDNP rejoined the MDF. == Notes == Category:Defunct political parties in Hungary Category:Christian democratic parties Category:Conservative parties Category:1996 establishments in Europe Category:20th-century establishments in Hungary Category:2005 disestablishments in Europe",
