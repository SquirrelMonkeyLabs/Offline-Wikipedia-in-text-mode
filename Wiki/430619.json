 "text": "Libera is an all-boy singing group from England. It is directed by Robert Prizeman. There are roughly 40 members aged 7 to 16. They go to different schools in South London. Most members come from the parish choir of St. Philip's, Norbury, in South London. Libera record albums and goes on tour around the world. Libera is a not-for-profit organisation, registered as a charity in the UK. Most boys have unchanged boy soprano (also known as treble) voices. The boys in their early teens sing the lowest parts. Libera's songs are either new compositions by Robert Prizeman or new arrangements of classical and contemporary tunes. Prizeman often composes and arranges pieces with individual soloists in mind. He does this to emphasize the variety of characteristics and qualities in the boys' voices. == References == Category:Musical groups from London Category:Choirs",
