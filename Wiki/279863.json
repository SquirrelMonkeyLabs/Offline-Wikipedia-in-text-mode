 "text": "Windows on the World was a group of venues at the top floors (106th and 107th) of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. It included Windows on the World, a smaller restaurant which was called Wild Blue, and a bar which was called The Greatest Bar on Earth. The restaurant was destroyed in the September 11 attacks. In 2000, Windows on the World was the highest-earning restaurant in the United States. It earned a total of US$37 million. It has also been speculated that \"The Falling Man\" was Jonathan Briley, an audio technician at the Windows on the World restaurant but his identity was never released. There were plans to rebuild Windows on the World during the building of One World Trade Center but those plans were scrapped on March 7, 2011. ==References== ==Other websites== *Windows on the World (Archive) Category:American restaurants Category:September 11 attacks Category:Manhattan Category:Companies based in New York City Category:Defunct companies of the United States Category:2001 disestablishments in the United States",
