 "text": "Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa; ( or , from Quechua or ) is a species of goosefoot (Chenopodium). It is a grain-like crop grown primarily for its edible seeds. Quinoa is not a real cereal, or grain, but more of a vegetable, as it is not a member of the grass family. As a chenopod, quinoa is closely related to species such as beets, spinach, and tumbleweeds. Its leaves are also eaten as a leaf vegetable, much like amaranth. Quinoa greens are not widely available for purchase. Quinoa gives high quality protein and other nutrients. It has been called a 'superfood'. In February 2018, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak was mocked by the opposition for saying he no longer eats rice and now eats quinoa, which he claimed is healthier. He said his son introduced him to quinoa. Opposition leaders, including Mahathir Mohamad, criticized him for choosing the expensive quinoa, with Mahathir tweeting, \"I only eat local rice.\" File:Reismelde.jpg File:Quinoa.jpg File:500g bag of quinoa.jpeg File:Quinoa-cornflakes.jpg File:Chenopodium quinoa -red faro- MHNT.BOT.2007.43.66.jpg|Chenopodium quinoa -red faro- - Museum specimen == References == Category:Amaranthaceae Category:Edible nuts and seeds https://www.nasimahealth.com/is-quinoa-keto/",
