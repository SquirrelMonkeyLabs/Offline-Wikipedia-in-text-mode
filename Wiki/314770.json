 "text": "Karl Barth (1886-1968) was a Protestant theologian who started a movement in theology that is now called Neo-Orthodoxy. He wrote Church Dogmatics and the Gottingen Dogmatics, as well as a number of Biblical commentaries, most famously on the Book of Romans. He was heavily involved in the authorship of the anti-Nazi Barmen declaration in 1934. Barth rejects Biblical inerrancy, and he also rejects stronger forms of predestination. == Other websites == * Theopedia on Karl Barth and the Theology of Karl Barth Category:1886 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Swiss theologians Category:Writers from Basel",
