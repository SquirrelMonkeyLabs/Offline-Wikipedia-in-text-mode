 "text": "On 11 September 2024, police in Malaysia started Operation Global (Malay:) to investigate reports of child abuse and forced labor at homes and businesses linked to GISB Holdings. The operation rescued 625 victims, aged 2 to 28, and arrested 415 people. Sixty of those arrested were held under a special law for serious crimes. == Background == GISB Holdings is a company linked to the banned group Al-Arqam. Al-Arqam was a religious group in Malaysia that was outlawed in 1994 because its teachings were seen as going against Islamic beliefs. The group’s leader, Ashaari Mohammad, claimed to receive divine messages and was accused of creating a cult-like following. The Malaysian government banned Al-Arqam to stop its influence. After the ban, former members of Al-Arqam set up GISB Holdings in 1997. The company started as a way for members to continue working together. It grew into a large business with many kinds of work, such as farming, restaurants, and property development. GISB operates in several countries and often promotes itself as a company that follows Islamic values. GISB, however, has faced many accusations over the years. Critics say the company uses children for work, forces women into early marriage, and pressures members to give all their money to the group. These claims have led to many investigations and lawsuits in Malaysia and other countries. GISB has always denied these accusations and says it is a lawful business. In September 2024, reports of abuse at GISB-run homes led to Operation Global, a major police action to rescue children and investigate the company. This event has brought new attention to GISB and its controversial past. == Raids and arrests == On 11 September 2024, the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) raided 20 children’s homes run by GISB Holdings Sdn Bhd after receiving reports of abuse. The raids rescued 402 children, including boys and girls aged between one and 17 years old. Many of these children were believed to be the children of GISB members working abroad. Police said some children showed signs of physical and sexual abuse, including 13 cases of suspected sodomy. Health checks confirmed that 384 of the children had been harmed. Former GISB members shared their stories of abuse. One woman, Zoey, said she was forced to marry at 17 and suffered abuse for 14 years before escaping in 2021 with her nine children. Another former member, Ummu Atiyah, said she was locked up for a month and forced to marry a GISB leader. She provided police with details of her abuse. By 23 October 2024, the police had rescued a total of 625 victims, arrested 415 people, and detained 60 under special laws for organized crime and national security. == GISB's response == GISB denied the accusations made against them during Operation Global. On 12 September 2024, the company released a statement rejecting claims of child abuse and forced labor. They described the allegations of sodomy as false and said their homes follow strict moral and religious values. GISB’s CEO, Nasiruddin Mohd Ali, acknowledged during a press conference on 19 September that there had been \"one or two isolated cases\" of wrongdoing but strongly denied that such actions were part of the company’s practices. He claimed the accusations of human trafficking and exploitation were exaggerated and said GISB would defend its reputation in court. GISB also emphasized its role as a lawful business promoting Islamic values and helping its members live according to their faith. The company criticized the raids as damaging to its image and argued that the authorities were targeting it unfairly due to its ties to the banned Al-Arqam group. Nasiruddin and other GISB leaders are fighting their detention under Malaysia’s Security Offenses (Special Measures) Act. They argue that their arrest is unlawful and say they will provide evidence to clear their names in court. GISB’s legal team has also raised concerns about the treatment of their members in detention and the freezing of the company’s assets, calling these actions excessive and unjustified. GISB continues to insist that its operations are ethical and that the charges are baseless. == Aftermath == Some members of GISB have been charged with crimes like child abuse and forced labor. One worker was sentenced to 10 years in jail for abusing children. Nasiruddin Mohd Ali and his wife are challenging their detention under Malaysia’s special security laws. The court will hear their case in December 2024. Authorities are still investigating GISB’s financial activities, including possible violations of Malaysia's money laundering laws. Investigations in other countries are also ongoing, though no charges have been filed outside Malaysia. Many GISB homes and businesses in Malaysia were shut down after the raids. Police froze RM882,795.94 and seized cars, land, and cash. The state of Melaka also removed the CEO’s honorary title of \"Datuk.\" Seven states in Malaysia said GISB teachings were not in line with Islam and connected GISB to Al-Arqam’s banned ideas. Police are still looking into claims that children were shown extremist videos. == References == Category:Child abuse incidents and cases Category:Controversies in Malaysia",
