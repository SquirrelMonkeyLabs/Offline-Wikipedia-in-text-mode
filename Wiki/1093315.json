 "text": "HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) is a type of ammunition that is used to destroy tanks and similar vehicles. HEAT ammunition consists of an explosive, propellant, firing system and case for the ammunition It is shaped like a bullet but it uses a cylinder for the tip instead of the tip being rounded or pointed. When the HEAT round hits a hard surface (like a tanks armour) it will explode. The cylinder tip of the HEAT round will focus the energy of the blast into a molten jet. This is called the Munroe effect. This molten jet is good at getting through lots of armour. Militaries often use this type of ammunition to destroy tanks. ==References== Category:Ammunition",
