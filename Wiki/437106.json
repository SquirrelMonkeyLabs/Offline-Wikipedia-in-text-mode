 "text": "The Chicago Stadium (nicknamed the 'Madhouse on Madison') was an indoor sports arena and theater in Chicago, Illinois. It opened in 1929, and closed in 1994. It was demolished in 1995 because the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls moved to the United Center. Michael Jordan played his prime years and the Bulls won their first three championships while using Chicago Stadium. The Stadium hosted the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL from 1929-1994 and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA from 1967â€“1994. The arena was the site of the first NFL playoff game in 1932; the 1932, 1940, and 1944 Democratic National Conventions; and the 1932 and 1944 Republican National Conventions. The Chicago Blackhawks, also previously known as the Chicago Stadium Corporation, and not the Bulls, are the actual owners of both Chicago Stadium and the United Center. ==References== ==Other websites== *Chicago Stadium's Basketball History *Chicago Stadium's Ice Hockey History *A web page devoted to the fabled Chicago Stadium Barton organ *Remembering The Big Barn on W.
