 "text": "In fiction, a plot hole is a part of a story that goes against something that has already been stated. These may include events that should not happen according for in-universe reasons, events that seem unlikely or events that contradict earlier events in the narrative. The term can also be used to describe a situation that has not been resolved by the end of the plot, even though there will be no continuing story. == Related pages == * Plot (narrative) * Continuity * Deus ex machina Category:Fiction",
