 "text": "The Office of United States Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was established by U.S. President Harry Truman on January 23 1946 with Admiral Sidney Souers occupying the position. The DCI was coordinating intelligence activities among and between the various United States intelligence agencies, also called the American Intelligence Community. Until April 2005, the DCI also served as de facto Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and was often referred to colloquially as the \"CIA Director.\" After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and the subsequent investigation by the 9/11 Commission, a movement grew to re-organize the Intelligence Community. That movement prompted the creation, on April 21, 2005, of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), in whose purview was the job portfolio that had been performed previously by the Director of Central Intelligence. The latter position then ceased to exist. ==List of Directors of Central Intelligence (in chronological order)== Director Tenure RADM Sidney Souers, USNR January 23 1946–June 10 1946 LTG Hoyt S.
