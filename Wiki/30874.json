Daft Punk used analog synthesizers and other real instruments to make their music. On 22 February 2021 they released the video \"Epilogue\" that announced the end of Daft Punk as a group. == History == === 1987–1994: Group starts as Darlin' === Both of the Daft Punk members went to the same school in Paris. They became friends and recorded a demo track with other students from the school. Thomas Bangalter played bass guitar, and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo played guitar. They formed a band called Darlin'. Darlin' had another member named Laurent Brancowitz. Darlin' did not last very long. Brancowitz left the group and joined Phoenix. This was a band his younger brother, Christian Mazzalai was in. After a concert in the United Kingdom, a newspaper said the band's music was \"daft punk\" (silly punk music). Thomas and Guy-Manuel liked the words \"daft punk\". They made a new music group named Daft Punk. While attending a rave at EuroDisney, they met Stuart MacMillan of Slam. He let them join the record label Soma Quality Recordings based in Glasgow. Daft Punk recorded their first demo. It was called \"The New Wave\". They made other demos, such as \"Alive\" and \"Da Funk\". Both of these were on the group's first album. === 1995–1998: Homework === In 1995, Daft Punk recorded a song named \"Da Funk\".
