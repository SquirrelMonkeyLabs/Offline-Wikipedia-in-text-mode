The first prototype flew on May 12, 1936. The plane was used by the German Luftwaffe in the World War II. In Germany it was called Zerst√∂rer (the destroyer). Early in the war Germany had great success with the plane until they attacked Great Britain. In the Battle of Britain the Bf 110C was no match for Britain's Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters. The planes designed as escorts (to bombers) had to be escorted themselves. They were slow in turns which was a major flaw in the design. The Hurricane's could out-turn them and the Spitfires could out-run them. After very heavy losses they were withdrawn from the battle. The Bf 110s were reassigned to other duties. One role they were well suited for was as night fighters. Major Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, Germany's top night fighter ace, claimed 121 victories flying a Bf 110. == References == Category:World War II German aircraft",
