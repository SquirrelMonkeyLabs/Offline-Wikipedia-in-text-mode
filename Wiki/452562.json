 "text": "A pivot table is a data summary tool. It is found in programs such as spreadsheets or databases. A pivot-table can automatically sort, total or give the average of the data stored in a table. It displays the results in a second table (called a \"pivot table\"). The pivot table shows the summarized data. Most pivot tables do not automatically update when the spreadsheet or database it is based on changes.John Walkenbach, Excel 2007 Bible (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2013), p. 591 == References == Category:Spreadsheet software",
