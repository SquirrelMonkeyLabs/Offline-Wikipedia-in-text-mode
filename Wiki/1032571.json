It is part of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. The Greater Manchester Transport Committee, made up of 33 councillors appointed from the ten Greater Manchester boroughs and the Mayor of Greater Manchester, decide what it is to do. It was called the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive until 2011. It owns Manchester Metrolink and Greater Manchester's Cycle Hire scheme, and is responsible for cycling and walking infrastructure. It owns and maintains the bus stations, stops & shelters, but does not manage the bus or rail services. It plans to manage the buses using the powers in the Bus Services Act 2017. It has set up the Bee Network, an integrated transport network for Greater Manchester. ==References== Category:Organisations based in Greater Manchester Category:Transport in England",
