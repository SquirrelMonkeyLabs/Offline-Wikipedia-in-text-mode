 "text": "Isotope electrochemistry is a field within electrochemistry concerned with various topics like electrochemical separation of isotopes, electrochemical estimation of isotopic exchange equilibrium constants, electrochemical kinetic isotope effect, electrochemical isotope sensors, etc. Chemists are actively working in this area. It overlaps with many other chemistry areas of both theoretical and practical importance like nuclear engineering, electrochemical technology, geochemistry, sensors and instrumentation. ==Notes== ==Other websites== *electrochemical investigation using isotopic effects *http://hydrobor.com.tr/bilgi-bankasi/.../Ti%20Ni%20intermetallic%20phases.pdf *electrochemical isotope separation *electrochemical isotope cell *electroplating isotope effects *JES electrochemical pumping isotope effects *electrochemical isotope fractionation *http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/aesj/publication/JNST2002/No.4/39_367-370.pdf *http://www.springerlink.com/content/u0x0t427w1146146/ *http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.196707571/abstract Category:Physical chemistry Category:Isotopes",
