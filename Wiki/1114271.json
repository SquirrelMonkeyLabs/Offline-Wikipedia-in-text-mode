 "text": "Velchanos properly Welchanos (), Gelchanos (), or Elchanos (), is an ancient Minoan god associated with vegetation, worshipped in Crete. He was one of the main deities in the Minoan pantheon and later became conflated with the Greek god Zeus. == Influence == The cult of Velchanos influenced the cult of Zeus in Mycenaean Greece after contact with the Minoans. Zeus was at times referred to as Zeus Velchanos. There are also suggestions of influence on the Roman deity Vulcan. == Origins == In Minoan religion, Velchanos was a god associated with vegetation and was worshipped in Crete. His worship was part of a broader religious context that included rituals, sacred spaces, and other deities representing natural phenomena. The Minoans’ religious beliefs were richly depicted in their art, with symbols such as the snake, dove, and double axe. During the Mycenaean period, Velchanos captured the attention of the Mycenaeans, leading to religious syncretism where they identified their own god Zeus with Velchanos. This syncretism had a lasting impact on Greek mythology == Worship == The worship practices of Velchanos in Minoan religion are largely reconstructed from archaeological evidence, as there are no readable texts from the period. Artifacts such as paintings, statuettes, vessels for rituals, and seals and rings provide insights into how Velchanos was venerated. These items often depict symbols and scenes associated with the deity, suggesting that rituals and ceremonies were an integral part of his worship. Prominent Minoan sacred symbols include the bull, horns of consecration, labrys double-headed axe, and possibly the serpent. These symbols are believed to be connected to Velchanos and other deities in the Minoan pantheon. The bull symbolizes strength and fertility, while the horns of consecration may represent sacred power. The labrys, a double-headed axe, is a symbol of authority and ritual sacrifice. The serpent could symbolize regeneration or protection. These symbols were depicted in various artifacts and might have played a role in rituals dedicated to Velchanos. Minoan sacred symbols were depicted on various artifacts such as reliefs, masonry, and frescoes. These symbols were associated with fertility, nature, and the connection between the Minoan gods and humanity. For example: * The Double Horns: Also known as the bull’s horns, this was a common symbol representing strength and fertility. * The Labrys: This double-headed axe symbolized authority and was possibly used in ritual sacrifices. * The Serpent: Often associated with regeneration or protection. These symbols were integral to Minoan religious practice, which was not centered around massive formal public temples but rather involved more intimate rituals and sacred spaces. == Iconography == Minoan iconography is rich with symbols and images that reflect their religious beliefs and rituals. Some key elements include: * The Labrys (Double Axe): A common symbol found in Minoan religious contexts, often associated with the goddess, which may have been used in rituals of sacrifice or purification. * Clay Figurines: These are found in the form of animals, human votaries, and parts of the human body such as feet, eyes, and genitalia. They reflect the concerns of the worshippers—their own fertility and well- being and that of their animals. These symbols were not just decorative but held significant meaning in Minoan religion, representing various aspects of their power and presence. The iconography provides insights into how the Minoans perceived their gods and their relationship with them. ==References== Category:Greek mythology",
