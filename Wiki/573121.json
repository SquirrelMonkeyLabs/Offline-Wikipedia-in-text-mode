 "text": "Yigal Amir, Hebrew: יגאל עמיר , (born May 23, 1970 in Herzliya) is an Israeli murderer. Amir is serving a life sentence in prison for assassinating Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995. His motivation was political. He was strongly against the Oslo Accords and targeted Rabin because of his peace efforts with the Palestinians, which he saw as against the interests of Israeli Jews. Amir is an Orthodox Jew from a Yemenite Jewish background. At the time of the murder he was studying law and computer science at Bar-Ilan University and also Jewish law. Because he murdered the country's head of government, this made Amir an assassin. He was found guilty and sent to prison, where he still is. Israel does not have the death penalty. == Related pages == * Zionism * Zionist militias * Nathuram Godse == References == * Haaretz Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli prisoners Category:Jewish Israeli criminals Category:Murderers Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment",
