It lives in places made of sandstone and in rocky places in grassland. People see them near streams. Scientists saw the frog between 500 and 1200 meters above sea level. The frog lives in one protected park, Valle de Tucavaca. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. They carry them to pools and puddles that are not there all year. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings start fires to make it easier to make places for cows to eat grass. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
