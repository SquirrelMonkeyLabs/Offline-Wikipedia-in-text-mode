 "text": "On 9 June 2023, four children were rescued from the Amazon rainforest, in Colombia after they survived a plane crash on 1 May. The Cessna 206 plane was carrying seven people which included a woman and her four children. All three adults were killed, leaving the children to fend for themselves in the forest. However, all the four children—aged 13, 9, 4 and a 11-month-old toddler— survived in the jungle for nearly 40 days. According to the rescuers, the children were malnourished, and had many insect bites, but no major health issues. According to media, the children belong to an indigenous community, living in or near the jungle. The 13 year old also seems to have been used to guarding the other children, when their mother was at work. The plane crashed in a region of the rainforest that is difficult to access. When it was discovered there were survivors, a large-scale rescue operation was ordered by the authorities. == References == ==Other websites== *Image of the found children and their rescuers. * Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2023 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in South America Category:June 2023 events Category:2020s in Colombia Category:2023 in South America",
