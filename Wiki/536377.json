 "text": "In case law, a test case is a legal action whose purpose is to set a precedent. An example of a test case might be a person who files a lawsuit in order to see if the court considers a certain law or a certain legal precedent applies in certain circumstances. This is useful, for example, in order to later file similar lawsuits in similar circumstances. Sometimes, lawyers delay filing a lawsuit to wait and see how a test case is decided. Test cases are sometimes used to challenge a law to have it possibly overturned. Government agencies sometimes bring test cases in order to confirm or expand their powers. The decision in a test case may be a landmark decision. ==Examples== Examples of influential test cases include: # Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) # Scopes v. Tennessee (1925) # United States v. One Book Called Ulysses (1933) # Brown v. Board of Education (1954) # Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) # Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State v. Oneida County (1974) # Adams v Cape Industries plc (1990) # Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992) # National Westminster Bank plc v Spectrum Plus Limited (2005) # District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) == Notes == ==References== Category:Legal terms",
