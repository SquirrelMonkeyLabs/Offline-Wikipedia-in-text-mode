 "text": "On December 19, 2023, a Eurocopter AS-350 Astar operated by the news station 6abc under WPVI-TV, known as \"Chopper 6\", crashed near Wharton State Forest, New Jersey shortly after 8:00 PM EST. Both of the crew members, the only people aboard, died in the accident. == Accident flight == The chopper departed Northeast Philidelphia Airport at around 7:30 PM EST, enroute to cover a news story near the Jersey Shore. After completing their assignment, the two crew then began flying back to Northeast Philidelphia Airport. While flying over Wharton State Forest, the aircraft began descending. The helicopter crashed into trees at a very shallow angle, however the chopper had a very high speed. The aircraft fragmented and a post-crash fire began. Both crew members were killed. ==Victims== The victims of the Chopper 6 Crash were 67-year-old pilot Monroe Smith who had been with 6abc for 20 years. 45-year- old photographer Christopher Dougherty was also killed in the accident. He was with the news station for about 18 years. ==Investigation== On January 17th, 2024, the National Transportation Safety Board released their preliminary report into the accident. The NTSB found that the four main rotor blades and the tail rotor blades were all broken, meaning that the chopper had power when it impacted the trees. The investigators also confirmed that there was no inflight fire or explosion that brought down the helicopter. They stated that they found no issues with the engine. Investigators made note that the aircraft had come out of maintenance the day of the accident and that they would be further investigating the possibility of a mechanical failure, among other possible causes. No possible cause of the crash was included in the report. ==References== Category:New Jersey Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2023 Category:December 2023 events",
