 "text": "Shia Islam (, ) is the second largest branch of Islam. Shia Muslim believe that Prophet Muhammad under the command of God chose Ali as Caliph (or Successor) and publicly declared it during his last sermon after Hajj at Ghadir Khumm. Shi'a Muslims believe in the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad's family, whom they call the Ahl al-Bayt. The Shias think that the first three ruling Sunni Caliphs had no importance to the development of the faith. The singular/adjective form is Shī'ī () and means a follower. Shi'a Islam, like Sunni Islam, has at times been divided into many branches, however only three of these have a significant number of followers nowadays. The best known and the one with most adherents is Twelvers (Ithnā 'ashariyya), followed by the Ismaili and Zaidiyyah. ==Terminology== The term \"Shia\" comes from the Arabic phrase \"Shīʿat ʿAlī,\" meaning \"followers of Ali.\" Shia Islam refers to the group of Muslims who believe that after Prophet Muhammad's death, leadership of the Muslim community should have gone to Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, and his descendants. The Shia believe that Ali was chosen by Muhammad as his successor, and that leadership should stay within Ali's family. This belief is seen as supported by the Quran and Islamic history, with Shia scholars citing verses that highlight the special status of the family of certain prophets, including Ali. ==Sources== * Shia Code, the Shia Islamic Guide * List of Shi'a websites * Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project * Al-Shia Website * ==References== Category:Shia Islam",
