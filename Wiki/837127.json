 "text": "At the 1900 Summer Olympics, an association football tournament was contested for the first time. Only two demonstration matches were held between the three club sides, and no medals were awarded. France's representatives were determined by the USFSA, which elected the Parisian champion Club Français. For Belgium, after Racing Club de Bruxelles declined to participate, a student selection with players from the Université libre de Bruxelles was sent by the Federation.The team was reinforced with a few non-students. On the other hand, English club Upton Park F.C. represented Great Britain. Despite this, the International Olympic Committee currently credits Great Britain, France and Belgium with gold, silver and bronze medals respectively as part of its attempt to reconcile early Olympic Games with the modern award scheme. The football matches were held at the Vélodrome de Vincennes in Paris. ==Venue== ==Squads== == Matches == In the first game, the British squad had little difficulty defeating the USFSA XI. Upton Park led 2–0 after the first half, getting two more goals in the second to win 4–0. Gaston Peltier scored in the first minute to give the USFSA XI an early lead, but Université de Bruxelles scored twice to take a 2–1 first half lead. The French scored five goals in the second half, however, to take the match 6–2.
