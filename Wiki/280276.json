 "text": "The Northern Isles Old Norse: Nor√∞reyjar; Scots Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan Tuath; Scots: Northren Isles are a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The group includes Shetland, Fair Isle and Orkney. Sometimes Stroma is included, which is part of Caithness. ==Culture and politics== The Northern Isles are usually separated for political purposes, but they come under the Orkney and Shetland parliamentary constituency in Westminster. Due to their history, the islands have a Norse, rather than a Gaelic flavour, and have historic links with the Faroes, Iceland, and Norway. Orkney and Shetland were given to Scotland as a deposit on the dowry of Margaret of Denmark when she married James III of Scotland in 1469. == References == Category:Islands of Scotland",
