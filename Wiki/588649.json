He was one of the few Sunni Muslims to make it to the top of the Alawite-dominated Syrian leadership. He was long known as a loyalist of Hafez al-Assad, and held a strong position within the Syrian government until he resigned his positions and fled the country in 2005 in protest against certain policies of Hafez's son and successor, Bashar al-Assad. He served as interim President of Syria from 10 June 2000 to 17 July 2000 when Hafez al-Assad died in June 2000. He was later replaced by Bashar al-Assad. Khaddam died on 31 March 2020 in Paris, France of a heart attack, aged 87. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Presidents of Syria Category:Vice presidents",
