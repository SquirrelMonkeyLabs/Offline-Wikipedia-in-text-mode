 "text": "Kamsa (, Kaṃsa) was the tyrant ruler of the Vrishni Kingdom, with its capital in Mathura. He is described in various Hindu texts as either a human or an asura (demon). While the Puranas portray him as an asura, the Harivamsha describes him as an asura reborn in the body of a man. He belonged to the Bhoja dynasty, which earned him the name \"Bhojapati\". Kamsa was a cousin of Devaki, the mother of Krishna, and was eventually killed by Krishna, fulfilling a prophecy. == Early life and ambition == Kamsa was born to King Ugrasena and Queen Padmavati. Despite his royal lineage, Kamsa was highly ambitious and desired to take control of the throne. He overthrew his father, seizing power as the King of Mathura, encouraged by his allies Banasura and Narakasura. Kamsa's rise to power also involved strategic alliances, including his marriage to Asti and Prapti, the daughters of Jarasandha, the King of Magadha. == Prophecy and imprisonment of Devaki == According to legend, during the wedding of Kamsa's cousin Devaki to Vasudeva, a divine voice from the heavens prophesied that Devaki's eighth son would kill him. In a rage, Kamsa nearly killed Devaki but was stopped by Vasudeva, who promised to hand over each of their children to him. Kamsa imprisoned Devaki and Vasudeva, and murdered their first six children. === Balarama and Krishna === Devaki's seventh child, Balarama, was saved when the deity Vishnu ordered the goddess Mahamaya to transfer the fetus to the womb of Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva. Balarama was born in Gokula and raised there. The eighth child, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, was secretly taken to Gokula after his birth. There, he was raised by Nanda and Yashoda. == Attempts to kill Krishna == Upon learning of Krishna's birth, Kamsa sent numerous asuras and demons to kill the child. These demons included: * **Putana**, a demoness who attempted to poison Krishna by nursing him with her deadly milk. Krishna, however, sucked the life out of her instead. * **Trinavarta**, a whirlwind demon who tried to abduct Krishna but was also defeated. * **Aghasura**, a serpent demon, and **Bakasura**, a crane demon, who were similarly defeated by Krishna. == Death == Finally, Krishna and Balarama traveled to Mathura to confront Kamsa. Upon their arrival, Kamsa arranged for them to be killed in a wrestling match, but Krishna overpowered and slew him, fulfilling the prophecy that had haunted Kamsa since Devaki’s wedding. After Kamsa's death, Ugrasena was reinstated as the king of Mathura, and peace was restored to the kingdom. == Legacy == Kamsa is often portrayed as the archetypal villain in Krishna's legends, representing tyranny, fear, and ego. His actions led to divine intervention and his eventual downfall serves as a reminder of the victory of righteousness (dharma) over evil (adharma) in Hindu philosophy. == In popular culture == Kamsa’s character has been depicted in various forms of art, literature, and performing arts. He is a central figure in many retellings of Krishna's childhood, including television series and traditional Indian art forms like Yakshagana. == Related pages == * Krishna * Vasudeva * Balarama * Mahabharata == References == == Other websites == * The Legend of Kamsa from Sacred Texts * The Story of Kamsa: Britannica Category:Mahabharata",
