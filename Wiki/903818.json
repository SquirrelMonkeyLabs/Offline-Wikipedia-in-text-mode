 "text": "Stockfish is made by drying fish. In many northern countries, people dry fish to make it last longer without going bad. The fish is dried by putting it on wooden racks. It is left outside, exposed to air and wind.Kurlansky, chapter 3 No salt is used. In Norway, the wooden racks are called \"hjell\". They are located on the foreshore. The drying of food is the world's oldest known preservation method. Dried fish have a storage life of several years. The method is cheap and effective in suitable climates. The work can be done by the fisherman and family. The resulting product is easily taken to a market to be sold. == Gallery == File:Cod drying in Lyngen.JPG|Cod hung for drying in Lyngen fjord, Norway File:Stockfisch in Iceland 2005.JPG|Stockfish up for drying in Iceland File:Fiskvinnslukonur-1910-1920-kirkjusandur.jpg|Women working with stock fish in Iceland c. 1915 File:Salmon drying.
