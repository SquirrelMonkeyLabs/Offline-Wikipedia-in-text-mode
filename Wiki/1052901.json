The war began on 7 October 2023, which was Simchat Torah (also known as Shemini Atzeret), a major festival and holiday on the Jewish calendar. That morning, Palestinian terror groups from Gaza launched a military offensive on Israel called Operation Al Aqsa Flood. These groups, led by Hamas, launched about 4200 missiles into Israeli population centers, and 3800 militants entered Israel by land, air, and sea. Their offensive killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and foreigners, and they took about 245 people hostage. The Israeli Defense Forces' response, Operation Iron Swords, eliminated 23 out of Hamas's 24 battalions. The operation has caused the death of over 40,000 Palestinians, including militants. Hamas stated that their offensive was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of unauthorized Israeli settlements, and the increase in Israeli settler violence. == Names == Different groups use different terms to refer to the war: * Palestinian militant groups call it Operation al-Aqsa Flood (amaliyyat ṭūfān al-ʾAqṣā) * Israeli authorities call its counteroffensive Operation Iron Swords (Mivtsá charavót barzél). * Some news agencies and commentators have called the ongoing conflict the Third Intifada (following the First and Second Intifadas). * Others have called it the Sukkot War, after the holiday celebrated the day the conflict started. == October 7, 2023 == The war began with the October 7th attacks (sometimes called the October 7th massacre).
