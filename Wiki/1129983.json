 "text": "The San Vicente rocket frog (Hyloxalus pumilus) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 16.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 12.4â€“18.1 mm long. There are two spots on the throat and chest. The adult female frog has a white belly. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in a cloud forest on a mountain 2987 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists are not sure how the frog makes its young, but they think the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== This frog is in big danger of dying out and they might all be dead now. If they are not all dead, then only 249 or fewer are alive today. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms and get wood to build with. Trout fish that people brought to the frog's home can also hurt this frog. Scientists have seen the fungal disease chytridiomycosis on other frogs in Hyloxalus, so they think the disease could hurt this frog too. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
