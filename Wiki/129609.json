 "text": "Oxbridge is a word that is used to mean the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in England. It used to mean a fictional mix of the two universities, but now refers to both in real life. The word 'Oxbridge' started because the two universities are very similar: * They are the two oldest universities in England; both were started more than 800 years ago. * They were the only universities in England until the 19th century. * Between them they have produced a large number of Britain's most well known scientists, writers, and politicians,Famous alumni and students of Cambridge University as well as famous people in many other jobs.Carole Cadwalladr on the Oxbridge elite | higher news | EducationGuardian.co.uk * Also, they both share a similar college system, as each university is made up of separate colleges. The competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to the days when Cambridge was founded by unsatisfied scholars from Oxford. ==References== ==Other websites== * University of Cambridge * University of Oxford * The Oxbridge boat race * The Varsity Match Category:University of Cambridge Category:University of Oxford",
