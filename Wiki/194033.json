 "text": "Hans Moleman is a character in The Simpsons. His voice is from Dan Castellaneta, and was first seen at the episode \"Scary Movie\". He is in a running gag, where he usually suffers bad, nearly always sad, events. ==Role in The Simpsons== ===Biography=== Hans Moleman is the retconned name of the character. He looks old, but he claims to be only 31 years old, (in 1993's \"Selma's Choice\", his driver's license says he was born August 2, 1961, and in \"Duffless\", Moleman confessed his real age at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, implying that his ugly appearance has been caused by severe alcoholism) but Moleman was in the Springfield Retirement Home in Season 10's \"The Old Man and the \"C\" Student\". In the episode Little Girl in the Big Ten in season 13, he said he was eighty years old. He has cataracts and is almost completely blind (which has messed up his reading ability and has led to revokings of his driver's license over and over) and has used medical marijuana. He always has a brown cane, that once had a sword in it. In “Springfield’s Anthem”, it is revealed that Moleman was the previous mayor of Springfield and was the one to buy their anthem from a salesman who sold the song to other towns. When confronted, Moleman said me “never expected anyone to leave town” over the centuries of his life. ==References== Category:The Simpsons characters de:Figuren aus Die Simpsons#Ralph Melish (Hans Maulwurf)",
