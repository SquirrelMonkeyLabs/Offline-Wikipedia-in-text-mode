 "text": "The Manipur bush quail (, ) is a species of quail found in Manipur and other Northeastern Indian regions. It lives in humid and moist grasslands, particularly among tall grasses. It was first collected and described by Allan Octavian Hume on a mission to study about birds of Manipur in 1881. P. manipurensis is listed as \"Endangered\" on the IUCN's Red List. Its home place is small, separated and fastly becoming smaller. No one was confirmed of seeing the bird from 1932 until June 2006. In 2006, Anwaruddin Choudhury reported seeing the quail in Assam. BBC News reported the speech of the conservation director of the Wildlife Trust of India, Rahul Kaul, as \"This creature has almost literally returned from the dead.\" == History == There is a 1911 report by Frank Finn. It was based on Captain Wood's field notes of 1899. It noted that the species was common in the past. Captain Wood noted that the bird was commonly trapped by Manipuri people after bush fires. Further, he also noted the Manipuri language name was lanz-soibol (literally meaning \"trap quail\"). == References == == Other websites == Category:Flora and fauna of Manipur Category:Birds of Northeast India Category:Phasianidae",
