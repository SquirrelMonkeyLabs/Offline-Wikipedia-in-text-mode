 "text": "The Roraima rocket frog (Anomaloglossus roraima) is a frog. Scientists found it in Guyana and Venezuela. Scientists think it may also live in Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 16.5–19.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult females frog is about 16.5–19.3 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color, sometimes with darker marks. The tops of all four legs are lighter in color with small white marks, sometimes with some red color. The bottoms of the legs are darker. The front legs have dark brown stripes. The sides of the body can have darker colors. The belly is yellow or reddish in color, sometimes with dark brown marks. The ends of the toes can have blue color. The iris of the eye is brown in color on top and darker in the middle and light on the bottom. ==Home== This frog lives high on the tepui flatlands. It lives in large bromeliad plants, for example Brocchinia tatei. Scientists saw the frog between 1800 and 2700 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside Canaima National Park. ==Young== The male frog calls to the female frogs. The tadpoles swim in water in the bromeliad plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Most of the frogs live high on the tepui flatland, but people set fires lower down that can go that high. Climate change can also hurt this frog. There is nowhere higher and colder for them to climb to if the weather becomes too hot. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
