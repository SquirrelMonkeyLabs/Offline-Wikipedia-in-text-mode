His position is center. The Magic chose Howard with the first pick overall in the 2004 NBA Draft. Howard did not play college basketball. He entered the draft right out of high school. Howard is considered one of the greatest rebounders and defensive players in the history of basketball. He is the NBA's active leader in offensive rebounds, total rebounds and blocked shots. ==Career highlights== Howard has been chosen as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year three times, and won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 2008. Howard was also named to the All-NBA First Team three times, was an All-Star five times, and won a gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. From roughly 2008 to 2012, Howard was widely considered both the best rebounder, best defensive and center basketball player in the world, as highlighted by leading the league in rebounding almost every season and winning a league record three consecutive NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
