He was known as \"the dominant sprinter of the 1950s\" and \"the most relaxed sprinter of all time, even more so than his hero Jesse Owens\". He was born in Harlingen, Texas. He retired in 1958 to become a farmer and a woodworker. He made a short comeback before the 1960 Olympic Games, but failed to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team.
