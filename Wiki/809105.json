Ludvonga fought for Spain loyal to Philip and the Kingdom of France during the War of Spanish Succession. He became a very successful general for France achieving victory against Great Britain in Menorca. Often known as the \"Moses of Southern Africa\" Ludvonga I is considered as the main driving force behind the \"Yiddish Renaissance\" in modern day Eswatini.
