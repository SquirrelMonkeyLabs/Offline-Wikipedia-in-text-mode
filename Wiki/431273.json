 "text": "Egocentrism is a state of mind of putting oneself in the center of interest, of being interested more about oneself than about other people. ==Overview== While egocentrism is normal in young children, it becomes more and more of a problem, in older children, adolescents and adults. To egocentric people, self-relevant information is seen as more important in shaping one’s judgments than are thoughts about others and other-relevant information. ==Name== The term egocentrism was mostly coined by Piaget, a psychologist. Egocentrism is different from both egoism and narcissism. Young children are egocentric: they see themselves as the \"center\" of the world. Developing self-conscience requires the perception that there are others, that there is socialisation with other people, and that there are differences between oneself and other people. ==Characteristics== Those who are egocentric are often unable to fully understand or to cope with others' opinions. The fact that reality can be different from what they are ready to accept is difficult for them. ==Related pages== * Ego * Arrogance * Narcissism * Superiority bias * Dunning–Kruger effect * Fundamental attribution error * Haltlose personality disorder (HPD) * Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) ==References== Category:Psychology",
