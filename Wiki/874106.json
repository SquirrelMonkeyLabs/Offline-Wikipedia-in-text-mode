 "text": "Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (12 October 1881 â€“ 9 August 1942), commonly known as Edith Stein, is a Catholic saint and martyr. Stein was a Jew at birth but converted to Catholicism in 1922. Eleven years later, in 1933, she became a nun. She was a victim of the Holocaust; she was executed by Nazis in a gas chamber at Auschwitz in 1942. Stein was one of the most important philosophers on Earth during her adult life. Her work focused on phenomenology and the views of metaphysics held by Thomas Aquinas. After her death, she was honored by the Roman Catholic Church. On 1 May 1987, Pope John Paul II beatified Stein while visiting Cologne. About eleven years later, on 11 October 1998, Pope John Paul II canonized her. == Sources == Category:Christian saints Category:1891 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Holocaust victims",
