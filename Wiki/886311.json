 "text": "The third inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt as the 32nd president of the United States happened on January 20, 1941. It was the start of the third term of Franklin D. Roosevelt as president and the only term of Henry A. Wallace as vice president. A public ceremony happened on the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 39th presidential inauguration. This was the one and only time that a president has ever been sworn in to a third term in office. After the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1951, this meant that no person could be elected more than twice as president. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes administered the oath of office to Roosevelt. John Nance Garner administered the vice presidential oath of office to Wallace. ==References== ==Other websites== * Video of Roosevelt's Third Inaugural Address (Reel 1) (via YouTube) * Video of Roosevelt's Third Inaugural Address (Reel 2) (via YouTube) * Text of Roosevelt's Third Inaugural Address * Audio of Roosevelt's Third Inaugural Address (via YouTube) Category:1940s in the United States Category:Franklin D.
