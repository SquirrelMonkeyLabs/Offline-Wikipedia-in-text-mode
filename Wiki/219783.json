 "text": "The permanent way is the elements of railway lines: generally the pairs of rails typically laid on ties (\"sleepers\" in British parlance) embedded in ballast, intended to carry the ordinary trains of a railway. It is described as permanent way because in the earlier days of railway construction, contractors often laid a temporary track to transport spoil and materials about the site; when this work was substantially completed, the temporary track was taken up and the permanent way installed. == References == Category:Rail infrastructure",
