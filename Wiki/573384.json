 "text": "A Night to Remember is a 1958 British drama movie. The movie was adapted from Walter Lord's book of the same name. ==Plot== The RMS Titanic is christened for its maiden voyage. Passengers and crew get on board the ship. The ship departs from port on April 10, 1912 and heads out into sea. The ship receives a number of ice warnings from other ships. However, only a few of the messages are sent to Captain Edward J. Smith. The captain does not slow down the ship, or consider an alternate route. Late on Sunday, April 14, one of the lookouts sees an iceberg in front of the ship. Titanic turns hard to port and tries to avoid the iceberg. But the ship eventually hits the iceberg on its starboard side. The first five compartments, below the waterline, are ripped open. Thomas Andrews, the ship's maker, inspects the damage. He then learns the ship will sink within two hours. Making matters worse, the ship does not have enough lifeboats for all the people aboard. A distress signal is sent out. The radio operator on the RMS Carpathia hears the distress call, understands the emergency and alerts Captain Arthur Rostron. Rostron, right away, orders the Carpathia to head to the Titanic at full speed. But unfortunately, it will take four hours to reach the Titanic. Captain Smith orders Officers William Murdoch and Charles Lightoller to begin lowering the lifeboats. Women and children are let on the boats first. However, the women and children are not that happy about getting into the lifeboats. They are then forced into the boats by officers. The Carpathia is racing to the Titanic site. Before Carpathia can get there, though, Titanic sinks. On the Carpathia, Lightoller is told by Rostron that only 705 people have survived. They have only passed one body. ==Cast== * Kenneth More as Second Officer Charles Lightoller * Ronald Allen as Mr. Clarke (Mr. John Chapman) * Robert Ayers as Arthur Godfrey Peuchen * Honor Blackman as Mrs. Liz Lucas * Anthony Bushell as Captain Arthur Rostron * John Cairney as Mr. Murphy * Jill Dixon as Mrs. Clarke (Mrs. Sarah Chapman) * Jane Downs as Mrs. Sylvia Lightoller * James Dyrenforth as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV * Michael Goodliffe as shipbuilder Thomas Andrews * Kenneth Griffith as Wireless Operator Jack Phillips * Harriette Johns as Lady Richard (Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon) * Frank Lawton as J.
