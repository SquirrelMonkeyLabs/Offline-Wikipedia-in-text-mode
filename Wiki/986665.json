 "text": "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth (\"实践是检验真理的唯一标准\") is an article by Chinese intellectual Hu Fuming published in 1978 in the Chinese philosophy journal Theoretical Trends. In it Fuming advocated \"anti- dogmatism,\" and the development of new solutions to meet current economic and social problems. The article was influential within CCP inner circles, and was adopted specifically by Deng Xiaoping at the 1978 Party Plenum. While controversial in the early post-Mao era, with Deng's advocacy Practice became the ideological counterweight to the philosophy of Hua Guofeng's Two Whatevers and enabled Deng to surpass Hua in the struggle over party leadership. ==References== Category:Essays Category:1978 works Category:Chinese literature",
