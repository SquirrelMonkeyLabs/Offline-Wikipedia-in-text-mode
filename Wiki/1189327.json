India: Spectrum Publications, 2002. p. 6 In Meitei royal chronicle, she was nicknamed as \"Sicha Mayang Reima\". Mayang Reima is a title for any Meitei queen of Cachar. == Marriage == Princess Induprabha, daughter of King Modhuchandra of Manipur, was married to King Krishnachandra of Cachar around 1802 CE. Following the death of King Krishnachandra, his brother Govindchandra ascended the throne and married Induprabha without her consent. This action caused discontent among both the Manipuri royal family (Ningthouja dynasty) and the people of Cachar. Details of her wedding ceremony was recorded in the Meitei royal chronicle. The Cheitharon Kumpapa records the events as follows: According to Cheitharol Kumbaba 43 (4th ed., p.181), the Chief Minister of Cachar arrived with 275 men to deliver fish for the then future Queen of Cachar. == Contribution to cultural heritage == Queen Induprabha () played a notable role in the cultural and religious transformation of Cachar. She introduced Meitei Vaishnavism to the region and opposed the prevailing practice of animal sacrifice. She facilitated the performance of Ras Lila by bringing artists and instructors from Manipur, thereby promoting Meitei cultural heritage traditions in Cachar. Under the influence of her paternal family, King Krishnachandra of Cachar accepted the Vaishnavite form of Meitei Hinduism. In 1790, both Krishnachandra and his brother Govindchandra formally converted to Hinduism. Their people followed their example, and most of the Kacharis in the area also became Hindus. == Contribution to international relations == Induprabha contributed to the maintenance of diplomatic relations between Cachar and Manipur. She was also involved in the formation of the Manipur Levy force, organized by her relatives, Gambhir Singh and Nara Singh, aimed at liberating Manipur from Burmese occupation, better known as the Chahi Taret Khuntakpa (or Seven Years' Devastation). Induprabha had three important relatives: Gambhir Singh, Marjit Singh, and Sarjit Singh.Indigenous People of Barak Valley. N.P., 2020. Govindchandra, the king of Cachar, was weak. He had no real power or strong army, and people did not support him. He was known for running away during difficult times. The people of Cachar believed that their lives and property would be safer and the kingdom would improve if the stronger Manipuri princes took charge. With support from local leaders like Gulu Mia and Barjuram, Gambhir Singh attacked the capital of Cachar in 1818. Govindchandra ran away to North Cachar without a fight, and the Manipuri rulers took control of the Cachar plains. == British relations == After the death of King Krishnachandra, the British administration recognized Induprabha as the Queen of Cachar and granted her a monthly pension of Rs. 196 in 1856. == Legacy == In the novel Ladies in The Palace Trilogy - Ningthemnubee Trilogy, written by BM Maisnamba, Lady Induprava () is described as follows: Women’s College, Silchar, was renamed in honor of Kachari queen Rani Induprabha. The renaming recognizes her historical significance, particularly her contributions to the cultural and religious transformation of the Kachari kingdom and her role in maintaining diplomatic ties between Cachar and Manipur. == Related pages == * Ahom–Meitei relations ** Kuranganayani * Meitei people in Assam ** Meitei language in Assam * Meitei people in Tripura ** Meitei queens of Tripura * Burmese–Meitei relations ** Meitei–Shan relations ** Seven Years' Devastation ** Manipur Levy == References == Category:Meitei people Category:History of Manipur Category:Assam",
