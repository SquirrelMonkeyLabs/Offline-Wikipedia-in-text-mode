 "text": "\"Praying\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Kesha, for her third studio album, Rainbow. The song was written by Kesha along with Andrew Joslyn, Ben Abraham, and Ryan Lewis, known for his work with rapper Macklemore. The song is different from her other songs. Instead of having the dance-pop and electropop styles that Kesha is known for, \"Praying\" is a ballad. The lyrics talk about an abuser, and the main character states, \"I hope you're somewhere praying.\" Some critics have said that the song is directed towards Dr. Luke, Kesha's former producer and former owner of Kemosabe Records. The song entered the top 20 of the charts in Australia and Canada and the top 30 in the UK and US. == Music video == The video was directed by Jonas Ã…kerlund. == References == Category:Kesha songs Category:2017 songs",
