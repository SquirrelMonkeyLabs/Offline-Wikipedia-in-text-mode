He made many important discoveries on the shores of the Minas Basin and the Bay of Fundy in the 1940s. George found the world's smallest dinosaur tracks in 1984 near Parrsboro, Nova Scotia, Canada. His other finds include many fossilized amphibian and dinosaur prints that were displayed, along with the world's smallest dinosaur tracks, at his Parrsboro Rock and Mineral Shop and Museum. One of them is a 17-inch (45-cm) track that may have been made by a primitive, two-legged, crocodile-like creature that was nearly 20 feet (6 m) long. George's other discoveries include a fossilized insect with three pairs of wings and a tiny horseshoe crab that supplies a missing link in evolutionary history.Order of Nova Scotia, Recipients - 2013 George died on November 29, 2018 in Parrsboro at the age of 87. ==References== ==Other websites== *Order of Nova Scotia recipients - 2013 Category:1931 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Canadian scientists Category:Geologists Category:People from Nova Scotia",
