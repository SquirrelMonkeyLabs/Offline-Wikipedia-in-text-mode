The community members are descendants of Markandeya rishi. They engage as priests Brahmins for performing all rites and rituals and also perform services as temple Priests for other castes. ==Origin== The term Padmashali is derived from two words Padma and Shali, The Padma means lotus and Shali means weaver. They support their Sanskrit origin with various myths and Puranas such as Kulapurana and Markandeya Purana. The Padmashalis claim to be descendants from Bhrigu Rishi and Markandeya Rishi, Markandeya's son Bhavana Rishi who were born one hundred and one son; they took to weaving and the first clothes they wore was out of the fibres of the lotus stem so they came to be known as Padmashalis. ==Padmashalis Today== The Padmashalis divided into two groups based on Sampradaya, being the Shaivas and the Vaishnavas and they worship both Shiva and Vishnu. Although Padmashalis are related to Brahmins, they are considered as a backward (OBC) caste by the Indian government while forward caste in some states. The community is highly Sanskritised, with all men wearing the sacred thread and performing the similar rituals which north Indian Brahmins do, like North Indian Brahmin castes, their origin relates to sages as gothras. The Padmashalis basically perform Brahmin rites and even today a group who are qualified as agama shastra pandits perform the poojas and vedic rites. They are identified as Padma Brahmins. ==References== ==Other websites== * Padmashali Network, Global * Padmashali International Welfare Association, Vijayawada * POPA - Padmashali Officials and Professionals Association * World Padmashali Foundation * Padmashali Samaj Seva Sangh - an informational portal for Padmashalis * Karnataka Padmashali Sangha * Weavers Welfare Trust * Nirmal Padmashali Sanstha * Akhil Padmashali Samaj * Padmashali Graduates and Students Association *Telangana Padmashali Udyogula Sangam *North American Padmashali Association *Padmashali Category:Hindus Category:Ethnic groups in India",
