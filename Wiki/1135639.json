 "text": "Hyloxalus saltuarius is a frog. It lives in Colombia. Scientists saw this frog on the ground in forests on hills that have water in the air. Scientists saw this frog between 1200 and 2000 meters above sea level. They think its tadpoles swim in streams. Scientists have seen this frog in two protected parks: Parque Nacional Natural Cueva de los Gu√°charos and Parque Nacional Natural Cordillera Los Picachos. Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. They found many frogs in Parque Nacional Natural Cordillera Los Picachos in 2000. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
