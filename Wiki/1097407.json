 "text": "\"Red Sector A\" is a 1984 song by Canadian progressive rock band Rush and is the leading single from their 10th studio album Grace Under Pressure. It is based on the experiences of Holocaust survivors, particularly those in concentration camps. Lyricist Neil Peart stated that the song was inspired by Geddy Lee's mother's accounts of her time in the camps. While the lyrics are ambiguous enough to be interpreted as a prison camp in any setting, the detailed imagery and themes evoke the horrors of the Holocaust. ==Track listing== == References == Category:1984 songs Category:Rush (band) songs Category:Progressive rock songs Category:Synth rock songs",
