It belongs to the Northern Sindhi group. Saraiki is native to northern Sindh, while it is also spoken in parts of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan; as well as by partition migrants and their descendants in India. It is sometimes claimed to be a language, although it lacks certain traits to be referred to as a distinct language, and is widely recognized as a variety of Northern Sindhi. == Etymology == The word Saraiki is probably derived from the Sindhi word Siraiki for its own dialect, which means dialect of Sero/Siro (SauvÄ«ra) region in ancient Sindh. today the name of Siraiki dialect of Sindhi is changed to Siroli/Sireli to not create confusion. == National day of Sindhi == National day of Sindhi language and Sindhi culture is celebrated ==References== Category:Indo-Aryan languages Category:Languages of Balochistan (Pakistan) Category:Languages of Sindh Category:Languages of India Category:Languages of Punjab (Pakistan) Category:Languages of Azad Jammu and Kashmir",
