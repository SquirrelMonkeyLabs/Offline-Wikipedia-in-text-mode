 "text": "\"Found Someone\" is the second single from Norwegian singer - songwriter Marion Raven's third studio album, Nevermore. The single was officially released on December 6, 2010, on the Norwegian iTunes Store. It was later performed live on the Norwegian finale of The X Factor on December 11, where Raven was serving as a judge and mentor. The single was very well received on Norwegian radio, reaching number 4 on the charts and staying on for several weeks, unlike the previous single \"Flesh and Bone\" which was harshly criticized. Found Someone was recorded twice, once in Los Angeles in a solo piano version and the second time in Norway, but this time different sounds such as violins were added. The second version was the one released as a single in Norway, and the first version is not available as it was included on the unreleased Nevermore album.",
