 "text": "1966 Nigerian coup d'etat was a bloody military coup that took place in Nigeria on 15 January 1966 and it caused the deaths of several political figures in the country, including Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa (the Prime Minister), Sir Ahmadu Bello (the Sarduana of Sokoto and Premier of the old Northern Region), Chief S. L. Akintola (the Premier of the old Western Region) and Chief Festus Okotie-Eboh (the Minister of Finance). According to Femi Fani-Kayode, Nigeria's first military coup in the early hours of 15 January 1966 was \"a bloody, vicious, merciless, unrelenting and violent mutiny\". According to Isaiah Ogedegbe, the coup on 15 January 1966 and another counter- coup later that year seemed to have led to the Nigerian Civil War, which he also described as \"an excruciating experience for us as a nation\". On the 58th anniversary of the 1966 Nigerian coup d'etat, he also begged the President of Nigeria, the person of Bola Tinubu to kindly meet Nigeria's needs for better policing, continued democracy and restructuring. ==References== Category:Civil wars involving Africa Category:20th century in Nigeria Category:History of Nigeria Category:1960s conflicts Category:1970s conflicts Nigerian coup d'état",
