 "text": "The term compound fruit is sometimes used when it is not clear which of several fruit types a fruit belongs to. A compound fruit is \"composed of two or more similar parts\". A compound fruit may be: * An aggregate fruit, in which one flower contains several separate ovaries, which grow together during development. * A multiple fruit, in which several flowers, each with an ovary, develop into small fruits that grow together into a larger fruit. * A simple fruit formed from a compound ovary. Grapes grow in clusters, but are not compound fruits. Each grape is grown from one ovary in one flower, and they are not attached to one another. ==References== Category:Fruits",
