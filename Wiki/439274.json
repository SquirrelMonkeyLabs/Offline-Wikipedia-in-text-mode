 "text": "Sir George Everest (; 4 July 1790 - 1 December 1866) was a Welsh surveyor and geographer. He was the Surveyor General of India from 1830 through 1843. Everest was born on 4 July 1790 in Gwernvale Manor, just west of Crickhowell in Powys. He was baptised in Greenwich. He was largely responsible for completing the section of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India along the meridian arc from southern India extending north to Nepal, a distance of about . This survey was started by William Lambton in 1806 and it lasted for several decades. In 1865, Mount Everest was named in his honour despite his objections by the Royal Geographical Society. This enormous peak was surveyed by Everest's successor, Andrew Scott Waugh, in his role as the Surveyor-General of India. Everest died on 1 December 1866 in London, England. He was 76. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1790 births Category:1866 deaths Category:British explorers Category:British geographers Category:Cartographers Category:Welsh people",
