 "text": "The canyon tree frog, Arizona tree frog, Sonoran tree toad, ca√±on tree toad, or Cope's hyla (Dryophytes arenicolor) is a frog that lives in Mexico and the United States. This frog lives in marshes and cloud forests. Scientists have found this frog in meadows full of water with no trees in them. The adult frog is 3.2 to 5.7 cm long from nose to rear end. This frog eats many kinds of insects. This frog is not endangered but there are fewer in the wild than there were. This is because human beings catch them. This frog is easy to catch while it is sitting in the sun on rocks. Human beings use this frog in scientific experiments. This frog is good for experiments about how animals stay warm. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
