 "text": "Yushan (), also called Mount Jade and Mount Yu is a mountain in Taiwan. It is the tallest mountain in Taiwan because it is above sea level. The mountain used to be called Mount Morrison, but it isn't called that anymore. That name was named after Robert Morrison, who is a missionary. The mountain is usually called Yushan or Mount Jade. In the winter, the top of Yushan usually has a lot of thick snow. The snow makes the top shine like jade. That is why it is called Mount Jade. Yushan and all the mountains around it are part of the Yushan Range of mountains. The Yushan Range is in Yushan National Park. The area has the largest amount of natural space that has not been developed. It has a lot of forests and many types of animals. ==References== Category:Mountains of Asia Category:Geography of Taiwan",
