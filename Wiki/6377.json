His name comes from the Nahuatl word Motecuhzoma, which means \"he who is leader because of his fury\". In Spanish, he is called Moctezuma. == Arrival of Cortés == Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in Mesoamerica in 1519 and invaded the Aztec Empire. Instead of seeing Cortés as a threat, Moctezuma thought Cortés was the god Quetzalcoatl and did not fight back. The Spanish took control of the empire's capital city, Tenochtitlan, in 1520. Cortés took Moctezuma prisoner. When the Aztec people resisted, Cortés told Moctezuma to calm them down. While doing that, Moctezuma was killed. === Death === Historians do not know exactly how Moctezuma died. The Spaniards said he was killed by Aztec people who threw rocks at him. Meanwhile, the Aztecs said Cortés killed Moctezuma. They said they found Moctezuma's body in the streets with many sword wounds after the Spanish left. == Other websites == *A reconstructed portrait of Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin, based on historical sources, in a contemporary style.
