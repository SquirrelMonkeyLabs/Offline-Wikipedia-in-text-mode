 "text": "Philip II was an ancient king of Macedonia. He ruled from 359 BC to 336 BC. He was the father of the emperor Alexander the Great, who was born in 356 BC. Philip united all of Ancient Greece. He would either bring a city-state into his hegemony with his military or he would talk/bribe the leaders into joining his empire. It was under his reign in 338 BC at Chaeronea against Athens that Alexander first showed his military genius. Philip was assassinated by one of his bodyguards, at the celebration of the wedding of his daughter. Alexander soon carried out Philip's plan to attack the Persian Empire.
