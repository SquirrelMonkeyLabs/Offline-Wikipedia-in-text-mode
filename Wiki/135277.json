 "text": "The Wheel of Time is a long running fantasy series of novels written by American author Robert Jordan. The first in the series, The Eye of the World was published in 1990, and the last, A Memory of Light, was published in 2009. Jordan died while he was writing the last book, so it was finished by Brandon Sanderson. A Memory of Light was split into three parts as the book length was too long. == Books == * The Eye of the World * The Great Hunt * The Dragon Reborn * The Shadow Rising * The Fires of Heaven * Lord of Chaos * A Crown of Swords * The Path of Daggers * Winter's Heart * Crossroads of Twilight * Knife of Dreams *Gathering Storm (The first part of A Memory of Light) *Towers of Midnight (The second part of A Memory of Light) *A Memory of Light (The last part of A Memory of Light) == References == Category:American fantasy books Category:Series of books",
