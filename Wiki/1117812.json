 "text": "Husam ad-Din Lu'lu' (died 1200) was a notable Mamluk commander during Saladin's era. ==Biography== An admiral of Armenian origin, Lu'lu' began his military career in the Fatimid army. Under the Ayyubid dynasty, he served as hajib, and was later appointed by Al-Adil I to lead the Ayyubid fleet, which was manned by sailors from North Africa. His primary mission was to counter Crusader raids on the Red Sea region starting in 1182. Lu'lu' successfully broke the blockade of Ile de Gray, defeating two ships belonging to Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, and reclaimed Aila. Subsequently, he led the Muslim fleet down the Red Sea, where they surprised and routed Frankish ships anchored near al-Hawra and Rabigh. The raiders abandoned their vessels and fled into the Arabian desert, pursued by Lu'lu's forces for five days, resulting in the capture of nearly all the enemy raiders. Later, commanding a Muslim navy of 50 ships, Lu'lu' participated in the siege of Acre, capturing two large Crusader vessels laden with plunder, as recorded by Abu Shama. Following this, he was entrusted by Al-Mu'azzam Isa with overseeing the fortress at Mount Tabor. Husam ad-Din Lu'lu' died on 9 Jumada al-Thani AH 596 (AD 1200). ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:1200 deaths Category:Egyptian military people Category:Year of birth missing",
