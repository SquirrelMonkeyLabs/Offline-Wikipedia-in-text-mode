 "text": "A drug lord, also called a drug kingpin is a criminal boss who controls a sizable network of the people involved in the illegal drug trade. Such people are often hard to bring to justice, for they are not usually in possession of something illegal. Examples of drug lords are Pablo Escobar, Griselda Blanco, Frank Lucas, Joaquín Guzmán and Manuel Noriega. Drug lords have started breaking the larger drug cartels into much smaller groups. With newer technology, drug lords are able to manage their business better from behind the scenes. They usually keep themselves off the FBI and DEA lists. The smaller drug cartels are proving to be safer and make more money for those involved. ==References== Category:Organized crime Category:Drug traffickers",
