She was part of the gold medal-winning team dubbed the \"Final Five\" at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. She also won the bronze medal for the balance beam during the Olympics. Biles is a three-time world all- around champion (2013–15), three-time world floor champion (2013–15), two-time world balance beam champion (2014, 2015), four-time United States national all-around champion (2013–16), and a member of the gold medal-winning American teams at the 2014 and 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Having won a combined total of 37 Olympic and World Championship medals, Biles is the most decorated American gymnast. She took this over from Shannon Miller, who had held this record since 1996. With her win in Rio, Biles became the sixth woman to have won an individual all-around title at both the World Championships and the Olympic Games. With four Olympic gold medals, Biles set a new American record for most gold medals in women’s gymnastics at a single game. On April 22, 2023, she married American football player Jonathan Owens. == References == Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States Category:BBC 100 Women Category:American gymnasts Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2020 Summer Olympics Category:2024 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Texas Category:American adoptees",
