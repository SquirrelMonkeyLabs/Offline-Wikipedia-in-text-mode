His works on medicine and psychiatry brought him to study the history of melancholia (notably in the Trois Fureurs, 1974). He was the first scholar to publish work (in 1964) on Ferdinand de Saussure's study of anagrams. Starobinski was a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. He was elected a member of the Academia Europaea in 1988. Starobinski died on 4 March 2019 in Morges, Switzerland, aged 98.Décès du critique littéraire et psychiatre genevois Jean Starobinski Jean Starobinski, historien des idées, est mort ==References== ==Other websites== * Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques (in French) * Société Jean-Jacques Rousseau (in French) * Video Starobinski, Jean (in French) Category:1920 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Writers from Geneva Category:Literary critics Category:Members of Academia Europaea",
