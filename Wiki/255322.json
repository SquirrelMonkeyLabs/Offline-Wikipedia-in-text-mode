He is known by his work in the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment. Fatu is a member of the huge Samoan Anoa'i wrestling family and the nephew of the Wild Samoans, Afa and Sika, who trained him in the 1980s. He is the brother of the late Eddie Fatu, better known as Umaga, and The Tonga Kid, who was part of The Islanders, a tag team with Haku in the WWF. Fatu teamed with his cousin Samu, the son of Afa, as The Samoan Swat Team. The Swat Team wrestled mainly in the south, winning titles in the World Class Wrestling Association in Dallas. The team later worked for the World Wrestling Federation as the Headshrinkers before Fatu went on a singles career. He also was a member of the stable Too Cool during the Attitude Era. Three of his sons now wrestle in WWE: His twin sons Jonathan and Joshua are famous as Jimmy and Jey Uso, together known as The Usos, while their younger brother Joseph is wrestling under the ring name Solo Sikoa.
