 "text": "Corsican ( or Lingua Corsa) is a Romance language spoken on the island of Corsica (France), together with French, which is the official language. Similar languages are also spoken on the nearby island of Sardinia (Italy), in the city of Sassari and the historical region of Gallura. Corsican is similar to the dialects of Central Italy, particularly in Tuscany. Corsican is spoken by almost 35% of people in Corsica. According to its UNESCO classification, the Corsican language is now in danger of becoming extinct. The language is separated into two dialects, \"Northern Corsican\", spoken in the Bastia and Corte areas, and \"Southern Corsican\", spoken around Sartene and Porto-Vecchio. The dialect of Ajaccio has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at Calvi and Bonifacio are like the Genoa dialect, also known as Ligurian. In the Sardinian region of Gallura, including the town of Tempio Pausania, and on the island of La Maddalena \"Gallurese\" is spoken. The Corsican language is very important for the Corsican culture, because it is really rich in proverbs. == Alphabet == Majuscule Forms A B C CHJ D E F G GHJ H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V Z Minuscule Forms a b c chj d e f g ghj h i j l m n o p q r s t u v z Names a bi ci chji dè è èffè gi ghjè acca i ji èllè èmmè ènnè o pè cu èrrè èssè ti u vè zèda ==References== == Other websites == * Wikiquote: Corsican proverbs Category:Languages of France Category:Languages of Italy Category:Romance languages Category:Corsica",
