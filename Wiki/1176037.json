 "text": "A Galactic disc (or Galactic disk) is a part of disc galaxies, such as spiral galaxies and the lenticular galaxies, like the Milky Way and the NGC 4526. Galactic discs are made of a stellar part (made up most of galaxies stars) and a gaseous part (mostly made up of cold gas and dust). The stellar population of galactic discs has a very little motion with a lot of stars having nearly circular orbits. Galactic discs can be thin beacause the disc material's motion lies on the plane of the disc. For example: The Milky Way's disc is 1 kilolight-year thick but thickness can be diffrent on the other galaxies. Category:Outer space",
