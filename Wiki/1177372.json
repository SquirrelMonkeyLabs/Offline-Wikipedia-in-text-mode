 "text": "Sede vacante is a term in Catholic canon law that means \"the seat being empty.\" It is used when a diocese or archdiocese has no prelate in office. This often happens when a Pope dies or resigns. During this time, the Holy See is run by the Camerlengo and cardinals. In the Diocese of Rome, the empty seat is the cathedra of Saint John Lateran, the main church of the Bishop of Rome. == Related pages == * Papal conclave * Camerlengo (Catholic Church) == Notes == == References == == Other websites == Category:Vatican City Category:Roman Catholicism",
