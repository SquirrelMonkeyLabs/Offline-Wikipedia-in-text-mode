 "text": "Jimmy Two-Shoes (also known as Jimmy Cool in most parts of Europe) is a Disney animated television series produced by Breakthrough Entertainment, Mercury Filmworks and Elliott Animation that aired on Toon Disney/Disney XD in the United States and Teletoon in Canada. The series centers on the exploits of the happy-go-lucky title character, who lives in Miseryville, a miserable town filled with monsters and demon-like creatures. The series was created by Edward Kay and Sean Scott. == Premise == The series follows the adventures of Jimmy, a happy-go-lucky boy who makes it his mission to find fun everywhere he goes. This is a challenge because Jimmy lives in Miseryville, the unhappiest town around, run by the megalomaniacal Lucius Heinous the Seventh. Miseryville has one main industry: Misery Inc., purveyors of putrid products guaranteed to cause grief; and they do not come with a money-back guarantee. Along with his best friends Heloise (part-time genius, full-time soul-crusher who is secretly in love with Jimmy) and Beezy (adventure lover, couch potato, and Jimmy's definitive best friend), Jimmy is determined to surf past all obstacles and bring his infectious enthusiasm to the whole town. == Characters == === Main characters === * Jimmy Two-Shoes: The protagonist of the series, Jimmy is a 14-year-old boy known for his boundless optimism and thrill-seeking nature. He is determined to spread happiness in Miseryville, often clashing with its ruler, Lucius Heinous VII. * Beezy J. Heinous: Jimmy's best friend and the son of Lucius Heinous VII. Beezy is characterized by his laziness and self- centeredness but remains loyal to Jimmy. * Heloise: Another close friend of Jimmy, Heloise is a brilliant inventor with a sadistic side. She harbors a secret crush on Jimmy and often expresses her feelings through her actions. === Supporting characters === * Lucius Heinous VII: The ruler of Miseryville, Lucius is often at odds with Jimmy due to his attempts to bring joy to the town. Lucius is bitter and prefers to keep Miseryville as it is. == Episodes == === Season 1 (2008-2009) === # I Totally Shredded My Cheese / Heloise's Wish List (December 1, 2008) # Pop-Sicles / Chez Beezy (December 8, 2008) # SpewTube / Monster Mutt (December 15, 2008) # A Cold Day in Miseryville / Mount Misery (December 22, 2008) # Heat Blanket Jimmy / Cellphone-itis (December 29, 2008) # Power Squid and Spaghetti Beezy / The Big Date (March 2, 2009) # Carnival Lucius / Baby Boom (March 9, 2009) # Way Below Par / Jimmy Matchmaker (March 16, 2009) # The Competition / Jimmy, Don't Be a Hero (March 23, 2009) # A Hair-Brained Idea / Ghost Smackers (March 30, 2009) # Jimmy Gets a Stache / The Butley Did It (May 14, 2009) # The Product Tester / Invasion of the Weavils (May 21, 2009) # Catalouge of Misery / Bend It Like Werckem (May 28, 2009) # Wish You Weren't Here / Cerbee in Love (June 4, 2009) # The Racing Bug / Too Many Jimmys (June 11, 2009) # Rear Pickle / Clowns Gone Wild (June 18, 2009) # The Masked Jackhammer / The Big Drip (June 25, 2009) # Best Prank Ever / Bad Horn Day (July 2, 2009) # Night in the Heinous Museum / I Married a Weavil (July 9, 2009) # Meet the Gnomans / There's Always a Hiccup (July 16, 2009) # I Am Jimmy / Happy Birthday, Lucius (October 8, 2009) # Fused Together / Bus Driving BFF (October 15, 2009) # Rocket Jimmy / Pet Rocky (October 22, 2009) # No Rules, Rulez Jimmy / Best Bud Battle (October 29, 2009) # Heloise's Big Secret / Jimmy in the Big House (November 5, 2009) # Scent of a Heinous / There Will be Chocolate (November 12, 2009) === Season 2 (2010-2011) === # Dance, Jimmy, Dance / Jimmy and Beezy on the Run (September 2, 2010) # Beezy J.
