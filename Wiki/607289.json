World Entertainment News Network (England). August 10, 2017. Åhr died on November 15, 2017 before a concert in Tucson, Arizona of a supposed Xanax overdose at the age of 21. After an autopsy was completed, it was confirmed that he was given fentanyl instead of Xanax. Åhr's mother Liza Womack filed wrongful death charges against his label, FAE grp.
