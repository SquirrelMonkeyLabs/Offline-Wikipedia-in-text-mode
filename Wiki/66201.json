 "text": "Reproduction is to create or recreate something, (usually) a new living thing, such as a baby. In biology, the two types of reproduction are sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves two organisms of the same species, each supplying half the genes for the descendant. Asexual reproduction only involves a single organism; it works by division (or splitting) of the cell. Most bacteria reproduce by asexual reproduction. Some organisms can either reproduce sexually or asexually.",
