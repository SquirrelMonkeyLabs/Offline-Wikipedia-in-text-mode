(1997). The art of looking in Hitchcock's Rear window. New York: Limelight Editions. This is when someone intimately watches someone else. In the film, Jeff is spying on his neighbors. This act is morally questionable, and the audience participates in it. The camera follows Jeff's eyes. It switches back to facing Jeff. The camera allows the viewers to join Jeff in his actions. The audience should feel guilty. Stella criticizes Jeff's actions. She says that people should stop looking out and look at themselves. Lisa says Jeff's actions are like a disease. She is upset that Jeff only watches the neighbors. Jeff himself questions if it is alright to spy on a man with binoculars. Lisa and Stella question Jeff's actions at first, but they join him later. The idea of spying can relate to surveillance in the state. During the time, people feared that the government would watch them the whole time. This fear was due to McCarthyism.A Hitchcock Reader. (2009). United Kingdom: Wiley, p. 208. In the film, a helicopter comes close above the village. It is like the helicopter is spying on the village. There is almost no difference between private and public in the film. === Loneliness === Another theme is loneliness and isolation. All the residents are separated from each other. They are like prisoners in their own apartments. Jeff cannot leave the apartment with his injury. The entire film is also limited to the space of the courtyard. The character Miss Lonelyhearts can represent the isolation of the neighbors. Jeff is detached from the neighbors as he watches them, and they do not know he is watching them. Jeff is like a photographer, taking mental pictures of his neighbors. The dog owner says that none of the people know the meaning of a neighbor and that they do not care.Fawell, J. (2004). Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film. United States: Southern Illinois University Press, p. 12-14, 48, 85, 116-122. === Gender and Marriage === Gender roles are important in the film. It is after World War II and women were changing roles in society. In the film, male characters are no longer heroes. Hitchcock switches the roles of men and women.Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. (2000). United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, p. 68, 76. For instance, Thorwald murders his wife. Jeff is injured, his camera is destroyed, and he cannot walk. Detective Doyle cannot find evidence. Meanwhile, Lisa and Stella are the only ones who can investigate. Gender roles connect to marriage. Jeff talks about marriage on the phone. He analyzes Lisa a lot and is not ready to marry her. At one point, Jeff and Lisa argue. Jeff thinks that Lisa could not stand Jeff's lifestyle as a photographer. Stella says that people in the past just fell in love and that now they study each other like samples in a bottle. This type of marriage connects to the other themes of loneliness and surveillance. The couples are not just loving each other, but objectively studying each other. They are distant from each other and must constantly watch each other. Jeff, for example, watches Lisa. Marriage appears in other places. There is a newly married couple. Lisa gets the wedding ring of Thorwald's wife. The wedding ring is symbolic for marriage and is a form of situational irony. Lisa wants to marry Jeff, but she ends up with the wedding ring of Thorwald's wife.Fawell, J. (2004). Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film. United States: Southern Illinois University Press, p. 23-24. == Production == === Development === The screenplay of Rear Window is based on the short story It Had To Be Murder. Cornell Woolrich wrote the story in 1942. The main story about a man in a wheelchair watching neighbors and thinking there is a murder is the same. Hitchcock added characters such as Lisa and Stella. There was no romantic relationship in the story. In the film, there are also more neighbors.\"Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic\". DVD Documentary, 1982. Two real murders inspired the film. The first is the \"case of Dr. Crippen.\" Dr. Crippen buried his wife in his basement in 1910. He made the mistake of letting his secretary wear his wife's jewelry. In the second case, Patrick Mahon murdered Emily Kaye in 1924. He did this by cutting her up and throwing her parts out of a train window. The man later burned her head in a fireplace.Truffaut, F. (2015). Hitchcock. United Kingdom: Simon & Schuster, p. 222. === Filming === The entire movie was shot at Paramount Studios. There was a complete set of Greenwich Village. It was one of the largest sets at Paramount. The set had a special drainage system and lighting for different parts of the day. There were 31 apartments on the set and 12 had full furniture.Bernhard Jendricke: Alfred Hitchcock. 1993, , p. 97. === Costume Design === Edith Head was the costume designer for the movie. Costumes and clothing are important in the film for characterization. Grace Kelly is into fashion and has many different outfits. The different clothes relate to changes in the roles of the characters. For instance, when Lisa and Stella help Jeff to investigate they we are wearing simple day dresses.3\\. \"The Dresses Had Told Me\": Fashion & Femininity in Rear Window. Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. (2000). United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, p. 91-105 === Music === Frank Waxman composed the score including the Piano song \"Lisa\". The film has mainly diegetic sounds. These are sounds that the characters in the film hear.\"Rear Window Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a Hitchcock Classic\". DVD Documentary, 1982. Natural sounds were used that would get louder or softer with distance. There are several songs including \"To See You Is to Love You\" by Bing Crosby, songs by Nat King Cole (\"Mona Lisa\", 1950) and Dean Martin (\"That's Amore\", 1952), Richard Rodgers' song \"Lover\" (1932), and \"M'appari tutt'amor\" from Friedrich von Flotow's opera Martha (1844), and part of Leonard Bernstein's music for the ballet Fancy Free (1944). == Reception == === Box Office === The film was a box office success.
