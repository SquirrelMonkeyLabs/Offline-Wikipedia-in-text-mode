 "text": "Elverhøy Church is a parish church of the Church of Norway. It is in Tromsø Municipality in Norway. The current church building was built in 1974. The original church, then known as Tromsø Church, was built in 1803 where Tromsø Cathedral is today. It served as the election church in 1814 for the city of Tromsø during Norway's first national elections. In 1861, the old church was dismantled and moved to a new location outside the city. It was eventually closed, dismantled, and moved again before being reopened as Elverhøy Church in its present location. The church now has a red, wooden exterior with a large steeple over the main entrance, and it can seat about 435 people. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Troms Category:Churches in Tromsø",
