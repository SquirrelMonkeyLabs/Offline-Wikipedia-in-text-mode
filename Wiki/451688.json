After the sale, they built new animal enclosures, a miniature train ride, a picnic park, more landscaping, a remodeled entrance, more parking spaces, informational and educational programs and activities. Ownership changed in 1999 and the zoo was renamed Greater Vancouver Zoo. The new owners focused on conservation and improving their educational programs. On May 31, 2006, formal charges were laid against the zoo by the Crown Counsel of British Columbia, in accordance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act because they failed to provide acceptable facilities for a baby hippo named \"Hazina\" that they acquired in October 2004.

The zoo lost its Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums accreditation for two years before regaining it back in 2012. ==Gallery== Image:VancouverIslandWolf.JPG|Vancouver Island Wolf at the Greater Vancouver Zoo.
