It takes about 40 seconds to work. ==Dangers== Some people use propofol for fun. If they use it a lot they can become addicted. In 2009, the American pop musician Michael Jackson was killed by an overdose of propofol. The propofol was given to Jackson by his doctor Conrad Murray. Murray was sentenced to four years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter of Jackson. This made the public more aware of the dangers of the drug.
