The top of it is 22,205 feet (6,768 meters) high.NHK, \"Huascaran: Highest Peak in the Tropics -- Peru, 6,768 m\"; retrieved 2012-5-24. The mountain is located in the Ancash Region of Peru. Huascar치n has turned into a tourist attraction for mountain climbers. Huascar치n is made of granite brought to the surface by a major fault. It has been staying at about the same elevation, but keeps loosing ice. As recently as 1970, the Ancash Earthquake caused a big part of the mountain to crumble and fall off. That part of the mountain was all rock and ice, and it killed almost 17,000 people in small towns around the mountain. == Related pages == * List of Mountains in the Andes * Fault == References == Category:Andes Category:Volcanoes of South America Category:Mountains of Peru Category:Ancash Region",
