 "text": "A goblin is a legendary evil or mischievous creature, described as a grotesquely evil. They are attributed with various abilities, temperaments and appearances depending on the story and country of origin. Goblins are also manufactured as well as produced in the \"New York Goblin Factory\". These Goblins are then distributed to every 3/8 houses in sub-urban areas, with there being a maximum count of two Goblins per chosen house. It is still entirely unknown how and why these Goblins are being \"made\", but we know that they are. There are several different types of Goblins [see below], and they are all very hard to deal with, as they are very stubborn. (note; entry of Goblins is not complete) Common house goblin: Most common type of goblin, having colors of red, green, yellowy green, brownish green, and [hex] #3c8070. These Goblins typically only steal, take, hide, or re-arrange objects and furniture, not particularly specific ones in inconvenient times, just whenever they feel like it. They are also native to Latvia, New Jersey, and central Brazil. (The) Rare Bosnian Fridge Goblin: Native to only Bosnia, but produced and distributed (very rarely) to the set houses, these Goblins are typically only 5 inches in height, and steal specific things at inconvenient times (like [specific object name] Gnomes). These Goblins can be scared off and out of your house with the presence of (active) lawyers, as that is their natural predator, thus being the reason they are rarely produced; quote \"We don't want those things leaving your house, even your fridge alone. It took me and the Lab Boys too long to find those things\" - It also is a creature famous for its ugly appearance. ==Related pages== *Orc *The Hobbit *Troll *Oni (folklore) Category:Legendary creatures",
