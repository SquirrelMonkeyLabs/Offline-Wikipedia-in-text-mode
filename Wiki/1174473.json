 "text": "Megarachne is an extinct genus of giant eurypterids from the Pennsylvanian period. It is often misunderstood as a spider because Megarachne means \"great spider\". == Description == === Size === Megarachne was a large sea scorpion, however other species were bigger, such as Hibbertopterus, which can reach more than 1.5 m (59 in). === Appearance === Megarachne had blade-like things on its limbs to do a feeding method called \"sweep-feeding\" and a second abdomen (opisthosoma) that doesn't have a known function. == Gallery == File:Outdated Megarachne.jpg|Outdated Megarachne reconstructed as a big spider at the Natural History Museum of Geneva File:20210116 Megarachne hypothetical reconstruction.png|A megarachne reconstruction based on fossils == Related pages == * Jaekelopterus * Eurypterus * Mycterops * Woodwardopterus * Hibbertopterus * Drepanopterus ==References== Category:Chelicerata Category:Animals of South America Category:Carboniferous",
