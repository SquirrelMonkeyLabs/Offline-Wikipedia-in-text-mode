According to the traditional account, he miraculously survived this injury for a year. This story has been passed down through a portrait painted by an unknown German painter. As of February 2022, the portrait was on display in the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle in Innsbruck, Austria. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2023 Category:16th-century births Category:16th-century deaths Category:Hungarian nobility",
