They are one of the few British groups of the early 1960s, along with the Rolling Stones, that have never disbanded and continue to record and perform. The Hollies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.The band's lineup in the Hall of Fame includes only the seven band members from 1964 through 1971. The most famous member during this time was Graham Nash, who went on to form the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young supergroup in the US.
