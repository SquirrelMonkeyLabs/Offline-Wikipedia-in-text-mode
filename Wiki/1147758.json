However, Qutulu Khan died before he could fight Man Singh. His son, Nisar Khan, initially resisted but then surrendered and was allowed to remain as governor. Two years later, Nisar Khan broke the agreement, took control of the crown lands in Puri (including the Jagannath temple), and rebelled. Man Singh defeated Nisar Khan, expelled him, and made Orissa part of the Bengal province in the Mughal Empire. ==Battle== In 1590, Qutlu Khan Lohani, an officer under Daud, the Sultan of Bengal, declared his independence and adopted the title of \"Qutlu Shah.\" In response, Raja Man Singh, the Mughal governor of Bihar, launched an expedition against him. However, before Man Singh could engage him, Qutlu Shah died. His son, Nasir Khan, quickly submitted to Mughal authority, paying homage to Man Singh on 15 August 1590. Nasir Khan was then appointed as the governor of Odisha and signed a treaty that ceded the region around Puri to the Mughals. For the next two years, Nasir Khan remained loyal to the Mughal Empire, but he soon violated the treaty by laying siege to the Jagannath Temple in Puri. In retaliation, Man Singh launched an attack and decisively defeated Nasir Khan in a battle near the modern-day town of Midnapore on 18 April 1592. By 1593, Odisha was fully incorporated into the Mughal Empire as part of the Bengal Subah. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:India",
