Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts are often also regarded as \"eastern Ukraine\" Almost a third of the country's population lives in the region, which includes several cities with population of around a million. Within Ukraine, the region is the most highly populated, particularly portions of central Kharkiv Oblast, south- western Luhansk Oblast, central, northern and eastern areas of Donetsk Oblast. The majority of the area is currently occupied by Russia due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ==References== Category:Geography of Ukraine",
