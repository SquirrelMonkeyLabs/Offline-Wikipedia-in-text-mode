 "text": "Igbudu Market is a local street market along Warri Sapele Road, Warri, Delta State, Nigeria. It is the biggest market in Delta State, Nigeria. One of the streets in Igbudu Market is called Hausa Quarters. Igbudu Market was named after Igbudu Community of the Agbassa Kingdom. The market started its operations after the Nigerian Civil War was fought in Nigeria and emerged as \"one of the most important Warri markets in Delta State\", because they sell and buy food in large quantities (both retail and wholesale), including grocery sales and purchases, as well as cosmetics and beauty products. The market has been described as \"the economic backbone of Warri\". Igbudu Market is also known for its marketplace preaching. According to Isaiah Ogedegbe, \"The preachers are in all corners of the marketplace, with the very religious women singing and dancing with them\". ==Fire incidents== Igbudu Market had experienced two separate fire incidents resulting in the loss of goods worth millions of naira, within the space of one month in July 2020, and also in August 2020. In May 2023, another fire incident happened at Igbudu Market, and one of the victims of that fire incident was reported to have fainted upon seeing the level of damage done to the victim's shop. The fire incident not only saw sympathy from the Delta State Government, but also got help from the Federal Government through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). About 30 victims of the fire incident were reported to have received some building materials and foodstuff items from the Federal Government. ==Closures of the market== On 30 March 2020, two days ahead of Ifeanyi Okowa's total lockdown of every market in Delta State, the Warri South Council Chairman Dr. Michael Tidi was reported to have shut down Igbudu Market in a bid \"to control the spread of the dreaded coronavirus\". However, Tidi's closure of the market was seen as having \"ethnic undertone\", an allegation that he strongly denied. Tidi said that the reason why he shut down the market two days earlier, was because the people did not comply with the Government's advice on social distancing. ==Composition== Igbudu Market is considered as a multicultural market, where people of every tribe is represented from the Urhobos, the Isokos, the Ijaws, the Itsekiris, the Fulanis and the Hausas. As they trade together, the Nigerian Pidgin English is mostly used by them so as \"to understand each other\". Igbudu Market is under the control of the Warri South Local Government. The market operates every day of the year, except it is complying with Government's orders or for traditional reasons. It daily attracts a large crowd of customers from every nook and cranny of Delta State and, according to Isaiah Ogedegbe, \"The struggle through the crowd as well as the noise add to the fun\". There is usually a great boost in trading activities in the market on every Saturday, \"as it is one of the busiest days due to the rush for 'second-hand' clothings locally known as 'gbogbo'.\" It is one of the markets in the country that is \"well known for the sale of the fairly used items\", also locally known as 'okrika', 'tokunbo' or 'bend down select'. ==References== ==External link== * Official Website ==Further reading== * Category:Delta State Category:Street markets",
