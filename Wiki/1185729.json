 "text": "The Lotus 20 was a Formula Junior car built by the Lotus team for the 1962 season as a successor to the Lotus 18. The chassis was covered with fiberglass. It had a double wishbone suspension, and the rear had a lower fork and a fixed length driveshaft and was consequently used as a high link. Compared to the Lotus 18, the 20 had a much smaller frontal area and a lower centre of gravity, helped by the fact that the driving position was more reclined, so the driver was almost lying down, compared to the more upright position of the Lotus 18. == Lotus 20B == The 20B was similar to the 20, but with a sway bar and inboard drum brakes at the rear. Occasionally, Lotus 20Bs were raced with other engines, and consequently did not make it into Formula Junior, but did make it into other series such as the Tasman. == References == Category:Automobiles Category:1960s automobiles",
