 "text": "McCartney is Paul McCartney's first solo album. Paul McCartney was part of the famous band The Beatles. Apple Records released it on 17 April 1970. McCartney recorded it in secret. He mostly used home-recording equipment at his house in St John's Wood. Professional London studios did some of the mixing and recording. It has loosely arranged performances. McCartney decided to be different from the Beatles' past records: He did not want a polished, precise sound. Instead, he used a lo-fi style. Apart from some contributions by his wife, Linda, McCartney performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape. McCartney recorded the album when he had depression and felt confused. This was shortly after John Lennon left the Beatles in September 1969. Conflict over the release of McCartney's album made it harder for McCartney to be friends with his bandmates. He refused to wait to release the album so that the Beatles' album Let It Be could go first. A press release in the form of a self-interview supplied with UK promotional copies of McCartney led to the Beatles' break-up. == Track listing == Side one #\"The Lovely Linda\" – 0:43 #\"That Would Be Something\" – 2:38 #\"Valentine Day\" – 1:39 #\"Every Night\" – 2:31 #\"Hot as Sun/Glasses\" – 2:07 #\"Junk\" – 1:54 #\"Man We Was Lonely\" – 2:56 Side two #\"Oo You\" – 2:48 #\"Momma Miss America\" – 4:04 #\"Teddy Boy\" – 2:22 #\"Singalong Junk\" – 2:34 #\"Maybe I'm Amazed\" – 3:53 #\"Kreen-Akrore\" – 4:15 == References == Category:1970 albums",
