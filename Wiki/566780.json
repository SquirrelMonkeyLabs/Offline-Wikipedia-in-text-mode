He is known for his presentation of U.S. presidential inaugural parades of 12 presidents from Harry S. Truman to Joe Biden (excluding only Donald Trump). ==Personal life== Brotman was born on December 30, 1927 in Washington, D.C.. He sudied at the University of Maryland. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1946 to 1948, then attended the National Academy of Broadcasting. ==Career== In 1949, while a student at the National Academy of Broadcasting, Brotman was recommended by his teacher to serve as an announcer for Harry S. Truman's second inauguration, which was the first presidential inauguration to be televised. Brotman has been behind the microphone for every inaugural parade in Washington, DC, since 1957, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was sworn in for his second term. Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013 was the 15th consecutive ceremony that Brotman has announced, and his 16th overall. In 2017, President-elect Donald Trump's Presidential Inauguration Committee said that Brotman would not broadcast his inauguration, ending his broadcasting streak. Brotman was, however, picked to welcome the National Organizers for the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017 - the day following the Inauguration. Brotman was again selected to serve as announcer for Joe Biden's inaugural parade on January 20, 2021. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Washington, D.C.",
