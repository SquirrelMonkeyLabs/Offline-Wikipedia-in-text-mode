Its mission is to assist in the worldwide development of physics, to foster cooperation in physics and to help in the applications of physics towards solving problems of concern to humanity. The 33rd General Assembly (GA) was special in various ways. It was the first inperson GA in 7 years and the first one held in China. These two features contributed to making this GA an incredible event with lively discussions both on IUPAP matters, on physics, and how our Union and physics can better serve to make our World a better place for all. == Who They Are == The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) is the only international physics organization that is organized and run by the physics community itself.
