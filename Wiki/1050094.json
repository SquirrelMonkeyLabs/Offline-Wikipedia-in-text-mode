Drake sings each month of the calendar while explaining the ups and downs of a relationship. SZA sings about the person she is with, saying that the guy she's with is cheating on other girls with her. Actress Halle Berry was angry because Drake used a picture of her getting slimed at the 2012 Kid's Choice Awards as the cover art for the song. She said he used it without her permission. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2023 songs Category:Drake (musician) songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs Category:R&B; songs",
