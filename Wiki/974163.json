During his studies he worked for the Utrecht University, where he made technical drawings of archaeological history. In 1964 he moved temporary to Toronto, Canada. One of his older sisters lived there for some time. Vermaat started working for Dominion Regalia Ltd., a company that designed clothing and flags. In that period the flag of Canada had to be adjusted a bit by the government, because the old flag of Canada was related to the British flag. The company he worked for got the contract to carry it out. In the official design Vermaat ajusted the Maple Leaf a bit. He made the straight stem a bit wider near the bottom. He did it because he \"liked it better\". He never heard anything back about his adjustment, but it was adopted in the official Canadian flag. He later worked for the Royal Ontario Museum as a decorator, and in his spare time he learted stained glass techniques. In 1966 he moved back to Woerden, and gets a studio from the municipality.
