It was believed to be due to the show's large amounts of violence. But this was due to a pre- planned change of networks airing the program, from NET to MBS/TB. A clean break in airing series was requested. There was a planned end at episode 24. ==Kamen Rider Amazons== To celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Kamen Rider Series, Toei and Amazon.com collaborated on an original Amazon Video series titled Kamen Rider Amazons. ==Cast== * Daisuke Yamamoto/Amazon: Tōru Okazaki * Tōbei Tachibana: Akiji Kobayashi * Masahiko Okamura: Yōji Matsuda * Ritsuko Okamura: Mariko Matsuoka * Narrator: Gorō Naya ==Songs== ; Opening theme * \"Amazon Rider Koko ni Ari\" (\"Amazon Rider is Here\") ** Lyrics: Shotaro Ishinomori ** Composition: Shunsuke Kikuchi ** Artist: Masato Shimon ; Ending theme * \"Amazon Da-Da-Da!!\" ** Lyrics: Saburō Yatsude ** Composition: Shunsuke Kikuchi ** Artist: Masato Shimon Category:Japanese science fiction television series Category:1974 television series debuts Category:1975 television series endings Category:1975 disestablishments in Asia Category:1970s Japanese television series debuts Category:1970s Japanese television series endings",
