 "text": "Muesli (pronounced as ) is a type of breakfast cereal made with rolled oats and other ingredients such as grains, nuts, seeds and fresh or dried fruits. Muesli is often served with milk or yoghurt, or occasionally with fruit juice. These liquids are usually added to soften the muesli and to add extra flavor. Muesli was first developed in 1900 by Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher- Benner. He invented muesli so that patients in his hospital were able to eat a ready-made meal in a dry form, either made fresh or stored. ==References== Category:Breakfast cereals",
