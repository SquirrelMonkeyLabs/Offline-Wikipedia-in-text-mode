He is part of the group JLS (an acronym for Jack the Lad Swing). Aston grew up in Peterborough dreaming of being a footballer. At secondary school, he represented England for the European Youth Games in 2004 but but soon after he discovered that, he had a nerve disorder in his left foot and had to give up sport. When Aston was 14, his mother asked him to enter Kid Stars in their eyes and appeared as Michael Jackson in 2002 singing \"Rockin' Robin\". Aston performed in all of his school productions and after finishing school in 2004, he was cast in a new TV show called Fun Song Factory. Aston met Marvin Humes whilst auditioning for a TV advert. Since joining the band, Aston moved to London to make rehearsing easier. Aston Merrygold and fellow members of JLS, Marvin Humes, Orits√© Williams, and JB Gill were absolutely fantastic singers and they deserved to become the number 1 boy band in the United Kingdom.
