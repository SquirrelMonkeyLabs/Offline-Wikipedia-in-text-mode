 "text": "Aromobates is a group of frogs. People call them skunk frogs in English. These frogs live in the Andes Mountains in Venezuela and Colombia. At first, scientists only put one species of frog in this group: Aromobates nocturnus. Later, they decided that the frogs in Nephelobates belonged in this group too. ==Name== The name Aromobates comes from the Latin aroma, meaning \"good smell.\" The smell of the type species, Aromobates nocturnus, is like the smell of a skunk. ==Bodies== Aromobates are small to medium-sized frogs that have colors that make them hard to see. They have strong bodies and webbed skin on their back feet. For example, the small Aromobates meridensis and Aromobates walterarpi are around from nose to rear end and have webbed back feet, and the big Aromobates nocturnus (up to in females) also have webbed back feet. ==Species== There are 18 species, many of them endangered: * Aromobates alboguttatus (Boulenger, 1903) (Possibly Extinct) * Aromobates cannatellai Barrio-Amorós and Santos, 2012 * Aromobates capurinensis (Péfaur, 1993) * Aromobates duranti (Péfaur, 1985) (Critically Endangered) * Aromobates ericksonae Barrio-Amorós and Santos, 2012 * Aromobates haydeeae (Rivero, 1978) (Possibly Extinct) * Aromobates leopardalis (Rivero, 1978) (Possibly Extinct) * Aromobates mayorgai (Rivero, 1980) (Endangered) * Aromobates meridensis (Dole and Durant, 1972) (Critically Endangered) * Aromobates molinarii (La Marca, 1985) (Critically Endangered) * Aromobates nocturnus Myers, Paolillo-O., and Daly, 1991 (Critically Endangered) * Aromobates ornatissimus Barrio-Amorós, Rivero, and Santos, 2011 * Aromobates orostoma (Rivero, 1978) (Critically Endangered) * Aromobates saltuensis (Rivero, 1980) (Endangered) * Aromobates serranus (Péfaur, 1985) (Possibly Extinct) * Aromobates tokuko Rojas-Runjaic, Infante-Rivero, and Barrio-Amorós, 2011 * Aromobates walterarpi La Marca and Otero-López, 2012 * Aromobates zippeli Barrio-Amorós and Santos, 2012 ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
