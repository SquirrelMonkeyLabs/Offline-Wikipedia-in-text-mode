 "text": "A cul-de-sac (literally \"bottom of bag\") is a word that came from the French language and means a small street without a way through at the far end. It is also used in Catalan and Occitan, its meaning being equivalent to a dead end, close, or no through road (United Kingdom, Australian and Canadian English). While culs-de-sac were built in history for other reasons, its modern use is to calm down the traffic. Category:Real estate Category:Roads Category:Urban design",
