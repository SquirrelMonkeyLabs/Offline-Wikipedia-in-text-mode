 "text": "Hi-NRG (pronounced \"high energy\") is a genre of uptempo disco or electronic dance music (EDM) that originated during the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a music genre, typified by its fast tempo, staccato hi-hat rhythms (and the four-on-the-floor pattern), reverberated \"intense\" vocals and \"pulsating\" octave basslines, it was particularly influential on the disco scene. ==See also== *Italo disco *New wave *Post-disco *Synth-pop Category:Music genres",
