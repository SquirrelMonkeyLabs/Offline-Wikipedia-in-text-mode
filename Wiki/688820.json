 "text": "A xerocole (from Modern Greek xēros /ˈzɪroʊs/, meaning 'dry', and Latin col(ere), meaning 'to inhabit'), is an animal adapted to live in the desert. The main problems these animals face is very little water to drink, and a very hot environment. Xerocoles tend to be nocturnal or crepuscular to escape the heat. ==Saving up water== Xerocoles have many ways to conserve (save up) the water in their body. Most xerocoles do not sweat or sweat very little. Many desert birds and mammals have oils on their skin to prevent water from escaping. There is also very little water in their urine and feces. ==Different types of xerocoles== *Aardvark *American black bear *Chipmunk *Coyote *Gila monster *Gemsbok *Hyena *Lion *Meerkat *Ostrich And so on.
