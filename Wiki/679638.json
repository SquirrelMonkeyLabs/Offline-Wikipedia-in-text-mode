 "text": "Majungasaurus is a medium-sized hunting dinosaur from Madagascar in the Late Cretaceous Period. It is a cousin to the more famous Carnotaurus. Fossils found of this Cretaceous species were first attributed to the closely related Majungatholus. But, now it turns out that Majungasaurus and Majungatholus were in fact the same dinosaur. Majungasaurus is also known as a cannibal, meaning that it eats others of its species. This usually happens in series such as Jurassic Fight Club and Planet Dinosaur.
