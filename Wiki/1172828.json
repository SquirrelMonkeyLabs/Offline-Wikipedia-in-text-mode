 "text": "National Geographic Brazil was a Brazilian pay television channel owned by Disney Media Networks Latin America, a division of The Walt Disney Company Latin America. The channel aimed to present documentaries, series and educational programs on science, technology, history and the environment. On February 5, 2017, the Fox channels were removed from Sky's schedule due to a lack of agreement in negotiations between the two companies. The Nat Geo channel was replaced by the Discovery Civilization channel. The two companies reached an agreement on the renewal of the contract on February 10 and the Nat Geo channel was again broadcast on Sky's schedule instead of Discovery Civilization. ==Overview== Being the first Latin American country to receive the channel, the channel's broadcasts in Brazil replaced the independent channel The Superstation on November 1, 2000, launched by Fox Networks Group Latin America. According to people close to the channel, its launch in the country was due to the sales success of the National Geographic Magazine. ==Closing== On December 2, 2024, it was announced that its programming would end in Brazil, which would occur on February 28, 2025. The main reason is due to a strategy by The Walt Disney Company to focus only on its Disney+ streaming service, in addition to the constant drop in the number of pay TV subscribers, drastically affecting its audience. Although the end in Brazil was announced for the 28th, the channel only had its signal closed at 7 am on March 1, after the broadcast of the series The Food Factory: United States. The poster was replaced by an informative slide, despite having been released the day before by pay-TV and streaming operators. == References == Category:Television channels in South America Category:National Geographic Society",
