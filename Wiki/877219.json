 "text": "The Good Law Project is a United Kingdom-based political non-profit company. It was started by Jolyon Maugham. The Good Law Project says that its mission is to achieve change through the law. The Good Law Project challenges the \"culture of cronyism and the highly secretive use of billions of pounds of public funds\". ==History== The Good Law Project was started in January 2017 as a company limited by guarantee under English law headed by Maugham. It is a non-profit but not a registered charity. In 2019 it launched a successful crowdfunded challenge to the prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson's Conservative government. The prorogation was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. The £200,000 raised enabled Good Law Project to hire more staff and launch other fundraisers to take on more cases. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the government gave influential jobs to people closely connected to Conservative politicians. This was without interviews or open competition. They awarded contracts to companies that had no experience. An example was the appointment of Dido Harding, wife of a Conservative MP, to head the new National Institute for Health Protection. Another example was the awarding of a Contract for more than £250m of personal protective equipment to a Florida-based jewellery company. This included a £21m payment to an intermediary. There was no advertisement or competitive tender process. As of September 2021, Good Law Project has applied for Judicial Review in 14 cases and was granted approval in 11. ==References== Category:2017 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Non-profit organisations of the United Kingdom",
