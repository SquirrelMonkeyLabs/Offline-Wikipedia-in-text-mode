 "text": "Fantasy Fest is a street party in Key West, Florida It is held every year, in the last week of October. Its highlight is its parade, which has many humourous floats. A number of people started the event in 1979, to bring more tourists during the slow season. Fantasy Fest has been compared to New Orleans Mardi Gras and Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Nudity is illegal in Key West, but on the last two days of Fantasy Fest the city designates a \"Fantasy Zone\" in the city where women may expose their breasts if they are covered with body paint. Costumes worn at Fantasy Fest often feature nudity and sexual symbolism. == References == Category:Florida",
