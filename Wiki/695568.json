 "text": "The New Democratic Party of British Columbia (BC NDP) is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. It is a social democratic party and is considered to be centre-left. David Eby has been the leader of the party since 2022. The party is a part of the federal New Democratic Party. The party is the one governing the province right now. This is because there was a hung parliament after the 2017 elections and the BC Liberal Party did not win a motion of no confidence in the legislature. Instead, the BC NDP began a confidence and supply deal with the BC Green Party to form a minority government. Before that, the party governed British Columbia under six different premiers. They also won a majority government three times, in 1971, 1991, and 1996. ==History== ===2014â€“2022: Horgan as leader=== The leader before 2014 was Adrian Dix. He resigned from being the leader of the BC NDP in 2013. Because of this, there was an election in the party in 2014 to decide who would be the next leader. John Horgan was elected by acclamation (when there are no other candidates). Because he became leader, he also became the Leader of the Opposition in the legislature. The first election that the NDP took part in while Horgan was the leader was the 2017 general election. The NDP won 41 seats in the election. The other parties that won seats were the Liberal Party (43 seats) and the Green Party (3 seats). The Liberal Party did not win enough seats to form a majority government so the first minority government in BC in 65 years was elected. This was a very close election. The Liberals won the popular vote by only 1566 votes. Because both parties did not have enough seats to form a majority government, the Greens held the balance of power. Both the Liberals and NDP began negotiating with the Greens to see if they would support a minority government by either of the parties. On 29 May, Horgan and the Greens announced that the Greens would support the NDPs in a confidence and supply deal. The Liberals lost a vote of no confidence vote by two votes to the Greens and NDP. Because of this, the Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon asked Horgan to form government and become the next premier. Horgan became the first NDP premier in 16 years. On November 4, 2021, Horgan announced that he had a malignant tumor in his throat and that he would need radiation treatment. On June 28, 2022, Horgan said he would step down as both premier and leader of the BC NDP party when a new leader was been selected. On October 21, 2022, David Eby would be elected as the Horgan's successor. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Political parties in Canada Category:1933 establishments in North America Category:Social democratic parties Category:1930s establishments in Canada Category:Organizations based in British Columbia",
