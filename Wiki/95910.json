 "text": "Epimetheus is a titan in Greek mythology, and is the brother of Prometheus, a Greek titan who gave all of the creatures something to protect themselves from the elements. By the time he came to the humans, he had run out of feathers and fur to give. He went to his brother, and he gave humans fire. Epimetheus literally means \"thinks after\" and Prometheus means \"thinks before\". == References == * Kerenyi, Karl, 1951.
