 "text": "\"I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar\" is the 8th episode of Family Guys 2nd season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on March 28, 2000. It was written by Chris Sheridan and Monte Young is the director of the episode. In the episode, Peter Griffin must go to a retreat after he tells a sexist joke at his job. The episode was broadcast on the same day as the one before it (\"The King Is Dead\"). This made Seth MacFarlane (creator of Family Guy) worried that the show would get cancelled. In July 2013, a complaint to A&W; Restaurants about their \"Burger Family\" was rejected. The complaint said that the Burger Family was harming the LGBT community. The person who made the complaint used the name \"Gloria Ironbox\". Ironbox is a character in the episode that parodies feminism. The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario did not look into the complaint and called it \"an abuse of process.\" == References == == Other websites == * Category:Family Guy episodes Category:2000 television episodes",
