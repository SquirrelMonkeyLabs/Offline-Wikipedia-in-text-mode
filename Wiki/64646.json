However some religious women, cover their faces with their chador too. A chador is a full-length semi-circle of fabric open down the front. It is thrown over the head and held shut in front. A chador has no hand openings or closures but is held shut by the hands or by wrapping the ends around the waist. == Related page == *Hijab *Women and Islam Category:Islamic dress",
