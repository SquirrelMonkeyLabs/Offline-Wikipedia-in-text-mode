 "text": "Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (, Akbar H훮shem카 Rafanj훮n카), Hashemi Bahramani (; August 25, 1934 - January 8, 2017) was an influential Iranian politician. He has been the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran from 1989 until his death in 2017. Forbes magazine listed Rafsanjani in their list of richest people in the world and has written that as the real power behind the Iranian government, he \"has more or less run the Islamic Republic for the past 24 years.\" His wealth has earned him the infamous nickname of Akbar Shah in Iran. Rafsanjani was President of Iran from 1989 to 1997, losing on the second ballot to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election on his attempt for a third term in office. After this, he has tried to use his position in the Expediency Council to denounce President Ahmadinejad's administration. He said he would do some privatizations and change foreign policy. However, President Ahmadinejad has noted Rafsanjani's failure to make a difference between privatization and self takeover of government-owned companies. Ahmadinejad has also commmented on the foreign policies of Rafsanjani's administration which lead to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996.http://www.tik.ir/display/?ID=38335&page;=1 http://www.rajanews.com/News/?6881http://www.rajanews.com/News/?5081 Currently, one of his sons has been accused of receiving a bribe. Analysts expect that his son will not be put on trial, however. Rafsanjani died on January 8, 2017 in Tehran from a heart attack, aged 82. ==References== == Other websites == *Profile: Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani at BBC News *Profile: Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani at www.aljazeera.com ===Video clips=== *Rafsanjani and Al-Qaradhawi on Muslim Unity - Part 1 *Rafsanjani and Al-Qaradhawi on Muslim Unity - Part 2 Category:1934 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Iranian clerics Category:Iranian Muslims Category:Speakers of the Islamic Consultative Assembly Category:Presidents of Iran",
