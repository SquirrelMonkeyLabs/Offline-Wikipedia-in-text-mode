 "text": "The Guti () or Quti, also known by the derived Gutians or Guteans, were a nomadic people of West Asia, around the Zagros Mountains (Modern Iran) during ancient times. ==History== Their homeland was known as Gutium (Sumerian: ,Gu- tu-umki or ,Gu-ti-umki).ETCSL. The Sumerian King List . Accessed 19 Dec 2010.ETCSL. The Cursing of Agade Accessed 18 Dec 2010. There has been little scholarly support for theories linking the Turkic names Kutrigur and Utigur to the Gutians. Widely believed to have spoken an Indo-European (rather than Turkic) language. Iranologist W. B. Henning proposed that the Yuezhi were descended from the Guti (Gutians) and a closely associated but little known tribe referred to as the Tukri (Turki), who were native to the Zagros mountains during the mid-3rd millennium BC.W.B. Henning (1908 - 1967) \"THE FIRST INDO-EUROPEANS IN HISTORY\", Society and History. Essays in Honour Karl August Wittfogel // Ed. by G.L.Ulmen, Hague-Paris-New York, 1978, pp. 215-230 Analysing the grammatical structure of the Gutian language, German Assyriologists Benno Landsberger, however, came to the conclusion that the Gutians not only were closely related to Turkic peoples, but most probably even identical.Landsberger B., 1937, (Acts of the Congress), Basic questions of the early history of the Near East (Grundfragen der Frühgeschichte Vorderasiens), Türkischer Geschichtskongress, Devlet Basımevi, Istanbul, page 73-74. Quote: \"Dieses Volk der Gutium oder Kutium, dessen Namen wir nach Streichurig der akkadischen Nisbe als Kut ansetzen können, ist aber, wenn nicht gewichtige Anzeichen truegen, der weitaus alteste in unsere Geschichte eingetretene Stamm, der mit den Tuerken aufs engste verwandt, ja vielleicht identisch ist.\" (PDF) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Ethnic groups in Asia",
