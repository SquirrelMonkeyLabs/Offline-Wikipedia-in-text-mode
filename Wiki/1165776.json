 "text": "Allobates bacurau is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 14.0-14.7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 14.7-14.9 mm long. The skin of the frog's belly is light gray to white in color. Both male and female adult frogs have dark gray throats. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in small pieces of forest. Scientists do not know if this frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. Scientists have not seen the frog inside any protected parks. The frog was found near Parque Nacional do Juruena and scientists think it might live there. ==Young== Scientists do not know much about how this frog raises its young. They think the female frog lays eggs on land and, after the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the frogs to water. They think this because that is what other frogs in Allobates do. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
