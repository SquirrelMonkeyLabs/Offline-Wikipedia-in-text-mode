 "text": "A micro-hydro power (MHP) plant is a type of hydroelectric power scheme that makes electricity using a flowing stream or a water flow. Micro-hydro systems are mostly used in developing countries to give electricity to isolated communities or rural villages where there is no electricity grid connected. Feeding back into the national grid when electricity production is in surplus is also evident in some cases. The design of a micro-hydro plan can be addressed for each household or for each village often involving nearby materials and labor. Category:Electricity",
