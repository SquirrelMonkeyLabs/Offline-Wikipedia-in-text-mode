 "text": "The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange is an American live- action/animated television series. It was created by Aaron Horvath and Dane Boedigheimer for Cartoon Network. The series is based on the characters from the web series The Annoying Orange. That series was created by Boedigheimer and Tom Sheppard. It was produced by Boedigheimer, Annoying Orange, Inc., Cartoon Network Studios, and Warner Bros. Animation. It had a total of two seasons and sixty episodes, with a total of thirty episodes per season. == Plot == The show follows the lives of Annoying Orange and his friends: the sarcastic Pear, the sassy Passion Fruit, the tiny Midget Apple, the eccentric Marshmallow, the unlucky Apple, the elderly Grandpa Lemon, and the egocentric Grapefruit. The show diverges from the YouTube series in that the Fruit Gang lives on a fruit stand in a supermarket called \"Dane Boe's\" (a reference to the creator Dane Boedigheimer) rather than in Dane Boedigheimer's kitchen. A reoccurring character from the Annoying Orange YouTube series called Nerville (played by internet personality Toby Turner) now runs the supermarket (mainly as the janitor), and is the only human who can talk to the fruit. == Characters == * Orange (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) is the main protagonist of the series. Much like his web counterpart, Orange is annoying, obnoxious, and partial to terrible puns, but always means well, even though his quirks often drag his friends into ridiculous adventures. The series shows another side of Orange that differs from his YouTube persona and casts him as a wacky hero. * Pear (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) is Orange's best friend, often serving as the sole voice-of-reason in the fruit stand (though he usually goes ignored). * Passion Fruit (voiced by Justine Ezarik) â€“ Often referred to as \"Passion\", she is adorable, pragmatic, and smart. She has a crush on Orange, unlike the web series where the roles are reversed, to which Orange is completely oblivious, even though everyone else sees how obvious it is. * Midget Apple/Little Apple (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) is a small apple with a scrappy demeanor. He prefers to be called \"Little Apple\", and a running gag is that he will correct anyone who calls him \"Midget Apple\". * Marshmallow (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) is a cute, eternally upbeat, and cheerful marshmallow. * Grapefruit (voiced by Bob Jennings) is a prideful narcissist with an ego problem who thinks of himself as \"large and in charge\" and often brags about things he's yet to accomplish. He believes he is in a rivalry with Orange for Passion Fruit's affections, but she has no interest in him. * Apple (voiced by Harland Williams) is an insecure pessimist who rarely joins Orange's adventures for fear he will get bruised, though he usually ends up even worse off by staying behind. There is a running gag where Apple gets killed and/or maimed in every episode, similar to Kenny McCormick from South Park. * Grandpa Lemon (voiced by Kevin Brueck) is the befuddled, elder statesman of the fruit stand. He thinks he is everybody's grandpa and has a habit of falling asleep mid-sentence. * Nerville (played by Toby Turner) is an employee at Daneboe's Fruit Store, where he lives, and is the only human who can talk to the fruits (as other humans dismiss it as insanity). He is a close friend to the fruits. == Episodes == === Season 1 (2012-2013) === # Marshmallia / Captain Blood Orange (June 9, 2012) # Sir Juice a Lot / Veggie Zombies (June 16, 2012) # Foundering Fruits / Fruit-Vengers (June 30, 2012) # Dr. Strange Plum / Bad News Pears (July 21, 2012) # Fruit Plane / The Lords of Fruitbush (August 4, 2012) # Boys vs Girls / Fruitastic Voyage (August 18, 2012) # Escape from the Planet of the Grapes of Wrath / Follow the Bouncing Orange (September 8, 2012) # Spaghetti West / Welcome to my Fruitmare (September 15, 2012) # Annoying Cutsie / The Day the Store Stood Still (September 29, 2012) # The Annoying Orange Generic Holiday Special / Orange Carol (November 24, 2012) # Orange the Red / Orange Belt (December 30, 2012) # When Fruit Ruled the Earth / Pop Star (January 6, 2013) # The Fast and the Fruitious / Trans.Fruit.Bots (January 13, 2013) # Chief Executive Orange / Meet the Oranges (January 20, 2013) # Fruitloose / My Name is Orange (January 27, 2013) === Season 2 (2013-2014) === # Little Fruit Cutie / Isle of Dr. Fruitenstein (May 15, 2013) # Orange's Run / Marshmallow Wedding (May 22, 2013) # Orange James Orange / Avocadotar (May 29, 2013) # Food Carnival / Fruitdependece Day (July 3, 2013) # Everybody Love Cabbage / King Coco (July 17, 2013) # The Further Adventures of Shreleek Holmes / Fruitrama (July 17, 2013) # Cereal Killer / Orange Julius Caesar (September 4, 2013) # Armagourdon / Orange Say Knock You Out (September 11, 2013) # Hungry Fruit Games / Peargeist (October 2, 2013) # Bat's All, Fruits / Little Cart of Scaries (October 16, 2013) # Thanksfornothing Day / Fruitsy the Snowman (November 27, 2013) # Shakesparagus Speare / FruitBalls (January 10, 2014) # Clementine's Day / Mash of the Titans (January 17, 2014) # Lost Fruit Pyramid / Meet Banana Monocle (January 24, 2014) # Defending your Fruitcart (January 31, 2014) Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2012 American television series debuts Category:2014 American television series endings",
