 "text": "A general election was held on 12 December 2019 to elect all 650 members to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The Conservative Party won with a landslide majority and Boris Johnson stayed as Prime Minister. The Labour Party lost 60 seats, giving them their lowest number of seats (202) since 1935. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn quit after the loss saying he \"would not lead Labour at the next election\". This led to a leadership election in the party where Keir Starmer became the new leader. 34 MPs out of the 650 elected had quit or been disciplined by their party or by parliamentary colleagues over claims of bad behaviour by the end of 2023. This was more than any previous parliament. ==Summary== A summarised results of the parties that won seats at the election is as follows: Party Party Leader MPs MPs MPs Votes Votes Party Party Leader Of total Of total Conservative Party Boris Johnson 365 13,966,565 43.6% Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn 202 10,269,076 32.2% Scottish National Party Nicola Sturgeon 48 1,242,380 3.9% Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson 11 3,696,423 11.6% Democratic Unionist Party Arlene Foster 8 244,128 0.8% Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald 7 181,853 0.6% Plaid Cymru Adam Price 4 153,265 0.5% Social Democratic and Labour Party Colum Eastwood 2 118,737 0.4% Green Party of England and Wales Jonathan Bartley Siân Berry 1 835,579 2.7% Alliance Party of Northern Ireland Naomi Long 1 134,115 0.4% Lindsay Hoyle 1 26,831 0.1% ==Notes== ==References== Category:United Kingdom general elections Category:December 2019 events Category:2019 elections in Europe",
