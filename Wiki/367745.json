It is one of 74 local government areas in South Australia. The people who originally live in this region are Wirangu and Mirning. However, most of the people who live at Yalata are Pitjantjatjara, who originally come from the north (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara). They speak a southern dialect of the Pitjantjatjara language. This is spoken as a first language in most homes (58% in 2006).ABS 2006 Yearbook. Retrieved on 5 June 2008 The other groups making up the land's traditional owners are the Kokatha, Yankunytjatjara, Antakirinja, Pindiini and Ngalea, which are all nations of the Western Desert. Pitjantjatjara were forced to move here by the Australian government in the 1950s. Large parts of their land in the north were made into the Woomera Test Range, a weapons testing area. The families were first moved south, to a Christian mission at Ooldea. They were moved to Yalata, even further south, in 1952.A toxic legacy : British nuclear weapons testing in Australia in: This second move was done because of nuclear-weapon tests being done at Maralinga and Emu Field.United Kingdom Parliament, Atomic Test Site (South Australia) , House of Commons, 1 April 1993, columns 645â€“652, (Norman A. Godman, Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow).
