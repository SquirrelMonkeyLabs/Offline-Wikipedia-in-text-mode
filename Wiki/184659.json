 "text": "Abram Games (29 July 191427 August 1996) was a British graphic designer. He was born Abraham Gamse. He was the son of immigrants: a Latvian photographer and a Russo-Polish (part Russian, part Polish) seamstress. He anglicized (make something sound more English) his name to Games at age 12 and was basically an autodidactic designer, and went to London's St. Martins School of Art (today named the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) for only two terms. However, while working as a \"studio boy\" (a general assistant) in commercial design company Askew-Young in London 1932-36, he took night classes in life drawing. In 1934, his entry was second in the Health Council Competition and in 1935 he won a poster competition for the London City Council. From 1936 to 1940 he was on his own as a freelance poster artist. == Exhibition == * Abram Games, Graphic Designer (1914â€“1996): Maximum Meaning, Minimum Means, Design Museum, London, 2003 == References == * Amstutz, W.
