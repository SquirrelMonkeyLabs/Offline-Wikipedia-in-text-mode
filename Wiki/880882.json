 "text": "Sarcohyla is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. These frogs live in Mexico and the hills and mountains between Durango in the north and Guerrero in the south. These frogs live in habitats that humans have not changed too much, near streams in pine-oak forests between above sea level. The name comes from the Greek sarkodes meaning \"fleshy\" and from Hylas. It is for the thick, glandular skin of most of the frogs in the genus. ==Description== Sarcohyla are medium sized or large frogs. They have thick skin with glands. They have large thumbs and no projecting spine. The alary process of the premaxilla does not split into two pieces like it does in some other frogs. ==Taxonomy== Scientists first invented Sarcohyla in 2016 using molecular data. The species in Sarcohyla had been in the Hyla bistincta, Hyla arborescandens and Plectrohyla bistincta groups. Sarcohyla's sister group is Plectrohyla. Not all species in Sarcohyla were included in the molecular analysis, so not all scientists are sure the genus is monophyletic. ==Species== The genus has 26 species in it: ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
