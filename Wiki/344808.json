 "text": "The Treaty of Paris was a treaty between Louis IX of France and Henry III of England, agreed to on December 4, 1259. It is also known as Treaty of Albeville. It was mainly about territories that England had obtained in 1180, in Normandy. Philip II of France had conquered many of these territories. England lost the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, and was weakened on the European mainland. Louis VII of France strengthened this position. The English were left with Gascony and Bordeaux. The treaty also gave the Channel Islands to England. Henry gave up control of Maine, Anjou and Poitou, which had been lost under the reign of King John but remained Duke of Aquitaine and was able to keep the lands of Gascony and parts of Aquitaine but only as a vassal to Louis. In exchange, Louis withdrew his support for English rebels. He also ceded to Henry the bishoprics and cities of Limoges, Cahors and PÃ©rigueux and was to pay an annual rent for possession of Agenais.Harry Rothwell (Editor) English Historical Documents 1189-1327, Routledge, 1996, ==References== Paris 1259 Category:13th century in France Category:13th century in England Category:Normandy Category:Channel Islands Category:1259",
