 "text": "The Lone Ranger is a 30-minute American western television series. It stars Clayton Moore as The Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as The Lone Ranger's Indian pal Tonto. The series was one of the highest-rated series in television's early years and ABC's first true \"hit\". Its first run lasted from September 15, 1949 to June 8, 1957. Its first five seasons were broadcast in black and white. Its last season aired in color. There was a total of 221 episodes. George Trendle and Fran Striker were producers. John Hart briefly took the role of The Lone Ranger while Moore was tied-up in a salary dispute with producers. Oil millionaire Jack Wrather bought the show in 1954. Wrather's other television properties included the hit series Lassie and Sgt. Preston of the Yukon. Two feature-length movies were produced after the show was canceled, The Lone Ranger (co-starring Wrather's wife Bonita Granville Wrather) and The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold. Some episodes are available on video and DVD. The series is sometimes seen in reruns. The series was known for its use of classical music collected from many sources. Especially famous was the series's opening and closing music, a part of Gioachino Rossini's William Tell Overture. Equally well known were the cries heard at the end of each episode of \"Who was that masked man?\" and The Lone Ranger's \"Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!\" Much merchandise was manufactured during the series run such as toys, games, costumes, guns and holsters, and comic books.
