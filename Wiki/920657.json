 "text": "Radiodonta is an extinct order of ancient arthropods that was successful during the Cambrian period. They can be called radiodonts and radiodontans along with other names. Radiodonts are identified by distinct appendages on their faces, which are diverse and can do a lot of things. Some of the earliest top predators, such as Anomalocaris are Radiodonts, but some others, such as Aegirocassis were filter feeders, eating by filtering food out of the water around them.
