Pokémon Colosseum was released on November 21, 2003 in Japan, March 22, 2004 in North America, and on May 14, 2004 in Europe. The concept for Pokémon Colosseum was influenced by RPGs like Final Fantasy VII and Persona 2: Innocent Sin. During an interview with Prima Games, Pokémon director Junichi Masuda was asked why the gameplay did not mirror that of the other games in the series. Masuda said \"How players communicate with each other has been key to the Pokémon games – it is the backbone of all Pokémon game designs. I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game.\" The game was first shown at E3 2003. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 7.5 out of 10. Craig Harris of IGN said that the Pokémon RPG's move to 3D \"does a decent enough job\" and is \"a bit more linear and straightforward\". In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked the game as the 121st greatest video game to appear on a Nintendo console. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2003 video games Category:Nintendo GameCube games Category:Nintendo GameCube-only games Category:Pokémon RPGs Category:Video games developed in Japan",
