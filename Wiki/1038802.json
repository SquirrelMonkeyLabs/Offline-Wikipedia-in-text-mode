 "text": "Dutta's bubble-nest frog or Hassan bush frog (Raorchestes hassanensis) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Raorchestes flaviventris but they changed their minds in 2015. This frog lives in evergreen forests and shola forests. People have also seen it on coffee farms and tea farms. It can live in forests that have changed a little, but it cannot live in forests where the tree branches do not come together like a roof at all. Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because the place it lives is not very big. However, that place is not becoming worse right now, and the frog can live in places that human beings have changed, for example coffee farms and tea farms. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can make other frogs in Raorchestes sick, so the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
