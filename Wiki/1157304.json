 "text": "The Cerrado rocket frog or Goias rocket frog (Allobates goianus) is a frog. It lives in Brazil, in Goiás. ==Home== This frog lives on the dead leaves on the ground in forests. It leaves near streams and ponds. Scientists saw the frog between 700 and 1700 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in protected parks: Floresta Nacional de Silvania, which is small, Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros, RPPN Reserva Natural Serra do Tombador, and Área de Preservação Ambiental Pouso Alto. Scientists say that it does not live in the Floresta Nacional de Silvania any more. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives by cutting down trees with fires, towns, dams, places for animals to eat grass, tree farms and other farms, for example soybean farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
