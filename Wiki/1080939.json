 "text": "Cigarette smoking for weight loss is a method of losing weight by consuming tobacco usually in the form of cigarettes to decrease their appetite. Tobacco smoking was seen as related to decreasing appetite by Native Americans and Old World Europeans.Gatley, I. 2003. Tobacco: A Cultural History of How an Exotic Plant Seduced Civilization. New York: Grove Press, p.38 Many cigarette companies also made connections between smoking and slimness mainly in advertisements targeting females. == Appetite suppression == Nicotine is shown as unhealthy by public health professionals even though it is an appetite suppressant. Nicotine also influences a person's eating habits and what they eat. A study on nicotine's effects showed that nicotine decreased blood pressure, heart rate, and fat.Young-Hwan, Jo, David A. Talmage, and Lorna W. Role,“Nicotinic Receptor-Mediated Effects on Appetite and Food Intake,” Journal of Neurobiology 53.4 (2002), p.622. Nicotine gum is also commonly used instead of cigarettes for weight loss and is commonly prescribed by health professionals. Nicotine also lowers insulin levels which reduces and eventually removes the want for food high in fructose.Kluger, Richard Ashes to Ashes: America’s Hundred-year Cigarette War, the Public Health, and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris, (New York: Alfred A. Knopf Inc., 1996). Furthermore, Nicotine helps burn off calories during exercise as well and makes you feel full which can prevent illnesses like diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. == References == Category:Smoking",
