 "text": "Ariane 5 was a European space launcher launched from Kourou in French Guiana. Its first flight was on June 7, 1996. The Ariane 5 had 5 failures. However, the Ariane 5 was considered a workhorse of spaceflight, having many flights and launching many payloads into space, including the James Webb Space Telescope. The Ariane 5 has been retired and is soon to be replaced by the newer, cheaper, and more capable Ariane 6. Category:Spaceflight Category:French Guiana",
