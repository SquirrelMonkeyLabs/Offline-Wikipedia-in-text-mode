Her father was King Eric II of Norway and her mother was a Scottish princess, also named Margaret. Margaret's mother's father was Alexander III, the king of Scotland. When Alexander died, the Scottish lords decided his granddaughter Margaret should be their queen. At that time, Margaret was three years old. The Scottish lords and King Erik agreed that Margaret would marry Edward, an English prince. Then, Scotland and England would be one kingdom. In 1290, Margaret got on a ship to go from Norway to Scotland. On the way, she became sick. The ship stopped in Orkney, where Margaret died. She was buried in Bergen, Norway. ==References== Category:Norwegian people Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland Category:1283 births Category:1290 deaths Category:13th century in Scotland",
