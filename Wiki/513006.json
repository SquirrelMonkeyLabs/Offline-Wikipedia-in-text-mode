 "text": "The Rus were a group of Norsemen from Sweden who settled in modern-day Ukraine, Belarus, and northwestern Russia. Their name comes from the word Ruotsi, an Old Norse term meaning \"the men who row\". The Rus' were responsible for the foundation of the Kievan Rus' state. The East Slavic tribes who were native to the area north of Kyiv were exploited by the Rus' and mainly sold off as slaves. == Who were they? == Most western scholars believe them to be a group of Varangians. F. Donald Logan, The Vikings in History, Third Edition (New York; Oxford: Routledge, 2004), p. 184 According to the Povist vremennykh lit or Primary Chronicle of Rus', compiled in about 1113 AD, the Rus' had relocated from Pomerania.The Russian Primary Chronicle, trans. & eds. Samuel Hazzard Cross; Olgerd P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor (Cambridge MA: Medieval Academy of America, 1953), pp. 20, 233 Their leader was named Rurik. Later, Rurik's relative Oleg captured Kiev, founding Kievan Rus'. The descendants of Rurik were the ruling dynasty of Rus' (after 862). In the controversy, this is called the \"Normanist\" view. Most scholars believe that name Rus came from Swedish Vikings originating from Rothi or Roslagen as it is known today. F. Donald Logan, The Vikings in History, Third Edition (New York; Oxford: Routledge, 2004), p. 184 The \"anti-Normanist\" view is that the Rus' were Slavic people from south of Kiev.Omeljan Pritsak, 'I. The Normanist versus Anti-Normanist Controversy', The Russian Review (July 1977), pp. 249-273 (abridged), In support of this theory it has been pointed out that several rivers have similar names. Once example is the Ros river which is a tributary of the Dnieper river. This may have been where the Rus' took their name. The official Soviet Union history did not include the Norman viewpoint giving the reason: \"The Normanist theory is politically harmful, because it denies the ability of the Slavic nations to form an independent state by their own efforts.\" === The invitation === The story from the Primary Chronicle is that the Slavs of Kiev were fighting among themselves.Russia and Western Civilization: Cutural and Historical Encounters, ed. Russell Bova (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 2003), p. 12 To restore order they invited the legendary Varangian Rus Rurik to be their leader. This is another area of controversy. One school of thought accepts the Primary Chronicle account with the Norman origin of the Rus' people.Paul Robert Magocsi, A History of Ukraine (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1996), p. 61 The opposing view says the Scandinavians played a small part in the creation of the Kievan Rus. The Scandinavians were simply hired by the Slavs to protect them. Since the 1990s there has been a further controversy over who, Russia or Ukraine, had a better claim to be descended from the Kievan Rus princes.Serhii Plokhy, The Origins of the Slavic Nations: Premodern Identities in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 10–11 Since the breakup of the USSR Russian historians are not forced to accept the anti- Norman theory. === Byzantines === Another version is possible in this comment by scholars on De Administrando Imperio, by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII (913-959): == Common threads == It was at this point in history the area of Kiev grew and expanded. The Kievan state lasted about a hundred years, until about 972. Between 839 and 1043 the Balto Slavs combined with the South Slavic peoples to form a new society. The name Rus came to mean those combined peoples. In 860 the Byzantine Patriarch Photios I described a people who were almost certainly Rani accompanied by Slavs. The leaders of the Rus had Balto Slavic names even into the tenth century. In 911 the Rus who signed a treaty with the Greeks all had Balto Slavic names. But in the treaty of 945 there were some South Slavonic names.Jill N. Claster, The Medieval Experience, 300-1400 (New York: New York University Press, 1982), pp. 138–140 == Etymology == The word \"Rus' is found in the slavonic languages. This parallels with , and .Katherine Holman, Historical Dictionary of the Vikings (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2003), p. 231 Words used to describe Pomeranians in Russia or the east were Veneti or Rujan (in medieval Latin literature known as Ruzzi ).
