The ballad was written by Elijah Blake, who wrote several songs on the album. It was intentionally written for Mariah Carey and presented to Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson before it got to Cole. Cole's version was finally recorded in 2012 by Kuk Harrell. In the summer of 2012, it was debated as the second single, opposed to \"Trust and Believe\". Cole often cites \"I Choose You\" as one of her favorites from Woman to Woman.https://twitter.com/KeyshiaCole/status/230086096447496192 ==Music video== The music video for the song was filmed in August 2013.
