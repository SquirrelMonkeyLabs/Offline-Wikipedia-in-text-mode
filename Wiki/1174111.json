 "text": "The Ottoman Civil War was a war of succession in the Ottoman Empire from 1509 to 1512, during the reign of Bayezid II, between his two sons Ahmed and Selim. ==War== In 1509, Ahmed, the older claimant, won a battle against the Karaman Turks and their Safavid allies in Asia Minor and marched on Constantinople to exploit his triumph. Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in Thrace but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee to Crimea in 1511. Bayezid II developed fears that Ahmed might then kill him to gain the throne and refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople. Though some sources suggest that the Janissaries acted on their own in preventing Ahmed from entering the city due to their loyalty to Selim. Selim returned from Crimea and, with support from the Janissaries, defeated and eventually killed Ahmed a year later in 1513 after a series of civil disobediences. Bayezid II abdicated the throne on April 25, 1512 and departed for retirement in his native Demotika, but he died along the way and is buried next to Bayezid Mosque, in Constantinople. ==Safavid invasion== During the early days of interregnum, Korkut, one of the princes (Turkish: Şehzade), was travelling from Antalya to Manisa to be closer to the capital. Şahkulu raided his caravan and robbed the treasury. Then he began attacking the towns and killing the government officers in the towns. He also raided Alaşehir to seize a part of the royal treasure. Only then, an Ottoman force under Karagöz Ahmet Pasha, the beylerbey of Anadolu, was sent to check his activities. But Şahkulu defeated the forces of Ahmet Pasha and executed him. This increased the fame and the prestige of Şahkulu. To his partisans, after raiding a royal caravan and killing a high-ranking Ottoman statesman, he was invincible. A second army was sent after him. The commanders of the army were Şehzade Ahmet, one of the claimants to the throne, and the grand vizier Hadım Ali Pasha. They were able to corner Şahkulu near Altıntaş (in modern Kütahya Province), but instead of fighting, Ahmet tried to win over the janissaries for his cause. Failing to achieve this, he left the battlefield. Şahkulu saw his chance and escaped. Ali Pasha with a smaller force chased him, and clashed with him at Çubukova between Kayseri and Sivas.(according to some sources Gökçay) The battle was a draw, but both Ali Pasha and Şahkulu were killed (July 1511). ==Sources== 1\\.
