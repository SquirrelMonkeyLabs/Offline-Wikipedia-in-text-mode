It began east-southeast of Pohnpei. The storm later hit the Philippines with extremely high winds and a strong storm surge. It has caused major damage in the Visayas. At least 6,241 people died in the storm. The director of Meteorology at Weather Underground, Jeff Masters, said this could be the strongest tropical system to reach land. Haiyan's winds were near 195 miles an hour. == Related pages == * Yolanda Memorial Marker * Yolanda Shrine == References == Category:Typhoon Yolanda Category:2013 disasters in Asia Category:2013 in weather Category:2013 in China Category:2010s disasters in Oceania Category:2010s disasters in China Category:Natural disasters in China Category:Disasters in Taiwan Category:Disasters in Vietnam Category:History of Vietnam Category:November 2013 events Category:Deadly storms Category:Retired tropical cyclone names",
