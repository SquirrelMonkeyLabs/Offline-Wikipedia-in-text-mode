 "text": "Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) is an organization that works in Africa to teach people to farm. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation pay for it. The governments of the United Kingdom, United States and Germany also gave money. AGRA started in 2006 with one billion U.S. dollars. According to one study, AGRA actually made things worse for farmers in Africa. AGRA gave loans to farmers so they could buy fertilizer, but the farmers could not pay back the loans. AGRA also told people to grow corn (maize), which meant fewer farmers grew traditional African crops. The African crops were stronger against times with less rain than usual. AGRA also asked African governments to pass laws that made things easier for corporations and seed producers, which were bad for small farmers. == Goals == * doubling the income of 20 million small farmers. * reducing how hard it is to find food by 50% in 20 countries. * ensuring that at least 15 countries are on a path toward sustainable and climate-friendly green agriculture. == References == Category:Agricultural organizations Category:2006 establishments in Africa Category:Non-profit organizations of Africa Category:Organizations based in Kenya",
