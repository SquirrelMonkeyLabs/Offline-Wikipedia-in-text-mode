 "text": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse, previously known as Conseco Fieldhouse and Bankers Life Fieldhouse, is a sports arena located in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. It is the home of the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association and the Indiana Fever of the Women's National Basketball Association. The Fieldhouse also hosts college basketball games (including the annual Big Ten Conference tournaments), indoor concerts, and ice hockey. The Fieldhouse is the home of the Indiana Ice hockey team. The arena opened as Conseco Fieldhouse, named via a contract with the company then known as Conseco, a financial services company based in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel. In 2010, the company renamed itself CNO Financial Group, but temporarily kept the Conseco name on the building. In December 2011, the company changed the arena name to Bankers Life Fieldhouse, after one of its subsidiaries. CNO decided not to renew its naming sponsorship after it expired on June 30, 2019. The \"Bankers Life\" name remained on the arena until September 27, 2021, when Indianapolis-based financial platform Gainbridge entered into a new naming contract. == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:Indoor arenas",
