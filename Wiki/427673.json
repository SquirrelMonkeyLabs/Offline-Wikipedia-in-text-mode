 "text": "An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is a device to capture particles from a flowing gas. It uses the force produced by electrostatic charge. ESPs are used in many power plants which burn fuel to produce energy, such as in power stations. Any gas produced by fuel burning will pollute the air much less after being passed through an ESP.
