 "text": "Gem squash (Cucurbita pepo var. pepo) is a variety, or family, of summer squash. It may have come from two wild types; Cucurbita texana seen in the southern and central United States and Cucurbita fraterna found in Mexico. The dark green round fruit, when fully ripe, is around the size of a tennis ball. The young fruit is often harvested before it is fully ripe when it has a softer flavor. Gem squash is grown a lot in South Africa, and is usually served as a vegetable, often boiled or baked. == References == Category:Vegetables Category:Cucurbitaceae",
