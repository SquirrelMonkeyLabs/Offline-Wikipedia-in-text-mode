 "text": "The Vandal Kingdom (Latin: Regnum Vandalorum; or Regnum Vandalorum et Alanum) was a kingdom of Vandals and Alans in North Africa, formerly Roman Africa. The kingdom was one of the Germanic tribes from Europe that Invaded the Roman Empire in the late 5th Century AD, The kingdom was created under Gaiseric. The Vandals ruled North Africa and controlled the Mediterranean for 100 years. This lasted until the Vandalic conquest of North Africa by the Byzantine Empire. The conquest of North Africa by the Vandals hurt the Western Roman Empire. This was because North Africa was a large source of revenue. It also supplied a large amount of grain, mostly wheat, to the city of Rome. The Vandal Kingdom ended after Belisarius conquered North Africa in 534 . This ended a century rule of the Vandals.
