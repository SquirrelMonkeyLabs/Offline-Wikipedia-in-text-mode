 "text": "The Congressional Western Caucus is a caucus within the United States House of Representatives made of over 90 members. Although it has historically been bipartisan, it is currently made up of mainly of Republicans. It was founded by then-representatives James V. Hansen (R-Utah), Bob Stump (R-Arizona), Joe Skeen (R-New Mexico) and Barbara Vucanovich (R-Nevada) in 1993 during the 103rd United States Congress. Despite its name, the Congressional Western Caucus has members from outside the Western United States, including as far east as New York City and Puerto Rico. ==References== Category:Legislative branch of the United States government",
