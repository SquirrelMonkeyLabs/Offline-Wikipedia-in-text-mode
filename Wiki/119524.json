 "text": "Donald Laurie Edwards (born September 28, 1955 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), known as Don Edwards, is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender who played ten seasons in the National Hockey League for the Buffalo Sabres, Calgary Flames, and Toronto Maple Leafs. He won the Vezina Trophy along with Bob Sauve in 1980. He played in the 1980 and 1982 All-Star Games and backed up Mike Liut in the 1981 Canada Cup. On February 24, 1982, Edwards was a part of history as he gave up Wayne Gretzky's 77th goal of the 1981-82 NHL season in a game vs. the Edmonton Oilers at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Gretzky broke Phil Esposito's former single season record of 76 goals and finished the year with 92, which still stands as an NHL record. == References == == Other websites == * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Calgary Flames players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Hershey Bears players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:National Hockey League broadcasters Category:Nova Scotia Oilers players Category:Sportspeople from Hamilton, Ontario Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Vezina Trophy winners Category:Ontario Hockey League players",
