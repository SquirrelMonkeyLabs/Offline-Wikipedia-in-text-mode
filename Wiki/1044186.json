 "text": "The flag of Northern Province is the flag of the Northern Provincial Council, which is one of the nine provincial councils of Sri Lanka. It was first used on 22 May 2007. The flag of Eastern Province is used for the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka since 22 May 2007. == History == Provincial Councils were created in Sri Lanka because of an agreement between India and Sri Lanka. The Northern Province and the Eastern Province, which has mostly Tamil-speaking people, were joined together to form a Provincial Council called the North Eastern Provincial Council and it had a flag. In 2007, a Sri Lankan court said that the North and Eastern Province should be separate, so the Northern Provincial Council and the Eastern Provincial Council became two different Provincial Councils. In 2007, two flags were created for the Northern Provincial Council and the Eastern Provincial Council. They were first used at a ceremony at Chief Secretariat in May 2007 in Trincomalee. ==References== Category:Northern Province, Sri Lanka",
