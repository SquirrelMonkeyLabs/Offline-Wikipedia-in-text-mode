 "text": "A neutron moderator is a material that slows down neutrons. This is done in nuclear power stations so the neutrons keep a steady nuclear chain reaction to provide heat. Neutron moderators are an essential part of most nuclear reactors. Common neutron moderators are ordinary water (called light water in the nuclear industry), heavy water, and graphite.
