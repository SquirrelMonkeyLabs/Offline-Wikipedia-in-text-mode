 "text": "A failed state is a political body, usually a state, that can no longer work as it should. There are different definitions, but in general at least one of the following is true: * The state no longer has control over its territory, or it is does not have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. * The ruling people are weak, and cannot enforce collective decisions * Providing public services is difficult * Interacting with other states is difficult, for example, because there is no recognized government In such a state, there often is widespread corruption and there may be civil war (where different factions fight for control). Examples of failed states are Yemen, or Somalia. Metrics have been developed to describe the level of governance of states. The precise level of government control required to avoid being considered a failed state varies considerably amongst authorities. The declaration that a state has \"failed\" is generally controversial and, when made authoritatively, may carry significant geopolitical consequences. == References == Category:States",
