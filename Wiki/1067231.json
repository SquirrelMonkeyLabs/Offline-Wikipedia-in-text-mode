 "text": "The Continental Union Flag, or Grand Union Flag, was the flag for the United States of America when it was still controlled by Britain with the 13 colonies. It is the first flag of the States. It contained 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes with the Union Jack in the top-left corner. The stripes represented the 13 colonies that Britain established. This flag is similar to the American flag of today, however it didnâ€™t have the blue canton with the stars. It was a precursor to the first American flag with 13 stars representing the 13 states.
