The second season aired on Friday nights. The episode format was same as of the first season. This time the season failed to gain TRP ratings. The third season was titled as Aahat: Dahshat Ki Teesri Dastak (English: An approaching sound: The Third Coming of Horror).

But this idea didn't take off; the TRP ratings dropped once again and the channel had to shut down the series on 25 November 2010. To celebrate 15 years of the series, this season featured a 16 - episode arc titled \"Maut Ka Khel\" (English: \"The Game of Death\") which aired starting 20 September 2010.
