 "text": "Mir was a space station created by the Soviet Union and later owned and operated by Russia. It existed from 1984 to 23 March 2001. When it was retired, it moved towards the Earth and burned up in its atmosphere. Mir is now replaced with the International Space Station. It was the first space station to be made out of multiple modules, unlike the previous Salyut series of space stations, which were only made out of one module. Category:Space stations",
