 "text": "Karpathos is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea. It is one of the Greek Dodecanese islands, in the southeastern Aegean. Together with the neighboring smaller Saria Island it forms the municipality of Karpathos. This in turn is part of the Karpathos regional unit. Because of its remote location, Karpathos has preserved many peculiarities of clothing, customs and dialect. The dialect is very similar to that of Crete and Cyprus. The island has also been called Carpathus in Latin, Scarpanto in Italian and Kerpe in Turkish. == References == Category:Islands of Greece",
