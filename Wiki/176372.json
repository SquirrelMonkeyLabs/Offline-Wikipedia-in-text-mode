 "text": "Gateshead F.C. is an association football team who are from North East England. They are an professional club. Their supporters, known as Tynesiders, number in the hundreds. == South Shields to Gateshead == During the early years of the English Football League, South Shields played in the league, finishing as high as sixth in the Second Division. However problems with money saw them move the short distance between to Gateshead. Gateshead became an established team in the Football League's bottom division, coming close to promotion twice. But in 1960, they were controversially voted out of the league, to be replaced by Peterborough United F.C.. The team never really recovered and entered administration in 1974. == Recent History == A successor to Gateshead were soon founded, and attempted to join the Scottish Football League, but they did not get enough votes. This new team also went out of business. But once again, the people of South Shields saved Gateshead and in 1977 the current Gateshead side moved to the town. Gateshead have since moved between the Northern Premier League and the Football Conference. Under Gary Mills, they were able to reach the playoff final but Cambridge beat them to end their hopes of return to the League. Since then a more mellow patch followed. ==Other websites== *Official Gateshead F.C. website Category:English football clubs",
