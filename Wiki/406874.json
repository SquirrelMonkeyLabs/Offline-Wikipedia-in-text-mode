 "text": "The Borgia family (also Borja, Borjia or Borges) were a noble family during the Renaissance in Italy. They were from Valencia, the name coming from the family fief of Borja, then in the kingdom of Aragon, in Spain. The Borgias became influential in religion and politics in the 15th and 16th centuries. Two popes came from this family during this time: Alfons de Borja who ruled as Pope Callixtus III during 1455-1458 and Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia, as Pope Alexander VI, during 1492-1503\\. During the reign of Alexander VI, the Borgias were suspected of many crimes, including adultery, simony, theft, rape, bribery, incest, and murder. They became enemies of the Medici, the Sforza, and the Dominican friar Savonarola, among others. Today they are remembered for their corrupt rule. The name has become a synonym for libertinism, nepotism and treachery. ==Popes== *Pope Callixtus III (1455-1458), born Alfonso de Borja \"Pope Callistus III\", Catholic Encyclopedia; retrieved 2011-11-3. *Pope Alexander VI (1492-1503), born Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia \"Pope Alexander VI\", Catholic Encyclopedia; retrieved 2011-11-3. *Pope Innocent X (1644-1655), born Giovanni Battista Pamphili, \"Pope Innocent X\", Catholic Encyclopedia; retrieved 2011-11-3. the great-great-great-grandson of Pope Alexander VIWoodward, William Harrison.
