 "text": "Light rail or light rail transit (LRT) is a form of urban rail public transportation. The term light rail was created in the early 1970s to refer to more modern types of tram/streetcar services. Generally it can carry fewer people and has a lower speed than heavy rail metro systems, but it can carry more people and has a higher speed than street-running tram systems. The term is normally used to refer to rail systems with some rapid transit-style features that use electric rail cars. Light rail is mostly operating in private rights-of-way separated from other traffic but sometimes, if necessary, mixed with other traffic in city streets. Modern light rail technology is highly flexible in how it can be used, and whether any given system is considered a true rapid transit system or not depends on its implementation. ==Related pages== * Rapid transit * Suburban rail * Tram",
