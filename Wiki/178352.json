 "text": "Riots occurred in Mumbai, India (then called Bombay) in December 1992 and January 1993, in which 900 people died. One of the main causes of the rioting was that Muslims protested against the Demolition of the Babri Masjid, by Hindus, in Ayodhya. Also, the Ayodhya dispute played a role. A mosque was standing on a site that Hindus saw as the birthplace of a deity.
