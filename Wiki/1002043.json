Waldman was born in Millville, New Jersey, in 1945. She grew up on MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village, New York City. When she was young, she met musicians Leadbelly, Pete Seeger, and Thelonious Monk. Later, this had an effect on the place of music in her poetry. She got her BA from Bennington College, Vermont, in 1966. She helped to begin and ran the St. Mark’s Poetry Project from 1966 to 1978. In 1974, she, Allen Ginsberg and others started the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. Waldman has been given many awards, such as the American Book Awards’ Lifetime Achievement Award, the Dylan Thomas Memorial Award, the National Literary Anthology Award, the Shelley Memorial Award for poetry, and grants from the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. ==Books and pamphlets== * The Basketball Article Comic Book, with Bernadette Mayer, illustrated by Jason Novak, Franchise, 2021 * Trickster Feminism, Penguin Books, 2018 * Extinction Aria, Pied Oxen, 2017 * Voice's Daughter of a Heart Yet to be Born, Coffee House Press, 2016 * Dream Book of Fez, The Lune, 2016 * Empty Set, Overpass Books, 2016 * The Iovis Trilogy, Coffee House Press, 2011 * Manatee/Humanity, Penguin Poets, 2009 * Red Noir (performance pieces) Farfalla, McMillen, Parrish, 2007 * Outrider, La Alameda Press, 2006 * Structure of the World Compared to a Bubble, Penguin Poets, 2004. * In the Room of Never Grieve: New & Selected Poems 1985–2003, Coffee House Press, 2003. * Dark Arcana / Afterimage or Glow, Heaven Bone Press, 2003. * [Things] Seen Unseen, 2002. * War Crime, Elik Press, 2002. * Vow to Poetry: Essays, Interviews, & Manifestos, Coffee House Press, 2001. * Marriage: A Sentence, Penguin Poets, 2000. * Iovis II, Coffee House Press, 1997. * Fast Speaking Woman, 20th Anniversary Edition, City Lights Books, 1996. * Kill or Cure, Penguin Poets, 1996. * lovis: All Is Full of Jove, Coffee House Press, 1993. * Troubairitz, Fifth Planet Press, 1993. * Fait Accompli, Last Generation Press, 1992. * Lokapala, Rocky Ledge, 1991. * Not a Male Pseudonym, Tender Buttons Books, 1990. * Helping the Dreamer: New and Selected Poems: 1966–1988, Coffee House Press, 1989. * Tell Me About It, Bloody Twin Press, 1989. * The Romance Thing, Bamberger Books, 1987. * Blue Mosque, United Artists, 1987. * Skin Meat Bones, Coffee House Press, 1985. * Makeup on Empty Space, Toothpaste Press, 1984. * First Baby Poems, Rocky Ledge, 1982, augmented edition, Hyacinth Girls, 1983, republished, BlazeVOX Books, 2008. * Cabin, Z Press, 1981. * Countries, Toothpaste Press, 1980. * To a Young Poet, White Raven, 1979. * Shaman / Shamane, White Raven, 1977. * Hotel Room, Songbird, 1976. * Journals and Dreams, Stonehill, 1976. * Fast Speaking Woman and Other Chants, City Lights, 1975 (revised edition, 1978). * Sun the Blonde Out, Arif, 1975. * Dance Song, No Mountains Poetry Project Broadside Series, 1975 * Fast Speaking Woman, Red Hanrahan Press, 1974. * The Contemplative Life, Alternative Press, c. 1974. * Life Notes: Selected Poems, Bobbs-Merrill, 1973. * The West Indies Poems, Adventures in Poetry, 1972. * Spin Off, Big Sky, 1972. * Light and Shadow, Privately printed, 1972. * Holy City, privately printed, 1971. * No Hassles, Kulchur Foundation, 1971. * Icy Rose, Angel Hair, 1971. * Baby Breakdown, Bobbs-Merrill, 1970. * Giant Night: Selected Poems, Corinth Books, 1970. * Up Through the Years, Angel Hair, 1970. * O My Life!, Angel Hair, 1969. * On the Wing, Boke, 1968. == Related pages == *List of poets from North America ==Reference== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American poets",
