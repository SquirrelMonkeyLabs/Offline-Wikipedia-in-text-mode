 "text": "The WAGR Ms class were a total of 8 successful Garratt steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1913 to 1955. The Ms class were ordered new from Beyer, Peacock & Coy as a superheated version of the standard M class which they built previously in 1911. Superheating improved their steaming qualities making them more favourable with crews for their free-steaming abilities. In 1934 a single M class, No. 389 was converted to a Ms at Midland Railway Workshops. Withdrawals for the class began in 1947 and continued until 1955 when all had been scrapped. == Gallery == File:Ms429 + train, Jarrahdale.jpg|No. 429 at Jarrahdale.
