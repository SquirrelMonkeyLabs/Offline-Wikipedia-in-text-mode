 "text": "Thomas Crapper (baptised 28 September 1836, died 27 January 1910) was an English plumber and businessman. He founded the plumbing equipment company Thomas Crapper & Co in London. Notability of him with regard to toilets has often been too highly stated. This is mainly because of the publication in 1969 of a fictional biography by New Zealand person Wallace Reyburn, who makes funny things. Another way he can be noted is that some say the word crap comes from his name. Actually, it is a Middle Ages origin. The most likely etymological origin of the word crap is a combination of two older words: the Dutch krappen (to pluck off, cut off, or separate) and the Old French crappe (shiftings, waste or rejected matter, from the medieval Latin crappa). == References == Category:1910 deaths Category:Toilets Category:Plumbers Category:Year of birth unknown",
