 "text": "Bangor International Airport is a public use passenger airport. It is 3 miles (5 km) west of the city of Bangor, Maine, United States. It is owned and operated by the City of Bangor. It used to be a military base called Dow Air Force Base. The airport has a single runway that is 11,439 ft (3486 m) long and 200 ft (60 m) wide. The airport is used a lot because it's near the Great Circle Route, a major air route between Europe and the East Coast of the United States. The 'international' in the airport's name doesn't refer to it being close to Canada (to which it has no regular flights), but its role in travel across the Atlantic Ocean. Bangor International Airport has passenger service on three airlines, Delta Airlines, Allegiant Air, and US Airways. ==References== Category:Airports in the United States Category:Bangor, Maine Category:Buildings and structures in Maine Category:Transport in Maine",
