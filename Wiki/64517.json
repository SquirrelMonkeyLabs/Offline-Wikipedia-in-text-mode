 "text": "Naming very small numbers is the same as naming very big numbers, but with one important difference. There is a minus sign over what the 10 in the formula is raised to. So if one wanted to write 0.007 in shorthand form, they would write it 7 x 10−3 since 7 is the third digit after the decimal point (the zero in front of the decimal point does not count). Naming a very small number with lots of different numbers inside it is the same as doing it with a very big number, but again with that one difference of the minus sign. So 0.0000452 would become 4.52 x 10−5 (0.0000452 --> 4.52 x 0.00001 --> 4.52 x 10−5). ==Some examples== 0.00000000009 = 9 x 10−11 0.000678 = 6.78 x 10−4 0.000000535645 = 5.35645 x 10−7 == Names of small numbers == English name European name 100 One One 10−1 Tenth Tenth 10−2 Hundredth Hundredth 10−3 Thousandth Thousandth 10−4 Ten Thousandth Ten Thousandth 10−5 Hundred Thousandth Hundred Thousandth 10−6 Millionth Millionth 10−9 Billionth Milliardth 10−12 Trillionth Billionth 10−15 Quadrillionth Billiardth 10−18 Quintillionth Trillionth 10−21 Sextillionth Trilliardth 10−24 Septillionth Quadrillionth 10-27 Octillionth Quadrilliardth 10-30 Nonillionth Quintillionth 10-33 Decillionth Quintilliardth ==Related pages== *Names of large numbers == Other websites == *Names of large and small numbers category:Numbers",
