 "text": "Fragile Future is the third studio album by Hawthorne Heights. It was released in 2008. It was their first album without Casey Calvert, because he died in late 2007. Casey was the backing vocalist who used death growls in the songs. This album has no death growls or harsh vocals at all because the band decided not to replace Casey with a new person who could do death growls. Hawthorne Heights did not have a lot of success on the singles, but it was seen as a new start for the band. While much of the album was inspired by things that had been happening to the band, it never says the words \"Casey\" or \"Victory Records\" The album art includes a picture of Casey Calvert near a lamppost. ==Track listing== # \"The Business of Paper Stars\" - 3:47 # \"Rescue Me\" - 3:08 # \"Until the Judgement Day\" - 3:45 # \"Somewhere in Between\" - 3:22 # \"Sugar in the Engine\" - 4:29 # \"Desperation\" - 3:28 # \"Four Become One\" - 3:55 # \"321\" - 3:40 # \"Disaster\" - 3:01 # \"Let Go of Everything You Know\" - 3:25 # \"Corps of Corpses\" - 3:12 # \"Come Back Home (Reprised)\" - 4:11 ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:Hawthorne Heights albums",
