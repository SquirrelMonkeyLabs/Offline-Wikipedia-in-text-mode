The movie was filmed in Chicago and Vancouver. Man of Steel was released in theaters on June 14, 2013, in 2D, 3D, and IMAX. The movie had divisive reviews from critics as some people liked the \"darker, more realistic\" retelling of Superman's origin story while others, who were used to a more joyful Superman, did not.
