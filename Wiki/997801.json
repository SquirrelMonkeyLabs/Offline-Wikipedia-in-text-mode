Her parents' names are Garry and Jo Pascoe. She has an older sister named Rebecca. When Pascoe was 2 years old, she was involved in a lawnmower accident. Her father accidentally drove over her leg. Her right left got many scars, and her left leg had to be amputated from the knee down. Sophie struggled to keep up with the other children in her school in swimming. When Sophie was 7 years old, she started one on one swimming lessons. She quickly got better at swimming. Later that year, she beat all her classmates in the school's annual swimming race. Before her grandfather died, she made a promise that one day she would compete in the Paralympics. From the age of 8 until 2022 she was coached by Roly Crichton, an earlier Paralympics gold medalist. She trains at the QEII swim club. == Swimming career == At the age of 15, she qualified for the Beijing Paralympics. She was the youngest team member.
