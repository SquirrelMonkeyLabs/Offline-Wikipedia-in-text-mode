 "text": "Freedom Ship is a proposed seastead and arcology that would endlessly roam the seas. The hull of Freedom Ship would not be an ordinary ship hull, but rather a group of barges. The floating city would have a length of 1800 meters (1989 yards or 5908 feet) and a beam (width) of 250 meters (273 yards or 820ft) with 25 decks (storeys). There would be 50,000 dwelling units, 3,000 commercial units, 2,400 timeshare units and 10,000 hotel rooms, as well as its own subway type system. The ship would be far too big to dock at most ports and thus would have smaller dinghy farries to shuttle passengers to and from shore. Category:Arcology Category:Ships",
