It is next to limestone cliffs along the seafront with a view of Plymouth Sound, Drake's Island, and across the Hamoaze to Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall. The name comes from the Old English word \"hoh\", which means a sloped ridge shaped like an upside-down foot and heel. ==References== Category:Plymouth, Devon Category:Parks in the United Kingdom",
