 "text": "A. Philip Randolph Encyclopædia Britannica (April 15, 1889 – May 16, 1979) was a social activist who fought for labor rights for African-American communities during the 20th century. During World War I, he attempted to unionize African- American shipyard workers and elevator operators and co-launched a magazine designed to encourage demand for higher wages. He later importantly founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which by 1937 would become the first official African-American labor union. In 1942, he received the Spingarn Medal from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. On September 14, 1964, he was awarded Presidential Medal of Freedom by the President Lyndon B. Johnson. == References == Category:1889 births Category:1979 deaths Category:American labor leaders Category:American socialists Category:Democratic socialists Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:People from Jacksonville, Florida Category:Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients",
