 "text": "The Royal Navy is the navy of the United Kingdom. It is the oldest part of the British fighting forces. Because it is the oldest, it is called the \"Senior Service\". From the 18th century until World War II, it was the largest and strongest navy in the world. The Royal Navy was very important in making Britain the superpower of that time. The Naval Service is made up of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Fleet Air Arm and reserve forces. The Naval Service had 57,000 personnel (people) as of November 2011 including part-time reserve sailors, airmen and marines. The Royal Navy is one of the largest navies in the world in terms of gross tonnage (weight and size of all their ships). The Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary have 98 ships including aircraft carriers, submarines, minesweepers and patrol vessels as well as the ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. All ships in the Royal Navy are called \"Her Majesty's ships\" (Or HMS for short), because by constitution the Queen owns them and has command over them. Ships in the Royal Fleet Auxiliary are called \"Royal Fleet Auxiliaries\" (Or RFA for short) and are also technically owned by the Queen. In times of a male monarch the \"Her\" is replaced with \"His\". ==History== The strength of the fleets of the Kingdom of England was an important element in the kingdom's power in the 10th century.Rodger N.A.M. 1997. The safeguard of the Sea - a naval history of Britain - Volume one, 660-1649. At one point, Aethelred II had an especially large fleet built by a national levy of one ship for every 310 hides of land, but it is uncertain whether that was standard or an exceptional model for raising fleets. During the period of Danish rule in the 11th century, a standing fleet was maintained by taxation. That continued for a time under the restored Anglo-Saxon regime of Edward the Confessor, who frequently commanded fleets in person. === 1500–1707 === A permanent Royal Navy, with its own staff, dockyards and a group of purpose-built warships, was created in the 16th century in the reign of Henry VIII.221-37 Under Elizabeth I, England was at war with Spain. Privately owned ships combined with the Royal Navy raided Spanish commerce and colonies.238-53, 281-6, 292-6 In 1588, Philip II of Spain sent the Spanish Armada against England to stop English support for the Dutch rebels, to stop English pirate activity, and to depose Elizabeth. The Spaniards sailed from Lisbon, planning to escort an invasion force from the Spanish Netherlands. The plan failed due to poor planning, English tactics, blocking action by the Dutch, and bad weather.253-71 ==Organisation== In law, the head of the Royal Navy is the monarch or her consort, holding the ceremonial title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom. The Lord High Admiral was Elizabeth II from 1964 to 2011. Her husband Prince Phillip was in the Royal Navy during World War II. He was Lord High Admiral from 2011 to 2021. The professional head of the naval service is the First Sea Lord. He is a member of the Defence Council and the Admiralty Board. The Navy Board is below Admiralty Board and is responsible for running the Navy. Their offices are in the Ministry of Defence, London. Full command of the Royal Navy is the job of Commander-in- Chief Fleet (CINCFLEET). The purpose of CINCFLEET is to provide ships, submarines and commando forces for military and diplomatic jobs as needed by the Government. CINCFLEET command headquarters are in Portsmouth; operational headquarters are at Northwood, Middlesex. This is the Permanent Joint Headquarters and a NATO Regional Command. ===Current Role=== During the Cold War, the Royal Navy mainly focused on hunting for Soviet submarines. These submarines were most active in the North Atlantic Ocean, the ocean near Britain. The main jobs of the Royal Navy are: * Maintenance of the UK Nuclear deterrent through a policy of constant at-sea submarines with nuclear weapons. * Delivery of the UK Commando force * Supplying of assets to the Joint Helicopter Command * Patrol areas the UK is responsible for: ** Atlantic Patrol Task (North) ** Atlantic Patrol Task (South) ** Persian Gulf patrols (Operation Kipion) * Removal of mines * Sea Exploration, weather research and other science projects * Protection of UK fishery limits ===Bases === * HMNB Portsmouth * HMNB Devonport, Plymouth * HMNB Clyde, Faslane ==Personnel== As of 1st November 2011, the Royal Navy numbered 36,640 personnel and 2,300 Royal Naval Reserve (Volunteer Reserve). Both of these figures include the Royal Marines and Royal Marines Reserve. In addition there were 19,600 Regular Reserves. Women have been in the Royal Navy since 1917. From 1939 to 1993 they were part of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) and were called \"Wrens\". Since 1993 they have been a part of the regular Navy. The Royal Navy is an equal rights employer, with women having the same opportunities as their male counterparts. In 2012 for the first time a female officer, Commander Sarah West commanded a major warship, HMS Portland. ==Vessels== This is not a complete list of all Royal Navy vessels.
