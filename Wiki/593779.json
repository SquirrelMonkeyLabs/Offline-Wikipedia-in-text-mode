It was the President of the French Republic, Fran√ßois Hollande, who took the decision to create it and his successor Emmanuel Macron extended it. All the units of the French army but also of the French Air Force and the French Navy participate in Operation Sentinelle. It results in a massive presence of French soldiers in the streets, public places and public transport, in reinforcement of the police and the gendarmerie.
