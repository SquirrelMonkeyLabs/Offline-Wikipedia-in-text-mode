The point of the game is to beat the character(s) you are fighting by knocking them off of the stage. During a match, players can collect orbs that are in a stage. Collecting orbs builds up a power meter that is at the bottom of the screen. When a player is hit, their meter goes down. When the meter is full, the player can use one of three very powerful attacks that can be used to beat opponents and get points. Up to four players can battle with characters from Sony's video games, including God of War, Sly Cooper and PaRappa the Rapper. ===Characters=== Character Series Big Daddy BioShock Cole MacGrath Infamous Colonel Radec Killzone Dante Devil May Cry Emmett Graves Starhawk Evil Cole MacGrath Infamous Fat Princess Fat Princess Heihachi Mishima Tekken Isaac Clarke Dead Space Jak and Daxter Jak and Daxter Kat Gravity Rush Kratos God of War Nariko Heavenly Sword Nathan Drake Uncharted Parappa the Rapper PaRappa the Rapper Raiden Metal Gear Ratchet and Clank Ratchet & Clank Sackboy LittleBigPlanet Sir Daniel Fortesque MediEvil Sly Cooper Sly Cooper Spike Ape Escape Sweet Tooth Twisted Metal Toro Inoue Toro Zeus God of War ;Notes : These characters can be downloaded for free from the PlayStation Store.
