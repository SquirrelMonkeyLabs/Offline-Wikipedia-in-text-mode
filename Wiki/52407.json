 "text": "Tiridates III (or Trdat III) was the king of Armenia (286-330), and was also known as Tiridates the Great. (Some scholars may be wrong because they call him as Trdat IV as a result of the fact that Tiridates I of Armenia reigned twice.) In 301, Tiridates made Christianity as the sole religion in Armenia, making Armenia the first Christian state in the world. == References == *Translated from the Armenian: Mihran Kurdoghlian, Badmoutioun Hayots, A. hador [Armenian History, volume I], Athens, Greece, 1994, pg. 96-105. *The Library of Congress - Armenia - A Country Study *Yuri Babayan - Tiridates the Great Category:Monarchs of Armenia Category:286 births Category:330 deaths Category:4th-century Armenian people",
