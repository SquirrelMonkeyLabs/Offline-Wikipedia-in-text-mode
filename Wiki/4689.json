 "text": "In astronomy, voids are the empty spaces between filaments. Filaments and voids are the largest-scale structures in the Universe. There are no or few galaxies in voids. Most voids have a diameter of 11 to 150 Mpc. Especially large voids are the empty spaces without many superclusters. These voids are sometimes called supervoids. A 1994 official counting lists a total of 27 supervoids with a distance of up to 740 Mpc.Lindner U, J. Einasto, M. Einasto, W. Freudling, K. Fricke, E. Tago. 1995. The structure of supervoids. I.
