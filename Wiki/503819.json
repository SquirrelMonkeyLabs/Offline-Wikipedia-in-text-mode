 "text": "The Dodge Charger is an American full-size car. They are marketed through the Dodge division of Chrysler. Several different vehicles built with three different chassis have the Charger name. == History == Notable years in Charger history are: === 1966 through 1968 === The Dodge Charger first premiered with the 1966 models. Dodge added a fastback roof on their Coronet (B-body). Inside there were four bucket seats with a full-length console. Engines included the 318 CID (Cubic Inch Displacement), the 361 CID, the 383 CID and a 426 Chrysler Hemi Engine. Transmissions included a three-speed manual, a four-speed manual, and a Torqueflite automatic. In 1968, the Charger was restyled to improve sales, though they continued to go down. === 1975 through 1983 === Dodge introduced the Charger SE in 1975. It was a clone of the Chrysler Cordoba. Like the Cordoba, it was a luxury car. The base engine was the 360 CID. The 318 CID and the 400 CID engines were optional. A new Charger Daytona model was available with larger tires, having no resemblance to the NASCAR Daytona Charger. In 1975, Dodge Chargers won 14 NASCAR Grand National races, being done in 1974 Chargers. In 1978, Chrysler was facing financial troubles. Lee Iacocca turned Chrysler around, and by 1983, the company was making money again.Charles K. Hyde, Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2003), p. 233 === 2006 to 2014 === The Dodge Charger was reintroduced in 2006. The new Charger is a four-door sedan. It rode on the new rear-wheel drive LX platform, sharing similarities with the Chrysler 300. In 2011 the next generation was launched. The styling of the 2011 was like the late 1960s muscle car Chargers. The Pentastar 3.6-liter V6 was the base engine. The 292 Hp V6 engine got 21 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway using an 8-speed automatic transmission. The combination moved the Charger from 0 to 60 mph in 6.6 seconds. It was available in rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. == References == Category:1960s automobiles Category:1970s automobiles Category:1980s automobiles Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles",
