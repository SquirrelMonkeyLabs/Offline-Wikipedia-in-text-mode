 "text": "The Knowledge Graph (also known as Knowledge Panel) is a feature in the Google search engine. A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a model in which networks and knowledge structures can be mapped. By linking objects that are related to each other, data can be visualized easily and new knowledge can possibly be formed. It gets information from several sources, like the CIA World Factbook, Wikidata, and Wikipedia. It is used to show important information and pictures about a person, group, or subject. The Knowledge Graph was added to Google in 2012. After that, lots of Knowledge Graphs were created. Google says that Knowledge Graphs answer about one third of all Google searches. Some people do not like the Knowledge Graph because it does not cite any sources. Information from the Knowledge Graph is used to answer spoken questions in Google Assistant and Google Home voice queries. == References == Category:Google",
