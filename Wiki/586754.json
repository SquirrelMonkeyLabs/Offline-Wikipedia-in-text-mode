The attack began when a white van rammed pedestrians on London Bridge. The van drove on and stopped south of the bridge. Three men left the van and ran to Borough Market, where stabbing attacks took place in restaurants. One witness reported that the attackers shouted \"This is for Allah\" and stabbed customers with knives. Ten people (including three attackers) were killed and 48 injured in the attack. Three suspects wearing fake explosive vests were shot dead by police. The Metropolitan Police declared the London Bridge and Borough Market attacks to be \"terrorist incidents\". On 4 June, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd said, \"We are confident about the fact that they were radical Islamic terrorists, the way they were inspired, and we need to find out more about where this radicalisation came from.\" On 5 June, two of the attackers were identified as Khuram Shazad Butt and Rachid Redouane. The third of the three attackers, Youssef Zaghba was identified the following day. ==Related pages== *2019 London Bridge stabbing ==References== June 2017 attack June 2017 attack Category:2017 murders in the United Kingdom Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2017 Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom Category:June 2017 events Category:Mass murder in 2017 June 2017 attack Category:Mass stabbings in Europe Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2017 June 2017 attack Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in the 2010s Category:Terrorist incidents involving vehicular attacks",
