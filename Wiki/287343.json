 "text": "A trace element is present in only a small amount. The amount depends on context. * In analytical chemistry, it is an element in a sample that has an average concentration of less than 100 parts per million (ppm) measured in atomic count, or less than 100 micrograms per gram. * In biochemistry, it is one that is needed in minute quantities for the proper growth, development, and physiology of the organism.H.J.M. Bowen 1976. Trace elements in biochemistry. 2nd ed, Academic Press. In biochemistry, a trace element is also referred to as a micronutrient. See Cofactor. *In geology, its concentration is less than 1000 ppm or 0.1% of a rock's composition. The term is used mainly in igneous petrology. == References == Category:Biochemistry Category:Geology",
