 "text": "A Jejemon (tl: ) is a type of person in the Philippines who makes the English language hard to read. The Philippine Daily Inquirer call them different but happy because of their language and clothes. The word Jejemon came from people who like to write \"hehehe\" as \"jejeje\" because \"jeje\" is Spanish for hehe due to the sound J makes in Spanish. \"-Mon\" is added at the end. This is from the Japanese anime Pok√©mon. \"-Mon\" means \"monster.\" They are \"jeje-monsters.\" ==People== Jejemons started to appear because of cellphones. Cellphones can only use 160 characters so people who use them write shorter words to save space. Jejemons don't want this so they made their words longer. People who are Jejemons are described based on levels. These are \"mild,\" \"moderate\", \"severe\", or \"terminal.\"Tagalog ==Jejenese and Jejebet== Jejemons speak Jejenese based on Taglish and Englog. Jejenese is also referred to as \"street language\". Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on Leet. Words are created by mixing letters in a word, mixed large and small letters, using the letters H, X or Z many times, and mixing of numbers in words. The spelling is the same as Leetspeak. ===Examples=== English Tagalog Jejenese I would like to know more about you, care to tell me your name? Hehehehe!

Celebrities have condemned some attacks. Jejebusters were created to fight jejetyping and jejemons.
