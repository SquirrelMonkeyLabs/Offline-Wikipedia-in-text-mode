 "text": "A diagram is usually a two-dimensional display which communicates using visual relationships. It is a simplified and structured visual representation of concepts, ideas, constructions, relations, statistical data, anatomy etc. It may be used for all aspects of human activities to explain or illustrate a topic. == Discussion == * visual information device: Like the term \"illustration\" the diagram is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including graphs, technical drawings and tables.Brasseur, Lee E. 2003. Visualizing technical information: a cultural critique. Amityville, N.Y: Baywood Pub. * specific kind of visual display: This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links. In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: \"diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and maps, line graphs, bar charts, engineering blueprints, and architects' sketches are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not\".Michael Anderson (1997). \"Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning\" . Retrieved 21 July 2008. On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically \"abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent\". == Visual thinking == Diagrams affect the mind so that the viewer comes to understand them, but not in the way one understands words. Visual thinking or problem-solving is very ancient, and largely automatic. One only has to remember that the brain puts together an image of the world around us based on sensory input, mostly sight. We do not make any conscious decisions: it is done without conscious thought. Diagrams most likely \"tap in\" to some of these ancient – but largely unknown – routines. In fact these normally hidden brain processes do sometimes become apparent. When brain damage affects the visual cortex,Christine Roman-Lantzy 2007. Cortical visual impairment. New York: AFB Press. or when visual illusions are created,Gregory R.L. 1970. The intelligent eye. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London.Gregory, Richard 1997. Knowledge in perception and illusion. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 352:1121-1128. (pdf) are two classic examples. The way some diagrams affect thinking is quite important. Mendeleev's periodic table summarised previous research on the elements. Far more important, though, was the way it suggested the properties of elements which were not yet discovered.Mendeleev, Dmitry Ivanovich; Jensen, William B. (ed) 2005. Mendeleev on the periodic law: selected writings, 1869–1905. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications. This diagram stimulated creative thought, and other examples from the history of science could be given: see Feynman diagram. == Basic diagram types == * Matrix * Set * Network diagram * Flowchart * Tree diagram * Graph * Exploded view == Examples == * Circuit diagram * Euler diagram * Family tree * Feynman diagram * Gantt chart – shows the timing of tasks or activities (used in project management) * Mind map – used for learning, brainstorming, memory, visual thinking and problem solving * Organisation * Piping and instrumentation diagram * Venn diagram == Some main diagram types == There are at least the following types of diagrams: * Graph- based diagrams: relationships are expressed as connections between the items or overlaps between the items; examples: File:Tree Example.png|tree diagram File:LampFlowchart.svg|flowchart File:Set intersection.svg|Venn diagram * Chart-like diagram techniques, which display a relationship between two variables that take either discrete or a continuous ranges of values; examples: File:Histogram example.svg|histogram File:Zusammensetzung Shampoo.svg|pie chart File:Hyperbolic Cosine.svg|function graph File:R-car stopping distances 1920.svg|scatter plot Schematics and other types of diagrams, e.g., File:Train schedule of Sanin Line, Japan, 1949-09-15, part.png|train diagram File:Gear pump exploded.svg|exploded view File:US 2000 census population density map by state.svg|population density map File:Automotive diagrams 01 En.png|Three-dimensional diagram == References == Category:Non-verbal communication",
