 "text": "The Pro-Administration Party was a political faction in the early years of the United States, emerging around the time of George Washington's presidency (1789–1797). It was not a political party in the modern sense, but rather a coalition of individuals and groups who supported Washington's administration and its policies. The term \"Pro-Administration\" is often used to describe those who were generally in favor of the policies put forward by Washington and his key advisors, particularly Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. In fact, the period of Washington's presidency marked a time when political factions began to take shape, even though organized political parties had not yet emerged. \"After the passage and ratification of the Constitution and subsequent Bill of Rights, the Legislative Branch began to resemble what it is today. While organized political parties were nonexistent during the presidency of George Washington, informal factions formed between congressmen that were either ‘Pro-Administration’ or ‘Anti-Administration’. After George Washington stepped down as President, the informal coalitions in Congress became officially organized, transforming the ‘Pro-Administration’ faction into the Federalist Party and the ‘Anti-Administration’ faction into the Jeffersonian Party\" more known as the \"Democratic-Republicans or Anti- Federalists\" (The Federalist Party.” American Battlefield Trust, www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/federalist-party). Thus, the Pro- Administration faction became the cornerstone of America's political system, laying the foundation for the Federalist Party and marking the dawn of a new, independent nation.
