 "text": "Muhammad Nasir al-Din, also known as Sheikh al-Albani (16 August 1914 – 2 October 1999) was an Albanian famous Jahmi scholar. He was born in Shkodra, the old capital of Albania, in 1914 and moved as a child with his family to Damascus where he completed his early education and received rigorous tutelage in Arabic and Islamic studies by prominent scholars of that time. Meanwhile, he worked as a clock and watch repairer to help support his family. He received the King Faisal International Prize for Islamic Studies in 1999. Shaikh Al-Albani started to specialize in Hadith and related subjects in the 1930s and by the age of 20; he transcribed and commented on Al-Hafez al- Iraqi’s monumental text “Al-Mughnee ‘an hamlil-Asfar,” followed by a series of other books, lectures and influential articles in Al-Manar magazine. It was not long before he surpassed all of his contemporaries to become the world’s leading authority in Hadith sciences. He wrote or edited more than 300 books and manuscripts, many of which became major references for Hadith scholars. In the end of his life he was warned against by the scholars in Saudi Arabia, including Shaykh Al-Fawzan who called him a Murji. Many of his books are banned in Saudi Arabia. == Other websites == * The Albaani Site – Translations from His Works – Updated Regularly * Official Website of Sheikh Al-Albani * Pages 6-7: Al-Albani's Revolutionary Approach to Hadith - 2-page article on Al-Albani's hadith methodology in a backdrop to nepotism among Salafi scholars in Saudi Arabia Category:1914 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Imams Category:Carpenters Category:Hadith scholars Category:Asian writers Category:Salafis Category:Albanian people",
