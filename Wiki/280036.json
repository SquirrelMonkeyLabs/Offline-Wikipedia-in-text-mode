 "text": "Titanosaurus meaning 'titanic lizard' - named after the mythological 'Titans', deities of Ancient Greece was a genus of sauropod dinosaur, first described by Lydekker in 1877 from fragments, but not confirmed by later research.Lydekker R. 1877. Notices of new and other vertebrata from Indian tertiary and secondary rocks. Records of the Geological Survey of India, 10(1): 30-43. Titanosaurus was 9-12 metres (30-40 ft) long and weighed about 13 tons. Titanosaurus has traditionally been treated as a \"wastebasket taxon\" for poorly preserved sauropod remains. The most well-known species of Titanosaurus, \"Titanosaurus\" colberti, has been renamed Isisaurus. The remains were from the Upper Cretaceous of India. == Notes == category:Cretaceous dinosaurs category:Titanosaurs",
