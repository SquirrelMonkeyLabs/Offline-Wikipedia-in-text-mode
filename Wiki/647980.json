 "text": "Hage Gottfried Geingob (3 August 1941 â€“ 4 February 2024) was a Namibian politician. He was the third President of Namibia from 21 March 2015 until his death on 4 February 2024. Geingob was the first Prime Minister of Namibia from 21 March 1990 to 28 August 2002 and again from 4 December 2012 to 21 March 2015. == Election == Again candidate in the presidential election of November 2019, Geingob is reelected with 56.3% of the votes cast, down from 86% he had obtained five years ago. Panduleni Itula, dissident candidate of Swapo, head of the Landless Movement (LPM) of Bernadus Swartbooi gets 30% of the vote. Opposition leader McHenry Venaani of the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), formerly close to South Africa's apartheid, won 5.3 percent of the vote. The Swapo thus obtains 65% of the seats in the National Assembly, failing to obtain a two-thirds majority as in the previous legislature. Geingob is considered a populist in Namibia. ==Death== On 8 January 2024, Geingob announced that he was diagnosed again with prostate cancer after a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy. He went for treatment in the United States on 25 January and returned to Namibia on 30 January following two days of treatment. On 4 February 2024, Vice President Nangolo Mbumba announced that Geingob had died at a hospital in Windhoek, where he had been receiving treatment, aged 82. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Prime ministers of Namibia Category:Presidents of Namibia Category:Deaths from prostate cancer",
