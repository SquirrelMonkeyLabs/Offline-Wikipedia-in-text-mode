 "text": "The Meta Quest 3 is a virtual reality (VR) headset developed by Meta Platforms. It was announced on June 1, 2023, and released on October 10, 2024. The Quest 3 is the third generation of the Meta Quest line. == Release == When it released, the headset received positive reviews, with critics mentioning its thinner build and performance improvements over the Quest 2, but some negativity because of its passthrough cameras for their clarity and a relative lack of MR experiences at launch, and its relatively unchanged system software. == Hardware == The Meta Quest 3 includes twice as much RAM than on the Quest 2 (12GB vs 6GB), as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 CPU which is said to have \"twice the processing power of the Quest 2\", by Meta. === Controllers and tracking === The Quest 3 also has updated controllers, called the Touch Plus controllers. Meta has put the IR sensors in the faceplate of the controller, meaning they removed the tracking ring of the original Touch controllers. These controllers has improved haptics. There are 4 tracking cameras in the Quest 3, placed in different spots than the Quest 2's cameras, so the tracking area is different and much larger. === Lenses === The Meta Quest 3 includes pancake lenses instead of the fresnel lenses found in the Quest 2, making the headset \"40% slimmer than the Quest 2\". The lens are 2068 x 2204 px (1440i), instead of the 1920 x 1832 (1080i) found in the Quest 2. == Software == The Meta Quest 2 uses Meta Horizon OS as its system software. === Passthrough === One of the biggest changes is the color passthrough (instead of the black-and-white passthrough found in the Quest 2). Passthrough is a feature that lets the person using the headset be able to see their surroundings. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Technology Category:Virtual reality",
