Two of its supporters said: \"By having a fair tax code, by building a strong American economy, and by bringing our troops home, we achieve a budget surplus of over $30 billion by 2021 and we end up with a debt that is less than 65% of our GDP. This is what sustainability looks like\". == Electoral results == === Senate === Election year Overall seats Democratic seats Independent seats ± 2010 2012 −1 2014 — 2016 — 2018 — === House of Representatives === Election year Overall seats Democratic seats ± 2010 2012 −9 2014 — 2016 +10 2018 +17 == Membership == All members are members of the Democratic Party or caucus with the Democratic Party.
