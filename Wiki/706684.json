FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) was enacted in 2010, under the Obama administration. The agreement with Canada was concluded in February 2014 when Stephen Harper was Prime Minister of Canada. Americans include, for the purpose of this agreement, \"accidental Americans\", their non-American families and business partners, and former non-American residents of the United States.FATCA tax deal with U.S. takes some heat off Canadian banks | CBC News Many other countries have signed similar FATCA agreements with the United States.
