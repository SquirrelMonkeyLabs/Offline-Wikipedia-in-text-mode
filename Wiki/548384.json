 "text": "Bloeme Evers-Emden (; 26 July 1927 - 18 July 2016) was a Jewish-Dutch academic and child psychologist. She researched the phenomenon of \"hidden children\" during World War II and wrote four books on the subject in the 1990s. Her interest in the topic grew out of her own experiences during World War II, when she was forced to go into hiding from the Nazis and was arrested and deported to Auschwitz on the last transport leaving the Westerbork transit camp on 3 September 1944. Together with her on the train were Anne Frank and her family, whom she had known in Amsterdam. She was freed on 8 May 1945. She wrote columns for the Jewish weekly Nieuw IsraÃ«lietisch Weekblad. == References == *Portrait of Bloeme Emden with a Jewish star, circa 1942 *Oral history interview with Bloeme Evers-Emden (1999) at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Category:1927 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Dutch academics Category:Dutch columnists Category:Dutch Jews Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Jewish academics Category:Jewish scientists Category:Jewish writers Category:Dutch psychologists Category:Writers from Amsterdam",
