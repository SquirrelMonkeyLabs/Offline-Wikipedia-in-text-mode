 "text": "ARSAT is a telecommunications company of Argentina that provides data transmission, telephone and television services through terrestrial, air and space infrastructure. Its facilities are located in Benavídez, Buenos Aires province. From there, it operates the services offered by the geostationary satellites ARSAT-1, ARSAT-2, and SES-14, the Federal Fiber Optic Network, the National Data Center, and provides technical support for Argentine Digital Terrestrial Television services. ==Overview== The private, foreign-owned company Nahuelsat SA managed the orbital slots awarded to the country by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) since 1997. However, since the company had failed to launch the Nahuel II satellite into space, these breaches would have resulted in the revocation of the allocation, leaving the country without any satellite slots. After Néstor Kirchner took office, the government requested an extension, which was granted by the ITU. However, Nahuelsat declared bankruptcy, entered into a tender process, and liquidated its assets. Alternatively, in 2004, the government requested a third extension to establish a replacement company, a publicly held corporation, Empresa Argentina de Soluciones Satelitales S.A. (ARSAT). == References ==",
