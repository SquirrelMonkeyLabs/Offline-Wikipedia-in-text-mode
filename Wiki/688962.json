 "text": "The Sukharev Tower (Сухарева башня) was a building in the center of Moscow, Russia. It was built from 1692 to 1701 by the architect Mikhail Chugolokov Ivanovich. It was destroyed in 1934. The Soviet government of Stalin destroyed it to make Garden Avenue in Moscow. When the building was first opened, it was designed to be a kind of Triumphal Gate In honor of the Tsar, he renounced his war against his sister Sophia Alexeyevna Romanova on the throne. The tower was named in honor of Lorenti Pankerevich Soharb who was the commander of the army. The School of Mathematics and Navigation of Moscow used the tower until 1921. Then it became the Moscow City Hall where it also housed: \"Moscow History Museum.\" Finally, it was destroyed in 1934 for the construction of The Garden Ring Although there were many objections to its destruction among the public and among many Russian architects. The tower was built in the Baroque Narishkin style. Category:Buildings and structures in Moscow Category:Towers in Europe Category:18th-century buildings and structures",
