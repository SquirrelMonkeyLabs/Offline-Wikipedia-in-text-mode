ISBN 1-85227-679-7 Each of the actors played several stock characters, a regular pattern in radio and theatrical comedy. By \"stock characters\" is meant characters whose idiosyncracies (peculiaririties) is well understood by the listening audience. This was also a feature of much music hall entertainment.\"Music hall\" is Britspeak for vaudeville. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. Some of the later episodes had electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Many of these ideas were reused by other shows for decades. Elements of the show satirised life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and films.Wilmut, Roger; Jimmy Grafton 1976.

The Goon Show had an influence on the later BBC television series Monty Python. Both were absurdist comedies. == References == Category:Radio programs Category:BBC radio Category:Comedy Category:1951 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1960s disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:1960 disestablishments",
