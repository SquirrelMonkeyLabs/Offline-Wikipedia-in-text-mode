In order to resolve this issue, the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the country's leading educational institutions.[1] [2] == History == === Geographical History === The site of the PLM campus at Intramuros used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila (also known as Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio), which was founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio Sedeño, S.J.Cruz, Roman Jr. A. \"The Ateneo Story.\" Aegis. 1959. The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595, and was the first school in the Philippines.\"Geographical History \".

The Intramuros website. Accessed February 19, 2009. Iglesia de Santa Ana, the first stone church in the Philippines, was built in 1590 and opened in 1596. However, an earthquake destroyed it, and another church was built in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1626. In 1601, the Colegio de San José was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university.Horacio de la Costa, S.J. The Jesuits in the Philippines. In 1623, Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia.Roman A. Cruz, Jr. \"The Ateneo Story.\" Aegis. 1959Horacio de la Costa, S.J. Light Cavalry. In 1722, the Colegio de San José was granted royal patronage. In 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories. Later, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Santo Tomas. The Colegio de San José is now the San José Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University. The buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, which eventually became known as Cuartel de España. José Rizal was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26, 1896. During the American occupation, part of the barracks was razed, and a gymnasium was built on it. In early 1930s, one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym. The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941. During World War II, General Douglas McArthur held command post here, but the entire area was later destroyed by the ongoing military conflict.Manila High School History . Manila High School Alumni Portal. Accessed February 19, 2009. In early 1960s, the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School. On April 24, 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392-A, giving to the proposed city university the three-hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School. On February 26, 1967, the new complex along Victoria Street was opened, and the students of Manila High School were transferred there. On July 17, 1967, the first group of PLM scholars began studying on the site where the modern educational system in the Philippines started. === Founding === The call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13, 1960. The ordinance allotted a total of PhP 1,000,000 for the construction of the university. Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack.Goco, Raul Ilustre. \"Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila: 42 years of existence \". The Philippine Star. July 14, 2007. Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacson's plan. He later issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university. He sought the help of Congressman Justo R. Albert, representative of the City's fourth congressional district. Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No. 8349 at the Philippines' House of Representatives. The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias. The two bills were eventually combined into one, and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25, 1965. The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress. On June 19, 1965, the final bill with the title - \"An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes\" - was signed into law by President Diosdado P. Macapacal in a signing ceremony at Malacañang Palace. The law was captioned as Republic Act No. 4196, which now serves as the University Charter. === Early years === With an enrollment of 556 students—both men and women—PLM opened for classes on July 17, 1967. All of them were housed under the University College, which offered liberal arts courses. After a year, a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded, and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies. At the turn of the decade, the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication, engineering, education, business administration, nursing. == Footnotes == Category:University of the City of Manila Category:Colleges and universities in Manila",
