He was the son of Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Amalia of Austria. ==Marriage and death== ===Marriage=== Maximilian III married Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony in 1747 at the age of 20. But, they had no children. So it lead to the War of the Bavarian Succession. ===Death=== In December 1777 Maximilian Joseph rode in his carriage through Munich; on the ride, as he passed one of the tower clocks, the mechanism broke, and the clock struck 77 times. Commenting to the passengers, Maximilian Joseph decided this was an omen, and that his years had run out. Within days, he was stricken with a strange disease. None of his 15 doctors could diagnose it, but by Christmas, it had become clear that it was a particularly virulent strain of smallpox, called \"purple small pox\" at the time.Paul Bernard.
