 "text": "Next Generation was an American monthly video game magazine. It ran from January 1995 until January 2002. The magazine was produced in Brisbane, California. The first issue, released in January 1995, spotlighted the gaming industry and featured the 3DO, Atari Jaguar, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64. Unlike a lot of other video game magazines, Next Generation would mainly focus on the gaming industry and consoles rather than on singular games. The last issue was in January 2002, with the main feature being a review of the recently released Xbox console and it's lineup of games. ==References== Category:1995 establishments in California Category:2002 disestablishments Category:American monthly magazines Category:Video game magazines",
