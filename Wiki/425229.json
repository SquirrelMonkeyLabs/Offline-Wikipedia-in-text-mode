 "text": "A zine is a photocopied newspaper, or magazine, about music or politics. Zines are small circulation, non-commercial publications that are printed by their creators on a topic of their choice. They come in all shapes and sizes from personal zine, artzines, zines about music and politics, fanzines. Zines are straight from the writer to the reader: raw, uncut and handmade. Zines are usually photocopied by hand, and made by amateurs who do not have training in journalism. Only a small number of copies of a zine are usually made. Zines are often sold at record stores. A music zine might include reviews of line music shows, interviews with bands, and advertisements for CDs. Zines were an important part of the punk rock and hardcore punk subcultures.
