 "text": "The WAGR Cs class were a total of 16 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1929 to 1961. The Cs class were the result of superheating standard C class locomotives from 1929 to 1949. The Cs class turned out to be a success hence why conversions continued until the late 1940s. Withdrawals started in the 1950s with the arrival of the W class, by 1961 all had been withdrawn, with the last scrapped in 1964 at Subiaco.
