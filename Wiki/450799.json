 "text": "Johnny Ekström (born 5 March 1965) is a former Swedish footballer. He is most known for his time at IFK Göteborg. He became both a Swedish and German champion, with Bayern Munich and IFK Göteborg. He was also a fan-favorite at Italian team Empoli F.C. There he received the Italian nickname of \"Il Ciclone\" (The Cyclone) because of his quickness while dribbling the ball. Ekström also played for the Sweden national team and took part in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. His nicknames in Sweden include \"Kallebäcks-Expressen\" (the express train from Kallebäck) and \"Johnny Bråttom\" (Johnny in a Hurry), named after his speed. He played for IFK Göteborg when he was a child, and made his way to the senior squad quickly. He often went back to IFK Göteborg years later. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish footballers Category:1990 FIFA World Cup players",
