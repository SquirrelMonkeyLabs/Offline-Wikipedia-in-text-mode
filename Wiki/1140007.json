 "text": "The Plymouth Colony originated as a land grant issued by the London Virginia Company to a group of English separatist Puritans who had fled to Holland to avoid religious persecution. Their migration to the New World in 1620 aboard the Mayflower was funded by the Merchant Adventurers, who sent additional settlers to engage in profit-making activities in the colony.Hart, p. 1:67 The settlers had intended to establish a colony near the mouth of the Hudson River, within the bounds of the London Virginia Company's territory, but weather conditions on their arrival led them to establish it instead on the shores of Cape Cod Bay at Plymouth, Massachusetts.Hart, p. 1:69 The colonists acquired a land grant from the Plymouth Council for New England in 1621,Hart, p. 1:72 but its early governance took place under the terms of the Mayflower Compact, a document which the colonists drafted and signed aboard the Mayflower before they landed. In 1630, the colony acquired a formal charter with authority to govern from the Plymouth Council, but it was unsuccessful in attempts to acquire a royal charter that would guarantee its territory against other claimants. # Governor Took office Left office Deputy governor 1st John Carver November 11, 1620 died April 15, 1621Moore, p. 46 The colony had no deputy governors until 1681; the governor named a pro tem governor when he was absent. 2nd William Bradford May 1621 January 1, 1633 3rd Edward Winslow January 1, 1633 March 27, 1634 4th Thomas Prence March 27, 1634 March 3, 1635 5th William Bradford March 3, 1635 March 1, 1636 6th Edward Winslow March 1, 1636 March 7, 1637 7th William Bradford March 7, 1637 June 5, 1638 8th Thomas Prence June 5, 1638 June 3, 1639 9th William Bradford June 3, 1639 June 5, 1644 10th Edward Winslow June 5, 1644 June 4, 1645 11th William Bradford June 4, 1645 died May 9, 1657Moore, p. 79 12th Thomas Prence June 3, 1657 June 3, 1673 13th Josiah Winslow June 3, 1673 December 18, 1680 14th Thomas Hinckley December 18, 1680 1686 James Cudworth (1681–82) William Bradford the Younger (1682–86) Dominion of New England 1686 1689 Not applicable 15th Thomas Hinckley 1689 1692 William Bradford the Younger (1689–92) Source unless otherwise cited: Gifford et al., p. 205; Capen, p. 53 ==References== Category:Plymouth Colony",
