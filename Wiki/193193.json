 "text": "A Panzerfaust is a recoilless rifle that was invented by Germany. A Panzerfaust can only be used once unlike the Panzerschreck or the Bazooka. The Panzerfaust was used heavily late in World War II, especially during the Battle of Berlin. They were made in very large numbers. They were less powerful than later Rocket-propelled grenades.
