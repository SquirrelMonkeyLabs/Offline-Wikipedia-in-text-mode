It can live in grassy places with small, woody plants, forests that have been cut down and are growing back, and places near water. Scientists do not know if this frog can live in places that human beings have changed. Scientists saw this frog between 450 and 1120 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in one protected park: Reserva Forestal Nacional Vanguardia. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms and to make places for human beings to live. Bad chemicals in the water can also hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
