He became a priest on 19 April 1973. == Career == In 1998, Pope John Paul II made him the Bishop of Tarnów. In 2011, he became the Archbishop of Katowice. == Controversies == In 2002, Bishop Skworc handled a case involving a priest named Stanisław P. This priest was accused of sexually abusing children. Bishop Skworc removed him from his position and sent him on leave. Later, he sent the priest to work in Ukraine. He did not inform the Vatican or the police. The priest abused more children in Ukraine. When he returned in 2008, Bishop Skworc gave him a job in Krynica-Zdrój, where he worked with children again. In 2010, after more accusations, the bishop suspended (he could not perform his duties as a priest) the priest and banned him from working with children. In 2013, the Vatican found the priest guilty and punished him. Bishop Skworc asked the Archbishop of Kraków to investigate his actions. In 2021, the Vatican finished the investigation and found Bishop Skworc had made mistakes. He asked for a coadjutor bishop (an auxiliary bishop with the right to succeed him) and gave up some of his roles. Skworc resigned in May 2023. In December 2021, Pope Francis appointed Adrian Galbas as the coadjutor bishop. == References == == Other websites == * Archdiocese of Katowice Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Polish Roman Catholic bishops Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals",
