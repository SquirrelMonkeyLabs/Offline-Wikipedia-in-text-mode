 "text": "\"You Are the Girl\" is a 1987 song by The Cars, from their album Door to Door. It was released as a single in August 1987, reaching number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number 2 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart. It was the thirteenth and (as of 2010) last Top 40 hit for The Cars. ==Details== Rhythm guitarist and primary songwriter Ric Ocasek shares lead vocals with bassist Benjamin Orr on \"You Are the Girl\". Both singers had recently hit the Top 40 with solo hits, Ocasek with 1986's \"Emotion in Motion\" and Orr with 1987's \"Stay the Night\". The song was recorded during sessions for the band's last studio album, 1987's Door to Door, during a time of personal conflict between the band members. Following the album's release, there was public speculation that the band was breaking up, and within a year The Cars announced that they had disbanded. \"You Are the Girl\" was The Cars' last Top 40 hit, although two more singles released from Door to Door reached the Top 100: 1987's \"Strap Me In\" (number 85) and 1988's \"Coming Up You\" (number 74). ==References== Category:The Cars songs Category:1987 songs",
