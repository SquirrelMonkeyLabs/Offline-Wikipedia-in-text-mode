Tannehill started his first pro career game. He played poorly, throwing 0 touchdowns and 3 interceptions against the Houston Texans. Even though he had a poor first game, Tannehill showed signs of growth throughout his rookie season. Despite playing better as the season progressed, his play was still thought to be overall mediocre, as it was overshadowed by the play of other rookie quarterbacks, such as Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, and Russell Wilson. ==References== == Other websites == *Texas A&M; bio *ESPN player profile and stats Category:Miami Dolphins players Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Texas Category:People from Lubbock, Texas Category:Tennessee Titans players",
