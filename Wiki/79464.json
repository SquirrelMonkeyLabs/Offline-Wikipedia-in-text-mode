 "text": "A relay race is a track and field event in which athletes run a pre-set distance carrying a baton before passing it onto the next runner. Often, a relay team is a team of four sprinters. In athletics, the two standard relays are the 4x100 meter relay and the 4x400 meter relay. Traditionally, the 4x400 meter relay finals are the last event of a track meet. Nowadays, long distance relays have become increasingly popular with runners of all skill-levels. These runners typically have 5 to 36 legs, each between 5 and 10 kilometers (3-6 miles) long. ==Related pages== * Middle distance race * Long distance race * Walking race * Hurdle race * Sprint * Steeplechase * Cross-country race * Marathon Category:Running",
