The Titan's Curse is the third novel in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. It is the next book after The Sea of Monsters. The book tells the story of the adventures of the fourteen-year-old demigod Percy Jackson as he and his friends go on a dangerous adventure. In this quest, they have to rescue his friend Annabeth and the Greek goddess Artemis, who have both been kidnapped. The Titan's Curse received good reviews. It was nominated for many awards. The book was also the number one The New York Times children's series best seller and Book Sense Top Ten Summer Pick for 2007. It was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on May 1, 2007. The novel was also released in audiobook format. Actor Jesse Bernstein read the audiobook. It is followed by The Battle of the Labyrinth, which is the fourth book in the series. ==Plot== Like the other books in the series, The Titan's Curse is of the fantasy genre. It uses the ancient Greek mythology in a modern setting as background. Reviewers have called its plot \"fast-paced\", meaning that the story moves very quickly. It has humor as well as themes such as love and loyalty. ===Plot summary=== Annabeth Chase and Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, are kidnapped and Percy and his friends must find Artemis before the winter solstice. This is because at the winter solstice, her influence on the Olympian Council could change an important vote. The vote was on the war with the Titans. Thalia Grace, Zoë Nightshade, Bianca Di Angelo, and Grover go on this dangerous quest. They also are searching for a rare monster that Artemis was trying to hunt down when she went missing. This monster is so powerful that it can destroy Olympus. Percy is called by a hippocampus (which is a mythological sea-horse) to rescue a cow-like creature called the Ophiotaurus which lives in the sea. Percy names the Ophiotaurus \"Bessie\". He did not know that it is a male. With help from Apollo, they reach a small town in New Mexico. Grover feels the presence of Pan, the Greek god of nature. Soon, a wild gift from Pan, the giant Erymanthian Boar, comes to carry them to San Francisco. It takes them to the junkyard of the gods. Here, Percy meets Ares and talks to Aphrodite. Aphrodite hints that Annabeth and Percy will fall in love in future. The group then enters the junkyard. There, Bianca tries to steal an action figure for her younger brother. However, she awakens a prototype of Talos, a giant man of bronze. She destroys it, but dies after this. The demigods then go to Hoover Dam. Percy is attacked by skeleton warriors there. He meets Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a girl who can see through the Mist (which prevents common people from seeing monsters and magical things). She saves Percy by confusing the skeletons. This allows Percy and his friends to escape. In San Francisco, they learn that Bessie the Ophiotaurus is the monster Artemis was searching. This is because sacrificing it and burning its entrails will give a person the power to destroy Olympus. They ask for the help of Annabeth's father who gives them a car. They travel to the Garden of Hesperides, where Zoë meets her sisters. She is poisoned by a dragon called Ladon. They continue to the Mountain of Despair on California's Mount Tamalpais, where Mt. Othrys, the Titan capital, is now present. From the top of the mountain where Atlas held up the sky, they see Artemis holding the sky. Annabeth is held captive by Luke. Percy takes the burden—the Titan's curse—from Artemis. After this, a fight breaks out. Atlas (the General of the Titans) kills his daughter Zoë by throwing her against rocks. Artemis tricks Atlas into taking his burden from Percy. Luke falls from a cliff during a battle with Thalia, and Percy thinks that he is dead. They go to Olympus and they keep Ophiotaurus there and at that party Percy is told by Annabeth that Luke has survived. ===Major characters=== * Percy Jackson: Percy Jackson is a fourteen-year-old demigod and the son of Poseidon. He is the main character who tells the story in the series. Percy goes on a journey to save his friend Annabeth and the Greek goddess Artemis, who have both been kidnapped. * Thalia Grace: Thalia is a fifteen-year-old demigod. She is a daughter of Zeus. Thalia appears in Percy's dream in the second book. But she makes a full appearance at the end of The Sea of Monsters. Thalia is given a greater role in the third book. Thalia is described as looking very punk. She wears black clothes, has spiky hair and wears eyeliner. Her personality is described in the book as \"independent and many times sarcastic\". Thalia is a lot like Percy. So, they get into fights often. She has feelings for Luke and was very sad when he betrayed the gods. Thalia is also afraid of heights. * Annabeth Chase: Annabeth is a fourteen- year-old demigod. She is the daughter of Athena. Annabeth is friends with Percy, Thalia and Grover. She is kidnapped along with Artemis by the Titans. Annabeth is very interested in architecture and she wishes to be an architect when she is older. * Grover Underwood: Grover is a satyr. He is 28 years old but looks like a teenager. This is due to the satyrs' slower growth rate (half that of humans). Grover wants to look for Pan, the satyr god of nature and the wild, who fell into a \"deep sleep\" due to the pollution of the world. * Bianca di Angelo: Bianca is a twelve-year-old demigod. She is the daughter of Hades. Bianca and her ten-year-old brother Nico were trapped in the Lotus Hotel, where time is slowed down. When the book begins, they have been released and are attending a school. Bianca later joined the Hunters of Artemis. She was killed in the quest in the \"Junkyard of the Gods\". Her death greatly upsets her brother, Nico. He quickly blames Percy for it. * Zoë Nightshade: Zoë is the daughter of Atlas and a hunter of Artemis. She dies after being bitten by Ladon. Ladon protects the golden apple tree. The fruits of the tree make a person immortal. Artemis turns her spirit into a constellation soon after her death. * Luke Castellan: The demigod son of Hermes, Luke is the main antagonist of the series. The lord of the Titans, Kronos takes over his body at the end of the book. Kronos' followers and army gather on a ship called the Princess Andromeda * Nico di Angelo: Nico is the ten-year-old demigod son of Hades. He and his sister, Bianca di Angelo, were trapped in the Lotus Hotel, where time is slowed down. When the book begins, they have been released and are attending a school. They are rescued from a Manticore by Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, and Grover. He is left at camp during the quest, but stays in the Hermes Cabin because his parentage has not been discovered. He leaves camp after hearing Percy broke his promise of letting Bianca die. Before he leaves, he sends an army of skeletal warriors into the underworld. This shows that he is the son of Hades. ==Critical reception== The Titan's Curse received positive reviews from critics. The reviewers praised the humor and action in the story.

Annabeth and Percy find entrance into the Labyrinth during a game of capture the flag. Percy soon learns that Luke had used the entrance. He will lead the Titan army through the Labyrinth straight into the camp. To get into the Labyrinth, Percy has to find the Delta Symbol (Δ) and touch it.
