The planet first appeared in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and has gone on to appear in many other Star Wars media. The planet was first attacked by the Confederacy of Independent Systems but fended off the attack. It was later under the rule of the Galactic Empire but after the death of their king the species rebelled and used their large cruisers to aid the Rebel Alliance. Over 30 years later the planet was under control by the First Order after the planet helped the Resistance. ==References== Category:Star Wars planets",
