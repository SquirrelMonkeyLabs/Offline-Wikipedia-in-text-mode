 "text": "The Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka (櫻花 \"cherry blossom\") was a type of airplane rocket, used for suicide attacks by the Empire of Japan in the last months of World War II. The United States gave the aircraft the name Baka (Japanese for \"stupid\"). It was carried by a bomber that dropped it when close enough to an enemy ship. The pilot guided it to crash with the target. When dropping down, it could go so fast that it was almost impossible to stop it. The operational record of Ohkas used in action includes three ships sunk and three other ships with great damage. ==Related pages== * Kamikaze * Kaiten == Other websites == *Thunder Gods 1989 book about Ohka squadron *The Cherry Blossom Squadrons 1973 book about Ohka squadron * The History of Kamikaze Ohka 桜花 Category:World War II Japanese aircraft Category:Ballistics",
