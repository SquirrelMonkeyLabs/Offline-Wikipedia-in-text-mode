 "text": "Autism speaks was founded in February 2005 by Bob and Suzanne Wright. Their earlier groups were Cure Autism Now (founded in 1995) and the National Alliance for Autism Research (founded in 1994). Autism Speaks is a controversial network. It used to view autism as a disease, which caused controversy in the autistic community. Autism is not a disease, which is why it upset many people. Autism Speaks has also said that it's possible to cure autism, which we know is not true. There is no cure for autism. ==References== Category:2005 establishments in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:Autism",
