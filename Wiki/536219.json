In May 2014, an Islamist gunman attacked the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, killing four people. In January 2015, Security men stopped a group maybe planned a second Charlie Hebdo shooting. The operation resulted in the deaths of two members of the group. In August 2015, a man shot and stabbed people on a train in Brussels, before being stopped by passengers. The attackers that were part of the November 2015 Paris attacks were based in Molenbeek, and the city of Brussels was closed for five days to search for people. On 18 March 2016, Salah Abdeslam, who possibly was part of the Paris attacks, was caught, and at least one other suspect is still free. == Bombing locations == === Brussels Airport === Two explosions took place in the airport's departure hall. == Victims == At least 31 people were killed and more than 230 others were injured.

One man was arrested, but then released. == The attackers == Belgian authorities said two brothers, Khalid and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, both Belgians with criminal records — were among the three suicide bombers who attacked the Brussels metro and airport.The brothers are believed to have links to last year’s Paris attacks, and to Salah Abdeslam.

In Belgium, officials declared three days of national mourning. Belgian Prime Minister said that Charles Michel sent a message to the people behind the attacks, saying, \"to those who have chosen to be barbarous enemies of freedom, democracy and fundamental values ... we remain united as one.\" In its message claiming responsibility, ISIS noted in a twitter post that \"What will be coming is worse.\" == The world is sad == People shared cartoons and showed sadness in black, yellow and red, the colors of the Belgian flag. Others put messages of solidarity with #JeSuisBruxelles, or \"I am Brussels,\" an ode to a similar outpouring with #JeSuisCharlie after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015. Some people invited tourists stuck after the airport was shut into their homes using #OpenHouse. French cartoonist Jean Plantureux, who goes by Plantu, drew an emotional cartoon for French newspaper Le Monde. A crying person wrapped in a French flag hugs a crying person with a Belgian flag, suggesting solidarity between the two countries. People in Brussels and elsewhere brought flowers and lit candles to show how sad they are after the attacks. == References == Category:2010s explosions in Europe Category:2010s in Belgium Category:Attacks on airports Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2016 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Europe Category:Attacks on railway systems Category:Attacks on transport in Europe 2016 bombings Category:Explosions in 2016 Category:Flemish Brabant Category:Islamic State Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2016 Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in Europe Category:March 2016 events Category:Mass murder in 2016 Category:Massacres in Europe Category:Suicide bombings in the 2010s Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2016",
