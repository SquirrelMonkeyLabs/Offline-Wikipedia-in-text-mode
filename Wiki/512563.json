Movie critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie 3 stars out of 4 and said that \"Like Leone's movie, the Rodriguez epic is more interested in the moment, in great shots, in surprises and ironic reversals and closeups of sweaty faces, than in a coherent story.\" == Cast == * Antonio Banderas as El Mariachi * Salma Hayek as Carolina * Johnny Depp as Sheldon Jeffrey Sands * Rubén Blades as Jorge Ramírez * Mickey Rourke as Billy Chambers * Enrique Iglesias as Lorenzo * Marco Leonardi as Fideo * Pedro Armendáriz, Jr. as President * Willem Dafoe as Armando Barillo * Eva Mendes as Ajedrez Barillo * Danny Trejo as Cucuy * Tony Valdes as Chicle Boy * Gerardo Vigil as General Marquez * Miguel Couturier as Dr. Guevera * Cheech Marin as Belini * Julio Oscar Mechoso as Nicholas ==References== == Other websites == *Official website * Category:2003 action movies Category:2003 thriller movies Category:American action movies Category:American thriller movies Category:American musical movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:English-language movies Category:Miramax movies Category:Movies about revenge Category:Movies about coups d'état Category:Sequel movies Category:Spanish-language movies Category:Mexican action movies Category:Mexican thriller movies Category:Movies directed by Robert Rodriguez",
