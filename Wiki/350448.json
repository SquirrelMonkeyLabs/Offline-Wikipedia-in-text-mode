 "text": "The Dutch Republic, officially known as the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, the Republic of the United Netherlands, or the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, was a republic in Europe. It was a confederacy of provinces that existed from 1581 to 1795. It started when seven northern provinces of the Spanish Netherlands joined together to fight for independence. It ended when Napoleon set up the Batavian Republic, which later became the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the modern Netherlands (now part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands). Alternative names include the United Provinces, Federated Belgic Provinces, and Belgic Federation. Although it was called a republic, its Stadtholder became a heredity dynasty. ==References== Category:Former republics Category:Former countries in Europe Category:1580s establishments in Europe Category:1790s disestablishments in Europe Category:1795 disestablishments Category:Establishments in the Netherlands Category:Disestablishments in the Netherlands",
