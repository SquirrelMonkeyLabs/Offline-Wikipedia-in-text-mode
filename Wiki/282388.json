 "text": "Albufera sauce (known in French as Sauce Albuféra) is a minor sauce whose mother sauce is velouté. It was probably created by Antonin Careme, to accompany Poularde Albufera, which he also created. It was named in honour of the Duke of Albufera. Escoffier gives a recipe in Le Guide culinaire which consists of a base of Suprême Sauce to which is added meat glaze in order to lend the latter an ivory-white tint which characterizes it. It is served chiefly with poultry and sweetbreads.Auguste Escoffier (1907), Le Guide culinaire ==References== Category:Dishes named after people Category:Sauces",
