 "text": "There could be a chemical element with 127 protons and 127 electrons in each of its atoms. Scientists call it Unbiseptium, , eka-americium, Element 127 for now and have given it the chemical symbol Ubs. If this thing is found one day, they will pick a new name for it. ==Naming== The name unbiseptium is a systematic element name, used as a placeholder until its discovery is confirmed. Transuranium elements beyond californium are always created artificially, and the element usually ends up being named for a scientist or a laboratory that does work in atomic physics. ==Making== In 1978, scientists tried to make Unbiseptium by trying to hit tantalum with xenon ions inside the Darmstadt UNILAC accelerator, but failed. ==Related pages== *Unbihexiumâ€“Unbioctium ==References== == Gallery == Category:Hypothetical chemical elements",
