He works in the church for about 15-16 hours a day, Vianney is also known for the multiplication of flour. One time there was a family who was really hungry so they asked John to see if he could do anything about it. He prayed to God and like that the bowl was full of flour that had enough to make some bread in the oven. Category:1786 births Category:1859 deaths",
