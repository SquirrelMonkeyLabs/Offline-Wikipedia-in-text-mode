 "text": "The Angevin Empire was a collection of states ruled by the Angevin Plantagenet dynasty. The Plantagenets, Henry II of England, Richard I of England, and John of England, ruled over an area from the Pyrenees to Ireland during the 12th and early 13th centuries. Their empire was roughly half of medieval France as well as all of England and Ireland. The name Angevin came from the French region and town of Anjou which was the home of the Plantagenet family. ==References== Category:13th century in France Category:History of the British Isles Category:Former empires Category:12th century in France Category:Former countries in Europe Category:12th century in England Category:13th century in England Category:1150s establishments Category:12th-century establishments in Europe Category:Former monarchies of Europe Category:13th-century disestablishments",
