 "text": "Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids. They have a double bond three atoms away from the end methyl group. The most common sources for plant oils are walnuts, hemp oil and flaxseed oil. Sources of animal omega-3 fats include eggs, squid oils and fish. Dietary supplementation does not affect the risk of cancer, heart disease or death. They are not a main treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and other developmental disabilities. However, omega-3 supplements are often given to children with these conditions. ==References== Category:Lipids Category:Food supplements",
