 "text": "Africa is the third largest continent in the world. It makes up about a fifth of the world's total land. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognised and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved. == History == The history of Africa begins with the first modern human beings and continues to its present difficult state as a politically developing continent. Africa's ancient historic period includes the rise of Egyptian civilization. It also includes the development of other societies outside the Nile River Valley, and the interaction between these societies and civilizations outside of Africa. In the late 7th century, North and East Africa were heavily influenced by the spread of Islam. That led to the appearance of new cultures, like the Swahili people and the Mali Empire, whose king, Musa Keita I, became one of the richest and most influential people of the early 14th century. This also led to an increase in the slave trade, which had a very bad influence on Africa’s development until the 19th century. === Slavery === Slavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world.Historical survey > Slave societies , Encyclopædia BritannicaSwahili Coast , National Geographic But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery. Between the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean. Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas.Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History , Encyclopædia Britannica While some Africans collaborated with European and Arab slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently. Africans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.Sailing against slavery. By Jo Loosemore BBC === Colonialism === In the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia\"). Egypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922. === Modern history === African independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent. Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent. A civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people. Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co- operation and peace between the continent's many countries. == Climate == From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north: * Alpine and mediterranean climate * Dry sandy desert * Cold deserts * Fairly dry savannah (grassland) * Rain forest * More grassland * More deserts * Table Mountain * Temperature excursions Running north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes. In fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types. === Rainfall === Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert. In that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow. These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert. Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics: * Tropic of Cancer * Tropic of Capricorn == Plants and animals == Africa has a lot of wildlife.J.Hofman and S.Colbert 2009. The ultimate guide to African mammals. Libeal House, New Jersey.J.Dorst and P.Dandelot 1983. A field guide to the larger mammals of Africa. Collins, London. There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers.N.Myers 1997. The rich diversity of biodiversity issues. (In:Biodiversity II, ed. E.O. Wilson et al, National Academy Press. == Politics == The African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa. == People == Africa was the homeland for the first people. People who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic and Berber languages. The most populated country in Africa is Nigeria. == Countries == Country Area (km²) Population Year Density (per km²) Capital Northern Africa 2,381,740 34,178,188 2009 14 Algiers 1,001,450 82,868,000 2012 83 Cairo 1,759,540 6,310,434 2009 4 Tripoli 446,550 34,859,364 2009 78 Rabat 1,861,484 30,894,000 2008 17 Khartoum 163,610 10,486,339 2009 64 Tunis 23,000 942,333 2016 22 Djibouti 121,320 5,647,168 2016 47 Asmara 1,127,127 102,403,196 2016 75 Addis Ababa 637,657 14,317,996 2017 15 Mogadishu East Africa 27,830 8,988,091 2009 323 Gitega, Bujumbura 2,170 752,438 2009 347 Moroni 582,650 39,002,772 2009 66 Nairobi 587,040 20,653,556 2009 35 Antananarivo 118,480 14,268,711 2009 120 Lilongwe 2,040 1,284,264 2009 630 Port Louis 801,590 21,669,278 2009 27 Maputo 26,338 10,473,282 2009 398 Kigali 455 87,476 2009 192 Victoria 619,745 8,260,490 2008 13 Juba 945,087 44,929,002 2009 43 Dodoma 236,040 32,369,558 2009 137 Kampala 752,614 11,862,740 2009 16 Lusaka Central Africa 1,246,700 12,799,293 2009 10 Luanda 475,440 18,879,301 2009 40 Yaoundé 622,984 4,511,488 2009 7 Bangui 1,284,000 10,329,208 2009 8 N'Djamena 342,000 4,012,809 2009 12 Brazzaville 2,345,410 69,575,000 2012 30 Kinshasa 28,051 633,441 2009 23 Malabo 267,667 1,514,993 2009 6 Libreville 1,001 212,679 2009 212 São Tomé Southern Africa 600,370 1,990,876 2009 3 Gaborone 30,355 2,130,819 2009 70 Maseru 825,418 2,108,665 2009 3 Windhoek 1,219,912 51,770,560 2011 42 Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Pretoria 17,363 1,123,913 2009 65 Mbabane 390,580 11,392,629 2009 29 Harare West Africa 112,620 8,791,832 2009 78 Porto-Novo 274,200 15,746,232 2009 57 Ouagadougou 4,033 429,474 2009 107 Praia 322,460 20,617,068 2009 64 Abidjan, Yamoussoukro 11,300 1,782,893 2009 158 Banjul 239,460 23,832,495 2009 100 Accra 245,857 10,057,975 2009 41 Conakry 36,120 1,533,964 2009 43 Bissau 111,370 3,441,790 2009 31 Monrovia 1,240,000 12,666,987 2009 10 Bamako 1,030,700 3,129,486 2009 3 Nouakchott 1,267,000 15,306,252 2009 12 Niamey 923,768 166,629,000 2012 180 Abuja 196,190 13,711,597 2009 70 Dakar 71,740 6,440,053 2009 90 Freetown 56,785 6,019,877 2009 106 Lomé Africa Total 30,368,609 1,001,320,281 2009 33 == African diaspora == Countries with significant African descendents outside Africa: * Haiti: 98% * Saint Kitts and Nevis: 96.9% * Anguilla: 91.4% * Bahamas: 86.1% * Barbados: 81.1% * Jamaica: 76.3% * Dominican Republic: 71.1% * Cayman Islands: 60.0% * Trinidad and Tobago: 39.5% * Cuba: 34.9% * Turks and Caicos: 34.0% * Belize: 29.8% * Venezuela: 24.0% * Panama: 22.0% * Colombia: 21.0% * Brazil: 13-19% * United States: 12.9% * Puerto Rico: 6.9% * Argentina: less than 2% == References == == Other websites == * African & Middle Eastern Reading Room from the United States Library of Congress * Africa South of the Sahara from Stanford University * The Index on Africa from The Norwegian Council for Africa * Aluka Digital library of scholarly resources from and about Africa * Africa Interactive Map from the United States Army Africa ;History * African Kingdoms * The Story of Africa from BBC World Service * Africa Policy Information Center (APIC) * Hungarian military forces in Africa ;News media * allAfrica.com current news, events and statistics * Focus on Africa magazine from BBC World Service Category:Gondwana",
