 "text": "The Tagish Lake meteorite fell at 16:43 UTC on 18 January 2000 in the Tagish Lake area in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. The rock was about 4 metres in diameter and 56 tonnes in weight before it entered the Earth's atmosphere. About 97% of the meteorite had vaporised in the atmosphere. Of the 1.3 tonnes of fragmented rock, over 10 kilograms (22 lb) (about 1%) was found and collected. Analyses have shown that Tagish Lake fragments contain unchanged stellar dust granules which may have been part of the cloud of material that made the Solar System and Sun. The meteorite contains organic material, including amino acids.NASA, Asteroid Served Up \"Custom Orders\" of Life's Ingredients , June 9, 2011 (accessed 23 November 2013) == References == Category:Meteorites Category:2000 in North America",
