 "text": "A NAND gate is a logic gate used to build digital logic circuits. It is a combination of an AND and NOT gate. The name refers to this. The NAND gate is a “universal gate”, that means all other types of logic gates can be obtained by wiring exclusively one or more NAND gates in a particular manner. == Behavior == Given two inputs, A and B, A NAND B will be true if at most one of A and B is true. In other words, A NAND B is false if both A and B are true, and true otherwise. INPUT INPUT OUTPUT A B A ⊼ B 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 == Symbols == There are three symbols for drawing NAND gates in electrical circuit schematics: the \"distinctive shape\" symbol, the “military” symbol, and the “rectangular” symbol. For more information see logic gate symbols. File:Nand-gate-en.svg|“Distinctive shape” NAND symbol, also that used by US ANSI File:Logic-gate-nand-de.png|“Military” NAND symbol, also that used by DIN File:IEC NAND label.svg|“Rectangular” NAND symbol, used by IEC == Application == Since a NAND gate is a universal gate, microprocessors can be built using this type of gate only. For example: * the negation can be represented by ¬A ≡ A ⊼ A * and the disjunction can be obtained by A ∨ B ≡ (A ⊼ A) ⊼ (B ⊼ B) Category:Logic gates",
