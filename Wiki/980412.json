He is known for his role as Roger Davis in the original cast of Jonathan Larson's musical Rent on Broadway, the 2005 film version of the musical, and the Broadway Tour of 1996 musical Rent in 2009. He is also known for the role of Radames in Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida and for playing the Emcee from the 1998 Cabaret revival. He most recently appeared as Huey Calhoun in the Broadway Company of Memphis. ==Early life and stage works== Pascal was born in The Bronx, New York, and grew up in Woodbury, Nassau County, New York, with his mother, Wendy (n√©e Frishman), and stepfather, Mel Seamon. He was raised Jewish. He graduated from Syosset High School. Before his interest in music, he was a personal trainer. Although he started out as a rock musician playing in various bands (such as Mute) formed with his schoolmates, Pascal was drawn to the musical theatre. A friend of his from high school mentioned Rent to him. On a whim, he auditioned and was cast as the HIV positive rock guitarist Roger Davis. His powerful tenor voice and his performance in Rent earned him a Tony nomination, a Theater World Award and an Obie Award. He left the show on November 2, 1997, but returned to play Roger when Rent opened in London. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:American movie actors Category:American rock singers Category:Jewish American musicians Category:Living people Category:Musicians from the Bronx Category:Actors from the Bronx Category:Singers from New York City",
