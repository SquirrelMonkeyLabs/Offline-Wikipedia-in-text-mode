When Wendy Alexander quit her job as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2008, Gray stood at the next leadership election and was elected with a 57.8% total vote. At first, Gray had some good electoral victories for Scottish Labour, including declining the Scottish National Party trials at the Glenrothes in 2008, and also seeing the Scottish Labour keep their 41 seats in the House of Commons in the 2010 general election. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (UK) members of the Scottish Parliament Category:People from East Lothian",
