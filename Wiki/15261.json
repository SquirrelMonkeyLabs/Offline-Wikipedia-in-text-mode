He won two Academy Awards, his first for Best Actor for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's action thriller The French Connection (1971) and his second for Best Supporting Actor for playing a sheriff in Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven (1992). He was also nominated for an Oscar for his roles in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), I Never Sang for My Father (1970) and in Mississippi Burning (1988). ==Early life== Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California. His parents divorced while he was a child, and he moved from one place to another until he settled finally in Danville, Illinois, where he lived with his English-born grandmother. He left home at 16 years old to join the Marines, where he served three years as a radio operator. Having finished his service, he moved to New York, where he worked in several minor jobs. He then studied television (TV) production and journalism at the University of Illinois. ==Career== Already over 30 years old, Hackman decided to become an actor, and joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California. It was in that school that Hackman became friends with another man named Dustin Hoffman, who also wanted to be an actor. After working hard in many roles he became a well- respected actor. He won two Academic Awards, and has played many well-known roles. ==Death== In the final months of his life, Hackman's neighbors in Santa Fe, New Mexico, noticed that his health got worse. Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa died in their home on February 12, 2025. Hackman was unable to understand her death because he had Alzheimer's disease. Hackman died in the home around February 18, 2025, at which point his pacemaker recorded an abnormal rhythm. He died from severe heart disease, caused by advanced Alzheimer's disease and kidney disease. Hackman was 95. On February 26, the bodies of Hackman, Arakawa, and one of their dogs, named Zinna, were found.
