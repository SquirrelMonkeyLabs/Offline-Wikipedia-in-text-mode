 "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S4 is an Android phone developed made by Samsung Electronics as the fourth smartphone of the Samsung Galaxy S series and was first seen publicly on March 14, 2013, at Samsung Mobile Unpacked in New York City. It is the successor to the Galaxy S III, which maintains a similar design, but with upgraded hardware and an increased focus on software features that take advantage of its hardware functionsâ€”such as the ability to detect when a finger is over the screen, and expanded eye tracking functionality, it was released the previous year. A new version of the S4 became the first phone to support the coming LTE Advanced mobile network standard. The T-Mobile version of the Galaxy S4, was released the same month. The phone's successor, the Samsung Galaxy S5, was released the next year. == References == Category:Samsung Galaxy Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2013",
