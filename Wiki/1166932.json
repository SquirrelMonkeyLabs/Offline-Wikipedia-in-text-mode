 "text": "Just Asking Questions (JAQ) is a pseudoskepticalFaking as being neutral about a topic to hide one's bias. * * * tactic. ==Overview== JAQ is used by conspiracy theorists to promote false claims by phrasing them as questions. They often claim to be \"only asking questions\" about certain proven facts, such as the Holocaust,Introduction to the Holocaust: * * * * * * Further information about the Holocaust: * * * * * the Holodomor, * * * * * * * * * * and Assyrian genocide. * * * * * * Bat Ye’or, Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide (Madison: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2002), p. 169. * * * * ==Examples== ===Holocaust denial=== Just Asking Questions (JAQ) is extremely common among Holocaust deniers, who tend to ask questions with false assumptions to cast doubt on the genocide of Jews in WWII Nazi-occupied land. * * * * * Writing for the Slate magazine, Johannes Breit, a German historian, stated that JAQ had been seen frequently in posts made by Holocaust deniers in Reddit's r/AskHistorian subreddit (2.2M subscribers), which prompted its moderators to ban them from participation in 2018. Meanwhile, Reddit has been long been criticized for uncontrolled antisemitism. * * * * * American historian Deborah Lipstadt (1947 – ) commented on JAQ's potential impact: The Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a self-declared academic group that has been promoting Holocaust denial since 1978, uses JAQ in most of their publications. The Counter Extremism Project summarized IHR's activities as follows: While lying about being neutral, the IHR advances the antisemitic trope that the Holocaust was \"invented\" by Jews to \"further Jewish-Zionist interests.\" The IHR also promoted the myth that \"Nazi Germany actively supported Zionism\". IHR's Holocaust distortion has had a considerable impact across the political spectrum. Former London mayor Ken Livingstone (1945 – ), who was a British Labour Party member until 2018, promoted the myth, so did PA's leader * * * * * * and American Trotskyist activist writer Lenni Brenner (1937 – ) who published a book endorsing the myth. * * * * * * * * Since then, Brenner has denied encouraging Holocaust distortion, despite the book's content being cited extensively by antisemites on both the far right and far left to trivialize the Holocaust and demonize the vast majority of diaspora Jews who support Israel's right to exist. ==Similar concepts== ===Sealioning=== Sealioning is a similar concept to JAQ. Sealioning refers to the act of repeating the same questions that have already been answered while faking ignorance and politeness. It is also common on online forums and social media, * * * where antisemitism, especially Holocaust denial, is widespread. * * * * * ==References== Category:Logic Category:Rhetoric Category:Logical fallacies",
