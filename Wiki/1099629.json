 "text": "John Fryer RN (15 August 1753 â€“ 26 May 1817) was the sailing master on the HMAV Bounty, a British vessel made famous by the Mutiny on the Bounty. He had the interesting position of being a strong critic of both Captain William Bligh and mutiny leader Fletcher Christian, Despite his anger at Bligh, he did not support the mutiny. Fryer was born at Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk. After his naval service, he returned to Wells, and his grave in the churchyard is now clearly identified. In 1787, Fryer was appointed master of HMS Bounty, with Fletcher Christian serving as master's mate. On 10 January 1788, Bligh put his crew on three watches, giving one of them to Christian, and on 2 March, promoted Christian to acting lieutenant. Some have speculated that this was the source of the ill-will that later developed between Fryer and Bligh. However, as a master, Fryer would never have been promoted to lieutenant at sea. Indeed, he never did become a lieutenant. Fryer remained loyal, and accompanied Bligh in reaching Timor. Bligh's account of the mutiny vilified Fryer, but Fryer gave fair evidence at Bligh's court-martial. Edward Christian, Fletcher's brother, was assisted by Fryer in publishing a counterweight to Bligh's version. Fryer never received promotion, but served in the Royal Navy until 1812. After his naval service, he returned to Wells. ==References== Category:1753 births Category:1817 deaths Category:British sailors Category:Mutiny on the Bounty Category:People from Norfolk Category:Crew of HMS Bounty",
