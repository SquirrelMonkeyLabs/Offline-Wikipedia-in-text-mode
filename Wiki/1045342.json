 "text": "The Italy women's national football team () is a women's football team for Italy, has been playing football internationally since 1968. The team is managed by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). They started playing in 1968 and took part in some unofficial international tournaments. They even hosted the first unofficial European Competition in 1969 and a World Cup in 1970. Italy did well and reached the quarter-finals in the first official World Cup in 1991 and also in the first European Championship they entered. But, even though they got second place in the European Championship in 1993 and 1997, they haven't done as well in the World Cup. In 2019, after 20 years, Italy finally qualified for the World Cup again, and they did just as well as before, reaching the quarter-finals. == References == Category:European women's national association football teams Category:Football in Italy Category:National sports teams of Italy Category:Articles with hCards",
