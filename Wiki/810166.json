In police work, a mole is an undercover law-enforcement agent who joins an organization in order to collect incriminating evidence about its operations, and so bring its members to justice. The term was introduced to the public by British spy novelist John Le Carr√© in his 1974 novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. == References == Category:Espionage",
