 "text": "In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1. The equation of the unit circle is x^2 + y^2 = 1. The unit circle is centered at the Origin, or coordinates (0,0). It is often used in Trigonometry. ==Trigonometric functions in the unit circle== In a unit circle, where t is the angle desired, x and y can be defined as \\cos (t) = x and \\sin (t) = y. Using the function of the unit circle, x^2 + y^2 = 1, another equation for the unit circle is found, \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1. When working with trigonometric functions, it is mainly useful to use angles with measures between 0 and \\pi\\over 2 radians, or 0 through 90 degrees. It is possible to have higher angles than that, however. Using the unit circle, two identities can be found: \\cos (t) = \\cos (2 \\cdot \\pi k + t) and sin (t) = \\sin (2 \\cdot \\pi k + t) for any integer k.
