The plaza was renamed by Mayor Muriel Bowser on June 5, 2020, after the Department of Public Works painted the words \"Black Lives Matter\" in yellow capital letters, along with the flag of Washington, D.C., as part of the George Floyd protests. ==References== Category:2020 establishments in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Washington, D.C.
