 "text": "The Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 AD) was a period in which the Roman Empire almost collapsed. There were invasions, civil war, plague, and the economy collapsed. The crisis is sometimes called the \"Military Anarchy\" or \"Imperial Crisis\".Brown, Peter Robert Lamont 1971. The world of late antiquity. London: Thames and Hudson. ISBN 978-0500320228 The crisis began with the assassination of Emperor Alexander Severus at the hands of his own troops in 235 AD. This started a fifty-year period in which 20–25 rivals struggled for the throne. Most were important Roman Army generals who took control over all or part of the Empire. By 258–260, the Empire had split into three competing states. There was the Gallic Empire, which included the Roman provinces of Gaul, Britannia and Hispania, and the Palmyrene Empire, with the eastern provinces of Syria Palaestina and Aegyptus. These became independent of the Italian Roman Empire proper, which stood between them. The crisis ended with the ascension of Diocletian in 284.Potter, David Stone 2004. The Roman Empire at bay, AD 180–395. Routledge history of the ancient world. Psychology Press. pp. 85, 167. ISBN 978-0415100588 The crisis resulted in many changes to the Empire's institutions, society, economic life and, eventually, religion. It was a transition period between classical antiquity and late antiquity. == References == Category:Roman Empire Category:Civil wars Category:3rd century",
