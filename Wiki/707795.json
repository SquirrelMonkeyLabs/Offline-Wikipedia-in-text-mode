The first European in the district was an explorer and botanist named Allan Cunningham, who came there in 1827. The first farm in the district, Barraba Station, began in 1837 or 1838. The site of the village was surveyed in 1852. The discovery of gold helped the village to grow bigger. The first post office was opened in 1856 and the first school was opened in 1861. The first Anglican church was built in 1876 and the first bank was also opened in 1876. The first hotel, The Commercial Hotel, was built in 1878 and the first court house was built in 1881. Barraba was officially called a village in 1885. The hospital was built in 1891 and the Methodist church was built in 1898. Barraba's newspaper, The Barraba Gazette, began publishing in 1900, but the newspaper closed in 2020. The Catholic church was built in 1906. The railway came to Barraba in 1908, however the last train went to Barraba in 1983 and the line closed in 1987. The Connors Creek Dam was built in 1933. This dam improved the water supply of the village. == Transport == There are buses to and from Tamworth and Inverell everyday except for Tuesdays. == Mining == === Copper === Copper was discovered at Gulf Creek in 1889 and the first mine was started in 1892. Gulf Creek is 22 kilometres (14 miles) north- east from Barraba. A small village began to grow, which had a hotel, a school, and a post office. This copper mine was the biggest copper mine in New South Wales in 1903 and the little village had 300 people living there. The mine was closed in the 1930s, and the post office was closed in 1966. The little village was abandoned. === Asbestos === Asbestos was mined from 1919 until 1983 at Woodsreef, which was a little village 15 kilometres (10 miles) east from Barraba. The mine was made bigger in 1974. This mine produced 5,000,000 metric tonnes of white asbestos. The abandoned mine left behind 75,000,000 metric tonnes of waste rocks and 25,000,000 metric tonnes of asbestos. The asbestos heap covers 43 hectares (107 acres) and is up to 70 metres (230 feet) high.Woodsreef Asbestos Mine Site Rehabilitation Private Members Statement, 29 August 2008. A television report in 2008 described the growing worry that the remaining asbestos could harm the health for the people who live in Barraba and for the people who visit the village.Abandoned asbestos mine causes community outrage A foundation, The Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, demanded that the mine should be cleaned up. This foundation also demanded that people must not be allowed to go to the mine. A public dirt road crossed the mine site but that road was closed in 2013. The little village was abandoned. The government health service, Hunter-New England Health, did an urgent study about the possible harm to the health of the people of Barraba, but that study has not been published.Woodsreef health report under wraps File:Woodsreef.JPG|the asbestos mine at Woodsreef File:Chrysotile 1.jpg|asbestos File:Heat-resistant asbestos fabric.jpg|cloth made from asbestos File:Early Asbestosis in a Retired Pipe Fitter.jpg|asbestosis, a disease caused by asbestos === Diatomite === Diatomite, or diatomaceous earth, is a mineral made from the fossils of diatoms.
