 "text": "The Silvertown Tunnel is a road tunnel being built under the River Thames between the Greenwich Peninsula and west Silvertown. It is paid for by Transport for London and is being built by the Riverlinx consortium. The tunnel is intended to reduce congestion through the Blackwall Tunnel. People will have to pay to use both of them when it opens in 2025. The contract for building started in November 2019. Bicycles will not be able to ride through it, but there are plans for a bicycle shuttle bus. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 21st century Category:Tunnels underneath the River Thames",
