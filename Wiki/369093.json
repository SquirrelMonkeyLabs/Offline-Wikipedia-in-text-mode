 "text": "A skin tag is a small growth of fat on the skin that is usually harmless. It may have a short narrow stalk which connects it to the skin. They are usually small but may grow up to a half-inch long. Skin tags usually do not need treatment. Someone may decide to have a skin tag removed if it is irritating them or they do not like the way it looks. If so the skin tag may be removed by surgery, freezing, or burning.
