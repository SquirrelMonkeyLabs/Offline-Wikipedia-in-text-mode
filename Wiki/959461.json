 "text": "The Song of Australia is a poem that was proposed to be the national anthem of Australia. It was very popular in South Australia. ==Lyrics== There is a land where summer skies Are gleaming with a thousand eyes, Blending in witching harmonies ; And grassy knoll and forest height, Are flushing in the rosy light, And all above is azure bright — Australia! There is a land where honey flows, Where laughing corn luxuriant grows, Land of the myrtle and the rose; On hill and plain the clust'ring vine Is gushing out with purple wine, And cups are quaffed to thee and thine — Australia! There is a land where treasures shine Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine For worshippers at Mammon's shrine; Where gold lies hid, and rubies gleam, And fabled wealth no more doth seem The idle fancy of a dream — Australia! There is a land where homesteads peep From sunny plain and woodland steep, And love and joy bright vigils keep; Where the glad voice of childish glee Is mingling with the melody Of nature's hidden minstrelsy — Australia! There is a land where, floating free, From mountain-top to girdling sea, A proud flag waves exultingly; And FREEDOM'S sons the banner bear, No shackled slave can breathe the air, Fairest of Britain's daughters fair — Australia! ==Related pages== * \"My Bougainville\", sung to the same tune ==References== Category:Australian anthems",
