 "text": "The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) is the U.S. Army's replacement program for heavy tracked and wheeled armored fighting vehicles. The GCV is part of the Follow On Incremental Capabilities Package of the BCT Modernization program. The vehicle of the vehicle family is to be built by 2015 and given out by 2017. It replaced the canceled Future Combat Systems, manned ground vehicles program. ==Design== The GCV family will be built around one or more common vehicle bodies. The GCV would have a very advanced communications system. The vehicle will be heavy and large but it must be moved by aircraft, rail and ship. The GCV will have good off-road mobility while remaining fuel efficient. The type and caliber of the weapons are still secret. The Army has only said that there will be lethal and non-lethal means to help with missions in both civilian and non-civilian places. The Army would like the GCV to have good bomb protection and would like it to be able to destroy enemy missiles. ==Variants== The U.S. Army wants a troop carrier and a \"secondary vehicle\". The Army will ask for more variants later. ===Infantry Fighting Vehicle=== The IFV will replace the M113 APC by 2018, the M2 Bradley and the Stryker ICV later. The IFV will hold a crew of three and a squad of nine people. ===Secondary vehicle=== The \"secondary vehicle\" is listed on the \"Work Breakdown Structure\" document. So far, no details have been released about the use of this vehicle. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official U.S. Army Ground Combat Vehicle page * TACOM page Category:Weapons Category:Land vehicles",
