The site became Vauxhall Gardens in 1785 and money was charged to gain entry. In 1817, the Battle of Waterloo was re-played with 1,000 soldiers taking part. The park closed in 1859 and the land was sold to become buildings. ==More reading== *Scott, Walter Sidney, Green retreats; the story of Vauxhall Gardens, 1661–1859.
