 "text": "Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs. They are part of the family Leptodactylidae. They are also part of the subfamily Ceratophryinae. They are also known as South American horned frogs as well as Pacman frogs. This is because they look like the video game character Pac-Man. == Diet == These frogs eat a large amount of food. They will eat insects, small mammals (such as mice), fish, other frogs, and small reptiles. They are sit and wait predators. Since female frogs are normally larger than male frogs, an adult female Argentine Horned Frog can eat an adult rat. These frogs are also cannibals and sometimes eat their mates and other pacman frogs. These frogs can swallow animals almost half their size, but they might try to eat things larger than them. Their teeth, as well as bones in the front of their jaw, can make it hard for them to release prey after it is already in their mouth. This can cause death by choking. They have very sticky tongues that they use to catch prey and pull it into their mouth. Large pacman frogs have bite forces that are close to some mammal predators. == Lifespan == The average lifespan of a Ceratophrys frog in the wild is about 1 to 4 years. In captivity and as pets, they may live up to 15 years if they are eating well and have good care. A Pacman frog owner who gives their frog a good home, feeds their frog a good diet of live insects, and pays attention its health should expect their frog to live for a longer time. == Images == File:Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata).jpg|Ceratophrys ornata File:FantasyCeratophrys.jpg|A Fantasy-coloured Pac-Man frog Image:Chet_Pac_Man_toad.jpg|A young Pac-Man frog Image:Ceratophrys ornata (Pacman Frog).JPG|This Albino Pac-Man frog is six months old File:Cornuta_side_view_web.jpg|Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton File:Ceratophrys_cornuta_skeleton_front.jpg|Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
