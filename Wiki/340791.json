The capital city is also called Cabinda. The province is divided into four municipalities - Belize, Buco Zau, Cabinda and Landana. Around 357,576 people live there. Cabinda is separated from the rest of Angola by a narrow strip of land of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cabinda is bordered on the north by the Republic of the Congo, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean. While the civil war in Angola ended in 2002, there is still fighting in Cabinda.
