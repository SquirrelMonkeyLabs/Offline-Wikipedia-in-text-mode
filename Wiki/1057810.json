 "text": "The WAGR N class were a total of 42 side tank steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways from 1896 to 1960. The WAGR N class was originally built in 1896 by Neilson & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland for suburban passenger-working around Perth on the Eastern Railway between Fremantle and Midland and later on the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Loop Line. In 1898-99 Robert Stephenson & Coy of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England constructed another twelve adding to the original five, along with another fifteen by Nasmyth, Wilson & Coy of Salford, England in 1901. Midland Workshops built ten more N class from 1907 to 1908 using parts from the O class, this technically being the first class built in-house by the WAGR. All were allocated to Perth by the mid-1930s with all being withdrawn by late 1960. No. 201, built in 1898 by Robert Stephenson & Coy, is preserved at ARHS Bassendean Railway Museum (Rail Heritage W.A.), though it is currently stored in the workshops complex on-site.
