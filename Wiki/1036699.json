 "text": "The death of Queen Cleopatra VII, on August 10 or 12, 30 BC, in Alexandria Governorate. Queen Cleopatra was 39 years old. But Queen Cleopatra committed suicide, as the Greek and Roman historians said, she ended herself or named the same Cleopatra herself by means of toxic bandages. Where these ancient Roman poets said, Aestrabo, Plutarch, and Cassius Dio. Archaeological stories about the chances of snakes and scorpions causing a person's immediate death are a matter of debate among modern scholars. Some scholars have advanced the hypothesis that Octavian, the founder of a cult of three to Cleopatra, had forced her to commit suicide by choosing her. Of the archaeological records, Octavian allowed Cleopatra's body to be buried in a grave that no one knew until now, and it was not mentioned in any book, and her husband, Mark Anthony, was willing to do so. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Ptolemaic Alexandria Category:Unsolved deaths",
