 "text": "Fictional languages, often referred to as constructed languages or conlangs, are linguistic systems created for the purpose of storytelling within works of fiction. These languages are devised by authors, filmmakers, or other creators to add depth, cultural richness, and authenticity to the imaginary worlds they construct. Unlike natural languages that evolve organically over time within human societies, fictional languages are intentionally designed with specific grammatical rules, vocabulary, and sometimes even scripts. The oldest significant fictional language appears to be Newspeak, a fictional language invented for George Orwell's 1984, written in 1949. Fictional Languages have grown significantly in prominence since then, especially within the science fiction community, with some notable examples of Fictional Languages including; Klingon, Sindarin, and Huttese. == List of Fictional Languages == (By alphabetic order) # Ancient - Stargate SG-1 # Atlantean - Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire # Dothraki - Game of Thrones # Dovahzul - The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim # D'ni - Myst # Ewokese - Star Wars universe # Esperanto - Incubus (1950 film), Blade: Trinity (Also used as an actual constructed language) # Ferb Latin - Phineas and Ferb # Furbish - Furby toys # Heptapod B - Arrival (2016 film) # Huttese - Star Wars universe # Hylian - The Legend of Zelda video game series # Klingon (tlhIngan Hol) - Star Trek series # Mandalorian - Star Wars universe # Minionese - Despicable Me franchise # Morse Code (BEEP) - The Iron Giant # Na'vi - Avatar # Newspeak - 1984 by George Orwell # Old Tongue - The Wheel of Time series # Parseltongue - Harry Potter series # Quenya and Sindarin - J.R.R.
