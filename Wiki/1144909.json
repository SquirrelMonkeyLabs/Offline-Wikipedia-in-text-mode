Surrounding the chapel are cement graves of soldiers with many tombstones, inscribed with the names of those who died between 1858-1860. == History == The Y Pha Nho Cemetery was established following the French-Spanish coalition's invasion of Vietnam in 1858, which began with their assault on Da Nang and marked the start of a prolonged occupation. Soldiers who perished in this campaign were initially buried across different locations. Later, in 1895, Paul Doumer, then Governor-General of Indochina, collected their remains on Son Tra Peninsula and constructed this cemetery to honor the French and Spanish soldiers who lost their lives. == References == # Báo Công an TP Đà Nẵng Online — Nghĩa địa I-pha-nho và lòng dân Đà Nẵng # Bảo Tàng Đà Nẵng — Nghĩa địa Pháp - Tây Ban Nha: Sự nhân văn của người Việt - Bảo tàng Đà Nẵng # TRE Magazine — Mộ Y Pha Nho ở bán đảo Sơn Trà - TRE Magazine # TUOI TRE ONLINE — 160 năm ngày Đà Nẵng kháng Pháp - kỳ 3: Chứng tích máu xương - Tuổi Trẻ Online # Y Pha Nho French colonial cemetery, Danang Category:Cemeteries Category:Da Nang",
