(2005). \"Genshō\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 240. In the history of Japan, Genshō was the fifth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant, meaning that she was the ruler in her own right and not a ruler because she was a married to a ruler. Genshō was the only Japanese empress regnant to get her title from another empress regnant, rather than a previous male ruler. ==Related pages== * Japanese empresses *Nihon Shoki ==References== Category:683 births Category:748 deaths Category:Emperors of Japan",
