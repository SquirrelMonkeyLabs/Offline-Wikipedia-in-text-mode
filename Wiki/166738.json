 "text": "Hurricane Charley was the second hurricane and also the second major hurricane (category 3+) of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15. Its strongest winds were 150 mph (240 km/h), classifying it as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida. It was the strongest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Andrew, twelve years earlier. In the United States, Charley caused ten deaths and $15.4 billion in damage (2004 USD). ==The destruction from Hurricane Charley== Charley did its damage in a very similar manner to Andrew: high winds caused almost all the damage, and both storms made landfall at low tide, preventing the storm surges from causing damage like they usually do when hurricanes make landfall. Both were compact storms upon landfall. == References == Category:2004 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes Category:2004 in the United States Category:2000s in Cuba Category:Retired tropical cyclone names Category:Hurricanes in the United States Category:2000s in the Cayman Islands Category:2000s in Jamaica Category:Hurricanes in Florida Category:Hurricanes in Jamaica",
