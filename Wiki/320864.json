People say he has a \"philosophy unified by decentralism\"John F.

The Importance of Growing Up Village, Front Porch Republic He graduated from Cornell University, majoring in history, in 1958.Richard and Mimi Farina \"fan site\" . He served as editor of the student-owned and managed newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun. Sale was one of the leaders of the May 23, 1958 protest against university policies forbidding male and female students fraternizing and its in loco parentis policy.The protest arrived at the home of President Deane Waldo Malott just as he was hosting a dinner for John L. Collyer the Chairman of the Board and his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Collyer stood behind Malott as students threw eggs at him. A few days later, the board met to vote to grant degrees to the graduating class. Normally, one vote is taken for all graduating students, but Sale was singled out for a separate debate. Sale and his friend and roommate Richard Farina, and three others, were charged by Cornell. The protest was described in Farina's 1966 novel, Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me. In 1958 he collaborated with Thomas Pynchon on an unproduced futuristic musical called \"Minstrel Island.\"Thomas Pynchon: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center . Upon graduating in 1958, Sale married Faith Apfelbaum. She later worked as an editor with Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller and Amy Tan. Faith died in 1999.Bruce Weber, Obituary: Faith Sale, 63, a Fiction Editor Known as a Writers' Advocate, New York Times, December 13, 1999. Sale worked initially in journalism for the leftist journal New Leader, \"a magazine founded in 1924 in part by socialists Norman Thomas and Eugene Debs,\"Hunter, Jack (2011-06-16) Radical Kirk , The American Conservative and the New York Times Magazine. He then became a freelance journalist. He spent time in Ghana and wrote his first book about it. His second book, SDS, was about the radical 1960s group Students for a Democratic Society, of which he was a founder. The book \"is still considered one of the best sources on the youth activist organization that helped define 1960s radicalism.\" In 1968, he signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.“Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” January 30, 1968 New York Post Subsequent books explored radical decentralism, bioregionalism,Anderson, Walter Truett.

In a New York Times book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee William H. McNeill wrote about Sale: \"he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded.\"William H. McNeill, Review of Kirkpatrick Sale's The Conquest of Paradise, New York Times, October 7, 1990. The book Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in American History presents a debate between Sale and Robert Royal, vice president for research at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, who insisted that Columbus was a courageous risk-taker who advanced knowledge about other parts of the world.Larry Madaras & James M. SoRelle (eds.), Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in American History, Vol. I (10th ed.), McGraw-Hill/Dushkin, 2002, . ===Technology=== Sale \"has written extensively and skeptically about technology,\" and has said he is \"a great admirer\" of anarchoprimitivist John Zerzan.Noble, Kenneth (1995-05-07) Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber, New York Times He has described personal computers as \"the devil's work\" and in the past started public speeches by smashing one.Wired editor Kevin Kelly's interview with Sale, June 1995 During promotion of his 1995 book Rebels Against the Future: The Luddites and Their War on the Industrial Revolution, Sale debated with Newsweek Magazine senior editor and technology columnist Steven Levy \"about the relative merits of the communications age\".Kirkpatrick Sale-Steven Levy Debate At New Jersey Institute of Technology Will Address Merits of Technology , February 1998. Sale has said that he does not \"care much for popular music outside some of the Tin Pan Alley era tunes of the early 20th century.\" For example, \"he once heard a 'racket' in a nightclub during ... the 1960s from some 'young man' everyone told him was a 'big deal.' That 'young man' turned out to be Bob Dylan.\" Kirk recalls that \"he’d never heard anything so awful in his life.\" In 1995, Sale agreed to a public bet with Kevin Kelly that by the year 2020, there would be three disasters: global currency collapse, significant warfare between rich and poor, and environmental disasters of some significant size. The bet was turned into a claim on the FX prediction market, where the probability has hovered around 25%.FX Claim NLud (Claim NLud - Neo- Luddite K. Sale wins bet) , The Foresight Exchange Prediction Market web site. Retrieved January 1, 2012. ===Secession=== Sale believes that people should be able to break apart large nation-states into small pieces (secession). Sale has been called \"one of the intellectual godfathers of the secessionist movement.\"Chris Hedges, The New Secessionists, also at LewRockwell.com, April 26, 2010. He argues that the major theme of contemporary history, from the dissolution of the Soviet Union to the expansion of United Nations membership from 51 in 1945 to nations today, is the breakup of great empires. People on both left and right call for smaller, less powerful government. In 2004, Sale and members of the Second Vermont Republic formed the Middlebury Institute which is dedicated to the study of separatism, secession, and self- determination. Sale is director of the institute. In 2006, Middlebury sponsored the First North American Secessionist Convention, which attracted 40 participants from 16 secessionist organizations and was described as the first gathering of secessionists since the American Civil War. Delegates issued a statement of principles of secession which they presented as the \"Burlington Declaration\".Information on the 2006 secession convention and Burlington Declaration at MiddleburyInstitute.org In October 2007, the New York Times interviewed Sale about the Second North American Secessionist Convention, co- hosted by the Middlebury Institute. Sale told the interviewer, \"The virtue of small government is that the mistakes are small as well.\" He went on to say, \"If you want to leave a nation you think is corrupt, inefficient, militaristic, oppressive, repressive, but you don't want to move to Canada or France, what do you do? Well, the way is through secession, where you could stay home and be where you want to be.”Information on the 2007 Secession convention at MiddleburyInstitute.org The convention received worldwide media attention.Bill Poovey, Secessionists Meeting in Tennessee, Associated Press, October 3, 2007.Leonard Doyle, Anger over Iraq and Bush prompts calls for secession from the US , Independent, UK, October 4, 2007.WDEF News 12 Video report on Secessionist Convention , October 3, 2007. News stories about the Second North American Secessionist Convention in 2007 mentioned the controversial Southern Poverty Law Center's allegations that the other co- sponsor, The League of the South, was a \"racist hate group.\" Sale responded, \"They call everybody racists. There are, no doubt, racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt, racists everywhere.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center later criticized the New York Times' October 2007 Peter Applebombe interview of Sale for not covering its allegations.Mark Potok, New York Times Feature on Sale Left Out a Fact or Two, October 23, 2007.
