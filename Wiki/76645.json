 "text": "Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson, born Martha Wayles (October 30, 1748 â€“ September 6, 1782) was the only wife of her second husband, Thomas Jefferson. She was a widow at her second wedding, as her first husband had died young. When her second husband, Jefferson, was Governor of Virginia, she served as First Lady of Virginia from 1779 to 1781. The Jeffersons had six children together. Only two daughters survived to adulthood, and only one past the age of 25. Weakened by childbirth, Martha Jefferson died several months after the birth of her last child, twenty years before her husband became the third President of the United States. At her wishes, he never married again. ==Other websites== * Colonial Williamsburg: Interview of Martha Jefferson, YouTube * Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson , Monticello: For accurate, up-to-date information written and moderated by historians at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. * Martha Jefferson at Find-A-Grave * \"Martha Jefferson\", First Lady Biography Category:1748 births Category:1782 deaths Category:18th-century American people Category:Thomas Jefferson Category:People from Virginia Category:Deaths in childbirth",
