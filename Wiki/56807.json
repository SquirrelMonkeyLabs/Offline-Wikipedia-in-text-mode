Its systematic name is α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D-fructofuranose. It is best known for its role in human nutrition and is formed by plants but not by higher organisms. ==Physical and chemical properties== Pure sucrose is most often prepared as a fine, white, odorless crystalline powder with a pleasing, sweet taste. ==References== == Other websites == *Computational Chemistry Wiki *Nomenclature of Carbohydrates *3d Images of Sucrose Category:Carbohydrates Category:Organic compounds Category:Sweeteners",
