 "text": "An Ollie is a basic skateboarding trick. It is when the person riding the board leaps into the air with the board still attached to their feet. No hands are used; the board is moved into the air by kicking the back of the board down so the front is raised. From there it uses a combination of grip and momentum to keep the board with the rider. Category:Skateboarding",
