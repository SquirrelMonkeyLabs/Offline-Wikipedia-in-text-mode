He makes her think that they were Connor's reasons (\"If I Could Tell Her\"). Evan, Alana, and Jared found \"The Connor Project\". Its purpose is to remember Connor. The Murphys support the idea (\"Disappear\"). Evan gives an inspirational speech during the start of The Connor Project. It goes viral.

He gives Evan a new baseball glove (\"To Break In A Glove\"). Zoe tells Evan that she wants their relationship to be only about them. She doesn't want it to be about Connor (\"Only Us\"). Heidi finds out about the lies Evan made. Evan fights with her. He tells her that he likes being with the Murphy family. He says that Heidi is never there for him, but the Murphys are. Alana finds that some things in the fake emails (which she thinks are real) don't match up. Jared threatens to tell people about Evan's lies (\"Good For You\"). Evan decides that he needs to tell the Murphys the truth. He thinks about all that he will lose (\"For Forever (Reprise)\"). Evan shows Alana his letter. She thinks that it is Connor's suicide note. Alan posts it online. People start blaming the Murphys for Connor's suicide (\"You Will Be Found (Reprise)\"). Evan tells the Murphys the truth about the lies he made.
