The hoard (a hidden supply of things) was reported in 2021. It was excavated (dug up) by archaeologists in 2022. The analysis of the collection was reported in March of 2025. Experts think that the breaking and burning of the things was a show of power. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9241dq40qo There are more than 800 things. The collection dates to the first century A.D. hhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/melonsby-hoard-iron- age-yorkshire-b2720611.html The things found included parts \"of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.\" Other things in the hoard were spears and very large bowls (cauldrons) https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9241dq40qo This Iron Age find is one of the largest ever found in England. It suggests that the leaders in northern England were just as powerful as those in southern England. https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9241dq40qo \"A selection of objects from the hoard will be on display at the Yorkshire Museum from 25 March 2025.\" https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9241dq40qo ==References==",
