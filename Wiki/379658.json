When he was a boy, he went to a summer camp \"Camp Crystal Lake\" where he was bullied because of his appearance. He had a deformed face and body. They threw him into the lake and he drowned. It was later discovered he survived and became a killer after a teenager killed his mother, Pamela Voorhees. In the sequel to the Friday the 13th, he wears a tan colored hood, so that nobody could see his face. It wasn't until in the third movie he wore a hockey mask and since then he wore that hockey mask throughout the series. He uses a machete to kill the teenagers who come to Camp Crystal Lake. He later had a battle with Freddy Krueger in Freddy vs. Jason. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Many Faces of Jason â€“ a look at the various shots of Jason behind the mask Category:Fictional American people Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1980 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Horror movie characters Category:Friday the 13th (franchise) Category:Villains",
