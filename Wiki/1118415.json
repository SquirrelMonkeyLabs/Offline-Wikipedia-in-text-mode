 "text": "Area code 814 and 582 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) serving the state of Pennsylvania in the United States. They cover the central and northwestern parts of Pennsylvania, including cities such as Erie, Altoona, University Park (the location of the Penn State main campus), and State College. Area code 814 was established in 1947 as one of the original area codes assigned to Pennsylvania. For many years, it remained unchanged and covered a large geographic area. A second area code 582 was first announced in 2012 as a split, however, the implementation was held off until 2021, at which point, the plan was changed into an overlay instead of a split. 814",
