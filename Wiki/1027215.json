 "text": "Mammography is an x-ray of the breast. It is used to look for things that may be in a breast like a tumor. These images are viewed by radiologists for abnormal findings. A mammogram uses lower powered x-rays when compared to x-rays of bones. Other tests are often used along with mammograms. These are ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography (PEM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography. Mammography has resulted in a 30 percent drop in the U.S. cancer death rate. Mammography became widespread in the 1980s. == References == Category:Medical imaging",
