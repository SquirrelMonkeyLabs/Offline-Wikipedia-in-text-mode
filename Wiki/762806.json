 "text": "Robert Knight \"Bob\" Andras (21 February 1921 – 17 November 1982) was a Canadian politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada from 1965 to 1980. He was a part of the Liberal Party during this time. He represented two electoral areas in Ontario. They were Port Arthur and Thunder Bay—Nipigon. Andras was from Lachine, Quebec. He moved to Port Arthur, Ontario to work in a car dealership. As a politician, Andras was a part of the cabinet of Canada many different times. Most of the time, this was when Pierre Trudeau was the Prime Minister. He was Minister without Portfolio from 1968 to 1971, Minister of State for Urban Affairs from 1971 to 1972, the Minister of Status of Women from 1971 to 1974, Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs in 1972, Minister of Manpower and Immigration from 1972 to 1976, President of the Treasury Board from 1976 to 1978, and Minister of State for Economic Development from 1978 to 1979. For the 1980 federal election, he said he wouldn't try to be elected again. One of the most important things Andras did was help the Immigration Act, 1976 become a law. This was when he was the Minister of Manpower and Immigration. The law replaced the Immigration Act of 1952. The law made sure that there was a minimum amount of immigrants Canada let in, and that immigrants would be let in without discriminating on their ethnicity, gender, or country they came from. Andras also tried to work with Jean Chrétien to help with making public policy of the First Nations people. Andras died on 17 November 1982 in Vancouver, British Columbia. This is after he fought cancer for a year. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1921 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Privy Councillors (Canada) Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Cancer deaths in British Columbia Category:Politicians from Ontario",
