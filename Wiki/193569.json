At first, OneNote let people type notes, record audio and video clips, and turn written notes into text. Microsoft made it more powerful in 2007 and 2010, and keeps improving it today. Now, users can add files, write math equations, save web pages, and draw using a stylus or their finger. People can download OneNote on their computers, cell phones, and tablets, or use OneNote on the Internet. == Notes == == References == Category:Microsoft Office",
