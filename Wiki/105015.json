 "text": "The International General Certificate of Secondary Education, or IGCSE, is an international exam for school students, offered by Cambridge Assessment International Education. It is typically taken by 14 to 16-year-olds, and it makes students ready for more academic work, including moving to A-Level and AS-Level study. The IGCSE is recognised as the same quality as the UK GCSE. IGCSE courses cover subjects from a variety of areas: Languages, Humanities, Social Sciences, Mathematics, Creative, Technical and Vocational. Most subjects can be studied at two levels of ability, either an easier level or a harder level. This is so that the IGCSE is appropriate for students with different levels of ability. It is planned to be appropriate for students whose first language may not be English, and this is seen in all the tests for the IGCSE. ==Subjects available== The following is a list of subjects for which IGCSEs are available: * Accounting * Afrikaans as a first language * Afrikaans as a second language * Agriculture * Arabic as a first language * Arabic as a second language * Art * Art and Design * Bangladesh Studies * Biology * Business Studies * Chemistry * Child Development * Chinese as a first language * Chinese (Mandarin) as a second language * Computer Studies * Commerce * Czech as a first language * Drama * Design & Technology * Development Studies * Dutch as a first language * Dutch as a second language * Economics * English Language * English Literature * English as a second language (ESL) * Environmental Management * Food and Nutrition * French as a first language * French as a second language * Geography * German as a first language * German as a second language * Greek as a second language * Hindi as a First Language * History * Human Anatomy * Indonesian as a second language * Information and Communication Technology * Information Technology * IsiZulu as a second language * Japanese as a first language * Japanese as a second language * Korean as a first language * Latin * Malay as a second language * Mathematics * Mathematics – Additional * Music * ORACLE * Pakistan Studies * Physical Education * Physical Science * Physics * Portuguese as a first language * Portuguese as a second language * Punjabi * Religious Studies * Russian as a first language * Science – Combined * Sciences – Co-ordinated (Double Award) * Sociology * Spanish as a first language * Spanish as a second language * Spanish Literature * Thai as a first language * Thai as a second language * Travel and Tourism * Turkish as a First language * Urdu * Sinhala This list, along with more information, is also available on the Cambridge International website. == References == ==Related pages== *GCSE⁣ – GCSEs in the UK. *List of GCSE subjects. *Advanced levels (A-levels) - Exams taken after GCSEs in the UK.
