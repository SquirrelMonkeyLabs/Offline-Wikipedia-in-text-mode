 "text": "This is a list of children of U.S. presidents with stepchildren, adopted children, and alleged illegitimate children included. Full names are given including middle, maiden and married names. This list also includes the children's spouses and any known children they had and a “?” for an unknown number of children. Presidential children have been studied individually, and as a group. As individuals, they are more often notable than most individuals: they know many political and social leaders and are part of the richer, upper classes. They are more likely to be viewed as a part of celebrity culture. Also, as individuals they frequently have significant influence on other notable family members. A child who may appear otherwise non-notable may have affected the parent's beliefs or performance. == George Washington and Martha Dandridge Custis Washington == No children together.
