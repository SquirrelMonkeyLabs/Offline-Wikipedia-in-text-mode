 "text": "Milo (stylised as MILO) is a chocolate and malt powder from Australia that is mixed with milk or hot water to make a drink. It was first sold at the Sydney Royal Easter Show in Sydney, New South Wales. It is popular in many other countries in Australia, Oceania, South America, and certain parts of Africa and Asia. The name comes from the famous ancient Greek wrestler Milo of Croton, after his legendary strength. It was invented by Australian Thomas Mayne in 1934. It is now made by Nestlé. == Controversy == Nestle have been financially helping nutritionists creating a false scientific report about their products, according to a surprising report published in the New York Times in December 2017. Mindvalley's founder and CEO shared a video that drew the attention of millions of people around the world. The CEO discussed the New York Times article and lambasted Nestlé for selling sugary goods as nutritious food. He used Milo as an example, stating that he was advised to drink two to three glasses of the malt drink to help him improve his athletic performance. However, he pointed out that 'a whopping 40% of Milo is made up of pure sugar!' and 'that's not even the worst part' as he goes on to say in the video. He also stated that sugar isn't the only harmful ingredient in Milo, mentioning maltodextrin as another food additive to avoid. Maltodextrin may cause allergic reactions, weight gain, gas, flatulence, and bloating. Maltodextrin may also cause a rash or skin irritation, asthma, cramping, or difficulty breathing. In the Philippines, MILO has been reportedly spreading false marketing ads in television and in the Internet claiming that MILO can cure \"Energy Gap\", a false (made up) disease, claiming 4 out of 5 kids in the Philippines suffers. == Related pages == * Nesquik ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1930s establishments in Australia Category:Drinks Category:Nestlé",
