It was based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. The film focuses on the World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who did not carry or use a weapon or firearm of any kind. This was because he was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian.

Andrew Garfield stars as Doss, with Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, and Vince Vaughn in supporting roles. The movie was released in the United States on November 4, 2016.
