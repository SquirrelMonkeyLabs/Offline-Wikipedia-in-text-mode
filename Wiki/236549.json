The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara. ==Related pages== * Emperor of Japan * List of emperors of Japan * Japanese imperial family tree == References == Category:Emperors of Japan",
