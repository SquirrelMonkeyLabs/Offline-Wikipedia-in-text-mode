 "text": "Euler's identity, sometimes called Euler's equation, is this equation: e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0 It features the following mathematical constants: *\\pi, pi *:\\pi \\approx 3.14159 *e, Euler's Number *:e \\approx 2.71828 *i, imaginary unit *:i = \\sqrt{-1} It also features three of the basic mathematical operations: addition, multiplication and exponentiation. Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler. It is not clear that he invented it himself.Sandifer, C. Edward 2007. Euler's greatest hits. Mathematical Association of America, p. 4. Respondents to a Physics World poll called the identity \"the most profound mathematical statement ever written\", \"uncanny and sublime\", \"filled with cosmic beauty\" and \"mind- blowing\". == Mathematical proof of Euler's Identity using Taylor Series == Many equations can be written as a series of terms added together. This is called a Taylor series. The exponential function e ^{x} can be written as the Taylor series e ^{x} = 1 + x + {x^{2}\\over{2!}} + {x^{3}\\over{3!}} + {x^{4}\\over{4!}} \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {x^{n}\\over n!} As well, the sine function can be written as \\sin{x} = x - {x^{3} \\over 3!} + {x^5 \\over 5!} - {x^{7} \\over 7!} \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {(-1)^{n}\\over (2n+1)!} {x^{2n+1}} and cosine as \\cos{x} = 1 - {x^{2} \\over 2!} + {x^4 \\over 4!} - {x^{6} \\over 6!} \\cdots = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty {(-1)^{n}\\over (2n)!} {x^{2n}} Here, we see a pattern take form. e^{x} seems to be a sum of sine and cosine's Taylor series, except with all of the signs changed to positive. The identity we are actually proving is e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i \\sin(x). So, on the left side is e^{ix}, whose Taylor series is 1 + ix - {x^{2} \\over 2!} - {ix^{3} \\over 3!} + {x^{4} \\over 4!} + {ix^{5} \\over 5!} \\cdots We can see a pattern here, that every second term is i times sine's terms, and that the other terms are cosine's terms. On the right side is \\cos(x) + i \\sin(x), whose Taylor series is the Taylor series of cosine, plus i times the Taylor series of sine, which can be shown as: ( 1 - {x^{2} \\over 2!} + {x^{4} \\over 4!} \\cdots) + (ix - {ix^{3} \\over 3!} + {ix^{5} \\over 5!}\\cdots) if we add these together, we have 1 + ix - {x^{2} \\over 2!} - {ix^{3} \\over 3!} + {x^{4} \\over 4!} + {ix^{5} \\over 5!} \\cdots Therefore, e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i \\sin(x) Now, if we replace x with \\pi, we have: e^{i\\pi} = \\cos(\\pi) + i \\sin(\\pi) Since we know that \\cos(\\pi) = -1 and \\sin(\\pi) = 0, we have: *e^{i\\pi} = -1 *e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0 which is the statement of Euler's identity. == Related pages == * −1 (number) * Euler's formula == References == Category:Complex analysis pl:Wzór Eulera#Tożsamość Eulera",
