It passed over South Korea, Japan, Alaska, Canada, and the contiguous United States. The American and Canadian militaries said that the balloon was for surveillance. The Chinese government said that it was a civilian meteorological research airship blown off course. On February 3, the United States Department of Defense said a second Chinese balloon was passing over Latin America, which China also said belonged to it. The balloon was shot down on February 4, by the United States Air Force, in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of South Carolina on orders from U.S. President Joe Biden. ==Related pages== *List of high-altitude thing incidents in 2023 ==References== Category:2023 in Asia Category:2023 in the United States Category:2023 in Canada Category:2020s in China Category:2020s in international relations Category:February 2023 events Category:January 2023 events Category:2020s in military history",
