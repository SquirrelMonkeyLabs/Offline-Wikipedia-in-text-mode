 "text": "ALF is an American sitcom television series that aired on NBC from September 22, 1986, to March 24, 1990. The title character is Gordon Shumway, a sarcastic, friendly alien nicknamed ALF, who crash-lands in the garage of the suburban middle-class Tanner family. The series stars Max Wright as father Willie Tanner, Anne Schedeen as mother Kate Tanner, and Andrea Elson and Benji Gregory as their children, Lynn and Brian Tanner. ALF was performed by puppeteer Paul Fusco, who co-created the show with Tom Patchett. ALF originally ran for four seasons and made 99 episodes. The series ended with an unresolved cliffhanger, but the later TV movie, Project ALF, gave a series finale for the franchise. In August 2018, Warner Bros. Television announced development of an ALF reboot. These plans were cancelled in November 2018. ==References== Category:American sitcoms Category:1986 American television series debuts Category:1990 American television series endings Category:English-language television programs",
