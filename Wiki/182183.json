It is often played to announce the arrival of an important person, such as a king, queen or presidential leader. Fanfares are usually played by trumpets or French horns and other brass instruments, often with drums. The word \"fanfare\" can also mean an event with a high amount of publicity, even if there is no actual music. ==History== Fanfares began in the Middle Ages. Modern movies often show trumpets playing fanfares in ancient Rome, but there is little evidence that this ever happened. In the 18th century France, the fanfare was a piece of music with energy and repeated notes. Modern fanfares come from the 19th century in Britain where they were written for important state events such as the crowning of a king or queen.
