 "text": "The Gannoruwa shrub frog (Pseudophilautus zorro) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. People have seen it near Kandy and in the Knuckles Forest Reserve, 500-800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 19-23 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 22-30 mm. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color, and its belly has dark brown color on it. The frogs in this species can look different from each other. They can be light brown, pale, green, or yellow. Scientists say this is to make the frog harder to see. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists think this is because human beings build things in places where the frog lives and because of chemicals meant to kill pests and meant to make plants grow. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
