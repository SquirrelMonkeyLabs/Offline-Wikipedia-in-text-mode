 "text": "Transnistria (also called Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, PMR; ), is a separatist country in Eastern Europe. This means that it claims to be a separate country from Moldova but this is not legally true. Most countries have no diplomatic relations with it. Transnistria is the only state to still use the hammer and sickle symbol on its flag. Russia has a big influence on the territory. Between 1.500 and 2.000 Russian soldiers are stationed on the territory. In addition, there may be up to 10.000 paramilitary troops. Moldovans, Russians, and Ukrainians make up about a third of the population each. The capital and largest city is Tiraspol. == History == The area was part of the Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union. It was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. Transnistria was officially formed between 1990, when the Soviet government established the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in that area in hopes that it would remain if Moldova became independent. Moldova did become independent of the Soviet Union and claimed Transnistria as part of its territory. Transnistria declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a \"frozen conflict\" area. Currently, no state recognizes Transnistria and most countries agree that it is officially part of Moldova. As of 2024's first week, Russia has stopped selling gas to Moldova; In Transnistria, homes lost electricity for three hours at a time in rolling power cuts.https://www.kyivpost.com/post/44918. Retrieved 2024-01-05 == Recognition == There is argument about whether Transnistria is really a country or not. It is recognized by two partly recognized breakaway countries: Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It was also recognized by the Republic of Artsakh. The area continues to claim independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries. Many countries also think that Transnistria is a puppet state of Russia. In a vote on 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the area the \"Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester\". == Geography == Transnistria is landlocked and is located between Moldova and Ukraine. The climate is humid continental with subtropical characteristics. Transnistria has warm summers and cool to cold winters. Precipitation is unvarying all year round, although with a slight increase in the summer months. == Politics == Transnistria is a presidential republic, with the President of Transnistria being both the head of state and also shares the position of head of government with the Chairman of the Government. The legislature is the Supreme Council, which has 43 members. There is disagreement over if elections in Transnistria are free. === Divisions === Transnistria is divided into five districts and two municipalities. The districts are: Cameca District, Rîbnița District, Dubăsari District, Grigoriopol District and Slobozia District. The two municipalities are Tiraspol and Bender, although Bender is not actually part of Transnistria's define territory. == Notes == == References == Category:Moldova * Category:Puppet states",
