 "text": "Alice in Wonderland, also referred to as Alice for short, is a 1951 American animated fantasy adventure movie produced by Walt Disney and based on the 1865 story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. It is the thirteenth Disney animated classic. It includes the voices of Kathryn Beaumont (who also voiced Wendy Darling in the 1953 Disney movie Peter Pan) as Alice, and Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter. Alice in Wonderland was the first Disney animated movie to have ending credits (in this movie they contain the cast of characters shown in the film). A sequel of the film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, was planned in London on January 24, 1952, New York City on January 26, 1952 and the United States on March 14, 1952, but it was never released. == The story == A young girl named \"Alice\" is bored with her history lesson given by her sister Lorina. She, along with her kitten known as Dinah, sneaks away and dreams a world full of nonsense. However, Alice sees the unusual White Rabbit, who is holding a large golden pocket watch and running off in a hurry. Curious to find out where the Rabbit is going, Alice follows him down the rabbit hole where her adventure in Wonderland of Underland begins. While changing sizes from big to small and meeting bizarre people, which include the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Queen of Hearts, the King of Hearts and the Jack of Hearts, Alice is tired from her adventure in Wonderland and wishes to go home. ==Voice cast== * Kathryn Beaumont as Alice * Ed Wynn as Mad Hatter * Richard Haydn as Caterpillar * Sterling Holloway as Cheshire Cat * Jerry Colonna as March Hare * Verna Felton as Queen of Hearts * J.
