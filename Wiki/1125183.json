 "text": "IC 3418 is a dwarf irregular galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It is known for its tidal tail, which formed after the galaxy collided with the Virgo Cluster about 54 million light years from Earth. The galaxy has many starburst regions. The galaxy is thought to be changing from a dwarf irregular galaxy into a dwarf elliptical galaxy. == Starburst regions == As the galaxy moves through the intracluster medium (hot gas) of the Virgo Cluster, it pulls gas away from the galaxy leaving it with less gas. The gas that is left in the tidal tail collects and forms starburst regions behind the galaxy. == References == Category:Dwarf galaxies Category:Irregular galaxies",
