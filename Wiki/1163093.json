 "text": "Lower Primary School is the first stage of basic education in Hungary, typically lasting 4 years, though this can vary. In Hungarian primary schools with eight grades, students in the first four grades (1st to 4th) are taught by qualified teachers who handle all subjects in a class-teaching system. In larger schools with good resources, subject-specific teaching might start in the lower primary phase, particularly for subjects like math, foreign languages, and skills-based subjects. The curriculum is structured to build progressively from one year to the next, ensuring continuity across grades. Teaching methods take into account the age-specific needs of the students. Due to Hungary's settlement structure, many schools only have lower primary education, and in these cases, it's common to have combined classes where different grade levels are taught together.
