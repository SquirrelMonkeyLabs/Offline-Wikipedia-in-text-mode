A mounted skeleton of the giant plesiosaur Kronosaurus. Breviora 112: 1-15. However, a recent study compared fossil specimens of Kronosaurus to other pliosaurs. The Harvard reconstruction may have included too many vertebrae, exaggerating its length. Its true length was probably only 9-10.9 meters (30-36 feet).Kear B.P. 2003.
