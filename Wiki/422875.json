 "text": "Institut Le Rosey, commonly known simply as Le Rosey, is a boarding school in Rolle, Switzerland. It has ~400 students aged 7 to 18. It was started by Paul- Ã‰mile Carnal in 1880 and is Switzerland's oldest private school. Royalty from around the world have been students. No more than 10% of the students come from any one country. Students applying to be seniors must be able to work in English and French. Fees: ~ $136,000 per annum. This is a school for the rich international set. Before the introduction of the 10% quota (where no more than 10% of the student body may come from one country) different nationalities made up the majority of students at Le Rosey. In the 1950s and 1960s, most students were Americans, Italians, and Greeks. In the 1970s came the Arabs and Iranians. In the 1980s came Japanese and Koreans, and in the 1990s came the Russians. During the 1990s, came the children of Russian oligarchs, who made up a third of the student body. They \"terrorized\" other students, which resulted in the withdrawal of at least one non-Russian student. Since then, quotas have been applied. ==Music== The school has three orchestras and two choirs. January to March the school moves to Gstaad. There they do winter sports like skiing every day. For junior boarders it costs CHF 78,300 a year ($85855). It has been called the world's most expensive school. All subjects are taught in English and French. ==References== Category:Schools in Switzerland Category:1880 establishments in Europe Category:Nyon (district)",
