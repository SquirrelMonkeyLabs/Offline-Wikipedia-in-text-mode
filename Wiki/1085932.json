 "text": "LASIK, short for laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is a refractive surgery aimed at correcting myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism by reshaping the cornea using a laser or microkeratome. It's considered a significant advancement over older procedures like radial keratotomy. Similar techniques include PRK and LASEK. For individuals unsuitable for LASIK or PRK due to factors like thin corneas, phakic intraocular lens implantation offers an alternative. Globally, over 40 million LASIK procedures were performed from 1991 to 2016. == References == == Other websites == * https://www.pristyncare.com/treatment/lasik-eye-surgery/ Category:Diseases and disorders of the eye",
