 "text": "Crépy-en-Valois is a commune in the Hauts-de-France region in the Oise department in the north of France. The two listed historical monuments are the Saint-Thomas-de-Canterbury collegiate church and the Porte de Paris. The first one goes back to its oldest elements in the 12th century, when the city prospered under the guidance of the Dukes of Valois. The second one dates from 1788-1792 and is located rue Charles de Gaulle. == History == The origins of the city of Crépy-en-Valois remain uncertain. During 10th century, the first lords of Crépy fortified the area, this rocky promontory overlooking the streams of Taillandiers and Sainte- Agathe. The castrum didn't stop developing since then: firstly under the impetus of the Counts of Amiens Valois, who founded the Abbey Saint Arnoul in 1008, then with the Counts of Vermandois, particularly Philip d'Alsace and his wife Elizabeth who founded in 1182 in the suburbs a collegiate dedicated to Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, who was assassinated in his cathedral. Civil and religious protection drew a more and more numerous population. Prosperity settled thanks to the pilgrimages and grew even after 1213, the date of the reattachment of Valois to the French crown. In 1790, the revolutionary district was created. Thereafter, it became an administrative center of the canton, arrondissement of Senlis, department of Oise. The 19th century announced winds of change. The city expanded to the East with new neighborhoods. The arrival of the railroad facilitated the establishment of prosperous industries and therefore the installation of a workforce. The wars of 1914 and 1939 wounded city by multiple bombings; but the successive mayors knew how to look after and maintain the city's dignity and dynamism. ==References== Category:Communes in Oise",
