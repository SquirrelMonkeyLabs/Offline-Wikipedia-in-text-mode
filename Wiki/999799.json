 "text": "Flip cup is a drinking game. Players get a (usually plastic) cup with a drink, most often, beer. They drink the cup, and then place it on the edge of the table. They then try to flip the cup, so that it lands opening down on the table. The first game is said to have been first played in Hoboken, New Jersey in the 1980's, and rapidly became popular. Because players need to drink every cup before trying to flip it, they can get drunk very fast. == References == Category:Drinking games",
