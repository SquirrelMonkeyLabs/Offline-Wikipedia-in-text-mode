 "text": "3 World Trade Center (also known as 175 Greenwich Street) is a skyscraper built as part of the World Trade Center reconstruction in New York City. It is located at 175 Greenwich Street. The new 3 World Trade Center opened in June 2018. It is 1,079 ft (329 m) high, with 80 stories. It is taller than the Empire State Building's roof and, as of 2023, is the ninth tallest building in New York City as measured to its pinnacle. The building was designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, and is managed by Silverstein Properties. The building is the second building with this name. The original 3 World Trade Center was called the Marriott World Trade Center. Opened in July 1981 as the Vista International Hotel, the building was a hotel located in the southwest corner of the World Trade Center complex. It was destroyed in the September 11 attacks, alongside the other World Trade Center buildings. 3 World Trade Center was originally going to be 1,240 feet (378 m) tall. Construction of the building started in January 2008. Constuction stopped as there was no anchor tenant (a big business that gets a lot of customers). In 2014, construction continued after a company called GroupM became the anchor tenant. In August 2016, the concrete core of the building topped out, followed by the steel structure in October. The building opened on June 11, 2018. ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in New York City Category:September 11 attacks Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
