 "text": "Thrust vectoring is the ability of an aircraft to change the direction of its thrust to control its attitude and motion. It is achieved by using movable nozzles that can deflect the exhaust gas from the engine(s) in various directions. This allows the aircraft to perform maneuvers that would be impossible with conventional aerodynamic controls alone. Category:Aviation",
