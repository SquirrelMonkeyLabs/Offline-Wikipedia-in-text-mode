 "text": "The Watermelon stereotype is the stereotypical view that black people can be made happy easily; they only need a watermelon and a little rest for their happiness. The stereotype was perpetuated in minstrel shows often depicting African Americans as ignorant and workshy, given to song and dance and inordinately fond of watermelon. This stereotype is common in the United States, and probably goes back to the times of slavery: The people who were in favour of slavery wanted to show that black people were simple-minded and only needed few things for their happiness. == References == Category:African- American history Category:Psychology Category:Racism",
