He used to organize the local religious youth into a study group at the village’s Islamic library.

It is also that the group stands humiliated in front of a Lebanese public that had already come to resent Hezbollah [for the way in which they do politics].\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Hasan Nasrallah from Al Jazeera * Category:Lebanese Muslims Category:Lebanese nationalists Category:Lebanese politicians Category:Lebanese terrorists",
