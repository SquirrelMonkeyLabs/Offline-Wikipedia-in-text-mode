 "text": "The tiny bubble-nest frog or horned bush frog (Gracixalus supercornutus) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and Laos. People have seen it between 1100 and 1905 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests on hills. The frog sits on plants over water that does not move. The female frog lays eggs on leaves. Sometimes the male frog watches the eggs. The eggs hatch into tadpoles. Scientists believe this frog may be in a little danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. Human beings cut down forests to build roads and farms and get wood to build with. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Bach Ma National Park, Ba Na National Park, Kon Ka Kinh National Park, and Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve in Vietnam and Xe Xap National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Hin Nam No National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
