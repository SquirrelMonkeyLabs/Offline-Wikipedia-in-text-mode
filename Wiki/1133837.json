His music style mixes jazz, Jewish cantor music, European classical traditions, and experimental music. He is known as one of the most original composers today. Yedid's work focuses on interfaith dialogue and mixing different cultures. He is inspired by Middle Eastern culture, ancient rituals, Arabic music, and non-Western music styles. Yitzhak Yedid also performs sacred Judaeo-Sephardic and Middle Eastern music in piano concerts. == Biography == Yedid was born in Jerusalem and since 2008 he calls Australia home. He studied in Jerusalem (Rubin Academy), Boston, MA (New England Conservatory) and Melbourne (Monash University). His expertise as a composer is in the integration of non-European musical elements, including improvisation, with Western practice. His compositions explore new forms of integrating classical Arabic music, Arabic- influenced Jewish music and contemporary Western art music. Yedid is a Sidney Myer Creative Fellow and Gallop House Composer in Residence. His awards include the top two prizes in Israel for classical performers and composers: the Prime Minister's Prize for Composers (2007) and the Landau Prize for Performing Arts (2009).
