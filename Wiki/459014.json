The blast claimed 1 life and injured 111 people, while another person died of a heart attack. It was the first of four bombings committed by Eric Robert Rudolph.\"Eric Rudolph lays out the arguments that fueled his two- year bomb attacks\"; By Doug Gross; ASSOCIATED PRESS; SignonSanDiego.com by the Union-Tribune; April 14, 2005 Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bomb before detonation and cleared most of the spectators out of the park. Rudolph, a carpenter and handyman, had detonated three pipe bombs inside an ALICE Pack. He was against abortion, and he wanted to force the cancellation of the Olympics. After the bombings, Jewell was implicated as a suspect by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The news media focused aggressively on him as the presumed culprit. However, in October 1996, Jewell was cleared of all charges. Following three more bombings in 1997, Rudolph was identified by the FBI as the suspect. In 2003, Rudolph was arrested and tried before being convicted two years later. Rudolph was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for his crimes. ==References== Category:1996 crimes Category:1996 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1996 Summer Olympics Category:1990s explosions Category:1990s murders in the United States Category:Atlanta Category:Explosions in North America Category:July 1996 events Category:Terrorist attacks in the United States Category:Terrorist incidents in the 1990s",
