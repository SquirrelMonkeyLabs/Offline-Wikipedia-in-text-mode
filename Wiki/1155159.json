 "text": "YouTube Poop (YTP) also known simply as a poop, is a type of mashup or video edit created by remixing/editing preexisting media sources, often carrying subcultural meaning into a new video for humorous, satirical, obscene, absurd, and profane—as well as annoying, confusing, or dramatic purposes. Originally from the United States, poops are now produced all over the world. The name can vary from country to country, with the country's acronym being used next to ‘YouTube Poop’; Brazilian poops, for example, use the name YouTube Poop BR, or YTPBR in its shortened form. There's also (YTPMV) or simply ‘YouTube Poop Music Video’, which is a musical genre that uses human voices, noises and robotic sounds. == History == YouTube Poop is a subset of remix culture, in which existing ideas and media are modified and reinterpreted to create new art and media in various contexts. Forms of remix culture existed long before the internet, with Luke Dormehl of DigitalTrends listing William Burroughs' cut-up technique and samples in hip-hop as examples. Dormehl also says that “aesthetically”, YouTube Poop is similar to MTV's “frenetic editing style” in the 1980s, which featured “fast, non-linear cuts” that focused less on character or plot than on evoking a feeling. == References == === Bibliography === * * * == Other Websites == Category:Internet memes Category:Internet culture Category:Internet slang Category:YouTube",
