 "text": "The Polish–Soviet War (February 1919 – March 1921) was an armed conflict between Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine against the Second Polish Republic and the Ukrainian People's Republic. It was for control of what is now Ukraine and part of Belarus. A formal peace treaty, the Peace of Riga, was signed on 18 March 1921. It divided the land between Poland and Soviet Russia. Much of the land that was given to Poland became part of the Soviet Union after World War II. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1919 in Europe Category:1920 in Europe Category:1921 in Europe Category:1910s in Poland Category:1920s in Poland Category:1920s in Ukraine Category:Russian Revolution Category:Wars involving Russia Category:Military of Ukraine Category:1910s conflicts Category:1920s conflicts",
