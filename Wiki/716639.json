 "text": "A statistical parameter or population parameter is an amount put into the probability distribution of a statistic or a random variable.. It can be thought of as a numbered amount of a trait of a statistical population or a statistical model.Everitt, B. S.; Skrondal, A. (2010), The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics, Cambridge University Press. A statistical parameter is different from its estimator in that the parameter is a fixed amount, while the value of an estimator changes according to some probability distribution. The notations \\theta (for the parameter) and \\hat{\\theta} (for the estimator) are often used to clarify this distinction. ==Related pages== *Parameter ==References== Category:Statistics Category:Economics",
