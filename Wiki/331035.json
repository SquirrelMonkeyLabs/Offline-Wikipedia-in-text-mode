 "text": "Pelvic fins or ventral fins are paired fins located on the ventral surface of fish. == Structure and function == === Structure === In actinopterygians, the pelvic fin consists of two bony girdles attached to bony radials. The lepidotrichia are positioned distally from the radials. === Function === A pelvic fin's function is to provide powered corrective forces. == Development == Unlike limb development in tetrapods, the pelvic fin bud emerges much later than the pectoral fin. == References == # Shibukawa, Koichi, Dinh Dac Tran, and Loi Xuan Tran. \"Phallostethus cuulong, a new species of priapiumfish (Actinopterygii: Atheriniformes: Phallostethidae) from the Vietnamese Mekong.\" Zootaxa 3363.1 (2012): 45-51.
