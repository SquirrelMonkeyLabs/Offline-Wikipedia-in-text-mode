S version for Amazon Luna was releaed in October 2020. The game was created by Playtonic Games. They are a group of people who used to work for Rare. Yooka- Laylee is a spiritual successor to the Banjo-Kazooie series. That series was released for the Nintendo 64 almost 20 years earlier. After years of planning to make a new game, Playtonic Games started a Kickstarter campaign that got a large amount of media coverage. It raised a record-breaking sum of over Â£2 million. The game follows chameleon Yooka and bat Laylee on their quest to get a magical book from an evil company. Yooka-Laylee got mixed reviews. Critics do not agree on the idea that being similar to its predecessors was enough to make it a successful game. Many felt that it was just taking advantage of nostalgia. Most critics agreed that it was very similar to earlier platformers. They also pointed out technical shortcomings and outdated gameplay. == References == Category:2017 video games Category:3D platformers Category:Action-adventure games Category:Crossover video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games about reptiles Category:Xbox One games Category:Windows games",
