They live in burrows and use grass, feathers, and wool, to create it. Seeds and food are extremely close inside because they donâ€™t want other animals to find their food source so that they can have enough food when it is time for winter. ==Looks== The Campbell's Russian hamster is a grayish color with a cream white belly and a dark stripe running down its back. There are 3 types of colors that have been identified. The collared, mottled, and the spot. They each vary and can be very different from another. ==References== *ADW. University of Michigan, n.d.
