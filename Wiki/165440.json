They played an important role in the Irish fight for independence from Britain. This helped stage the 1916 Easter Rising. == Formation == The IRB was started at the same time in Dublin and in New York in 1858. It was started by a number of men who had been connected with the 1848 rebellion in Ireland. They were a very mysterious organization. They believed the only way to get freedom for Ireland was by using force. == Other websites == * The Irish Republican Brotherhood, from the BBC History site * Irish Nationalism and Anglo-American Naturalization: The Settlement of the Expatriation Question 1865-1872 Category:History of Ireland Category:1858 establishments in Europe Category:Resistance to the British Empire Category:Irish republicanism Category:Rebel militia groups Category:1850s establishments in New York (state) Category:1858 establishments in the United States",
