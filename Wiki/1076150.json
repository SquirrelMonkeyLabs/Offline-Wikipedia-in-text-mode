 "text": "Transport engineering is a field of civil engineering, which is about planning transport systems. Sometimes it is also called transportation engineering. It uses technology and scientific principles to plan, functionally design, operate and manage facilities for any mode of transportation. It is about providing infrastructure for safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods. There are different subfields: * Planning and building road systems. This includes the idea that different types of roads have different purposes, and are not necessarily suited for all users. * Planning and building railroads. This includes questions where to put the track, and where the stations should be. * Planning and constructing waterways. It includes things like where to put ports or harbours, building canals, or improving rivers, * Planning and constructing airports Transport engineering can be studied at technical universities. Usually it is a specialization of a technical domain of study, such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering or urban planning. == References == Category:Transport Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Civil engineering",
