 "text": "HBO (an acronym for Home Box Office) is a Latin American subscription television channel of American origin that began operations on October 31, 1991. It broadcasts original series, documentaries, and blockbuster new releases. It is operated by Warner Bros. Discovery Latin America. ==History== In early 1991, Home Box Office, a subsidiary of the newly formed Time Warner, announced the possibility of launching an exclusive channel for the Latin American market. Following the success of the premium service for Hispanic audiences in the United States, between 1989 and 1990, Home Box Office announced a joint venture with the Venezuelan cable television company Omnivisión Multicanal to launch a premium subscription television channel. The joint venture eventually resulted in Home Box Office/Omnivisión Latinoamérica Entertainment (HBO - Ole, for short). HBO's Latin American channel began broadcasting on October 31, 1991, throughout Latin America, with the exception of Brazil. HBO Ole aired concerts, specials, sports, and series. It originally aired its programming 12 hours a day, later expanding to 18 hours in 1993. On November 1, 1994, it began broadcasting its programming 24 hours a day, initially on weekends. It was not until April 2, 1995, that it began broadcasting its programming 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In 2000, HBO Ole changed its name, removing the word \"Ole\" from the logo and becoming simply HBO. In May 2020, HBO Latin America Group was absorbed by WarnerMedia Latin America (formerly Turner Broadcasting System Latin America) after Ole Communications' shares in HBO were sold to the company. Its operations were merged with WarnerMedia, and its offices in Bogotá were relocated to Buenos Aires, Argentina. == Logo == File:HBO Ole logo.svg|1991-2000 File:HBO logo.svg|From 2000 == References == Category:Television channels in South America",
