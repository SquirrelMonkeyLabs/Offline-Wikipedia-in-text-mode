 "text": "The Buffalo Bisons are a Minor League Baseball team from Buffalo, New York. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Bisons are partnered with the Toronto Blue Jays, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Blue Jays. The Bisons played at a stadium called War Memorial Stadium from 1979 to 1987. In 1988, the Bats began to play at a new stadium called Sahlen Field. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1970s establishments in New York (state) Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Sports in Buffalo, New York Category:Toronto Blue Jays",
