The incident, which occurred around 12:20 p.m. local time, started in several containers likely holding hazardous materials like sodium perchlorate, used in missile fuel. It happened amid negotiations between the United States and Iran over Iran's ballistic missile program. ==Overview== Shahid Rajaee Port, Iran's largest, handles about 80 million tons of goods annually and is a key hub for the country’s maritime trade. Located near the Strait of Hormuz, about 23 kilometers west of Bandar Abbas, it is next to facilities operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The explosion occurred while Iranian and U.S. delegates were meeting to discuss Iran’s nuclear program. Before the talks, Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, warned that security services were on high alert due to previous sabotage and assassination attempts. == Casualties and emergency response == At least 25 people were killed in the explosion, while more than 800 others were injured. Six people were also reported missing. The Chinese consulate in Bandar Abbas said three Chinese nationals sustained light injuries. Emergency services, including the Iranian Red Crescent Society, dispatched rapid response teams to the scene. ==Related pages== * Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions ** 2015 Tianjin explosions, a series of explosions at the Port of Tianjin in China that killed 173 people and injured 798 ** 2022 Sitakunda fire, a fire and explosions at a container depot in Bangladesh that killed at least 47 people and injured around 450 ** PEPCON disaster, an ammonium perchlorate-related explosion * List of explosions#2000s * 2025 Isfahan explosion == References == Category:2025 disasters in Asia Category:2020s explosions in Asia Category:2020s fires in Asia Category:2020s disasters in Iran Category:April 2025 events Category:Hormozgan Province",
