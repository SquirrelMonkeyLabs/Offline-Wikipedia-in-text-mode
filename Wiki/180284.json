 "text": "Carlos José Castilho (27 November 1927 – 2 February 1987) was a Brazilian professional football player. He played for the Brazil national team. He made saves that seemed to be helped by luck for this reason he was nicknamed by his opponents Leiteria (Lucky man) and the Fluminense fans called him São Castilho (Saint Castilho). In 1952, he saved six penalties. Color blind, he felt he had an advantage in seeing the yellow balls red, even though he had more trouble with the white ones in the evening. Castilho is regarded as one of the greatest Brazilian goalkeepers of all time. ==Managerial career== After his playing career he became a trainer. In 1977 he led Operário (MS), a club from a smaller league to the semi-finals for the Brazilian national title. With Santos, he won in 1984 with Campeonato Paulista. ==Death== He committed suicide on February 2, 1987. ==Honours== ===Player=== ;Fluminense * Campeonato Carioca: 1951, 1959, 1964 *Torneio Rio – São Paulo: 1957, 1960 *Copa Rio: 1952 ;Paysandu * Campeonato Paraense: 1965 ;Brazil * World Cup: 1958, 1962runner up: 1950 * South American Championship runner-up: 1953, 1957, 1959 (Argentina) * Taça Oswaldo Cruz: 1950, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1962 * Copa Rio Branco: 1950 * Roca Cup: 1957, 1960 * Taça O'Higgins Cup: 1955, 1959, 1961 ===Coach=== ;Santos *Campeonato Paulista: 1984 ==References== Category:1927 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Footballers from Rio de Janeiro Category:Brazilian association football goalkeepers Category:Brazil at the 1950 FIFA World Cup Category:Brazil at the 1954 FIFA World Cup Category:Brazil at the 1958 FIFA World Cup Category:Brazil at the 1962 FIFA World Cup",
