 "text": "Troy McClure is a character in The Simpsons voiced by Phil Hartman. He first appeared in the episode \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\". McClure is a washed-up actor, usually shown doing low-level work, such as hosting infomercials and educational movies. He appears as the central character in \"A Fish Called Selma\", in which he marries Selma Bouvier to protect his career from failing and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also 'hosts' two episodes named \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\" and \"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\". McClure was based on B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman's murder on May 28, 1998, the character no longer appeared on the show, making his final appearance in the tenth season in \"Bart the Mother\". McClure is often cited as one of the series' most popular characters; in 2006 IGN ranked him first on their list of the \"Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters\". ==References== ==Other websites== *\"The Stellar Acting Career of Troy McClure\" at The Simpsons Archive * Category:The Simpsons characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1991 Category:Animated human characters",
