Metzger was known for directing popular artistic, adult-oriented films, including Camille 2000 (1969), Score (1974), The Lickerish Quartet (1970), The Image (1975) and The Opening of Misty Beethoven (1976). According to one film reviewer, Metzger's films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn, are noted for their \"lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle\". Another reviewer noted that his films were \"highly artistic â€” and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography\". Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. On March 31, 2017, Metzger died at the age of 88 in New York City. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Disease-related deaths in New York City Category:Movie directors from New York City",
