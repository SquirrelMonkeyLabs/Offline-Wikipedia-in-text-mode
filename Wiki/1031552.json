They are known for winning Melodifestivalen 2020 and were chosen to represent Sweden in Eurovision 2020. == Members == The group consisted of: * Ashley Haynes (born 19 January 1987 in Washington, D.C.) * Loulou Lamotte (born 16 April 1981 in Malm√∂) * Dinah Yonas Manna (born 5 September 1981 in Stockholm) * Founding member Paris Renita left the group in 2019. == History == As a four-member group, the Mamas performed the backing vocals for John Lundvik's song \"Too Late for Love\" in both Melodifestivalen and the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. The following year, the Mamas (now a three-member group) entered Melodifestivalen in their own right with the song \"Move\". They won the contest and were due to represent Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. However, the contest was cancelled in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Mamas returned to Melodifestivalen the following year with the song \"In the Middle\" in the hopes of representing Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021. However, they finished in third place. In 2023, the group announced that they were going to separate to focus on solo careers. However, they said that they would come back at some point in the future. == Sources == Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants Category:Swedish musical groups",
