 "text": "The Zero bar is a candy bar. It is composed of a combination of caramel, peanut and almond nougat covered with a layer of white chocolate fudge. Its outwardly white color — an unusual color for a candy bar — has become its trademark. The coating melted at a higher temperature than brown chocolates, making the bar a popular choice for summer vending in the pre-air conditioning South.
