 "text": "In 1939, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt moved Thanksgiving one week earlier than normal. He thought this would help increase retail sales during one of the final years of the Great Depression. This led to much upheaval and protest. Those upset by the change called the holiday Franksgiving. Thanksgiving (after 1941) takes place on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. ==References== Category:Thanksgiving Category:20th century in the United States Category:Franklin D.
