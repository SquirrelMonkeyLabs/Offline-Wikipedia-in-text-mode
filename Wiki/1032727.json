They work in many different industries - in retail, security, schools, distribution, the utilities, social care, the National Health Service, ambulance service and local government. It was made in 1982 when the National Union of General and Municipal Workers joined with the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers.
