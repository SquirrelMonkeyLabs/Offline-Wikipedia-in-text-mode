He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923 for his method of accurately measuring the electric charge through the Millikan oil drop experiment and for his work of the photoelectric effect. He was also the researcher on cosmic radiation. == Education == Millikan received the first-class bachelor's degree from Oberlin College in 1891 and a doctorate in physics from Columbia University in 1895. He was the first person to receive a doctorate from this university. == References and further reading == === Books === * Waller, John, \"Einstein's Luck: The Truth Behind Some of the Greatest Scientific Discoveries\".
