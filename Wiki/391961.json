 "text": "The Boeing 720 is a jet airliner. It has two rows of seats, which means that it is a narrow-body airliner. It has four engines. The Boeing 720 was designed by Boeing in the 1950s. It was based on the Boeing 707, but the 720 is shorter and cannot fly as far. The 720 first took off in November 1959. Airlines began to use it in July 1960. Two versions of the plane were made. The first one had Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet engines and was first used in 1960. The second one is called the 720B, and it has Pratt & Whitney JT3D turbofan engines. It was first used in 1961. Some 720s were changed to 720Bs. Only 154 Boeing 720s were built, but it still made Boeing a lot of money because it did not cost a lot to design. The Boeing 720 was replaced by the Boeing 727. ==Designing== ===Shorter range 707=== Boeing said it would make a new type of Boeing 707 in July 1957.Angelucci, Enzo; Paolo Matricardi and Adriano Zannino. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Civil Aircraft: From Leonardo da Vinci to the Present, p. 346. Edison, New Jersey US: Chartwell Books, 2001. . At first, the new plane was called the 707-020, but it was changed to 720. The Boeing 720 is shorter than the Boeing 707. The 720 had a lot of changes made to the outside of the plane. These changes helped the 720 fly faster than the 707−120.Frawley, Gerald. \"Boeing 720\". The International Directory of Civil Aircraft, 2003/2004. Fishwick, Act: Aerospace Publications, 2003. . It had four Pratt & Whitney JT3C-7 turbojet engines. The engines made of thrust each.Donald, David, ed. The Complete Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 1997. . At one point while the plane was being designed, it was called the 717-020. However, Boeing used the name \"717\" for a military jet, but this was changed to the MD-95 after Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.Lombardi, Michael. \"The first KC-135 rolled out 50 years ago this month.\" Historical Perspective, Start of a Proud Mission: Boeing Frontiers, July 2006. Retrieved: April 17, 2010. Since the plane was so similar to the Boeing 707, no prototype Boeing 720 was needed. Any new systems were tested on the Boeing 367-80.Pither 1998, p. 29. The first 720 took off on November 23, 1959. It was first used by United Airlines, on July 5, 1960. 65 720s were made.Boeing 720. Boeing ===More changes=== The 720B was a different type of 720. It had JT3D turbofan engines. These engines made of thrust each. The JT3D engines burned less fuel and could make more thrust. The first 720B took off on October 6, 1960. The first airline to use it was American Airlines in March 1961. 89 720Bs were made. American Airlines also changed some of their normal 720s to 720Bs.Pither 1998, p. 30 Since the Boeing 720 was so similar to the Boeing 707, it did not cost much to design. This meant that it still earned Boeing money, even though not many planes were sold. Boeing made 154 Boeing 720s and 720Bs from 1959 until 1967.\"Boeing 707/720 Short History.\" Boeing. Retrieved: December 27, 2009. ==Design== Although the Boeing 720 was similar to the Boeing 707-120, it was 9 ft (2.73 m) shorter. It was also lighter. ===Body=== The 707 had emergency exits over the wings. These are called over- wing emergency exits. The back over-wing exit was removed. Two extra over-wing exits could be put in so that the plane could hold more passengers. ===Wings=== The 720's wing was taken from the 707, but some changes were made to it. The 720 had the same wingspan as the 707-120. For the 720, the wing had something called a wing root glove.\"The Boeing 720\". Flight, August 19, 1960.The Ultimate Boeing 707 Guide Retrieved September 5, 2011. This glove helped the wing make less drag. ===Engines=== Although the 720 first had turbojet engines, the Pratt & Whitney JT3D was much more popular. The JT3D was a turbofan engine. 720s which had the JT3D were called 720Bs. American Airlines changed some of their normal 720s to 720Bs. The 720 used the engines to make air to pressurize the cabin. However, the engines could not make enough air to do this, so some small holes were put in above the engines for more air. ===Other equipment=== The Boeing 720 did not have an APU, so it needed power from the ground to power the plane until the engines were started (the engines could make electricity for the plane). ==History== The first Boeing 720 was for United Airlines. It first flew on November 23, 1959. United Airlines first used the plane on July 5, 1960. It flew from Los Angeles to Denver and then Chicago. American Airlines was the second airline to use the 720. The Boeing 720 was replaced by the Boeing 727 during the 1960s. The first 720 had its name changed to \"The Starship\". It was turned into a private plane used by rock bands. Led Zeppelin used it most, in the 1970s. A bar was put in, as well as beds, a shower, a lounge area, a TV and video cassette player.Film \"The Song Remains The Same\" Honeywell used the last Boeing 720 in the United States. It flew from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Honeywell used it for testing. Honeywell got rid of this plane on June 21 and 22, 2008.\"Resident Boeing 720B.\" visitingphx.com. Retrieved: December 27, 2009. Honeywell replaced their Boeing 720 with a Boeing 757. Pratt & Whitney Canada used the last 720 until 2010. It was used to test new engines.
