 "text": "In photography, exposure is used to mean two things. Photographic film or sensors have a certain senitivity. That means that a certain amount of light needs to be able to reach the film or sensor, before the image is correctly exposed. It is measured in units of lux-seconds (symbol lx â‹… s). An exposure can also refer to a photo exposed that way. Category:Photography",
