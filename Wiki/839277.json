 "text": ":For another species called the Guianan dwarf tree frog, see Dendropsophus goughi The Guianan dwarf tree frog or lesser tree frog (Dendropsophus minutus) is a frog that lives in the Guianas, Colombia, Trinidad, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, and Brazil. It lives in a very large part of South America. Scientists have seen it as high as 2000 meters above sea level and as low as at sea level. The male frogs sing for the female frogs from grass and shrubs near water and from plants growing up out of the water. Male frogs will fight each other over the best places to sing. The females lay eggs in water that does not move, like ponds and puddles. This frog lives in a very large part of South America, in places that are very different from each other, so the individual frogs are also different from each other. In 2014, a team of 30 scientists studied the mtDNA of this frog and found the whole species had 47 different groups in it. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
