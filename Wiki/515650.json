 "text": "In mammals and birds, sleep can be divided into two categories. In one of them, the eyes move rapidly. This is called REM-sleep (from rapid eye movement).Greenfield, Susan The human brain: a guided tour. Phoenix: ISBN 0-75380-155-8. Greenfield says (p72} \"\"Different animals display different amounts of REM. Reptiles do not display it at all, birds do occasionally, but all mammals, at least according to their EEG, would seem capable of dreaming. Most dreams take place in this phase. REM-sleep occurs normally at intervals throughout the night. The periods of REM-sleep increase in length in the second half of the night. REM-sleep was first discovered in 195253. The function of REM sleep is not well understood. Nathaniel Kleitman and his student Eugene Aserinsky defined rapid eye movement and linked it to dreams in 1953.Antrobus, John S. & Mario Bertini (eds) 1992. The neuropsychology of sleep and dreaming. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-0925-2 REM sleep was further described by researchers including William Dement and Michel Jouvet.Mort de Michel Jouvet, scientifique du rÃªve Parmeggiani, Pier Luigi 2011. Systemic homeostasis and poikilostasis in sleep: is REM sleep a physiological paradox? London: Imperial College Press. ISBN 978-1-94916-572-2 The other category, where this movement of the eyes does not happen, is called NREM-sleep (Non-REM sleep). Usually, dreams do not occur during this time. There are three or four stages of NREM-sleep. Stage I is just barely sleeping, or dozing. Stage II is also light sleep. Normally, in adult humans, about half of the time spent asleep is spent in light sleep. Stages III and IV are called deep sleep. Deep sleep is necessary for growth and healing. It can be quite difficult to awaken someone who is in stage III or stage IV sleep. Sometimes stages III and IV are combined and called stage III. Adult humans normally sleep in cycles of 90 to 110 minutes each. The night's sleep can be four or five of these cycles. Each cycle includes, in this order: stage I, stage II, stage III (IV), stage II and REM. The fact that birds and mammals both show REM and NREM sleep suggests that the trait evolved before the two groups diverged in their evolution. That suggests that the REM/NREM feature is both early and important in the evolution of land vertebrates. == REM and dreams == Rapid eye movement sleep is associated with dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common way to get dream reports. 80% of typical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances.Solms 1997. The neuropsychology of dreams. : a clinico-anatomical study. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, pp. 10, 34. ISBN 0-8058-1585-6 Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing. They estimate the duration of their dreams as longer.J.

In Antrobus, John S. & Mario Bertini (eds) The neuropsychology of sleep and dreaming. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep.Stephen LaBerge 1992. Physiological studies of lucid dreaming. in Antrobus & Bertini (eds) The neuropsychology of sleep and dreaming. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-0925-2 The mental events which occur during REM usually have dream 'hallmarks' including narrative structure, convincingness (like waking life), and instinctual themes. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a sleep disorder (more specifically a parasomnia) in which people act out their dreams. Apart from its present distribution, nothing is known about the evolution of this brain feature, and its function is not exactly known. Experiments on humans suggests they need REM sleep or they get obvious mental deterioration.Vertes, Robert P. 1986. A life-sustaining function for REM sleep: a theory.
