 "text": "African-American Jews are individuals who identify as both African American and Jewish, either through mixed heritage or conversion. This group includes those who are Jewish by birth as well as those who have converted to Judaism. A significant number of African-American Jews possess a diverse ancestry, encompassing both non-Jewish African-American and non-Black Jewish lineage. While many within this community consider themselves Jews of color, there are others who do not share this identification. Additionally, Black American Jews originating from Africa, such as the Beta Israel community from Ethiopia, may or may not choose to identify as African-American Jews.
