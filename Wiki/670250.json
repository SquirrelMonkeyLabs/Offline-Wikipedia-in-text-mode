 "text": "The arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche are several large species of bonytongue fish in the genus Arapaima. They are native to the Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. These fish are widely dispersed and do not migrate. This makes scientists think that there are more species of arapaima that scientists have not found yet. Arantes, Caroline C., Leandro Castello, Mauricio Cetra, and Ana Schilling. \"Environmental Influences on the Distribution of Arapaima in Amazon Floodplains.\" Environmental Biology of Fishes (2011): 1257-267. Print. == Species == * Arapaima agassizii (Valenciennes, 1847) (Agassiz's arapaima) * Arapaima gigas (Schinz, 1822) (pirarucu, arapaima) * Arapaima leptosoma D. J. Stewart, 2013 (slender arapaima; Solimoes arapaima) * Arapaima mapae (Valenciennes, 1847) (Mapa arapaima) == Ecology == The diet of the arapaima consists of fish, crustaceans, fruits, seeds, insects, and small land animals that walk near the shore. Arapaima can leap out of the water if they feel harassed or bullied. ==Gallery== File:Arapaima shedd.jpg|Arapaima at the Shedd Aquarium File:Arapaima gigas - Manila Ocean Park 01.jpg|Arapaima at the Manila Ocean Park File:Arapaima-full.jpg|Arapaima at the Cologne Zoological Garden File:Arapaima leptosoma 2009 G1.jpg|Arapaima leptosoma at the zoo (sea aquarium) in Sevastopol File:Stamp British Guiana 1954 72c.jpg|Arapaima depicted on a 1954 postage stamp of British Guiana ==References== Category:Living fossils Category:Teleosts",
