 "text": "The warty tree toad or Brazilian torrent frog (Hylodes asper) is a frog. It lives in Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil. It lives in streams. People have seen it as high as 1200 meters above sea level. This frog lives in fast streams. The water makes loud souds. When the male frog sings for the female frog, she cannot always hear him. So the male frog also waves his back legs in the air. It slowly lifts and lowers one foot at a time. Scientists call this \"foot-flagging.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
