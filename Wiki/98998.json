 "text": "Crypto.com Arena, originally known as Staples Center, is an indoor multi- purpose arena in downtown Los Angeles, California. It is home to two basketball teams—the Los Angeles Lakers the NBA and Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA—plus the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL in ice hockey. It was also home of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers before that team moved to the new Intuit Dome in suburban Inglewood after the 2023–24 season. They have the Grammy Awards here every year. The building hosted World Wrestling Entertainment's pay-per- view WrestleMania 21 in 2005. On December 25, 2021, the arena was renamed Crypto.com Arena, for a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange that bought the naming rights. == Home teams == *Los Angeles Kings (NHL) *Los Angeles Lakers (NBA) *Los Angeles Sparks (WNBA) == Notes == Category:Sports buildings in Los Angeles Category:WrestleMania host Category:Los Angeles Kings",
