 "text": "In linear algebra, a basis is a set of vectors in a given vector space with certain properties: * One can get any vector in the vector space by multiplying each of the basis vectors by different numbers, and then adding them up. * If any vector is removed from the basis, the property above is no longer satisfied. The plural of basis is bases. For any vector space V, any basis of V will have the same number of vectors. This number is called the dimension of V. ==Example== B=\\\\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)\\\\} is a basis of \\mathbb{R}^3 as a vector space over \\mathbb{R}. Any element of \\mathbb{R}^3 can be written as a linear combination of the above basis. Let x be any element of \\mathbb{R}^3 and let x=(x_1,x_2,x_3). Since x_1,x_2 and x_3 are elements of \\mathbb{R}, then we can write x = (x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1(1,0,0) + x_2(0,1,0) + x_3(0,0,1). So x can be written as a linear combination of the elements in B. Also, this process would not be possible for any vector x if an element was removed from B. So B is a basis for \\mathbb{R}^3. The basis B is not unique; there are infinitely many bases for \\mathbb{R}^3. Another example of a basis would be \\\\{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,1)\\\\}. Category:Linear algebra",
