 "text": "\"Himno Nacional\" (\"National Anthem\") is the national anthem of the Dominican Republic. The music was written by José Reyes (1835-1905) and the lyrics (words of the song) by Emilio Prud'homme (1856-1932). This anthem was played for the first time on 17 August 1883 in Santo Domingo. In 1897, Prud'homme made some corrections to its original poem. \"Himno Nacional\" was made the official Dominican national anthem on 30 May 1934. == Lyrics == Spanish original English translation I Brave Quisqueyans, Let’s raise our song with vivid emotion, From the world to the face of the earth Show our unconquered glorious banner. Hail, the nation who strong and intrepid, Into war launched itself set to die When in a warring challenge to the death Its chains of slavery still it cut off. No people deserves to be free If it’s an indolent slave and servile; If in its chest doesn't grow the flame that forged virile heroism. But Quisqueya the brave and indomitable Always proudly her forehead will raise For if she were a thousand times a slave This many times it will be free.''' II And if fraud and cunning exposed her To disdain of an intrusive man, Las Carreras! Beler!...were fields Which covered in glory were seen. At the top of our heroic bastion, Word of the free was materialized, Where the genius of Sanchez and Duarte Taught us to be free or to die. And if could inconsiderate leader Reduce the luster of these glories, Of the war seen in Capotillo The banner of fire waves on. And the fire that leaves shocked The arrogant lion from Castile, Removes it from glorious beaches to Where floats the banner that’s crossed. III Compatriots, let’s show erect our Forehead, proud of today for; Quisqueya will be destroyed But it will never be again enslaved. That every chest is of love a sanctuary Where one feels the homeland lives; It is the law her invincible shield; It is her motto be free or die. Liberty that still serenely lifts up Victory in her triumphal carriage. The trumpet of war still resounds Proclaiming her immortal glory Freedom! Let the echoes agitate While full of noble anxiety Our battlefields of glory reverb these words - Freedom! Freedom!
