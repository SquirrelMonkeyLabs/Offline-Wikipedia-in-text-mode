 "text": "Little Big is a Russian rave/pop punk musical group. It exists since 2013 and was created by musician and videoblogger Ilya \"Ilyich\" Prusikin and music producer Alina Pyasok. As of 2020, there are four members in the musical group: vocalists Ilya Prusikin, Sofya Tayurskaya, and Anton Lissov, and backup vocalist, DJ, and arranger Sergey Makarov. Little Big is known for its provocative and grotesque musical videos, in which the band are often making fun of national stereotypes about Russia. Almost all of videos were very successful by numbers of views on YouTube, the most known among them are ”Skibidi” and ”Faradenza” (both 2018), which as of March 2020 have been viewed 532 million times and 321 million times, respectively. They are sometimes called ‘Russia's Die Antwoord’. Together with a very few bands, such as t.A.T.u, Pussy Riot, and maybe some other lesser-known examples, Little Big are among those bands from Russia which enjoy success around the world. They should have represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in the Dutch city of Rotterdam with the song ”Uno”, but the contest was cancelled because of COVID-19. == Studio albums == * 2014: With Russia from Love * 2015: Funeral Rave * 2018: Antipositive, Pt. 1 * 2018: Antipositive, Pt. 2 == Other websites == * Official website == References == Category:2010s establishments in Russia Category:2013 establishments in Europe Category:Electronic music groups Category:Hip hop bands Category:Musical groups established in 2013 Category:Pop music groups Category:Punk bands Category:Russian musical groups",
