 "text": "Effective range is the distance a well-aimed bullet can hit a target accurately. A bullet shot can actually travel far past its effective range, but it is not certain if it will hit its target then, even if the shot was well-aimed. Generally, bullets with a higher muzzle velocity will have a longer effective range. Category:Ballistics Category:Ammunition",
