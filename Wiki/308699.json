 "text": "The Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) is a NCAA conference that plays in NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Newport News, Virginia and features universities and colleges from the Eastern and Midwestern United States. ==History== The A-10 was founded by eight Eastern schools in 1975 as the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League, and began play in 1976. It first played only men's basketball, but added other sports in 1977 and became the Eastern Athletic Association. Despite its official names, the conference was more often called the Eastern 8. By 1982, the conference had 10 schools, and it became the Atlantic 10. Although the conference has had \"10\" in its name since 1982, it has not had 10 members since Penn State left for the second and final time in 1991. Since then, the A-10 has had anywhere from 8 to 16 full members (schools that play most of their sports in the conference). From 1997 to 2006, the A-10 ran a football league; after the 2006 season, the A-10 football conference was taken over by the Colonial Athletic Association, now known as the Coastal Athletic Association. The former A-10 football conference is now known as CAA Football (in full, the Coastal Athletic Association Football Conference); it is run by the multi-sports CAA but is legally separate. ==Members== Fifteen schools are full members. Most of the members are private schools; eight are run by the Catholic Church. UMass, indicated with a pink background, will leave the A-10 for the Mid-American Conference in July 2025.
