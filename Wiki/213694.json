He is the leader of the Nation of Islam (NOI), a movement founded on a unique interpretation of Islam. ==Life== Farrakhan was born Louis Eugene Wolcott in The Bronx, New York. He started playing the violin when he was six years old. He went to the Boston Latin School. Farrakhan now lives in Kenwood, Chicago. In 1953, he married Khadijah Farrakhan. They have nine children. In 2007, he retired at the age of 64. ==Popularity== In 2020, he was classified by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as the most popular antisemite in America. Farrakhan is fairly popular among Black Americans. ===Among Black Americans=== In October 1995, he mobilized 440,000 Americans to attend the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., the tenth-largest march in American history, when he called himself \"a prophet sent by God to show America its evil\". Afterwards, he threatened to sue the National Park Service due to the low estimate from the Park Police. Just as Malcolm X, * * * * * * * * * * * * Farrakhan is an iconic figure in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, * * * * * appearing in graffitis painted by BLM activists. ===Among American feminists=== Despite Louis Farrakhan's antisemitic IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. views, he is appreciated by prominent American feminists, including but not limited to Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez and Tamika Mallory, * * * * * * the organizers of the Women's March, which took place on January 21 ‒ 22, 2017. The march has been the third-largest march in American history as of February 2025. Sarsour, Perez and Mallory are found to be admirers of Louis Farrakhan. Mallory attended one of his speeches, where he repeatedly called Jews the \"Satanic Jews\", accused Jews of \"feminizing\" Black men with marijuana, and \"gave a shoutout\" to Mallory. While acknowledging their Jewish allies' concern in November 2018, the trio were reportedly neither willing to condemn Farrakhan's antisemitism nor distance themselves from him. ===Influence=== Along with Farrakhan's former allies Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, James Baldwin * * * * * etc., Farrakhan is one of the pro-Soviet Black supremacists who mainstreamed Soviet antisemitic tropes in American society via circulation among academics and Black Americans. In American society, Soviet antisemitic tropes were normalized over the decades and engendered a form of new antisemitism, * * * * * where Jews are accused of being the \"beneficiaries\" of \"White privilege\" and \"embodiment of evil\" allegedly coordinating Western governments to \"support Israel at the expense of Palestinians\". * * * * * As per a 2016 survey by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 23% Black Americans held negative beliefs about Jews, while a 2023 survey reportedly showed that one-eighth of Black Americans doubted whether the Holocaust really happened. ==Racism== Farrakhan is well-known for his antisemitic and anti-White views, despite his and his group's denial. Many believed Farrakhan to have been involved in plotting the assassination of Malcolm X as Malcolm X reportedly abandoned his racist views about those he considered White. * * * * * ===1980s=== In June 1984, Farrakhan went to Libya to visit her dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Upon return, Farrakhan smeared Judaism as a \"gutter religion [...] structured on injustice, thievery, lying and deceit\" that \"abused\" God's name for self-defense. In 1985, at an NOI meeting, Farrakhan said that the Jews deserved the Holocaust by screaming that \"And don't you forget, when it's God who puts you in the ovens, it's forever!\" ====Connections with White supremacists==== In September 1984, former KKK member Tom Metzger donated $100 to Farrakhan's NOI after being impressed by his antisemitic rhetoric at a Los Angeles event, * * * * * a prejudice shared by both White supremacists and Black supremacists. The donation was followed by Metzger's gathering of 200 White supremacists to pledge support for Farrakhan's NOI. ===1990s=== In 1995, Farrakhan accused Jews of causing the Holocaust themselves, a false claim common among antisemites, * * * * * * * * * * * by alleging that \"German Jews financed Hitler right here in America [...] International bankers financed Hitler and poor Jews died while big Jews were at the root of what you call the Holocaust\". ===2010s=== In March 2015, Farrakhan accused \"Israelis and Zionist Jews\" of being involved in the September 11 attacks, while believing that Jews control mass media and the Hollywood to \"turn man into women and women into men\". On October 16, 2018, he implied that Jews were termites by posting on Twitter that \"I'm not an anti-Semite. I'm anti-Termite.\" On July 4, 2020, he also accused Jonathan Greenblatt, a Jewish American serving as ADL's CEO, of being \"Satan masquerading as a lawyer\", while gaslighting the public by denying that he is antisemitic: \"If you really think I hate the Jewish people, you don't know me at all [... I've never] uttered the words of death to the Jewish people.\" In addition, he has been the biggest promoter of the disproven conspiracy theory that \"Jews ran the Atlantic slave trade\", which is believed by many Islamists worldwide. ==Related pages== * Black nationalism * Islam and fascism * Black Hebrew Israelites * Secondary antisemitism * The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ==References== Category:Racism Category:1933 births Category:Antisemitism Category:Living people Category:African-American people Category:American political writers Category:American political commentators Category:American Islamic religious leaders",
