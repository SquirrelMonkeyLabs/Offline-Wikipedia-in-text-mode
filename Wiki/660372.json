 "text": "Scottish Americans are American citizens whose ancestry originated wholly or partly in Scotland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom. The majority of Scots who immigrated to the USA were originally from Northern England and Lowland Scotland before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland (Scots- Irish) and colonists. Large immigration from Scotland to the USA begin in the 1700s. The Ulster-Scots originally came from the Lowlands and the Scottish border before migrating to the province of Ulster, Ireland. From there, they would have emigrated in large numbers five generations later to North America during the eighteenth century. Today, most Americans of Scottish ancestry are concentrated in New England and the American South, with Florida, Ohio, Washington, Utah, New York and Pennsylvania also having large Scottish populations. ==Uncle Sam== Many people believe that Uncle Sam, the national personification of the United States and its people, was inspired by Samuel Wilson, a meat packer from Troy, New York, whose grandfather, Robert Wilson, was a Scottish immigrant from Greenock, Scotland to Massachusetts Bay Colony. ==Notable Scottish Americans== * George W.
