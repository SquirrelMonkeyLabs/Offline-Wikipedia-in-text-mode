They were the pre-Columbian time, the colonial period, building up the country, and as an independent country. ==Background== Humans have lived in Uruguay for over 100 000 years. When the Europeans came, the native people began dying because of the diseases brought over by the Europeans. They also fought with the Europeans a lot, so many of them died during that time. ==Social developments in the 19th century== During the 19th century, Uruguay suffered from periods of dictatorship and civil war. Despite this, a number of positive social advances nevertheless took place. A law was introduced in 1829 relating (as noted by one study) “to invalidity, widowhood and orphanages for people for fought for independence.” In 1830, it was made a constitutional requirement for the executive branch to provide retirement pensions for military personnel and civil servants.Social Welfare in Latin America Edited by John Dixon and Robert Scheurell, Routledge London and New York, 1990, P.250 A law of 1838 required “the deduction of one day’s pay per month from the salaries of public employees in order that civil pensions and retirement allowances might be serviced.”Uruguay: Portrait of a Democracy By Russell Humke Fitzgibbon, 1956 P.175 In 1896, a teachers’ pension and retirement fund was set up.Uruguay: Portrait of a Democracy By Russell Humke Fitzgibbon, 1956 P.180 A number of public health measures were implemented,Origenes, Organización actual y Servicios Sanitarios del Consejo Nacio&l; de Higiene del Uruguay Por el DR. JULIO ETCHEPARE Inspector de Sanidad Terrestre with an early action involving the establishment of a large market in Montevideo “to improve the highly unsanitary conditions under which meat and other foods had been sold.” In 1853, the Old City took steps to extend its rudimentary sewer system, and Montevideo became the first Latin American city to have a complete sewerage system. Action to provide running water started in 1866. In 1847 the legislature passed an ordinance providing for vaccination against smallpox, while vaccination (which began for schoolchildren as early as 1829) became compulsory for infants in 1850. The 1850s also saw “the first systematic and extensive steps taken to provide quarantine and disinfection services.” In 1883 a “House of Disinfection” was established in Montevideo and 4 years later a lazaret which was considered a model of its kind was established on the Isla de Flores.[Uruguay: Portrait of a Democracy By Russell Humke Fitzgibbon, 1956 P.172 In 1871 and 1878 regulations were issued to “govern the construction of conventillos in terms of aeration and sanitation.Historias de la vida privada en el Uruguay: El nacimiento de la intimidad, 1870-1920 Volume 2 1996, P.94 In the early 1830s Uruguay’s first real hospital, the Charity Hospital, was established at Montevideo. In education, Uruguay’s first school law was passed in 1826, while the first budget for public instruction “involved the munificent sum of 10,800 pesos.”Uruguay: Portrait of a Democracy By Russell Humke Fitzgibbon, 1956 P.199 A project for a national university was approved in 1833, and organizations were formed in 1847 and 1848 to develop and control primary and secondary education. In 1849, the University of Montevideo (officially the University of the Republic) was established on July 18, 1849.Uruguay: Portrait of a Democracy By Russell Humke Fitzgibbon, 1956 P.200 In 1878 the first law to set up a free public education system was approved.A Century of Social Welfare in Uruguay Growth to the Limit of the Batllista Social State Issue 5 By Fernando Filgueira, 1995, P.4 In 1880 the Executive Branch was authorized to form colonies or help colonization companies, establishing the right of expropriation for reasons of public utility is established. In 1882 public lands occupied by tenants could be used for the formation of agricultural colonies.Antecedentes Línea de tiempo 100 años del Reglamento de Tierras A decree of November 28, 1882 provided that public lands, occupied by tenants, may be used for the formation of agricultural colonies.Instituto Nacional de Colonización. Ley No. 11.029 de 12 de enero de 1948 Informe y proyecto de ley de la Comisión Especial de Reforma Agraria del Senado y discusión parlamentaria en dicho cuerpo 1948, P.64 In spite of these developments, Uruguay suffered from numerous social and economic inequalities. As noted by one study, “The government had not as yet turned its attention to the relations of labour and capital: there was no regulation of the labour of women and children, no provision for accidents, no official means of protest for employees against unfair treatment, no restrictions on the hours of work.”Utopia in Uruguay: Chapters in the Economic History of Uruguay by Simon Gabriel Hanson, Oxford University Press, 1938, P.16 Rural workers experienced low wages and poor living conditions and were wholly dependent on the will of the landowner, and while slavery had been abolished in the forties “the rural worker was still without defences against the landowner and was a willing instrument in the hands of political leaders.”Utopia in Uruguay: Chapters in the Economic History of Uruguay by Simon Gabriel Hanson, Oxford University Press, 1938, P.8-9 Also, during the late Nineteenth Century a period of capitalist modernization took place which caused a great deal of hardship. According to one study, “The capitalist country model implemented by militarism during the governments of Latorre and Santos (fascicle 4) with the approval of the dominant classes that had promoted it (ranchers, large-scale commerce, finance), soon demonstrated its frailties and shortcomings: mainly, its dependence on the great centers of world capitalism, causing the deformations of our economy; as well as the acute social contradictions, which caused unemployment and misery of the rural masses.”Bases n° 5: El reformismo y sus límites (1903-1933), P.3 As noted by another study, wire fences cut down the need for hands, with excess hands asked or forced to leave. They were dragooned into the army or drifted in rural slums known as pueblos de ratas (rat towns).José Battle Y Ordoñez of Uruguay: the Creator of His Times, 1902-1907 by Milton I. Vanger, 1963, P.5 Measures to mitigate the problems of Uruguayan society would be undertaken during the age of José Battle Y Ordoñez. ==The age of José Battle Y Ordoñez== Several progressive reforms were undertaken by José Battle Y Ordoñez, who would serve as president of Uruguay from 1903 to 1907 and again from 1911 to 1915. Many of his successors would continue his policies. The Batlle era saw the introduction of numerous reforms. In 1910 a hospital for children and an asylum were constructed, while building started on a hospital for tuberculosis patients. In 1915, a Maternity House, asylums for older children, a milk program for children up the age of two, and a service in medical emergencies in homes were initiated. Hospital services \"also began to improve in the capital cities of the interior\" while small asylums were set up for abandoned mothers and their children in some rural towns. In 1920 a second public hospital was established in Montevideo was established to provide general services, while another facility provided exclusive care for the elderly and beggars.A Century of Social Welfare in Uruguay Growth to the Limit of the Batllista Social State Issue 5 By Fernando Filgueira, 1995, P.5 Research institutes were also founded, while a children's hospital, an orphanage, a senior citizen's home and military hospital were also built.Social Security in Latin America Pressure Groups, Stratification, and Inequality By Carmelo Mesa-Lago, 1978, 3 The Case of Uruguay Prepared by Arturo C.

This aimed to protect the “right to life.”HISTORIA DE LA INDUSTRIA EN EL URUGUAY 1730 1980 by Dr. MARIO DANIEL LAMAS and Prof. DIOSMA E. PIOTTI DE LAMAS, P.156 In 1927 the minimum wage for public functionaries was introduced.A Century of Social Welfare in Uruguay Growth to the Limit of the Batllista Social State Issue 5 By Fernando Filgueira, 1995, P.10 Various reforms in education were also carried out. Public secondary education was instituted while university education was reformed, \"creating new schools for professionals.\" In 1912 secondary schools were set up in each of the 18 departmental capitals of the interior \"and incorporated into the Secondary Education Section of the University that operated in Montevideo (Universidad de la Republica). A secondary night school was established in 1919 \"so that adults who had not finished secondary school could continue their formal education.\"A Century of Social Welfare in Uruguay Growth to the Limit of the Batllista Social State Issue 5 By Fernando Filgueira, 1995, P.6 The National Commission for Charity and Public Welfare was authorized to create a \"Gota de Leche\" clinic.El Dr. Claudio Williman, su vida pública By José Claudio Williman, 1957, P.482 A period of land reform lastly roughly between 1913 and 1923, with 2 laws passed that established 10 agricultural \"colonies\" totalling \"about 75,000 acres, divided into farms averaging about 100 acres in size.\"Uruguay: Portrait of a Democracy By Russell Humke Fitzgibbon, 1956 P.119 Through support provided by the superior Government, Public Assistance was able to open the first Gota de Leche Clinic in the city of Montevideo at the start of 1908.Proceedings of the Second Pan American Scientific Congress Volume 9 1917 P.242 The reforms of the Batlle era served as a rallying cry for supporters of Batlle's ideas. An attendee at a Colorado Party convention in 1916 noted the social progress Uruguay had made while also identifying the party with ordinary citizens: \"-Let us stop without regret and without discouragement. For the same reason that this is a truce, let us prepare all our forces to resume new campaigns tomorrow, in happier days, when the environment is more propitious, when all the hostilities, when all the slander, when all the aggressions, when all the anaconisms and all personalisms have dissipated, before the evidence that will come, bright as the sun, that we have always proceeded well, that we have always sincerely taken into account, above all things, the interest of the Republic, the interest of its greatness, the interest in the improvement of its institutions, for the benefit of all, the rich and the poor, the humble and the powerful; but yes, let's confess it: especially the poor and the humble... (Very good! - Applause) -because always, gentlemen, they were the abandoned ones! And the party that has popular core, that nourishes its blood with the blood of the people, could not leave them like this in the hours of triumph, in the hours in which it believed, unselfish and sentimentalist, that the environment was conducive to everything good for of the poor and the humble. And we brought upon our heads all the conspiracies of the irreducible reactionaries. –(Big applause) -But this very thing, gentlemen, reveals and demonstrates the moral nature of our party that, at the risk of attracting the opposition of the most powerful classes, realized many popular hopes and dignified many institutions, exalted the concept of its duties, promoting that, as well as The country in the past, with spear boats, with epic thrust, founded democracy on the social equality of the rights of the people. –(Big applause) La convención nacional colorada Domingo 13 de agosto de 1916, El DIA In the lead up to the November 1919 general elections, the Agrupación Colorada Batllista started publishing its program of works carried out from 1903 to 1918.
