 "text": "The 2021–22 UEFA Champions League was the 67th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA. Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 1–0 in the final, which was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, for a record-extending 14th title, and their fifth in nine years. It was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were moved back a year, with Saint Petersburg scheduled to host the 2022 final. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the final was eventually moved to Saint-Denis. As the winners, Real Madrid automatically qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League group stage, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup. Additionally, the winners typically qualify for the annual FIFA Club World Cup. However, the tournament's status remains uncertain, following FIFA's proposal for a format improvement. Chelsea were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid. This season was the first since 1999–2000 (the first season after the end of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup) where three major European club competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the newly created UEFA Europa Conference League) are organised by UEFA. No changes were made to the format of the Champions League, but teams that were eliminated from the preliminary round and first qualifying round of the Champions League were now transferred to the Europa Conference League instead of the Europa League. On 24 June 2021, UEFA approved the proposal to remove the away goals rule in all UEFA club competitions, which had been used since 1965. If in a two-legged tie two teams scored the same number of aggregate goals, the winner of the tie would not be decided by the number of away goals scored by each team but always by 30 minutes of extra time, and if the two teams scored the same amount of goals in extra time, the winner would be decided by a penalty shoot-out. ==Association team allocation== A total of 80 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1–4 each had four teams qualify. *Associations 5–6 each had three teams qualify. *Associations 7–15 each had two teams qualify. *Associations 16–55 (except Liechtenstein) each had one team qualify. *The winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League and 2020–21 UEFA Europa League were each given an additional entry if they did not qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League through their own domestic league. (As Chelsea, the Champions League title holders, did qualify through their own domestic league this season, the additional entry for the Champions League title holders was re-allocated.) ===Association ranking=== For the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2020 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2015–16 to 2019–20. Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below: * – Additional berth for UEFA Europa League title holders Association ranking for 2021–22 UEFA Champions League {| class=\"wikitable\" Rank Association Coeff.

As the Champions League title holders, Chelsea, which were guaranteed a berth in the Champions League group stage, already qualified via their domestic league (as fourth place in the 2020-21 Premier League), the following changes to the access list were made: *The champions of association 11 (Turkey) entered the group stage instead of the play-off round. *The champions of association 13 (Denmark) entered the play-off round instead of the third qualifying round. *The champions of association 15 (Czech Republic) entered the third qualifying round instead of the second qualifying round. *The champions of associations 18 (Greece) and 19 (Serbia) entered the second qualifying round instead of the first qualifying round.

The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles: *Pot 1 contained the Champions League and Europa League title holders, and the champions of the top six associations based on their 2020 UEFA country coefficients. *Pot 2, 3 and 4 contained the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2021 UEFA club coefficients. Teams from the same association, and due to political reasons, teams from Ukraine and Russia, could not be drawn into the same group. Before the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A–D and another team was drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would play on different days. The matches were played on 14–15 September, 28–29 September, 19–20 October, 2–3 November, 23–24 November, and 7–9 December 2021. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth- placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season. Sheriff Tiraspol made their debut appearance in the group stage. They were the first team from Moldova to play in the Champions League group stage. ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Group E=== ===Group F=== ===Group G=== ===Group H=== ==Knockout phase== In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. ===Bracket=== ===Round of 16=== ===Quarter-finals=== ===Semi-finals=== ===Final=== ==Statistics== Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round. ===Top goalscorers=== Rank Player Team Goals Minutes played 1 Karim Benzema Real Madrid 15 1106 2 Robert Lewandowski Bayern Munich 13 876 3 Sébastien Haller Ajax 11 668 4 Mohamed Salah Liverpool 8 1008 5 Christopher Nkunku RB Leipzig 7 531 Riyad Mahrez Manchester City 986 7 Cristiano Ronaldo Manchester United 6 611 Darwin Núñez Benfica 613 Kylian Mbappé Paris Saint-Germain 673 Leroy Sané Bayern Munich 798 Arnaut Danjuma Villarreal 906 ===Top assists=== Rank Player Team Assists Minutes played 1 Bruno Fernandes Manchester United 7 520 2 Leroy Sané Bayern Munich 6 798 Vinícius Júnior Real Madrid 1199 4 Antony Ajax 5 577 5 João Mário Benfica 4 493 Gerard Moreno Villarreal 524 Kylian Mbappé Paris Saint-Germain 673 Kevin De Bruyne Manchester City 734 Trent Alexander-Arnold Liverpool 794 Étienne Capoue Villarreal 1046 Luka Modrić Real Madrid 1077 ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== *",
