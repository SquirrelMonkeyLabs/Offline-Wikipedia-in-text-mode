The event airs as a special episode of AEW's flagship television show, Dynamite. The name \"Blood & Guts\" comes from WWE's chairman at that time, Vince McMahon. During a conference call with investors, McMahon said that WWE was going to remain a \"PG environment\" and that \"we're not going to do blood and guts and things of that nature such as being done on perhaps a new potential competitor\".
