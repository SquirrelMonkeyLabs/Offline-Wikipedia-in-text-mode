 "text": "Mucuchíes' frog (Aromobates zippeli) is a frog. It lives in Mérida, Venezuela. ==Body== One adult male frog was 25 mm long from nose to rear end. These frogs have short back legs. The skin of the frog's back is olive green, brown, or black. There are two light yellow, brown, or green stripes on the sides of the body. The sides of the body are black or dark brown with white spots. Any part of the top of the frog's body can have spots on it, and the spots can be blue. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams in dry forests on mountains. Scientists found the frog near a town called Mucuchíe. Scientists saw the frog between 2270 and 3240 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. The male frog carries the tadpoles to water after the eggs hatch. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to make farms. These farms also put bad chemicals into the water. Diseases can also hurt this frog. Scientists caught some frogs and found that they had many nematode worms in their bodies. Scientists do not know if the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis], which causes chytridiomycosis, can kill this frog. Scientists took thirty frogs out of the wild and took them to the Rescue of Endangered Venezuelan Amphibians Center (REVA). They plan to put these frogs' young back in the wild when they can. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
