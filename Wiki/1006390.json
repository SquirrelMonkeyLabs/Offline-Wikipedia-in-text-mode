 "text": "Owston's green tree frog or Japanese flying frog (Zhangixalus owstoni) is a frog. It lives in Japan. The adult male frog is about 42-51 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 50-67 mm long. There is not much webbing on the feet. This frog mostly lives in forests, where it stays in trees. But when it is time to lay eggs, the frogs go to grasslands and wet places. People have seen this frog between 20 and 450 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Its home includes one protected park: Iriomote Ishigaki National Park on Iriomote Island. On other islands, its home keeps changing because people build farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
