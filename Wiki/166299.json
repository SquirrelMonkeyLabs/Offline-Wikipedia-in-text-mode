 "text": "A military organization is a way of making up the armed forces of a state so as to offer military capability as needed by a national defence policy. Armed forces are led by officers, who command military units such as squads, platoons, companies, battalions, brigades and so forth. In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nation's armed forces. Armed forces that are not a part of the military or paramilitary organizations, such as insurgent forces, often mimic military organizations, or use ad hoc structures.",
