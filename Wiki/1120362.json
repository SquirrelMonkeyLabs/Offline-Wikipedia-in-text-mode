 "text": "Snakeheads are Chinese gangs that smuggle people to other countries. They come from the Fujian region of China and organise the illegal migration of their customers into wealthier Western countries, including Western Europe, North America, Australia, and nearby regions like Taiwan and Japan. # Operations: Snakeheads employ various methods to move people across borders. These methods include using stolen or altered passports, improperly obtained visas, and bribes to facilitate the journey until the final destination is reached. They may also create fake business delegations or tour groups to evade immigration controls. # Payment: The rate for successful smuggling can be as high as US$70,0001. This business attracts criminal networks. # Notable Members: One snakehead member was Cheng Chui Ping, also known as “Sister Ping.” Another figure is Guo Liang Chi, who orchestrated the Golden Venture cargo ship tragedy in 1993, which was financed by Sister Ping. ==References== Category:Gangs Category:Immigration Category:Chinese criminals",
