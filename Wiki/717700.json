 "text": "The Senate of the Republic () or Senate () is a house of the bicameral Italian Parliament (the other being the Chamber of Deputies). The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately. It was created in its current form on 8 May 1948, but existed during the Kingdom of Italy as (Senate of the Kingdom), itself a continuation of the (Subalpine Senate) of Sardinia created on 8 May 1848. Members of the Senate are styled Senator or The Honourable Senator () and they meet at Palazzo Madama, Rome. ==References== Category:Government of Italy",
