They can still be seen on some train stations. In Paris the old kiosks which sold newspapers, cigarettes and tickets are being replaced. The replacements are said to be more functional but less charming.Les anciens kiosques parisiens seront bien remplac√©s In oriental countries like Persia or Turkey, a kiosk is larger and grander than in other countries.
