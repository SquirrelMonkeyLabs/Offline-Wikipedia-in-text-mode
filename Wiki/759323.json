 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Rwanda in March 2020. The first case of COVID-19 in Rwanda was confirmed on 14 March 2020. Four other people were tested after the first case tested positive, bringing the number of cases to five. On 21 March, officials announced a two-week lockdown. Both public and private employees are to work from home, under strict measures. All borders are also to be closed, cargo and Rwandan nationals being exempt, with a mandatory 14-day quarantine. On 9 April, three new cases of coronavirus were identified, out of 720 samples examined in the previous 24 hours. This brought the total number of confirmed cases to 113 people (of which seven had recovered). The Rwandan government was very strict about the pandemic. They had a curfew and made people sit and listen to speeches all night if they were outside during curfew. The police arrested a lot of people, including people who said they were abusing their power during the pandemic. ==References== Category:History of Rwanda Rwanda",
