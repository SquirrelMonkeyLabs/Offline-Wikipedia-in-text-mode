The word can mean: ==Generic== * A place or person who is proud of its multicultural heritage ==Media== * Cosmopolitan, an American women's magazine ==Politics== * World citizens think that all the people of the world should follow the same ideals or international law, especially on human rights and that the idea of nation- states will be therefore outdated, before international organizations * An antisemitic trope accusing Jews of being disloyal to their home country, popularized by the Soviet Union ==Science== * A living thing has a cosmopolitan distribution if it lives on all parts of Earth",
