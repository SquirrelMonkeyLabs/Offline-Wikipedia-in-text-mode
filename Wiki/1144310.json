He was freed by the Soviets to live in Nazi-occupied Poland after the Nazi-Soviet partition of Poland in October 1939. * Mirchuk, P.

He tried to create a Ukrainian government in Nazi- occupied Soviet Ukraine, but was deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Upon his release in September 1944, he negotiated the founding of the Ukrainian National Army (UNA) and Ukrainian National Committee (UNK) before the fall of Nazi Germany, but it had no impact on the post-war fate of the Ukrainians.Kondratyuk, Kostyantin.

(in Ukrainian) Ukraine did not restore independence until 1991. ==Postwar== Bandera and his family were resettled in Munich, West Germany. The Soviet Union asked for Bandera and several Ukrainian nationalists to be handed over under the intra-Allied cooperation wartime agreement. However, the Americans refused to hand over him. They saw him as too valuable to give up due to his knowledge of the Soviet Union useful for the Cold War. In his final years, he also visited Ukrainian exile communities in the UK, Austria, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Spain and Canada. ==Death== Due to Bandera's commitment to Ukrainian liberation from Soviet imperialism, the Soviets had made several attempts on his life, which they ultimately succeeded on October 15, 1959, when Bandera died of cyanide gas poisoning on a street in Munich. ==Views== ===Poles=== During Bandera's detention in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, the OUN-B was involved in the massacre of Poles in Volhynia and eastern Galicia, which killed as many as 133,000 Poles, * * Grzegorz Motyka, Od rzezi wołyńskiej do akcji \"Wisła, Kraków 2011, , s.447, Ewa Siemaszko estimates victims to be 133,000 in Stan badań nad ludobójstwem dokonanym na ludności polskiej przez Organizację Ukraińskich Nacjonalistów i Ukraińską Powstańczą Armię, Bogusław Paź (ed.), Ludobójstwo na Kresach południowo-wschodniej Polski w latach 1939–1946, Wrocław 2011, , s.341. * but his role is disputed. Such matter continues to be Poland–Ukraine relations' Achilles heel, preventing Ukraine from joining the European Union (EU) and receiving military protection. * * * ===Jews=== Both Rossolinski-Liebe and German political scientist Andreas Umland believed that Bandera was not involved in the Holocaust, Rossoliński- Liebe saw Bandera's antisemitic views as a product of his time. The view was shared by American historian Alexander John Motyl, who did not see Ukrainian nationalism as antisemitic as Nazism. Rather, the OUN-B saw the Poles and Russians as its main enemies. ==Legacy== Since Bandera's death in 1959, he has been a highly divisive figure in both Europe and America, with his legacy under intense debate, complicated by geopolitics, including the EU–Ukraine relations, Polish WWII history dispute * * * and Ukraino–Russian war, * * * when Putin's dictatorship keeps equating Bandera with ordinary Ukrainians to demonize Ukraine and justify the invasion. * * * ==Legacy== ===Ukrainians=== Since Ukraine restored independence in 1991, Stepan Bandera monuments have been built across western Ukraine, including the Stepan Bandera monument in Lviv. * * In December 2018, the Ukrainian Parliament declared January 1 as the national day of commemoration for Stepan Bandera. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine started, Stepan Bandera has reportedly been rehabilitated in Ukraine as a national hero who sacrificed for the fight against Russian imperialism, with substantial popularity among young Ukrainians. * * * In April 2022, it is found that 74% Ukrainians had a favourable view of Stepan Bandera. On New Year's Day 2023, the Ukrainian Parliament tweeted a photo of Valeri Zaloujny, the then-Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, giving a thumbs-up to a Stepan Bandera portrait, with a caption encouraging Ukrainians to keep up the fight. ===Others=== American historian Timothy D. Snyder remarked, Meanwhile, German-Polish historian Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe said, However, Czech political scientist Luboš Veselý criticized Rossoliński-Liebe's book on Stepan Bandera as a slander of Bandera and Ukrainian nationalism, ==Related pages== * Double genocide theory * Soviet persecution of Poles during World War II ==References== Category:Ukraine Category:1909 births Category:World War II Category:1959 deaths Category:20th century Category:1930s in Europe Category:1940s in Europe Category:History of Poland Category:History of Ukraine Category:20th century in Europe",
