 "text": "The International Bear Brotherhood Flag is a flag representing the international bear community. The design was probably inspired by the Gay Rainbow Flag and the Leather Pride Flag. The colors represent all the \"fur colors and nationalities around the world.\" The flag was trademarked in 1995. It has been heavily marketed. It appears on tee shirts, baseball caps, license plates, and other items.Ray Kampf. (2000). The Bear Handbook. Psychology Press. p. 16.Ron Suresha. (2009). Bears on Bears: Interviews and Discussion. Lethe Press. p. 252. Two bear flags preceded the International Bear Brotherhood Flag. A flag created by the Front Range Bears was introduced in 1992. It appeared in pride parades in Denver, San Francisco, and the 1993 March on Washington, DC. Colors used for the five diagonally placed stripes were gold, grey, brown, white, and black. Another bear flag was produced in Seattle. It is not seen outside the Northwest. It too uses diagonal stripes. == References == Category:Bear (gay male) Category:LGBT flags",
