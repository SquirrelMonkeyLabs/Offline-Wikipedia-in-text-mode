On November 13, 2021, a second season was announced, which premiered on July 30, 2022. == Premise == The story follows I.M.P. (Immediate Murder Professionals), a murder company in Hell. The members are Blitzo (pronounced \"Blitz\"), the owner of the company, Millie and Moxxie, a married imp couple, and Loona, a hellhound who is Blitzo's daughter. Blitzo also has a tricky relationship with Stolas, a demon prince. Stolas has a book called a grimoire, which I.M.P. uses to do their job, because it allows them to access the human world. The series takes place in the same universe as Hazbin Hotel, but with different characters and stories.
