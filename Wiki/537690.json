 "text": "The West African CFA franc is the currency of eight countries in West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Sénégal and Togo. CFA means Communauté Financière d'Afrique (\"Financial Community of Africa\") or Communauté Financière Africaine (\"African Financial Community\"). The Central African CFA franc has the same value as the West African CFA franc. The pegging of the CFA franc to the euro is considered by some as a guarantee of stability, while others equate it with voluntary servitude. == References == Category:Currency of Africa",
