 "text": "Brett Lorenzo Favre (born October 10, 1969, in Kiln, Mississippi, United States) is a former American football quarterback in the National Football League. He played college football for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles. Favre was known for his controversy as well, especially his retirement saga and sexual abuse scandal with New York and failure to cooperate in the investigation, for which he was fined $50 thousand. Favre is also well known for his love of the outdoors and his \"iron man\" reputation earned for his toughness, which helped him in cold Wisconsin and Minnesota. He was a color anylst for one 2011 college game. ==Childhood== Brett weighed 9 pounds 15 ounces when he was born on Oct. 10, 1969. He had several brothers with whom he played baseball and football. ==College== Favre started at the quarterback position for The University of Southern Mississippi for four solid years. ==Professional career== ===Atlanta Falcons=== Favre was chosen in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. He threw two interceptions. ===Green Bay Packers=== On February 10, 1992, after a season with the Falcons, he was traded to the Green Bay Packers on for the 19th pick in the 1992 NFL Draft. He became the Packers' starting quarterback in 1992, then started every game after the 1992 season until the end of the 2007 season with the Packers. He was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXI, which was especially notable because Favre was previously addicted to pain killers that he took. On November 4, 2007, Favre became the third to beat the other 31 teams after beating the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. The 2008 NFC Championship game against the New York Giants would be Brett Favre's last game as a Packer in which the Pack lost in overtime when Favre threw an interception. The interception is Favre's last pass as a Packer. Despite many interceptions, Favre had a great career with Green Bay. In 2008 he said that he would retire, but later changed his mind before the 2008 season start. The Packers stuck with the decision to start a younger player, Aaron Rodgers, as their quarterback. ===New York Jets=== Favre was dealt to the New York Jets. He and the Jets started off the season well, but Favre got hurt down the stretch. That injury was not reported by the Jets, who had to pay a $125,000 fine. Favre ended the season with 22 touchdown passes and 22 interceptions. ===Minnesota Vikings=== He retired again after the season, but came out of retirement another time to play for the Minnesota Vikings for the 2009 season. Favre actually had the best statistical season of his career in 2009, throwing for 34 touchdowns next to seven interceptions for Minnesota. However, his season ended with an interception by Tracy Porter in a loss to the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship. After this, he decided to play for the Vikings in 2010 as well, but threw only 11 touchdowns next to 19 interceptions as he and the franchise struggled. Favre was often injured, and retired for good after the season ended. ===Records=== Favre started 297 games in a row at quarterback from 1992 to 2010. He became the first quarterback to lead his team to victory over all of the NFL's 32 teams after defeating the Chiefs on November 4, 2007. Seven years later, Peyton Manning would accomplish this feet after defeating the Indianapolis Colts (his former team), in their opener. In 2007 against the Vikings, he also threw his 421st career touchdown pass, setting another record. ===NFL Statistics=== Regular Season Passing Rushing YEAR TEAM GP GS CMP ATT CMP% YDS TD INT LNG 20+ 40+ SK SKY YPA YPG TD% INT% RATE W L ATT YDS AVG TD LNG 1ST 1991 ATL 2 0 0 4 0.0 0 0 2 — 0 0 1 11 0.0 0.0 0.0 50.0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 1992 GB 15 13 302 471 64.1 3,227 18 13 76T 30 9 34 208 6.9 215.1 3.8 2.8 85.3 8 5 47 198 4.2 1 19 11 1993 GB 16 16 318 522 60.9 3,303 19 24 66T 37 5 30 199 6.3 206.4 3.6 4.6 72.2 9 7 58 216 3.7 1 27 13 1994 GB 16 16 363 582 62.4 3,882 33 14 49 44 4 31 188 6.7 242.6 5.7 2.4 90.7 9 7 42 202 4.8 2 36T 14 1995 GB 16 16 359 570 63.0 4,413 38 13 99T 59 5 33 217 7.7 275.8 6.7 2.3 99.5 11 5 39 181 4.6 3 40 17 1996 GB 16 16 325 543 59.9 3,899 39 13 80T 49 11 40 241 7.2 243.7 7.2 2.4 95.8 13 3 49 136 2.8 2 23 18 1997 GB 16 16 304 513 59.3 3,867 35 16 74 61 9 25 176 7.5 241.7 6.8 3.1 92.6 13 3 58 187 3.2 1 16 16 1998 GB 16 16 347 551 63.0 4,212 31 23 84T 47 9 38 223 7.6 263.2 5.6 4.2 87.8 11 5 40 133 3.3 1 35 13 1999 GB 16 16 341 595 57.3 4,091 22 23 74T 52 11 35 223 6.9 255.7 3.7 3.9 74.7 8 8 28 142 5.1 0 20 11 2000 GB 16 16 338 580 58.3 3,812 20 16 67T 41 7 33 236 6.6 238.2 3.4 2.8 78.0 9 7 27 108 4.0 0 18 7 2001 GB 16 16 314 510 61.6 3,921 32 15 67T 53 13 22 151 7.7 245.1 6.3 2.9 94.1 12 4 38 56 1.5 1 14 5 2002 GB 16 16 341 551 61.9 3,658 27 16 85T 39 7 26 188 6.6 228.6 4.9 2.9 85.6 12 4 25 73 2.9 0 17 6 2003 GB 16 16 308 471 65.4 3,361 32 21 66T 42 7 19 137 7.1 210.1 6.8 4.5 90.4 10 6 18 15 0.8 0 7 3 2004 GB 16 16 346 540 64.1 4,088 30 17 79T 50 12 12 93 7.6 255.5 5.6 3.1 92.4 10 6 16 36 2.3 0 17 2 2005 GB 16 16 372 607 61.3 3,881 20 29 59 40 7 24 170 6.4 242.6 3.3 4.8 70.9 4 12 18 62 3.4 0 20 4 2006 GB 16 16 343 613 56.0 3,885 18 18 82T 49 8 21 134 6.3 242.8 2.9 2.9 72.7 8 8 23 29 1.3 1 14 4 2007 GB 16 16 356 535 66.5 4,155 28 15 82T 49 16 15 93 7.8 259.7 5.2 2.8 95.7 13 3 29 12 0.4 0 21 3 2008 NYJ 16 16 343 522 65.7 3,472 22 22 56T 40 7 30 213 6.7 217.0 4.2 4.2 81.0 9 7 21 43 2.0 1 27 4 2009 MIN 16 16 363 531 68.4 4,202 33 7 63 48 11 34 247 7.9 259.1 5.8 1.4 107.2 12 4 9 7 0.8 0 4 1 2010 MIN 13 13 217 358 60.6 2,509 11 19 53T 38 1 22 139 7.0 193.0 3.1 5.3 69.9 5 8 17 8 0.5 0 10 1 20 Seasons 302 298 6,300 10,169 62.0 71,838 508 336 99 872 161 525 3,487 7.1 237.9 5.0 3.3 86.0 186 112 602 1,844 3.1 14 40 153 ==Favre away from football== ===Personal=== Despite contoversy, Favre also has an interesting personal life.
