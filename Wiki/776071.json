 "text": "In Arabic and Maltese, consonants are divided into two groups: the sun/solar letters ( , Maltese: konsonanti xemxin) and moon/lunar letters ( , Maltese: konsonanti qamrin). In those languages, all nouns start with the word \"al\" (الـ) in Arabic or \"il\" in Maltese. Both words mean \"the.\" If a sun letter comes after the consonant, the \"l\" sound in \"al\" or \"il\" is dropped and is replaced by whatever sound the letter makes. However, if a moon letter comes after, the \"l\" sound in those words stays. In Arabic, the word for \"the sun\" is ash-shams because the \"sh\" sound is a sun letter. Meanwhile, the word for \"the moon\" is al-qamar because the \"q\" sound is a moon letter. == Rule == Below is a chart of the sun and moon letters in Arabic.

In the case of sun letters, a mark called the shaddah (ـّـ) is written over the sun letter. For moon letters, a mark called the sukun (ـْـ)is written over the letter ل lam in the al-.

Sun letters ċ d n r s t x ż z Moon letters b f ġ g għ h ħ j k l m p q v w If a word starts with any of the moon letters, the word il- stays the same. However, if it stats with a sun letter, the word il- changes to iċ-, id-, in-, ir-, is-, it-, ix-, iż-, iz-. If a word begins with two consonants, it changes to \"l-i-.\" For example, skola (school) becomes l-iskola (the school). == References == Category:Arabic language Category:Alphabets",
