 "text": "The Cucuteni-Trypillia culture was an ancient society that existed in Eastern Europe between 5500 to 2750 BCE. It covered a large area from modern-day Moldova to western Ukraine and northeastern Romania. The culture is known for building large settlements with up to 3,000 structures, and potentially being inhabited by up to 46,000 people. They had a unique tradition of periodically burning their settlements, and then rebuilding them on top of the old ones. Some settlements had up to 13 levels of habitation. == References == Category:Neolithic",
