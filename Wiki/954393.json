 "text": "The Alhandra heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes brevirostris) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 100 meters above sea level. ==Home== This frog lives in forests and shrublands. This frog sits on bromeliad plants. Scientists think the female frog lays her eggs in water on the leaves of the plants. They think that the tadpoles swim in this water. The scientists are not sure because they have not seen the frog do so yet. ==Danger== This frog is in a little danger of dying out, but scientists say that human beings change the places where it lives to build towns, build farms, get wood to build with, and make places for animals to eat grass. Human beings also take the bromeliad plants that the frog lives on. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
