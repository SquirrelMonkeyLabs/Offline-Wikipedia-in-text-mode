 "text": "Cartoon Network is an American television channel. It broadcasts television programs that are suitable for young children. Most of the shows are animated cartoon series, but some live-action shows are also broadcast. However, at night Cartoon Network switches to Adult Swim which broadcasts programs for teens and adults instead. Cartoon Network first launched in October 1, 1992 through cable and satellite television in the United States by Turner Broadcasting System (or TBS for short). In the early years, many of the shows featured on the channel were classic cartoons and Hanna-Barbera shows. TBS later launched Cartoon Network Studios to make flagship original shows specifically for Cartoon Network. After successfully launching the channel in the United States, TBS decided to launch the channel in other countries. The Cartoon Network channels in other countries distributes Cartoon Network's original shows in different languages. ==Programming== ===Current programming=== *ACME Night **America's Funniest Home Videos **Archer **Miss Farah **Chicago Fire **Chicago Med **Chicago P.D. **Fargo **Hazbin Hotel **Helluva Boss **The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon *Curb Your Enthusiasm *Grey's Anatomy *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit *N.C.I.S. *NCIS: Los Angeles *Peacemaker *Riverdale *The Rookie *The Walking Dead ===Former programming=== *2 Broke Girls *24 *30 Rock *According to Jim *Alias *Ally McBeal *American Dad! *Animation Domination *Awake *Baby Daddy *Babylon 5 *Beavis and Butt-Head *The Bernie Mac Show *Beverly Hills, 90210 *Better Call Saul *The Big Bang Theory *The Big C *Bob's Burgers *Body of Proof *BoJack Horseman *Breaking Bad *Californication *The Carrie Diaries *Celebrity Deathmatch *Chicago Hope *Chicago Justice *Chuck *The Cleveland Show *Close Enough *Community *Cougar Town *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation *CSI: Cyber *CSI: NY *The Crazy Ones *Dallas *Desperate Housewives *Dexter *Entourage *Episodes *Family Matters *Family Guy *The Finder *Freaks and Geeks *Full House *Fuller House *Futurama *Gary Unmarried *George Lopez *Gilmore Girls *Glee *Girls *The Good Place *The Good Wife *Gossip Girl *Gotham *Hawaii Five-O *Hawaii Five-0 *Hercules: The Legendary Journeys *Heroes *Home and Away *Hope & Faith *Hot in Cleveland *House of Cards *How I Met Your Mother *Hung *I Hate My Teenage Daughter *JAG *Jane the Virgin *The Jerry Springer Show *Judge Judy *Justified *King of the Hill *The King of Queens *Kyle XY *Las Vegas *Law & Order *Law & Order: Criminal Intent *Law & Order: LA *Law & Order: Trial by Jury *Less Than Perfect *Leverage *Lie to Me *Mad About You *Make It or Break It *Malcolm in the Middle *Melissa & Joey *Mike & Molly *The Mindy Project *Modern Family *Mom *Monk *Murphy Brown *My Name is Earl *Napoleon Dynamite *NCIS: New Orleans *New Girl *Numb3rs *Nurse Jackie *NYPD Blue *The O.C. *The Office *The Originals *Orange Is the New Black *Once Upon a Time *Quantico *Pretty Little Liars *The Proud Family *Prison Break *Pushing Daisies *Raising Hope *Revenge *The Riches *Roseanne *Rules of Engagement *Scrubs *Scream Queens *The Secret Life of the American Teenager *Sex and the City *Shameless *The Simpsons *Six Feet Under *Smallville *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series *Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark *Still Standing *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody *Supernatural *SUPERSTORE *Teen Wolf *Terra Nova *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles *That '70s Show (Moved to Boomerang) *That's So Raven **A.N.T.
