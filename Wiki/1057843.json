 "text": "The WAGR P class were a pair of steam locomotives originally operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1896 to 1912. The P class were built in 1896 by James Martin & Coy of Gawler, South Australia to the same design as the South Australian Railways (SAR) Z class. Initially, the P class were used on mainline passenger work, most notably heading the inaugural train to Kalgoorlie in 1896. They became displaced in their niche of express passenger work with the arrival of the R class, and in 1912 both engines were sold to the Midland Railway Company of Western Australia (MRWA) but weren't suitable for regular service, No. 62 was loaned to the Public Works Department (PWD) from 1913 to 1914. An attempt was made to sell No. 63 into the timber industry though this was unsuccessful so it was renumbered 12 with No. 62 being used for spares, both locos were scrapped in 1929.
