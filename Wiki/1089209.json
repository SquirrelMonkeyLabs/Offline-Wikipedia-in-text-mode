 "text": "The Malaysian flying frog or red-legged tree frog (Leptomantis rufipes) is a frog. It lives in Indonesia and Malaysia. People have seen it 950 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that human beings have not changed. This frog lays eggs in foam nests on plants over water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but human beings continue to cut down the forests where it lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
