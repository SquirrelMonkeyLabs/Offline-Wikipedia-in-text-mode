 "text": "Mount Salak (, ) is an eroded volcano in West Java, Indonesia. Several satellite cones occur on the southeastern flank and in the northern pass. Two craters are located at the top. The mount has been a site of geothermal exploration. According to popular belief, the name \"Salak\" comes from salak, a tropical fruit. However, according to Sundanese tradition, the name is derived from the Sanskrit word \"salaka\", which means \"silver\". ==Aviation accidents== This mountainous area includes areas that should be avoided by pilots of both small and large aircraft. The geological conditions and the topography full of valleys covered with vegetation, accompanied by a climate (especially the fall of fog) that changes very quickly, is very dangerous for aviation. Aviation experts classify this mountain as \"mountain of death\" due to its long history of aviation accidents. The latest and largest accident was the crash of a Sukhoi Superjet 100 civilian airliner into a mountain cliff in 2012. == References == == Other websites == Salak Category:West Java",
