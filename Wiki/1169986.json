 "text": "Water Street is a street in Vancouver. Water Street is known for being a popular tourist area in Downtown Vancouver. It is located in the Gastown neighbourhood of Vancouver. Water Street was known as one of the main streets where businesses were located in Vancouver. It was originally named Front Street before city council decided to change the name to Water Street. The street used to flood during its early years because of high tides which rose from the nearby Burrard Inlet. Water Street is the longest stretch of street in Gastown that features businesses and shops. Gentrification on the street started to happen in the 1960s when the wholesale dry goods businesses left and more restaurants and shops started to open. During the Summer, Water Street is turns into a car-free, pedestrian-only area. This is to help cut down on carbon emissions and help businesses. The decision to create this area was controversial and some businesses called for the end of the project because of traffic and loss of revenue. Since 1973, the Gastown Grand Prix bike race runs through Water Street. ==References== Category:Streets in Vancouver",
