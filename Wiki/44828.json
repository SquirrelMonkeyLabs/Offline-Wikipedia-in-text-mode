 "text": "The Sport-Verein Werder von 1899 e. V. Bremen is a German football club playing in the city of Bremen. The club was founded in 1899 as FV Werder by a group of sixteen high school students. The students had won a football as prize in a tug of war competition. In 1920 the name was changed from FV to SV werder Bremen. In this year chess, baseball, cricket and track and field athletics became part of the club. But football was and still is the most important part of the club. The name \"Werder\" is a not very common regional word which means \"River peninsula\". The first play ground of Werder Bremen was beside the Weser river. Today they play in the Weserstadion. The club's first team plays in the German Bundesliga. The second team of Werder Bremen is playing in Germanys 4th league. The women team is playing in the Second Bundesliga.
