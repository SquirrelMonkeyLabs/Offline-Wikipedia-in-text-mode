 "text": "Conrad Robert Murray (born February 19, 1953) is an American cardiologist who is best known for his role as Michael Jackson's personal physician at the time of the pop star's death in June 2009. He was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 for administering a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol to Jackson, which led to the singer's fatal cardiac arrest. Murray was sentenced to four years in prison but was released in 2013 after serving about two years due to good behavior and overcrowding. The case received significant media attention and sparked discussions about celebrity healthcare, prescription drug use, and the responsibilities of physicians. Since his release, Murray has made various public appearances and has expressed his thoughts on the events surrounding Jackson's death and the impact it had on his life and career.
