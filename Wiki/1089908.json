The empire built many new train lines, and Lviv became an important place for trade and travel. Lviv was the capital of Galicia. It needed a big and modern train station to replace the old one. The old station was built between 1861 and 1862 in the neo-Gothic style. It was part of the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis. ==References== Category:Lviv Category:Railway stations in Ukraine Category:1904 establishments in Europe Category:20th-century establishments in Ukraine",
