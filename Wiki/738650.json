 "text": "Virginia Joan Kennedy (n√©e Bennett, born September 2, 1936) is an American socialite, singer, author, and former model. She was the first wife of U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. In July 1969, Ted Kennedy was involved in a car accident at a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts that resulted in the death of his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Although pregnant and confined to bed in the wake of two previous miscarriages, Joan attended Kopechne's funeral. Three days later, she stood beside her husband in a local court when he pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. She suffered a third miscarriage soon afterwards. In 1992, she published the book The Joy of Classical Music: A Guide for You and Your Family. Kennedy has worked with children's charities, remains an accomplished pianist and has taught classical music to children. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Kennedy family Category:American autobiographers Category:American philanthropists Category:Models from New York City Category:Writers from New York City Category:Singers from Massachusetts",
