They fled to Eastern Europe after the fall of the Khazar empire. ===Origin=== French scholar Ernest Renan created the Khazar myth in 1808 AD. Since then, it has been promoted by fascists,, citing letters of 10 July 1938 and 24/25 September 1955. Ahearn speculates that [Ezra] Pound may have thought:'If there were no such people as Jews, then the problem of indiscriminate anti-Semitism would disappear. On could focus one’s attention on usurers of whatever description.' KKK,.'The formative period of Christian Identity could roughly be said to be the three decades between 1940 and 1970. Through missionaries like Wesley Swift, Bertrand Comparet and William Potter Gale, it took on a white racialist, anti- Semitic, anti-Communist and far-right conservative political outlook. Combined with the teachings of early disciples Richard G. Butler, Colonel Jack Mohr and James K. Warner, a distinctly racist theology was gradually formed. Whites were said to be the Adamic people, created in His likeness. A notion of a pre- earthly existence is found in an important substratum, teaching that whites either had a spiritual or extraterrestrial pre-existence. Blacks were either pre-Adamic soulless creatures or represented fallen, evil spirits, but they were not the chief target of fear and hatred. This position was reserved for Jews. The latent anti-Semitism found in British-Israelism rose to prominence. Jews were, at best, reduced to mongrelized imposters, not infrequently identified with Eurasian Khazars without any legitimate claim to a closeness with God, and at worst denounced as the offspring of Satan.'

This antisemitic stereotype is a major theme in modern antisemitic propaganda worldwide, with some influence in Western academia. ==Research== The Khazar myth is an unscientific conspiracy theory. In several papers, Israeli-American scholar Eran Elhaik claimed he had evidence for the Khazar myth. Several other biologists criticized Elhaik and conducted genetic studies that disproved his claims. In response, Elhaik accused the biologists of being \"liars\" and \"frauds\". He denied that he had ever misused his genomic data to defame the Jewish people. His papers have given support to antisemites who promote the Khazar myth. ==Related pages== * Pseudoscience * Antisemitism in Europe * Antisemitism in the Soviet Union * The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ==References== Category:Racism Category:Antisemitism Category:Pseudoscience Category:Jewish people Category:Jewish history Category:Discrimination Category:Disinformation Category:History of Europe Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Germany",
