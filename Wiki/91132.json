 "text": "\"Mississippi\" John Smith Hurt (July 2, 1892,There is confusion about his date of birth, but the grave mentions this date. Teoc, Mississippi - November 2, 1966, Grenada, Mississippi) was an American blues singer and guitarist. ==Life== Hurt was raised in Avalon. He tought himself playing guitar at the age of nine. While he was working as a sharecropper, he played at local dances and parties. He did his first recording in 1928 for Okeh Records but was not successful. So he worked on as a sharecropper and played on at the local parties. Two of Hurt's songs were included in the album The Anthology of American Folk Music and an Australian found a copy of Avalon Blues. So the interest in finding John Hurt himself increased. In 1963 Tom Hoskins found him in Avalon and found out that his musical skill was still intact. He brought him to Washington, D. C. He started playing at greater festivals like the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. In his later years he often played in colleges, concert halls, coffee houses and also on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He also recorded three albums for Vanguard Records and recorded most of his songs for the Library of Congress. Hurt influenced different music genres like blues, country, bluegrass, folk and contemporary rock and roll. ==Death== Hurt died on November 2, 1966 from a heart attack in Grenada, Mississippi. ==Discography== # \"Frankie\" (3:21)- February 24, 1928, Memphis, TN - 400221-B, OK 8560 # \"Nobody's Dirty Business\" (2:52)- February 24, 1928, Memphis - 400223-B, OK 8560 # \"Ain't No Tellin'\" (2:54)- December 21, 1928, New York City, NY - 401471-A, OK 8560 # \"Louis Collins\" (2:57)- December 21, 1928, NYC - 401472-A, OK 8724 # \"Avalon Blues\" (3:01)- December 21, 1928, NYC - 401473-B, OK 8759 # \"Big Leg Blues\" (2:50)- December 21, 1928, NYC - 401474-B, unissued # \"Stack O' Lee\" (2:55)- December 28, 1928, NYC - 401481-B, OK 8654 # \"Candy Man Blues\" (2:44)- December 28, 1928, NYC - 401483-B, OK 8654 # \"Got The Blues (Can't Be Satisfied)\" (2:49)- Dec 28, 1928, NYC- 401484-B, OK 8734 # \"Blessed Be The Name\" (2:46)- December 28, 1928, NYC - 401485-B, OK 8666 # \"Praying On The Old Camp Ground\" (2:35)- Dec 28 1928, NYC- 401486-B, OK 8666 # \"Blue Harvest Blues\" (2:51)- December 28, 1928 NYC - 401487-A, OK 8692 # \"Spike Driver Blues\"Spike Driver's Blues is about the Afro-American folk hero John Henry (folklore).
