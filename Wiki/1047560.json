 "text": "The Chaos is a poem that shows the irregularities of the English language pronounciation. It was written by Gerard Nolst Trenité (1870-1946). Noist Trenité was a Dutch language teacher. The first version of the poem can be found in his book Drop Your Foreign Accent: engelsche uitspraakoefeningen which was published in 1920.The poem shows that there are many words that are not pronounced the way they are written. Originally, it was made of 146 lines of verse. Until 1992/1993, decades after his death, Spelling Society extended it to 274 lines. In total, the poem covers 800 cases of irregular English pronunciation. == Partial text == These lines are set out as in the author's version, with alternate couplets indented and the problematic words italicised. > Dearest creature in Creation, Studying English pronunciation, It will keep > you, Susy, busy, Make your head with heat grow dizzy; Pray, console your > loving poet, Make my coat look new, dear, sew it?
