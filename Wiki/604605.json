 "text": "Maroon are Africans who escaped from the slavery in the Americas and who mixed with the native Americans. The fabric of slavery faced a formidable challenge as significant numbers of Africans sought refuge in remote areas, crafting what became known as maroon communities. Sprouting across the Americas, notably in the Caribbean and Brazil, these communities thrived with their distinct culture, governance, commerce, and defensive structures, defying the dominion of European and American oppressors. Their aspiration was simple yet profound: to carve out lives of liberty, beyond the reach and sway of plantation owners or colonial authorities. The term \"maroon,\" documented in English since 1666, draws its origins from different sources. Some suggest it stems from the French \"marron,\" denoting a \"runaway black slave,\" while others link it to the American/Spanish \"cimarrón,\" meaning a \"wild runaway slave,\" often described as \"the untamable beast\" or \"dwelling on mountaintops.\" Initially, the Spanish applied this term to their wandering cattle, with \"cimarrón\" believed to derive from \"cima,\" meaning \"summit.\" == Maroon Communities == Most of the Maroon lived around Caribbean Island, and in Americas. * Brazil * Jamaica * Haiti * Suriname (the former Dutch Guiana) * Cuba * Puerto Rico * St. Vincent * Guyana * Dominica * Panama * Colombia * Mexico * Amazon River Basin ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in North America Category:Ethnic groups in South America",
