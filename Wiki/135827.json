 "text": "Murray Newton Rothbard (March 2, 1926 – January 7, 1995) was an American economist and writer. He helped make the Austrian School of economics popular in the United States. Rothbard helped to create modern libertarianism, a political belief in less government and more personal freedom. He founded a form of free-market anarchism which he called \"anarcho-capitalism\". Rothbard believed society should organise itself, and he didn't like central planning.Noce, Jaime E. & Miskelly, Matthew 2002. Anarchism: political theories for students. Gale. p7 Rothbard wrote over twenty books and was an important central figure in the American libertarian movement.Ronald Hamowy, Editor, The encyclopedia of libertarianism, p 441. == His ideas == Rothbard supported the abolition of government. He considered the government having a monopoly on force the greatest danger to liberty and the long-term well-being of the people. He called the state a \"gang of thieves writ large — the most immoral, grasping and unscrupulous individuals in any society\".The ethics of liberty, Murray RothbardRepudiating the National Debt , Murray RothbardTo save our economy from destruction, Murray Rothbard Rothbard thought that all services provided by monopoly governments could be provided more efficiently by the private sector. According to him, many regulations and laws passed \"for the public interest\" were self-interested power grabs by scheming government bureaucrats to make themselves look important. These schemes were not subject to market disciplines. Government services were not efficient, and would get eliminated, if the services could be provided by competition in the private sector.The Great Society: a libertarian critique, Murray RothbardThe noble task of revisionism , Murray RothbardThe fallacy of the 'public sector', Murray Rothbard Rothbard was equally condemning of big business working with government. Business elites, he thought, used government's monopoly power so as to influence laws and regulatory policy to help themselves at the expense of their competitive rivals.For a new liberty, Chapter 3 He argued that taxation was theft on a grand scale, backed by law. It was \"a compulsory monopoly of force\" which prevented the more efficient voluntary procurement of defense and judicial services from competing suppliers.Tax day , Murray Rothbard He also argued against central banking and fractional reserve banking.By 'fractional reserve banking' is meant banks who do not keep enough reserves to cover their debts. A monopoly system where the government decides how much money to print is, to him, a form of state-sponsored, legalized financial fraud. It is against libertarian principles and ethics.Rothbard, Murray.
