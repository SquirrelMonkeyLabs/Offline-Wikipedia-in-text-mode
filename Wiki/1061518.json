The event aired as special episode of Rampage and as the show's second episode overall. The name of the event is a reference to 2020 Netflix documentary The Last Dance about Michael Jordan and the 1997â€“98 Chicago Bulls season. The First Dance also took place in the Bulls' home arena. The main event of the show saw Jon Moxley defeat Daniel Garcia. Moxley countered Garcia's sharpshooter into his Bulldog Choke. Garcia tapped out and Moxley got the victory. The event is best known for CM Punk making his debut for All Elite Wrestling (AEW).
