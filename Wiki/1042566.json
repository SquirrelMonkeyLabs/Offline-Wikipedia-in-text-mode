 "text": "Syndicalism is a socio-political movement that originated in France during the late 19th century. It aims to transfer the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution to workers' unions. This influential movement, strongly influenced by the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the French social philosopher Georges Sorel, gained significant traction between 1900 and 1914. This was a time when the working class was looking for fair treatment. Syndicalism found support not only in France but also in countries like Italy, Spain, and the United States, where workers were also fighting for their rights. It brought together trade unions, which became the driving force behind the movement, and advocated for worker control and self-management. Syndicalism represented a radical departure from traditional labor movements. It emphasized direct action and the overthrow of existing capitalist systems that exploited workers. It sought to create a society where workers held the power and decisions were made collectively within their unions, envisioning a more equitable and just future for the working class. == References == Category:Political movements",
