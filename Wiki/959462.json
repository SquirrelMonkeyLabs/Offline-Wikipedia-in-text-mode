 "text": "The Sugar Land Space Cowboys are a Minor League Baseball team from Sugar Land, Texas, part of the Greater Houston metropolitan area. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB), against other baseball teams in the Pacific Coast League (a group of 10 baseball teams at the same level). The Space Cowboys are partnered with the Houston Astros, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Astros. The team started playing baseball as the Sugar Land Skeeters in 2012. They were a part of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, a baseball league not partnered with MLB. Their name was another word for mosquitos, which can be found in Texas. They won championships in 2016 and 2018. In 2022, the team was bought by the Houston Astros and their name was changed to the Space Cowboys. The name was chosen because of their partnership with the Astros, Sugar Land's location near NASA's Johnson Space Center, and the area's cowboy culture. The Space Cowboys play at a stadium called Constellation Field. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:2010s establishments in the United States Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Houston Astros Category:Sports in Texas",
