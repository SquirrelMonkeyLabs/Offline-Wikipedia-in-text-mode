 "text": "Bhopal State (pronounced ) was an independent state of 18th century India. It was founded in 1723. It was a princely state of the British Raj from 1818 to 1947. It was an independent country from 1947 to 1949. At first, the capital was Islamnagar. Later the capital moved to the city of Bhopal. ==Rule of the Begums== Bhopal was the second largest Muslim state in pre-independence India, after Hyderabad. Between 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by four women – Begums – unique in the royalty of those days. Qudsia Begum was the first woman ruler, who was succeeded by her only daughter Sikandar Begum, who in turn was succeeded by her only daughter, Shahjehan Begum. Jahan Begum was the last woman ruler, who after 25 years of rule, abdicated in favour of her son, Nawab Sir Hamidullah Khan. The rule of Begums gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system and a municipality constituted in 1907. The peaceful rule of Begums led to the rise of a unique mixed culture in Bhopal. The Hindus were given important administrative positions in the state. This led to communal peace and a cosmopolitan culture took its roots. ==Sources== Category:Indian princely states Category:1723 establishments Category:1949 disestablishments in Asia Category:18th-century establishments in India Category:1940s disestablishments in India Category:1720s establishments in Asia",
