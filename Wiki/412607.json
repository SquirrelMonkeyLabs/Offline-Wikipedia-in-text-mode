 "text": "The Lavasoa dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus lavasoensis) is a newly discovered primate. It is a small nocturnal species of lemur found on Madagascar. It lives in three small, isolated patches of forest on the southern slopes of the Lavasoa Mountains in southern Madagascar. Fewer than 50 individuals are thought to exist. Its habitat lies in a transitional zone between three ecoregions: dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest (near and in water), and humid forest. It was first collected in 2001, and was thought to be a subpopulation of the furry-eared dwarf lemur (C. crossleyi). It was not formally described until 2013. It is one of six species of dwarf lemur. The research also suggested the existence of other new species. == References == Category:Lemuriformes Category:Mammals of Africa",
