 "text": "The Oromo are a Cushitic ethnic group from the Oromia region of Ethiopia and parts of Northern Kenya. They speak the Oromo language. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia. The Oromo people traditionally used the gadaa system. A leader is elected by the gadaa system for eight years, with an election taking place at the end of those eight years. Although most modern Oromos are Muslims and Christians, about 3% practice Waaqeffanna, the native ancient monotheistic religion of Oromos. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Ethiopia Category:Oromia",
