 "text": "Sugarcane juice is the liquid extracted from pressed sugarcane. Especially, in places where sugarcane is grown commercially, it is a popular drink. Today, most sugarcane comes from Southeast Asia, India, Northern Africa, and Latin America. In Spanish-speaking countries, sugarcane juice is usually called Guarapo, or guarapa. In Portugese, it is called garapa. These names can also refer to palm syrup. In the United States where processed sugarcane syrup is used as a sweetener in food and beverage manufacturing, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers \"evaporated cane juice\" to be a misleading term for \"sugar\" on product labels. The FDA regards \"juice\" as a liquid derived from fruits or vegetables, so the preferred term is \"cane sugar\". In Brazil, laboratories use sugarcane juice to make ethanol fuel. ==Gallery== File:Guarapo presse.JPG|Making Guarapo, in Vi√±ales, Cuba.
