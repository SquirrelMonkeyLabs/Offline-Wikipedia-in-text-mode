 "text": "Henry Way Kendall (December 9, 1926 â€“ February 15, 1999) was an American particle physicist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1990 with Jerome Isaac Friedman and Richard E. Taylor for their works on the scattering of electrons on protons and the creation of the quark model in particle physics. Kendall was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He studied at Amherst College and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kendall died, aged 72, while diving the cave at the Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park in Wakulla County, Florida on February 15, 1999. He ran out of oxygen while ignoring safety protocols, which his autopsy found to be on purpose because of a physiological issue. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:American physicists Category:Stanford University faculty Category:Scientists from Boston Category:Writers from Boston Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty",
