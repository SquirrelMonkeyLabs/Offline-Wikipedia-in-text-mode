In the modern day, PAC spectroscopy is widely used in the study of condensed matter physics. Frauenfelder was born in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. He studied at ETH Zurich. Within biophysics, he is known for experiment and theory in understanding the dynamical behavior of protein tertiary structure. In 1992, Frauenfelder won the Max Delbruck Prize. Frauenfelder is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. ==References== ==Other websites== * References on Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) * PAC Spectroscopy * Frauenfelder's homepage * Frauenfelder's math genealogy Category:1922 births Category:Living people Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:American physicists Category:American biologists Category:Swiss physicists Category:People from Schaffhausen Category:American centenarians",
