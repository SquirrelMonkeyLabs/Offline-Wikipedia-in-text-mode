 "text": "The length of the day is how long a day is. On Earth, a sidereal day is 23 hours and 56 minutes long, and a solar day is 24 hours. There are other planets with different types of day. == Length of the day on other planets == This uses Earth time.Enchanted Learning.com * Mercury - about 59 days * Venus - 243 days * Earth - 1 day * Mars - about 1 day, 0.6 hours * Jupiter - 9 hours * Saturn - about 10 hours * Uranus - about 13 hours * Neptune - about 15 hours == Increasing day length on Earth == The Earth is constantly losing angular velocity and rotational energy through a process called tidal acceleration, which leads to a slow lengthening of the day. Tidal acceleration is an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite (e.g. the Moon), and the primary planet that it orbits (e.g. Earth). A century ago, the average day was about 1.7 milliseconds shorter than today.McCarthy D.D. & Seidelmann P.K. 2009. Time: from Earth rotation to atomic physics. Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, pp. 88-89 In the late Neoproterozoic about 620 million years ago a day had only about 21.9Â±0.4 hours. == Related pages == *Sidereal day *Rotation period == References == Category:Days Category:Earth sciences",
