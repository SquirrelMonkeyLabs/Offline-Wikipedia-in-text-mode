 "text": "Photo cleaning activities involve carefully removing each photo from an album that has been soiled by seawater or mud, cleaning the surface to prevent deterioration by bacteria or mold, drying the photos after washing, and then placing them in new pocket albums. This process is repeated for each photo. During the cleaning process, additional efforts are made to help the owner easily identify their photos. This includes wiping the dirty album covers with a wet towel, preserving any discovery clues, transcribing notes written on album pages or the back of photos onto separate sheets, and creating lists describing the events or scenes in the photos. These steps are taken to make it easier for owners to find their photos. == References == Category:Photography",
