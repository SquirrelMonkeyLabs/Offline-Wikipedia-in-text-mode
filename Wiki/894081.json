 "text": "Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes defective connective tissue. This can effect the skeleton, heart blood vessels, eyes and lungs. Normally, the interstitial space of body tissue is full of microfibrils. This is strong rope like structure that provide tissue integrity and common connective tissue. The main component of microfibrils is a glycoprotein called fibrillin. Approximately 1 in 5000 individuals is affected by Marfan syndrome. Around 75% of those with the condition inherit it from a parent. However, in some cases, Marfan syndrome occurs in someone with no family history of the disorder, which is referred to as a spontaneous mutation. == References == Category:Genetic disorders",
