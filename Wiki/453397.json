 "text": "The Dyatlov Pass incident is an unsolved mystery to the deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural mountains on the night of February 2, 1959. The incident happened on the east shoulder of the mountain Kholat Syakhl (Холат- Сяхыл, a Mansi name, meaning Dead Mountain). The mountain pass where the incident occurred has since been named Dyatlov Pass (Перевал Дятлова) after the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov (Игорь Дятлов). To this day, the incident has not been solved. ==Background== A group was formed for a ski trek across the northern Urals in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The group, led by Igor Dyatlov, consisted of eight men and two women. Most were students or graduates of Ural Polytechnical Institute (Уральский Политехнический Институт, УПИ), now Ural Federal University: # Igor Alekseievich Dyatlov (Игорь Алексеевич Дятлов), the group's leader, born January 13, 1936 # Zinaida Alekseevna Kolmogorova (Зинаида Алексеевна Колмогорова), born January 12, 1937 # Lyudmila Alexandrovna Dubinina (Людмила Александровна Дубинина), born May 12, 1938 # Alexander Sergeievich Kolevatov (Александр Сергеевич Колеватов), born November 16, 1934 # Rustem Vladimirovich Slobodin (Рустем Владимирович Слободин), born January 11, 1936 # Yuri (Georgiy) Alexeievich Krivonischenko (Юрий (Георгий) Алексеевич Кривонищенко), born February 7, 1935 # Yuri Nikolaievich Doroshenko (Юрий Николаевич Дорошенко), born January 29, 1938 # Nicolai Vladimirovich Thibeaux-Brignolles (Николай Владимирович Тибо-Бриньоль), born July 5, 1935 # Semyon (Alexander) Alexandrovich Zolotariov (Семен (Александр) Александрович Золотарёв), born February 2, 1921 # Yuri Yefimovich Yudin (Юрий Ефимович Юдин) (abandoned group because of illness), born July 19, 1937, died April 27, 2013 ==What killed the hikers?== It is not known what happened to the hikers. The most likely thing is that an avalanche hit them, and some of them struggled on until they died of cold and exposure. Only one hiker who left the group before the event happened survived. Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries. ==Theories== There are many conspiracy theories towards what killed the hikers. Many Russians believe that a local tribe called the Mansi people killed them for trespassing on their property. Others believe that the military had something to do with their death. High levels of radiation were found on their clothing so some believe that a missile misfired and crashed nearby the hikers. ==What investigators discovered== Investigators at the time discovered that the hikers tore open their tent from inside, ran barefoot into heavy snow and a temperature of .
