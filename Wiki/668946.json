 "text": "Twice () is a South Korean girl group. The group was created through the reality show Sixteen. There are nine members in the group. They are Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung and Tzuyu. On October 20, 2015, Twice released their first extended play The Story Begins. ==History== ===2013–2015: Creation through Sixteen and debut mini album=== On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment announced that they would create a new girl group in the first half of 2014, the first all girl group to come out of the company since Miss A in 2010. On February 27, 2014, JYP trainees Lena and Cecila were confirmed as members of the group called 6mix, while other rumored members included Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Minyoung. The group was eventually cancelled when Lena and Cecilia left the company. In February, Park Jin-young announced the lineup of the upcoming girl group would feature seven members and be decided through Sixteen, a television competition show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun and Chaeyoung as the seven Twice members. Later, Park decided to add two more girls into the group, making Twice a nine member group by adding Tzuyu, who was added as the audience favorite due to bring the most popular contestant by the end of the show and Momo, who was added by Park himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. Momo had already been eliminated a few episodes before the finale, so the decision was disliked by some fans. On October 7, 2015 the group's official website was created and their first extended play, The Story Begins, would be released with the single \"Like Ooh- Ahh\" which was released on October 20. On the same day as their EP's release the group performed all tracks at a live performance. The music video was watched 50 million times on YouTube within five months of it's release and became one of the most-viewed debut music videos of any K-pop group. The group performed \"Like Ooh-Ahh\" at SBS Gayo Daejeon at the end of 2015. ===2016–2017: Rise in popularity, first tour and first album in Japanese=== Twice released their second EP, Page Two, on April 25, 2016. It included their singles \"Cheer Up\" and \"I'm Gonna Be A Star\", the second which served as the theme song for Sixteen. On May 5 Twice won their first music show award with \"Cheer Up\" on M Countdown, which fell exactly one year after the first episode aired of Sixteen. By August, Page Two had sold over 150,000 copies making Twice the first girl group to have a sales record of more than 100,000 units that year. ===2018–present=== In January, Twice began their first Japanese tour which was held from January 19th until February 1. Afterwards, Twice released their second Japanese single, \"Candy Pop\", on February 7, 2018. On April 9, they released their fifth EP, What Is Love?. This EP gave Twice the title of the first female artists to gain a Platinum award in Korea, selling over 250,000 copies of the album. On April 24, Twice released the music video for their third Japanese album, Wake Me Up, which was released on May 16, 2018. The release of the single album broke records of first day sales. Twice broke records in Japan with their three singles having sold almost 300,000 copies in the first week of being released. ==Awards and nominations== Twice received its first-ever nomination and award at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards with the Best New Female Artist award, followed by another New Artist Award at the 2016 Golden Disc Awards. == Members == * Nayeon () * Jeongyeon () * Momo () * Sana () * Jihyo () – leader * Mina () * Dahyun () * Chaeyoung () * Tzuyu () == References == Category:2010s South Korean music groups Category:2015 establishments in South Korea Category:2020s South Korean music groups Category:J-pop music groups Category:JYP Entertainment artists Category:K-pop music groups Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:South Korean girl groups",
