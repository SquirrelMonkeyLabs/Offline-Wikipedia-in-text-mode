 "text": "MOVE is a Philadelphia-based black liberation group founded by John Africa (born Vincent Leaphart) in 1972. The group lives communally. The group had two major conflicts with the Philadelphia Police Department. In 1978, a standoff resulted in the death of one police officer, injuries to several other people, and life sentences for nine members. In 1985, another standoff ended when a police helicopter dropped a bomb on their compound. This was a row house in the middle of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue. The bomb caused a fire, and killed eleven MOVE members, including five children. The fire burst out of control and destroyed 65 houses in the neighborhood, prompting widespread news coverage. ==References== Category:Cults Category:Philadelphia Category:1972 establishments in the United States Category:1970s establishments in Pennsylvania",
