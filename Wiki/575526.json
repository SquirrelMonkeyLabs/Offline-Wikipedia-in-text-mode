When Dr. Nasim Hasan Shah retired as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1994, Justice Saad Saud Jan should have taken his place based on seniority. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto threw tradition overboard, when she by-passed two senior judges and appointed Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Later, she was fired by President Farooq Leghari on charges of corruption and Sajjad Ali Shah along with 6 other members of the Supreme Court were fired as well. Sajjad Ali Shah was born in Karachi. He studied at the University of Karachi. Sajjad Ali Shah died of pneumonia on 7 March 2017 in Karachi, aged 84. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Pakistani lawyers Category:Politicians from Karachi",
