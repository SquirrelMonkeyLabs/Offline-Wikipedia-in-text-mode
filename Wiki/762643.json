 "text": "The Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone was the border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In 1954, after the Viet Minh defeated France during the First Indochina War, France gave up control of Vietnam, but France also split Vietnam in two halves. The Vietnamese DMZ would be a place where many battles would take place during the Vietnam War. After North Vietnam successfully invaded South Vietnam at the end of the war in 1975, the Vietnamese DMZ was no more, and the two countries united into one Vietnam in 1976.
