 "text": "Passover () is a religious holiday or festival noted by ceremonies each year by Jewish people. They celebrate it to remember when God used Moses to free the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, as told in the book of Exodus in the Bible. God told Moses to set aside this special week originally called \"the feast of unleavened bread\". During this time, the people eat special foods, do special rituals and sing special songs. Passover starts on the 15th of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar, which falls in March or April. ==Second Passover== The \"Second Passover\" (Pesach Sheni) on the 15th of Iyar in the Hebrew Calendar is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the Passover sacrifice at the appropriate time. ==References== Category:Jewish festivals and holidays",
