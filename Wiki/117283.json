 "text": "Azrael is the archangel of death. It is an English form of the Arabic name Azra'il or Azra'eil (), the name traditionally attributed to the angel of death in Islam and some Hebrew lore. The Qur'an never uses this name, referring instead to Malaikat al-Maut (which translates directly as angels of death; not one angel). It is also spelled Izrail, Izrael, Azrail, Ezraeil, Azraille, or Ozryel. Chambers English dictionary uses the spelling Azrael. The name means Whom God Helps. In Islam, Azrael is like death. But, because he is an angel, he does only whatever God tells him to do. Because many people die around the world, Azrael has helpers; other angels of death who are also mentioned in the Quran. * Category:Islam",
