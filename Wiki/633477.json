 "text": "The Alfie Evans case was a legal case in 2018 involving Alfie Evans (May 9, 2016 â€“ April 28, 2018), a baby from Liverpool with an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder. ==Overview== The medical team and the child's parents disagreed about whether to keep Evans' life support or to remove it, resulting in a legal battle. ==Events== On December 19, 2017, Alder Hey applied to the High Court of Justice to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation. The High Court ruled in favour of the hospital on February 20, 2018. The ventilatory support was removed on April 23, 2018 following a series of unsuccessful appeals from Alfie's family. Alfie continued to breathe naturally after the removal of his breathing tube. He died on 28 April 2018 at the age of 1. ==References== Category:2016 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Controversies Category:People from Liverpool Category:2017 in the United Kingdom Category:Disease-related deaths in England",
