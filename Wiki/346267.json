It stars Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbitt and Dustin Hoffman as his older brother Raymond Babbitt. Charlie is a narcissist who is a dealer of new cars in Los Angeles, California. He hears of his father's death and is told that the vast majority of the estate has been left to Raymond, whom he cannot remember. Raymond is an autistic savant, who has an eidetic memory but is incapable of looking after himself. He has lived in an institution in Cincinnati, Ohio for about twenty years. Charlie drives Raymond to Las Vegas, Nevada where Raymond uses his skill at counting cards to win money in card games. They then go on to Los Angeles. During the journey, Charlie changes his feelings towards Raymond from being resentful to being caring and protective. Raymond lacks understanding of the world and requires 24 hour care, which Charlie cannot provide, so Raymond returns to his institution. Rain Man won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. The movie was inspired by the life of savant Kim Peek (1951â€“2009). == Other websites == * Category:1988 movies Category:1980s drama movies Category:1980s road movies Category:American drama movies Category:American road movies Category:Autism in fiction Category:Best Picture Oscar Category:English-language movies Category:Golden Globe Award winning movies Category:Las Vegas in fiction Category:Movies set in Las Vegas Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Narcissism in fiction Category:Ohio in fiction Category:Movies directed by Barry Levinson Category:Movies about autism Category:Movies composed by Hans Zimmer",
