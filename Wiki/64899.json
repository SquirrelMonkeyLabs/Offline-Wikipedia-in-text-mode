 "text": "The Eye of Horus was an important symbol in ancient Egypt. It was the symbol of protection and Royal Power from Ra or Horus. Horus was an ancient Egyptian sky god in the form of a falcon. The right eye represents a peregrine falcon's eye and the markings around it. This includes the \"teardrop\" marking sometimes found below the eye. As the wadjet (also udjat or utchat), it also represented the sun, and was associated with the Sun God Ra (Re). The \"mirror image\", or left eye, represented the moon and the God Tehuti (Thoth). ==In arithmetic== In the ancient Egyptian measurement system, the Eye Of Horus defined an Old Kingdom rounded off number one(1) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64, by throwing away 1/64. * 1/2 was represented by smell. This was symbolized by the right side of the eye in a form of the nose. * 1/4 was represented by sight or the sensation of light. This was symbolized by the pupil. * 1/8 was represented by thought. This was symbolized by the eyebrow. * 1/16 was represented by hearing. This was symbolized by the left side of the eye in the form of an arrow pointing towards the ear. * 1/32 was represented by taste, by the sprouting of wheat or grain from the planted stalk. This was symbolized by a curved tail. * 1/64 was represented by touch. This was symbolized by a leg touching the ground, or what can also be thought of as a strong plant growing into the surface of the earth. ==References== ==Other websites== *Eye of Horus fractions *www.themystica.com Category:Egyptian mythology Category:Mathematics",
