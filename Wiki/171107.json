 "text": "Kleptomania (, \"to steal\", μανία, \"mania\") is an impulse control disorder. It is mental disorder with a frequent urge of stealing. Kleptomaniacs often steal many of the same thing and hoard, throw away or give away the things they steal. Some may not be aware that they have committed the theft. It is often found in people who have other mental disorders, such as depression, panic attacks, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug addiction. The condition is more common in females, and especially those with bulimia. ==References== Category:Impulse control disorders",
