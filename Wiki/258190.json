He kept this job until his death. He was knighted in 1932. ==Compositions== Most of Bairstow's compositions are for church services. He wrote 29 anthems. It includes the famous Blessed city, heavenly Salem It has a very dramatic organ accompaniment. It is about the heavenly city where the souls of people who have died will go. Two other popular anthems I sat down under his shadow and Let all mortal flesh keep silence, both of which are for unaccompanied choir. He also composed service settings, psalm chants, hymn tunes, and a cantata, The Prodigal Son, for choir and chamber orchestra. ==References== *Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.
