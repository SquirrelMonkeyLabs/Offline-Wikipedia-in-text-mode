They will still need follow-up appointments to make sure the hip is healing. Most people can resume their daily activities after six weeks. A patient may be discharged from the hospital after 2 to 4 days. There are some ways that help someone speed up the recovery after surgery. == References == Category:Joints Category:Surgery",
