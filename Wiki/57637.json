 "text": "A red dwarf is a kind of star. Red dwarf stars are smaller than half the size of the Sun. They are also cooler than most stars. Red dwarfs burn their fuel slowly, so they shine with less light (absolute magnitude) than hot stars. Red dwarf stars are the most common in our galaxy, at least near our sun. (We cannot see them if they are in other distant galaxies.) However, since red dwarf stars are cool and small, none can be found with the naked eye. The closest star to the Earth is named Proxima Centauri. The Latin word proxima means \"nearest to\". Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf. == Life and death == Red dwarfs can live trillions of years, much longer than brighter stars. A red dwarf dies when it burns all of its fuel. To start with, the fuel is the chemical element hydrogen. At present, no red dwarf star is known which has gone beyond this stage, because the universe is only 14 billion years old.. Red dwarfs are small stars that are around 0.2 solar mass (the sun is equal to 1 solar mass). This is small for a star but is still 60,000 times the mass of the Earth. They are formed in nebulas, as all stars are, and originally they were protostars. They start their nuclear fusion about 100,000 years after being formed. This gives them their red glow. These stars burn at less than 4,000Â°K. Ultracool Dwarfs Ultracool dwarfs are the smallest type of red dwarf. Below is a list of the smallest red dwarfs. One example of an ultracool dwarf is TRAPPIST-1. Top 12 smallest red dwarfs Name Radius (Solar radii) Notes CWISE J124909.08+362116.0 0.08 Most likely a brown dwarf.
