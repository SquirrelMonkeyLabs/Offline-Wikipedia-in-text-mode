 "text": "The Hakurk and Zap attack in December 2023 is a series of coordinated clashes led by the PKK against Turkish military bases located in northern Iraq, in the Hakurk and Zap regions, two strategic areas where the Turkish military Operation Claw-Lock against the PKK is taking place. ==Attack of Xakurk== On December 22, the PKK attacked a Turkish military base in the Hakurk mountainous region, near the border between Turkey and Iraq. This attack was conducted using guerrilla tactics, including ambushes, rockets and small arms, which are common techniques for the PKK, which knows the mountainous terrain perfectly. The attack killed 6 Turkish soldiers, according to the Turkish Ministry of Defense. However, the PKK claimed to have killed 27 soldiers and captured the weapons of 17 other Turkish soldiers. This figure remains not independently verified, but it has been widely disseminated by sources close to the PKK. Turkish forces responded to this attack with air strikes on PKK positions in the region. ==Attack of Zap== The next day, the PKK again struck, this time in the Zap region, another strategic area for the Turkish army. The attack followed a tactic similar to Hakurk's, with ambushes and the use of small arms and rockets. During this attack, 6 other Turkish soldiers were killed. In response, Turkey claimed to have neutralized 13 PKK fighters during subsequent air strikes. The term “neutralized” used by Turkey generally includes those killed, injured or captured. ==Related pages== • Operation Claw-Lock • Operation Northern Iraq (2023) == References == == Other websites == * example.com Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2025",
