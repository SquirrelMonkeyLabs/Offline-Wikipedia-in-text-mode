 "text": "The 2022 Copa América Femenina was a big football tournament for women in South America. It was the 9th time they had this competition. Teams from different South American countries played against each other. They played these matches in Colombia from 8th to 30th July 2022. This competition was important because the teams were trying to earn a spot in two other big tournaments the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, and the 2023 Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile. Some teams could go straight to these tournaments, and others had to play more matches to get there. Also, the teams that made it to the final match got a chance to play in the 2024 Summer Olympics in France. Brazil was really good at this competition. They have won it four times before, and this time they won again by beating Colombia 1-0 in the final match. So, Brazil became the champions for the 8th time. As winners, they got to play against England, who won another big competition in Europe, in a special match called the 2023 Women's Finalissima. == Teams == All ten teams of women's football from CONMEBOL were allowed to join in.
