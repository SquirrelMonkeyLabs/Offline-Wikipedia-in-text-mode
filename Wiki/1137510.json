 "text": "The Syr Darya sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi) is a species of sturgeon native to Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. There is a very small number of individuals, so it could probably be \"extinct\". It is from the genus Pseudoscaphirhynchus. IUCN lists this fish as a critically endangered species. Before, it used to live in the Aral Sea, but that lake has dried up already. == References == # Mugue, N. & Karimov, B. (2022). \"Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi\".
