The 2020s began with the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to an economic downturn. The World Health Organization declared the virus a global state of emergency from March 2020 to May 2023. Populism saw a rise in the late-early to mid-2020s. There were protests against governments in many countries. The 2020s saw the continuation of several wars, including the Mali War, Somali Civil War, Syrian civil war, and the Russo-Ukrainian War. In 2021, the war in Afghanistan ended with the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. In 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine became the largest war in Europe since World War II. In 2023, a Hamas- led attack on Israel led to the Israel-Hamas War. In 2024, a rebel offensive during the Syrian civil war led to the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, improved in the 2020s. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in the use of video calls, online learning, streaming services, and online shopping. 5G networks launched around the globe at the start of the decade and became common in smartphones. Research into outer space further grew in the 2020s, with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope, Ingenuity helicopter, and Artemis program. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have increased in popularity. == Events == === 2020 === * In 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union.
