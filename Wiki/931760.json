 "text": "Tropicalia's snouted tree frog (Scinax tropicalia) is a frog. Scientists found two different groups of these frogs, both in Brazil. It lives no more than 600 meters above sea level. ==Home== This frog lives in forests on the Atlantic side (east side) of Brazil. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is 30.8 to 39.7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.3 to 44.1 mm long. Its chest and belly are yellow and its throat is orange. This frog is brown in color with darker brown marks. It has dark brown stripes on its inner legs, outer legs, and all of its front and back toes. Its back feet have more webbing than its front feet. The pupils of the frog's eye open up and down so that the slit goes left to right. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. The frog's upper front leg is thinner than its lower front leg, and its front feet are large for its body. It has disks on its toes for climbing. ==Voice== Scientists heard this frog make three kinds of sounds: When the male frog sings for the female frog, he sings one short note. When male frogs see each other, they make other kinds of sounds. A frog may make a short squeak if another male frog comes too close. He may squeak if a male frog tries to mate with him. A male frog may make a long noise if another male tries to push him off a female. ==Name== This frog is named after the Tropic√°lia, or Tropicalismo, music. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
