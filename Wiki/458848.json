The Swedish Royal Academies stated, when awarding the prize, that he \"has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory\". \"In a career that spanned seven decades, he transformed his field, influenced millions of students and turned MIT into an economics powerhouse\" Economic historian Randall E. Parker calls him the \"Father of Modern Economics\", and The New York Times thinks of him to be the \"foremost academic economist of the 20th century\". Samuelson died after a brief illness on December 13, 2009, at the age of 94. ==Reference== ==Other websites== * Biography at the Nobel e-Museum Category:1915 births Category:2009 deaths Category:American economists Category:American Nobel Prize winners Category:Jewish American academics Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Jewish Nobel Prize winners Category:People from Gary, Indiana Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty",
