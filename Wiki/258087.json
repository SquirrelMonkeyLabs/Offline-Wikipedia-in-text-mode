 "text": "Potassium chromate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is K2CrO4. It has potassium and chromate ions. ==Properties== It is a yellow crystalline solid. It is an oxidizing agent in an acidic condition. It is toxic though, because it contains chromium in its +6 oxidation state. It can be destroyed by reaction with reducing agents. It is very rarely found in the ground. It reacts with lead nitrate to make lead chromate, a yellow pigment. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting chromium trioxide with potassium hydroxide. It can also be made by oxidation of potassium hydroxide and chromium(III) oxide. ==Occurrence== Potassium chromate is found very rarely as a mineral. It dissolves easily in water. It is only found in very dry places. ==Uses== It is used to test for chloride ions. It can also be used to make lead chromate for paint. ==Safety== Potassium chromate is very toxic. It is a carcinogen. It reacts with reducing agents violently when in acid. ==Related pages== *Dichromate *Sodium chromate *Chromium(III) oxide Category:Potassium compounds Category:Chromium compounds",
