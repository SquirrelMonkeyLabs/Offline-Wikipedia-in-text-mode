Multiobject spectroscopy of young star clusters in NGC 4676. The Astrophysical Journal 660 (2): L105â€“L108. we see them as they began to collide and merge. Their name refers to the long tails produced by tidal action, which is the relative difference between gravitational pulls on the near and far parts of each galaxy. They are members of the Coma cluster, so the galaxies may have collided before, and will continue colliding until they merge.
