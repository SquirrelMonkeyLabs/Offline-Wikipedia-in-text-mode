The IRCTC was put up on 27 September 1999. It was originally and completely owned by the Government of India. It was operated under the administrative control of the Ministry of Railways. Later it has been listed on the National Stock Exchange since 2019, after the Government reduced the percentage of the ownership to the company itself. It began with online rail ticket booking through its website and also from the mobile phones through Wi-Fi, GPRS or SMS. It also provides SMS facility to send PNR status and Live Train Status to the passengers. Along with e-tickets, IRCTC also provides I-tickets that are basically like regular tickets.
