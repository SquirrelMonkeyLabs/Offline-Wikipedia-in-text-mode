 "text": "The voiced velar lateral stop is a type of fricative consonant sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents the sound is [ʟˀ]. This sound was used in the English or Spanish language; it has letters and numbers. The sound has transcribed 3 more sounds: ff, çß, and a˞. the letter [çß] needs a hook diacritic to represent the sound for the voiceless palatal fricative (ç). That sound was transcribed (ş). That sound represents the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative but (ş) is now a impossible sound. This symbol is called glottalized velar lateral approximant. == Voiceless velar lateral stop == Consonants == Related pages == *Voiceless dental fricative *Vowel *Consonant Category:Consonants",
