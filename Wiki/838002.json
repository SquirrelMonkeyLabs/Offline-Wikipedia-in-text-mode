Over the centuries, these dogs were loved by royalty, and were considered part of the royal family. The popularity of the Maltese grew steadily and gradually over the years, and they were finally introduced to America in the late 1800s.animalatoz.com The Standard Poodle can be traced back to France in the 15th century. These curly-haired dogs were so popular during that time that they became known as the national breed of France. Although it took almost three centuries, poodles began to gain popularity in other countries such as Spain. During the following century, the standard poodle was bred to the size we now label toy and miniature poodles. Although it is known that the Maltipoo is a new poodle mix, it is not very easy to find the exact place or year that this mixed breed was created. No single person or organization took credit for the first puppy of this new mix. == Colors == Many maltipoos are white, but you can find black, brown, and red maltipoos. == Environment == Maltipoos should be kept inside, they cannot be outside for too long.
