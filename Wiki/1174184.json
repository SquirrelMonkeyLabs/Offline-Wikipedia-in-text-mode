 "text": "Winners Merchants International L.P is a Canadian chain of department stores. They are headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario. They have 302 store locations all across Canada. In 1982, David Margolis opened the first Winners store in Toronto, Ontario. In 1990, Margolis decided to sell the company to U.S.-based TJX Companies who then merged it. On March 28, 2001, Winners decided to purchase the Labels brand from the bankrupt Dylex. In 2016, Winners got in trouble after a documentary revealed that the deals and prices they used in their \"compared at\" gimmick was possibly misleading. Winners said that this was not true and that their prices were accurate. They did say that sometimes things get messed up and when that happens, they try to correct the mistake. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1982 establishments in Canada Category:Companies based in Mississauga Category:Department stores of Canada Category:Discount stores of Canada",
