 "text": "Vaginal cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the vagina. Vaginal cancer is rare among the general population. Metastases are more common. It is important to be checked for it if anything is not normal. Vaginal cancer occurs more often in women over age 50 years old. It can occur at any age and even during pregnancy. It often can be cured if found and treated in its early stages. Surgery alone or surgery combined with pelvic radiation is typically used to treat vaginal cancer. There are two primary types of vaginal cancer: squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. == References == Category:Medicine Category:Cancer C C Category:Obstetrics and gynecology",
