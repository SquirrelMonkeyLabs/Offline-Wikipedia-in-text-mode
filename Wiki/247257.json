 "text": "Streptococcus mutans is a gram-positive bacteria that lives in the mouth, specifically on teeth. This bacteria grows optimally in the range of 18-40 degrees Celsius. First described by James Killian Clarke in 1924, the bacteria is the most common cause of tooth decay and cavities. ==Role in tooth decay== Along with Neisseria spp., various species of streptococci, including ``S. mutans``, and some fungi, form a biofilm known as dental plaque. S. mutans plays a major role in tooth decay, metabolizing sucrose into lactic acid. == References == category:Gram-positive bacteria",
