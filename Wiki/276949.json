It succeeded the Nintendo DS family. Like the Wii, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, and all the members of the Nintendo 3DS family, it has a Mii Maker application, letting the user create their own personal avatar, which some games use to replace the standard characters. It was released in Japan on February 26, 2011, on March 25, 2011 in Europe and the United Kingdom, on March 27, 2011 in the United States and Canada, and in Australia on March 31, 2011. The Nintendo 3DS lets the user play games in either 2D or 3D. A slider lets the player change the level of 3D in the game. The Nintendo 3DS also lets the user play most Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi games, but only in 2D. Similar to the DSi and DSi XL, DS games that use the Game Boy Advance slot cannot be used. It comes with extra channels (some have to be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop), such as Nintendo Video, Nintendo Zone, and Swapnote. The system has a camera on the inside, and two on the outside. The outer cameras let the user both take pictures in 3D and shoot videos up to 10 minutes long in 3D. The Nintendo 3DS was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010. On July 28, 2011, Nintendo announced that they would cut the price of the 3DS to $170 on August 12.
