 "text": "Andytown was a town in Broward County, Florida, United States. It is now a ghost town. It was located at the intersection of U.S. 27 and I-75 and was demolished in 1979 for the expansion of Alligator Alley. You can find Andytown in Google Maps as it includes a place marker for it. Andytown was very close to the Everglades, hence the reason Alligators used to occasionally appear in the town. The town had buildings like a motel and a gas station. Legendary Andy's Lounge and Package was a lounge honoring Andytown, and a lot of local people liked it! However it was demolished somewhere around 2015 by Cumberland Farms to make way for a Cumberland Farms super station.
