 "text": "The bleating tree frog (Litoria dentata) is a frog from Australia. It lives in New South Wales and Queensland. This frog lives in lagoons and swamps not far from the ocean and sometimes in forests. It has a very loud call similar to that of a cicada. This frog grows to about 4.5 cm in length from nose to rear end. It has a flatter body than most frogs. During the day, it hides under stones or pieces of treebark but sometimes in human-made objects. Human beings sometimes pick it up without knowing and move it from place to place while it is hiding in pipes or flowerpots. This frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The eggs float on top of the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly so they do not die when their homes dry up. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
