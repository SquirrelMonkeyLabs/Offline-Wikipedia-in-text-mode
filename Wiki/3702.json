 "text": "Memory is the personal record of past experiences. It is the brain's ability to store information to use later. Memory is studied in sciences known as \"cognitive psychology\". There are two types of memory: short-term and long- term memory, or known as working memory and reference memory. # Short-term memory, the ability to keep information in mind for a short time, like remembering a phone number long enough to find a piece of paper. # Long-term memory, the ability to remember things long after they happen, like remembering a holiday you had last year. The Greeks considered memory (Mnemosyne) as the mother of Muses, for without her there would be no art and science. ==Related pages== *Commemorative plaque *Memorial *Mnemonic *Performing music from memory *Photographic memory *Damnatio memoriae ==References== Category:Basic English 850 words Category:Human skills Category:Memory Category:Sources of knowledge",
