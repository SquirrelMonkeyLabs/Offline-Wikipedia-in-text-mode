 "text": "Pax Britannica, which means 'British Peace' in Latin (inspired by Pax Romana), refers to a time of the major world powers having mostly peaceful relations. During this era, the British Empire rose as the leading global superpower and took on the responsibility of being a 'global policeman'. From 1815 to 1914, a span known as Britain's 'Imperial Century', the British Empire expanded by adding around 26,000,000 square kilometers (10,000,000 square miles) of land and about 400 million people. After its victory over Napoleonic France, Britain faced no major challengers, except possibly Russia in Central Asia. The Royal Navy controlled most of the important routes for sea trade and enjoyed unchallenged sea power. Britain's powerful position in world trade meant that it essentially had a firm grip to the access of many regions, such as Asia, North America, Oceania and Africa. The British also helped the United States maintain the Monroe Doctrine, which not only helped maintain peace but also supported Britain's economic strength in the Americas. British merchants, shippers and bankers held a significant advantage over their counterparts from other empires. That advantage, formed an 'informal empire', which boosted Britain's global influence. ==References== Category:British Empire",
