 "text": "The Kingdom of Jerusalem, also called the Crusader Kingdom, was one of the Crusader states created as a result of the First Crusade, it was created by Godfrey of Bouillon. It was the longest standing crusader state in the Levant. The original kingdom stood from 1099 to 1187, before being taken by the Ayyubids for a short amount of time. The Kingdom was recreated in 1192 after the Third Crusade in Acre. The Capital of Jerusalem was moved from Jerusalem to Acre after the recreation of the kingdom, even though Jerusalem was partly controlled in the Sixth Crusade.Riley-Smith, The Crusades: A History, 2nd ed., pp. 180â€“182. Most of the Crusaders who ended up in Jerusalem, were mostly French, and spoke Old French. This led to the crusader states having a lingua franca. Most of the people in the Kingdom were native to the Levant, but many europeans also settled in the Kingdom. == References == Category:Crusades Category:History of Israel Category:History of the Middle East",
