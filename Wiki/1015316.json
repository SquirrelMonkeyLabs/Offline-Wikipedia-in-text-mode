 "text": "An evaporator is a device used to turn a liquid into a gas through evaporation. == Air conditioning and refrigeration == Air conditioners and refrigerators use a compressed liquid with a low boiling point that vaporizes inside the system and cools it, while releasing the thermal energy into its surroundings. The cooling liquid, or refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment (the evaporator coil) inside an air handler. Low pressure then causes the refrigerant to evaporate taking the heat with it. After this, it will continue back to the compressor. ==References== Category:Heat transfer Category:HVAC",
