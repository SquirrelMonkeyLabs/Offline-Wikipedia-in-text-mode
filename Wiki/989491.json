 "text": "The role of women in Christianity has varied since its founding. Women have played important roles in Christianity. This is especially in marriage, preaching positions for certain Christian denominations, and parachurch organizations. Many Christians believe that women and men are spiritually equal. But some preferred the patriarchy of the ancient world and said it also affected religion. In 2016, it was estimated that 52-53% of Christians are women (for people 20 and older). Women were mentioned in the Bible, despite the fact that it was interpreted as patriarchal, as it was written by men. The most notable women were Mary, mother of Jesus, Eve, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Bethany. ==References== Category:Christianity Category:Women",
