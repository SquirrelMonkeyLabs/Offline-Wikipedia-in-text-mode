The President's Guest House has been called \"the world's most exclusive hotel\" because it is used as a state guest house to host visiting dignitaries and other guests of the president. It is located just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Blair House is one of several residences owned by the United States government for use by the president and vice president of the United States. President Harry S. Truman and his family lived in the original Blair House from 1948 to 1952 during the White House Reconstruction. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Washington, D.C.",
