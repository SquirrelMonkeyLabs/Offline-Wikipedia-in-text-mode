 "text": "Warrior (born James Brian Hellwig; June 16, 1959 - April 8, 2014) was an American professional wrestler. Hellwig legally changed his name to Warrior in 2002. He was the biggest star of the 1990s. His career had a boost when he defeated Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI, and it was also Hulk Hogan's first Wrestlemania loss, firstly before defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania X8. Warrior died of a heart attack on the afternoon of April 8, 2014 at 54 years old, 3 days after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and less than a day after cutting a promo on Raw. Less than 24 hours before he died, Warrior gave a speech to the fans and wrestlers, past and present, in his Ultimate Warrior character. During the speech he said: > \"No WWE talent becomes a legend on their own. Every man's heart one day > beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final breath. And if what that > man did in his life makes the blood pulse through the body of others and > makes them believe deeper in something larger than life then his essence, > his spirit, will be immortalized. By the story tellers, by the loyalty, by > the memory of those who honor him and make the running the man did live > forever. You, you, you, you, you, you are the legend makers of Ultimate > Warrior. In the back I see many potential legends. Some of them with warrior > spirits. And you will do the same for them. You will decide if they lived > with the passion and intensity. So much so that you will tell your stories > and you will make them legends, as well. I am Ultimate Warrior. You are the > Ultimate Warrior fans. And the spirit of the Ultimate Warrior will run > forever!\" ==Early life== Warrior was born as James Brian Hellwig (though changed name to Hellshaw in 1969).
