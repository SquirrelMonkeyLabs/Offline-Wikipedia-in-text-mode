 "text": "The Battle of Roncevaux Pass was a confrontation that took place on August 15, 778, in the Pyrenees near the Roncevaux Pass (present-day border between France and Spain). The battle is famous for the death of Roland, the commander of the Frankish rearguard, which has been mythologized in the epic poem The Song of Roland. == Background == The battle occurred during Charlemagne's campaign into the Iberian Peninsula. Charlemagne had been invited by local Muslim leaders in al-Andalus to intervene against the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba. However, the campaign did not achieve its intended objectives, and Charlemagne’s army began a retreat back into Frankish territory. As the army moved through the narrow Roncevaux Pass in the Pyrenees, the Frankish rearguard, led by Roland, was ambushed by local Basque forces. == The battle == The Basques, using their knowledge of the terrain, launched a surprise attack on Charlemagne's rearguard. The narrow pass limited the Frankish soldiers' ability to maneuver and respond effectively. In the ensuing battle, the Franks suffered heavy casualties, and Roland was killed. The Basque forces succeeded in plundering the Frankish baggage train, and the ambush caused a significant setback for Charlemagne’s campaign. The Basque leaders who orchestrated the attack remain unknown. == Aftermath == The battle was a notable defeat for Charlemagne and became legendary in medieval European literature. Roland’s heroism was immortalized in The Song of Roland, which turned the historical battle into a symbol of Christian chivalry and valor against overwhelming odds. The defeat at Roncevaux Pass exposed the challenges of extended campaigns in foreign territories and the difficulties of controlling mountain passes. == Legacy == The Battle of Roncevaux Pass has had a lasting cultural impact, inspiring one of the oldest surviving major works of French literature, The Song of Roland. Roland's character became an icon of loyalty and bravery, and the battle was celebrated in songs and tales across medieval Europe. == Related pages == * Charlemagne * The Song of Roland * Basques * Pyrenees == References == == Other websites == * Battle of Roncevaux Pass at Encyclopædia Britannica Category:778 Roncevaux Pass",
