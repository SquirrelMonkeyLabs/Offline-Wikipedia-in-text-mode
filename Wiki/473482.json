 "text": "Self storage is a place where rooms or spaces are rented to individuals and companies. These can very large rooms or outside spaces, or as small as a simple locker. These spaces are usually rented on a short term lease, or on a month by month basis. A business may use self storage as a way to free up expensive office space to store company files, inventory, equipment, furniture and other items. The person or business leasing the space is responsible for placing items inside. The storage company does not usually have access to the spaces. The money spent on self storage in the USA was estimated to be $24 billion in 2013. ==References== Category:Business",
