 "text": "\"Bart the Murderer\" is the fourth episode of The Simpsons third season. It first started on the Fox network in the United States on October 10, 1991. In this episode, Bart stumbles upon the \"Mafia bar, Legitimate Businessman's Social Club\", after having a bad day at school. The owner of the bar, mobster \"Fat Tony\", hires Bart to work as its permanent bartender. When \"Principal Skinner\" goes missing after punishing Bart in school, Bart is quickly accused of killing him, resulting in his standing trial in court. As Bart is about to get convicted, Skinner shows up and says that he was accidentally stuck in his garage all week. Bart is therefore cleared of all the charges. == Other websites == * * * == References == Category:1991 television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 3) episodes",
