When he competed at the Polish Veterans Championships on June 28, 2015, in Torun he became the world's oldest athlete. On that day, Kowalski ran the 100 metres in 34.50, threw the shot put 4.27 and the discus 7.50. By competing in those events, he surpassed the accomplishments of John Whittemore, who competed at 104 years 10 months. M100 world record holder Hidekichi Miyazaki turned 105 on September 22, 2015 and two days later joined Kowalski as the second competitor in the division though Kowalski was 77 days older when he competed. Kowalski became the oldest living man in Poland after the death of 108 year old Józef Żurek on 20 March 2018. He became a supercentenarian on 14 April 2020. Kowalski died on April 5, 2022 in Świdnica, Poland nine days before his 112th birthday.Stanisław Kowalski nie żyje.
