 "text": "The Lara Andean collared frog (Mannophryne larandina) is a frog. It lives in Lara in Venezuela. ==Groups== Scientists think this might be the same frog species as Mannophryne yustizi, but they are not sure. ==Home== This frog lives in forests on mountains. Scientists saw the frog 1800 meters above sea level. There is one protected park near where the frog lives, Parque Nacional Dinira, but scientists did not see the frogs inside it. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Mannophryne do: The female frog lays eggs on land. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. It may be in danger from people changing the places where it lives to make farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
