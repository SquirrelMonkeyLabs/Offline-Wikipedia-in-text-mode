 "text": "Conker's Bad Fur Day is a platform game for the Nintendo 64 that was developed and published by Rare and distributed by Nintendo in 2001. It is the sequel to the Game Boy Color game, Conker's Pocket Tales. This game was in development for four years and was originally going to be entitled Conker's Quest, and then Twelve Tails: Conker 64. This game was going to be rated E until Rare changed it to a mature game, due to thinking they would be mocked as people call it a cutesy game. After the change, Conker was not a cutesy character anymore, drinks too much beer, and becomes a greedy squirrel. This game later received a remake for the Xbox in 2005 known as Conker: Live & Reloaded. ==Reception== *IGN: 9.9/10 *GameSpot: 9.3/10 *Game Revolution: B+ *GameRankings: 89% *Metacritic: 92% == Other websites == * Conker's Bad Fur Day on Mobygames.com Category:2001 video games Category:3D platformers Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Rare (company) games Category:THQ games Category:Video games about animals Category:Video games about dinosaurs Category:Xbox One games",
