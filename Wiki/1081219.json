 "text": "Operation Sunrise was a series of meeting mostly taken place in the city of Berne, Switzerland. American Generals and Nazi German Officials discussed terms of surrender there, as World War 2 was ending. Significant contributers in the meetings were General Karl Wolff, and Agent Allen Dulles. But as the Cold War was dawning, and began in the Yalta Conference in February 4th to 11th, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin grew suspiscious of the Americans. They could not allow their rival superpower to take things by themselves. Tensions rapidly increased between the two powers. Problems were also increasing in war-torn Italy. But because Americans hated to make further more tensions with Europe, it agreed with the Soviet Union to have a Bolshevik General too, in operations, discussions, and national terms, so stopped the meetings in Switzerland, and discussed terms of surrender in Northern Italy, this time with a Soviet General with them.
