 "text": "A Beretta 92 is a pistol produced by Italian company Beretta. == Description == Beretta 92 fires 9x19mm cartridges and it can hold 15 of them. It is the standard side-arm of many police and military units and the United States Army. In the US Army, the pistol got the name M9. After the US military ended its ban on foreign-made weapons, its allies in NATO pressured the US to adopt a 9mm handgun to replace the M1911 because NATO has a rule that all NATO countries must use weapons with the same kinds of ammunition. == References == == Other websites == * Official website of Beretta Category:Pistols Category:Law enforcement equipment",
