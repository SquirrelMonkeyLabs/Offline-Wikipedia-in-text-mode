It is the homeground of RB Leipzig. ==History== The Zentralstadion was built between 1954 and 1956. 100,000 visitors could enter the stadium. It was used for the sport festivals of the GDR, GDR football team matches, and other sports. The largest number of visitors was during a football match between SC Wismut Karl- Marx-Stadt and FC Kaiserslautern when 110,000 people entered. It was renovated between 2000 and 2004. The renovation reduced the number of visitors that can enter the stadium. The first match in the new stadium was FC Sachsen Leipzig – Borussia Dortmund (Amateure) in front of 28,000 visitors. Now it is only used for football matches and concerts. In 2010, Red Bull bought the right to name the stadium for 30 years. It is now called \"Red Bull Arena\" and became the homeground of RB Leipzig, which is owned by Red Bull. ==2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup 2006== The stadium was venue for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup 2006. ===Confederation Cup 2005=== *Australia-Tunesia 44,337 visitors *Brazil - Greece 42,507 visitors ===World Cup 2006=== Date Time (CEST) Team #1 Result Team #2 Round Attendance 11 June 2006 15:00 Serbia and Montenegro 0–1 Netherlands Group C 37,216 14 June 2006 15:00 Spain 4–0 Ukraine Group H 43,000 18 June 2006 21:00 France 1–1 Korea Republic Group G 43,000 21 June 2006 16:00 Iran 1–1 Angola Group D 38,000 24 June 2006 21:00 Argentina 2–1 (AET) Mexico Round of 16 43,000 ==Other websites== * erlebnis- stadion.de: History and renovation (German) * wm-2006-leipzig.de: Pictures * zentralstadion-le.de: Pictures Category:Football stadiums in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Leipzig Category:Sport in Saxony Category:1956 establishments",
