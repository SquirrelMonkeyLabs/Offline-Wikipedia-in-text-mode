 "text": "Tughlaqabad Fort is a ruined (collapsed or broken) fort in Delhi. It was built by Ghiyasuddin-Tughlaq in 1321. He was the founder of Tughlaq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate of India. Ghiyasuddin built the third historic city of Delhi, the Tughlaqabad. This fort was built in Tughlaqabad. This city was later abandoned (left) in 1327. ==History== In 1321, Ghazi Malik drove away the Khilji ruler Khusrau Khan and became the ruler. He assumed (got) the title of Ghias-ud-din Tughlaq. He started the Tughlaq dynasty.He immediately started the construction of his Tughlaqabad city. === The Curse of Nizamuddin Auliya === Ghiyasuddin was a liberal (free and soft) ruler. However, he was eager (passionate) about his city, Tughlaqabad. He wanted all his labourers in Delhi to work on his fort. Saint Nizamuddin Auliya, a Sufi saint got angry with the king's decision. This was because his well was under construction. The fight between the saint and the king became huge. The saint gave a curse for the fort. It was translated as \"it won't be inhabited (occupied), if occupied, it will be by a nomad tribe known as gujjars (cattle shepherding group)\". After the fall of the Delhi sultanate, Gujjars of the area captured the Fort. ==Death of Ghiyasuddin== Another curse of the saint was ‘Hunuz Dilli dur ast’ (Delhi is still far away). Emperor Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq succeeded in his Bengal attack. On his way to Delhi, he was crushed to death by the collapse of a tent. The tent was prepared by his son Muhammad bin Tughlaq. == Gallery == File:Ruined fort of Tughlaqabad.jpg|A view of ruined fort of Tughlaqabad during sunset File:Tughlaqabad massive fort wall.jpg|Tughlaqabad massive fort wall File:South gate entry to Tughlaqbad fort.jpg|South gate entry to Tughlaqbad fort File:Entrance of the Mausoleum of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq.jpg|Entrance of the Mausoleum of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq File:Tughlaq Tomb.jpg|Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and his son Muhammad Bin Tughlaq File:Well inside Tughlaqabad.jpg|A Well inside Tughlaqabad Fort ==Reference== Category:Tughlaq dynasty Category:14th-century buildings and structures",
