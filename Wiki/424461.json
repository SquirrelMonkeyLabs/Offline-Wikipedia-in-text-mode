 "text": "Ecgfrith (died 796) was the King of Mercia from July to December 796. He was the son of Offa, the King of Mercia, and Cynethryth. In 787 he was crowned King of Mercia while his father still ruled. This is the first known consecration of an English king. No doubt it was Offs's imitation of the consecration of Charlemagne's sons by the pope in 781. It was a practical way to recognize Ecgfrith as heir to the Mercian kingdom. Offa continued to rule and maintained all the power himself.Mike Ashley, The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (New york: Carroll & Graf, 1999), p. 259 Ecgfrith was succeeded as king by Coenwulf. This was probably because Offa had arranged the murder of nearer relatives in order to eliminate any rivals to Ecgfrith. Alcuin of York, an English deacon and scholar wrote:Lapidge, \"Alcuin of York\", in Lapidge et al., \"Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England\", p. 24. ::Alcuin added: \"This was not a strengthening of the kingdom, but its ruin.\"Letter of Alcuin to Mercian ealdorman Osbert, tr. in Whitelock, English Historical Documents, p. 787 When his father died in July of 796 Ecgfrith was king for only 141 days. The cause of his death is unknown but may not have been natural. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:796 deaths Category:Unexplained deaths Category:Kings and Queens of Mercia",
