 "text": "The green poison frog (Andinobates viridis) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== This frog lives in the dead leaves on the ground in forests that have never been cut down and some forests that have been cut down and are growing back. It lives on hills and mountains. Scientists do not know where it lays eggs or where the tadpoles swim. People have seen this frog between 100 and 1350 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles on their backs. They take the tadpoles to water in bromeliad plants. The tadpoles swim and grow in the water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Many of them disappeared in the 1990s. Scientists know the fungal disease chytridiomycosis killed other animals near where the frog lives, but they do not know if it killed these frogs. Human beings change the places where the frog used to live to make farms and dig things out of the ground. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Farallones National Park ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
