It is voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. ==Fictional biography== The Gravemind is the one of the main antagonists of the Halo franchise, serving as the unseen overarching antagonist of Halo: Combat Evolved, one of the two main antagonists (alongside the Prophet of Truth) of the original trilogy and a posthumous antagonist in the Reclaimer Saga. The Gravemind encountered both Master Chief and the Arbiter. It gave them an offer to defeat the Covenant Loyalists. It is a parasitic hive-mind intelligence and the leader of The Flood. It is a collection of the sentience and knowledge that has been gathered by the victims of the Flood. It would attempt to assimilate all sentient life in the galaxy and turn everything into the Flood.In the end, the Gravemind was destroyed as Halo's activation destroyed itself and the Flood that had escaped containment. ==Development== For it's first appearance, there was supposed to be a full level about him but was replaced with an opening cutscene. ==Reception== Many people didn't like Gravemind's first design. By the remake for Halo 2, his design was heavily improved and got better reception. Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2004 Category:Halo characters Category:Video game antagonists",
