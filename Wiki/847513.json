 "text": "General elections were held in Peru with the first round on 11 April 2021 and a run-off on 6 June 2021. The presidential election determined the President and the Vice Presidents. On 11 June, 100% of the votes were processed and counted, with Castillo defeating Fujimori by a near 60,000 vote margin. ==Background== Eighteen candidates participated in the presidential election, the highest number of candidates since the 2006 Peruvian general election. Pedro Castillo, a member of the left-wing Free Peru party, received the most votes in the first round. He will face Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the right-wing Popular Force, who had narrowly lost the run-offs of the 2011 and the 2016 elections. If Fujimori were to win, she would be Peru's first female president, the second of East Asian descent, after her father, Alberto Fujimori and the continuation of the Conservative wave election victories in South America. ===Date=== Then-President Martín Vizcarra originally supported legislation that would set the terms for a snap election in 2020. If successful, Vizcarra would not have been eligible for re-election. The 2020 proposed Peruvian general election would have been held on 11 April 2020, to elect a new President of the Republic of Peru, along with 130 congressmen of the Congress of Peru. It was eventually decided to be held on 26 January 2020. Opposition lawmakers condemned Vizcarra's proposal, defending the practice of five year terms. This constitutional reform was rejected. ===San Miguel del Ene attack=== On 23 May, just two weeks before the election run-off, 18 people were killed by a militant communist group as protest against the election and Fujimori's candidacy. ==Candidates== The candidates below are listed based on their performance from the first and second round of the election: File:Mensaje a la Nación - Pedro Castillo (cropped).png|Teacher Pedro Castillo (Free Peru) File:Keiko Fujimori 2 (cropped).jpg|Former Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori (Popular Force) File:Rafael López Aliaga.jpg|Former Councilman Rafael López Aliaga (Popular Renewal) File:MINISTRO VALAKIVI SE REUNIÓ CON ECONOMISTA HERNANDO DE SOTO (20681376492) (cropped).jpg|Economist Hernando de Soto Polar (Go on Country) File:Yonhy Lescano 2012 (cropped).jpg|Former Congressman Yonhy Lescano (Popular Action) File:Verónika Mendoza Frisch.jpg|Former Congresswoman Verónika Mendoza (Together for Peru) |Former Governor César Acuña (Alliance for Progress) File:George Forsyth Sommer.jpg|Former Mayor George Forsyth (National Victory) File:Daniel Urresti.jpg|Congressman Daniel Urresti (Podemos Perú) File:Julio Guzmán en La Encerrona (cropped).png|Former Secretary-General Julio Guzmán (Purple Party) File:Alberto Beingolea.jpg|Former Congressman Alberto Beingolea (Christian People's Party) File:Daniel E.
