Many protest songs have lyrics that directly call for change, while others use humor, irony, or the ballad form to make their point. Protest songs can come from just about any type of music. In the 1960s in the United States, many folk musicians such as Phil Ochs, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan made protest songs. Some of these songs were against fighting of the United States in the Vietnam War. ==References== song Category:Political songs",
