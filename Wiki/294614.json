 "text": "Hintlesham is a village and civil parish on the A1071 road in Babergh, Suffolk, England. In 2001, there were 564 people living in Hintlesham. ==The church== The stairway to the roodloft in the south wall is one of the best preserved in the county. For about 350 years Hintlesham has been a joint parish with Chattisham whose church, St Margaret's, stands about a mile away, separated by a valley of meadows and woods. ==Hintlesham Hall== In August 1720 the hall was bought by Richard Powys, a Principal Clerk to The Treasury, and the Powys family lived there for nearly 30 years, after which it was sold to the lawyer Richard Lloyd, a future solicitor-general, and passed down through his descendants until the early 1900s. In 1972 the hall was bought by chef Robert Carrier for Â£32,000 () and was restored. The business was later owned by the hotelier and broadcaster Ruth Watson and her husband. Today the hall is operated as a country-house hotel. == References == Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Settlements in Babergh",
