 "text": "The Turin King List, also called the Turin Royal Canon, is a list of the kings of Egypt. It was written in Egyptian hieratic script on papyrus. It is thought to date from the rule of Pharaoh Ramesses II. The list is now in the Egyptian Museum in Turin. The papyrus is the most complete list of kings written by the Egyptians. It is the basis working out the dates of kings before the rule of Ramesses II. ==Creation and use== The papyrus is believed to have been written in the time of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. The beginning and ending of the list are lost. There is no introduction, and the list stops after the 19th Dynasty. It may have been written at any later time, from Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty. The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of their rule in years, with months and days for some kings. In some cases they are grouped together by family. This grouping is almost the same as the dynasties of Manetho’s book. The list includes the names of kings who only ruled for a very short time, or those ruling small areas that may not be in listed in other sources. The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (borders around the name of a king). They do have a hieroglyphic sign to show that they were foreigners. The papyrus was a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt. It includes the mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. As the papyrus was reused for the tax roll, it shows the list was not of great formal importance to the writer. The list is thought to have been used as an administrative aid. As such, the papyrus is not supposed to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt up through at least the 19th Dynasty. ==Discovery and reconstruction== The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes). In 1824 was put in the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, and known as Papyrus Number 1874. When the box in which it had been taken to Italy was unpacked, the list had broken up into small pieces. Jean-Francois Champollion could read only some of the larger pieces which had royal names. The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796–1885) looked carefully at some of the pieces, some only one square centimeter in size. He made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not read the hieratic characters. Later work by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, largely agreed with Seyffarth's work. In 1997 Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new version of the list in his book, \"The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C.\" Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that many of the list’s names match historic monuments and other documents. However there are some differences and not all of the names match. The list may not be completely accurate for pre- Ramesses II chronology. About 50% of the papyrus is missing. It is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 pieces. In 2009 new pieces were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. wayback machine: (in Italian) A new edition of the papyrus is expected. The name Hudjefa, is listed twice in the papyrus. The name is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of Ramesses II when the name of a king was unreadable or missing. ==Contents of the papyrus== The papyrus is divided into eleven columns. The names and positions of several kings are still uncertain as the list is so badly damaged. *Column 1 — Gods of Ancient Egypt *Column 2 — Rows 1-10 Spirits and mythical kings *Column 2 — Rows 11-25 (Dynasties 1-2) *Column 3 — Rows 1-25 (Dynasties 2-5) *Column 4 — Rows 1-26 (Dynasties 6-8/9/10) *Column 5 — Rows 12-25 (Dynasties 11-12) *Column 6 — Rows 1-2 (Dynasties 12-13) *Column 7 — Rows 1-23 (Dynasty 13) *Column 8 — Rows 1-27 (Dynasty 13-14) *Column 9 — Rows 1-30 (Dynasty 14) *Column 10 — Rows 1-30 (Dynasties 14-15) *Column 11 — Rows 1-17 (Dynasties 16-17) This is the list of kings ===Second column=== Second Column Row Common name 11 Menes 12 Hor-Aha 13 Djer 15 Djet 16 Den 17 Anedjib 18 Semerkhet 19 Qa'a 20 Hotepsekhemwy 21 Nebre 22 Nynetjer 23 Wadjnes 24 Senedj 25 Neferkara I ===Third column=== Third Column Row Common name 2 Neferkasokar 3 Khasekhemwy 4 Sanakhte 5 Djoser 6 Sekhemkhet 7 Hudjefa II 8 Huni 9 Sneferu 10 Khufu 11 Djedefre 12 Khafre 13 Lost 14 Menkaure 15 Shepseskaf 16 Unknown 17 Userkaf 18 Sahure 19 Neferirkare Kakai 20 Shepseskare 21 Neferefre 22 Nyuserre 23 Menkauhor 24 Djedkare 25 Unas ===Fourth Column=== Fourth Column Row Common name 1 Teti 2 Userkare 3 Pepi 4 Merenre Nemtyemsaf I 5 Pepi II 6 Merenre Nemtyemsaf II 7 Neitiqerty Siptah 8 Lacuna 9 Menkare 10 Neferkare II 11 Ibi 12 Lost 13 Lost 18 Lost 19 Lost 20 Neferkare III 21 Nebkaure Khety 22 Senenh.. 23 Lost 24 Mer.. 25 Shed.. 26 H.. ===Fifth Column=== Fifth Column Row Common name 1 Lost 2 Lost 3 Lost 4 Lost 5 Lost 6 Lost 7 Lost 8 Lost 9 Lost ' 12 Mentuhotep I 13 Intef I 14 Intef II 15 Intef III 16 Mentuhotep II 17 Mentuhotep III 20 Amenemhat I 21 Sesostris I 22 Amenemhat II 23 Sesostris II 24 Sesostris III 25 Amenemhat III ===Sixth Column=== Sixth Column Row Common name 1 Amenemhet IV 2 Sobekneferu 5 Wegaf or Sobekhotep I 6 Sekhemkare Sonbef 7 Sekhemkare Amenemhat V 8 Hotepibre 9 Iufni 10 Amenemhet VI 11 Semenkare Nebnuni 12 Sehetepibre 13 Sewadjkare 14 Nedjemibre 15 Khaankhre Sobekhotep 16 Renseneb 17 Awybre Hor I 18 Amenemhat VII 19 Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep 20 Khendjer 21 Imyremeshaw 22 Intef IV 23 Seth Meribre 24 Sobekhotep III 25 Neferhotep I 26 Sihathor 27 Sobekhotep IV ===Seventh Column=== Seventh Column Row Common name 1 Sobekhotep V 2 Wahibre Ibiau 3 Merneferre Ay 4 Merhotepre Ini 5 Sankhenre Sewadjtu 6 7 Hori 8 Merkawre Sobekhotep 9 Lost 10 Lost 11 Lost 12 Lost 13 Djedneferre Dedumose 14 Ibi 15 Hor 16 Se..kare 17 Seheqenre Sankhptahi 18 Lost 19 Lost 20 Sekhaenre 21 Lost 22 Merkheperre 23 Merkare ===Eighth Colunm=== Eighth Column Row Common name 1 Nehesy 2 Khatyre 3 Nebfautre 4 Sehebre 5 Merdjefare 6 Sewadjkare III 7 Nebdjefare 8 Webenre 9 Lost 10 ..re 11 ..webenre 12 Autibre 13 Heribre 14 Renebsen 15 Lost 16 Sekheperenre 17 Djedkherure 18 Seankhibre 19 Kanefertemre 20 Sekhem..re 21 Kakemure 22 Neferibre 23 I..re 24 Kha..re 25 Aakare 26 Semen..re 27 Djed..re ===Ninth Column=== Ninth Column Row Common name 1 Lost 2 Lost 3 Lost 4 Lost 5 Lost 6 Lost 7 Senefer..re 8 Men..re 9 Djed.. 10 Lost 11 Lost 12 Lost 13 Lost 14 Inenek 15 Ineb 16 'Apepi 17 Hab 18 Sa 19 Hepu 20 Shemsu 21 Meni 22 Werqa.. 23 Lost 24 Lost 25 ..ka 26 ..ka 27 Lost 28 ..ren..hepu 29 Anati 30 Bebnum 31 Lost ===Tenth Column=== Tenth Column Row Common name 1 I.. 2 Seth II 3 Sunu.. 4 Hor.. 5 Lost 6 Lost 7 Nib.. 8 Mer..en.. 9 Penensetensepet 10 Kherethebshepesu 11 Khut..hemet 12 Lost 15 Semqen? 16 Aperanat? 17 Sakir-Har 18 Khyan 19 Apepi 20 Khamudi 23 Lost 24 Lost 25 Zeket.. 26 Ar.. 27 Lost 28 Lost 29 ..nia.. ===Eleventh Column=== Eleventh Column Row Common name 1 Sekhemre Sementawy Djehuti 2 Sekhemre Susertawi Sobekhotep VIII 3 Sekhemre Sankhtawy Neferhotep III 4 Sewadjenre Nebiryraw I 5 Nebiriaure 6 Nebiretaure 7 Semenre 8 Seuserenre Bebiankh 9 Sekhemre Shedwaset 10 Lost 11 Lost 12 Lost 13 Lost 14 Lost 16 User..re 17 User.. ==Related pages== *List of pharaohs * Abydos King List * Karnak king list *Palermo Stone (An older fragmented king list) ==References== ==Bibliography== *Alan Gardiner, editor.
