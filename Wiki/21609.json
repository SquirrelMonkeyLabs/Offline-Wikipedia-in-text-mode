When Europeans first arrived in the 16th century, the Cherokee lived in the modern-day eastern and southeastern United States. However, the United States government forced most to move to the Ozark Hills. The Cherokee were named one of \"Five Civilized Tribes.\" == History == Cherokee people did not live in tepees. They lived in houses made from wood. In the 19th century, a man named Sequoyah introduced a form of writing the Cherokee language. For this, he was awarded a medal.The Cherokee tribe had two chiefs, a red and white chief. When the tribe was at war, the red chief would lead, and when there was peace within the tribe, the white chief would lead. Chief John Ross was the leader of the Cherokee tribe from 1818 until 1867. He lived in Georgia before being forced to move to the place now called Oklahoma. == Tribes today == The U.S. government officially recognizes three Cherokee tribes:Indians.org # Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. # United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma. # Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina. ==References== Category:Native Americans",
