It lives on the eastern side of the Andes mountains. The adult male frog is 31.5â€“35.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 34.9 mm long. The skin on its back is green. The skin on its belly is white. This frog moves at night. It lives in rainy forests and cloud forests on mountains. Scientists think this frog lays eggs in streams because other frogs in Hyloscritus lay eggs in streams. The scientific name of this frog comes from Latin for \"lives in fast-moving water.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
