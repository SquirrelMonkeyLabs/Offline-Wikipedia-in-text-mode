 "text": "Set-builder notation is a mathematical notation used in set theory, logic, mathematics, and computer science to describe a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. Defining sets by properties is also known as set comprehension, set abstraction, or defining a set's intension. == Structure == In set-builder notation, a set is typically written in one of the following forms: * or * Where: * x is a variable representing an element of the set. * The vertical bar \"∣\" (or sometimes a colon \":\") is interpreted as \"such that\" or \"for which.\" * Φ(x) is a predicate (a logical formula) that must be satisfied by the elements of the set. == Use in Predicate Logic == Set-builder notation is heavily used in predicate logic to define sets based on conditions. If the predicate (the condition) is true for a particular element, that element belongs to the set. == Empty Sets == If no values satisfy the condition specified in set-builder notation, the set will be the empty set, denoted by or . == See also == * Set (mathematics) * Set theory * Predicate logic * Naive set theory * List of mathematical symbols == References == Category:Mathematical notation",
