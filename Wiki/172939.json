 "text": "Albania national football team is the national football team of Albania. Although it never played any matches, the Albanian national football team existed before FSHF was created. This is witnessed by the registration of the team in the Balkan Cup tournament of 1929-1931, which started in 1929 (although Albania eventually retired from the competition, before the competition started).[4] FSHF was founded on June 6, 1930, and Albania had to wait 16 years to play its first international match, debuting against Yugoslavia in 1946. In 1932, Albania joined FIFA (during the congress June 12 â€” June 16) and in 1954, it was one of the founding members of UEFA. ==Most appearances== Pos Player Apps Goals Career 1 Foto Strakosha 73 0 1990-2005 2 Altin Lala 70 3 1998-present 3 Igli Tare 68 10 1997-2007 4 Alban Bushi 67 14 1995-2007 5 Altin Haxhi 65 3 1995-2007 6 Altin Rraklli 63 11 1992-2005 7 Rudi Vata 59 5 1990-2001 8 Ervin Skela 53 9 2000-present 9 Klodian Duro 50 3 2000-present 10 Arjan Xhumba 48 0 1992-2002 ==Top scorers== Pos Player Goals Apps Career 6 Erjon Bogdani 19 79 1996-present 1 Alban Bushi 14 67 1995-2007 2 Altin Rraklli 11 63 1992-2005 3 Igli Tare 10 68 1997-2007 4 Sokol Kushta 10 1987-1996 5 Ervin Skela 9 53 2000-2011 6 Adrian Aliaj 8 2002-2006 8 Loro Borici 6 1946-1958 9 Bledar Kola 6 1994-2001 9 Edmond Kapllani 6 2004-present ==References== Category:European national football teams National football team Category:Organizations based in Albania",
