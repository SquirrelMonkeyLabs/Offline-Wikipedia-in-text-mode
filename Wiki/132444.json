 "text": "Victor J. Hammer (November 1, 1901 – July 21, 1985) was a businessman, founder and owner of the Hammer Galleries in New York City. He was the younger brother of Armand Hammer. Victor attended Princeton University, where he graduated in 1921 with a degree in Art History. Victor was business partner to his brother Armand Hammer on several business ventures, including Hammer Galleries in New York City, founded in 1928 as a way to funnel profits made in Soviet Russia out of that country. At one point, British Intelligence believed Hammer Galleries was a front for Soviet Intelligence. The Hammer brothers had been in contact with Soviet authorities for a number of reasons, such as famine relief as well as when the Soviets sought a buyer for the treasures of the Hermitage as a way to earn hard currency. Victor was responsible for acquisitions for Hammer Galleries, including the so-called Romanov Treasures and Fabergé eggs. In 1937, Time Magazine described Victor and Armand as \"Two of the most startling characters in the U. S. art world are the Brothers Armand and Victor Hammer, one with a medical degree, both friends of Soviet Russia.\". Victor Hammer was a prolific philanthropist. He, along with his brothers Harry and Armand, purchased Campobello Island and donated it to the US and Canada as the countries' first joint park, known as Roosevelt Campobello International Park ==References== ==Other websites== * Hammer Galleries, New York City Category:1901 births Category:1985 deaths Category:People from New York City Category:Philanthropists from New York (state)",
