 "text": "In anatomy, the dorsal is the upper side of animals that can run, fly, or swim in a forwards and backwards direction, and the back side of animals (like humans) that walk upright. In vertebrates the dorsum contains the backbone. The term dorsal means the parts that are either located toward or grow off that side of an animal. The opposite side of the animal is described with the terms ventrum and ventral. In humans, the top of the foot is the dorsal part. Examples of the use of \"dorsal\" are the dorsal fins of fish.
