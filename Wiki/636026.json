 "text": "Caelus or Coelus was a god of the sky in Roman myth and theology and literature. Its name usually appears in masculine form when he is thought of as a male generative force. According to Cicero and Hyginus, Caelus was the son of Aether and Dies (\"Day\" or \"Daylight\").Cicero, De natura deorum 3.44, as cited by E.J. Kenney, Apuleius: Cupid and Psyche (Cambridge University Press, 1990, 2001), note to 6.6.4, p. 198; Hyginus, preface. This is not the theogony that Hesiod presents. Caelus and Dies were in this tradition the parents of Mercury.Cicero, De natura Deorum 3.56; also Arnobius, Adversus Nationes 4.14. ==References== Category:Greek gods and goddesses",
