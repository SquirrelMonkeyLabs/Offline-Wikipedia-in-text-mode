 "text": "Hector Samuel Juan \"Tico\" Torres (born October 7, 1953) is an American musician, artist, and entrepreneur, best known as the drummer, percussionist, and songwriter for American rock band Bon Jovi. In 2018, Torres was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bon Jovi. == Personal life == Torres and his first wife divorced soon after the formation of Bon Jovi in 1983. In 1996, Torres married Czech-born model Eva Herzigov√° in Sea Bright, New Jersey. The ceremony was attended by their closest friends and family including Donald Trump and the members of Bon Jovi. The band serenaded Eva and her husband with the hit single \"Always\" during the dance. Their marriage ended two years later. Torres married Maria Alejandra in September 2001, his third marriage. They have a son, Hector Alexander, born on January 9, 2004. Torres is an avid golfer who frequently participates in the Alfred Dunhill Links Pro-Am in St. Andrews, UK, often playing in a foursome with fellow musician and good friend Huey Lewis. === Endorsements === After a long endorsement deal with Pearl drums and hardware since 1984, after Richie Sambora's last show with Bon Jovi in April 2013, Torres changed from Pearl drums to DW, after DW made a custom kit out of cherry wood to Torres' specifications. Along with DW, Torres also endorses Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads, his signature Easton Ahead drumsticks and their griptape and gloves, LP percussion and Beato drum bags. Torres used DW pedals for most of his career but not hardware or drums until 2013. == References == Category:1953 births Category:American painters Category:American rock drummers Category:American rock musicians Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Category:Bon Jovi members",
