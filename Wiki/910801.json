 "text": "A thermobaric weapon, aerosol bomb, fuel air explosive, or vacuum bomb is a type of explosive that uses oxygen from the surrounding air to create a high- temperature explosion. This can be launched as a rocket or dropped from an airplane as a bomb. ==Effects== In 2000, Human Rights Watch quoted United States authorities, on how the blast's \"kill mechanism against living [things or] targets is unique—and unpleasant.... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent [vacuum or] rarefaction, which ruptures the lungs.... If the fuel [burns or] deflagrates but does not [... explode], victims will be severely burned and will probably also [... breathe] the burning fuel. [... The] most common FAE fuels [or fuel-air explosion fuels], ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic\"; Breathing unexploded FAE adds to the risk of (related) death. ==Weapons and warheads== *TOS-1 (ТОС-1),https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/WjP0ok/meter-for-meter-kommer- russerne-naermere-slik-utkjempes-slaget-i-donbas.
