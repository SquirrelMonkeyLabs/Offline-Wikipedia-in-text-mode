 "text": "Augustinianism is a set of Christian beliefs and ideas developed by Saint Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD). His teachings have greatly influenced Western Christianity and philosophy. Later thinkers like Boethius, Anselm of Canterbury, and Bonaventure further developed his ideas. == View of humanity == Augustine believed that all humans are connected and share responsibility for sin. He taught that because of original sin—the first sin by Adam and Eve—all people inherit sinfulness and are subject to God's judgment. Despite this, Augustine saw value in the world and human life, emphasizing that everything created by God has meaning and purpose. == Ethics == Augustine's ethical teachings focus on the importance of loving God above all else. He believed that by loving God, people can properly love others and live a moral life. He emphasized virtues such as humility, community, friendship, and the pursuit of wisdom. == Epistemology (theory of knowledge) == Augustine taught that humans need divine illumination to truly understand truth. This means that God enlightens the human mind, allowing people to grasp deeper truths that they couldn't understand on their own. However, later thinkers like Thomas Aquinas argued that human reason and senses are sufficient for understanding the world. == Anthropology (study of humans) == === Soul === Augustine believed that humans are a unity of body and soul. He compared this unity to a marriage, where both parts are essential. While influenced by Plato's idea of the soul being more important, Augustine emphasized that the body is also a vital part of human nature. === Original sin === According to Augustine, original sin is passed down from Adam and Eve through human reproduction. This inherited sin weakens human will but doesn't destroy it. He introduced the idea that even infants need baptism to cleanse them from this original sin. This view was in contrast to Pelagianism, which held that humans are born without sin and can choose good without divine help. === Theodicy and free will === Augustine addressed the problem of evil by teaching that evil is not a substance but a lack of good. He believed that God created everything good, and evil entered the world through the misuse of human free will. Even though humans have free will, they often choose wrongly, leading to suffering and evil. However, free will is necessary for genuine love and moral choices. == Influence == Augustinianism has had a lasting impact on Christian theology and Western thought. It influenced various religious orders, such as the Augustinians, who follow the Rule of Saint Augustine. His ideas also played a role in debates about grace, free will, and salvation, shaping discussions for centuries.
