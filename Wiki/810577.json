The MPLA fought alongside these parties for independence from Portuguese colonialism. Angolan Civil War From 1975–2002, the Angolan Civil War took place. The MPLA has been considered the ruling party of Angola since its victory of the Portuguese Colonial War. The war was started by the struggle for power amongst parties, where UNITA waged war with the MPLA, eventually resulting in Jonas Savimbi's death in 2002. This reduced the power of UNITA, leading to the signing of a peace treaty. ==Foreign support== During both the Portuguese Colonial War and the Angolan Civil War, the MPLA received military, political and humanitarian support primarily from the governments of Algeria, Bulgaria East Germany, Cape Verde, Czechoslovak, the Congo, Cuba, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, North Korea, Polish People's Republic, China, Romania, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, Soviet Union, Sudan, Tanzania, Libya and SFR Yugoslavia. While China did briefly support the MPLA, China also actively supported UNITA and Jonas Savimbi after Sino-Soviet split. == References == Category:20th-century establishments in Angola Category:1956 establishments in Africa Category:Communist parties Category:National liberation movements Category:Political parties in Angola Category:Social democratic parties Category:Socialist International",
