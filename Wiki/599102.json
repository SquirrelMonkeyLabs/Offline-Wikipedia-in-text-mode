In 2022, the party had 1,602,361 members, being the second largest political party in Brazil, only behind the Brazilian Democratic Movement. Along with the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), its historical opponent, PT was the largest party that emerged from the fight for democratization of Brazil during the military dictatorship. Historically democratic socialist, since the 2000s the party follows social-democratic principles and maintains a populist stance centered on Lula's image (something called \"Lulism\").Oliveira, Merilyn Escobar de (2008).

Its support mainly comes from lower-class workers, civil servants, Catholics, and artists. Its members and sympathizers are colloquially called \"petistas\". In 2003, with Lula becoming President, the party began to command the Brazilian Executive for the first time. Lula was re-elected in 2006, finishing his term as the best approved President of all time, with a world record of 87% approval. He was succeeded by Dilma Rousseff in 2011. Dilma was re-elected in 2014 by a narrow margin despite the party's unpopularity caused by an economic crises and corruption scandals. She left the presidency in August 2016, after a request for impeachment was approved by the National Congress due to budget operations not foreseen in legislation during her administration. In 2022, Lula was elected to a third term, becoming the first Brazilian President to win an election three times. == History overview == The Workers' Party was founded in 1980, during the military dictatorship (1964-1985). Its founders included trade unionists, intellectuals, left-wing activists, and members of social movements. The party was born with a strong left-wing ideological base, defending principles such as participatory democracy, social justice, labour rights, and agrarian reform. Its foundation was a response to the need for a political alternative during the dictatorship, representing the interests of workers and marginalized sectors of society. The party grew quickly. In the 1982 municipal elections, it won several important mayorships. In 1986, it elected its first federal and state deputies. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (better known as Lula), a former metalworker and union leader, emerged as a prominent figure in the party. His charismatic leadership and mobilization capacity contributed significantly to the party growth. He ran for president in 1989, 1994, 1998 and was finally elected in 2002. During PT governments, mainly under Lula (2003-2010), Brazil experienced significant changes. Social programs such as Bolsa Família, the increase in the minimum wage, and social inclusion policies were implemented, contributing to the reduction of poverty. During mid 2000s and 2010s, PT faced a series of challenges, including corruption scandals that damaged its reputation. Mensalão, in 2005, and Operation Car Wash, from 2014, resulted in investigations and convictions of party members, including Lula. These events had a significant impact on PT's image and popularity. After Dilma's impeachment in 2016, the party become opposition for the first time after 13 years as government. It tried to regain power in the 2018 presidential elections, but its nominee, Fernando Haddad, lost to Jair Bolsonaro, who since became PT's main opponent. In 2022, with Lula's release ordered by the Superior Federal Court (STF), the party had him as presidential candidate and won. Since 2023, the party controls federal government. == Electoral history == ===Presidential elections=== Election Candidate Running mate Coalition First round First round Second round Result Votes Candidate % Votes % 1989 Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) José Paulo Bisol (PSB) PT; PSB; PCdoB 11,622,673 16.1% (#2) 31,076,364 47.0% (#2) Lost 1994 Aloizio Mercadante (PT) PT; PSB; PCdoB; PPS; PV; PSTU 17,122,127 27.0% (#2) – – Lost 1998 Leonel Brizola (PDT) PT; PDT; PSB; PCdoB; PCB 21,475,211 31.7% (#2) – – Lost 2002 José Alencar (PL) PT; PL; PCdoB; PMN; PCB 39,455,233 46.4% (#1) 52,793,364 61.3% (#1) Elected 2006 José Alencar (PRB) PT; PRB; PCdoB 46,662,365 48.6% (#1) 58,295,042 60.8% (#1) Elected 2010 Dilma Rousseff (PT) Michel Temer (PMDB) PT; PMDB; PR; PSB; PDT; PCdoB; PSC; PRB; PTC; PTN 47,651,434 46.9% (#1) 55,752,529 56.1% (#1) Elected 2014 PT; PMDB; PSD; PP; PR; PDT; PRB; PROS; PCdoB 43,267,668 41.6% (#1) 54,501,118 51.6% (#1) Elected 2018 Fernando Haddad (PT) Manuela d'Ávila (PCdoB) PT; PCdoB; PROS 31,341,997 29.3% (#2) 47,040,380 44.8% (#2) Lost 2022 Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) Geraldo Alckmin (PSB) PT; PCdoB; PV; PSOL; REDE; PSB; Solidariedade; Avante; Agir 57,259,405 48.4% (#1) 60,325,504 50.9% (#1) Elected Source: Election Resources: Federal Elections in Brazil – Results Lookup ===Chamber of Deputies and Senate elections=== Election Chamber of Deputies Federal Senate Status Votes % Seats +/– Votes % Seats +/– 1982 1,458,719 3.5 8 1,538,786 3.6 1986 3,253,999 6.9 8 1990 4,128,052 10.2 19 1 1994 5,959,854 13.1 14 13,198,319 13.8 3 1998 8,786,528 13.2 9 11,392,662 18.4 3 2002 16,094,080 18.4 33 32,739,665 21.3 7 2006 13,989,859 15.0 8 16,222,159 19.2 4 2010 16,289,199 16.9 5 39,410,141 23.1 5 2014 13,554,166 14.0 20 15,155,818 17.0 3 2018 10,126,611 10.3 12 24,785,670 14.5 6 2022 15,354,125 13.9 13 12,456,553 12.2 3 Sources: Georgetown University, Election Resources, Rio de Janeiro State University == References == == Other websites == * Official PT website Category:1980 establishments Category:1980s establishments in Brazil Category:Workers' Party (Brazil)",
