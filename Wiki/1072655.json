 "text": "Ueno Zoo Monorail was a monorail in Ueno Park in Tokyo. It opened in 1957, and it ran in the Ueno Zoo, from the East Park to the West Park. It was only 300 meters long and it had two stations. It took about one minute and thirty seconds to get from the East Park to the West Park. Some people thought that this was just a amusement ride, but it was a railway under the law, because it crossed over a public street. It stopped running on October 31, 2019 because the monorail became too old to run. Because this monorail was a special type (only here in the world), making a new monorail was difficult. It was officially closed on December 27, 2023. Instead of this monorail, new ride will open in 2026.上野動物園のモノレール 廃止決定の理由とは 新たな乗り物はいつ？ (in Japanese) NHK上野動物園モノレール(in Japanese) Bureau of Transportation, Tokyo Metropolitan Government == Sources == Category:Transport in Tokyo Category:Japanese railways",
