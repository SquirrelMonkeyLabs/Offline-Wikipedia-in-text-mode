 "text": "The Serbian Radical Party (Serbian: Српска Радикална Странка / Srpska Radikalna Stranka SRS) is an ultranationalist political party in Serbia founded in 1991 by Vojislav Šešelj, who is still the party's leader and Tomislav Nikolić, the latter of which would go on to found the Serbian Progressive Party. In the 1990s, the party supported the then leading Socialist Party of Serbia, which helped the SRS gain popularity through its control of the media, until the 2000 elections where it suffered a major defeat, though it was able to gain back some of its support through populism. In 2008, Šešelj voluntarily surrendered himself to the Hague, where he went on trial for alleged war crimes he committed during the Bosnian War. Nikolić would soon leave to create the SNS, leaving the party in shambles, with it getting just 2% of the vote in 2014, which isnćt enough to get a seat in the National Assembly. After Šešelj's return, it once again saw a rise in popularity, getting 8% of the vote in 2016, after which it once again went into decline, and was kicked out of the assembly for the second time in 2020. The Party supports Serbia gaining more land, as well as being anti-western, pro-russian and traditionalist on social issues. Category:CS1 maint: location",
