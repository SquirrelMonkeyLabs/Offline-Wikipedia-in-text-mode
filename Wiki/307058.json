 "text": "Malcolm James McCormick (January 19, 1992 – September 7, 2018), known under the professional name Mac Miller, was an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer. He was also noted under the pseudonym Larry Fisherman. In early 2010, Miller signed a record deal with Pittsburgh-based indie record label Rostrum Records. Later, he began recording his first studio album, Blue Slide Park, and released it on November 8, 2011. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it the first independently distributed debut album to top the chart since rap duo Tha Dogg Pound's album, Dogg Food, in 1995. In early 2013, Miller launched REMember Music, his own record label imprint. It was named after a friend who died. Miller's second album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off, was released on June 18, 2013. In January 2014, Miller announced he was no longer signed to Rostrum Records. In October 2014, it was reported Miller signed a record deal for him and his label REMember (with Warner Bros. Records). Miller died of an accidental drug overdose on September 7, 2018 at the age of 26. The cause of death was because Miller had mixed Fentanyl with Cocaine. == Discography == === Studio albums === List of studio albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions Sales Certifications US US R&B; /HH AUS BEL (FL) CAN DEN FRA Peaks in France: * All except noted: * The Divine Feminine: NLD NZ Peaks in New Zealand: * All except noted: * Swimming: UK Peaks in the United Kingdom: * All except noted: * Blue Slide Park: Blue Slide Park * Released: November 8, 2011 * Label: Rostrum * Format: CD, LP, digital download 1 1 — 185 8 40 175 — — 143 * US: 344,000 * RIAA: Gold * MC: Gold Watching Movies with the Sound Off * Released: June 18, 2013 * Label: Rostrum * Format: CD, LP, digital download 3 3 — 82 4 — — — 36 56 * US: 250,000 * RIAA: Gold GO:OD AM * Released: September 18, 2015 * Label: Warner Bros. * Format: CD, LP, digital download 4 2 32 74 7 — 117 86 29 76 * US: 92,000 * RIAA: Gold The Divine Feminine * Released: September 16, 2016 * Label: Warner Bros. * Format: CD, LP, digital download 2 1 13 38 6 — 64 30 17 59 * US: 32,000 Swimming * Released: August 3, 2018 * Label: Warner Bros. * Format: CD, LP, digital download 3 3 7 15 4 13 42 9 7 17 * US: 30,000 * RIAA: Gold Circles * Released: January 17, 2020 * Label: Warner * Format: CD, LP, digital download — — — — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. === Singles === List of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions and certifications, showing year released and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US US R&B; /HH AUS Peaks in Australia: * \"Dang!\": * \"Self Care\": BEL (FL) Tip CAN FRA NZ Hot * \"Time\": UK \"Nikes on My Feet\" 2010 — — — — — — — — K.I.D.S. \"Kool Aid & Frozen Pizza\" — — — — — — — — \"Knock Knock\" 88 — — — 71 — — — * RIAA: Gold \"Senior Skip Day\" — — — — — — — — \"On and On\" 2011 — — — — — — — — On and On and Beyond \"Donald Trump\" 75 — — — — 110 — — * RIAA: Platinum Best Day Ever \"Frick Park Market\" 60 — — — — — — — Blue Slide Park \"Party on Fifth Ave.\" 64 — — — — — — — * RIAA: Gold \"Up All Night\" — — — — — — — — \"Loud\" 2012 53 — — — 71 — — — * RIAA: Gold Macadelic \"Lucky Ass Bitch\" (featuring Juicy J) 2013 — — — — — — — — \"S.D.S.\" — 41 — 74 — — — — Watching Movies with the Sound Off \"Watching Movies\" — 33 — — — — — — \"Diablo\" 2014 — — — — — — — — Faces \"100 Grandkids\" 2015 100 28 — 25 — — — — GO:OD AM \"Break the Law\" — — — — — — — — \"Clubhouse\" — — — — — — — — \"Weekend\" (featuring Miguel) 2016 — 46 — — — — — — * RIAA: Platinum \"Dang!\" (featuring Anderson Paak) — 45 99 3 — 76 — — * RIAA: Gold The Divine Feminine \"We\" (featuring CeeLo Green) — — — — — — — — \"My Favorite Part\" (featuring Ariana Grande) — — — — — — — — \"Buttons\" 2018 — — — — — — — — rowspan=\"2\" \"Programs\" — — — — — — — — \"Small Worlds\" — — — — — — — — Swimming \"Self Care\" 33 18 83 — 38 — 5 61 * RIAA: Platinum \"What's the Use?\" — — — — — — — — \"Time\" (with Free Nationals and Kali Uchis) 2019 — — — — — — 22 — Free Nationals \"Good News\" 2020 — — — 22 — — — 49 Circles \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. == References == ==Other websites== * * Mac Miller on MTV Category:1992 births Category:2018 deaths Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American singer- songwriters Category:Accidental deaths in the United States Category:American hip hop record producers Category:American jazz singers Category:American songwriters Category:American television personalities Category:Drug-related deaths in the United States Category:Jewish American musicians Category:American pop rappers Category:Rappers from Pennsylvania Category:Singers from Pittsburgh",
