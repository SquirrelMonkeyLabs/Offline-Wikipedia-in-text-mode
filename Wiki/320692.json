When she arrives back to her tribe, Pocahontas' father Chief Powhatan tells her that she will marry Kocoum, a brave warrior. Pocahontas does not like Kocoum because he is very \"serious\". She later leaves off to see her Grandmother Willow, a spiritual willow tree who gives advise and wisdom. Grandmother Willow warns Pocahontas that the British are coming. Governor Ratcliffe lands in the United States (New World) and names it James Town. He then tells the crew to dig for gold. Explorer John Smith goes out to explore the surroundings. He and Pocahontas meet and become interested in one another. Smith shares his knowledge of how his \"people\" live their lives. Pocahontas is offended when Smith calls her people \"savages\" because they do not have any modern buildings or a society ruled by a king. Pocahontas then shares her knowledge and shows Smith that family values, life and nature are the most important things then having a king and buildings (\"Colors of The Wind\"). After this, Pocahontas and Smith fall in love. Chief Powhatan warns Pocahontas to stay away from the British because of their weapons. After finding Pocahontas and Smith kissing, Kocoum fights Smith and tries to kill him. Thomas witnesses the fight and kills Kocoum with a gun. This results in a battle between the Native Americans and the British. Smith is kept captive by the Native Americans who want to kill Smith. Pocahontas successfully saves Smith from being killed. While witnessing the whole situation, Ratcliffe tries to shoot Chief Powhatan, though Smith takes the bullet to save him. In the end, Smith is forced to go back to London to get treatment without Pocahontas. == Cast == Figur Originalröst Pocahontas Irene Bedard Judy Kuhn John Smith Mel Gibson John Ratcliffe (Governor) David Ogden Stiers Thomas Christian Bale Hövding Powhatan Russell Means Jim Cummings Gammelmor Pilrot Linda Hunt Kocoum James Apaumut Fall Nakoma Michelle St. John Lon Joe Baker Ben Billy Connolly Kekata Gordon Tootoosis Jim Cummings Wiggins David Ogden Stiers Meeko John Kassir Percy Danny Mann Flit Frank Welker == Other websites == * Category:1995 movies Category:1990s biographical movies Category:1995 romance movies Category:1995 animated movies Category:1990s historical movies Category:1995 musical movies Category:American biographical movies Category:American romance movies Category:American musical movies Category:English-language movies Category:Fiction set in the past Category:Movies about Native Americans Category:Movies about interracial romance Category:Movies composed by Alan Menken Category:Movies composed by James Newton Howard Category:Movies set in Virginia Category:Movies that won the Best Original Song Academy Award Category:Pocahontas (Disney) Category:Movies set in the 17th century",
