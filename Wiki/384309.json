It is the second and last game for the Wii (the first being Mario Party 8).

The vehicle is themed around the board. Players no longer collect coins and stars. Instead, they collect Mini Stars. Mini Stars are collected by passing by a space with them. There are also spaces with Mini Ztars, which deduct a player's Mini Star amount. Mini-games are no longer played after the end of each turn. Instead, mini-games are played by landing on a mini-game space. At the end of a mini-game, players are ranked from first to last place. Players who earn high positions earn more Mini Stars. Seven boards are available. One of the boards must be unlocked. Boards now take a straight path. A game ends when the players go around the board once. After a game ends, the players face off against a boss. Each board has a different boss. Twelve characters are available to play as. Two of the characters must be unlocked in Solo Mode. ==References== ==Other websites== *Mario Party 9 North American official website Category:2012 video games Category:Mario Party games Category:Wii games Category:Wii-only games",
