 "text": "Therese Johannessen disappeared without a trace from her home in Fjell, Drammen on 3 July 1988. She disappeared after going to a nearby kiosk to buy sweets. Therese Johannessen has never been found, despite many search operations and police investigations. In Norway, the disappearance of Therese Johannessen is sometimes called the Therese case (). The police think that the disappearance is a criminal case. In 1998, Swede Thomas Quick was convicted in the case after confessing to kidnapping and killing the nine-year-old. Quick later retracted the confession, and the Swedish Prosecution Authority overturned the sentence in March 2011. The case has been re-investigated many times, most recently in 2013. In July 2013, 25 years after the disappearance, the case was no longer being considered because of the then 25-year time limit for serious criminal cases. No perpetrator will be punished in the case. In 2020, NRK showed a series about the Therese case called \"\". It was made by Monster Media. == The disappearance == On the evening of Sunday, 3 July 1988, nine-year-old Therese Johannesen (born 1979) was playing outside where she lived, in Fjell, Drammen. She played with three friends and her little sister. At 19:25 it started to rain and Therese got an umbrella. The other children she was playing with wanted to stop at the kiosk she was at earlier in the day. The woman who worked at the kiosk saw Therese earlier, when she bought cola with money she got from her grandparents. The children asked Therese to join them at the kiosk, but she wanted to wait for them. When they returned, Therese was gone. This is the last confirmed sighting of the nine-year-old. Therese Johannesen was then wearing a white t-shirt, denim skirt, striped socks, and gray shoes. When the nine-year-old did not come home, the family started looking, and eventually the police were called. Crews from the Red Cross and Civil Defense helped search using helicopters and other equipment, but the girl remained missing. Eventually, the police started to consider the disappearance a criminal case. The police's main theory is that Therese was kidnapped and later killed. The case attracted a lot of attention in Norway after the disappearance. Over one hundred police officers from the Drammen Police and Kripos helped investigate. It was the most expensive and thorough investigation in Norway at the time. In the first year after the disappearance, the police questioned 1,721 people, and they got 4,646 tips from people. They also had lists of 10,640 people, 4,415 vehicles, and 13,685 movements of people and cars. The police have not found a single trace of the girl, or any suspect. == Thomas Quick== After one year of investigation, the police scaled back the case, but never closed it fully. In 1996, the apparent Swedish serial killer Thomas Quick admitted to kidnapping and killing the girl in Drammen. The confession led to the police resuming the investigation. They started an extensive search for Therese in the pound Ringen near Mysen in Østfold. After emptying the pond, the police found what they thought was burnt remains from the missing nine-year-old. The remains later turned out to be wood chips. Quick was linked to the murder through his confession and the \"remains\", and on 2 June 1998 he was convicted of killing Therese Johannesen. Quick was convicted in six other trials of seven other murders. In an SVT documentary in 2008, Quick retracted the confession and wanted to be tried again. He said he had read about the case in the newspaper VG, and he made up a story where he kidnapped and killed the girl. In March 2011 the judgement was overturned. The case was also re-investigated, but on 3 July 2013, 25 years after she was last seen, the case became obsolete. If the disappearance is found to be a case of murder, nobody would be prosecuted. That same autumn, the police received a tip that Therese was abducted and killed in 1988, and the police shortly reopened the case, without result. In 2017, the police decided that the Therese case should be transferred to the \"cold case group\", even though the case is already obsolete. == Other == The Therese case has received a lot of media attention in Norway. It is one of the most famous unsolved criminal mysteries in the country. The case has also been linked to other similar disappearance cases, including the Marianne case from Risør in 1981. In November 2020, Therese Johannessen's DNA was found on an eraser and pilowcase. == References == Category:1980s crimes in Europe Category:Missing people Category:1980s crimes Category:1988 events Category:1988 in Europe",
