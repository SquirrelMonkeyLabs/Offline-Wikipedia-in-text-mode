 "text": "An online marketplace is a website where different sellers offer products or services for customers to buy. These websites are a type of e-commerce where many sellers use the same platform to sell their items. In an online marketplace, the website handles payments, and the sellers deliver the products. People can register to sell anything from one item to many items, usually by paying a small fee. Online marketplaces often have more products and better availability than single-store websites. Some marketplaces sell all kinds of items, while others focus on specific types of products or customers. Online marketplaces became popular around 2014. == References == Category:E-commerce",
