 "text": "Embarrassment is a feeling that human beings can have. It is an emotion. Embarrassment is painful to feel. People feel embarrassed if they think they might have done something bad or if they think they broke a social rule. People can feel embarrassed even if they really did something good. For example, sometimes people feel embarrassed when someone says something good about them. Psychologists say embarrassment is in the same group as shame and guilt. A person who feels embarrassed may start to sweat or stammer when they speak. If the person has pale skin, he or she may blush, meaning the skin becomes redder. People who feel embarrassed may also smile or hide their faces. ==References== Category:Sociology Category:Emotions",
