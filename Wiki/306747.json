 "text": "Environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. It is the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the air, soil, and water environments; and the effect of human activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric, aquatic and soil chemistry, and uses analytical chemistry. It is related to environmental and other areas of science. It is different from green chemistry, which tries to reduce potential pollution at its source. Environmental chemistry starts by understanding how the uncontaminated environment works. It identifies the chemicals that are present naturally. It studies the concentration and effects of those chemicals. Then, it studies the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals. Environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical in the environment. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations, solutions, units, sampling, and analytical techniques.Williams, Ian. Environmental Chemistry, A Modular Approach. Wiley. 2001. Chemists study compounds with biological activity such as pheromones. ==Contamination== A contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there.American Meteorological Society. \"Glossary of Meteorology.\" This may be due to human activity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with pollutant, which is a substance that hurts the surrounding environment.North Carolina State University. Department of Soil Science. \"Glossary.\" Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE). New York, NY. \"Sustainable Table: Dictionary.\" Pollutant. While a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date.Harrison, R.M (edited by). Understanding Our Environment, An Introduction to Environmental Chemistry and Pollution, Third Edition. Royal Society of Chemistry. 1999. The \"medium\" (for example, soil) or organism (for example, fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a receptor. A sink is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant. == Environmental indicators == Chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, pH, nutrients nitrates and phosphorus, heavy metals (including copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury), and pesticides. ==Applications== Environmental chemistry is used by the Environment Agency (in England and Wales), the Environmental Protection Agency (in the United States) the Association of Public Analysts, and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include: *Heavy metal contamination of land by industry. These can get into water bodies and be taken up by living organisms. *Nutrients leaching from agricultural land into water courses, which can lead to algal blooms and eutrophication.United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. \"Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff.\" Document No. EPA 841-F-05-001. March 2005. *Urban runoff of pollutants washing off impervious surfaces (roads, parking lots, and rooftops) during rain storms. Typical pollutants include gasoline, motor oil and other hydrocarbon compounds, metals, nutrients and sediment (soil).EPA. \"Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff.\" Document No. EPA 841-F-03-003. February 2003. *Organometallic compounds. ==Methods== Quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data for most environmental studies. Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as gravimetric, titrimetric and electrochemical methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. Bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms. ==Published analytical methods== Peer-reviewed test methods have been published by government agenciesEPA Clean Water Act methods: \"Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants.\" Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR Part 136. EPA methods under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA): \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods.\" Document No. SW-846.

Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater (20th ed.) American Public Health Association, Washington, DC. . This publication is also available on CD-ROM and online by subscription. Approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. ==Related pages== * Green chemistry ==References== ==Further reading== *Stanley E Manahan.
