 "text": "The battle of Chatternooga took place from November 23-25, 1863, during the American Civil War. During the war, Confederate General Braxton Bragg attacked Union Major General William S. Rosecrans's Army in Chattanooga. General Ulysses S. Grant took command of Union forces, replacing Rosecrans with Major General George Henry Thomas. On November 23, Grant's forces captured positions at Orchard Knob, which allowed them to make a final attack on November 25. The Union attacked and caused the Confederate Army to retreat to Dalton, Georgia. This defeat ended the majority of Confederate control in Tennessee. == References == Category:1863 events Category:American Civil War battles Category:1863 in the United States Category:Chattanooga, Tennessee",
