 "text": "Umberto II, full name Umberto Nicola Tommaso Giovanni Maria di Savoia (15 September 190418 March 1983), was the last King of Italy. He reigned for 34 days, from 9 May 1946 to 12 June 1946, although he had been de facto head of state since 1944 and was nicknamed the May King (). Umberto was the only son among the five children of King Victor Emmanuel III and Queen Elena. To repair the monarchy's image after the fall of Benito Mussolini's regime, Victor Emmanuel transferred his powers to Umberto in 1944 while retaining the title of king. As a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy was in preparation, Victor Emmanuel abdicated his throne in favour of Umberto in the hope that his exit might bolster the monarchy. However, the referendum passed, Italy was declared a republic, and Umberto lived out the rest of his life in exile in Cascais, on the Portuguese Riviera. ==Titles, styles and honours== ===Titles and styles=== * 15 September 1904 – 29 September 1904: His Royal Highness Prince Umberto of Savoy * 29 September 1904 – 9 May 1946: His Royal Highness The Prince of Piedmont * 9 May 1946 – 12 June 1946: His Majesty The King of Italy * 12 June 1946 – 18 March 1983: His Majesty King Umberto II of Italy Umberto was granted the traditional title of Prince of Piedmont at birth.
