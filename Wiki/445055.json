 "text": "The Pattullo Bridge is the through arch bridge that crosses over the Fraser River. It goes from New Westminster to north bank of the river to the city of Surrey. The bridge was opened in 1937. On January 18, 2009, there was a fire that started on the south end of the bridge in the structure under the bridge deck. The 60-foot long wooden trestle on the south side of the bridge which connects the steel and concrete structure to the earthen berm was burned and needed to be entirely rebuilt. The investigators treated the fire as suspicious. The bridge was reopened on January 26. On July 31, 2008, TransLink planned to replace the bridge rather than try to refurbish the aging structure. The replacement is expected to cost $1.3 billion with it finalized in 2018. Construction began on April 1, 2021 with an expected opening date in 2024. The opening date was later pushed back until late 2025. ==References== Category:Bridges in Vancouver",
