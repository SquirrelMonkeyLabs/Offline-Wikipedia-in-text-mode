 "text": "Glover Road is a street in both the township and city of Langley, British Columbia. It runs from the Fraser River in the north end of Fort Langley to Fraser Highway in the south end of the city of Langley. It is 11 km long. It is one of the main streets in Langley. Before it was built, the area was used by First Nations as a path to cross between the Salmon and Nicomekl rivers. It then became known as Smuggler's Trail when European settlers arrived. When it was being built, the original name for the street was Langley Trunk Road. Some of Glover Road is part of Highway 10. The main Langley campus for Trinity Western University is located on Glover Road. A university district was planned to be built for the TWU on Glover Road but it was eventually shut down in 2024. The street runs through the neighbourhoods of Walnut Grove, Fort Langley and Milner. The road used to travel all the way to the Albion Ferry in Fort Langley before the ferry was shut down on July 31, 2009 when the Golden Ears Bridge opened a month earlier. Glover Road is named after Lieutenant Frank W. Glover, who served in the Canadian Engineers during World War I. ==References== Category:Roads in British Columbia",
