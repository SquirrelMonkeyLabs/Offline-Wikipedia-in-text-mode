 "text": "The Azerbaijan Cup is a major association football competition in Azerbaijan. In its original form, it started in 1936, when the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was a republic of the Soviet Union and it was not disputed by Azerbaijani teams in the Soviet league pyramid. Compared to cups in many other countries, Azerbaijan attracts considerably less public interest and even the cup final tickets are rarely sold out. Consequently, the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan has experimented with the cup in order to raise public interest for the cup. == Format == The clubs from Azerbaijan First Division (2nd tier) play in the First Round. The winners of that round advance to the Second Round, where the clubs from the Azerbaijani Premier League (1st tier) join. For the quarterfinals and the semifinals, the round- robin system is used. For the finals, the format is restored to head-to-head. ==Participants== All clubs from the Azerbaijani Premier League and the Azerbaijan First Division. ==Soviet time Cup winners== * 1936: Stroitel Yuga Baku * 1937: Temp Baku * 1938: Temp Baku * 1939: Lokomotiv Baku * 1940: Dinamo Baku * 1941–46: Not Played * 1947: Pischevik Baku * 1948: Pischevik Baku * 1949: KKF Baku * 1950: Trudovye Rezervy Baku * 1951: Zavod im.
