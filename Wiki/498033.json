George Ellicott lent him Mayer's tables, Ferguson's astronomy, Leadbeater's lunar tables and some astronomical instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind that he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thence forward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches.\" (5) (6) (7) Banneker sent George Washington his work calculating a solar eclipse the following year. ==References== Category:1731 births Category:1806 deaths Category:18th-century American people Category:African-American writers Category:Scientists from Maryland Category:Writers from Maryland",
