 "text": "The Hilton Hotels brand was re-united internationally after more than 40 years in February 2006, when United States-based Hilton Hotels Corporation purchased the lodging arm of United Kingdom-based Hilton Group PLC, which had acquired Hilton's international operations in 1987 (the companies had been severed originally in 1966). Hilton Hotels became America's first coast-to-coast hotel chain in 1943. The company places marketing emphasis on business travel, but owns and operates a number of resorts and leisure-oriented hotels as well. As of April 2007, the chain has 229 Hilton branded hotels across the world and has partnerships with many airlines and car rental companies. Hilton Hotels & Resorts is the flagship brand of Hilton and one of the largest hotel chains in the world. The company focuses on business and recreational tourists, so it has hotels in the centers of major cities, near airports, conference centers, as well as in popular vacation destinations around the world. Hilton Hotels & Resorts participates in Hilton Honors, a guest loyalty program of Hilton. Program members who book rooms directly through Hilton services receive exclusive discounts and benefits, such as free Wi-Fi, digital registration, keyless room access and the ability to choose any number you like using the Hilton Honors mobile app. ==Gallery of Hilton Hotels buildings around the world == Image:Chicago Hilton Hotel.jpg|Chicago Image:BeverlyHilton01.jpg|Beverly Hills Image:Hilton Queen of Sheeba.jpg|Eilat Image:Hilton Washington - Connecticut Avenue.JPG|Washington, D.C.
