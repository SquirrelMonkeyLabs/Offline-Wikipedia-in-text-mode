 "text": "Eviless (also called Saturna) is a fictional character from DC Comics, typically associated with villainous roles in various storylines. While not one of the most prominent characters in the DC Universe, she may have been involved in plots that feature supernatural elements or conflicts, often alongside or against heroes such as Wonder Woman or other members of the Justice League. A slave driver from the planet Saturn, she had several Golden Age clashes with Wonder Woman before founding the first incarnation of Villainy, Inc. alongside the Cheetah, Doctor Poison, Giganta, and Queen Clea. == Overview == Eviless is depicted as an embodiment of evil or a character who harnesses dark powers, fitting into the larger tapestry of DC's diverse range of heroes and villains. Her stories may explore themes of moral ambiguity, the battle between good and evil, and the consequences of power. == Powers and abilities == Eviless does not have any superpowers, but skillfully uses a whip to control her subjects. At times, she has appeared to put herself into a deathlike trance at will by stopping her heart. Post-Rebirth, Saturna has an array of magical necrotic abilities. Category:DC Comics characters",
