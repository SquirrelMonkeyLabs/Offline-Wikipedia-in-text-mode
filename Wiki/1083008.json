 "text": "Ángela Ruiz Robles (March 28, 1895-October 29, 1975) was a Spanish inventor. She was known for making the first electronic book. Ruiz Robles trained as a teacher at the School of Teachers in León and became manager of the Escuela de Niñas del Hospicio. Robles made inventions to make school work easier as a teacher. Robles founded the Elmaca Academy with her three daughters in the 1940s. The school provided classes about business management. She lived in a place that did not have much modern technology. Her most famous invention was the first electronic book called the Enciclopedia Mecanica. The invention could show various books in different languages. The e-book could light up at night, recharge, and be used as an audiobook. Robles received patents for her invention but could not secure money to mass-produce it. She was able to finally create a prototype in 1962. Her work was recognized by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Economy in Spain in 2013. == References == Category:1895 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Inventors Category:Spanish people Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024",
