 "text": "Cabin fever occurs when a person or a group of people are immured and isolated in an enclosed space for a long time. It results in symptoms such as sleepiness, insomnia, paranoia, and the urge to go outside. It is not a disease but can lead to other issues. Cabin fever is generally a temporary feeling of negativity, irritability, or listlessness due to being confined to a place for long periods. Not everyone ends up getting cabin fever when immured indoors for long periods. The feelings arise because you are stuck at home, you cannot go out, and you cannot do your regular stuff. People with more introverted personalities, for example, might be better able to stay busy and entertained when they are cooped up at home. Those who are more extroverted, on the other hand, may struggle with feelings of isolation and loneliness to a greater degree. == Symptoms == Cabin fever is a state of mind that can encompass feelings of: * Changes in sleep patterns * Decreased motivation * Difficulty waking * Food cravings * Frequent napping * Hopelessness * Lack of patience * Lethargy * Sadness or depression * Trouble concentrating Paranoia Anxiety ==References== Category:Metaphors Category:Phobias Category:Idioms",
