 "text": "Mohammed Mesfewi was a Moroccan serial killer who is notorious for having drugged and murdered women who came to his shop. In total, Mohammed killed at least 36 women, many of which he had buried under his land. Mohammed Mesfewi was originally sentenced to crucifixion for his brutal murders, but foreign diplomats shunned crucifixion as being too cruel and archaic. So the Moroccan government instead chose to wall him up. Mohammed was whipped for days prior to his immurement and a cavity the size of his body was prepared in the bazaar of Marrakesh, Morocco. On June 11th 1906, Mesfewi was entombed in this cavity. He could be heard constantly screaming from inside his living tomb for two days straight before succumbing to dehydration.
