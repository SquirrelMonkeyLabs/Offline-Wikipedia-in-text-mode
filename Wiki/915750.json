 "text": "Shalwar wrestling () is a common style of wrestling in the districts and villages of Kahramanmaraş in Turkey. In this wrestling style, which takes its name from the shalwar worn instead of the \"kispet\" in Oil wrestling or the \"pırpıt\" in Karakucak wrestling, the Wrestlers wear shalwars and are bare feet. Wrestling begins while standing, when the abdomen or knees touch the ground. Defeat is the belly that sees the sky, like in oil and karakucak wrestling. Once the opponent is down, a single move is given. If this move does not produce any result, it is usually straightened up. ==Photogallery== ==References== Category:Sport in Turkey",
