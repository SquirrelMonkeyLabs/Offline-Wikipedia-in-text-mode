 "text": "Homonationalism is a word for an ideology that brings together nationalism and LGBT people or their rights. It was proposed first in 2007 by an American professor Jasbir K. Puar. It describes an adaptation of nationalist ideology, where it also considers LGBT rights (such as same-sex marriage) as part of what makes a nation great. Because of that, it also sees outside groups (such as immigrants, especially Muslims) as a threat to these rights and to the nation. Puar, as someone who is against homonationalism, thinks that this ideology is used mostly to attack immigrants, while at the same time ignoring issues that LGBT people still face in Western countries.
