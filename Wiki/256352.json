 "text": "Marc Staal (born January 13, 1987 in Thunder Bay, Ontario) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played parts of seventeen seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, Florida Panthers, and Philadelphia Flyers. He is a member of the Staal family. His brothers Eric, Jordan, and Jared all played in the NHL. ==Career== Before playing in the NHL, Staal played four seasons with the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He would win the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the league's Most Outstanding Defenceman on May 7, 2007. He would be selected 12th overall by the New York Rangers in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. On October 4, 2007, Staal would make his NHL debut in a game against the Florida Panthers. He would record his first NHL point, assisting off a Chris Drury goal in a 2—0 win against the Washington Capitals on November 1. His first NHL goal came in a 4—2 win against the New Jersey Devils on November 14. On September 26, 2020, the Rangers traded Staal along with a second-round pick to the Detroit Red Wings in exchange for future considerations. Staal would sign a one-year, $2 million extension with the Red Wings on July 25, 2021. On July 13, 2022, Staal would sign a one-year, $750,000 contract with the Florida Panthers. Staal and his brother Eric would garner some controversy after they refused to wear the warm-up Pride-themed jerseys citing their Christian faith for not wearing them. The rest of the team would wear them. On July 3, 2023, Staal would sign a one-year, $1.1 million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers. On September 5, 2024, Staal announced his retirement from playing professional ice hockey and accepted a job to become a player development assistant for the New York Rangers. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 2003–04 Sudbury Wolves OHL 61 1 13 14 34 7 1 2 3 2 2004–05 Sudbury Wolves OHL 65 6 20 26 53 12 0 4 4 15 2005–06 Sudbury Wolves OHL 57 11 38 49 60 10 0 8 8 8 2005–06 Hartford Wolf Pack AHL — — — — — 12 0 2 2 8 2006–07 Sudbury Wolves OHL 53 5 29 34 68 21 5 15 20 22 2007–08 New York Rangers NHL 80 2 8 10 42 10 1 2 3 8 2008–09 New York Rangers NHL 82 3 12 15 64 7 1 0 1 0 2009–10 New York Rangers NHL 82 8 19 27 44 — — — — — 2010–11 New York Rangers NHL 77 7 22 29 50 5 0 1 1 0 2011–12 New York Rangers NHL 46 2 3 5 16 20 3 3 6 12 2012–13 New York Rangers NHL 21 2 9 11 14 1 0 0 0 0 2013–14 New York Rangers NHL 72 3 11 14 24 25 1 4 5 6 2014–15 New York Rangers NHL 80 5 15 20 42 19 0 1 1 10 2015–16 New York Rangers NHL 77 2 13 15 36 5 0 2 2 4 2016–17 New York Rangers NHL 72 3 7 10 34 12 0 0 0 2 2017–18 New York Rangers NHL 72 1 7 8 18 — — — — — 2018–19 New York Rangers NHL 79 3 10 13 32 — — — — — 2019–20 New York Rangers NHL 52 2 9 11 16 3 1 0 1 0 2020–21 Detroit Red Wings NHL 56 3 7 10 20 — — — — — 2021–22 Detroit Red Wings NHL 71 3 13 16 28 — — — — — 2022–23 Florida Panthers NHL 82 3 12 15 43 21 0 0 0 10 2023–24 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 35 1 4 5 14 — — — — — NHL totals 1,136 53 181 234 537 128 7 13 20 52 ==References== ==Other websites== * *Marc Staal at rangers.nhl.com Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian Christians Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Hartford Wolf Pack players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:New York Rangers players Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:Ontario Hockey League players",
