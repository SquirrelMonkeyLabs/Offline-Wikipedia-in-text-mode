They took \"band therapy,\" talking for a long time to work out the members' differences after accusations from Dirnt and Cool that Armstrong was \"the band's Nazi\" and a show-off bent on taking the limelight from the other band members.

Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Most of their songs are fast and under the average song length of four minutes (4:00), though some of their songs run on longer such as \"Jesus of Suburbia\" which runs for nine minutes. Billie Joe Armstrong said that some of his biggest influences are alternative rock bands Husker Dü and The Replacements. Armstrong's lyrics mostly describe alienation, hysteria, girls, growing up, and what happens to someone if they take drugs. The Ramones had lyrical themes that were also close to Green Day's lyrics such as hysteria, alienation, girls, and drugs. Green Day has covered Ramones songs a few times, such as recording \"Outsider\" for the tribute album We're a Happy Family, and performing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"Teenage Lobotomy\" when the Ramones made it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. == Band members == === Current members === *Billie Joe Armstrong – vocals, guitar (1986–present) *Mike Dirnt - bass guitar, backing vocals (1986–present) *Tré Cool – drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990–present) === Former members === *John Kiffmeyer – drums, percussion, backing vocals (1987–1990) === Current touring musicians === *Jason Freese – keyboards, piano, acoustic guitar, trombone, saxophone, accordion, backing vocals (2004–present) *Jason White – guitar, backing vocals (1999-present, full member 2012-2016) *Kevin Preston – guitar, backing vocals (2019-present) === Former touring musicians === *Kurt Lohmiller – trumpet, timpani, percussion, vocals (1999–2004) *Gabrial McNair – trombone, tenor saxophone (1999–2001) *Garth Schultz - trombone, trumpet *Ronnie Blake – trumpet, timpani, percussion, backing vocals (2004–present) *Mike Pelino – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2004–present) === Session musicians === *Rob Cavallo – piano on American Idiot (2004) *Stephen Bradley – trumpet on Warning (2000) and Nimrod (1997) *Petra Haden – violin on Nimrod (1997) *Gabrial McNair – trombone on Nimrod (1997) == Discography == === Studio albums === * 39/Smooth (1990) * Kerplunk (1991) * Dookie (1994) * Insomniac (1995) * Nimrod (1997) * Warning (2000) * American Idiot (2004) * 21st Century Breakdown (2009) * ¡Uno!
