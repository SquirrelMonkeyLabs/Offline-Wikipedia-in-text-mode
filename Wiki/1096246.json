 "text": "Astrochemistry is the study of how atoms react with each other outside our planet. They make the molecules in planets, stars, and other stellar things. It is a combination of astronomy, astrophysics, and chemistry. Astrochemistry is sometimes combined with nuclear physics when dealing with the nuclear reactions that happen within stars. Astrochemistry is different from cosmochemistry as astrochemistry talks about things outside our Solar System, while cosmochemistry talks about things within the Solar system. == Discoveries == In October 2011, scientists from Hong Kong reported that unexpectedly complex organic compounds exist in the universe. In August 2012, astronomers at Copenhagen University discovered sugar molecules in the gas surrounding a star about 400 light-years away. Although this does not prove that there is other life in space, it does show there could be. ==References== Category:Astronomy",
