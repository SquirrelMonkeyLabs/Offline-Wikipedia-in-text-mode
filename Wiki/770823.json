 "text": "Kountze is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. \"The Gateway to the Big Thicket\" is how Kountze refers to itself. The thicket is a large region of marshes, streams, and dense, frequently impenetrable woodlands that covers an area of 50 miles (80 km) in southeast Texas, around 25 miles (40 km) north of Beaumont. The area is the birthplace of the oil industry in the United States. The Big Thicket National Preserve now protects parts of the thicket on a national level.
