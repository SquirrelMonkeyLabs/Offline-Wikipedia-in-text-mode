 "text": "Sheikh Hasina (; born 28 September 1947) is a Bangladeshi politician who has served as the tenth Prime Minister of Bangladesh from June 1996 to July 2001 and again from January 2009 until August 2024. She is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, one of the founding leader and first president of Bangladesh. Hasina was the longest serving prime minister in the history of Bangladesh. At the time of her resignation, she was the world's longest-serving female head of government. She has been widely accused of being an authoritarian, a dictator even, oppressing the freedom of speech while committing serious human rights violence and holding onto the power through anti-democratic practices. Following widespread protests against her during the 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement and the Non-cooperation movement, on 5 August 2024, Hasina resigned as prime minister. Later that day she left the country to India. ==Controversy== Matiur Rahman Rentu has written in his book \"Amar Fashi Chai\" that in 1987, Sheikh Hasina met the young Mrinal Kanti Das, the vice president of Munshiganj Harganga College Students Union. And after the introduction, Mrinal Kanti Das started living in house number thirty-two in Bangabandhu Bhaban. Sheikh Hasina lived in the same house. Mrinal Kanti Das and Sheikh Hasina used to talk and laugh till late at night by locking the door of the library room of Bangabandhu Bhaban from inside. Mrinal's acceptance towards Sheikh Hasina increased so much that everyone became jealous of him. Mrinal became the closest person to Sheikh Hasina! Her power increased so much that in 1990, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, the general secretary of the Central Committee of the Awami League, was humiliated and thrown out of Bangabandhu Bhaban. One day, four people including Mrinal were playing cards in Bangabandhu Bhaban. It was three and a half. At that time, Sheikh Hasina's only uncle Akram Mamu came and said, \"Don't go to this Mrinal, he is sitting without eating for you!\" To show his strength in front of his friends, Mrinal said \"Hey, let me stay without eating for some time!\" One day Mrinal got angry with Sheikh Hasina and left. Sheikh Hasina herself went and brought Mrinal Kanti Das to Bangabandhu Bhaban to break his anger. After Sheikh Hasina lost the election in 1991, Mrinal left Sheikh Hasina due to various grievances. Mrinal kept smiling and saying, his relationship with Sheikh Hasina is very deep.Matiur Rahman Rentu, \"Amar Fashi Chai\", 26 March 1999, pp. 125-127 ==References== == Other websites == Category:1947 births Category:Prime ministers of Bangladesh Category:Politicians from Dhaka Division Category:Living people Category:12th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:11th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:10th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:9th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:8th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:7th Jatiya Sangsad members Category:5th Jatiya Sangsad members",
