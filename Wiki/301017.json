 "text": "Selena y Los Dinos is the debut LP record by Tejano pop band Selena y Los Dinos. It was released on July 16, 1984 under Freddie Records, an independent studio label in South Texas. Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, removed his children from Freddie Records after he had told him that Selena would never become a famous singer, could not bring in large crowds, and wasn't professionally ready to release a full-length album. Selena was also underpaid because she was a female in a male-dominate genre and no could understand a female singer lead a Tejano band. She was made fun of and even booed off-stage by Tejano fans. Undetermined, Abraham moved his children to Cara Records. The album was re-released in 1995, after Selena's murder, entitled Mis Primeras Grabcaciones (English: My First Recordings) == Track listing == == Release history == Country Release Date United States 1984, 1995, 2002 United Kingdom 1995 Canada 1995 Germany 2002 == Other websites == *Selena official website *http://www.selenaforever.com/Site_Guide/Music_Information.html *http://www.selenaforever.com/Selenamusic/selenadiscography.html Category:1984 albums Category:Selena albums Category:Tejano albums Category:Latin pop albums",
