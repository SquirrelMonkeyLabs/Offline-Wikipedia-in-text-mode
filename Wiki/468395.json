 "text": "The snow goose (Chen caerulescens or Anser caerulescens), also known as the blue goose, is a North American species of goose. Its name comes from its white feathers. Some authorities place this species in the Chen genus.Kenn Kaufman, Lives of North American Birds (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2001), p. 75 Other authorities place these species in the \"gray goose\" genus Anser.Malcolm A. Ogilvie, Wildfowl of the World (London: New Holland Publishers, 2002), p. 38 In addition to a white phase they also have a blue phase.Ducks, Geese and Swans, ed. Janet Kear (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 297–298 In the white phase they are all-white except for their primary feathers which are black. In the blue phase the head and upper neck remain white. == Subspecies == There are two known subspecies: * Lesser Snow goose - Breeds in Alaska, arctic Canada and Siberia.

Ogilvie; Steve Young, Wildfowl of the World (London: New Holland, 2002), p. 38 * Greater Snow goose - It breeds in eastern arctic Canada and Greenland. It winters along the US Atlantic coast.
