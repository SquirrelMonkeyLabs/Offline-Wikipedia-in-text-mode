 "text": "Prince François of Orléans, Count of Clermont (born François Henri Louis Marie; 7 February 1961 – 31 December 2017) was the eldest son of Orleanist pretender to the French throne, Prince Henri, Count of Paris, Duke of France and his former wife Duchess Marie Therese of Württemberg. His mother suffered from toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, resulting in Prince François being mentally disabled, as is his younger sister, Princess Blanche. Because of his illness, his father named his second son, Prince Jean, Duke of Vendôme, as Dauphin of France (his heir). On 31 December 2017, Prince Jean reported that Francis had died in France at the age of 56. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:2017 deaths Category:French princes",
