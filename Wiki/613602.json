He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1999 for his pioneering work in monetary dynamics and optimum currency areas. Mundell is known as the \"father\" of the Euro, as he laid the groundwork for its introduction through this work and helped to start the movement known as supply-side economics which inspired Reaganomics.
