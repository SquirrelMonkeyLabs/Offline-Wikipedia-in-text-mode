 "text": "The 2021 Cuban protests are a series of ongoing protests against the government of Cuba. It began on July 11, 2021 and were caused by the government's violation of its citizens’ human rights (in particular the right of expression), shortages of food and medicine as well as the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Cuba. Cuban president and Communist Party first secretary Miguel Díaz-Canel blamed the United States and the United States embargo against Cuba and economic sanctions for the situation leading to the unrest. ==References== Category:2021 in North America 2021 protests Category:July 2021 events Category:2021 protests Category:August 2021 events",
