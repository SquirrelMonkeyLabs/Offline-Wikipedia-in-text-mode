 "text": "Abby Johnson (born July 11, 1980) is an American political activist. She is known for opposing abortion. Johnson was the clinical director of Planned Parenthood and was very pro-choice. She then had to help with an abortion where the woman was thirteen weeks pregnant and realized that the fetus looked a lot like her baby did and she also thought that it looked like it was in pain. Johnson then decided that abortion was murder so she left Planned Parenthood and joined a Pro-Life group. Johnson wrote an autobiography called Unplanned which became a movie called Unplanned. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:American Roman Catholics Category:American political activists Category:Writers from Texas",
