 "text": "Neozapatismo is a political and social movement. It started in the late 20th century in Mexico. It was inspired by the historical Zapatista movement led by Emiliano Zapata during the Mexican Revolution. The movement is closely associated with the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional, EZLN), which publicly declared war against the Mexican state on January 1, 1994, coinciding with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Neozapatismo combines indigenous rights, anti-globalization, and anti-neoliberal ideologies, advocating for autonomy, social justice, and equality for marginalized communities, particularly the indigenous peoples of Mexico. ==Historical background== The roots of Neozapatismo can be traced back to the 1980s when various indigenous communities in Chiapas, Mexico, began organizing in response to decades of social, economic, and political marginalization. The movement drew inspiration from the original Zapatista ideology, which emphasized land reform, workers' rights, and opposition to oppressive government policies. The EZLN was officially formed in 1983, initially as a clandestine military organization. ==The 1994 Uprising== On January 1, 1994, the EZLN, led by Subcomandante Marcos, launched an armed uprising in Chiapas, seizing several towns and demanding an end to the Mexican government's policies of neoliberalism, which they argued exacerbated poverty and inequality. The timing of the uprising, on the day NAFTA took effect, was symbolic of the movement's opposition to the agreement, which they believed would further marginalize indigenous communities and erode their traditional ways of life. The EZLN quickly gained national and international attention, not only for its military actions but also for its unique approach to leadership and communication. Unlike traditional revolutionary movements, the EZLN emphasized horizontal leadership, collective decision-making, and the use of modern communication technologies to disseminate their message globally. ==Ideology and Principles== Neozapatismo is characterized by a blend of indigenous traditions and contemporary leftist thought. Key principles include: * Autonomy: The movement advocates for the self-determination of indigenous communities, including the right to govern themselves, manage their resources, and maintain their cultural practices. * Anti-Neoliberalism: Neozapatistas reject neoliberal economic policies, arguing that they prioritize profits over people and exacerbate social inequalities. They oppose privatization, free trade agreements, and other policies that they believe harm local communities. * Direct Democracy: The EZLN promotes a form of governance based on direct democracy, where decisions are made collectively and leaders are accountable to the community. * Anti-Authoritarianism: The movement is critical of authoritarianism in all forms, whether from the state, political parties, or other institutions. It emphasizes the importance of grassroots organizing and decentralized power. * Gender Equality: Neozapatismo includes a strong feminist component, advocating for the rights of women within indigenous communities and beyond. The EZLN has implemented policies to ensure the participation of women in leadership roles and decision-making processes. ==Impact and legacy== The Zapatista movement has had a profound impact on social and political movements both within Mexico and internationally. It has inspired a wide range of activists, scholars, and organizations who see in Neozapatismo a model for resistance against neoliberalism and a blueprint for creating more just and equitable societies. The movement's emphasis on indigenous rights has also contributed to a broader recognition of the importance of preserving cultural diversity and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples worldwide. Despite the Mexican government's attempts to suppress the EZLN, the movement has continued to maintain a significant presence in Chiapas, where it has established autonomous municipalities governed according to Zapatista principles. ==Criticism== Neozapatismo has faced criticism from various quarters. Some argue that the movement's reliance on armed struggle undermines its commitment to non-violence and democratic principles. Others have questioned the feasibility of its economic and political proposals, particularly in the context of a globalized economy. ==Current status== As of the 21st century, the EZLN remains active, though it has largely shifted its focus from armed conflict to political and social organizing. The movement continues to advocate for indigenous rights, social justice, and autonomy, and it has expanded its influence through alliances with other social movements in Mexico and around the world. ==Related pages== * Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) * Emiliano Zapata * Mexican Revolution * Indigenous Rights * Anti-globalization Movement ==References== # Collier, George A.
