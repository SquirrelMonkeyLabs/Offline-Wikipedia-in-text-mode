 "text": "New World vultures are the group of vultures that are found in the Americas. They form the family Cathartidae. There are seven species in five genera. Four of the genera have only one species each. These are large birds of prey that feed on the meat of dead or dying animals. The name \"Cathartidae\" comes from the Greek word katharsis meaning to purge or make clean. Unlike other birds of prey, they have a good sense of smell. The opening of their nostrils has a hole through from one side of the beak to the other. Some other vultures hop to move on the ground, but the New World vultures walk. The two largest species are called condors. ==Species== *Genus Coragyps **Black vulture Coragyps atratus in South America and north to US *Genus Cathartes **Turkey vulture Cathartes aura throughout the Americas to southern Canada **Lesser yellow-headed vulture Cathartes burrovianus in South America and north to Mexico **Greater yellow-headed vulture Cathartes melambrotus in the Amazon Basin of tropical South America *Genus Gymnogyps **California condor Gymnogyps californianus in California.
