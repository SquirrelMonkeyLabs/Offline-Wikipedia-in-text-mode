 "text": "Vorticity is a mathematical concept used in fluid dynamics. It can be related to the amount of \"circulation\" or \"rotation\" (or more strictly, the local angular rate of rotation) in a fluid. The average vorticity in a small region of fluid flow is equal to the circulation \\Gamma around the boundary of the small region, divided by the area A of the small region. :\\omega_{av} = \\frac {\\Gamma}{A} Notionally, the vorticity at a point in a fluid is the limit as the area of the small region of fluid approaches zero at the point: : \\omega = \\frac {d \\Gamma}{dA} Mathematically, the vorticity at a point is a vector and is defined as the curl of the velocity: : \\vec \\omega = \\vec abla \\times \\vec v . One of the base assumptions of the potential flow assumption is that the vorticity \\omega is zero almost everywhere, except in a boundary layer or a stream-surface immediately bounding a boundary layer. Because a vortex is a region of concentrated vorticity, the non-zero vorticity in these specific regions can be modelled with vortices. ==Further reading== * Batchelor, G.
