 "text": "NIOSH is one United States government agency that keeps people safe when they work a job. This is known as occupational safety and health. NIOSH is part of the CDC. NIOSH's goal is to make sure that things people wear, to not get sick, work. A thing people wear to not get sick is a respirator. This is a type of personal protective equipment. There are many ways a respirator can be made to not work, so NIOSH has created many rules for respirators over time. NIOSH also does other work to keep people safe, like the work done by the Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health. This work keeps people who work on farms safe. == Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program (FFFIPP) == NIOSH also makes reports on why firefighters can die stopping fires. This program is called the FFFIPP, and NIOSH has been making FFFIPP reports since 1998. ==References== ==Related pages== * Immediately dangerous to life or health * Self-contained breathing apparatus *Gas mask *N95 Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services",
