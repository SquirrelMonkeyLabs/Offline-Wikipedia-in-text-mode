 "text": "Akinator is a video game made by a French company called Elokence. The player thinks of a character, object, or animal and a genie asks questions to find it out, like Twenty Questions. The genie learns future answers using artificial intelligence. ==Gameplay== The player chooses an character, object, or animal. Akinator asks questions with \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Probably\", \"Probably not\" and \"Don't know\" answers to try to find the answer. A guess is made if a likely answer is found before 25 questions are asked (30 in the app). If a few wrong guesses are made, the player is asked the answer. ==Development== The game uses a program called Limule and an algorithm, both made by Elokence. ==Reception== L'Express gave Akinator a 5 out of 5 on their list of iPhone Apps of the Week for September 9, 2009. Excite France liked the game's interactivity and that it was \"revolutionary, attractive, and entertaining\". The game's most popular year in Europe was 2009. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2007 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Artificial intelligence Category:IOS games Category:Video games about genies",
