 "text": "On December 24, 2021, MV Avijan-10, a passenger ferry, caught fire on a river near the town of Jhalokati, Bangladesh. The fire killed 39 people and injured 72 others. The boat had a capacity of 310 people, but was carrying more than 500 passengers, many of whom were returning home for the weekend. The fire started in the engine room and quickly spread to other parts of the ferry. Some blame the poor treatment of the boat as a reason why the fire spread so quickly. ==References== Category:2021 fires in Asia Ferry fire Category:December 2021 events Category:Maritime disasters",
