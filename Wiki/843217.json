 "text": "Leima Linthoingambi was the queen of king Ningthoukhomba (1432-1567) of Manipur kingdom. During the Ankla invasion, the king had to proceed at the war field. At the King's absence in the capital city Kangla, the Tangkhul tribes raided the city. But in disguise as the king, the queen resisted their revolution by offering strong wine at the king's absence. With her wits, the kingdom was saved. This account is recorded in the Ningthourol Lambuba. ==References== Category:History of Manipur Category:People from Manipur Category:15th-century people",
