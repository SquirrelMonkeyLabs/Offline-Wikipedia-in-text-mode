Each of the games in the main series have very little to do with each other, with its own setting, story, and characters. Some exceptions include Final Fantasy X and X-2, the sequel, or Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns. But the games are connected through the gameplay, themes, and 'style'. Newer sequels and prequels are Final Fantasy X-2 and the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII games and films. == History == Since 1987, more than seventeen games have been released. The series started on Nintendo Entertainment System, but today most Final Fantasy games are made for the Sony PlayStation or PlayStation 2. Games have also been released for the Nintendo Game Boy and GameCube. Final Fantasy VII is generally regarded as one of the pinnacle achievements of gaming. A must-play for any gamer. In 2001, Columbia Pictures made a CGI movie called Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. === Exceptions === While it is not actually a Final Fantasy game, one game called Final Fantasy Adventure was released in America for the Nintendo Game Boy. The game was actually a prequel to the SNES game Secret of Mana, but was released in the United States with the name \"Final Fantasy\" to boost sales. In 2003 it was remade for the Game Boy Advance with the title Sword of Mana. In Japan, the Mana series is called Seiken Densetsu, which means \"Legend of the Sword.\" There are three games in the series, but only the first two, Secret of Mana and Sword of Mana, have been released in the United States. ==Gameplay== In Final Fantasy, players control a group of characters. They go through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating enemies. Enemies are found randomly. This changed in Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XII. The player gives combat orders. These orders are \"Fight\", \"Magic\", and \"Item\". The orders are given to individual characters through a menu. This menu appears when in battles. The games have used different battle systems. Before Final Fantasy XI, battles were turn-based. The main characters and bad characters were on different sides of the battlefield. Final Fantasy IV introduced the \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system. It made better the turn-based system with a time-keeping system. This system was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. It gave a feeling of urgency and excitement to the fights. It required the player to act before an enemy attacks. It was used until Final Fantasy X. This game had the \"Conditional Turn-Based\" (CTB) system. This new system returned to the old turn-based system. Magic is common in the game. The way characters get magic depends on the game. It is generally divided into classes organized by color: \"White magic\" focuses on spells that heal teammates; \"Black magic\" focuses on hurting enemies; \"Red magic\" is a combination of white and black magic, \"Blue magic\" copies enemy attacks; and \"Green magic\" focuses on applying status effects to teammates or enemies. There are other types of magic like \"Time magic\". This magic focuses on time, space, and gravity; \"Summoning magic\" brings legendary creatures to help in battle. This magic has appeared since Final Fantasy III. Summoned creatures are called names like \"Espers\" or \"Eidolons\". They are inspired by mythologies from Arabic, Hindu, Norse, and Greek cultures. Different means of transportation have appeared through the series. The most common is the airship. There are also chocobos for travelling short distances. Others include sea and land vehicles. Following Final Fantasy VII, more modern and futuristic vehicles have appeared. ==Released Final Fantasy games== For Nintendo Entertainment System: *Final Fantasy *Final Fantasy II *Final Fantasy III For Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES): *Final Fantasy IV *Final Fantasy Mystic Quest *Final Fantasy V *Final Fantasy VI For Sony PlayStation: *Final Fantasy VII (also released for PC) *Final Fantasy Tactics *Final Fantasy VIII (also released for PC) *Final Fantasy IX *Final Fantasy Origins *Final Fantasy Anthology *Final Fantasy Chronicles For Sony PlayStation 2: *Final Fantasy X (a high definition remake is currently in development for PS Vita) *Final Fantasy X-2 *Final Fantasy XI (also released for PC and Xbox 360) *Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII *Final Fantasy XII For PlayStation 3: *Final Fantasy XIII *Final Fantasy XIV For Sony PlayStation 4 *Final Fantasy XV For Xbox 360: *Final Fantasy XI *Final Fantasy XIII *Final Fantasy XIII-2 *Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII For Xbox One: *Final Fantasy XV For Nintendo Gameboy: *Final Fantasy Adventure *Final Fantasy Legends *Final Fantasy Legends 2 *Final Fantasy Legends 3 For Nintendo Gameboy Advance *Final Fantasy Tactics Advance *Final Fantasy IV Advance *Final Fantasy V Advance *Final Fantasy VI Advance For Nintendo GameCube: *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles For Nintendo Wii: *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Crystal Bearers For Nintendo DS: *Final Fantasy III *Final Fantasy IV *Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift For PlayStation Portable: *Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core *Final Fantasy I and II remade *Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions *Final Fantasy Dissidia For PC: *Final Fantasy XI *Final Fantasy XIV *Final Fantasy XV ==Released Final Fantasy movies== *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within *Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children *Last Order: Final Fantasy VII ==Future Games== A list of upcoming Final Fantasy games. *Final Fantasy XVI (Playstation 5) ==References== Category:1987 Category:Video games about alien visitations",
