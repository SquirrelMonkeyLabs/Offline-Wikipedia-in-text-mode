 "text": "The New Hampshire House of Representatives is the lower house in the New Hampshire General Court. It has 400 members from 204 legislative districts from all over the state. These were made from divisions of the state's counties. On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents. That is the largest lower house representative-to-population ratio in the country. New Hampshire has the biggest lower house of any U.S. state. The second- biggest, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, has 203 members. The House is the fourth-biggest lower house in the English-speaking world (the first three are the 435-member United States House of Representatives, 543-member Lok Sabha of India, and 650-member House of Commons of the United Kingdom). Districts have different seat amounts based on their populations. In districts that elect more than one member, voters are allowed to vote for as many people as there are seats to be filled. This system of plurality block voting often ends in one party winning all of the seats in the district. The House of Representatives has been in Representatives Hall of the New Hampshire State House since 1819. Representatives Hall is the oldest chamber in the United States still being used by a government. ==References== House of Representatives Category:State lower houses in the United States",
