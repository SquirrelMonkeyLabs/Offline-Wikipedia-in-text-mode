 "text": "Voivod is a heavy metal band from Canada. Their musical style has been changing since their beginnings. They started out as a speed metal band, but eventually began adding a mix of progressive metal and thrash metal to create their own unique metal style. Today, Voivod have released eleven studio albums as well as one EP, one live album, two compilations, seven demos and one DVD featuring a live concert. They rose to popularity with their fifth studio album Nothingface (1989), which was the first Voivod album to enter the Billboard 200 charts, peaking at number 114, and is their most successful one yet. The last studio album Voivod released is \"Target Earth\", from 2013. They are working on a new album. The band's bassist, Jason Newsted, joined Voivod after he left Metallica in 2001. ==Discography== *War and Pain (1984) *Rrröööaaarrr (1986) *Killing Technology (1987) *Dimension Hatröss (1988) *Nothingface (1989) *Angel Rat (1991) *The Outer Limits (1993) *Negatron (1995) *Phobos (1997) *Voivod (2003) *Katorz (2006) *Infini (2009) *Target Earth (2013) * The Wake (2018) * Synchro Anarchy (2022) * Morgöth Tales (2023) ==References== Category:1980s music groups Category:1990s music groups Category:2000s music groups Category:2010s music groups Category:Canadian heavy metal bands Category:Canadian thrash metal bands Category:Musical groups established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Canada",
