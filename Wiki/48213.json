 "text": "A count is a nobleman in most of European countries, equivalent in rank to a British earl, whose wife is also still a \"countess\" (for lack of an Anglo- Saxon term). The word count comes from French comte which in turn comes from the Latin comitas, \"companion\" (of the emperor). In feudalism the territory ruled by a count was a county. A woman having this title or the wife of a count is called countess. == Other websites == *Heraldica.org - here the French peerage *Italian Titles of Nobility *Webster's 1828 Dictionary Category:Titles",
