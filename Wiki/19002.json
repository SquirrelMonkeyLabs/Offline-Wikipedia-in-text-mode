 "text": "Nuclear missiles are missiles (rockets or cruise missiles that hit something in order to destroy it) with atomic bombs. In the time of the Cold War the USA and the Soviet Union were enemies and thought the other side was going to attack them. To dissuade the other side from attacking, both sides built many nuclear missiles to ensure Mutual assured destruction. This meant a country that attacked would be destroyed. Treaties were made to reduce the numbers of missiles to make everyone safer. Category:Missiles Category:Nuclear weapons",
