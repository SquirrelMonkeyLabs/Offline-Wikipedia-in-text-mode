MacArthur earned academic degrees from Talbot Theological Seminary. He is now the pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church, a megachurch in southern California, and the president of The Master's College and The Master's Seminary. He has written many books and has been a guest on Larry King's television talk show many times as a representative of conservative evangelical Christianity. His opinions about lordship salvation, church growth methods, and the use of psychology are controversial in Christian circles.
