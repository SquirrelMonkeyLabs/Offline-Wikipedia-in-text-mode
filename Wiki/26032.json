 "text": "Sid Vicious (10 May 1957 â€“ 2 February 1979) was an English punk musician. His real name was John Simon Ritchie and he was born in Lewisham, London. He was a member of the band The Sex Pistols from February 1977 to January 1978, but played his instrument (the bass guitar) very badly. His bad behaviour was more important to the band than playing his instrument well. On 22 October 1978, his American girlfriend Nancy Spungen (19581978) was stabbed to death with a knife in New York City. It is not clear if Vicious killed her. He was charged with murder, and released on bail. Before he was due to go to court, he died of an accidental overdose of heroin in New York City. A movie was made about the lives of Vicious and Spungen. The name of this movie is \"Sid and Nancy.\" Gary Oldman plays Vicious. ==Other websites== Category:1957 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Bassists Category:British punk musicians Category:Drug-related accidental deaths in the United States Category:English rock musicians Category:Musicians from London Category:Sex Pistols",
