It is the major tourist attraction of the city. In 2007, it was the most voted place in an online election to choose the \"Seven Wonders of Brazil\". The botanical garden houses part of the campus of the Federal University of Paraná. It is the unofficial symbol of the city and of all South Brazil. The international identification code is CURIT. ==History== The first Botanical Garden in Curitiba was the Passeio Público (Public Promenade Park), in 19th century. Inaugurated by the President of Paraná Province Alfredo d’Escragnolle Taunay, was the first public park of the city. ===Name=== The official name - \"Jardim Botânico Fanchette Rischbieter\" - is a tribute to Francisca Maria (Fanchette) Garfunkel Rischbieter (1929-1989), pioneer planner in urban planning of Curitiba. ===Current location=== Opened in the administration of the mayor of Curitiba, Jaime Lerner, on October 5, 1991 on an old dump, was created in the style of French gardens. The design of flowerbeds geometrical gardens was inspired by the flag of the city, which can be clearly seen in an aerial view of the place. The greenhouses of iron and glass - the main one of them inspired in the Crystal Palace (a building that existed in London in 1851) were designed by the architect Abraão Assad, who also planned the Botanical Museum. ==Description== The Botanical Garden of Curitiba is the most famous of Curitiba's landmarks and contains many Brazilian plants and from other countries, spread across boulevards and greenhouses of iron and glass - the main one of them, in an art nouveau style with a modern metallic structure, looks like the mid-19th century Crystal Palace in England. Once the portal of entry, may be seen extensive gardens in the French style in the middle of fountains, waterfalls and lakes, and the main greenhouse of 458 square meters, which holds in its interior, copies plants characteristic of tropical regions. It rolls out its carpet of flowers to the visitors right at the entrance, between 6 geometric gardens (each one illuminated by chandeliers with Republican-style, each with five lanterns), each with 4 flowerbeds - totaling 24 flowerbeds - enclosed by buxaceae and adorned with seasonal flowers. This occupies 278.000 m² in area. The principal greenhouse, with three domes, in an art nouveau style with a modern metallic structure, looks like the mid-19th century Crystal Palace in London, England. The Botanic Museum, which provides a national reference collection of native flora, attracts researchers from all over the world. It includes many botanic species from the moist Atlantic Forests of eastern Brazil. The native forest have many paths for walk. In 1995, a U-shaped gallery was built behind the main greenhouse, to host cultural exhibitions. In 2003, this space was renamed Franz Krajcberg Cultural Space, to honor the Polish Brazilian artist. Krajcberg donated 114 artworks, including sculptures and photos, for a permanent exhibition. In 2020, it became the Gallery of the Four Seasons, celebrating spring, summer, fall, and winter. The new structure is 1,625 square meters and has 430 solar panels, which produce around 140,000 kWh of energy per year—about 75% of the total energy used in the garden. In the other side is the Botanical Museum, a wooden building which entrance using a bridge made of wood also. Actually, the Botanical Museum of Curitiba has the fourth largest herbarium in the country. In front of the construction there is a pond with carp, turtles, teal, herons, etc., and offers a lake, an auditorium, a library, an expositions area and a theatre. The park also has tennis courts and a cycle track. ==Plant collections== More than a postcard of the city, or a place for leisure and recreation, is a research center for the flora of Paraná, contributing to environmental education, preservation and conservation of nature. Like all botanical gardens, the curitiban has a great variety of plants and also has the objective of cultivate them, protect them, study them and reproduce them. The Curitiba Botanical Garden is officially part of the Brazilian Network of Botanical Gardens in category “C”, according to a rule by the National Environment Council (CONAMA Resolution No. 339/2003). It is a Conservation Unit with special use, as defined by Municipal Decree 252/1994, so it is not a public park. Its main goals are visiting, research, and environmental education, especially to help protect plant species. The specific rules for the garden were approved by Municipal Decree No. 1583, published on October 11, 2011. This document includes the garden’s functions and also lists what is not allowed, based on local laws. In 2008, another greenhouse was built to research, shelter and reproduction of Brazilian living plants - and in danger of extinction - and Brazilian native ornamental plants. In contrast to main greenhouse, this is not open to the public; it serves to scientific research and is home to rare plants to prevent disappearance of nature. It is made of polycarbonate and has internal system of irrigation and temperature control. ; Garden of Native Plants; In order to appreciate the native plants, in 2007, the Garden of Native Plants of Curitiba was created; every plant in the garden is native, even the grass. Because it has no exotic plants, the garden attracts lots of butterflies and other pollinating insects ; Atlantic Forest Ecosystem; In the past, the Atlantic Forest was the second largest forest in Brazil; currently there is less than 5% of forest in the country. This is the native vegetation of Curitiba. The araucaria moist forests are a subtropical moist forest ecoregion of southern Brazil, and is now one of the most endangered biomas of the world; corresponds to approximately 40% of the vegetation of the Jardim Botânico de Curitiba. The park was created in order to protect this biodiversity. Next to one of the lakes, 200 seedlings of trees and shrubs native of the Serra do Mar of Paraná were planted; the Mountain Range of the Sea () is a 1,500 km long system of mountain ranges and escarpments in Southeastern Brazil, which runs in parallel to the Atlantic Ocean coast. Some planted species were cultivated on the coast of Paraná and then transplanted into the garden of plants of the Serra do Mar. ; Cherry Blossom; Every year, in July, the prunus serrulata blossoms; there are about 30 trees, planted in a path that connects the parking to the portal of entrance of the park. In the capital city of Parana, the first seedlings were taken by Japanese immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, but began to be planted in large quantities from the 1990s, with the opening of the Botanical Garden. Now the seedlings are produced by the city and used in afforestation of streets and squares. ; Garden of Sensations; Opened in 2008, the Jardim das Sensações is a track of 200 meters long where visitors walk blindfolded (without the vision) to know some plants and natural landscapes using the other senses. More than 70 plant species with smells, textures, shapes and sizes fill the course of the Garden. Occupies an area of 2381 meters square surrounded by trees that help to isolate external noise and, to guarantee the surprise, it is hidden by a fence of bamboo. All elements of the track are identified in Braille, the language made with points in high relief used by blind persons. The space is free and monitored, where small groups are organized to make the experience (that can walk the path with or without the blindfold). Receives approximately 5,000 visitors per week. ; Foreign plants; ; Plants of the Paraná River basin; ; Medicinal and Aromatic Plants. ==The Botanical Museum of Curitiba== The Museu Botânico de Curitiba (Botanical Museum of Curitiba) is inside the Botanical Garden of the city; has ample space for exhibitions, library and auditorium.

Today, the collection is the fourth largest in Brazil, with more than 333,000 specimens. The Museum has developed an exchange program for botanical material, and exchanges material with 207 institutions worldwide (53 in Brazil, 154 in other places). Due to this program, around 90% of the collection has been identified by specialists; it makes the Botanical Museum of Curitiba an international reference for botanical material - receives annually an average of 400 research scientist visitors, and includes specialists and graduate students. Each year, the collection increases by approximately 15,000 specimens. ==Culture and arts== ===Sculptures=== Amor Materno (Maternal Love) - Sculpture of Polish artist João Zaco Paraná (stage name of Jan Żak) (1884-1961), cast in bronze and placed in a fountain.

It quickly became an icon of the city, and the image of the main greenhouse is the most landmark used in advertising about the city, becoming the unofficial symbol of Curitiba and of all the South region of Brazil. The greenhouse of the Curitiba Botanical Garden has inspired many buildings in Brazil. In Concórdia, Santa Catarina state, a mall was built with this design in mind . In the same state, the Palácio das Orquídeas (Palace of Orchids) in Joinville also draws inspiration from the Curitiba greenhouse. Similarly, the Shopping Pátio Higienópolis in São Paulo reflects this style. In Sorocaba, São Paulo state, the greenhouse at the Jardim Botânico Irmãos Villas-Bôas was modeled after Curitiba's. The Jardim Europeu in Guarapuava, Paraná state, was also inspired by it. Additionally, the Botanical Garden of Curitiba also has its miniature version in the Mini Mundo Park, in Gramado, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The logo for the candidacy of Curitiba as the host city of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil was also inspired by this greenhouse. ===Thematic lighting=== As the best known place in the city, the image of greenhouse is used from many manifestations: since 2008, the park lights are turned off by one hour as a way to join the Earth Hour (an global event organized by World Wide Fund for Nature - WWF - held on the last Saturday of March annually); every year, in October, the greenhouse is illuminated with pink, to support the Breast Cancer Awareness Month; in December, an Christmas decoration is made, as part of the \"Christmas of Light\". And a thousand days to the World Cup in Brazil (2014), between 16 and 23 September 2011 was made an tribute with the light colors of the flags of each country that has won the championship: Brazil, Italy, Germany, Uruguay, Argentina, England, France and Spain. At the same year Curitiba became part of the cities engaged in the Decade of Action for Road Safety, by United Nations; the yellow color, that in traffic means \"attention\", lighted the greenhouse.
