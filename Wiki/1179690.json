In 2017, Jeremy Wade decided to end the show: \"Some shows can go on forever, but 'River Monsters' has to come to an end. Ten years ago, I had an ambitious list of goals in my head that, at the time, seemed impossible to achieve. However, every challenge has been met. Achieving my most extreme fishing dreams, and being able to share them with viewers, has made it doubly special\". For Season 3, Episode 7 of The Silent Killer, Jeremy visited the province of Corrientes in Argentina. There, he faced a massive stingray nicknamed the River Dog by the locals of Bellavista. It was a huge success for the region, as the animal was a true River Monster, weighing 127 kilos. == Overview == River Monsters follows the worldwide adventures of Suffolk-born British host, biologist, adventurer and extreme angler Jeremy Wade.
