His performances and recording style were consistent with Daptone's revivalist approach, celebrating the feel of funk and soul music from the 1960s and 1970s. One review said he \"echoes the evocative delivery of Otis Redding\". Calling himself \"the screaming eagle of soul\", Bradley was the subject of the documentary Soul of America which premiered at South by Southwest in 2012. Bradley was diagnosed with stomach cancer in October 2016.
