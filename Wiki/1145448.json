 "text": "Legends Tower is a planned and approved supertall skyscraper to be built as the main building of The Boardwalk at Bricktown development located in the Bricktown neighborhood of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Designed to be 1,907 feet (581 meters) tall with a floor count of 134, it would become the tallest building in the United States and North America, surpassing the 1,776 feet (541 meter) One World Trade Center in New York City, as well as the 6th tallest building in the world. Its proposed height is more than twice that of Oklahoma City's current tallest building, the Devon Energy Center (844 feet / 257 meters). The building is planned to be mixed-use, largely containing hotel rooms (under the Hyatt brand) and apartments, as well as stores and restaurants. The Boardwalk at Bricktown development is to have a multi-level (largely outdoor) shopping complex at its base, as well as three other high- rise buildings (all being 345 feet (105 meters)), the residential Ruby Tower and Emerald Tower, as well as the Dream Hotel. Similar to how One World Trade Center's height is a reference to the year that the United States declared its independence from Great Britain, the height of Legends Tower is a reference to the year that Oklahoma was officially granted statehood. == History == The Legends Tower was first proposed in December 2023 as a 1,750 foot (530 meter) tall tower, with its height later being increased to 1,907 feet (581 meters) in January 2024. Zoning laws meant that buildings could not be built over 300 feet (91 meters) in the area, however the Oklahoma City Council ultimately approved the tower's construction in an 8-1 vote on June 4, 2024. ==References== Category:Proposed Skyscrapers in the United States Category:Skyscrapers in the United States Category:Buildings and Structures in Oklahoma Category:Oklahoma City",
