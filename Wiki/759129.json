 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to have spread to Ecuador on 29 February 2020. That was when a woman in her 70s tested positive for the virus. Ecuador was described in April as the growing \"epicentre\" of the pandemic in Latin America. ==Deaths== The city of Guayaquil had so many deaths that bodies were left in the street. Ecuador gave out cardboard coffins because the country had difficulty removing all the dead bodies. The government was planning to build emergency cemeteries to dispose of the bodies which are left in the streets. ==Vaccination== In April 2021, newly elected President Guillermo Lasso said that his main priorities after being inaugurated would be to increase the COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. Lassos said he aim for bilateral talks with Russia, China, the United States, the European Union and Chile to try to acquire vaccines. ==Numbers== The number of deaths was believed to be higher than the official figure because not enough testing was being done. A New York Times analysis found 7,600 more deaths had happened from 1 March to 15 April as the mortality rate spiked to three times as much as usual. That showed that the official death toll was lower than the actual death toll. == Current number of cases by provinces== Provinces Confirmed Cases Confirmed Deaths https://twitter.com/Salud_Ec/status/1255896134024941571 Guayas 11,705 1,059 Indeterminated area (Rapid Test) 8,937 – Pichincha 2,096 105 Manabí 1,299 252 Los Ríos 1,026 76 El Oro 672 114 Azuay 569 24 Santa Elena 534 191 Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas 389 39 Esmeraldas 290 43 Tungurahua 273 34 Loja 257 14 Chimborazo 256 66 Cañar 241 22 Cotopaxi 168 36 Bolívar 167 18 Imbabura 126 11 Pastaza 97 4 Carchi 96 8 Galápagos 70 1 Zamora-Chinchipe 68 2 Sucumbíos 65 3 Orellana 60 1 Napo 54 3 Morona Santiago 44 1 29,559 2,127 ==Notes== ==References== Category:2020s in Ecuador Ecuador",
