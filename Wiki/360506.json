Hooper, born in the U.K., is a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom as his mother was born in Australia.) * Austria: Billy Wilder, Fred Zinnemann (Both Wilder and Zinnemann moved to America in their twenties and became naturalized U.S. citizens.) * Canada: James Cameron (Cameron was applying to become a U.S. citizen.) * Czech Republic: Miloš Forman (naturalized U.S. citizen since 1977) * France: Michel Hazanavicius * Germany: William Wyler, Mike Nichols (After moving to America in 1921, Wyler became a naturalized U.S. citizen in his twenties.
