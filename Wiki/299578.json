 "text": "Andrew Stuart Murray McCall (born 10 June 1964), usually known as Stuart McCall, is a former footballer who played in central midfield. He played a total of 763 league games during his career, the 13th highest of all British footballers. McCall started his professional career with Bradford City, where he made his senior debut in 1982. He played six seasons at Valley Parade, during which time he won the Division Three championship, a title which was overshadowed by a fire at Bradford's stadium when 56 people died and his father Andy was injured. After missing out on promotion in 1987–88, McCall moved to Everton, for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the 1989 FA Cup Final. In 1991, he moved to Rangers, with whom he spent seven seasons and won six league titles, three Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. McCall returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the top division of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to Sheffield United, where he retired as a player in 2005. Despite being born in Leeds, England, McCall qualified to play for Scotland through his Scottish father. He won 40 caps for his country and scored one goal in the 1990 World Cup in Italy. He also played in two European Championships but his international career ended after he was left out of the 1998 World Cup squad. McCall was part of the coaching staff during his second spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker-player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to Neil Warnock until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City for a third time, this time as manager. He spent two-and-a-half seasons in charge of Bradford City, leaving in February 2010. Just before the end of the year, he took over as Motherwell manager. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Club Season League CupIncludes FA Cup, League Cup, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup.
