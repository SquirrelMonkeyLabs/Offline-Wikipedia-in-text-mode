To the west of this section – for – the wall was made of turf. The stone part of the wall was thick and about tall. The wall's turf part was thick and about tall.

Hadrian's Wall was the first of two \"great walls\" created by the Romans in Great Britain. Its ruins are more visible than the lesser known Antonine Wall to the north.It also had small watch towers/fortes along it. The Vallum is a huge earthwork associated with Hadrian's Wall. It runs from coast to coast to the south of the wall. == Construction == Begun in AD 122, during the rule of the emperor Hadrian, it was the first of two fortifications built across Great Britain. The second was the Antonine Wall (now in Scotland), the lesser known of the two. The original wall was 20 feet tall and 8 feet wide. It had a fort every 7 miles that housed a force of over 500 soldiers and for each mile there were smaller forts and watchtowers. There were three legions working on it and in 10 years it was nearly finished. The wall was the most heavily fortified border in the Empire. In addition to its role as a military fortification, it is thought that many of the gates through the wall would have served as customs posts to allow trade and levy taxation. == Tourism == A significant portion of the wall still exists, particularly the midsection, and for much of its length the wall can be followed on foot by Hadrian's Wall Path or by cycle on National Cycle Route 72. > \"Stretching for 73 miles across northern England, Hadrian's Wall is the most > important monument of Roman Britain, and the best-known frontier of the > entire Roman empire\".English Nature.
