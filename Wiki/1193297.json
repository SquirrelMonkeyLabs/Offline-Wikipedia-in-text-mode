 "text": "Aritenyesebokhe was a Nubian king who probably ruled in the second century CE. He is so far only known from his Pyramid Beg N30 in Meroe. Two blocks bearing his name were found in the rubble next to this pyramid. The attribution of the pyramid to this ruler is therefore not entirely certain. His name is also attested on the fragment of an offering tablet, which was also found in the necropolis of Meroe. Aritenyesebokhe bore a throne name based on an Egyptian model and written in Egyptian hieroglyphs: Kheperkare. == Related pages == * List of monarchs of Nubia == Literature == * Inge Hofmann, \"Contributions to Meroitic Chronology\" (Studia Instituti Anthropos; Vol. 31).
