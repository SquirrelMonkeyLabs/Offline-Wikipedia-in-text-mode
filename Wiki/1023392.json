 "text": "The Sumatran bubble-nest frog (Rohanixalus baladika) is a frog. It lives in Indonesia. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that are not too high up in the hills. People have seen this frog between 200 and 300 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. They found the frog on a palm oil farm. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Rimbo Panti Nature Reserve. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on leaves. Scientists think the eggs hatch into tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is almost in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms, for example for palm oil. Bad chemicals in the water from chemicals meant to make farm plants grow can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
