 "text": "The fat-tailed gerbil (Pachyuromys duprasi) is a species of gerbil. Its tail becomes fatter when it eats something. Then it uses it when food becomes scarce. They can live 5 to 7 years in captivity. It is from Africa. They can survive a long time without drinking because they are adapted to a dry climate. They bury themselves under the sand until night so that there are not as many predators that will attack them. Category:Rodents",
