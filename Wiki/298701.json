Once an important engineering centre for the local mine and railway industries, the parish is now dominated by the Eden Project. Historically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish, whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined. The port of Par Harbour, which is in the parish, was built to make transporting these minerals easier. The Cornwall Minerals Railway, which had a depot and station in the town, was also used to move them. The Eden Project is within the civil parish, and about from the centre of the town. The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town. ==References== Category:Towns in Cornwall",
