 "text": "thumb|right|200px| A pressurized heavy-water reactor (PHWR) is a nuclear reactor developed by Canada.Ronald Allen Knief, Nuclear Systems: Elements Of Thermal Design, Volume 2 (London; Bristol, PA: Hemisphere Publishing, 1992), p. 288 It commonly uses uranium as its fuel. It uses heavy water (deuterium oxide D2O) as its coolant and neutron moderator. The heavy water coolant is kept under pressure. This allows it to be heated to higher temperatures without boiling. While heavy water is a lot more expensive than ordinary water, it creates greatly enhanced neutron economy.Manoj Kumar Gupta, Power Plant Engineering (New Delhi: PHI Learning, 2012), p. 104 This allows the reactor to operate without fuel-enrichment facilities (offsetting the additional expense of the heavy water). ==Related pages== * Pressurized water reactor == References == Category:Nuclear power plants Category:Nuclear energy",
