 "text": "Anton Anatoliiovych Babchuk (; born May 6, 1984) is a Ukrainian-Russian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played parts of nine seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Chicago Blackhawks, Carolina Hurricanes, and Calgary Flames. He also played parts of three seasons with Ak Bars Kazan, SKA Saint Petersburg, and Avangard Omsk in the Russian Superleague (RSL) and parts of five seasons with Avangard Omsk, HC Donbass, Salavat Yulaev Ufa, Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod, and Atlant Moscow Oblast of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). ==Playing career== Originally from Kyiv, Ukraine, Babchuk began playing hockey at the age of three. He began his training with the Sokil Kyiv junior hockey affiliate, a team which included fellow future Ukrainian NHLer Nikolai Zherdev. While participating in an overseas peewee tournament in Quebec, Canada, Babchuk's team found itself competing against a team from Elektrostal, Russia. The rival team's coach, Ravil Iskakhov, took note of both Babchuk and Zherdev, and invited the pair to further their development with the Elemash Elektrostal hockey club of the Russian Major League, to which they accepted together. He was drafted into the National Hockey League (NHL) 21st overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2002 Entry Draft. Babchuk made his North American debut with the Blackhawks affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), in the 2003–04 season. Babchuk also made his NHL debut by seasons end, appearing in five games with the Blackhawks. In the 2005–06 season, Babchuk was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for Danny Richmond on January 20, 2006. Babchuk scored his first goal for the Hurricanes on January 28, 2006. He was also named second star of the game. Babchuk played in 22 games with the Hurricanes for the season and was a part of the extended squad of the Hurricanes as they became the Stanley Cup Champions. In the 2006–07 season, on February 6, 2007, the Hurricanes activated František Kaberle from injury, forcing them to send Babchuk down to the Albany River Rats. Babchuk was the only possible defenceman they could send down because he was the only one on the Hurricanes' roster that was not subject to waiver wire claims. The next day, Carolina announced that they had suspended Babchuk because of his refusal to report to Albany. In 2007–08, Babchuk played in the Russian Superleague (RSL) for Avangard Omsk. On July 1, 2008, Babchuk re- signed with the Hurricanes to a one-year contract for the 2008–09 season. He led all Hurricanes' defensemen with 16 goals in 72 games. Following a contract dispute that lead to him requesting a trade out of Carolina, Babchuk turned back to Russia on 19 September 2009, re-signing with Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) club Avangard Omsk. During the very first training day in Omsk, he broke the ice rink glass with a shot at Arena Omsk. Babchuk was chosen to play on Team Yashin at the 2nd Kontinental Hockey League All-Star Game. On July 1, 2010, Babchuk again re-signed with the Carolina Hurricanes to a one-year contract for the 2010-2011 season. This contract was worth 1.4 million US dollars. On November 17, 2010, Babchuk was traded along with Tom Kostopoulos to the Calgary Flames for Ian White and Brett Sutter. In 2015, Babchuk retired from playing professional ice hockey. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 2000–01 Elemash Elektrostal RML 7 0 0 0 12 — — — — — 2001–02 Elemash Elektrostal RML 40 7 8 15 90 — — — — — 2002–03 Ak Bars Kazan RSL 10 0 0 0 4 — — — — — 2002–03 SKA Saint Petersburg RSL 20 3 0 3 10 — — — — — 2003–04 Norfolk Admirals AHL 73 8 14 22 89 8 0 2 2 6 2003–04 Chicago Blackhawks NHL 5 0 2 2 2 — — — — — 2004–05 Norfolk Admirals AHL 66 8 16 24 88 2 0 0 0 2 2005–06 Norfolk Admirals AHL 24 5 7 12 22 — — — — — 2005–06 Chicago Blackhawks NHL 17 2 3 5 16 — — — — — 2005–06 Carolina Hurricanes NHL 22 3 2 5 6 — — — — — 2005–06 Lowell Lock Monsters AHL 5 1 3 4 0 — — — — — 2006–07 Carolina Hurricanes NHL 52 2 12 14 30 — — — — — 2006–07 Albany River Rats AHL 9 1 6 7 2 — — — — — 2007–08 Avangard Omsk RSL 57 9 15 24 30 4 1 1 2 6 2008–09 Carolina Hurricanes NHL 72 16 19 35 16 13 0 1 1 10 2009–10 Avangard Omsk KHL 49 9 13 22 36 2 0 0 0 0 NHL totals 168 23 38 61 70 13 0 1 1 10 RSL/KHL totals 87 12 15 27 44 6 1 1 2 6 ==International play== Played for Russia in: *2000: 4 Nations Tournament *2000: 5 Nations Tournament *2002: U18 World Junior Championships *2002: 4 Nations Tournament ===International statistics=== Year Team Event Place GP G A Pts PIM 2001 Russia WJC18 6 0 0 0 0 2002 Russia WJC18 8 3 3 6 10 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Albany River Rats players Category:Calgary Flames players Category:Carolina Hurricanes players Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Lowell Lock Monsters players Category:Norfolk Admirals players Category:Russian ice hockey defencemen Category:Sportspeople from Kyiv Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Ukrainian ice hockey players Category:Ice hockey defencemen",
