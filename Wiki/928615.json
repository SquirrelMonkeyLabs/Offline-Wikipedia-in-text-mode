 "text": "2022 Sri Lankan protests were a series of protests by many non-partisan protesters, mainly the general public and opposition political parties against the government of president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. They believe Rajapaksa is not doing a good job at fixing Sri Lanka's economy which has caused an economic crisis with severe inflation, daily blackouts up to 10â€“13 hours, a shortage of fuel and many essential items. Many of the protesters want the government run by the Rajapaksa family to resign, and creating new set of qualified democratic rulers. The protesters commonly chanted slogans such as \"Go home Gota\", Go Home Rajapaksas and \"Gota pissek\" (Gota is a lunatic). The protests have been mainly staged by the general public including teachers, students, doctors, nurses, IT professionals, farmers, lawyers, social activists, sportspersons, engineers, and a few police officers. On 9 July 2022, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced their resignations after protestors storm their homes in Colombo. However, Rajapaksa promised to resign on 13 July, but instead left the country to the Maldives and later Singapore and stayed as president. He would officially resign as president on 14 July. On 20 July 2022, Wickremesinghe was elected president. ==References== Category:March 2022 events Category:April 2022 events Category:May 2022 events Sri Lankan Protests Category:2022 protests Category:2020s in Sri Lanka Category:June 2022 events Category:July 2022 events Category:August 2022 events",
