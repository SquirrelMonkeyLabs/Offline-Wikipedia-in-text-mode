 "text": "The fourth presidential election in Hungary after the change of regime took place on June 6th and 7th, 2005. This election stands out due to its intensity and the fierce political battle that preceded it, unlike any other presidential election before or after. The actual voting process turned into an extremely tactical game where opponents used remarkable and unusual strategies, methods, and tricks. The election was won by László Sólyom with a narrow majority against the government's candidate, Katalin Szili, who was the Speaker of the National Assembly at that time.
