 "text": "The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous acropolis. It is a large hill, in the center of Athens, on which the Parthenon and other Greek buildings were built. It is often known as The Acropolis. * The Acropolis is a group of ancient temples that were built on a high, rocky hill in Athens, Greece. The word acropolis even means 'high city' in Greek. Other cities have an acropolis, too, but the one in Athens is the most well-known. * The Acropolis of Athens is the most striking and complete ancient Greek monumental complex still existing in our times. It is situated on a hill of average height (156m) that rises in the basin of Athens. Its overall dimensions are approximately 170 by 350m. * The buildings were a citadel where people could escape to if the city was attacked. The Acropolis was mostly destroyed by 580 B.C. The people of Athens weren't going to rebuild it. However, a hundred years later, Themistocles and Pericles persuaded them to build it again. ** Over the centuries, the Acropolis was many things: a home to kings, a citadel, a mythical home of the gods, a religious center and a tourist attraction. It has withstood bombardment, massive earthquakes and vandalism yet still stands as a reminder of the rich history of Greece.",
