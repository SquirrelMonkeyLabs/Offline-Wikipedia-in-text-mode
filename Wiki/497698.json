He moved to California in 2002 to major in character animation at CalArts. He met fellow animator J.G. Quintel, who was in the same class as him, and the two became friends. Marin would help Quintel on his student films, such as The Naive Man from Lolliland and 2 in the AM PM, and voiced characters in the films. This would have started his career in voice acting. Marin later graduated from CalArts and got a job as an animator at Walt Disney Animation Studios, where he worked for three years before Regular Show was greenlit.
