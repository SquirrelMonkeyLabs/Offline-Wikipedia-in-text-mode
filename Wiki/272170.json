 "text": "The Group 14 elements, also known as the carbon group and the Group IV elements, is a group of elements on the periodic table. Each element has 4 valence electrons. Only carbon makes anions. Silicon and germanium are semimetals. Tin and lead are poor metals. Flerovium, a radioactive element, is not stable enough to see its properties. All of them can form +4 oxidation state compounds. Tin and lead can form +2 compounds, too.
