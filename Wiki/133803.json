 "text": ":Pavement redirects here. For the American rock band, see Pavement (band). A sidewalk is a path for pedestrians that runs along the side of a road. It is called a sidewalk in American English, but can also be called a pavement (mainly British English and South African English), a footpath (Australian English, Irish English, Indian English and New Zealand English) or footway (Engineering term). Pedestrians use sidewalks to keep them safe from vehicles on the road. Sidewalks can be paved with bricks, poured concrete or tarmac. In suburban areas sidewalks are often separated from the roadway by a verge planted with grass and trees. Street furniture (benches, letterboxes, transit shelters, litter bins, advertising columns, etc.) are often placed on or immediately adjacent to sidewalks. Category:Transport infrastructure",
