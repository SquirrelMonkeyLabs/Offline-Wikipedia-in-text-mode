 "text": "Alcohol tolerance is a special case of drug tolerance: with certain substances, such as alcohol, the body gets used to them. People consume substances such as alcohol, because these substances have certain effects. As the body gets used to the substance, the quantity needed to get the desired effect wil increase. == Alcohol-related disorders == With certain drugs, the same is true for stopping: directly stopping the drug is dangerous, because of withdrawal symptoms. So the amount of the drug taken has to be reduced in steps, before stopping altogether. There are drugs that can make stopping easier, because they reduce the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. Consuming alcohol can have significant effects on the body, impacting metabolism, cell function, and various physiological processes. It's important to distinguish between the short-term effects of alcohol (such as intoxication) and the long- term effects associated with harmful use or dependence. Alcohol consumption can also significantly impact brain function, leading to a range of clinical consequences on both neuropsychiatric and behavioral levels, including memory impairment, blackouts, seizures, and others. == References == Category:Alcoholism Category:Alcohol",
