 "text": "The Rose Apple (Syzygium jambos) is a type of apple found in 1762. It is related to the Guava, is native to the East Indies and Malaya. The Rose Apple is cultivated and naturalized in many parts of India, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Later, it was introduced to Jamaica and became well distributed in the West Indies and at low elevations, from Southern Mexico to [Peru]. In 1825, eight young trees were taken from Rio de Janeiro to Hawaii by ship. In 1853, a United States warship delivered avocado and rose apple trees from Central America to the Island of Hilo. The rose apple became further naturalized on the islands of Kauai, Molokai, Oahu, Maui and Hawaii. == Plant Appearance == The rose apple tree may be merely a shrub but is generally a tree reaching 25 or even 40 ft (7.5-12 m) in height, and has a dense crown of slender, wide-spreading branches, often the overall width exceeding the height. The flowers are creamy-white or greenish-white, 2 to 4 in (5-10 cm) wide, consisting mostly of about 300 noticeable stamens to 1 1/2 in (4 cm) long, a 4-lobed calyx, and 4 greenish-white, concave petals. There are usually 4 or 5 flowers together in terminal cluster. == Fruit Appearance == The fruit is nearly round, oval, or slightly pear-shaped, 1 0.5 to 2 in (4-5 cm) long, with smooth, thin, pale-yellow or whitish skin, sometimes pink-blushed, covering a crisp, mealy, dry to juicy layer of yellowish flesh, sweet and resembling the scent of a rose in flavour.
