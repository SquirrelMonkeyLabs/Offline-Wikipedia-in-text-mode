 "text": "Muslims have different dress codes for different contexts. Conservative ideas of hijab require people to dress modestly both for outside and religious contexts. Clothing for everyday wear, inside and outside the house is different, and very much depends on the family. ==Clothes for men== Muslim men are required to dress modestly, especially during prayer. The minimum requirement for covering the awrah (the area from the navel to the knees) is essential for the validity of prayer. It is encouraged for men to wear loose- fitting garments, such as thobes, that cover the body modestly and ensure that the awrah is properly concealed. Tight or revealing clothing is discouraged, as it detracts from the focus on prayer and modesty. Muhammad is reported to have encouraged covering the shoulders during prayer in addition to the awrah, emphasizing modesty and dignity in worship. ==Clothes for women== Islam says that women should dress in a very special way. This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children. Usually, women who travel to Muslim countries should also wear such dress. *Abaya - long flowing outer garment worn over all other clothing. *Jilbab - garment that may be worn like a dress, usually with trousers underneath. *Dupatta - a South Asian long rectangular scarf usually worn over the shoulders in front of the neck, or however you prefer. Women will sometimes use a dupatta over their head for a hijab. *Scarf or veil - the head covering worn by some Muslim women. Some Muslims maintain that the practice (of women covering the head) is not mandated in Islam. The headscarf is a square folded into a triangle or simply a triangle, but also can be a rectangular shape. To wear- bring the two corners together and pin/knot/wrap at the neck. *Niqab - a veil worn to cover the face. A niqab can be made to leave only the eyes uncovered, only the eyes and forehead uncovered, or to leave the forehead, eyes, and nose uncovered, covering only the mouth. *Burka - a long, loose piece of clothing covering the whole body from head to feet, worn in public by some women in Muslim countries. ==References== Category:Islamic dress Category:Hijab",
