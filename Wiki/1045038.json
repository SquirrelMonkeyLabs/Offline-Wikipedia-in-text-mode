They are considered one of the best women's football teams in Central America, along with Guatemala and Panama. Starting in the 2010s, Costa Rica became known for women's football. Just like the men's team, people see the women's team as a tough and competitive opponent, even though they haven't been in the spotlight for very long. In their first World Cup in 2015, Costa Rica surprised everyone by earning two points. They drew against strong teams like Spain and South Korea. They were only knocked out of the tournament because of a late goal by Brazil. ==References== Category:North American women's national association football teams Category:Football in Costa Rica Category:National sports teams of Costa Rica",
