 "text": "Ferit Orhan Pamuk (born June 7, 1952) is a famous Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author. Pamuk is a post-modernist writer. He has won many writing awards around the world. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on October 12 2006, which made him the first Turkish person to win the Nobel Prize. In 2005, he faced criminal charges because of comments he made in an interview. In the interview, Pamuk said about Armenian Genocide, \"Thirty thousand Kurds, and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody dares to talk about it.\" Pamuk faced a hate campaign and he had to flee the country. The charges were dropped in early 2006 under an influence of international movement of Amnesty International and European Parliament. == Bibliography in English == * The White Castle, translated by Victoria Holbrook, Manchester (UK): Carcanet Press Limited, 1990;, 1991; New York: George Braziller, 1991 [original title: Beyaz Kale] * The Black Book, translated by Güneli Gün, New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1994 [original title: Kara Kitap].
