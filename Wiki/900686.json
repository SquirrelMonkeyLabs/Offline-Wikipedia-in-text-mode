They have disks on their toes for climbing and all four feet are webbed. This frog has a brown belly with large brown marks and small yellow marks. This frog has a white or silver throat. The adult female frogs are red-brown with brown marks on their backs. The adult male frogs are black-brown with yellow marks on their backs. This frog looks very much like Ecnomiohyla miotympanum but it is larger and Ecnomiohyla miotympanum is smaller. ==Food== Adult frogs eat insects. The tadpoles eat algae and dead things. ==Threats== This frog is vulnerable to dying out because human beings change the places where it likes to live by building farms. This frog needs the shade from forests or it will dry out and die. The chemicals that human beings use to kill pests, for example DDT, can also kill this frog too. The DDT can go into the frog's body through its skin. Or the frog can eat other animals with DDT in their bodies. Human beings also catch this frogs to eat or sell. ==Humans== This frog lives in a town called Atzalan in Veracruz and it is on the town's official shield symbol. It is on many of Atzalan's monuments. People have eaten this frog for food for hundreds of years, since the Aztec culture or earlier. People cook them in soup or make cakes called Calate cakes. Human beings who live in Atzalan believe the frogs come on the same day of the year, September 29, that San Andrés Apóstol and the Archangel Michael were venerated. People also catch these frogs to use in medicines or sell as pets. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
