 "text": "Brackets is a text editor from the Adobe company, intended for editing JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The source code of Brackets is written using web technologies (JavaScript, HTML and CSS) and is distributed under the MIT license. The editor is designed as a separate desktop application, for which deb, dmg, and msi packages are prepared for Linux, OS X, and Windows. Brackets supports Live development mode, where editable content (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) is immediately displayed in a browser window synchronized with the editor as it changes - the developer can change the content and immediately see what the consequences of these changes are. Debugging can also be performed synchronously with the browser, the developer can set a breakpoint or roll back a step when viewing the results. There is built-in support for LESS and SCSS preprocessors. The interface uses a system of context-sensitive tools that appear as needed in the main development window. To expand the editor's capabilities, a system of add-ons is being developed. == References == == Other websites == * * * * List of Brackets extensions * Brackets Developer Forum () Category:Adobe software Category:Discontinued Adobe software Category:Adobe Inc.",
