 "text": "The self-governance of Singapore happened in several stages. Since 1819 up to 1959, Singapore had been under the colonial rule of the United Kingdom. The first local elections on a limited scale for several positions in the government of Singapore started in 1948 following a change to the Constitution of Singapore. This was further changed with the Rendel Constitution, strengthening local representation. Singapore was granted full internal self- government in 1959, but the colonial administration still controlled external relations and shared control of several key internal policies such as internal security. In 1963, Singapore joined Malaysia, ending colonial rule and becoming an autonomous state within the country. After a fallout in the relations between the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the People's Action Party (PAP), the ruling parties of the Federation and Singapore at the time, full independence came about with Malaysia forcing Singapore to leave in 1965. ==References== Category:History of Singapore",
