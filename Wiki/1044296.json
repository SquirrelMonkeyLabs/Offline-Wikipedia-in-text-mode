 "text": "The Mrosso Commission of 1993 was formed to carry out criticisms against the judiciary in Tanzania that had been re-examined and respond to some of the criticisms, which were not only persistent for years but also valid in some respects. Although some measures were introduced in the mid-1980s, it was not until the early 1990s that members of the judiciary presented findings and recommendations to enhance efficiency, measures meant to strengthen discipline and accountability among judicial officers, and those related to increasing public awareness of judicial activities and public relations. The commission was led by Justice John Mrosso. The Mrosso Commission (1993) states categorically that most of the recommendations made in their report are subject to the improvement of the working conditions and remuneration of judicial sections at all levels. ==References== *Judiciary and Good Governanee in Contemporary Tanzania.
