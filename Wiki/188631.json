 "text": "Wood Street is a railway station in Walthamstow. It is a part of the London Borough of Waltham Forest in north east London. It is in Travelcard Zone 4. It was opened in 1873. When the Victoria line was being planned, this station was going to be the end of the line instead of Walthamstow Central station. A decision was made in 1961 which meant that this did not happen. If this station had become the end of the Victoria line, the building would have been on the surface next to the British Railways station. == References == Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:London Travelcard zone 4 Category:1873 establishments in England Category:Railway stations served by National Express East Anglia",
