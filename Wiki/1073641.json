 "text": "The horned bubble-nest frog (Philautus cornutus) is a frog. It lives in Sumatra, Indonesia. People have seen it between 1529 and 1907 meters above sea level. Scientists collected samples of this frog in 1920 and five more female frogs in 2013. These five female frogs were found on short plants in mountain forests. These five female frogs were 24.0 â€“ 25.8 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is purple-brown in color. Most of these frogs do not have marks or patterns on their backs, but some do. There are some dark marks on the legs. There is a black spot on the rear end. The skin of the belly is light brown in color. There are dark marks on the neck and chest. The iris of the eye is gold-orange on top with dark brown triangles. Like other frogs in Pseudophilautus, this frog hatches from its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
