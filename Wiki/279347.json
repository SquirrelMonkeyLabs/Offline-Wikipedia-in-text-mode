 "text": "The station wagon, or estate, is a variant of sedan. The difference between station wagons and regular sedans is that the station wagon has no trunk. The roofs are extended backwards over a shared passenger or cargo volume with access in the back (like in hatchbacks, minivans, and SUVs). The first station wagons were built around 1910. Their frames were built out of wood. By the 1950s, the wood was replaced with fake wood. Station wagons became less popular because of the 1973 oil crisis in the United States. Station wagons have been mostly replaced by minivans/MPVs, SUVs, and crossovers. Modern station wagons include Subaru Forester, Mercedes-AMG E63 and several Audi automobiles. Other modern station wagons include the Mercedes-Benz E450 and Volvo 460. == References == == Other websites == Category:Automobile body styles",
