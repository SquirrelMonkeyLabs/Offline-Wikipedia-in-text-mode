 "text": "Meteorology is the science that focuses on the Earth's atmosphere. People who study meteorology are called meteorologists. Meteorologists record air pressure, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, weather patterns, and other information. Meteorologists use this data to understand weather and to predict it. Meteorology is a major branch of earth science. Meteorologists study the causes of particular weather conditions using information obtained from the land, sea and upper atmosphere. They use computerized and mathematical models to make short and long-range forecasts concerning weather and climate patterns. A variety of organizations use meteorological forecasts including: *transport services, particularly air and sea travel *shipping and sea fishing industries and sailing organisations *government services, e.g. firefighters or for advice on climate change policy *armed forces *farmers; *public services *mass media *industry and retail businesses *insurance companies *health services In addition to forecasting, meteorologists study the impact of weather on the environment and conduct research into weather patterns, climate change and models of weather prediction. ==Related pages== *World Meteorological Organization ==References==",
