 "text": "Llandudno Junction (Welsh: Cyffordd Llandudno), once known as Tremarl, is a town in the Conwy County Borough, Wales. It is part of the ancient parish of Llangystennin and is located south of the seaside resort of Llandudno. It adjoins the small town of Deganwy and is to the east of Conwy, which is on the opposite side of the River Conwy. The town grew up around, and is named after, Llandudno Junction railway station, which is a junction between the North Wales Coast Line and the Conwy Valley line. There are regular direct trains to Manchester, Llandudno, Holyhead, Blaenau Ffestiniog, Birmingham and South Wales, as well as a few trains a day to London. The Old Station Hotel stands opposite the station. It is known locally as \"The Killer\" or in Welsh \"Y Killer\". One version of the myth on how it got its name is that train drivers would get drunk there, then drive trains, effectively turning them into possible 'Killers'. Another version states that this is where the railway workers would spend their lunch breaks, i.e. 'killed time'. It currently has a population of 6,722. ==Gallery== File:Old_Station_Hotel_- _geograph.org.uk_-_1716467.jpg|The Old Station Hotel, Llandudno Junction File:VT_221_@_LLJ.jpg|A train at Llandudno Junction station File:Cyffordd_Llandudno_-_ger_yr_orsaf.JPG|Main Street, Llandudno Junction Category:Towns in Conwy",
