The game is a sequel to the 2016 video game titled Enter the Gungeon. ==Reception== The game recieved mixed reviews by game critics. Critics said that they felt that it was a nice way to keep the series going and that the game felt fun because of the chaotic nature of it. However, some critics did not like the constant swapping of weapons, saying that some of the weapons felt almost unusable because of the combination of fast-paced gameplay and trigger speed. ==References== Category:2019 video games Category:Action video games Category:Bullet hell video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
