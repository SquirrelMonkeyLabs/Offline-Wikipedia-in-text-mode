 "text": "Since 1961, a total of 30 man-made satellites have been launched with the goal of reaching the planet Venus. The satellites sent were 4 Mariner satellites, from the United States, and 18 Venera satellites, from the Soviet Union, as well as 8 other satellites. Of these, 23 total succeeded (3 Mariner, 12 Venera, and 8 others), 1 was a partial failure (Venera), and 6 failed (1 Mariner and 5 Venera), giving missions to Venus a success rate of approximately 77% percent. == Mariner Satellites == Name Launch Date Country(s) Date of Arrival at Venus Date of Last Radio Signal Did It Work as Planned?
