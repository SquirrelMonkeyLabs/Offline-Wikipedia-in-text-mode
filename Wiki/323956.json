World Wildlife Some experts consider it to be either a variety or a subspecies of the Cedar of Lebanon.The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Garden Plants, Christopher Brickell (ed), Dorling Kindersley, London, 1996. . p241 This tree can grow up to 25 meters in height and 12 meters in width. When young, it has a conical shape, but as it matures, it broadens and develops a flattened top. Its bark is initially silvery-grey and becomes thickened with deep cracks as the tree ages. The needle-like leaves are grey-green to mid- green, occasionally bluish-green, and are arranged singly on long shoots or in dense clusters of 20–30 on short shoots. The cones are cylindrical, measuring 7–10 cm in length. They are green when young but turn pale brown as they mature and shed their scales and winged seeds. ==References== Category:Conifers",
