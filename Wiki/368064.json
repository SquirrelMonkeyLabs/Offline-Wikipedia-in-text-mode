It is about south of the border with the Northern Territory, and south of Alice Springs. It is 40 km from the larger community of Pukatja, where most of the services are located. Yunyarinyi started as a cattle station called Kenmore Park. It officially became an indigenous community when the land rights were granted in 1981. Today, Yunyarinyi has a school, a community centre with a shared kitchen, a community office and a local garage (repair shop). The number of people living at Yunyarinyi is about 40 to 45; many of them are children. ==References== ==Other websites== *Kenmore Park Anangu School Category:Indigenous Australian communities Category:Towns in South Australia Category:Pitjantjatjara",
