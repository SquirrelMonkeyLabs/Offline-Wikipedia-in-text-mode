Its full name was the First All-Union Philatelic, Scripophilic and Numismatic Exhibition. This was because it combined the objects of philately, scripophily (collecting stock and bond certificates), and numismatics (of coins, money). The exhibition was organised from 15 December 1924 to 15 February 1925. This was done by the Presidium of the All-Union Philatelic Association and Board of the All-Russian Society of Philatelists.

The society was to be under the direction of Feodor Chuchin, the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily.Archived from on 2015-05-15. == Related pages == * All-Russian Society of Philatelists * Leniniana * Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily * Philatelic International * Philately * Soviet Philatelic Association * Soviet Philatelist ==References== == Further reading == * Archived from the original and another source on 2015-05-15. == Other websites == * Category:Philately of the Soviet Union Category:Exhibitions Category:1924",
