 "text": "Weilburg is an German town of the Limburg-Weilburg district in the west of Hesse. == History == Weilburg got mentioned in a history book back in 906 by a person named Abbot Regino of Prüm. It was like a strong place called Wilineburch. After six years, King Conrad I decided to build a church and a monastery there because his dad got killed in a battle nearby in 906, and he was buried in that place. In 912, they started a monastery called St. Walpurgis-Chorherrenstift. They put it on high ground, so the monastery could control the Lahn River and important roads like the Hohe Straße (High Road) from Frankfurt to Cologne and the Via Publica from Flanders to Bohemia. These roads were close to the monastery. == References ==",
