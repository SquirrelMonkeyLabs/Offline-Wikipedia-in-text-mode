 "text": "Fjellheisen or Tromsø Cable Car is an aerial tramway in Tromsø, Norway. It has a lower station in Tromsdalen and an upper station called Storsteinen, which offers a panoramic view of the city, surrounding islands, and fjords. The cable car is a popular starting point for hikes to Tromsdalstinden, an iconic peak visible from the city. It is busy in summer due to cruise ship passengers wanting to experience the midnight sun and is also an excellent place to view the Northern Lights in winter. Fjellheisen was built by Brødrene Jakobsens Rederi in 1960 and officially opened on February 22, 1961. It is currently owned by Skips AS Nordfisk and operated by Utelivsbyen AS. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Troms Category:Cableways Category:Tromsø Category:Transport in Norway",
