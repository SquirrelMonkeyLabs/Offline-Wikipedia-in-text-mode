 "text": "The Mayor of the West Midlands is a directly elected political post who chairs the West Midlands Combined Authority.. The first election was on Thursday 4 May 2017. Andy Street, the first Mayor, was originally due to hold office for three years, with the second election for the post taking place in May 2020. That was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so his term was extended by a year. The second term length was reduced to three years between 2021 and 2024. The Mayor's term of office will return to four years from 2024 thereafter. ==References== Category:West Midlands (county) Category:Directly elected British mayors",
