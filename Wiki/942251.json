There were a few notable films in the 1920s and early 1930s, including Scarface (1932), Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931). Films from th e 1930s to 1960s reflected political and cultural views on criminals. Punishment was strict and respect for authority important. Films showed criminals and organized crime as bad things. Several gangster films had warnings before the motion picture. Early films showed criminals as a result or product of society and not rebels. As a result, viewers could sympathize with the criminals.John Baxter, The Gangster Film (London: C. Tinling and Co. Ltd, 1970), p. 7. With the growth of the FBI, there were more films about police and government officials hunting criminals. Gangster films were often about trying to deal with crimes and detectives fighting crime. === New Hollywood === In 1968, the Hays Code that censored inappropriate films was removed. Directors now had more freedom. Some notable gangster films were made after 1968. They include Bonnie and Clyde by Arthur Penn and Mean Streets by Martin Scorcese. The movie starred Robert De Niro. These films began to include move violence and gore. In the 1970s, The Godfather films by Francis Ford Coppola showed the Italian-American Mafia in New York. The Godfather is considered one of the best movies of all time. The Godfather movies changed the genre and made the genre more popular. Many films about the Mafia would follow in the 1970s and 1980s. Important films are the Goodfellas and The Untouchables. Martin Scorcese has made several gangster films from the 1990s to 2010s. Scorsese often works with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
