 "text": "Creepypastas are horror-related legends or images that have been copied and pasted around the Internet. These Internet stories are often short, user- generated, ghost stories meant to scare readers. They include gruesome tales of murder, suicide, and otherworldly occurrences. According to Time magazine, the genre had its peak audience in 2010 when it was covered by The New York Times. Famous creepypastas include Slender Man, \"Jeff the Killer\", Candle Cove and \"Ted the Caver\". After two 12-year-olds committed stabbings in the name of Slender Man, some creepypasta administrators told their viewers that these stories have a fine line between reality and fiction. ==References== Category:Internet culture Category:Horror",
