In 1934 she broke the English Channel swimming record. ==Biography== On 26 August 1933 faber tried to swim the English Channel from France to England. After 11 hours and 35 minutes she had to give op. Her second attempt on 8 August 1934 also failed, after 5 hours. Her third attempt on 18 August 1934 was an success. She started at Cap Gris Nez at 12.45 am and finished after 14 hours in South Foreland at 2.51 pm. After her succesfull attempt, the public interest had waned. On her returnn in Vienna only two people besides her husband were at the station for her. She and her husband were unemployed and became in serious financial straits. In her swimming attempts from 1931 to 1934 Faber had spent all the savings of herself and her husband; about £400. Faber had hoped to obtain a post as swimming instructor, but failed. She was even not hired at a circus. These disappointments left Faber depressed. She attempted to commit suicide by taking Veronal, but was saved by her husband who returned earlier as expected. Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the Vice-Chancellor, helped her and so she became a swimming instructor. Faber died in Vienna in 1962. ==References== Category:Swimmers Category:Austrian sportspeople Category:Sportswomen Category:People from Vienna Category:1894 births Category:1962 deaths",
