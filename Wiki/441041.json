 "text": "Frozen is a 2013 American computer-animated musical fantasy-comedy movie. It was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen. It is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Frozen received positive reviews from movie critics. It was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. == Plot == Anna and Elsa are two princess sisters who live in Arendelle. Elsa, now queen of Arendelle, has the power to create snow and ice and work with them, but she loses control of her powers and puts the people of Arendelle in danger. Not wanting to hurt anyone, Elsa runs away and builds an ice palace for herself. Meanwhile, Anna sets off in the snow and ice to bring Elsa back and make things right with her. On the way, she meets Kristoff, a friendly ice seller, and Olaf, a funny snowman created by Elsa who dreams of seeing the summer. A prince named Hans wants to marry Anna, but later reveals that he only wants to marry her to take down Elsa and get her royal status. As Hans raises his sword over Elsa, Anna stops Hans and freezes because of the cold. Elsa weeps out of love for Anna, and this thaws Anna back to life. Seeing this, Olaf realizes that an act of true love is what thaws a frozen heart. With the power of love, Elsa stops the icy spell over Arendelle, and all of Arendelle live happily ever after, including Olaf, who is able to see summer with a snow flurry over his head to keep the summer heat from melting him. ==Cast== * Kristen Bell as Princess Anna * Idina Menzel as Queen Elsa * Jonathan Groff as Kristoff * Eva Bella as Young Elsa * Josh Gad as Olaf the Snowman * Santino Fontana as Hans * Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton * Ciarán Hinds as Grand Pabbie, the Troll King * Paul Briggs as Marshmallow the Snow Monster * Maurice LaMarche as King Agnarr * Jennifer Lee as Queen Iduna == Production == Plans to make a movie based on The Snow Queen were started in the 1940s. The writers were not sure how its story could go and so the movie could not be made. Later, in 2011, the writers finally found a story to use for the movie and the production team began making the movie, naming it Frozen. The plans said that Frozen would be hand-drawn, but the team later decided to use computer animation. It took only two years to make Frozen, which was a very fast production time for a computer-animated movie. Frozen is also one of the most difficult animated movies to make. The animation team had to travel to a snowy area in Wyoming so that they could study the behavior of snow and simulate that with a computer. They also used a program that could generate a lot of strands for Elsa's hair. An average human has about 100,000 strands of hair, while Elsa's hair was made of 400,000 strands. == Songs == ===Creation=== Most of the songs were made by husband and wife Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, while the movie's background music was made by Christophe Beck. The first song in the movie, \"Frozen Heart,\" was made by South Sami composer Frode Fjellheim and is in a traditional Sami style called Vuelie. ===List of songs=== This is a list of songs heard in the movie Frozen. These can be found on the movie's soundtrack CD. The CD also has the background music pieces used for Frozen. # \"Frozen Heart\" (sung by a group of icemen) # \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" (sung by young Anna) # \"For the First Time in Forever\" (sung by Anna and Elsa) # \"Love Is an Open Door\" (sung by Anna and Hans) # \"Let It Go\" (sung by Elsa; most popular Frozen song) # \"Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People\" (sung by Kristoff) # \"In Summer\" (sung by Olaf) # \"For the First Time in Forever (Reprise)\" (sung by Anna and Elsa) # \"Fixer Upper\" (sung by the trolls) # \"Let It Go\" (sung by Demi Lovato; end credits) ==Criticism== The character Kristoff is meant to be Sámi, a member of an indigenous group that lives in northern Europe. Some viewers complained that Kristoff was not a good way to show Sami because he is light-skinned and blond. Although, today, some Sami look like Kristoff, most have darker skin and hair. When making the 2019 sequel, Frozen II, Disney signed a contract with Sami leaders and hired Sami experts to make sure the culture would be shown respectfully. == Sequels == === Frozen Fever (2015) === Frozen Fever is a short movie made by Walt Disney Animation Studios.
