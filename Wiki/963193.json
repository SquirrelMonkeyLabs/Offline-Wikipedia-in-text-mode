It was released by frontman Dave Mustaine's record label, Tradecraft, on September 2nd, 2022. It is the first album with drummer Dirk Verbeuren, and second album with guitarist Kiko Loureiro. While Megadeth was recording the album, bassist David Ellefson was fired from the band due to sexual videos of him being put on the internet. The bass recordings he made were taken off of the album, and replaced with recordings from Steve Di Giorgio, the bassist for Testament. == Background == The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead! took over two years to make. The band recorded the music for the album from 2019 to 2021. The release of the album was delayed many times. It was supposed to come out in 2019, but was released in September 2022 instead. In June 2019, the band cancelled many of the shows they were going to play at. This was because frontman Dave Mustaine had throat cancer. The band said they would keep making the album. In November 2018, Mustaine posted a few seconds of new music from the album on Twitter. At the time, the album was supposed to come out in 2019. The band went back to recording music for the album in 2020. It was now planned to be released in 2021. While talking to fans on Zoom, Mustaine said the album would be named The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!. He also said that the band might change the album's name later. The band tried to release the album in early 2022, but had problems printing vinyl records. The album was finally released in September 2022. == Track listing == == References == Category:Megadeth albums",
