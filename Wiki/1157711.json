 "text": "VO2 max (also called maximal oxygen uptake) is the highest amount of oxygen that a person's body can use during hard exercise. The \"V\" means volume, \"O2\" means oxygen, and \"max\" means maximum. It is usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (mL/kg·min). == Understanding VO2 max == When people exercise, their bodies need oxygen to make energy for their muscles. VO2 max measures how well someone's body can take in and use oxygen during exercise. A higher VO2 max usually means a person can exercise longer and harder. == Measurement == Doctors and scientists measure VO2 max by having a person exercise on a treadmill or exercise bike while wearing a mask that measures their breathing. The person exercises harder and harder until they cannot continue. The highest amount of oxygen they use is their VO2 max. == Normal Values == Different people have different VO2 max values: * The average untrained healthy man has a VO2 max of about 35-40 mL/kg·min * The average untrained healthy woman has a VO2 max of about 27-31 mL/kg·min * Athletes in sports like running, cycling, and cross-country skiing often have much higher values * As people get older, their VO2 max usually gets lower * Training can help improve someone's VO2 max == Why VO2 max is Important == VO2 max is important because: * It helps doctors check how healthy someone's heart and lungs are * It can show how fit an athlete is * People with higher VO2 max values often live longer and have better health * It helps coaches and athletes plan training programs == See also == * Exercise * Physical fitness * Cardiovascular system",
