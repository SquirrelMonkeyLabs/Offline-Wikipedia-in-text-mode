 "text": "The Rio Madeira poison frog or Amazonian poison-arrow frog (Adelphobates quinquevittatus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Home== Scientists see this frog on the dead leaves on the ground in tropical rainforests. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Parque Estadual de Guajará-Mirím. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water, for example water in bromeliad plants and in the shells of Brazil nuts. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. But people cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, to dig good rocks out of the ground, and make dams for electricity. Fires can also stop the forests where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
