 "text": "Praise-God Barebone (or Barbon or Barbone) about 1598â€“1679, was an English leather-seller, and a preacher. He was influential when Oliver Cromwell ruled Britain. His name is recalled in the Barebone's Parliament of the English Commonwealth of 1653. The Commonwealth was the political structure from 1649 to 1660. England and Wales, later with Ireland and Scotland, were governed as a republic. This was after the end of the Second English Civil War, and the trial and execution of Charles I of England.Although called here Charles 1 of England, he was in fact king of Wales, Scotland and Ireland as well. Barebone was elected to the Common Council of the City of London from 1657. In 1660, Barebone endeavoured to prevent the Restoration of the English monarchy and in July, a petition he had made calling for Members of Parliament to 'deny rule by Charles II or any other single person' was reprinted in a royalist tract called The Picture of the Good Old Cause Drawn to the Life. As a result, Barebone was arrested on 25 November 1661 and charged with treason. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London but freed in July 1662 after a petition from his wife pleading his illness. Barebone died towards the end of 1679 and was buried on 5 January 1680 in the parish of St Andrew Holborn. == References == Category:1590s births Category:1679 deaths Category:Writers from London",
