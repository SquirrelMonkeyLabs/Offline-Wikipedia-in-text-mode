 "text": "The New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) was a heavy metal movement that started in the late 1970s, in Britain. It was well known around the world by the early 1980s, NWOBHM has developed underground and is the starting point for the sound of modern heavy metal. The movement developed as a reaction in part to the decline of early heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Some NWOBHM bands are Saxon, Mot√∂rhead, Diamond Head, and Iron Maiden. ==References== Category:Heavy metal Category:British music",
