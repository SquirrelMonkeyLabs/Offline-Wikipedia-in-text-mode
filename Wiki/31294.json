 "text": "Fowl are birds belonging to one of two biological orders, namely the gamefowl or landfowl (Galliformes) and the waterfowl (Anseriformes). It happens that birds in these groups are good to eat, and often hunted by gun. So the word 'fowl' may be used for a game bird. The group is mostly of birds we hunt or farm, and which we eat. Studies of anatomical and molecular similarities suggest these two groups are close evolutionary relatives. Together, they form the fowl clade, the Galloanserae.Sibley C, Ahlquist J. & Monroe B. 1988. A classification of the living birds of the world based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies. Auk 105: 409-423. This clade is also supported by morphological and DNA sequence data,Chubb A. 2004.
