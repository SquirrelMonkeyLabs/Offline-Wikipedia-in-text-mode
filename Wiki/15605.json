The population was about 5,087,000 (over 5 million) in 2004. Sicily is the biggest region in the nation of Italy. Phoenician and Greek people colonized the island in the 8th Century BC and sometimes fought wars there. Carthage controlled most of the island until Ancient Rome conquered it. In later centuries, Saracens (who significantly impacted the Island genetically and culturally) fought against the Byzantine Greeks, and Normans ruled it for a few centuries. A German dynasty and a French one ruled in the 13th century. After the 1282 revolts of Sicilian Vespers, the crown of Aragon and Spain took over the Island. Later, Garibaldi in the Risorgimento conquered it and brought it into the Kingdom of Italy. == Provinces == * Agrigento * Caltanissetta * Catania * Enna * Messina * Palermo * Ragusa * Siracusa * Trapani == Notes == : [p] \\- The word \"Sicily\" is pronounced as \"SISS-uh-lee\". == Other websites == * Official Site of Regions Sicily (Italian site) * La Sicilia In Rete Category:Islands of Italy Category:Autonomous areas",
