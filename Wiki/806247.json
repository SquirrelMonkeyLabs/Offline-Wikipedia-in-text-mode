 "text": "Lipstick feminism is a kind of feminism that originated with third wave feminism of the 1990s and 2000s. In the first two waves, feminists fought for ideas such as being able to vote in elections. Lipstick feminists still see themselves as feminists, but they also want to keep some of their attributes as women, such as their sexuality, or attractiveness. Women like Zora Neale Hurston and Emma Goldman have argued that by using philosophical ideas of aesthetics and ideas of femininity, it is possible to empower and analyze the ways that gender works in daily life. Lipstick feminists also want to use certain derogatory words, such as slut, and use them in positive ways. There is a SlutWalk movement, which fights against victim blaming in rapes.
