After being cast as the eponymous character in Disney's live action remake of Snow White, Zegler faced significant racist media backlash due to her Colombian origin. Fans on social media also reacted negatively after Zegler made comments on the original story itself, stating that she viewed the Prince as a stalker figure. During the \"Rock the City\" actors' strike, comments which occurred shortly after her Snow White controversy made her the target of the general public again. In a picket-line interview, she stated that \"if I’m gonna stand there 18 hours a day in the dress of an iconic Disney princess, I deserve to be paid for every hour that it’s streamed online.\" She received significant criticism for these comments, with people deeming her entitled or selfish. == Personal life == In February 2021, Zegler and actor Josh Andrés Rivera confirmed that they were dating. The two had met on the set of West Side Story. == References == == Other websites == * Rachel Zegler at IMDb * Rachel Zegler on YouTube * Rachel Zegler on Twitter * Rachel Zegler on Instagram Category:2001 births Category:Actors from New Jersey Category:Singers from New Jersey Category:Living people Category:People from Hackensack, New Jersey Category:Golden Globe Award winning actors Category:American movie actors Category:American YouTubers Category:American pop musicians Category:American television actors Category:Musicians from New Jersey Category:Roman Catholics",
