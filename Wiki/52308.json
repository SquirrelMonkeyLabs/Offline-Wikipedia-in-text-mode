It is located on the north side of the Ranco lake, but the town of Futrono is not on the shore. This place was a territory of mapuches indigenous. They called this town, Futronohue. Then, it becomes a port used to transport things to Puerto Nuevo, and after that to La Uni√≥n. In 1941, the municipality was created and that made it grow in population. Now, Futrono has much more activity, for example; agriculture, tourism and high quality furniture companies. Category:Cities in Chile Category:Los Lagos Region",
