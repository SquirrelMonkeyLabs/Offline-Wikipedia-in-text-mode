 "text": "Casville Records (often stylized as Ca$hville Records) is an independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee. It was started by rapper Young Buck in 2006. It was originally called G-Unit South. However, since Buck and 50 Cent had engaged in a feud while Buck was signed to G-Unit Records, he was kicked out and had to change the label's name because he could no longer use the G-Unit logo to distribute his music. Its artists are gangsta rap or southern rap musicians. It has so far signed acts such as Outlaws and Lil Scrappie and is currently being distributed by RED distribution. == Other websites == * Official website Category:American record labels Category:2006 establishments in the United States",
