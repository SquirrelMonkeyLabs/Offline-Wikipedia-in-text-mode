 "text": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is a technology related to Frequency Division Multiplexing. With it, many different signals can be sent over the same medium, at the same time. Each signal uses a different basis function. By using the basis function given, the sender and recipient will then see their signal better, the other signals will be clearly separated. == Advantages and disadvantages == === Advantages === * Can adapt easily to bad channels (noisy,etc.) * Robust against crosstalk between channels that are close together. * Robust against Intersymbol interference (ISI) and fading caused by multipath propagation * High spectral efficiency * There are good implementations available * Few problems with errors that come from time synchornization * Tuned sub-channel receiver filters are not required (unlike conventional FDM) * Facilitates Single Frequency Networks, i.e. transmitter macrodiversity. === Disadvantages === * Problems with Doppler shift. * Synchronizing frequencies can be problematic * Sensitive to frequency synchronization problems. * High peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR). This needs linear transmission circuits; they need a lot of power. * Loss of efficiency caused by Cyclic prefix/Guard interval == Uses == Many technologies use OFDM. Among them are: * ADSL and VDSL * Power line communication * Wireless LAN, namely 802.11a,g, and n, and HiperLAN/2 (802.11b uses Direct- sequence spread spectrum) * 4G LTE mobile networks use OFDMA (OFDM multi-users variant) * Some Digital radio systems * Some Digital TV systems, most notably DVB-T Category:Radio technology",
