During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Skakun's was sent to protect the town of Henichesk. As the Russian military got close to the town, Ukrainian forces decided to destroy the Henichesk bridge, in order to slow the Russian troops advancing northward from Crimea. Skakun, a combat engineer, volunteered to place mines on the bridge. On 24 February 2022, after placing the explosives, Skakun did not have enough time to leave from the bridge and, after texting his soldiers, blew up the mines killing himself and destroying the bridge. His actions slowed the Russian military. On 26 February 2022, Skakun was posthumously awarded the Order of the Gold Star, the military version of the title of Hero of Ukraine, by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ==References== Category:1996 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Ukrainian military people Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Category:Marine engineers Category:People from Ternopil Oblast",
