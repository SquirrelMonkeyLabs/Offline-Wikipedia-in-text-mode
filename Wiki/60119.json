 "text": "The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 to September 2, 1945) was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. It became part of World War II when Japan entered that war on the side of the Axis powers. Part of the Sino-Japanese war was fought in northern Myanmar and northeastern India. The war ended when Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It started in 1937, 43 years after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894, led by Emperor Meiji who was the Grandfather of Hirohito. == Invasion of China == The Second Sino-Japanese War began when Japan invaded China in 1931. Japan used the Mukden Incident as an excuse to invade China. The invasion grew into a full-scale war in 1937 after the Marco- Polo Bridge Incident. Japanese officers said a Japanese soldier got lost, and they were allowed to find him in Beiping (now called Beijing). Japan invaded China for a few reasons: * Japan needed more and more raw materials to create its heavy industry and intended to get them by taking over more of Asia * The Japanese military, and Japanese nationalism, were becoming stronger and more popular While the Imperial Japanese Army was trying to take over China, the KMT (the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CPC (Communist Party of China under Mao Zedong) cooperated a little to try to fight off Japan together. This was called the \"Chinese United Front\". However, for the most part, they continued to fight each other as well. === Japanese occupation of China === In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army began to occupy China, starting in the northeast (Manchuria), where they created a puppet state called Manchukuo. In 1937, they occupied Beijing and then Nanjing. For six weeks in Nanjing, the army committed the Nanjing Massacre. During this massacre, Japanese soldiers killed between 40,000 and 300,000 Chinese people, and raped at least 20,000 women and girls.Judgment (English Translation): Chapter VIII, Conventional War Crimes (Atrocities). International Military Tribunal for the Far East. p. 1012, 1015. November 1, 1948. Retrieved April 14, 2016. After six weeks, the Japanese Army left Nanjing. It finally occupied southern China's industrial cities. Chiang moved his capital city from Nanjing to Chongqing, and began a tactic of \"using space to trade for time.\" He was able to spread Japanese soldiers out too thin. This means they were covering too much space with too few soldiers. This made them harder to fight and made it easier for partisans to fight back in occupied China. Many soldiers died on both sides at this time. However, in 1940, the Japanese Army stopped being able to move farther into China and take more land. 1940 also marked the point where China began to be able to fight back instead of Japan continuing to take over the country. == End of the war 1941-1945 == After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 7, 1941, the Second Sino-Japanese War became part of World War II. It became a part of the fighting area called the China-Burma- India theatre. The entrance of the United States into the war in Asia meant that the Chinese military forces started receiving lend-lease supplies from the British and Americans over the Burma Road. This helped the Chinese fight back and get much-needed modern weapons. The Second Sino-Japanese War had damaged Japan. Instead of quickly winning the war, Japan's military had already fought China for four years. This made it much more difficult for Japan to keep fighting (now in the Pacific against the Allied forces). This may have been one reason why Japan eventually lost the war. In China, the war had some important effects. It increased support for the Chinese Communist Party and caused Chiang's Republic to fall apart more quickly in 1949. == Related pages == * Empire of Japan ** Imperial Japanese Army ** Attack on Pearl Harbor ** Nanjing Massacre * Republic of China ** Chiang Kai-Shek * People's Republic of China ** Mao Zedong == References == == Other websites == * WW2DB: Second Sino-Japanese War Category:Second Sino-Japanese War Category:Wars involving Japan Category:Wars involving China",
