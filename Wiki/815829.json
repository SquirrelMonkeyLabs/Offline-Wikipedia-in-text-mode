 "text": "Alabama's 2nd congressional district is a United States congressional district in Alabama that elects a representative to the United States House of Representatives. Since 2025, it includes most of the Montgomery metropolitan area and the city of Mobile. The district has parts of Clarke and Mobile counties and all of Barbour, Bullock, Butler, Conecuh, Crenshaw, Macon, Monroe, Montgomery, Pike, Russell, and Washington counties. The district is represented by Democrat Shomari Figures since 2025. The district was changed for the 2024 election because of a US Supreme Court case. The court decided that the Alabama's earlier districts were illegal, because they discriminated against Black Americans. Before this, from 2021 to 2025, Republican Barry Moore represented the 2nd district. ==Election history== Year Office Results 2000 President Bush 61 - 38% 2004 President Bush 67 - 33% 2008 President McCain 63 - 36% 2012 President Romney 63 - 36% 2016 President Trump 65 - 33% ==References== 02",
