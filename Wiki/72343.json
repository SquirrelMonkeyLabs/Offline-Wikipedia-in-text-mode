 "text": "A personal union is a relationship of two or more sovereign states, which, through law, share the same person as their head of state. Personal unions can begin for very different reasons. In many cases a princess who is already married to a king becomes pregnant, and their child inherits the crown of both countries. However, a personal union sometimes was seen as a means against uprisings if a state wants an annexation of an other state. The unions can be written down in a constitution, which clearly expresses that both states shall share the same person as head of state. When that is not the case, a personal union can easily be broken. == Some examples == === Andorra === * Partial personal union with France since 1607 (the French president, and formerly the king of France, is one of the Heads of State in Andorra, the other co-head of state is the Bishop of La Seu d'Urgell, Catalonia, Spain.) === Belgium === Personal union with the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908, when it annexed the Congo Free State. === Bohemia === * Personal union with Poland 1003 - 1004 (Bohemia occupied by Poles) * Personal union with Poland 1300 - 1306 and Hungary 1301 - 1305 (Wenceslas II and Wenceslas III) * Personal union with Luxembourg 1313 - 1378 and 1383 - 1388 * Personal union with Hungary 1419-1439 (Sigismund of Luxemburg and his son in law) and 1490 - 1526 (Jagellon dynasty) * Personal union with Austria and Hungary 1526 - 1918 (except years 1619 - 1620) === Brandenburg === * Personal union with the Duchy of Prussia from 1618, when Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia died without male heirs and his son in law John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg became ruler of both countries. Brandenburg and Prussia maintained separate governments and seats of power in Berlin and Königsberg respectively until 1701, when Frederick William I consolidated them into one government. === Congo Free State === Personal union with Belgium from 1885 to 1908, when Belgium annexed it. === Australia === * Since 1941, upon the ratification of the Westminster Statute in 1942 - which ended the British Parliament's ability to legislate for Australia.
