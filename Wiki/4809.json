 "text": "The list of countries by area is the list of the world's countries and their territories by total area. ==Overview== The inputs are realized according to the ISO 3166 standard which includes sovereign states and dependent territories. The 193 Members of the United Nations and the two observer states are numbered. Countries which enjoy limited recognition forming part of the international community and not found in ISO 3166 are also included in the list, but their areas also generally count with the areas of other widely recognized states which claim the following territory. ==Areas== The areas claimed by individual countries, such as the areas of Antarctica, are not realized as well. The list doesn't include supranational entities such as the European Union. The entry includes three subfields: * Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and coastlines. * Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) * Water area is the sum of the surfaces of all inland water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, or rivers, as delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Coastal internal waters may be included. Territorial seas are not included unless otherwise noted. Contiguous zones and Exclusive Economic Zones are not included. Make sure that there are many country size comparisons which would not match all these countries area. The areas that appear in the table for each country are taken from the United Nations Statistics Division unless otherwise noted. == Map == ===Countries and territories by area=== Country / dependency Total in km² (mi²) Land in km² (mi²) Water in km² (mi²) % of water Earth 50.0 Water 100.0 Land 0.0 2.0 Antarctica 0.0 4.0 / 2.5 1.5 1.0 1.0 2.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.0 (Denmark) 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5 1.5 1.0 0.0 1.0 Marie Byrd Land (terra nullius) 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 1.0 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.3 (metropolitan) 0.5 0.0 0 3.0 2.0 3.5 4.0 4.0 1.5 (France) 0.0 1.5 1.5 0.4 0.7 0.7 0.6 0 0.9 0.8 0 (mainland) 1.2 0.2 70 71 72 73 74 75 0.4 0.5 78 79 0 80 81 82 0.7 83 84 0.8 86 87 88 89 91 92 93 94 95 0.8 97 0.1 99 0.9 100 1.3 102 103 104 105 106 0.1 108 0.2 109 110 – 111 112 0 114 115 116 117 – (France) 0.3 119 120 121 0 0 123 124 125 – (Norway) 126 128 0 130 131 132 2.4 136 137 0.6 0.3 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 0.1 152 153 154 155 156 (France) 0 0 158 159 160 161 0.2 0 0 (United Kingdom) 0 0 164 165 0.2 167 168 0 – (United States) 170 171 – 172 173 174 – (France) 175 176 – (United Kingdom) 177 178 179 – (China) 180 – (France) – Bir Tawil (Terra nullius) 181 182 – (France) – (Finland) – (Denmark) – (France) – (New Zealand) 183 – (United Kingdom) 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 – (New Zealand) – (United Kingdom) – (United States) 191 – (United States) 192 193 – (Netherlands) 193 194 – (Australia) 195 – (Norway) – (France) – (United States) 196 – (South Africa) 197 – (United Kingdom) 198 – (Netherlands) – (United Kingdom) 199 200 – (United Kingdom) – (France) 201 – (United States) 202 – (Netherlands) – (Chile) 203 – (Norway) – (United States) – (France) – (Australia) – (Australia) – (United Kingdom) – (New Zealand) – (United Kingdom) – (United Kingdom) – (United Kingdom) 204 – (United Kingdom) – (France) – (United Kingdom) – (Colombia) – (Norway) – (United Kingdom) – (Australia) – (Netherlands) – (New Zealand) – (China) 205 – (New Zealand) 206 – (France) – (Netherlands) – (Spain) – (Australia) – (Netherlands) – (Spain) – (New Zealand) – (disputed) – (United Kingdom) – (United Kingdom) – (France) – (Australia) – (disputed) – (New Zealand) – (terra nullius) – (New Zealand) – (Australia) 207 – (New Zealand) 208 == Graphical charts == The following charts are based on the CIA World Factbook, of which these charts will show how big is the area.
