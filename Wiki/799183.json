Two Philadelphia Police Department officers arrived in the area to respond to a domestic dispute. When they arrived, Wallace was getting close to them while holding a knife. The two officers backed away while asking him to put down the knife, but Wallace walked closer. Each officer fired several rounds at Wallace in the shoulder and chest. He later died in the hospital. Wallace's family said he was having a mental health crisis. In response to the killing, protests happened throughout Philadelphia on October 26 and 27, many of which became violent, leading to arrests, injuries to police, and deployment of the Pennsylvania National Guard. ==References== Category:2020 in the United States Category:2020s in Philadelphia Category:October 2020 events Category:People shot and killed by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Deaths by person in the United States",
