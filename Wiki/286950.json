 "text": "Theodore James \"TJ\" Wilson (born July 11, 1980), also known by his ring name Tyson Kidd, is a Canadian retired professional wrestler that currently works for the WWE as a producer, after retiring from in-ring competition in 2017. Wilson is from Calgary, Alberta and was the final graduate of the famed Hart Dungeon. He competed in his first match with Stampede Wrestling in Calgary at the age of fifteen in 1995. In the WWE, he was a former member of the wrestling stable, The Hart Dynasty along with David Hart Smith and Natalya. He is a three-time tag team champion (two-time WWE Tag Team Champion with Smith and Cesaro and one-time World Tag Team Champion with Smith, which was the last reign of this title). He married Natalya in June 2013. On June 7, 2015, it was announced that Wilson suffered a severe neck and spinal injury in a dark match with Samoa Joe on Raw. Wilson announced that he would be out for over a year. Wilson tweeted that 5% of people are able to survive his injury and that he had 16 staples, 4 screws and a rod inserted in his neck. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter said \"It is unbelievable that Tyson Kidd came through as well as he did\", and said that most people who survive the injury end up being a quadriplegic. == Championships and accomplishments == * AWA Pinnacle Wrestling ** AWA Pinnacle Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **AWA Washington Heavyweight Championship (1 time) * Florida Championship Wrestling ** FCW Florida Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with DH Smith ** FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship (2 times) * Great Canadian Wrestling ** GCW National Championship (1 time) * Major League Wrestling ** GTC Carnival Tournament (2004) – with Harry Smith * Prairie Wrestling Alliance ** PWA Championship (2 times) ** PWA Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Harry Smith * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** Ranked No. 53 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2015 * Stampede Wrestling ** Stampede British Commonwealth Mid- Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ** Stampede International Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Bruce Hart (1) and Juggernaut (1) **Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship (2 times) * World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE ** World Tag Team Championship (1 time, last) – with David Hart Smith ** WWE Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with David Hart Smith (1) and Cesaro (1) ** Bragging Rights Trophy (2009) – with Team SmackDown (Chris Jericho, Kane, Matt Hardy, R-Truth, Finlay and David Hart Smith) * Wrestling Observer Newsletter ** Most Underrated (2012) *Canadian Wrestling Hall of Fame **Class of 2016 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1980 births Category:Canadian professional wrestlers Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Calgary Category:WWE people",
