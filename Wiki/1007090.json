The Mōri clan was a group of Japanese samurai that originated from Ōe no Hiromoto, who was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan. One of their most famous members, Mōri Motonari, greatly increased the clan's influence in Aki Province. During the Edo period, Motonari's descendants became daimyō (feudal lords) of the Chōshū Domain under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate.
