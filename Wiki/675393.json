 "text": "Landing craft are small or medium sized boats made to land at a beach. They help military troops move from their transport ships to the beach, when they cannot use a port. They are also used to deliver supplies and vehicles for troops. To get onto a beach, the landing craft has to be flat-bottomed. The lack of a proper keel makes them uncomfortable in rough seas. World War II had many invasions from the sea including Operation Overlord. Landing craft were less used in earlier and later wars. Category:Ship types",
