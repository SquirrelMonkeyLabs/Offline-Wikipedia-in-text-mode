Each member country keeps a special office. The name of this office in every member country is National Central Bureau (NCB). If necessary, Interpol contacts this office for getting information or for any other action. In turn, the National Central Bureau gets in touch with Interpol (on behalf of the member country) to ask for any assistance. Interpol also has collected a large amount of data about perpetrators and crimes. Such data includes information about illegal drug trade, lost and stolen passports and visas.
