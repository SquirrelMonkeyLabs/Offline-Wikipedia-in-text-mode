 "text": "The Division of Illawarra was as a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. It covered part of the Illawarra region which it was named after. The division was created in 1900. It was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. It was abolished in the redistributions that happened in 1922. The most famous member elected for the division was George Fuller who was a minister under Alfred Deakin. After losing the division in the 1913 Federal election, Fuller would be elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly where he would hold the seat of Wollondilly. Fuller would later become the Premier of New South Wales two times. His first term as Premier was only seven hours on 20 December 1921 which is the shortest serving ministry in Australian history. ==Members== Image Member Party George Fuller Free Trade 1901–1906 George Fuller Anti-Socialist 1906 –1909 George Fuller Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1913 George Burns Labor 1913–1917 Hector Lamond Nationalist 1917–1922 Illawarra Category:1901 establishments in Australia Category:1920s disestablishments in Australia",
