 "text": "Assamese ( ; romanized: Ôxômiya) () is the easternmost Indo-Aryan language, spoken most in the state of Assam in North-East India. It is also the main language of Assam. It is spoken in parts of Arunachal Pradesh and other northeast Indian states. Assamese culture is deeply intertwined with the language, and it serves as a significant marker of Assamese identity. The language has borrowed vocabulary from various sources, including Sanskrit, Persian, and English, due to historical influences and interactions. Assamese literature has produced renowned writers such as Lakshminath Bezbaroa, Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, and Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya, who have made significant contributions to both regional and Indian literature. In recent years, efforts have been made to promote and preserve the Assamese language and its cultural heritage, both within the state of Assam and among Assamese communities across the globe. == References == Category:Indo-Aryan languages Category:Languages of Bangladesh Category:Assam Category:Languages of India",
