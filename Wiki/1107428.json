 "text": "Middleport Pottery is a building in Middleport, Stoke-on-Trent. Burgess & Leigh Ltd built it in 1888. It was one of the potteries which were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries in Stoke, England. Today, the buildings are protected, because of their historical interest. It still houses an active pottery. Middleport Pottery is now owned and operated by Re-Form Heritage. Notice its situation beside a canal. All the goods from the potteries were sent out by water because they were so heavy. Category:Pottery Category:Buildings and structures in England by type",
