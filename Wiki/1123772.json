 "text": "Blondi (1941 â€“ 29 April 1945) was a German Shepherd dog. She was owned and trained by Adolf Hitler. Hitler was given Blondi by Chief of the Party Chancellery Martin Bormann when Blondi was still a puppy. Hitler and the Nazi party used Blondi as a propaganda tool to make Hitler look more likeable and appear as someone who loves animals. Sometime in early 1945, Blondi would have 5 puppies with Harras, the German Shepard of Gerdy Troost. Hitler trained one of her puppies named Wulf. When he was planning on commiting his suicide, Hitler was given cyanide pills from Heinrich Himmler. Hitler did not trust Himmler at this time and did not trust the effectiveness of the pills. He had his Dr. Werner Haase test the pill on Blondi. Blondi would die from this and Hitler would be very sad about it. After Blondie's death, Hitler ordered that her puppies and Eva Braun's two Scottish Terriers also be shot and killed so that they did not fall into the hands of the Soviet Red Army. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Individual dogs Category:Pets of world leaders Category:Adolf Hitler",
