 "text": "Garlic knots are a type of bread with garlic. They are usually found in pizza places around the New York City and in other areas. They were first made in 1973 by people who wanted to use pastry left over from cooking pizza. Traditionally, bread dough is used to make garlic knots. The dough is pre- baked in a pizza oven after being rolled and then pulled into tiny, snug overhand knots. After that, the knots are either dipped in or liberally coated with a mixture of oil, Parmesan cheese, and crushed garlic; other toppings include black pepper, dry oregano, or finely chopped parsley. Garlic knots are roasted twice before serving and can be served with marinara sauce. Category:Appetizers Category:Breads",
