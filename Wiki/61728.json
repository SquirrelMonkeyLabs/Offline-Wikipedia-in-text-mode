 "text": "Santorini is an archipelago in the Aegean Sea. It is about north of Crete. The archipelago is made of five islands, Thira, Thirassia, Aspronissi, Palea, and Nea Kameni in the southern Cyclades. Its volcano is among the few still active in Greece and Europe. These islands formed through intense volcanic activity, with twelve major eruptions happening roughly every 20,000 years. Each eruption caused the central part of the volcano to collapse, creating a large crater called a caldera. Despite this, the volcano repeatedly rebuilt itself. The biggest of these is also called Santorini. Other names for the archipelago, and the island are Thera or Thira. The archipelago formed around a caldera. 13.600 people live there. The island has been settled for a long time, there are archeologial sites dating to Minoan times, and to the paleolithic. The volcano erupted around 1500 BC, and may have wiped out the Minoan culture there. The island was later resettled. == Santorini coasts == Santorini's east coast is not as famous as its celebrated, higher West coast. Here, the heights along the caldera edge gently slope down to the sea, creating volcanic-sand beaches and resorts with a different charm. Resorts like Kamari and Perissa offer a more traditional and affordable island holiday experience, with beaches filled with sun loungers, water sports, and promenades lined with bars and tavernas. The East coast's beaches are known for their black sand, while the South coast boasts a series of beaches famous for their multi-colored sand. The striking Red Beach is particularly popular among travelers. ==References== Category:Wine regions Category:Calderas Category:Volcanoes of Europe Category:Islands of Greece",
