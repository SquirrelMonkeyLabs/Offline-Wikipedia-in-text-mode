 "text": "Ike Turner (November 5, 1931 – December 12, 2007) was an American singer, songwriter and recording artist. He recorded many hit records, most of which were done with his wife Tina Turner. He was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, although he later moved to St. Louis, Missouri then to California. He recorded “Rocket 88” a hit in 1951 for Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats. Brenston was Turner's saxophonist and the Delta Cats were actually Turner's Kings of Rhythm back-up band. Some people think this was the first rock and roll record. He died of an accidental cocaine overdose in San Diego. == Other websites == * ==References== Category:African-American musicians Category:American R&B; musicians Category:Drug-related accidental deaths in the United States Category:Singers from Mississippi Category:1931 births Category:2007 deaths",
