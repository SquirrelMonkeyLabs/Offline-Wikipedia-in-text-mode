 "text": "Sodom and Gomorrah are two ancient cities mentioned in the Book of Genesis. Both cities were destroyed by fire from God because of their gluttony and wickedness as shown in the passage “Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom, she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it.” Ezekiel 16:49-50 Some scholars believe that the cities were in Moab, east of the southern edge of the Dead Sea. IVP New Bible Commentary map, pp 75 The word sodomy (anal sex) is derived from Sodom. The story of Sodom and Gomorrah was made into a movie in 1963. == In Genesis 18-19== God tells Abraham He plans to destroy Sodom because of its wickedness. Abraham gets God to promise to spare it if ten good men can be found. Lot, Abraham's relative, lives in Sodom. He is visited by two angels who appeared to Lot as human men. An interpretation by some scholars is that the men of Sodom want to have anal sex with these visitors. Lot refuses to allow this. He offers the Sodomites his two virgin daughters instead. The men decline the offer. They storm Lot's door. The angels rescue Lot. They tell Lot that God has sent them to destroy Sodom for its wickness and self interest. They order Lot to gather his family, and leave the city. They forbid Lot or any of his family to look upon the city during its destruction. Lot and his family flee. Lot's wife looks back at the city. She is turned into a pillar of salt. ==References== Category:Cities in Asia Category:Old Testament",
