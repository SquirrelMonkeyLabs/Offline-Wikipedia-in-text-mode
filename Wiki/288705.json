 "text": "Micronations are countries started by one or a group of people which are not seen as actual countries by the United Nations. Some of these countries are mostly on the internet or exist in a physical location but are not serious states with legitimate reason to exist. Some are taken seriously and even exist for legitimate reasons but are not recognized as independent countries for various political and diplomatic reasons. It is important to note that micronations are different from partially-recognised countries and separatist territories, which often have full autonomy over their territories. People make micronations for lots of reasons. Some are to show they do not like their main country (for example the United Kingdom), or if they want to make money, or to use it as a place for themselves. Some want a different kind of government than their country currently has, such as a micronationalist declaring independence from USA to build a tiny communist or socialist state. Micronations create their own rules, but because they are not recognised as actual countries, they have to keep within the laws of their home country. Some of the more famous micronations include the Republic of Molossia, the Islamic Sultanate of Qarsherskiy, Sealand, the Aerican Empire, Eternia and Khilafat e Isakhelistan. ==List== Here is a list of some Micronations; Name Flag Made on Description Website Khilafatle Isakhelistan 15 April 2024 The Khilafat e Isakhelistan was formed as a result of the dissolution of the Shabbiristan and is a micronation in Pakistan (Not a separatist movement).
