 "text": "The East India Docks were a group of docks in Blackwall, East London, England, north-east of the Isle of Dogs. Today only the entrance basin and the perimeter wall are still visible. The dock Basin was gradually extended and new locks built, but the 20th century saw the decline of the London docklands and the East India Docks closed in 1967. The Basin was turned into a nature reserve by the London Docklands Development Corporation and has been in the ownership of Lee Valley Regional Park Authority since 1998. ==History== Following the successful creation of the West India Docks, which opened in 1802, an Act of Parliament in 1803 set up The East India Dock Company, promoted by the British East India Company. == References == Category:Ports and harbours of the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets",
