 "text": "Hu Jintao (born 21 December 1942) is a Chinese politician who was the paramount leader of China and the 8th General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 2002 to 2012. Hu Jintao also served as the 6th President of China from 2003 to 2013 and the 5th and 12th Chairman of the Central Military Commission from 2004 to 2012. Hu was born on 21 December 1942 in Taizhou, Jiangsu. Hu left office of General Secretary on 15 November 2012 and the office was taken by Xi Jinping. Hu was educated as a hydraulic engineer from Tsinghua University in 1965. According to official biographies, he has a photographic memory. Politically, he is moderate and careful. He spent most of his previous career in Tibet and the poorer provinces, and was therefore unknown to Western analysts until he unexpectedly became the General Secretary (paramount leader). Even as a general secretary, he was quite private - and so has never given an interview. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:General Secretaries of the Communist Party of China Category:Presidents of the People's Republic of China Category:Politicians from Jiangsu Category:21st-century Chinese politicians",
