 "text": "Buddha is Blink-182's 1998 album release and the last album to feature the original drummer Scott Raynor before being replaced by current drummer Travis Barker. Buddha is a mostly fast paced album if you mainly listen to modern Blink-182, but it definitely shows where they got their roots from, containing many off-beats whilst maintaining a fast tempo with breaks for pre-emo emo bouts.
