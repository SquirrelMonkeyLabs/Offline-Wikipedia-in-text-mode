It spreads across Večićko polje (Večići's field), nearby the mouth of Cvrcka (in Vrbanja river), and Vrbanjci, a larger village. In 1991 its population was 1744. In 2013 it was 797, all of whom are Bosniaks. During the Bosnian War, the village was a pocket of Bosniak resistance against the Bosnian Serb Army and Police forces. It suffered severe damages, including destruction of the village mosque. The anthropologist Madelyn Iris noted that Some of the villagers died in a massacre at nearby Grabovica in November 1992 and 150-200 men and boys were killed in the village school. As of 2017 these people are still on the list of missing persons.Fena, Agencija (2013): Obilježavanje 21. godišnjice stradanja Bošnjaka u Kotor-Varoši – Još se traži 277 osoba.
