The female is a reddish-brown bird with brownish barred buff below. The superb bird-of-paradise lives in the rainforests of New Guinea. The male is polygamous and performs a song and dance for to gain the interest of the female. He starts by singing loud and rapid notes, then he starts to hop around in front of the female making a tapping or clicking sound.
