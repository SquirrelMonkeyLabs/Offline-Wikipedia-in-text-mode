 "text": "High-definition television (HDTV) is a television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television. With HDTV, people can see sharper pictures than with old television, giving a more vivid and clear screen. Most HDTV systems use digital signals with a 16:9 aspect ratio (width to height). This is different to SDTV (standard-definition television) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio. HDTV picture resolution is at least twice that of the SDTV of the 20th century, so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or DVD. HDTV can control resolution efficiently. Many videos on the website YouTube, a free video sharing app that lets people upload and view videos, are in 1080p60 HDR and 1440p60 HDR. There are different standards. Common ones are: *2560×1440, progressive scan, requiring about 3,68 Megapixels per frame. This is known as 1440p or WQHD. It became commonplace in the 2010s. It is slowly replacing many 1080p-computer- monitors in the everyday use and is a YouTube HD standard. *1920×1080, progressive scan, requiring about 2,07 MPixels per frame. This is known as 1080p. It has been used very frequently for different types of screens in the 21st century and is a TV broadcasting standard. As a comparison, PAL+ is at 1024x576 pixels, and NTSC at 853x480 pixels. == Other websites == * US Government HDTV and DTV official site * Canadian Digital Television official website * ATSC Category:Television technology",
