 "text": "The Canadian Shield, also called the Laurentian Plateau (French: ), is a large area of exposed Precambrian, igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. The geological shield is the ancient geological core of the North American continent (Laurentia, also called the North American Craton). A continuation of the Canadian Shield is in western Greenland to which it was once connected. In the United States, most of the Canadian Shield is covered with much younger rocks and sediment. The Canadian Shield around Hudson Bay is covered with shallow soil. Its main industrial use is mining. ==References== Category:Geography of North America",
