Other actors in the show were Bitty Schram, Jason Gray-Stanford, Ted Levine and Traylor Howard. ==Storyline== Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) had been a good detective for the San Francisco police department. After his wife Trudy was killed by a car bomb, Monk had a nervous breakdown. He was too upset and afraid to work. He was then let go by the police department. After that he stayed inside his house for many years. He finally began to go outside his house; but only with the help of his nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram). He could only go places when she went with him to protect him from his fears. This let him do some work as a private detective. He still has a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sometimes, the obsessive-compulsive disorder helps him figure out the answers to clues in cases. He has a great memory for details. Since he was a child, Monk has been able to notice small things that others miss. Monk has to have everything clean and spends a lot of his day cleaning over and over. He also has a fear of germs.Mark Crawford, The Obsessive Compulsive Trap: Real Help for a Real Struggle (Ventura, CA: Regal Books, 2004), p. 29 He cleans his toothbrush with boiling water. He vacuums his walls and ceilings in his home. Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Randall \"Randy\" Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) ask Monk for detective help when they can't figure out a crime scene. Stottlemeyer is usually frustrated by Monk's idiosyncrasies. But he respects Monk's amazing crime solving abilities. When Monk is not working, he tries to solve his wife's murder.Lee Siegel, Not Remotely Controlled: Notes on Television (New York: Basic Books, 2007), p. 38 He often works on cases that involve women or bombs, because it reminds him of his wife. In the middle of Season 3, Monk's nurse, Sharona Fleming, decides to move back to New Jersey. Monk then hires another assistant. Her name is Natalie Teeger (played by Traylor Howard). Natalie has a daughter named Julie Teeger. Her husband was in the United States Navy and was killed in combat years earlier. == Other websites == * Official website * Monk on IMDb == References == Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2009 American television series endings Category:2000s American television series Category:2000s comedy television series Category:2000s drama television series Category:2000s mystery television series Category:American comedy-drama television series Category:American crime drama television series Category:American mystery television series Category:Mental disorders in fiction Category:Television series set in San Francisco Category:English-language television programs",
