 "text": "The Memorial 1714 is a civic and cultural association dedicated to preserving and disseminating the history of Catalonia. Its main focus is on the events surrounding the siege of Barcelona in 1714, a critical moment in the history of Catalonia. With its voluntary effort, the 1714 Memorial keeps the flame of Catalonia's history alive at Fossar de les Moreres. == Social siege == The headquarters are located in Fossar de les Moreres, given that the center of the association's work is closely related to this historic place in Barcelona. This memorial commemorates those who died defending the Constitutions and freedoms of Catalonia during the War of Succession. The outcome of the conflict led to the disappearance of the Catalan State and left the Catalan Nation vulnerable to Bourbon absolutism. == Objectives == The association aims to: # Disseminating the Catalan reality : Making known the national reality of Catalonia and its geographical context. # Educate about history : Foster understanding and awareness of Catalan history, especially the War of Succession and its consequences == Activities == The 1714 Memorial organizes several activities: # Days : Five key dates with civic, patriotic and educational content. # Exhibitions : Visual shows that contribute to historical recovery. # Publications : journals, manifestos and books that share research and knowledge. == Books == * Barcelona 1713, capital d'un Estat.
