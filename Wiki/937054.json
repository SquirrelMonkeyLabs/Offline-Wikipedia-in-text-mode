Now Campion is a ghost town. Nobody lives there. Campion was named after Sir William Campion. He was the Governor of Western Australia from 1924 to 1931. Retired soldiers started the town as part of a soldier settlement scheme. They built a school in 1925 and a railway siding in 1927. The siding was used until 1957. The \"Emu War\" of 1932 happened in Campion. ==References== *Ghost Towns Starting With 'C' *Campion, Western Australia Category:Ghost towns in Australia",
