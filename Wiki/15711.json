As soon as Kevin \"Noodles\" Wasserman joined the band as their second guitarist in 1985, they changed their name to \"The Offspring\". It would not be until ten years after forming that The Offspring saw its first piece of commercial success in its third album, Smash, which was released in 1994. Regarded by many as The Offspring's classic release, and Epitaph Records' best-selling album, Smash produced four successful hit singles: \"Come Out and Play\" (which reached #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart), \"Self Esteem\", \"Gotta Get Away\" and the radio-only single \"Bad Habit\". From there, The Offspring became one of the most important punk bands of the 1990s, along with ALL, Bad Religion, Face to Face, Green Day, Guttermouth, Lagwagon, NOFX, Pennywise, Rancid, Social Distortion, The Vandals, and many others. Their most recent album was released October 11, 2024. == Discography == * The Offspring (1989) * Baghdad (1991, EP) * Ignition (1992) * Smash (1994) * Ixnay on the Hombre (1997) * Americana (1998) * Conspiracy of One (2000) * Splinter (2003) * Greatest Hits (2005, compilation) * Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace (2008) * Days Go By (2012) *Let the Bad Times Roll (2021) *Supercharged (2024) == References == Category:1984 establishments in the United States Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American punk bands Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Musical groups from Huntington Beach, California",
