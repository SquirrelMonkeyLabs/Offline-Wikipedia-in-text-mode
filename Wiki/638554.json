 "text": "Lophorhothon (Langston, 1960) is a genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous, the first genus of dinosaur discovered in Alabama, in the United States. == Discovery and naming == Remains of this small, poorly known perhaps saurolophine dinosaur were first discovered during the 1940s, from extensive erosional outcrops of the lower unnamed member of the Mooreville Chalk Formation in Dallas County, west of the town of Selma, Alabama. == Taxonomic status == A number of workers have questioned the validity of L. atopus. It may have been a premature Prosaurolophus. == Holotype == The holotype specimen was likely washed out to sea by a river, where it eventually sank and was buried in the silty carbonate sediments of Alabama. == Sources == * Horner, J.
