 "text": "A Perforated baton, or baton de commandement, is an artefact from paleolithic times. There are debates as to what the artefact could have been used for. These artefacts were quite comomnplace, most have been found in the south of France. They have been dated to the mesolithic. They were usually made from the antlers of reindeer, or of other game animals. Some have argued that the function was purely ceremonial, but others think that this was a tool. One thing this could have been used for is to straighten arrows. Category:Tools Category:Stone Age",
