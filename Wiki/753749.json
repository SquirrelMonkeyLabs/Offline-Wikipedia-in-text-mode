 "text": "The United States of Africa is a hypothetical plan for a federation of some or all of the 55 sovereign states on the continent of Africa. The concept takes its origin from Marcus Garvey's 1924 poem \"Hail, United States of Africa\". Key supporters of the plan were Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
