 "text": "A baby shower is an event held before the birth of a child. It is done about two months before the calculated birth date. Very often, only female friends of the future mother are invited. They usually bring small presents for the mother or the child. The current trend to hold baby showers comes from the United States. Baby parties were already known in Ancient Greece. Amphidromia was a feast that happened about five days after birth: It was done to ritually make the newborn a member of the family. Category:Ceremonies Category:Pregnancy and childbirth",
