 "text": "Baskin-Robbins is an international chain of ice cream parlors. It has franchises in more than 30 countries. Out of 5800 locations, 2800 are based in the United States. It was founded in 1953 by the merger of two separate ice cream ventures of Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins, who were brothers-in-law. Before the merger, the two separate ice cream ventures were called Burt’s Ice Cream Shop and Snowbird Ice Cream. Snowbird Ice cream had 21 flavors at the time, which was praised as novel and fresh. After the two ventures were combined into Baskin-Robbins, which would later become a world-famous ice cream parlor, they pushed the slogan of \"31 flavors.\" Baskin-Robbins was creative in its approach, introducing the sampling system—letting people taste the different flavors of ice cream with small, single-use pink plastic spoons until they find the flavor that they want. Also, Baskin-Robbins was the first to introduce the ice cream cake to the public. ==Original 31 Flavors== The original flavors when Baskin-Robbins first opened in 1945 were: * Banana Nut Fudge * Black Walnut * Burgundy Cherry * Butterscotch Ribbon * Cherry Macaron * Chocolate * Chocolate Almond * Chocolate Chip * Chocolate Fudge * Chocolate Mint * Chocolate Ribbon * Coffee * Coffee Candy * Date Nut * Eggnog * French Vanilla * Green Mint Stick * Lemon Crisp * Lemon Custard * Lemon Sherbet * Maple Nut * Orange Sherbet * Peach * Peppermint Fudge Ribbon * Peppermint Stick * Pineapple Sherbet * Raspberry Sherbet * Rocky Road Nut * Strawberry * Vanilla * Vanilla Burnt Almond ==Current Flavors== *Mint Chocolate *Love Potion #31 *Chocolate *Oreo Cookies 'n' Cream *Chocolate Chip *Pralines 'n' Cream *Very Berry Strawberry *Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough *Old Fashioned Butter Pecan *Jamoca Almond *Mousse Royale *Peanut Butter Cup *Strawberry *Peanut Butter 'n' Chocolate *Gold Medal Ribbon *World Class Chocolate *Cherries Jubilee *Chocolate Fudge *Daiquiri Ice *Rainbow Sherbet *Rainbow Chocolate Fudge Cake *Wild And Reckless *Strawberry Cheesecake *Pokey Dot *Mango Tango Seasonal Flavors *America's Birthday Cake *Baseball Nut *Blueberry Cheesecake *Bourbon Street Pecan Pie *Brownie Bar Mashup *Cherry Cordial with Kisses *Chocolate Mousse Royale *French Vanilla *Eggnog *German Chocolate Cake *Icing On The Cake *Love Potion #31 *New York Cheesecake *Nutty Coconut *Peppermint *Rock 'n' Pop Swirl *Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup *Trick Oreo Treat *Winter White Chocolate *Made With Snickers *Made With M&M;'s *Heath *Mango Tango *Pumpkin Cheesecake Regional Flavors *Pink Bubblegum *Caramel Macchiato *York Peppermint Pattie *Cotton Candy *Orange Sherbet *Grape Ice *Watermelon Ice *Miami Vice Sorbet *Splish Splash *Wild 'n' Reckless Sherbet *Lemon Custard *Oregon Blackberry *Bananas 'n' Strawberries *Mississippi Mud *Rum Raisin *Creole Cream Cheese *Chocolate Almond *Fudge Brownie *Banana Nut *Black Walnut *Cotton Candy Crackle *Quarterback Crunch *Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cheesecake *Caramel 'n' Cookies Bright Choices *Real Fruit Strawberry Sorbet *Premium Churned Light Raspberry Chip *Premium Churned Light Vanilla *Premium Churned Light Milk Chocolate *Premium Churned Dark Milk Chocolate *Premium Churned Reduced Fat, No Sugar Added Butter Almond Crunch *Premium Churned Reduced Fat, No Sugar Added Pineapple Coconut *Premium Churned Reduced Fat, No Sugar Added Brownie Sundae *Premium Churned Reduced Fat, No Sugar Added Caramel Turtle Truffle *Premium Churned Reduced Fat, No Sugar Added Moose Tracks *Premium Churned Reduced Fat, No Sugar Added Peanut Buttery Bar Blast *Fat Free Vanilla Frozen Yogurt == Hidden message of the logo == The pink part of the logo has the 31 inside meaning there are 31 flavours. == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:American food companies Category:1953 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in Massachusetts Category:Ice cream brands",
