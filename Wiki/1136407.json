The river flows westward, dividing the city into two parts: the Rive Gauche (left) and the Rive Droite (right) when facing downstream. The Rive Gauche is known for its association with famous artists, writers, and intellectuals, including Pablo Picasso, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein. It has long been a hub of bohemian culture, counterculture, and creativity, particularly in the *Montparnasse district. Some of the most famous streets on the Rive Gauche are Boulevard Saint- Germain, Boulevard Saint-Michel, and Rue de Vaugirard.
