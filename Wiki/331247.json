The airline flew planes between remote areas of the outback. They worked a lot with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The name was changed to Connair in 1970. Connair had money problems in the 1970s. The company was sold to another airline company on 14 March 1980. It was liquidated (turned into money and dismantled) shortly after. ==References== Category:Airlines of Australia Category:1943 establishments Category:1980 disestablishments Category:1940s establishments in Australia",
