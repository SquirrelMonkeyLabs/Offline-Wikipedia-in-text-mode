The words of Hughes' citation explain: > On 28 March 2003, D Squadron Household Cavalry Regiment were probing forward > along the Shatt Al Arab waterway, north of Basrah, some thirty kilometres > ahead of the main force of 16 Air Assault Brigade. In exposed desert, their > mission was to find and interdict the numerically vastly superior, and > better equipped, Iraqi 6th Armoured Division. Trooper Finney, a young > armoured vehicle driver with less than a year's service, was driving the > leading Scimitar vehicle of his troop, which had been at the forefront of > action against enemy armour for several hours. In the early afternoon, the > two leading vehicles paused beside a levee to allow the troop leader to > assess fully the situation in front. Without warning, they were engaged by a > pair of Coalition Forces ground attack aircraft. Both vehicles were hit and > caught fire, and ammunition began exploding inside the turrets. Trooper > Finney managed to get out of his driving position and was on the way towards > cover when he noticed that his vehicle's gunner was trapped in the turret. > He then climbed onto the fiercely burning vehicle, at the same time placing > himself at risk from enemy fire, as well as fire from the aircraft should > they return. Despite the smoke and flames and exploding ammunition, he > managed to haul out the injured gunner, get him off the vehicle, and move > him to a safer position not far away, where he bandaged his wounds. The > troop officer, in the other Scimitar, had been wounded and there were no > senior ranks to take control.

He > therefore broke cover, returned to his vehicle which was still burning, and > calmly and concisely sent a lucid situation report by radio. He then > returned to the injured gunner and began helping him towards a Spartan > vehicle of the Royal Engineers which had moved forward to assist. At this > point, Trooper Finney noticed that both the aircraft were lining up for a > second attack. Notwithstanding the impending danger, he continued to help > his injured comrade towards the safety of the Spartan vehicle. Both aircraft > fired their cannon and Trooper Finney was wounded in the buttocks and legs, > and the gunner in the head. Despite his wounds, Trooper Finney succeeded in > getting the gunner to the waiting Spartan. Then, seeing that the driver of > the second Scimitar was still in the burning vehicle, Trooper Finney > determined to rescue him as well. Despite his wounds and the continuing > danger from exploding ammunition, he valiantly attempted to climb up onto > the vehicle, but was beaten back by the combination of heat, smoke and > exploding ammunition. He collapsed exhausted a short distance from the > vehicle, and was recovered by the crew of the Royal Engineers' Spartan. > During these attacks and their horrifying aftermath, Trooper Finney > displayed clear-headed courage and devotion to his comrades which was out of > all proportion to his age and experience.
