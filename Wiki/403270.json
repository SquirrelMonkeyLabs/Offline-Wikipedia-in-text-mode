The movie tells the story of an orphan adopted by a rich man. Temple introduced one of her signature songs, \"Animal Crackers in My Soup\", in the movie. Curly Top was a box office hit, but it was banned in Denmark for unspecified \"corruption\". In China, Madame Chiang Kai-shek asked for repeated private showings.Temple, Shirley. 1989.
