In 2020, 1,129 people lived there. ==History== A group of British people led by a Scotsman named George Grant created Victoria in 1873. They created it on land he had bought from the Kansas Pacific Railway. They named the settlement after Queen Victoria. Grant wanted Victoria to be a ranching community. He was apparently responsible for bringing the first Aberdeen Angus cattle to the United States. Most of the colonists, however, were remittance men more interested in sports and dancing than in raising animals. Their families soon learned of this and lowered the remittances. This caused most of the colonists to leave by 1880. Some returned to Britain; others left for South America. In 1876, Volga Germans from villages near Saratov, Russia created the settlement of Herzog one half mile north of Victoria. Herzog's Roman Catholic settlers built a many churches. Herzog grew quickly and later took over Victoria, eventually taking the older settlement's name. Herzog was officially renamed Victoria in 1913. In 1942, the U.S. Army built Walker Army Airfield 3 miles northeast of Victoria. During World War II, thousands were put there at the airfield. The military closed the base in 1946.
