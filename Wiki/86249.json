It can only hurt people standing very close to the character. * Pistol: this gun is small and weak. It is the gun the player starts with. * Machine Gun: this is like the pistol except it shoots faster. * Chaingun: this gun shoots very quickly. ==Controversy== Because of the use of Nazi symbols and music in the game, Wolfenstein 3D was banned in Germany.
