 "text": "Philautus nephophilus is a frog. It lives in Malaysia. People have seen it in Kinabalu National Park, between 1400 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and near the edges of forests. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it does not live in a very large place, part of that place is a protected park. The adult male frog is 16.4–18.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 20.3–23.1 mm long. This frog can change color. During the day, this frog is darker in color than it is at night, and its belly is yellow with dark brown spots. At night, this frog's head and shoulders are deeper brown than the rest of the body. The sides of the back legs are gray in color with whitish spots or other marks. The skin around the eardrum is yellow in color. The iris of the eye is red in color, and the pupils of the eye open up and down. This frog has teeth in its upper jaw. Its tongue is long and wide. All four legs are thin. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
