 "text": "thumb|right|Diana of Versailles is a statue of Diana that is now in the Louvre in Paris. This statue dates from the first or second century. It may have been modelled on an older statue of the Greek period. Diana was the goddess of hunting (and in later times, the moon and chastity) in Roman mythology. Cypress trees were sacred to her. She was the daughter of Jupiter and the Titan Latona (or Leto). In Greek mythology, Diana was called Artemis. She is also associated with fertility and nature. Artemis is her Greek equivalent. According to mythology Diana was born with her twin brother Apollo on the island of Delos. Apollo was her only real brother but she had many half brothers and sisters from her father. Her half-siblings were Vulcan, Minerva, Mercury, Bacchus, Mars, and Proserpine. Diana made a group of three with two other Roman deities: Egeria the water nymph, her servant and midwife helper; and Virbius, the god of the woods. Diana is a maiden goddess which means she can not marry. == Other websites == * Landscape with Diana and Callisto painting * Diana and her Nymphs painting Category:Roman gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of the moon Category:Virgin goddesses",
