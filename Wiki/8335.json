 "text": "A mathematical equation is an expression containing two mathematical objects connected by an equals sign (=) .\"A statement of equality between two expressions. Equations are of two types, identities and conditional equations (or usually simply \"equations\")\". « Equation », in Mathematics Dictionary, Glenn James et Robert C. James (éd.), Van Nostrand, 1968, 3 ed. 1st ed. 1948, p. 131.Une équation est une égalité entre deux expressions mathématiques, donc une formule de la forme A = B, où les deux membres A et B de l'équation sont des expressions où figurent une ou plusieurs variables, représentées par des lettres. ÉQUATION, mathématique - Encyclopædia Universalis The equals sign says that both sides are exactly equal, or of the same value. An equation can be as simple as x=0, or as complex as 4(3y^{99})+76=42+3x or harder. There are two kinds of mathematical equations: * The kind of equation that is either true or false; these are also called identities. For example: :2\\cdot(x+4)=2x+8\\rightarrow\\text{true} * The kind of equation that is only true for certain values of the variable(s). The equation is only true if the variable(s) have that value. For example: : 2\\cdot x=8\\rightarrow x=4 The second kind is often used to solve problems in which finding the value of some variables is involved. For example, if : 2x=8, x=\\frac82=4 The second kind of equation is used in algebra. For example, to solve the equation 2x=8 for x, one would follow an algebraic rule to find that x=4. == Types of equations == Equations can be classified by the types of operations and quantities involved. For example: * An algebraic equation is an equation in which both sides are polynomials. These are further classified by degree: ** Linear equation for degree one ** Quadratic equation for degree two ** Cubic equation for degree three ** Quartic equation for degree four ** Quintic equation for degree five * A Diophantine equation is an equation where the unknowns are required to be integers * A differential equation is a functional equation involving derivatives of the unknown functions, which include: ** Ordinary differential equation ** Partial differential equation == Related pages == * Equation solving * Formula * Rate equation * System of linear equations ==References== Category:Equations",
