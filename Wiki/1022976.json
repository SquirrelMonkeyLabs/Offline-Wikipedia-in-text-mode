 "text": "Senapti's bubble-nest frog or Senapti's tree frog (Rohanixalus senapatiensis) is a frog. It lives in northeastern India. ==Habitat== This frog lives in forests. People see it near the outsides of forests, less in the middles of forests. They also see it on farms, near places where people live, and in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. It does not need the tree branches to come together like a roof but it does need many smaller plants. People have seen this frog between 200 and 1600 meters above sea level. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Ngengpui Wildlife Sanctuary. ==Young== Scientists think this frog lays eggs in early May. This is when India's monsoon rainstorms happen. The male frogs call to the female frogs after the sun goes down, at night. They do not call during the day. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. It is in some danger because people change the places where it lives to make towns and roads and farms and because bad chemicals in the water from chemicals meant to kill pests and chemicals meant to kill plants. Cars and other things with wheels might also hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
