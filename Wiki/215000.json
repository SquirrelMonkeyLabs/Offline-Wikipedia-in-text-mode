 "text": "The Slovak men's national ice hockey team is one of the best national ice hockey teams in the world. As of 2008, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the world governing body of ice hockey, ranks them as the eighth best national team. The team is operated by the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation under general manager Peter Bondra, and head coach Ján Filc. In the last six years, Slovakia has won three medals at the World Championships, including a gold medal in 2002. Slovakia has a total of 12,375 hockey players (0.23% of the population). ==History== The Slovak national team was created after Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. For years, the Czechs kept control over how the Czechoslovakian national team was run, and limited how many Slovak players were on the team. When the country became two, the Czech Republic team was allowed to compete at the highest pool (A), and the IIHF ruled that because fewer players of the former Czechoslovak team were Slovaks, Slovakia have to start international play in pool C, the lowest group. However, Slovakia's play in the lower pools won it promotion to pool A by 1996. ==Olympic record== * 1994 - Finished in 6th place * 1998 - Finished in 10th place * 2002 - Finished in 13th place * 2006 - Finished in 5th place (see roster) * 2010 - Finished in 4th place ==World Cup record== *1996 - Did not qualify *2004 - Lost in quarter-finals ==World Championship record== *1994 - Finished in 21st place (winner of the \"Pool C\") *1995 - Finished in 13th place (winner of the \"Pool B\") *1996 - Finished in 10th place *1997 - Finished in 9th place *1998 - Finished in 7th place *1999 - Finished in 7th place *2000 - Won silver medal *2001 - Finished in 7th place *2002 - Won gold medal *2003 - Won bronze medal *2004 - Finished in 4th place *2005 - Finished in 5th place *2006 - Finished in 8th place *2007 - Finished in 6th place *2008 - Finished in 13th place *2009 - Finished in 10th place ==World Championship 2009 Roster== Goaltenders Goaltenders Goaltenders Goaltenders Goaltenders Goaltenders # Player Date of Birth Club 25 Ján Lašák April 10, 1979 Moeller Pardubice 31 Rastislav Staňa January 10, 1980 Severstal Cherepovets 41 Jaroslav Halák May 13, 1985 Montreal Canadiens Defensemen Defensemen Defensemen Defensemen Defensemen Defensemen # Player Date of Birth Club 6 Peter Smrek February 16, 1979 Lasselsberger Plzeň 7 Ivan Baranka May 19, 1985 Spartak Moscow 12 Ivan Švarný October 31, 1984 Litvínov 15 Dominik Graňák June 11, 1983 Färjestad 29 René Vydarený May 6, 1981 České Budějovice 43 Jaroslav Obšut September 3, 1976 Luleå 44 Andrej Sekera June 8, 1986 Buffalo Sabres 48 Boris Valábik February 14, 1986 Atlanta Thrashers Forwards Forwards Forwards Forwards Forwards Forwards # Player Date of Birth Club 4 Jiří Bicek December 3, 1978 EHC Biel 10 Milan Bartovič April 9, 1981 Bílí Tygři Liberec 14 Štefan Ružička February 17, 1985 Spartak Moscow 17 Michal Macho January 17, 1982 MHC Martin 19 Rastislav Pavlikovský March 2, 1977 Sibir Novosibirsk 20 Juraj Štefanka January 28, 1976 Vítkovice 23 Ľuboš Bartečko (C) July 14, 1976 Luleå 26 Michal Handzuš (A) March 11, 1977 Los Angeles Kings 27 Ladislav Nagy (A) June 1, 1979 Severstal Cherepovets 28 Peter Ölvecký May 20, 1985 Minnesota Wild 34 Tomáš Surový September 24, 1981 Linköping 71 Juraj Mikúš February 22, 1987 36 Skalica 81 Marcel Hossa October 21, 1981 Dinamo Riga 92 Branko Radivojevič November 24, 1980 Spartak Moscow ==2002 Gold Medallists== Goalies: Ján Lašák, Rastislav Staňa, Miroslav Šimonovič.
