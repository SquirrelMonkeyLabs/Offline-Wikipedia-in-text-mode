The game features three sections in its main menu: My House, where the player designs minigames, WarioWare, the tutorial, and My Shop, where the player makes microgame cassettes. When creating the music, the player can sing through the DS's microphone, which the DS then turns them into notes. These notes can then be performed by various instruments such as pig noises. Players can send their creations to other D.I.Y. owners or receive other people's works. They can also be uploaded to Nintendo Wi-Fi connection for contest purposes. Microgames made available by Nintendo can be downloaded, too. Additionally, the WiiWare game Asobu Made in Ore allows users to play the microgames on the Wii with the Wii remote's pointer. ==Story== ===Diamond Software=== * Mona * Jimmy T. * Ashley & Red * Orbulon * 9-Volt ===Wario-Man Software=== * Wario-Man * Dribble & Spitz * Kat & Ana * 18-Volt == References == Category:2009 video games Category:2010 video games Category:WarioWare Category:Action video games Category:Intelligent Systems games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
