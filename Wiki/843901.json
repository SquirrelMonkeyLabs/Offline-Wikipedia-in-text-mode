 "text": "Skirt steak is a type of meat cut from the plate. It is long, flat and flavorful. ==Overview== This steak has an outside part and an inside part. Both the inside and outside skirt steak are trimmed and have no bones. This steak is covered in a tough membrane that should be removed before cooking. The inside skirt steak is often confused with the flank steak, which is the tail of the porter house and T-bone steaks of the short loin found on the flank. It has similar ways of cooking. In the United States, the North American Meat Processors Association (NAMP) indentifies all skirts steaks NAMP 121. NAMP 121 is further subdivided into the outer (outside) skirt steak (NAMP 121C) and the inner (inside) skirt steak (NAMP 121D). The beef flank steak (NAMP 193) is next to the skirt, nearer the animal's rear quarter. ==Preparation== Like most steaks, the skirt steak can be cooked with different methods. Skirt steak can be used for making fajitas, arrachera, Chinese stir- fry, churrasco, and in Cornish pasties. To make it less tough and more flavorful, skirt steaks are often marinated before grilling, pan-seared very quickly or cooked very slowly, typically braised. They are usually sliced against the grain before serving to make it more tender. ==References== Category:Cuts of beef",
