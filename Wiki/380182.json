 "text": "A ski resort is a place where people go skiing or to do other winter sports. Usually, these places are towns or villages in the mountains. This is because a lot of snow is needed for these sports. Ski lifts and slopes down the mountain are also needed. The lifts are usually cable cars, gondola lifts and chairlifts. Ski resorts also have hotels and restaurants for tourists. There are many ski resorts around the world. The Alps in Europe have a lot, and so do the United States and Canada. There are very few in Africa because it does not snow a lot there. ==Other websites== *",
