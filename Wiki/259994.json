He began his NHL career with the Montreal Canadiens in 1995–96 after three seasons with TPS of the Finnish SM- liiga. Koivu served as the Canadiens' captain for nine of his thirteen seasons with the club (not including the locked-out 2004–05 season), which makes his the second longest captaincy tenure in team history after Jean Béliveau. Koivu was the first European to captain the Montreal Canadiens. On September 6, 2001, Koivu was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma, a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and he nearly all of the 2001–02 season. After he had been suffering serious pains in his stomach and was vomiting went to see the Canadiens' physician David Mulder, who, after many tests discovered the cancer. He was expected to miss the season but he made a comeback in time for the last few games. The fans gave Koivu an eight-minute standing ovation when he skated onto the Molson Centre ice for the first time on April 9, 2002. For both his courage and his off-ice team leadership while he was undergoing cancer treatment, Koivu was awarded the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy following the 2002 playoffs. ==Awards and honors== ===SM-liiga=== * Kultainen kypärä award (Players choice for the best player) - 1995 * Jari Kurri trophy (Best player in playoffs) - 1995 * Lasse Oksanen trophy (Most valuable player) - 1995 * Veli-Pekka Ketola trophy (Most points in regular season) - 1995 * President's Trophy - 1999 ===NHL=== * Voted to the NHL All-Star Game by the fans - 1998, 2003 (did not play due to injury) * Bill Masterton Trophy - 2002 * King Clancy Memorial Trophy - 2007 * First ever European-born captain of the Montreal Canadiens - 1999-2009 ===International=== * Ice Hockey World Championships Tournament All-Star - 1994, 1995, 1999 * Ice Hockey World Championships Tournament's Best Forward - 1995, 1999 * Ice Hockey World Championships Tournament's Top scorer - 1999 * Finnish Ice hockey player of the year - 1994, 1995 * Turin 2006 Winter Olympics - Tournament All-Star * Turin 2006 Winter Olympics - Top scorer * Captain of Team Finland - 1998-2010 ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM +/– GP G A Pts PIM 1992–93 TPS SM-L 46 3 7 10 28 -5 11 3 2 5 2 1993–94 TPS SM-L 47 23 30 53 42 +27 11 4 8 12 16 1994–95 TPS SM-L 45 27 47 74 73 +33 13 7 10 17 16 1995–96 Montreal Canadiens NHL 82 20 25 45 40 -7 6 3 1 4 8 1996–97 Montreal Canadiens NHL 50 17 39 56 38 +7 5 1 3 4 10 1997–98 Montreal Canadiens NHL 69 14 43 57 48 +8 6 2 3 5 2 1998–99 Montreal Canadiens NHL 65 14 30 44 38 -7 — — — — — 1999–00 Montreal Canadiens NHL 24 3 18 21 14 +7 — — — — — 2000–01 Montreal Canadiens NHL 54 17 30 47 40 +2 — — — — — 2001–02 Montreal Canadiens NHL 3 0 2 2 0 0 12 4 6 10 4 2002–03 Montreal Canadiens NHL 82 21 50 71 72 +5 — — — — — 2003–04 Montreal Canadiens NHL 68 14 41 55 52 -5 11 3 8 11 10 2004–05 TPS SM-l 20 8 8 16 28 +11 6 3 2 5 30 2005–06 Montreal Canadiens NHL 72 17 45 62 70 +1 3 0 2 2 2 2006–07 Montreal Canadiens NHL 81 22 53 75 74 -21 — — — — — 2007–08 Montreal Canadiens NHL 77 16 40 56 93 -4 7 3 6 9 4 2008–09 Montreal Canadiens NHL 65 16 34 50 44 +4 4 0 3 3 2 2009–10 Anaheim Ducks NHL 71 19 33 52 36 +14 — — — — — 2010–11 Anaheim Ducks NHL 75 15 30 45 36 -8 6 1 6 7 6 2011–12 Anaheim Ducks NHL 74 11 27 38 50 +7 — — — — — 2012–13 Anaheim Ducks NHL 47 8 19 27 18 +4 7 1 2 3 6 2013–14 Anaheim Ducks NHL 65 11 18 29 46 +3 13 0 1 1 8 NHL totals NHL totals NHL totals 1124 255 577 832 809 +10 80 18 41 59 62 SM-L totals SM-L totals SM-L totals 158 61 92 153 171 +66 41 17 22 39 64 ===International=== Year Team Event Result GP G A Pts PIM 1993 Finland WC 6 0 1 1 2 1994 Finland OLY 8 4 3 7 12 1994 Finland WC 8 5 6 11 4 1995 Finland WC 8 5 5 10 18 1996 Finland WCH 4 1 3 4 4 1997 Finland WC 6 2 2 4 2 1998 Finland OLY 6 2 8 10 4 1999 Finland WC 10 4 12 16 4 2003 Finland WC 7 1 10 11 4 2004 Finland WCH 6 3 1 4 2 2006 Finland OLY 8 3 8 11 12 2008 Finland WC 6 0 3 3 4 2010 Finland OLY 6 0 2 2 6 WC totals WC totals WC totals WC totals 51 17 39 56 38 OLY totals OLY totals OLY totals OLY totals 28 9 21 30 34 WCH totals WCH totals WCH totals WCH totals 10 4 4 8 6 Int'l totals Int'l totals Int'l totals Int'l totals 89 30 64 94 78 ==References== ==Other websites== * *Saku Koivu on nhlfinns.com * Category:1974 births Category:Anaheim Ducks players Category:Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winners Category:Finnish ice hockey centres Category:Living people Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Olympic silver medalists for Finland Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Finland Category:Ice hockey people from Turku",
