 "text": "Alberto Olmedo (Barrio Pichincha, Rosario, Santa Fe Province, August 24, 1933 â€“ March 5, 1988) was an Argentine comedian and actor. Popularly regarded as one of the most important comedian in the history of the show of his country, for his outstanding work in television, cinema and theater. ==Early life== Olmedo was born in the city of Rosario. In his teens, he was a gymnast and an aspiring actor. He tried his luck with several amateur theater companies and enjoyed some local success. ==Career== Olmedo moved to Buenos Aires in 1954. One year later, while working as a technician in Canal 7, Argentina's first television station, his improvisation skills caught the attention of the management, who gave him acting jobs in several TV shows. Even though Olmedo had a string of successful children's programs during the 1960s, the peak of his abilities would arrive when given the opportunity to mix slapstick, nonsense, and adult-oriented entertainment. ==Personal life== Olmedo married and divorced twice, and had six children (including Alberto Jr.). ==Death== Olmedo died in the vacation town of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province, on March 5, 1988. According to police reports, he slipped off his eleventh-floor apartment's balcony. It is believed that he tried, possibly under the influence of alcohol or cocaine, to perform a high-wire stunt on the balcony and lost his balance. He is buried in La Chacarita Cemetery, Buenos Aires. ==Other websites== * \"Official\" home page (in Spanish) * Olmedo Bio (in Spanish) * * An exposition of Olmedo-related art Category:1933 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Argentine actors Category:Argentine comedians Category:People from Rosario, Argentina",
