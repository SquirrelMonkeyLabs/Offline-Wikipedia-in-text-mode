 "text": "Language planning is the attempt to influence how a language is used. This is usually done to make it possible to use the language for more subjects. Goals, objectives and strategies are made to change the way a language is used. For many languages there are special organisations, that look after the language. Examples of such organisations are the Academie Fran√ßaise for French or the British Council for English. In general, there are different forms of language planning: *Corpus planning creates new words, expressions or changes old ones to have a new meaning. Corpus planning is involved with creating standards for a language, such as spelling and grammar, or to create dictionaries. Linguistic purity is about avoiding foreign influences to a language because they are seen as bad. It also belongs to corpus planning. *Status planning wants to change the way a language is used. It is about making some languages (or dialects) official languages for a territory. Very often, part of status planning is creating a writing system for a language that was only spoken before. *Acquisition planning is about teaching the language. It looks at ways to make it easier or more attractive to learn a language. Very often, acquisition planning also involves making the language more attractive to learn for speakers of other languages.
