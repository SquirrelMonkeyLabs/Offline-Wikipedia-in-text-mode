 "text": "An enterotype is a classification of gut flora. It is based on the ecosystem in the human intestinal system. The classification is done by identifying the bacteria and protists which live there. This is called the \"human gut biome\". Research shows there are three distinct ecosystems in the guts of people. People can be classified into one of three groups based on the bacteria in their intestines. The enterotype of each person is set while the person is an infant.Dyer, Betsy Dexter 2003. A field guide to bacteria. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, Chapter 12: Gram-positive bacteria as symbionts of animals and plants. ISBN 0-8014-8854-0 The enterotype affects how well a person can digest food or absorb drugs. Chimpanzees have enterotypes that look similar to human enterotypes. Type 1 has high levels of Bacteroides. Prevotella are common in Type 2. Type 3 has high levels of Ruminococcus. == References == Category:Microbiology",
