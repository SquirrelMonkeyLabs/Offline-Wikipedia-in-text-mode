 "text": "The A74(M) and M74 are two connected motorways in Scotland. They act as one motorway, usually just called the \"M74\". The motorway starts at the border with England. Here, the M6 motorway turns into the A74(M) motorway. The motorway connects the M6 with Glasgow and the M8. About halfway between the border with England and Glasgow, the A74(M) becomes the M74. Together, the motorways are long. ==Junctions== M74 motorway Northbound exits Junction Southbound exits Glasgow Airport M8 Kilmarnock M77 Start of motorway Tradeston Kinning Park J1 Tradeston Kinning Park Polmadie B763 Rutherglen (A730) J1A Polmadie B763 Rutherglen (A730) Rutherglen, Cambuslang A724 J2 Rutherglen, Cambuslang A724 Tollcross, Rutherglen A74 J2A Tollcross Cambuslang A74 Shettleston, Cambuslang A763 J3 No access No access J3A Tannochside, Uddingston A721 Stirling, Kincardine Bridge M73 Uddingston, Mount Vernon A721 J4 Stirling, Kincardine Bridge, Edinburgh M73 No access Services Bothwell services Southbound only Bellshill, Coatbridge, East Kilbride A725 Edinburgh (A8) J5 Bellshill, Coatbridge, East Kilbride A725 Edinburgh (A8) Hamilton services Northbound only Services No access Hamilton, Motherwell, Wishaw A723 J6 Motherwell, Wishaw, Hamilton A723 No access J7 Lanark, Larkhall A72 Kilmarnock, Edinburgh A71 Larkhall B7078 J8 Kilmarnock, Edinburgh A71 No access J9 Kirkmuirhill, Blackwood, Lesmahagow, Coalburn B7078 Lesmahagow, Kirkmuirhill, Blackwood B7078 J10 No access No access J11/Services Edinburgh, Ayr B7078 (A70) Happendon (Cairn Lodge) Services Edinburgh, Ayr A70 Happendon (Cairn Lodge) Services J12/Services No access Road continues as M74 J13/Services Edinburgh A702 Lanark (A73) Abington services A74(M) motorway Northbound exits Junction Southbound exits Edinburgh A702 Lanark (A73) Abington services J13 Road continues as A74(M) Crawford A702 Thornhill (A76), Crawfordjohn J14 Crawford A702 Thornhill (A76), Crawfordjohn Moffat, Dumfries A701, Selkirk (A708) J15 Dumfries, Moffat A701, Selkirk (A708) Johnstonebridge B7076 Annandale Water Services J16/Services Johnstonebridge B7076 Annandale Water Services Lockerbie B7068 J17 Lockerbie B7068 Dumfries (A709) Lockerbie B723 Dumfries (A709) J18 No access Ecclefechan B7076 J19 Ecclefechan B7076 Eaglesfield, Annan B722 J20 Eaglesfield, Annan, Kirtlebridge B722 Kirtlebridge, Kirkpatrick Fleming B7076 Canonbie B6357 J21 Canonbie B6357 Kirtlebridge, Kirkpatrick Fleming B7076 Gretna Green Services Services Gretna Green Services Dumfries, Stranraer, Gretna A75 J22 Longtown (A6071) Gretna, Gretna Green B7076 Entry into Scotland Border Entry into England Start of A74(M) motorway M6 J45 continues as the M6 to Carlisle, Penrith and The South ==References== Category:Motorways in Scotland",
