 "text": "The Maranao people (Maranao: Bangsa Mëranaw; Filipino: mga Maranaw ), also spelled Meranaw, Maranaw, and Mëranaw, is a predominantly Muslim Filipino ethnic group native to the region around Lanao Lake in the island of Mindanao. They are known for their artwork, weaving, wood, plastic and metal crafts and epic literature, the Darangen. They are ethnically and culturally closely related to the Iranun people and Maguindanao people, all three groups being denoted speaking Danao languages and giving name to the island of Mindanao. They are grouped with other Moro people due to their shared religion. == Etymology == The name \"Maranao\" (also spelled \"Mëranaw\", or \"Maranaw\") means \"people of the lake\" (lanaw or ranaw, archaic danaw, means \"lake\" in the Maranao language). This is in reference to Lake Lanao, the predominant geographic feature of the ancestral homeland of the Maranao people. ===Music and performing arts=== Maranao kulintang music is a type of a gong music. Sarunaay is also found among both Muslim and non-Muslim groups of the Southern Philippines. Kobbing is a Maranao instrument and Biyula is another popular instrument. Biyula is a string instrument. In 2005, the Darangen Epic of the Maranao people of Lake Lanao was selected by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. ==References== Category:Indigenous peoples of the Philippines Category:Ethnic groups in the Philippines Category:Maranao",
