 "text": "Interstate 165 (I-165) is a spur from I-65 that provides access to Mobile, Alabama. It travels for approximately from Water Street in downtown Mobile north to I-65 in Prichard. The route is elevated for its entire length. I-165 began life as a planned Interstate 210 (I-210). Many problems, including community opposition and access to the Mobile waterfront, prevented the freeway from reaching its intended southern end at I-10; I-165 ends about short of I-10 and becomes Water Street. Since the road had no connection to I-10, the number 210 was no longer appropriate to the freeway, so 165 was chosen instead. ==References== 165",
