Al-Kasasbeh was a First Lieutenant in the Royal Jordanian Air Force. The plane he was piloting, an F-16 fighter jet, crashed after mechanical problems on December 24, 2014, though Islamic State claimed it shot his aircraft down. He was captured by Islamic State militants near Raqqa, Syria. He was threatened with execution, but there were negotiations to release him. However, Islamic State decapitated his co-prisoner, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, and subsequently burned Al-Kasasbeh to death while he was locked in a cage. ==References== Category:1988 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Jordanian people Category:Kidnapped people Category:People murdered in Syria",
