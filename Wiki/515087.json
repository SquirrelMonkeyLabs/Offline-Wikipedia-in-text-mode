 "text": "Adam Richard Deadmarsh (born May 10, 1975) is a Canadian-American retired professional ice hockey right winger. Deadmarsh played parts of 10 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Quebec Nordiques, Colorado Avalanche, and Los Angeles Kings. Deadmarsh played for Team USA during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, the 1998 Winter Olympics, and the 2002 Winter Olympics. He won a gold medal in 1996 and a silver medal in 2002. ==Career== Before playing in the NHL, Deadmarsh played 4 seasons with the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He was drafted with the 14th overall pick by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. He played 1 season with them and stayed with the franchise when they relocated to Denver, Colorado to become the Colorado Avalanche. During his time with the Avalanche, Deadmarsh won the Stanley Cup in 1996. His name was misspelled as \"Deadmarch\" when the names were being added to the Cup. It was the first time that a misspelling on the Stanley Cup had ever been corrected. On February 21, 2001, the Avalanche traded Deadmarsh along with Aaron Miller in exchange for Jared Aulin, and Colorado's first round pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft (Dave Steckel) for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht. During round one of the 2001 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Deadmarsh scored an overtime goal which caused the Kings defeat the very favoured Detroit Red Wings. The Kings would lose against his old team, the Avalanche, in seven games. The Avalanche would end up winning their second Stanley Cup. Deadmarsh would miss most of the 2002–03 NHL season because of a concussion and missed the whole 2003–04 NHL seasonbecause of another concussion. He also did not play the next season because of the 2004–05 NHL lockout. On September 22, 2005, he announced that he was retiring from playing professional ice hockey. On March 20, 2006, Deadmarsh was honoured before a game between the Avalanche and Kings at Staples Center. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1975 births Category:American ice hockey right wingers Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States Category:Canadian ice hockey right wingers Category:Colorado Avalanche players Category:Ice hockey people from British Columbia Category:Living people Category:Los Angeles Kings players Category:People from Trail, British Columbia Category:Portland Winterhawks players Category:Quebec Nordiques players Category:Stanley Cup champions",
