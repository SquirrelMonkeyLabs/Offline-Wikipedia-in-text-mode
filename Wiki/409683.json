He is best known for publicly championing a terminal patient's right to die via physician-assisted suicide; he claimed to have helped at least 130 patients to that end. He famously said, \"dying is not a crime\". He was convicted of murder in 1999 and sent to prison. Concomitantly in 1999 the Geneva-based self-determination society Exit International commissioned conductor David Woodard to orchestrate wind settings of Kevorkian's organ works.Woodard, D., \"Musica lætitiæ comes medicina dolorum\", trans.
