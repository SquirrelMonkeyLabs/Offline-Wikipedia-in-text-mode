 "text": "Allobates undulatus is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and it lives on the ground. It lives in forests that grow next to rivers. Scientists saw this frog in exactly one place: Cerro Yutaj√©. Scientists saw the frog 1750 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in one protected park: Monumento Natural Los Tepuyes. ==Young== Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams, like tadpoles from other frogs in Allobates. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Climate change can hurt this frog because it only lives in one small place. If that place gets hotter or colder or if the amount of weather changes, the frogs could all die. Like other animals that only live in one small place, A. undulatus could also be killed by a sickness. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
