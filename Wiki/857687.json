 "text": "The 2021 Virginia gubernatorial election happened on November 2, 2021, to elect the next governor of Virginia. Incumbent Governor Ralph Northam is unable to run, as the Constitution of Virginia does not allow terms to be served in a row. The Democratic Party chose previous Governor Terry McAuliffe, and the Republican Party chose Glenn Youngkin. Teacher Princess Blanding ran under the new Liberation Party. In the general election on November 2, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the election over Democrat and former Governor Terry McAuliffe, making him the first Republican to win a statewide election in Virginia since 2009. ==Democratic primary election== ===Candidates=== ====Chosen==== *Terry McAuliffe, previous governor of Virginia (2014-2018). ====Lost in primary election==== *Jennifer Carroll Foy, previous state delegate for the 2nd house district (2018-2020). *Lee J.
