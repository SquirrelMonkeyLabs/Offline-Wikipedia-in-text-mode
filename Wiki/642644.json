 "text": "The 2019 UEFA Champions League Final was the last match of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League. The campaign was the 64th season of Europe's top club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 27th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid, Spain on 1 June 2019. The match was played between English sides Tottenham Hotspur, in their first European Cup final, and Liverpool, in their ninth final overall and their second in a row, having been lost to Real Madrid in 2018. Liverpool won the final 2–0, with a penalty after 106 seconds from Mohamed Salah and a strike by substitute Divock Origi in the 87th minute. It was Liverpool's sixth European Cup win and the club's first time since 2005. As winners, Liverpool will play against Chelsea, the winners of the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup. They will also qualify to enter the group stage of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, and if they have already qualified through their league performance, the spot reserved will be given to the champions of the 2018–19 Austrian Bundesliga, the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list. In March 2018, UEFA announced that a fourth substitution will be allowed in extra time and that the number of substitutes has been increased from 7 to 12. The kick-off time was also changed from 20:45 CEST to 21:00 CEST. ==Teams== In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup times, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League times.
