 "text": "In organic chemistry, an imine is a chemical compound that has a carbon atom with a double bond to a nitrogen atom. The functional group is called imino. == Types == Imines are divided into primary and secondary imines based on what else is connected to the nitrogen atom. If nitrogen is connected to hydrogen, it is a primary imine. If it is connected to carbon, it is a secondary imine. Imines are also divided into groups depending on what the carbon is connected to. If it is connected to two other carbons, it is a ketimine (like a ketone). If it is connected to hydrogen, it is an aldimine (like an aldehyde). == Production == Imines are made by a condensation reaction between carbonyl compounds and ammonia or primary amines. Different types of ingredient give different types of imine: ketones give ketimines, aldehydes give aldimines, ammonia gives primary imines, and primary amines give secondary imines. This reaction makes water as a byproduct. This condensation is reversible: an imine and a water molecule can react, breaking the imine apart into the original ingredients. (Breaking a molecule up with water is called hydrolysis.) Something needs to remove the water in order to keep the reaction going. This can be a process like distillation, or an added desiccant. == References == Category:Imino compounds Category:Functional groups",
