 "text": "The 2016 Conservative Party leadership election happened after the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron following the national referendum to leave the European Union. Cameron, who supported Britain's continued membership of the EU, announced his resignation on 24 June, saying that he would step down by October. Theresa May won the contest on 11 July 2016, after the withdrawal of Andrea Leadsom left her as the sole candidate. Five Conservative MPs were candidates: Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb, former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change Andrea Leadsom, and Home Secretary Theresa May. The Previous Mayor of London Boris Johnson, chose not to run even though some people thought he could win. In the first-round vote, May, got the support of half of Conservative MPs. Leadsom got the second most amount of votes. Leadsom left the contest on 11 July. May was made party leader later that day, and Prime Minister on 13 July. She put Boris Johnson, Fox and Leadsom to her cabinet. If Leadsom didn't leave, Conservative Party members would have directly elected a new Prime Minister for the first time. == References == Conservative Party leadership election Category:Conservative Party (UK)",
