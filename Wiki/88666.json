 "text": "Tokio Hotel is a German pop-rock band. The band began in 2001, and were first called Devilish. The people who are in the band all came from Magdeburg in Germany. The youngest, the Kaulitz twins, were born two months before the Berlin Wall was taken down. Gustav Schäfer is married to Linda Schäfer, they met in 2009. Tom Kaulitz married Heidi Klum in 2019. George Listing is now engaged. == History == Tokio Hotel was started by singer Bill Kaulitz and guitarist Tom Kaulitz, who are identical twin brothers. Their step father owns a music school named \"Rock School\". The drummer is Gustav Schäfer and bass-guitarist is Georg Listing. The four met in 2001 after a live show in a Magdeburg club, where Listing and Schäfer, who knew each other from music school, watched from the audience while Bill and Tom Kaulitz played on the stage. Using the name \"Devilish\", the band began playing in talent shows and small concerts. After Bill Kaulitz took part in a children's Star Search in 2003 at age thirteen (which he lost in the quarter-final), he was discovered by music producer Peter Hoffmann. Devilish changed their name to \"Tokio Hotel\": \"Tokio\", the German spelling of the Japanese city Tokyo, because they love the city, and \"Hotel\" because of their constant touring and living in hotels. Soon after Sony BMG took them under contract, Hoffmann hired David Jost and Pat Benzner into the team. They guided the teens on songwriting and instrument playing. Most of the songs of the first album were written by Hoffmann, Jost, Benzer, and Bill Kaulitz (including the singles \"Scream\" and \"Rescue me\" which were completely written by them). Only the single \"Unendlichkeit\" was written completely by Tokio Hotel themselves. However, shortly before release of their first album, Sony ended their contract. In 2005, Universal Music Group took Tokio Hotel under contract and developed a marketing plan. The band has now become one of the biggest acts from Germany. ==Band members== * Bill Kaulitz – lead vocals * Tom Kaulitz – guitars, keyboards, piano, percussion, backing vocals * Georg Listing – bass, keyboards, backing vocals * Gustav Schäfer – drums, percussion, backing vocals ==Discography== Studio albums * Schrei (2005) * Zimmer 483 (2007) * Scream (2007) * Humanoid (2009) * Kings of Suburbia (2014) * Dream Machine (2017) * 2001 (2022) ==Videography== Music videos * List of Tokio Hotel music videos Live albums * Schrei – Live (Universal, 2006) * Zimmer 483 – Live in Europe (Universal, 2007) * Humanoid City Live (Cherry Tree, 2010) Documentaries * Leb' die Sekunde – Behind the Scenes (2005) * Tokio Hotel TV – Caught on Camera (2008) * Tokio Hotel – Hinter Die Welt (2017) *Netflix Exclusive: Kaulitz & Kaulitz (2024) ==Concert tours== Name Time Schrei Tour 2005–2006 Zimmer 483 Tour 2007 1000 Hotels World Tour 2008 Welcome to Humanoid City Tour 2010–2011 Feel It All World Tour 2015 Dream Machine Tour 2017–2018 Melancholic Paradise Tour 2019–2020 Beyond the World Tour 2023–2024 The Tour 2025 2025 ==Awards== Since the release of the single \"Durch den Monsun\" in 2005, Tokio Hotel have gone on to win 110 awards in various categories and countries. ;2005 Category Award Date Best Newcomer Comet Awards (Germany) 6 October Super Comet Comet Awards (Germany) 6 October Best Newcomer Eins Live Krone 24 November Best Pop National Act Bambi Awards 1 December Best Single Golden Penguin (Austria) Best Pop Golden Penguin (Austria) Rock Band 2005 Golden Penguin (Austria) ;2006 Category Award Date Album of the year Golden Penguin (Austria) 8 February Band of the year Golden Penguin (Austria) 8 February Song of the year – 'Der Letzte Tag' Golden Penguin (Austria) 8 February Best Newcomer Golden Penguin (Austria) 8 February Ausverkaufte Tourhalle Sold-out-Award of Königpilsener Arena 11 March Best Newcomer ECHO Awards (Germany) 12 March Best Newcomer Steiger Awards 25 March Pop National Radio Regenbogen (Germany) 31 March SuperBand Rock – Golden Otto Bravo Otto 6 May Music Award Bild OSGAR 22 May Best Newcomer International Popcorn Awards (Hungary) 26 May Best Newcomer Bravo Otto (Hungary) 24 June Best International Band Bravo Otto (Hungary) 24 June Best Newcomer Band Popkomm Bavarian Music Lion 21 September Best German Pop Band Goldene Stimmgabel 24 September Best Selling German Artist World Music Awards 15 November Best Pop National Act Bambi Awards 30 November Best Live Act Eins Live Krone 7 December Best Rock band MTV France ;2007 Category Award Date Single of the Year – Durch Den Monsun Golden Penguin Best Selling German Act – Album Schrei European Border Breakers Award 21 January European Border Breakers Award NRJ Awards 21 January Rock Award BZ-Kulturpreis 23 January Best Video National ECHO Awards (Germany) 25 March SuperBand Rock – Golden otto Bravo Otto Digital prize Festivalbar (Italy) 7 September Most Successful Group Rock International Goldene Stimmgabel 22 September Most Successful Popgroup International Goldene Stimmgabel 3 October Best Album TMF Awards (Belgium) 13 October Best Video TMF Awards (Belgium) 13 October Best New Artist TMF Awards (Belgium) 13 October Best Pop TMF Awards (Belgium) 13 October Best International Act MTV Europe Music Awards (Germany) 1 November Best band of the Year MTV Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award (Italy) 1 December ;2008 Category Award Date Band of the Year 2007 Golden Penguin (Austria) January Best International Band Rockbjörnen Awards (Sweden) 24 January Best Music National Goldene Kamera (Germany) 6 February Best Music Video Echo Awards (Germany) 15 February Best International Artist Emma Gala Awards (Finland) 8 March Best International Group Disney Channel Kids Award (Italy) 28 March Best Concert Hitkrant (Netherlands) May 2008 Best Mood Song – Monsoon Hitkrant (Netherlands) May 2008 Song that Stays in your Head – Monsoon Hitkrant (Netherlands) May 2008 Superband Rock – Silver Otto Bravo Otto 3 May Best Band MTV Italian Music Awards 17 May Best Number 1 of the Year with Monsoon MTV TRL Awards 17 May Best Band Comet Awards (Germany) 23 May Best Video – An Deiner Seite Comet Awards (Germany) 23 May Best Live Act Comet Awards (Germany) 23 May Super Comet Comet Awards (Germany) 23 May Best New Artist MTV Video Music Awards (USA) 7 September Fan Choice Best Entrance MTV Video Music Awards (USA) 7 September Best Male Artist International (Bill Kaulitz) TMF AwardsTMF AWARDS 2008 Winners TMF Awards 2008 Winners .
