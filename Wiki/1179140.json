 "text": "The Tepui poison frog or Chimantá poison frog (Anomaloglossus rufulus) is a frog. Scientists found it on the Chimantá Massif, in Bolivar, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in muddy dirt and wet places or in meadows with bromeliad plants that grow on the ground. People also see them in cracks in rock walls if there is enough water in the air. Scientists saw the frog between 2100 and 2640 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside Canaima National Park. ==Young== The male frog sits on the dead leaves on the ground or in cracks in the rock and calls to the female frogs during the day. Scientists have not seen the tadpoles. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN and from Venezuela say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Climate change, fires, and diseases could hurt this frog. Climate change could make it harder for this frog to have young. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
