 "text": "In February 2008, the Turkish army launched a major military operation in northern Iraq, in the mountainous region of Qandil, a strategic stronghold of the PKK. This offensive aimed to destroy the PKK's infrastructure, including training camps and logistical bases, in order to permanently weaken the Kurdish organization. ==Context of the operation== On February 21, 2008, the Turkish army deployed about 10,000 soldiers in northern Iraq, supported by air strikes and attack helicopters, with the aim of destroying the PKK bases in the Qandil Mountains. This offensive aimed to eliminate the infrastructure of the PKK and neutralize its fighters. ==Resistance and counterattack of the PKK== Despite intensive air strikes and ground incursions, the PKK resisted effectively. According to statements by PKK leader Murat KarayÄ±lan, Turkish forces have failed to achieve their objectives, and the PKK has inflicted significant losses on the Turkish army. The PKK claimed the destruction of a Turkish helicopter and the death of 130 Turkish soldiers. ==Consequences== The operation lasted about a week and was interrupted due to the resistance of the PKK and the difficulties encountered by the Turkish army. The withdrawal of Turkish troops was interpreted as a strategic victory for the PKK, which managed to maintain its presence in the region despite Turkish military efforts. This resistance strengthened the position of the PKK within the Kurdish population and highlighted the challenges faced by the Turkish army in the context of this asymmetric conflict.",
