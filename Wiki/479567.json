As Don Rosa explained, \"Duck\" is an understandably common name in Duckburg (just as \"Smith\" or \"Jones\" are common in the real-life United States) and does not necessarily identify a blood relation of Donald. 0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier are a secret-agent duo. April, May, and June Duck are the triplet nieces of Daisy Duck. Belle Duck is a plus-sized, tall and elegant duck lady. Daisy Duck is Donald's girlfriend. Huey, Dewey, and Louie sometimes call her \"Aunt Daisy\". It is unclear if she is their real aunt. Darkwing Duck is the protagonist of a TV series named after him. He is most likely not related to Donald because \"Darkwing Duck\" is the character's superhero identity. His name in private life is Drake Mallard. Dexter Duck, like Gladstone Gander, competes with Donald Duck to get Daisy Duck's attention. Dickie Duck () was introduced as Goldie O'Gilt's granddaughter. But in the story \"Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park\" by Romano Scarpa she calls Huey, Dewey and Louie cuginetti (small/young cousins) and then cugini (cousins). This might mean that she and Donald's nephews share the same surname in English language because of a kinship. Dimwitty Duck originally appears as an assistant of Donald Duck. Hustler Duck is an obscure character that works as a marketing man. Moby Duck appears to be a relative of Donald's. Their relationship is never specifically described. His name is a spoof of Moby-Dick. The identity of Huey, Dewey, and Louie's father is something of a mystery. The character does not appear in any stories. ==References== ==Other websites== * Don Rosa's Duck family tree * Al Hubbard Category:Disney characters",
