 "text": "A tornado emergency is a stronger wording of tornado warnings used by the National Weather Service in the United States. It is used when a large, powerful tornado is in an area with a lot of people. It means that a very large amount of damage and a high possibility of a lot of deaths are expected. The term was first used on May 3, 1999 when an F5 tornado hit just south of Oklahoma City in Moore. Between 5:30 and 6:00 PM, a large, powerful tornado was heading for Oklahoma City, leading to the first tornado emergency. == Tornado safety == If people are in a tornado's path, they should follow these safety tips: * Go underground. * If there is no floor beneath your house, go to the nearest storm shelter, safe room, or go to the center of the house and stay away from windows and doors. * If you are outside, get into a pit or somewhere low, cover your head and neck. * Bring a disaster preparedness kit which includes: *:* water, a gallon per person per day *:* food, non- perishable and can opener *:* battery or hand crank radio *:* flashlight and batteries *:* whistle *:* dust mask for every person *:* moist hand wipes and garbage bags *:* prescription medication and glasses *:* infant formula and diapers *:* pet food, extra water, collar and leash *:* first aid kit and first aid book *:* important documents such as identification, insurance policies and bank information *:* cash and coins *:* fire extinguisher *:* hygiene items and feminine supplies *:* blankets for each individual *:* change of clothing for each individual and sturdy shoes *:* paper and writing utensil *:* books, games and stuffed animals for children == Tornado emergency example == 377 WFUS53 KPAH 110326 TORPAH KYC083-110415- /O.NEW.KPAH.TO.W.0038.211211T0326Z-211211T0415Z/ BULLETIN - EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED Tornado Warning National Weather Service Paducah KY 926 PM CST Fri Dec 10 2021 ...TORNADO EMERGENCY FOR Mayfield...
