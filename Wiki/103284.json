On 15 August 1327 it got its town charter from Louis II, Bishop of Münster. The settlement was founded by reason of two old merchant roads crossing nearby, as well as a ford crossing the river Ems. Frankish soldiers secured this strategic point by a barrack yard at first. Later a church and more buildings were added to this outpost. In the end of Thirty Years' War the city burned down almost completely. Swedish and Hessian troops besieged imperial soldiers who entrenched themselves in Rheine. On 20th/21st September and 19th October 1647 glowing cannonballs set fire to the city, 365 houses got razed. During the industrialisation textile industry prospered. It continued to be an important economical factor until the second half of the 20th century. Today engineering industries and services form the largest part of economy in Rheine. == Twin towns == * Borne (Netherlands) -- since 1983 * Bernburg (Saale) (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) -- since 1990 * Leiria (Portugal) -- since 1996 * Trakai (Lithuania) -- since 1996 ==References== == Other websites == * Official site * Association for Rheine's twin towns Category:Towns in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Steinfurt (district)",
