 "text": "Nestorianism is a movement within Christianity. The idea behind the doctrine is that Jesus has two different natures: the man Jesus and the son of God (Greek: Logos). Perhaps the most prominent supporter of the idea was Nestorius, an archbishop of Constantinople who lived about from 380 to 450 AD. The Council of Ephesus condemned his view in 431. That led to a split of the church into the Assyrian Church of the East and the Byzantine Church. For that reason, the Assyrian Church of the East is sometimes called \"Nestorian\". It holds the view that Christ has two essences (qnome), which are united in one person (parsopa). The only two churches that teach Nestorianism today are the Assyrian Church of the East and the Church of the East & Abroad. Category:Ancient Christianity",
