 "text": "The South Indian frog, small-handed frog, brown leaping frog, or half-webbed leaping frog (Indirana semipalmata) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground near the kinds of plants that grow near streams and on dead leaves on the ground. This frog lives in forests that have evergreen trees in them and in swamps. It can live in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have seen this frog on coffee farms. People have seen this frog between 96 and 1107 meters above sea level. ==Young== The frog lays eggs on wet rocks. The frog's tadpoles do not live in the water. Instead, they live on wet rocks next to streams. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger. People cut down the forests where it lives to build farms, for example for coffee. Taking good rocks out of the ground and making things for visitors can also hurt this frog. Sometimes people go into the forest and cut some wood to use themselves. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, but they do not know how much danger the frog is in from the fungus. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
