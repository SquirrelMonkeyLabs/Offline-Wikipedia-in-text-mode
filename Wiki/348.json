For example, it is said the bottom of the foot is a person's lowest end, and the top of the head is a person's highest end. If the distance between the bottom of a person's foot and the top of that person's head is 64 inches, then that person's height is 64 inches. Height is measured in 3D objects. 2D objects do not have height; they only have length and width. ==Related pages== * Depth * Elevation * Volume Category:Physical quantity",
