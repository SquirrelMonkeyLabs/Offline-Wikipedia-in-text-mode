 "text": "Martin Gardner wrote 288 consecutive \"Mathematical Games\" columns for the magazine Scientific American. The first one was in January 1957. The last one was in December 1980. After 1980 other people wrote some of the columns. Gardner created 9 more columns during that time. The last Mathematical Games column appeared in June 1986. The list below shows all the 297 columns that Gardner wrote. Sometimes Scientific American put pictures about the columns on the front cover of the magazine. There were twelve such covers.
