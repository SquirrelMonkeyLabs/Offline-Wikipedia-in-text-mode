 "text": "The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum is a sports arena in Uniondale, New York. The arena opened on February 11, 1972. It was the home to the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1972 until 2015 and again from 2018 until 2021. The arena is commonly known as Nassau Coliseum or The Coliseum. The arena was also notable for hosting the first part of the World Wrestling Federation's WrestleMania 2 in 1986. In addition, it has also hosted WWE's SummerSlam in August 2002, The Great American Bash in July 2008, and WWE Fatal 4-Way on June 20, 2010. It also hosted All Elite Wrestling (AEW)'s pay- per-view Worlds End in 2023. The arena was also the home of the New York Nets from 1972 to 1977. The Islanders moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn after their lease of the Coliseum expired at the end of the 2014-2015 season. When the Islanders moved, the Coliseum would not have a permanent tenant after 2015 and leaves the future of the Coliseum in doubt. The Islanders decided to return and split half of the 2018â€“19 NHL season between the Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. They would continue to split games between arena the next season until returning to play the remainder of games at the Coliseum until their new arena, the UBS Arena was built. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Sports buildings in New York (state) Category:WrestleMania host Category:1972 establishments in New York (state)",
