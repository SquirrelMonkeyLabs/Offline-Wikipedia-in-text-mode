In the past, Thonburi was the capital of Thailand, but later, the capital was moved to a place called Rattanakosin Island, which is on the eastern side of the river. ==History== Thonburi was created in 1767 by King Taksin after Ayutthaya, the ancient capital, was destroyed. In 1782, King Rama I, who started the Chakri dynasty, moved the capital to the other side of the river. This place was called Rattanakosin. Later, Rattanakosin was renamed Bangkok. ==References== Category:Bangkok Category:Establishments in Thailand Category:Settlements established in the 18th century",
