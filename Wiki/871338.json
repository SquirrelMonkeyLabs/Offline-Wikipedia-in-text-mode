 "text": "The jaugar leaf frog or jaguar monkey frog (Pithecopus palliatus) is a frog that lives in Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia. Scientists think it might also live in Colombia. People have seen it between 100 and 400 meters above sea level. The adult frog is 37.7 to 43.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 38.8 to 49.1 mm long. This frog lays eggs near bodies of water that are not there all year, for example flooded places. They lay eggs on leaves near the water. Then the tadpoles fall off the leaves into the water. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
