 "text": "The IP code or ingress protection code refers to a standardized rating system used to measure the level of protection provided by an enclosure against the intrusion of solid objects and liquids. It is particularly relevant in the context of electronic devices, outdoor equipment, and industrial machinery. The IP rating consists of two digits, each representing a specific type of protection. The first digit indicates the degree of protection against solid objects, such as dust, dirt, and accidental contact. It ranges from 0 to 6, with higher numbers indicating a higher level of protection. The second digit signifies the degree of protection against liquids, such as water and moisture. It ranges from 0 to 9, with higher numbers indicating a higher level of protection. A rating of 0 denotes no protection, while a rating of 9 indicates protection against powerful water jets or submersion for extended periods. By referring to the IP rating of a device or equipment, you can determine its ability to withstand various environmental conditions. For example, a waterproof Bluetooth speaker with an IP68 rating implies that it is dust-tight and can be submerged in water up to a certain depth without being damaged. ==References== Category:Technology",
