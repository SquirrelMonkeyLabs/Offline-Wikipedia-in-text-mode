There are three main gods in Hinduism, or Sanātana Dharma. They are, Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh, or Lord Shiva. Lord Vishnu has 24 avatars. These avatars play an important role in Hinduism. They represent Vishnu himself. == Traditions == The followers of Sanātana Dharma, or Sanātanīs, have a lot of traditions, as India is the most diverse country in the world. There are 365 festivals in Sanātana Dharma, but because of economic reasons, only a handful of the major ones are celebrated. These religious festivals include Uttarayan, Holi, and Diwali/Deepawali, along with many others. Category:Hinduism",
