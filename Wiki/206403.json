The whole family work together to build Josh a ladder and deliver it him on Christmas morning. Later, Cliff's first grade brother Brad, drives his bicycle into an ambulance and dies. The family spends the next Christmas at a resort trying to adjust to the loss of Brad but the trip does not seem to work. Their spirits rise during a New Year's party at Aunt Pat's house. When they arrive at the party Josh steps by mistake into Dad's special fig pudding. Dad removes the shoe, smooths down the pudding, and swears the children to secrecy.

They all laugh when the real story of the shoe is told. ==Style== Fig Pudding is written using an episodic plot style. ==Reception== Chris Sherman in his review for Booklist said that \"Fletcher captures perfectly the humor, irritations, and sadness of life in a large, close-knit family and makes Cliff a sympathetic and thoughtful narrator, occasionally bewildered by his siblings' antics but always a completely believable older brother. The comedy in the final chapter will leave readers recalling hilarious family disasters of their own.\" Elizabeth Devereaux in her review for Publishers Weekly said this novel \"neatly blends the humor and frustrations of growing up in a large family.\" ==Notes== == Outside websites== *Ralph Fletcher's website Category:1995 books Category:American young adult novels Category:Books by Ralph Fletcher",
