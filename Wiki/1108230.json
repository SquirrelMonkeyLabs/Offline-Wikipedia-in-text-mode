 "text": "Chlamydia Psittaci is a lethal bacterial species of chlamydia. It lives in cells and causes respiratory psittacosis (also known as ornithosis) in humans. It may infect other mammals (such as farm animals and poultry) in outbreaks. It can infect birds in certain parts of the world. Humans mainly get the disease from infected parrots. Because the disease it causes usually starts with a fever or flu, it might also be called parrot fever. == References == Category:Gram-negative bacteria",
