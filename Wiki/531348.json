Internet safety is mainly taught in primary and secondary schools and focuses on making sure children know that: * you should not share your personal information on the internet, * you should think before you write comments about people - how it could affect them, * you should always tell an adult if there is something that upsets you, * you should not meet someone you have talked to on the internet without an adult. Choose a strong password with different characters and numbers. There are more ways to secure your devices when surfing through Internet, you can use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) which ensures secure network access, it is usually recommended to use a paid service rather than a free service.
