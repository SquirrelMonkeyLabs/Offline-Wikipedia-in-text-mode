 "text": "Revolution (2024) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place March 3, 2024 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was the fifth Revolution event held by AEW. The main event saw Sting and Darby Allin defeat The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) in a tornado tag team match to keep their AEW World Tag Team Championships. Sting then retired with an undefeated record in AEW. During a press conference after the pay-per-view, AEW president Tony Khan announced that he had vacated the championships. He also announced that there would be a tournament to crown the new champions. The event is notable for Sting competing in the final match of his career. He would retire from in-ring competition afterwards. Kyle O'Reilly also made his return from injury at the show. ==Matches== No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Bang Bang Scissor Gang (Max Caster, Anthony Bowens, Billy Gunn, Austin Gunn, Colten Gunn, and Jay White) defeated Jeff Jarrett, Satnam Singh, Jay Lethal, Willie Mack, and Private Party (Isiah Kassidy and Marq Quen) (with Sonjay Dutt and Karen Jarrett) 12-man tag team match 12:25 2 Kris Statlander and Willow Nightingale defeated Julia Hart and Skye Blue Tag team match 13:30 3 Christian Cage (c) (with Killswitch, Mother Wayne, and \"The Prodigy\" Nick Wayne) defeated Daniel Garcia Singles match for the AEW TNT Championship 16:50 4 Eddie Kingston (c) defeated Bryan Danielson Singles match for the Continental Crown Championship (AEW Continental Championship, ROH World Championship, and NJPW Strong Openweight Championship) 19:45 5 Wardlow (with Adam Cole, Mike Bennett, and Matt Taven) defeated Chris Jericho, Powerhouse Hobbs, Lance Archer (with Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts), Hook, Brian Cage (with Prince Nana), Magnus, and Dante Martin All- Star Scramble match 15:45 6 Roderick Strong defeated Orange Cassidy (c) Singles match for the AEW International Championship 12:45 7 Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley and Claudio Castagnoli) defeated FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) Tag team match 21:50 8 \"Timeless\" Toni Storm (c) (with Mariah May and Luther) defeated Deonna Purrazzo Singles match for the AEW Women's World Championship 12:15 9 Will Ospreay defeated Konosuke Takeshita Singles match 22:00 10 Samoa Joe (c) defeated \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Swerve Strickland (with Prince Nana) Three-way match for the AEW World Championship 19:40 11 Sting and Darby Allin (c) (with Ric Flair, Garrett Borden, and Steven Borden Jr.) defeated The Young Bucks (Matthew and Nicholas Jackson) Tornado tag team match for the AEW World Tag Team Championship 21:25 ==References== Category:2024 in sports Category:AEW Revolution Category:Greensboro, North Carolina Category:Sports in North Carolina",
