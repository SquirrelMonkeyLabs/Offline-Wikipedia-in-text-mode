There are different estimates, but they make up a small percentage, between 0.22% and 2.2%, of Pakistan's population. Pakistan has the largest number of Ahmadis in the world, numbering between 2 to 5 million.4.910.000: James Minahan: Encyclopedia of the stateless nations. Ethnic and national groups around the world. Greenwood Press . Westport 2002, page 52 Rabwah in Punjab used to be their main headquarters before it was moved to England. The Ahmadiyya movement started in Qadian, and after Pakistan gained independence, Ahmadis moved to Rabwah. Some well-known Pakistanis who were Ahmadis include Abdus Salam, the country's first Nobel Prize winner, and Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, Pakistan's first foreign minister. Ahmadis in Pakistan mainly live in the Punjab province, but you can also find them in big cities like Karachi, Islamabad, and Peshawar. Most Ahmadis belong to a united group called the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community (AMC), led by the Khalifa. There's another group called the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, but it's smaller, representing less than 0.2% of all Ahmadis in Pakistan and the entire world. == References == Category:Religion in Pakistan",
