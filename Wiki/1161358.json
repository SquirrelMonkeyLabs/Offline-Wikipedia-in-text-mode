 "text": "The Tomb of Kha and Merit is the chapel and burial of the ancient Egyptian foreman Kha and his wife Merit. At the foot of the cliffs across from their church lay the tomb of Kha and Merit. Since of its location, ancient robbers were unable to find the entrance since it was swiftly covered by material from landslides and later tomb construction. The undisturbed tomb was found in February 1906, during excavations conducted for the Italian Archaeological Mission under the direction of Egyptologist Ernesto Schiaparelli. == References == * * * Category:Ancient Egypt",
