 "text": "Amphetamine mixed salts (also known as amphetamine and dextroamphetamine mixed salts, amphetamine salt combo, or simply amphetamine salts) is a medication used to help attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is sold under the brand name Adderall. The drug contains a mixture of the salts of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Both of these salts act as stimulants. The drug therefore helps people stay alert and concentrate on what they are doing. The downside of this medication is decreased appetite, alongside other side effects. The sustained-release (or extended-release) formulation is sold under the brand name Adderall XR. This formulation is designed to provide therapeutic effect and plasma concentrations. This is the same as taking two doses 4 hours apart.
