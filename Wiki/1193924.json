 "text": "The X-Group Culture (ca. C.E.300-C.E.600) was an ancient Nubian civilization that existed in Lower Nubia. Cemetery excavations revealed that the civilization stretched from the Dodekaschoinos in the north to Delgo in the south. George A. Reisner coined the term X-Group Culture for lack of a more exact historical definition.G. Mokhtar, General History of Africa II. Ancient Civilizations of Africa, 1981, , p. 326. This anonymous type of terminology has been replaced by the term Ballana culture due to the increase of knowledge and new findings in Qustul and Ballana as proposed by Bruce Trigger.Bruce Trigger, History and Settlement in Lower Nubia. New Haven: Yale University Publications in Anthropology, 1965. According to Egyptologists Keith Seele and Bruce Williams, the burials of X-Group are evidence of an evolution from the earlier Meroitic graves to those at Ballana, which were principally Nubian in origin along with the majority of the items found within them. In one royal tomb, a queen was discovered, accompanied by seventeen human sacrifices. Another royal tomb contained a body of a man who was likely a king, offerings of food and drinks, and his personal items, such as a crown, board game and weapons. ==Gallery== File:Saddle, Nubia, Qustul, Cemetery L, Noubadian, X-Group culture, c. 375 AD, described as the world's oldest known saddle to use a frame - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC08071.JPG|Saddle with frame, File:Sandals, Qustul, Nubia, Cemetery Q, Area QC, tomb 49, Early X-Group, 370-410 AD, leather - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC08069.JPG|Sandals from Qustul, File:Nubian pottery, Lower Nubia, Prague Kinsky, 141813.jpg|Pottery from X-Group burial, Wadi Qitna and Kalabsha South ==References== Category:History of Nubia",
