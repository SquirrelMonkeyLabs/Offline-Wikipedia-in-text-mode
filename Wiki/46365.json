 "text": "Yun Bo-seon (Korea:윤보선, August 26, 1897 – July 18, 1990) was the President of South Korea from 1960 to 1962. He was born in Asan, South Chungcheong province, Yun graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1930. He entered politics after Japanese occupation ended in 1945, with Syngman Rhee being his mentor. In 1948, Yun was made mayor of Seoul by Rhee. A year later, he was made the Minister of Commerce and Industry. Soon, he started to disagree with Rhee's authoritarian policies. He then served as president of the Red Cross Society, before being elected to the National Assembly in 1954. A year later, he founded the opposition Democratic Party along with several others. After Rhee's government was ousted by a student-led pro-democracy uprising, Yun was elected president on August 13, 1960. He was merely a figurehead, as South Korea had switched to a parliamentary system in response to the authoritarian excesses of Rhee's regime. After Park Chung Hee's coup in 1961, he stayed on briefly to provide legitimacy to the regime, but resigned on March 22, 1962. He opposed Park's authoritarian rule and ran for president twice in 1963 and 1967, losing each time. After receiving suspended sentences several times for anti-government activities, Yun retired from politics in 1980 and focused primarily on cultural activities until his death from diabetes and high blood pressure. He died in 1990. == Book == * 《Autobiography, Road of thorns the national salvation (구국의 가시밭길)》(1967) * 《Select the days of lonely(외로운 선택의 나날들)》(1991) == Prize == * Sharon Big-Merit(무궁화 대훈장) * In-Cheon Cultural Awardti Prize was the Kim Seong Soo's Memorim ==Related pages== * Yun Chi-ho * Chang Myon * Jang Jun-Ha * Yun Chi-Young == References == == Other websites == *Cheongwadae profile Category:Presidents of South Korea Category:1897 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Mayors of Seoul Category:Anti-communists",
