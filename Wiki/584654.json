However, other people such as teachers believe that fidget spinners are a distraction. This is because teachers and their students get distracted by the noise or the hand motions that come with the fidget spinner package. Fidget spinners are popular among young students who collect them, sell them, trade them and play with them. Fidget spinners come in many colors and styles, and many shapes and sizes. Fidget spinners are sold at toy stores, gas stations, and convenience stores. Often, entrepreneurial students will sell them on the playground or at the bus stop. == Facts about fidget spinners == Catherine Hettinger, a chemical engineer, was first credited by some news stories to have been the inventor of the fidget spinner, including by media outlets such as The Guardian, The New York Times and the New York Post.
