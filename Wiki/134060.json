 "text": "A country's foreign policy (also called the international relations policy) is a set of goals about how the country will work with other countries economically, politically, socially and militarily. It includes such matters as international trade, foreign aid, military alliances, and war. Foreign policy also involves dealing with groups that are not countries but that are still important. These are called non-state actors, and might include religious groups, large companies, or even terrorist groups. The study of foreign relations is known as foreign policy analysis (FPA) and the work is called diplomacy. Most counties have a foreign minister who directs these things, with help from other officials. Foreign policy is basically the way a government deals with other nations. The policy and behavior of other states, as well as domestic consideration and interests is what influences the development of foreign policy. According to Lumen Learning, foreign policy consists of self-interest strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its national interests and to achieve its own goals through relations with other countries. This means that foreign policies are arrangements made by the government to benefit them. == References == Category:International relations",
