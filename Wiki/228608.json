The species blooms anytime from April to August. The color of the flowers are typically white. The plant needs sunlight from the full sun, meaning direct sunlight. The species is an herbaceous plant, meaning it has leaves and stems that die down at the end of the growing season to the soil level and has no woody stem above the ground. ==Habitat== The species is native to Central Europe and Siberia. ==Toxicity== Despite being used in cakes and corsages, the species is commonly feared to be poisonous. The toxicity is said to be due to saponins. The poisonous parts of the plant are claimed to be the flowers, with other parts of the plant also being poisonous when they are dry. The species can cause eye irritation, sinus irritation, or asthma after the plant is repeatedly handled. The plant can also cause minor skin irritation that only lasts for a few minutes.potentially unreliable source It is known that the roots of this species and other members of the genus gypsophila do in fact contain saponin. A study has been done which suggests that saponins are produced only in the root and stay in the root and do not move to other parts of the plant. ==References== Category:Caryophyllaceae",
