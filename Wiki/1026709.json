It is similar to X (formerly Twitter). Threads works \"adjacent\" to Instagram, users need to have an Instagram account and use their Instagram login details. When Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, Meta workers talked about the creation of \"Instagram Notes\", a text-based feature of Instagram. They also talked about creating a separate and text-focused app, that helped create the idea of Threads. == History == On April 19, 2022, Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion dollars. On July 10, 2023, Threads became the fastest growing apps in history. Threads reached 100 million users in just five days. Threads quickly became available in 100 countries, but until December 14, 2023 had delayed its launch in the European Union as it waited to be cleared by the European Commission for its data collection policies. On October 30, 2024, Threads reached 275 million users. == Related pages == *Instagram *Fediverse == References == == Other websites == * * Category:2023 establishments in the United States Category:American social networking websites Category:Photography Category:Meta Platforms applications",
