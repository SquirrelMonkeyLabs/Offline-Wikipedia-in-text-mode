 "text": "Mobile Golf is a game exclusively released in Japan on the Game Boy Color. In terms of gameplay and storyline, it is very similar to the English Mario Golf. Like Mario Golf, it has four human characters to choose from at the beginning. The player can train them to gain experience and improve their stats. Players can also unlock characters for use in story mode and other modes by beating them in a match. This includes several human characters from Mario Golf and the four champions: Bean, Rozary, Powert, and Bird. The Mobile Adapter GB, whose service was active at the time of release, could be used to play multiplayer games within a mobile phone network. It can unlock other playable characters, such as Mario, Peach, Yoshi, and Foreman Spike. Category:Game Boy Color games",
