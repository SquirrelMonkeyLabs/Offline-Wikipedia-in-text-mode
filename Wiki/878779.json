 "text": "A footpad was a type of robber who attacked people who were travelling, they specialised in pedestrian victims. They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I to the 1800s. They were thought to be socially inferior to highwaymen (who robbed on horseback), often considered low criminals, opposed to highwaymen who would sometimes become infamous as well as famous. This term was commonly used from the 16th century to the 19th century, but slowly fell out of use. Footpads always operated on foot, and robbed people after scaring them. Usually operating in the dark, they used this to their advantage by frightening the victim and getting away unseen; some of these crimes were brutally violent, although most committed them out of need and preferred more passive methods. They opted for this method due to the high price of horses and the incognito factor of the dark. These activities usually took place in gangs. == References == Category:Robbery",
