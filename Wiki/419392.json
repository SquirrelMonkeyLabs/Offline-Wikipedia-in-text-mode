 "text": "A mixtape (or mixed-tape) is any compilation of songs recorded onto a cassette tape or other storage medium. A mixtape usually shows the kind of music that the person who made it likes to listen to. It can range from a randomly selected list of favourite songs, to a conceptual mix of songs of the same genre or mood. Making mixtapes may be considered an art form. Since the 1990s, the term \"mixtape\" can also describe releases used to promote one or more new musical artists, or as a pre-release by more established artists to promote upcoming albums. ==References== Category:Audio technology Category:Compilation albums",
