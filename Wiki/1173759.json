 "text": "The El Vivero rocket frog (Aromobates haydeeae) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. ==Home== The adult frogs live in clear streams in cloud forests in the Andes mountains. People have also seen them in grasslands with kikuyo grass in them. Scientists saw the frog between 1825 and 2670 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog might live in Parque Nacional Los PÃ¡ramos. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on land. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for people to raise animals. Scientists believe the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could give the frogs the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. They also think climate change and ultraviolet light could hurt the frogs, eggs, and tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
