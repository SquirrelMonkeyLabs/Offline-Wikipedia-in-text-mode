 "text": "The Nashville Predators are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. They play in the National Hockey League (NHL). Their name is sometimes shortened to the \"Preds.\" They play in Bridgestone Arena (formerly named Nashville Arena, Gaylord Entertainment Center, and Sommet Center). Their logo is a reference to a partial Smilodon skeleton that was found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971, during the construction of the First American National Bank. The franchise held a vote with the fans to choose a team name. The three candidates that were chosen were: The \"Ice Tigers\", \"Fury\", and \"Attack\". Another choice, \"Predators\", was added to the vote. Predators won the vote, and the new franchise was named the Nashville Predators. == References == ==Other websites== *Official website Category:1997 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Tennessee",
