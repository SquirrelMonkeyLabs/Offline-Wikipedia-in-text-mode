 "text": "The 19th of April Movement (), or M-19, was a Colombian guerrilla movement. After the guerrilla movement broke apart, it became a political party, the M-19 Democratic Alliance (), or AD/M-19. The group was created after the possibly rigged presidential elections of 19 April 1970. The group's ideas were seen as nationalism, but its main goal was to open up democracy in Colombia. In the 1980s, the group had about 1,500 and 2,000 members, making it the second largest guerrilla group in Colombia after the FARC. Today, the group is no longer active however senior members later became politicians and members of Humane Colombia. President-elect Gustavo Petro was a member of this group. ==References== Category:20th century in Colombia",
