 "text": "__NOTOC__ This is a list of places in Switzerland having standing links to local communities in other countries. In many cases, these completely ceremonial associations, especially when formalized by the local governments, are called by the fallacious name of \"town twinning\" – though other terms, such as \"sister city\" and \"partner town\" are far more accurate. While most of the places included in this list are cities or towns, the list also contains villages, districts, counties, cantons, provinces, etc. with similar links. The list includes twin towns and sister cities (Partnergemeinden, Partnerstädte, villes ou communes jumelles) of towns in Switzerland linked by a sister-city agreement (Städtepartnerschaft or Gemeindepartnerschaft; jumelage de villes) or friendship agreements (Freundschaft or amitié). A few Swiss municipalities participating in projects arranged by the Swiss organizations Patenschaft für Berggemeinden (Parrainage suisse pour communes de montagne) are included. The program arranges sponsorships of municipalities in the Swiss Alps by other Swiss municipalities. The twinning may be a private initiative (e.g. between Zürich and San Francisco) or an initiative of the city authorities.
