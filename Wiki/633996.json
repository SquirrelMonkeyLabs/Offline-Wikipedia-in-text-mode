I don't want people to have to live in that kind of environment. They are left to rot, basically, and not treated like the human beings they are. My work consists of advocating for the rights of people with disabilities, promoting community services, and closing down institutions. I want to write more.\"\"Ruth Sienkiewicz-Mercer.\" Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2014.
