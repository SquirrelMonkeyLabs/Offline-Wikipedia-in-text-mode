 "text": "In evangelical Christianity, the Sinners prayer is a short prayer. It admits sin and asks Jesus to save. The Sinner's prayer (also called the Consecration prayer and Salvation prayer) is an Evangelicalism Baptist term referring to any Prayerof Repentance, prayed by individuals who feel Sin in their lives and have the desire to form or renew a personal relationship. This prayer is not mandatory but, for some, functions as a way to communicate with and understand their relationship with God through Jesus christ. It is a popular prayer in evangelical circles. It is not intended as Liturgical like a Creed or a confiteor said or chanted within the Catholic Mass, but rather, is intended to be an act of initial conversion to Christianity. It is roughly analogous to the Catholic Act of Contrition, though the theology behind each is markedly different, due to the intrinsically different views of salvation between Catholicism and Protestantism. While some Christians see reciting the Sinner's prayer as the moment defining one's salvation, others see it as a beginning step of one's lifelong faith journey. ==References== Category:Christianity",
