It was started by Nur Misuari in 1969. The MNLF fights against the Philippine government for the independence of the Bangsamoro Land. Over the years there have been several attempts to achieve peace between the MNLF and the government. In 1976 a treaty was arranged by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation but this failed. In 1986 President Corazon Aquino met with Misuari, and in 1989 the area was given a level of autonomy. President Fidel Ramos arranged a peace deal in 1996 which allowed Misuari to be elected as regional governor. Misuari led an uprising against the federal government in 2001, but this failed and he was sent to prison. The MNLF says that the territory of Bangsamoro Land covers Sulu, Mindanao, Palawan and Sabah (in Malaysia). The MNLF is an observer member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Long Struggle to Silence the Guns of Rebellion: A Review of the Long and Winding Trail to the Elusive Peace Agreements by The CenSEI Report * Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) (Facebook page) Category:Islamic organizations Category:National liberation movements Category:Nationalist organizations in Asia Category:Rebel militia groups in Asia Category:1960s establishments in the Philippines Category:1969 establishments in Asia",
