 "text": "A reduction is when a doctor moves an injured bone back into its correct position. == Description == When a bone breaks, it becomes dislocated or its angle changes, which could lead to deformity after healing without reduction. Since the procedure can be painful, reduction is usually performed under anesthetic. Afterwards, X-rays are used to make sure the reduction was done properly. Finally, a cast or traction is used to keep it in place while it heals. == Types == Reductions can be either open or closed. If the body is cut into so doctors can see the bones they are doing surgery on, that is an open reduction. Otherwise, it is a closed reduction. Category:Surgery",
