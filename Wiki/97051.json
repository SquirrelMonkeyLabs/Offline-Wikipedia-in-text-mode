It was built in 1969 and is one of the tallest buildings in the world. ==Name change== On February 12, 2018, John Hancock Insurance requested that its name and logos throughout the building's interior be removed immediately; John Hancock had not had a naming-rights deal with the skyscraper's owners since 2013. Until a new naming-rights deal is finalized, the skyscraper will be known as \"875 North Michigan Avenue\".http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/ct-biz-john-hancock- center-name-ryan-ori-20180212-story.html \"John Hancock Center skyscraper losing its iconic name\".
