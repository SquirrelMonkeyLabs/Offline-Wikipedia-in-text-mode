 "text": "Bicycle lighting is illumination attached to bicycles. The idea is to improve the visibility of the bicycle in poor lighting conditions.That way, the bicycle and its rider can be seen more clearly. Another purpose is to illuminate reflective materials such as cat's eyes and traffic signs. A third purpose may be to illuminate the road so that the rider can see the way ahead. This requires much more luminous flux and more power. Many countries require one or more bicycle lights to be fitted to bicycles ridden at night. Usually, this is a white light in the front and a red light at the back. This is the same as with other vehicles. Category:Cycling",
