 "text": "Barameda (Indigenous Australian language: \"fish trap\") is an extinct genus of rhizodont from the Tournaisian of Australia. The species: * †Barameda decipiens * †Barameda mitchelli == Description == Barameda had an elongated and thick body typical of Carboniferous rhizodonts, for powerful swimming and out-powering any prey larger than itself. It was covered with moderately thin, cycloidal scales. == Paleoecology == Barameda was probably a benthic ambush predator, attacking other fishes and possibly early tetrapods. It used a grab- and-drag strategy, using its fangs to snag prey and either thrash them, or simply drag them down into the water. == References == # Long, John A.
