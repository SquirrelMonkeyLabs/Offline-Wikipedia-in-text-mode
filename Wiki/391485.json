 "text": "The Division of Yarra was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It was located in inner eastern suburban Melbourne, and was named after the Yarra River. It originally covered the suburbs of Abbotsford, Collingwood, Richmond and part of Fitzroy. By 1969, it no longer covered Abbotsford or Fitzroy, but included Burnley and Hawthorn. Yarra was one of the original 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It was abolished in 1969. ==Members== Member Party Term Frank Tudor Labor 1901–1922 James Scullin Labor 1922–1949 Stan Keon Labor 1949–1955 Labor (Anti- Communist) 1955–1955 Jim Cairns Labor 1955–1969 It was a very safe Labor seat.
