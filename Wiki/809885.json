Harry uses magic to defeat them but his aunt and uncle blame him for the attack. Harry meets the Order of the Phoenix, a group of good witches and wizards who want to fight against the Death Eaters. His godfather, Sirius Black, is one of the leaders. The Order tells Harry that the Ministry of Magic is trying to convince the magical community that Lord Voldemort is dead, but in reality, he came back to life in the previous movie. Another school year at Hogwarts begins. A new teacher, Dolores Umbridge, has been appointed to work at the school by the Ministry of Magic to make sure that the school does not discuss Voldemort's return. Professor Umbridge bans the use of defensive spells and refuses to teach the students how to protect themselves from evil magic. Frustrated, Harry Potter and his friends, Ron and Hermione create a secret club named \"Dumbledore's Army\". Many other students join Dumbledore's Army and they learn defensive spells together. At night, Bellatrix Lestrange (Sirius Black's cousin) and several other Death Eaters (Voldemort's followers) escape a high-security prison named Azkaban. Professor Umbridge eventually finds out about Dumbledore's Army. The Ministry tries to arrest Dumbledore but he escapes. Umbridge takes full control over the school. Harry and Hermione lead Umbridge into a forest, where she is kidnapped by a group of centaurs. Harry has a dream of Sirius Black being tortured by Voldemort inside the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna and Neville travel to the Department of Mysterious. Harry realises that the dream wasn't real and that Sirius isn't there. They find an prophecy which contains information about Harry and Voldemort's bond. The group are attacked by Death Eaters but they are rescued by Sirius and the Order of the Phoenix. A battle takes place and Bellatrix manages to kill Sirius Black. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort arrive and fight each other. The Minister of Magic enters the room just as Voldemort escapes. The Ministry is forced to admit Voldemort has returned. Harry must now come to terms with what the prophecy said: \"neither can live while the other survives\", in reference to Harry and Voldemort. ==References== Category:2007 fantasy movies Category:2000s American fantasy movies Category:British fantasy movies Harry Potter 5 Category:Warner Bros. movies Category:Movies based on books Harry Potter 5 Category:Movies composed by John Williams Category:Movies set in London Category:Movies set in Scotland",
