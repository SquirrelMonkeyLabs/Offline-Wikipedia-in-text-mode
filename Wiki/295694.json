 "text": "The International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is held every May 17. == Origins == On the 17th of May in 1990, the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases, where it was listed as a mental illness. International Day Against Homophobia started off in Canada in 2003 as the National day against Homophobia, and was initiated by Fondation Emergence . In 2006 The Declaration of Montreal (pronounced in Montreal during the first Outgames) demanded all countries to recognize this day, and several countries, including the European Union and Brazil have already recognized it formally. In 2014 Fondation Emergence changed the day's name from \"international day against homophobia\" to \"international day against homohobia and transphobia\" in order to include trans realities to its mission. As well in 2015 the day's name to \"international day against homophobia, transphobia and biphobia\" in order to include bisexual realities to the mission. == Campaigns == Each year, since 2003, Fondation Emergence launches a campaign to fight homophobia and transphobia in the world with a particular angle such as homoparentality, allies, age and trans people. Their last campaign has been translated into 18 languages. ==Related pages== *Homophobia *Transphobia *Biphobia *Transgender Day of Remembrance *Declaration of Montreal ==References== Category:LGBT events Category:May observances",
