 "text": "The 2020–21 Indian farmers' protest was a protest that took place in India. It was caused when Parliament passed three new laws. A lot of people think that these laws will hurt farmers and put them under the control of big farming corporations. Many of the farmers who protested were from Punjab and Haryana states. On 1 December 2021, India officially repealed the controversial agricultural act that caused the protests. ==References== Farmers' protest Category:2020 in Asia Category:2021 in India Category:2020 protests",
