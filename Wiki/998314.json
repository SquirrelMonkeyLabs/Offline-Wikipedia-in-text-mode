 "text": "William De Witt Snodgrass (January 5, 1926 – January 13, 2009) was an American poet. Snodgrass was born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1926. During World War II he was in the United States Navy in the Pacific area. After the war, he was a student for seven years at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. Then he taught at Cornell University, Wayne State, Syracuse University, and the University of Delaware. His first book of poetry, Heart's Needle, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1960. From 1977, starting with The Fuherer Bunker, he worked on a group of poems that were written in the voices of important people in the Nazi period. This was a problem for some readers. But it was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry. ==Books== * Heart's Needle (1959) * After Experience: Poems and Translations (1968) * Leaving the Motel (1968) * Remains (1970) * In Radical Pursuit: Critical Essays and Lectures (1975) * The Führer Bunker: A Cycle of Poems in Progress (1977) * If Birds Build with Your Hair (1979) * These Trees Stand (1981) * Heinrich Himmler (1982) * The Boy Made of Meat (1983) * Magda Goebbels (1983) * D.
