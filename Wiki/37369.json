It quickly rose to No. 1 in the Billboard Top 200 Chart. An extremely successful album for the band, they went on to tour for the next few years. === The Hunting Party (2014-2017) === In 2014, the band once again decided to change their style for the new album. Mike Shinoda stated that he wished to create a more traditional Rock sound after listening to the radio one day. The band decided to make the music that they wanted to hear. The album was explosive, loud and possibly the heaviest they had been yet. They decided not to have Rick Rubin produce this album, for the first time in 3 consecutive albums. It features guest appearances by Page Hamilton of the band Helmet, rapper Rakim, Daron Malakian of the band System of a Down, and Tom Morello of the band Rage Against the Machine. The album produced five singles; \"Guilty All the Same\", \"Until It's Gone\", \"Wastelands\", \"Rebellion\", and \"Final Masquerade\". It was well received by critics and fans alike, and reached No. 3 on Billboard 200. === One More Light and Chester Bennington's death (2015—2017) === In early 2017, the band released the new single from their latest album, called \"Heavy\", featuring new artist Kiiara. Fans immediately reacted with polarised responses. Some loved the new direction taken by the band, which can be described as \"Poppy\", whereas others disliked it, calling Linkin Park \"Sellouts\". The Official Lyrics video got some of the highest dislikes of any Linkin Park video on YouTube. Frustrated with the response from fans, Chester Bennington became angry on several occasions, though publicly apologized later on, saying that he understands the fans' perspective, is grateful to all of their fans, and that he should rethink his own perspective. Despite the polarizing response from critics and fans alike, the album became extremely successful. Like before, it reached No. 1 on Billboard 200, and was certified gold in several countries. The album features Kiiara, Pusha T, and Stormzy as special guest artists. After touring The Hunting Party, the band decided to write songs with outside help. They teamed up with several big names in the music industry, with a focus on writing lyrics before music, something they had not really experimented with before. They said that they wanted to attempt to do away with any notion of genre. When strangely ridiculed about the lack of guitar and drums on the album, based purely on their first release of \"Heavy\", Brad Delson responded by saying that actually, there is a lot of guitar in the album. He then went on to list the songs \"Sharp Edges\", \"Invisible\" and \"Sorry For Now\" as having lots of layers of different guitars each. The album produced several singles; \"Heavy\", \"Talking to Myself\" and \"One More Light\", the song for which the album is named. This is the first time that Linkin Park have named an album after a song. Mike Shinoda described the album as \"risky\". The band had been following a traditionally rock oriented sound, and this marked a big change from that style. Instead of focusing on anger, betrayal or other negative emotions, as they had been known for in the past, many of the songs focus on family, friends, and emotions. For instance, the songs \"Invisible\" and \"Sorry For Now\" both focus on the band member's children, and the title song \"One More Light\" is about remembering, and caring about someone after they have died. Chester Bennington's close friend and musician Chris Cornell committed suicide by hanging. When Chester heard the news, it made him extremely upset, as the pair had known each other for years. Cornell had performed on stage with Bennington in the past, and was even the godfather of some of his children. The loss of his friend affected him and the band so much that they decided to perform the song \"One More Light\" in his memory at the Jimmy Kimmel Live! Show in Los Angeles, rather than perform a more commercially viable song from the album. It was a fitting song for them at that time because of its themes of dealing with the loss of a friend or loved one. After his death, Bennington said \"I can't imagine a world without you in it\" about Cornell. Chester began to talk more openly about some of his struggles. He had previously revealed that he was a victim of child abuse and rape, but also talked about his mental issues, as well as his battles with drugs and alcohol. He described his depression and anxiety in several talk shows, and stated that he sometimes feels very upset with himself. At Cornell's funeral, Chester sang Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\". Midway through the One More Light Tour, On July 20th 2017, Linkin Park released a music video for \"Talking to Myself\" on YouTube. They were unaware that the same morning, Chester Bennington had died in his home in Los Angeles at the age of 41. News reports surfaced across the internet, and fans began to panic. On Twitter, Mike Shinoda posted: > \"Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out > as soon as we have one\". His death was ruled as a suicide by hanging. A half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were found. His housekeeper discovered his body around 9:00 a.m. PDT. The band, friends, family and fans all paid tribute to Chester. A trending Twitter hashtag surfaced, \"#RIPChester\", which was used several million times, and simply listening to Linkin Park songs, fans managed to populate, and even completely fill charts with many classic Linkin Park songs, even some from Meteora and Hybrid Theory, which at the time were over 13 years old. Remembrance events were held by fans, who attended in their thousands, paying tribute to the late artist by singing songs, lighting candles and creating memorials to Chester. His funeral was held on July 29th, at South Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes, California. Many musical tributes were held in his memory, and he was buried there. On September 18th 2017, Linkin Park released the music video for the song \"One More Light\", dedicated to Chester. The song has gained nearly 1 million likes on YouTube, and has had 27 million views. === Reformation and new singer (2024—present) === On a September 5, 2024 livestream, the band announced that they would be reforming and that Emily Armstrong would be their new singer. There was some controversy over this because of Armstrong's support of Danny Masterson during his sexual assault trial and her association with the Church of Scientology. Armstrong would later state that she condemned Masterson's actions and had not been in contact with his since the trial. During their livestream, the band also played their new song \"The Emptiness Machine\" and announced their next album From Zero, as well as a six-continent; six date tour. == Members == === Current members === * Mike Shinoda - Vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, piano (1996-Now) * Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell - Bass guitar, Vocals, samples (1996-1999, then 2001-Now) * Brad Delson - Lead guitar, Vocals (1996-Now) * Emily Armstrong – lead vocals (2023–Now) * Colin Brittain – drums, percussion (2023–Now) * Joe Hahn \"Mr. Hahn\" - Turntable, samples, programming, keyboards, backing vocals (1996-Now) === Former members === * Mark Wakefield - singing (1996-1998) * Kyle Christener - bass (1998-1999) * Ian Hornbeck – bass (2000) * Scott Koziol - bass (1999-2001) * Chester Bennington - Vocals, rhythm guitar (1999-2017; his death) * Rob Bourdon - Drums, percussion (1996-2017) == Albums == === Studio albums === * Hybrid Theory (2000) * Meteora (2003) * Minutes to Midnight (2007) * A Thousand Suns (2010) * Living Things (2012) * The Hunting Party (2014) * One More Light (2017) * From Zero (2024) === Other albums === * Xero, a demo tape (1996) * Hybrid Theory EP (1998/2001 re-release) * Reanimation (2002) * Live In Texas (2003) * Collision Course (2004) (with Jay-Z) * \"iTunes Live from SoHo\" (2008) * Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes (2008) * Songs from the Underground (2008) * \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – The Score\" (2009) (with Steve Jablonsky) * \"8-Bit Rebellion!\" (2010) * \"A Decade Underground\" (2010) * \"Underground X: Demos\" (2010) * \"A Thousand Suns+\" (2011) * \"Studio Collection 2000–2012\" (2013) * \"Living Things +\" (2013) * \"Recharged\" (2013) * \"A Light That Never Comes (Remixes)\" (2014) (with Steve Aoki) * Lost Demos Released: November 24, 2023 * Papercuts Released: April 12, 2024 == References == == Other websites == * Linkin Park web site * Linkin Park web site on MySpace * Minutes to Midnight album website Category:1996 establishments in California Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American heavy metal bands Category:Musical groups established in 1996 Category:Musical groups from California Category:Nu metal bands Category:Warner Bros.
