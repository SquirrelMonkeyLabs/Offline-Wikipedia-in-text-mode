 "text": "Team Trees is a non-profit fundraiser trying to plant 20 million trees by 2020. It was created by the YouTubers MrBeast and Mark Rober, and many other YouTubers have helped too. The donations go to the Arbor Day Foundation, a group that plants one tree for every $1 received. Mark Rober himself has made a self tree planting drone. Recently, they have both also made a separate charity called Team Seas with a similiar goal. == Related pages == * Team Seas ==References== == Other websites == *Official website Category:Charity events Category:MrBeast",
