 "text": "A music school or conservatoire teaches music in all its aspects. It may be called a college of music, or academy of music or conservatory (American English) or a conservatorium (Australian English). Music schools exist at different levels: The term conservatory is often used for specialized university-grade schools that train people who want a career as a music artist, dance or theatre performer. The students learn how to play musical instruments, singing, composition, musicology, music history and music theory. Several high schools also offer an education in music. In these high schools, the subjects are integrated into a normal school curriculum. The third type of music school is independent of the other education a child or adults gets. These schools are often organised as associations, or they are run by a theatre. Pupils can learn music and other performing arts outside a context of regular schooling.
