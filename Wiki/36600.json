The Qin emperor ordered a new city to be constructed, called Jiang (江州) and Chu Prefecture (楚州). In 581 AD (Sui Dynasty), Chongqing was renamed to Yu Prefecture (渝州). In 1102 the city was renamed Gong Prefecture. In 1189 renamed Yu Prefecture to Chongqing Subprefecture. In 1362 (Yuan Dynasty), Ming Yuzhen, a peasant rebel leader, established Daxia Kingdom at Chongqing for a short time. In 1621, another short-lived kingdom of Daliang was established there. In 1891, Chongqing became the first inland commerce port open to foreigners. Since 1929, Chongqing was a municipality of the Republic of China.
