 "text": "Yucca moths are a family of moths (Lepidopera). There are about 80 species, in two subfamilies. Many of them are specific to one or a few species of agave- like plants. The moths live inside the plants. They are an example of co- evolution: many moths evolved with the specific host plant. The host plants sometimes adapted that they need specific moths for pollination. Category:Moths",
