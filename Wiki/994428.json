 "text": "The New York School is a name given to a group of American poets, painters, dancers, and musicians who were active in the 1950s and 1960s in New York City. The group was made of personal and professional relationships, usually friendship, between individuals. Poets (like Frank O'Hara), painters (like Willem de Kooning), musicians (like John Cage), and many others got to know each other and shared their ideas about making art. In poetry, what is called \"the first generation\" included Frank Oâ€™Hara, John Ashbery, James Schulyer, Kenneth Koch, and Barbara Guest. O'Hara and Schuyler both worked at the Museum of Modern Art. Common meeting places for poets and painters were bars like the Cedar Tavern. A \"second generation\" of poets had writers like Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, Ron Padgett, and Anne Waldman. ==References== Category:American poets Category:American painters Category:American dancers Category:Organizations based in New York City Category:American musical groups",
