 "text": "Scoring in the sport of cricket is done by the batting team, and achieved by accumulation of runs and extras. The term is also used for the process of recording scores and dismissals on a ball-by-ball basis. The recorders are known as scorers. ==Runs== NB: Section under construction as it needs to be rewritten. Scoring runs is the subject of Law 18 in The Laws of Cricket. ==Extras== The batting team can increase its total score with the addition of extras. These include penalties imposed on the bowlers for no balls and wides. Other extras are gained from byes and leg byes. ==Results== In a first-class match, the winning team is the one which has scored the most runs, providing the second innings of their opponents has been completed. Other possible results are a draw and a tie. In certain matches, especially championship finals, a draw or tie can be a first innings victory, the match being awarded to the team with the higher first innings total. == References == Category:Cricket Category:Sports words",
