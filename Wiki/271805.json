 "text": "A relic is an object, especially a piece of the body or a personal item of someone of religious importance, that was carefully preserved with an air of veneration as a memorial that you can touch. Relics are an important aspect of Buddhism, some denominations of Christianity, Hinduism, shamanism, and many other personal belief systems. The word relic comes from the Latin reliquiae ('remains'). A reliquary is a shrine that houses one or more relics. Some well-known religious relics include the Tooth of Buddha, the Holy Grail, the Crown of Thorns, the True Cross of Jesus, the Staff of Moses. == Other websites == *Relics article from the Catholic Encyclopedia *Relics *Keeping Relics in Perspective *A Place for Relics *The veneration of the relics of saints - from the Summa Theologiae *An Inventory of Relics by John Calvin Category:Religious objects",
