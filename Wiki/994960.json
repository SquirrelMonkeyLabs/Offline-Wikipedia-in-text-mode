 "text": "Bizarro is a supervillain/anti-hero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Otto Binder and artist George Papp as a \"mirror image\" of Superman, and first appeared in Superboy #68 (1958). Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books (1956 – c. 1970), the character has often been portrayed as an antagonist to Superman, though on occasion he also takes on an anti-hero role. == Publication history == Bizarro was created by writer Otto Binder and artist George Papp, and first appeared in Superboy #68 (1958). He debuted in the Silver Age of Comic Books (1956 – c. 1970), == Fictional character biography == He was created as a result of a flawed cloning process, which resulted in a being that mirrored Superman's powers but had a distorted, opposite personality and appearance. Bizarro's skin is typically depicted as pale or gray, and he often has a blocky, awkward demeanor, contrasting with Superman's heroic and graceful nature. == Powers and abilities == Originally, this Bizarro's abilities were the same as Superman's, but in homage to his Pre-Crisis counterpart, this Bizarro also developed reversed powers as well as adding things like \"x-ray hearing\" and \"spotlight vision.\" Instead of possessing heat vision and freeze breath like Superman, he has freeze vision and flame breath, the latter recently shown in Batman/Superman #22 (Loeb, McCGuinness, Vines) He has also been discovered to be physically more powerful than Superman, but the nature of his fractured mind leaves him unable to access that potential. == In other media == In addition to appearing the company's publications, he has also appeared in adapted media and tie-in products, such as animated and live- action television series, trading cards, toys, and video games.
