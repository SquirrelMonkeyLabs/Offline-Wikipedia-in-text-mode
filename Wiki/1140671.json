 "text": "The Place Anneessens (French) or Anneessensplein (Dutch) is a square in central Brussels, Belgium. It is named after François Anneessens, a local leader, who was killed on the Grote Markt (Brussels' main square) during a rebellion in the Austrian Netherlands.https://monument.heritage.brussels/files/cities/1000/documents/01-vol- a-fr-def_k.pdf ==Location== The square is on the Boulevard Maurice Lemonnier (Maurice Lemonnierlaan), in the Midi–Lemonnier or Stalingrad district, which is the southern part of the City of Brussels. It is served by the premetro (underground tram) station Anneessens on lines 3 and 4. ==History== The square, with seven other streets, was created in 1639 on the Voldersbempt or Pré aux Foulons, a quiet field near the Rue d'Anderlecht (Anderlechtstraat), the river Senne, and a small part of the river called the \"Lesser Senne\" (French: Petite Senne, Dutch: Kleine Zenne). Before the Senne was covered over (1867–1871), the square had a famous flea market called the Old Market (French: Vieux Marché, Dutch: Oude Markt). Due to a richer crowd and complaints from local people after the Central Boulevards were built, in March 1873, the city decided to move the Old Market to the Place du Jeu de Balle (Vossenplein) in the Marolles (Marollen) district, a role that square still has today. ==References== ==Other websites== * Media related to Place Anneessens at Wikimedia Commons Category:Brussels Category:Town squares in Europe",
