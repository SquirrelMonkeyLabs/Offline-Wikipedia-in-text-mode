 "text": "Quark-star is hypothetical celestial object that is intermediate in density between a neutron star and black hole, as the remnant of a massive neutron star that has collapsed with gravitational pressure sufficient to reduce all constituent particles to strange quarks. Quark-stars can be smaller than 11 kilometers in diameter. Like neutron stars, quark star are composed of neutrons that have undergone enough pressure by the collapse of the star to have lost their differentiation and disolved into a mass of quarks and gluons. The up and down quarks of which neutrons are composed that change into strange quarks, with the resulting strange mattery compacting into an even denser mass than a neutron star. == Related pages == * Supermassive black hole, is a extremetly black hole and massive, most likely is existed in every galactic centre. * Quasar, a active Galactic centre that is maybe contain the supermassive black hole * Intergalactic star, is a star that is not in any galaxy. * Quasi-star, a hypothetically star that is form from massive neutron star. == References == Category:Stars",
