 "text": "Rhino (Aleksei Sytsevich) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a supporting antagonist in Spider-Man comic book series and a minor antagonist in the Marvel Universe. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr., and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #41 (Oct. 1966). == Fictional character biography == He is a Russian immigrant who had radioactive testing. This gave him powerful superhuman strength and durability. He was given a suit of tough, rhinoceros-like armor and horns for even more destructive capabilities. He is mostly on Spider-Man's rogues gallery, but sometimes clashes with Hulk too. == In other media == The Rhino has been adapted to various forms of media since his debut in the Silver Age of Comic Books, including animated television series and video games. He has featured in Marvel action figures and trading cards. American actor Paul Giamatti played a version of Aleksei Sytsevich who uses a rhinoceros-themed battle armor, similar to the character's Ultimate Marvel incarnation, in the 2014 movie The Amazing Spider-Man 2. He is played by Alessandro Nivola in the 2024 movie Kraven the Hunter, set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe.
