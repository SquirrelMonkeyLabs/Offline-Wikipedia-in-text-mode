 "text": "In algebra, a Quadratic function is a function that contains an expression where its degree (the highest exponent it has) is 2, which means that it is quadratic (See etymology). Its single-variable standard form isː f(x)=ax^2+bx+c Where a, b and c are all constants and a ≠ 0. When such a function gets plotted on a graph where f(x)=y, a curve that extends infinitely called a parabola will appear. When a quadratic function is set equal to zero, then it turns into a quadratic equation. The answers to the equation are where the function crosses the x-axis. == Etymology == The word quadratic comes from the Latin word quadrātum (\"square\"). This is because of the presence of a number (which isx^2 in the standard form) that is the result of squaring its square root (x\\times x=x^2). Category:Algebra",
