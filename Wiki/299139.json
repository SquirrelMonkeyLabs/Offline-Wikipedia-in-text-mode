 "text": "Georg Holtzendorff was a 19th-century German landscape painter from Saxony. He moved to England because of the Franco-Prussian War. Holtzendorff worked for the Royal Crown Derby Porcelain Company. He sketched the landscape of Derbyshire and these were used as designs for porcelain. His main work was the decoration of the Gladstone Dessert Service, presented by the Liberal Working Men of Derby to Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1883. Watercolour by Holtzendorff, with a view of Becket Street, Derby, with the Derby Museum and Art Gallery in the background, is the only remaining study on paper linked to the Gladstone service. == References == Category:19th-century births Category:19th-century deaths Category:German painters",
