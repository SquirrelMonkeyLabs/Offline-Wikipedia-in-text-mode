Douglas Sirk's finest directorial effort ... one of the most notable critiques of the American family ever made.\"TV Guide review Roger Ebert writes, \"a perverse and wickedly funny melodrama in which you can find the seeds of Dallas, Dynasty, and all the other prime-time soaps. Sirk is the one who established their tone, in which shocking behavior is treated with passionate solemnity, while parody burbles beneath ... To appreciate a film like Written on the Wind probably takes more sophistication than to understand one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces, because Bergman's themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk the style conceals the message. His interiors are wildly over the top, and his exteriors are phony - he wants you to notice the artifice, to see that he's not using realism but an exaggerated Hollywood studio style ... Films like this are both above and below middle-brow taste. If you only see the surface, it's trashy soap opera. If you can see the style, the absurdity, the exaggeration and the satirical humor, it's subversive of all the 1950s dramas that handled such material solemnly. William Inge and Tennessee Williams were taken with great seriousness during the decade, but Sirk kids their Freudian hysteria.\" == References == ==Other websites== * * * Criterion Collection essay by Laura Mulvey Category:1956 romantic drama movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:Universal Pictures movies Category:Women's movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies directed by Douglas Sirk Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies about alcoholism Category:Movies about depression Category:Movies about dysfunctional families Category:Movies set in Texas Category:Movies set in Rhode Island",
