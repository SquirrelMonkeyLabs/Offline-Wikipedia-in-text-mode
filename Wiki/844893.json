The movie was shot in Nashville, Tennessee under a budget of $1 million. It was not given a large theatrical release. Because of that,Gummo failed to bring in much money. Reviews on the movie from the critics were mixed. ==Plot== A young boy named Solomon narrates events from the tornado that went through the small town of Xenia, Ohio. A mute adolescent boy, nicknamed Bunny Boy, wears only tennis shoes, shorts and pink bunny ears on an overpass in the rain. A boy named Tummler, who is also a friend for Solomon, carries a cat by its neck. He drowns the cat in a barrel of water. Gummo then cuts into a different scene with Tummler in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle one another. Tummler realizes there is a lump on one of the girl's breast's. Tummler and Solomon then ride down on a hill on bicycles. Later, Tummler points an air rifle at another cat. Solomon stops him from killing the cat and says it was a housecat. The boys leave. The camera then follows the cat to its owners' house. The cat is owned by three sisters, two are teenagers, the third has not gone through puberty yet. The movie later cuts to a scene in which two foul-mouthed boys dressed as cowboys destroy things in a junkyard. Bunny Boy comes. The other boys shoot him \"dead\" using cap guns.
