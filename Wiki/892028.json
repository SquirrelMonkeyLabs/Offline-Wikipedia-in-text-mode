 "text": "The northern tree toad, known as changeable tree toad, chameleon hyla, chameleon tree toad, common tree toad, common tree frog, dusky tree toad, rain toad, eastern common tree frog, gray tree frog, or eastern gray tree frog (Dryophytes versicolor) is a frog that lives in the North America. It lives in the United States and Canada. It lives as far west as Texas, as far east as Virginia and as far north as Ontario. The adult male frog is 3.1 to 5.1 cm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 3.3 to 6.0 cm long. This frog can change color. It does this to make itself harder to see. Scientists call this metachrosis. This frog can be light green, gray-green, brown, or dark brown in color. It takes the frog about half an hour to change from one color to another. There is a white or olive spot under each eye. Some of these frogs have a white spot on their backs. There is orange-yellow color on their legs. The yellow only shows when the frog jumps. Scientists call this \"flash\" color. The female frog lays 30-40 eggs at a time. The tadpoles can breathe by sucking bubbles down from the surface. Older tadpoles jump out of the water to breathe like a whale. This frog climbs very high into the trees to look for food. It spends time high in the tree's canopy. This frog can survive being frozen. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
