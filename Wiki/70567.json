 "text": "Wind power in South Australia is a big energy source for the state and South Australia is well suited to wind farms as it is close to the Roaring forties winds. As of June 2014, South Australia has 16 wind farms, with an installed capacity of 1,473 megawatts (MW). Wind power represented 27% of the state's energy production.Government of South Australia: \"Wind energy in South Australia\" , updated 28 November 2014, retrieved 17 January 2015 Wind farms do not emit greenhouse gases in the generation of electricity, and so wind power is considered a highly desirable form of renewable energy which assists in the reduction of the Stateâ€™s reliance on coal and gas fired electricity generation.Mount Millar Wind Farm (2006).
