 "text": "Kylo Ren (born Ben Solo) is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He was introduced in the 2015 movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He was portrayed by Adam Driver. He is the main villain of The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi , and is redeemed in the final installment The Rise of Skywalker. Kylo Ren is the pseudonym of Ben Solo, the son of original Star Wars trilogy characters Han Solo, who he later killed, and Leia Organa. Though trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker as a Jedi, he has been drawn to the dark side of the Force, and wants to be as powerful as his grandfather, Darth Vader who he praised and thought was the king of evil, not the one who killed the emperor. Throughout all of The Force Awakens and the first two acts of The Last Jedi, Ren wants to be fully committed to the dark side, but there are times where the light side tries to pull him back in. This can be seen because when he kills his father Han, he hesitates before he does it. Even when he has a chance to kill his mother Leia, he chooses not to after giving it thought. This makes him a complex character. Kylo Ren is the master of the Knights of Ren and a commander for the First Order, an organization created from the fallen Galactic Empire.The First Order believed that the Empire's leader, Emperor Palpatine, had been killed by Luke Skywalker, not Darth Vader. He is featured in The Force Awakens media and merchandising, and has appeared in the movie's sequel, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi. ==References== ==Other websites== * Kylo Ren in the Official StarWars.com Encyclopedia Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2015 Category:Star Wars characters Category:Fictional people with personality disorders Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Supervillains",
