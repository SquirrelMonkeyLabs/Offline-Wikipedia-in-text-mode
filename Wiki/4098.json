 "text": "Latvia (Latvian: Latvija), officially the Republic of Latvia (Latvijas Republika), is a country in Northern Europe. The capital is Riga. It is one of the Baltic states, together with Estonia in the north and Lithuania in the south. Latvia's neighbours to the east are the countries Russia and Belarus. Latvia is divided into four parts: Kurzeme, Vidzeme, Zemgale, and Latgale. People from Latvia are called Latvians. They speak the Latvian language, which is a little like the Lithuanian language but is not close enough to be understood. There are other peoples that live in Latvia, including the Germans and the Russians. == History == Latvia was settled by the Baltic tribes thousands of years ago. They mainly fished, hunted, and traded. German traders and crusaders came to Latvia at the end of the 12th century. Latvians lost control of their homeland. Over the next 800 years, Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles, and Russians all invaded Latvia. Latvia finally became independent in 1918. Between the 13th and the 15th centuries, the Teutonic Knights had a state that occupied Latvian territory. Before World War I, the aristocracy was mainly German. During the Great Northern War from 1700 to 1721, what is now Latvia became the part of the Russian Empire and were organized as Courland and Livonia. Latvian workers took part in the revolutionary struggle in 1905. In 1940, Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union. It was briefly under German occupation during World War II in from 1941 to 1944. After the war, many factories were opened. Latvia became one of the more successful Soviet republics. In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed, and Latvia had its independence restored. == Politics == In Copenhagen on 13 December 2002, Latvia and nine other countries were invited to join the European Union. On 20 September 2003, Latvians held an election to vote on joining. Two thirds of Latvians voted to join, and on 1 May 2004, Latvia became a member of the EU. Latvia has been a NATO member since 29 March 2004. There are 43 local government units, set up in 2020. 36 are municipalities (Latvian: novadi) and 7 state cities. Before 2020 there were 110 municipalities and nine republic cities. == International rankings == Rankings Name Year Place Out of # Reference CIA World Factbook – GDP per capita (PPP) 2008 66th 229 CIA World Factbook – life expectancy 2008 120th 223 World Economic Forum – Enabling Trade Index ranking 2008 43rd 118 Yale University / Columbia University – Environmental Performance Index 2008 8th 149 The Economist Intelligence Unit – e-readiness 2008 37th 70 The Economist Intelligence Unit – Global Peace Index 2008 39th 140 United States Patent and Trademark Office's list of patents by country 2007 95th 172 Save the Children – Mother's Index Rank 2007 25th 141 Save the Children – Women's Index Rank 2007 21st 141 Save the Children – Children's Index Rank 2007 33rd 141 Wall Street Journal / The Heritage Foundation – Index of Economic Freedom 2007 39th 157 United Nations – Human Development Index 2008 44th 179 World Economic Forum – Global Competitiveness Report 2007–2008 2007 45th 131 World Economic Forum – The Global Gender Gap Report 2007 2007 13th 128 World Bank – Ease of Doing Business Index 2007–2008 29th 181 Reporters Without Borders – Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007 12th 169 Transparency International – Corruption Perceptions Index 2007 49th 180 The Economist Intelligence Unit – Index of Democracy 2007 43rd 167 Privacy International – Privacy index (EU and 11 other selected countries) 2006 28th 36 New Economics Foundation – Happy Planet Index 2006 160th 178 The Economist Intelligence Unit – Quality-of-life index 2005 66th 111 Save the Children – % seats in the national government held by women 2004 23–25th 126 World Health Organization – suicide rates by country (both sexes) 8th 101 NationMaster's index of civil and political liberties 17th 140 ==Related pages== * Latvia at the Olympics * Latvia national football team * List of rivers of Latvia == References == == Other websites == * Latvian Government official site Category:European Union member states Category:1991 establishments in Europe",
