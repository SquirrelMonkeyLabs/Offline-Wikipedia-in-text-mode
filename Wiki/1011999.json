In 2021, it was estimated that there was 39 owned guns every 100 people, Serbia was ranked third on this statistic, only behind the United States and Yemen. Along with a culture of gun ownership and many houses keeping war trophies, illegal weapons became widespread in certain countries in the Balkans following the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s. Mass shootings are rare in Serbia and the rest of the Balkans. In the 21st century there were previously four mass shootings: the Jabukovac killings in which nine people were killed, the 2013 Velika Ivanča shooting in which 14 people were killed, the 2016 Žitište shooting in which five people were killed and the Belgrade school shooting that happened the day before, in which nine people were killed, leading the government to propose stricter gun laws. == References == Category:Murder in 2023 Category:2023 in Europe Category:2020s mass shootings in Europe Category:21st century in Serbia Category:May 2023 events",
