 "text": "Phyllodytes punctatus is a frog. It lives in Brazil. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Fazenda Gravat√° in Sergipe. People have seen it as high as 140 meters above sea level. The adult frog is about 18.2-22.8 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin on the back is brown, and there are brown spots on the back and legs. This frog has a bump on its nose and three bumps on each eyelid. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place, only 1,044 km2, and this place is being changed by human beings who build towns and cities and make places for animals to eat grass. People also go into the places where the frogs live to take away the bromeliad plants they need, but this only happens in a few places. Real estate speculation, which means when people buy land so that they can sell it for more many later, also threatens this frog. This frog lives in places with white sandy soil and in places with shrubs. This frog lives on bromeliad plants that grow on native plants. Scientists have only seen it in natural places, and not in farms or gardens where humans have changed the places. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
