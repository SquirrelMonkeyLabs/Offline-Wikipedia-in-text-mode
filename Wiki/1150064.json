It was founded in 2014 after the Chinese company Wanxiang Group bought the assets of Fisker Automotive, which went bankrupt. Karma is based in Irvine, California. The company makes cars at a factory in Moreno Valley, California. Karma sells its cars in places like North America, Europe, South America, and the Middle East. ==History== In February 2014, Wanxiang Group, a Chinese company, bought the assets of Fisker Automotive after it went bankrupt. Fiskerâ€™s old factory in Delaware and the designs for its cars were included in the sale, but the Fisker brand itself was not. In 2016, Karma started building a new car called the Revero in its Moreno Valley factory. The company planned to make about 3,000 Revero cars a year. In 2019, Karma opened a Customization Center to create special designs for its cars and also announced a partnership to build electric delivery vehicles. ==Products== ===Revero=== The Karma Revero is a luxury plug-in hybrid. This means it has both an electric motor and a gas engine. The car can travel about 300 miles using both engines, with about 50 miles on electricity alone. It was awarded Luxury Green Car of the Year in 2018. === Revero GT=== The Revero GT is a more powerful version of the Revero. It can go from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 96 km/h) in about 4.5 seconds. The total range is about 360 miles, with 80 miles on electric power alone. Karma plans to make the Revero GT its main car, with plans to add an all-wheel-drive version with over 1,100 horsepower. ===GS Series=== The GS Series includes the first fully-electric car from Karma. It includes the GS-6 and GSe-6 models. GS-6: This is a plug-in hybrid with a range of 330 miles (530 km) when using both electric and gas engines. It has 536 horsepower.
