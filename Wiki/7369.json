 "text": "House music is a type of electronic dance music. It began during the early 1980s from disco and the black American soul music tradition. It takes its name from the Warehouse, a Chicago club where DJs first played their records to a large audience. The original \"House\" sound is characterized by \"four on the floor\" beats at 120-130 BPM, forward-driven bass lines, an emphasis on the second and fourth beats of each measure, handclaps, and cymbals. Over the years, house has created many types of house music. These include: * Acid house (with its \"trippy\" melodic lines, usually generated on a Roland 303 synthesizer) * Ambient house (with an ambient, atmospheric sound) * Bassline house (with an prominent warpy low bass sound) * Deep house (with a greater emphasis on \"soul\" and atmospheric background sounds) * Electro house (with a fuzzy, electronic and dirty bassline and heavy usage of synthesizers, similar to electropop) * Euro house (with a sound similar to Eurodance) * Balearic house (originating in the Balearic islands of Spain) * French house (originating in France) * Italo house (originating in Italy) * Speed garage (featuring choppy basslines, reggae-style vocals and often \"broken\" beats) * Kuduro (a type of house music played in Angola features Angolan music and world music) * Progressive house (usually faster than traditional house, with many volume and phase changes and a \"progression\" of different background sounds) * Disco house (even greater emphasis on the bassline, and the return of many disco-like additions such as violin sections) * Hip house (House music with rapped lyrics) * Tech house (techno sounds featured over a house-derived beat, with melodic progression often less emphasized) * Latin house (incorporating elements of traditional Latin American music) * Tribal house (greater emphasis on drumlines; melodies may be present, but with less traditional \"progression\") * Witch house (with a dark, paranormal and witchcraft-themed sound) and Rodrick Onunuga ==References== Category:Electronic dance music",
