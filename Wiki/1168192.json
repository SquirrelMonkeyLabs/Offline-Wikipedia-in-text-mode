It was officially opened on December 8, 1985. It runs over False Creek, connecting Cambie Street and both Nelson and Smithe Streets in the downtown peninsula. TransLink operates six stations along Cambie Street. They are Olympic Village, Broadway–City Hall, King Edward, Oakridge–41st Avenue, Langara–49th Avenue, and Marine Drive. They are all for the SkyTrain's Canada Line. The construction of the Canada Line was controversial. It greatly affected both businesses and traffic along Cambie Street. Residents wanted a rail in the tunnel for the train but the winning bidder decided to use a cut-and-cover type of tunnel instead. This cost less money but much of the street was shut down which angered shopkeepers.Help Save Cambie Boulevard, and so much more, Vancouver Courier, February 22, 2004, p. 21 A lawsuit was brought to the Supreme Court of British Columbia by a shop owner named Susan Heyes for profit loss. She won and was awarded $600,000 but the verdict was later reversed on appeal.
