After his death, he was enshrined as the main and only deity in Tainan-Jinja, Taiwan, with the name Kitashirakawa no Miya Yoshihisa- shinnō no Mikoto. == Biography == === Early life === Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa was born as the ninth son of Prince Fushimi Kuniie (1802–1875) and Horiuchi Nobuko. He later became a Buddhist priest with the title Rinnoji-no- miya and served as the abbot of Kan'ei-ji in Edo. === Bakumatsu period === During the Boshin War, Prince Yoshihisa fled north with Tokugawa supporters after the Satsuma-Chōshū takeover of Edo. He became the nominal head of the \"Northern Alliance\" consisting of most of the domains of northern Japan, led by Date Yoshikuni of Sendai. Some documents refer to Prince Yoshihisa as \"'Emperor Tōbu\"' and describe the planned era names for his reign, but historians disagree on whether or not he was actually named emperor. His era name was believed to have been either Taisei or Enju depending on the source. After the Meiji Restoration, in 1873, Emperor Meiji ordered all imperial princes serving as Buddhist priests to return to their secular status. Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, at that time serving as a priest under the title Rinnoji-no-miya, was also recalled to secular life. Later that year, he succeeded his younger brother, Prince Kitashirakawa Kasunari, as the second head of the new princely house of Kitashirakawa-no-miya. === Marriage and family === The couple had one son, Prince Morimasa (護正宮, Morimasa-no-miya, 25 September 1887 – 18 May 1949). * Prince Kitashirakawa Naruhisa (18 April 1887 – 2 April 1923)Takenobu, Yoshitaro.
