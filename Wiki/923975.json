Her childhood was filled with racism and shaped her ideas for the future.Ras, A., & Sellassle-Turner, E. (1997, May 09). Queen mother moore,activist, dies at 98: She dedicated her life to liberation of black family. Philadelphia Tribune (1912-). ProQuest. Retrieved 2022-04-20. In the 1920s, she was involved in Marcus Garvey’s UNIA, which fought for the creation of organizations by and for the Black community. In 1933, she turned to the Communist party because they were the only ones focused on her rights. With them, she deepened her studies of race, class, gender, and reparations (giving back to victims of slavery and their descendants). She publicly spoke against the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy and was in favor of the Scottsboro Boys. She left the party in 1950 and became a republican, then a democrat. For most of the 1950s and 1960s, Moore was the most known leader for African-American reparations. She was a “shero” (heroine) in Harlem and a role model. She went on to create the Universal Association of Ethiopian Women and the in the 1960s, which was a diverse community organization fighting for reparations, and strengthened other organizations along the way. The efforts of UAEW members caused the state of Louisiana to rethink the idea of reparations. In 1963, in honor of the 100-year anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, the group helped Black Americans file formal reparations claims (asking for something to make up for an unfair act) to the US government. On a trip to Africa in 1972, the Ashanti people in Ghana gave her the honorary title of “Queen Mother”.Thousands pay final respects to audrey 'queen mother' moore. (1997, May 21).
