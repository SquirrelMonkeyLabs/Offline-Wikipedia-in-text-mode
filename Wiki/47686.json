 "text": "Cannibal Corpse is an American death metal band. The band was formed in Buffalo, New York in 1988 by Bob Rusay, the first guitarist (who left the band in 1993). The band's lyrics draw heavily on horror fiction themes. Some of their songs are about murder, raping people, having sex with dead bodies, and eating people. The band's early releases are highly controversial within the media. The bands' first 3 albums were banned in Europe until 2006 because of their bloody artwork. The band's music is very fast, dark, and angry. Some of the band's later songs have been said to be quite difficult to play.Cannibal Corpse -- Centuries of Torment: The First 20 Years They are considered by many to be one of the most well-known and important death metal bands ever.
