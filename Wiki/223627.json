 "text": "The United National Independence Party (UNIP) is a political party in Zambia. It governed the country from 1964 to 1991. This was under President Kenneth Kaunda. It was the only party allowed to exist in Zambia between 1973 and 1991. The party was founded in October 1959 after the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC) was banned. It was first led by Mainza Chona, because Kaunda, who was leader of the ZANC, had been imprisoned. Kaunda became the party's leader when he was released in January 1960.Zambia : History The Commonwealth ==References== Category:1959 establishments in Africa Category:20th-century establishments in Zambia Category:Political parties in Zambia",
