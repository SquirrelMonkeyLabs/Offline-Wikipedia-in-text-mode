 "text": "The mottled leaf frog (Phasmahyla exilis) is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 200 and 900 meters above sea level. This frog can change color to hide from animals that want to eat it. It can do this by changing its red and orange spots. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that are growing back but cannot live in places that are not forests. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over streams. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the stream below. Scientists do not believe this frog is in danger of dying out because the place where it lives is not in danger even though, there are some tree farms and people take some wood to use. Scientists think this frog can make useful chemicals in its skin. But they do not think anyone catches this frog to take the chemicals. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
