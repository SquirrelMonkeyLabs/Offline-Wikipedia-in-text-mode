 "text": "OMG Tour was a concert tour. It was the third one by American recording artist Usher. The tour, which visited North America, Asia, Europe and Australia, accompanies his sixth studio album, Raymond v. Raymond (2010), as well as his first extended play, Versus (2010). In late 2011, the tour was ranked seventh on Billboard's annual, \"Top 25 Tours\", earning nearly $75 million from 73 shows. ==Background== In the summer of 2010, Usher competed in a dance battle against fellow R&B; artist Chris Brown at the Reggae Sumfest. The battle sparked an Internet buzz about the two possibly going on tour. This was further pushed by producer Jermaine Dupri alluding that the two artists may not be aware of this upcoming tour. The singers later took to Twitter to ask who the fans would like to see them perform with. On September 8, 2010, the singer announced his tour trip (and revealed that he was going solo) across North America. Due to demand many additional stops were added in Europe and Australasia. It is Usher's first arena tour since The Truth Tour in 2004. Introducing the tour, Usher said, > \"Live performance has always been my thing. It's my purpose to master and > capture the moment every time I have you connected. For me, I wanted to make > sure that it was state of the art. I wanted to make sure that, in comparison > to the other shows that are going on around the world, you get the type of > experience that leave you saying, 'OMG.' [...] The look of the tour, it's a > little futuristic but enough to capture your attention and leave you saying, > 'OMG.' That's the whole point. With an incredible record, I wanted to also > leave a great impression. ==References== Category:2010 establishments in the United States Category:2011 disestablishments in the United States",
