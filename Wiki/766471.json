 "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Bhutan on 6 March 2020. On 6 March 2020, Bhutan confirmed its first COVID-19 case, a 76-year-old US male who travelled to the country through India. Around 90 people who came directly in contact with him, along with his 59-year-old partner, driver, and guide were quarantined. Farmers reported large increases in sales, as Bhutanese buy local produce, due to facing import hurdles. All schools were closed countrywide, leaving almost 190,000 students to attend classes online. Printed study material were given to students that do not have access to the internet, in addition to radio broadcasts. Bhutan Airlines suspended all flights, leaving only Druk Air to provide air transport to and from Bhutan. As of March 23, only one tourist was still remaining in the country. ==References== Category:Bhutan Bhutan",
