 "text": "Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (), commonly known as Suetonius ( ; c. AD 69 - after AD 122), was a Roman historian. His most important work is called De Vita Caesarum, or Lives of the Caesars. It includes the biographies of twelve successive Roman rulers, from Julius Caesar to Domitian. Suetonius was born when Vespasian was emperor, so scholars say he must have been born before 79 c.e. His father was from Rome's equestrian social class. He worked as a secretary for Emperor Hadrian but he was accused of something having to do with the empress Sabina and was forced to retire in 121 c.e. He wrote De Vita Caesarum after that. Westerners during the medieval and early modern periods thought De Vita Caesarum was a very good book. Many scholars have read and translated it. It has been printed in more than 100 separate versions since 1500 a.d. ==References== Category:Ancient Roman historians Category:Biographers Category:60s births Category:120s deaths",
