 "text": "The Conservative Party of New York State is a political party founded in 1962. The Party was founded due to conservatives not liking the Republican Party in New York. Since 2010, the Conservative Party has held \"Row C\" on New York ballotsâ€”the third-place ballot position, directly below the Democratic and Republican parties because it received the third-highest number of votes of any political party in the 2010, 2014, and 2018 gubernatorial elections. ==References== Category:Political parties in the United States Category:Politics of New York (state)",
