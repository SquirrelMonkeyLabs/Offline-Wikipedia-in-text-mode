 "text": "Anarcha-feminism or anarcho-feminism is an anti-authoritarian, anti- capitalist, anti-oppressive worldview that aims to create a \"level playing field\" for all genders. Anarcha-feminism advocates for women's social freedom and liberty without relying on other groups or parties, obviously, any form goverment. “Anti-patriarchy is not a female issue. We are not the only ones who suffer under the thumb of enforced sex roles, division of labor, emasculation of violence, etc. On the contrary, the devaluation of the feminine archetype could be considered a parallel to the mind/body split that enabled so much of humanity to take a drastic turn in evolution toward domestication and civilization. This “totality” affects men and women in different ways, but they could not be compared in terms of quantity.” Quoted from: The Revolt of Adam & Eve: A Green Anarcha-Feminist Perspective. ==References== Category:Feminism Category:Anarchism",
