Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 18. == History == In the past, North Maluku was a significant area with Islamic sultanates. When Europeans arrived in the 16th century, there was competition between the Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch for control. Eventually, the Dutch took over and ruled for three centuries. During World War II, the Japanese occupied the region. After Indonesia became independent, North Maluku became part of the Maluku province. The official establishment of the North Maluku province was in 1999, separating from Maluku. Ternate was its capital until 2010, when it moved to Sofifi. The economy mainly depends on agriculture, fisheries, and marine products like copra, nutmeg, cloves, and gold. Agricultural products include rice, corn, sweet potatoes, beans, coconut, and more. == Demographics == In 2020, North Maluku had about 1.3 million people, and it's estimated to have grown a bit more in 2022. The largest population is in South Halmahera Regency, with over 248,000 people, followed by Ternate city with around 205,000.
