 "text": "Hypnospace Outlaw is a 2019 simulation video game developed by Tendershoot and published by No More Robots. Set in an alternate history 1999, the game takes place inside a parody of the early Internet and its culture that users visit in their sleep called Hypnospace. The player takes on the role of an \"Enforcer\" for the in-game company Merchantsoft, creator of Hypnospace. They act as a moderator, removing illegal content, copyright violations, viruses, and cyberbullying by users on the service. In the process, the player engages in detective work and puzzle-solving. It was released for Windows, macOS, and Linux in March 2019. It was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in August 2020. == Gameplay == Hypnospace Outlaw uses an interface based on that of a user interface for a operating system and a fake in-game web browser called Hypnospace Explorer. The mission is to discover and report rule-breaking content assigned to the player by Hypnospace staff. Investigation of cases requires exploration of web pages and searching, aided by hints given by the content of the pages. HypnoCoin, the game's main currency, is earned by reporting and closing assigned cases. This currency is exchanged for downloadable programs, virtual pets, wallpapers, themes, and content that advance the story. It also parodies popular bands during 1999, with many webpages music coming from in-game bands such as \"Seepage\", \"Fre3zer\", and the \"Chowder Man\". == Updates and Mods == The game was updated to add more webpages and music. They also added mod support. == References == Category:2019 video games Category:Detective video games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Parodies Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about dreams Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
