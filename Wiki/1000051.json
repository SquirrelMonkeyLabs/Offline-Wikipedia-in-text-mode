 "text": "A table of contents, or Contents, is a list near the beginning of a book. It shows the parts of the book, from its beginning to its end. These parts can include an introduction or preface, chapter titles, notes, list of figures or illustrations, acknowledgments, an appendix, and an index. After each part, a page number is given. This shows where that part begins. A line of dots sometimes goes from the part's name to the page number. ==References== Category:Book terminology",
