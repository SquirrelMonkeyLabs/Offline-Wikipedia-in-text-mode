Before that it was part of the +7 international country code. The local numbering plan came from USSR. It has changed little. Geographic area codes were made based on previous 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that.
