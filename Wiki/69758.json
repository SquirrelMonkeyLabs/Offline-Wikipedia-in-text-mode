 "text": "U.S. Route 1 (sometimes called US 1) is a major United States highway (U.S. Route) in the eastern part of the United States. Its northern end is at the Canadian border in Fort Kent, Maine and its southern end is at Key West, Florida. For most of its route, U.S. Route 1 runs next to Interstate 95. It connects many major cities in the Eastern United States, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, Richmond, Virginia, Raleigh, North Carolina, Augusta, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida, and Miami. Parts of the road were built in the 1800s as the Boston Post Road and in the 1900s as the Atlantic Highway. Despite this, it is significantly further inland from Jacksonville to Petersburg, VA and in North Carolina and Virginia even parallels I-85. ==References== 01",
