There were 40 working mills, but only one is left in 2023. There was a coal mine, known as Hyde Colliery, in the town and in January 1889 an explosion there killed 23 miners. The Peak Forest Canal goes through Hyde from Ashton-under-Lyne to Woodley, Romiley and Marple. There are six railway stations in the town. The Moors murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley lived on the Hattersley estate in Hyde. Harold Shipman was a doctor in the town and most of the people he killed lived there. == References == Category:Towns in Greater Manchester Category:Tameside",
