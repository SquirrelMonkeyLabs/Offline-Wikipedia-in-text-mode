 "text": "Garage Metal is a Rock music fusion genre combining the influences of Garage rock, Metal music, and often other Hard rock genres, that took shape in the Indie (music) underground during the 2020s. Bands draw heavily from 1980s Arena rock, 1970s Punk rock, 2000s Metalcore, and often incorporate numerous other styles into their approach, such as 1980s pop sensibility, Blues structure, Jazz theory, and Progressive rock guitar stylings. The style is characterized by memorable melodies played on Electric guitars, often processed thru various effects pedals, and often accompanied by high energy danceable drum rhythms.
