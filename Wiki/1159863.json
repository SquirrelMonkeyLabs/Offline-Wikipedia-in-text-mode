D'Oultremont was the mayor of Houthalen-Helchteren from 2001 to 2003 and was succeeded by party member Alain Yzermans. In 2003 D'Oultremont succeeded Guy Vrijs as deputy. At the 2005 elections D'Oultremont received a large number of votes. He wanted to become the chairman of the Openbaar Centrum voor Maatschappelijk Welzijn, but he was not given any mandate by his party. Alain Yzermans accused D'Oultremont that he had \"violated political rules\". It turned into a fight between the two. D'Oultremont felt that he was \"politically murdered\" and wrote and published because of that his own obit. In December 2008 it was announced he started the new political party Sociaal & Democratisch, together with Olga Van de Vloed. D'Oultremont died in Genk on 3 January 2025, at the age of 77.De heer Jules d’Oultremont ==References== ==Other websites== * Collection of newspaper articles of D'Oultremont, at ouderenhart.be Category:Belgian politicians Category:Belgian mayors Category:1947 births Category:2025 deaths Category:People from Limburg (Belgium)",
