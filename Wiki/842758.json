 "text": "The Committee for the Preservation of the White House is an advisory committee in charge with the preservation of the White House, the official home and principal workplace of the President of the United States. The Committee for the Preservation of the White House was created by Executive Order in 1964 by President Lyndon Johnson to replace a temporary White House Furnishings Committee created by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy during the Kennedy White House restoration (1961â€“1963). The Executive Order states that the Curator of the White House, Chief Usher of the White House, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chair of the United States Commission of Fine Arts, and Director of the National Gallery of Art are Ex-Officio members of the committee. The Director of the National Park Service is Chair of the Committee, and the First Lady is the Honorary Chair of the committee. In February 2010, Los Angeles interior designer Michael S. Smith was appointed to the committee; in August of that year, his makeover of the Oval Office was revealed to the public. ==References== Category:1964 establishments in the United States",
