 "text": "Fingering is the act of touching the vulva (usually the clitoris) or the vagina and sometimes the anus for the purpose of sexual stimulation with the fingers. It is a common form of foreplay or mutual masturbation. To \"finger oneself\" is to masturbate in this way. Digital penetration is penetration (for example sexual penetration) with one or more fingers. ==Vaginal fingering== Vaginal fingering can end in orgasm. It also may or may not include the entire sexual encounter. It may be part of foreplay or part of a start to other sexual activities. These activities can provide sexual pleasure to a partner when penetrative intercourse is not possible or desirable for whatever reason. Fingering the vagina is often performed to stimulate an area termed the G-spot. The G-spot is reportedly located roughly five centimeters up on the anterior wall of the vagina, forwards toward the navel. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Some women have cited the \"come hither\" approach as a significant catalyst to orgasm. This technique involves the middle finger, sometimes additionally the index or ring finger, making a hand gesture like \"come here\" with the palm facing upwards towards her pubic bone. ==Anal fingering== Fingering of the anus and rectum is commonly enjoyed in preparation for further anal sex. Anal fingering can arouse a person, allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a penis or a dildo. ==Safety== The practice is generally considered safe sex as long as the hands are protected with latex gloves. ==References== Category:Sexual acts Category:Masturbation",
