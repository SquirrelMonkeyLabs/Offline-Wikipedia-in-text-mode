 "text": "Melinoë or Meilinoë (Greek: Μηλινοη, Μειλινοη) is a deity in Greek mythology. A Chthonic goddess, originating from the Underworld, she is known as a bringer of nightmares and madness. ==Mythology== According to the Orphic Hymns, Melinöe is the daughter of Zeus and Persephone. Zeus disguised himself as Persephone's husband, Hades, in order to sleep with her. Melinöe's body is described as being black on one side and white on the other, representing her dual Olympian and Chthonic parentage. Very little is known about Melinöe, but she is possibly connected to Hecate. She may be another name for Hecate or an aspect of her. ==Religion== Melinöe was a subject of prayer for ancient Greeks seeking protecting from the supernatural. The Orphic Hymn to Melinöe involves a request for protection from ghosts. ==In popular culture== Melinoë is the protagonist of the video game Hades II. In the game, Melinoë is depicted as the daughter of Hades and the sister of Zagreus, the protagonist of Hades. ==References== * Category:Greek gods and goddesses",
