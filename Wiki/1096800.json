The bus sank quickly, the passengers were stuck underwater inside the bus. Police did not come until the next morning after being told by survivors, The police recovered the bodies of the dead people and they pulled the bus out of the dam. == Aftermath == President Thabo Mbeki held a minute's silence for the dead at his May Day speech the next day, and the dead were buried together in a mass funeral at West End (Weseinde) cemetery in Kimberley.
