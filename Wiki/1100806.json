 "text": "The Chapa bubble-nest frog, black eye-lidded small tree frog, yellow and black-spotted tree frog, or slender-legged bush frog (Gracixalus gracilipes) is a species of frog. It lives in Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and China, in Yunnan Province, Guanxi Province, and Guangdong Province. People have seen it between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests on hills. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over water that does not move. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Hoang Lien National Park. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to build roads and farms. Humans who come into the forest to hunt or take plants from the forest may bother this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
