He is the husband of the two-time Academy Award winner actress Cate Blanchett. ==Career== As a playwright, Upton created adaptations of Hedda Gabler, The Cherry Orchard, Cyrano de Bergerac, Don Juan (with Marion Potts), Uncle Vanya, The Maids, Children of the Sun and Platonov for the Sydney Theatre Company (STC) and Maxim Gorky's The Philistines for London's Royal National Theatre. ==Personal life== Upton and Cate Blanchett met in 1996 on the set of a TV show, and were married on 29 December 1997. They have four children: biological sons Dashiell John (born 3 December 2001), Roman Robert (born 23 April 2004), Ignatius Martin (born 13 April 2008), and adopted daughter Edith Vivian Patricia, whose adoption was confirmed on 6 March 2015. They lived in Hunters Hill, New South Wales, Australia, for many years. Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Upton and Blanchett purchased in early 2016 a historic $6.25 million English manor, Highwell House, in Crowborough, East Sussex, England. Variety has reported that around the same time the couple also purchased a modern-minded five-bedroom duplex apartment in downtown Sydney once owned by satirist Barry Humphries, and purchased from The Celebrity Apprentice Australia host Mark Bouris for an amount \"somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 million\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1966 births Category:Australian screenwriters Category:Australian movie directors Category:Australian playwrights Category:Living people Category:Writers from New South Wales Category:Australian theatre directors",
