Noble Wine of Montepulciano) is a red wine with Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita status produced in the vineyards in the town of Montepulciano, Tuscany, Italy. The wine is made for the main part from the Sangiovese grape varietal (minimum 70%), blended with Canaiolo Nero (10%â€“20%) and small add of other local varieties such as Mammolo. The wine is aged in oak barrels for 2 years; three years if it is a riserva. The wine should not be confused with Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, a red wine made from the Montepulciano grape in the Abruzzo region of east-central Italy. == Wines made in Montepulciano == The industry in the wine-producing town of Montepulciano produces a number of different wines: * Novello (produced not only in this region) * Rosso di Montepulciano (Red of Montepulciano) * Nobile di Montepulciano (Noble of Montepulciano) * Nobile di Montepulciano Riserva (Noble of Montepulciano Riserva) Some wineries, in addition to wines, also produce Grappa. By Italian law, the same company cannot be both a certified winery and a certified distillery, therefore, the Grappa is produced in cooperation, but, is usually sold by the winery and bears the winery name on its label. ==Other websites== # Official site of the Consorzio del Vino Nobile # Official site of the local Wine Route Organization - Strada del Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Category:Italian wines Category:Tuscany",
