 "text": "Pyrolysis is a chemical reaction where heat breaks down organic compounds (chemicals that contain carbon). Pyrolysis happens under pressure and if the temperature is above 430 °C (800 °F). Pyrolysis is different from combustion because it does not use oxygen. Pyrolysis is generally done in an inert atmosphere. It is a type of thermal decomposition. Pyrolysis converts the ingredients, called feedstock, into a mixture of gases (pyrolysis gas), liquids (tar or pyrolysis oil), and leftover solids (char). == References == Category:Organic reactions Category:Chemical processes",
