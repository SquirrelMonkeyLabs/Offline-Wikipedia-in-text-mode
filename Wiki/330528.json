 "text": "Death row is a place where people convicted of bad things go to be executed using different methods. Some are lethal injection or a gas chamber, or even an electric chair. Death row is often known as capital punishment because many years ago, people who were convicted of really bad things such as killing were executed by being hanged, drawn and quartered, firing squad, gas chamber, guillotine, or shooting. == Punishments == === Gas chamber === Gas chamber is a tool used to kill somebody by breathing in the gas and choking to death. === Guillotine === Guillotine is a tool that was used long before other tools were created. It is an object designed to cut off the head of a person by dropping a cutting tool that is controlled by a pulling object. === Firing squad === Firing squad is a killing method used in the early 1900s, including World War II. The method is used when army officers shoot a person to death. === Electric chair === The electric chair is a tool that is still used now. It is a chair with electricity flowing through it designed to shock a person and kill them in minutes. === Lethal injection === Lethal injection is a killing method that is also used to this day. It is made to inject a person with one or more drugs that will kill them in minutes, or even seconds if the drugs are very bad, or a large dose is given. ==Related pages== *Death penalty Category:Imprisonment and detention Category:Punishments Category:Capital punishment",
