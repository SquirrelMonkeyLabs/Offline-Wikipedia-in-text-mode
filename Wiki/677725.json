 "text": "The emblem of Bhutan (Dzongkha: རྒྱལ་ཡོངས་ལས་རྟགས་;Wylie: rgyal-yongs las- rtags) maintains several elements of the flag of Bhutan, with slightly different artistry, and contains much Buddhist symbolism. The official description is as follows: \"The national emblem, contained in a circle, is composed of a double diamond-thunderbolt (dorji) placed above a lotus, surmounted by a jewel and framed by two dragons. The thunderbolt represents the harmony between secular and religious power. The lotus symbolizes purity; the jewel expresses sovereign power; and the two dragons, male and female, stand for the name of the country which they proclaim with their great voice, the thunder.\" Bhutan Category:National symbols of Bhutan",
