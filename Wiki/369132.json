 "text": "The 2011 Green Bay Packers season was the franchise's 91st season in the National Football League, the 93rd season overall and the sixth under head coach Mike McCarthy. They were the defending Super Bowl 45 champions after they won against the Steelers 31-25. They not only improved from their 10-6 record but also became the sixth team to win at least 15 games. Like the 2009 Saints, 2005 Colts, and the 1998 Broncos, they won the first 13 games of the season and lost the next game. The 2009 Saints and the 1998 Broncos won their Super Bowls at that time. Even though they had a 15-1 record, they did not repeat, because they lost to the New York Giants 37-20 in the divisional rounds. ==Offseason== After finishing the 2010 regular season with a 10–6 record, the Packers went 4–0 in the postseason en route to winning Super Bowl XLV. As a result, the Packers received the final selection (32nd) in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft. ===2011 NFL Draft=== 2011 Green Bay Packers NFL Draft selections Draft order Player name Position Height Weight College Round Choice 1 32 Derek Sherrod Offensive Tackle 6'5\" 321 lb Mississippi St. 2 64 Randall Cobb Wide Receiver 5'11\" 188 lb Kentucky 3 96 Alex Green Running back 6'2\" 230 lb Hawaii 4 131 Davon House Defensive back 6'1\" 200 lb New Mexico St. 5 141 (from SF through DEN) D.
