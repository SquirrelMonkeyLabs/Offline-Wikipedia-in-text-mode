 "text": "Maiasaura was a large, plant-eating, duck-billed dinosaur. Maiasaura was the first dinosaur which was found alongside its young, eggs, and nests. This suggests that Maiasaura nurtured its young. == About Maiasaura == Maiasaura lived about 80 to 65 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous period. It ate plants, leaves and berries. Its name Maiasaura means “Good Mother Lizard”. The name refers to the find of nests with eggs, embryos and young animals, in a nesting colony. These showed that Maiasaura fed its young while they were in the nest. It was the first time such evidence was got for a dinosaur. Fully grown Maiasaura measured about 9 metres long, 2-2.5 metres tall and weighed around 1800 kg. == Where they lived == Maiasaursa fossils have been found in Montana, United States, and Alberta, Canada. == References == Category:Hadrosauridae",
