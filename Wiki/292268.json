 "text": "The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 13:47–52. It is a parable about the final judgment. It is the seventh and last parable in the chapter which began with the Parable of the Sower. ==What Jesus said== The parable: ==What it means== It is, like The Tares and the Wheat and The Sheep and the Goats, a parable about the final judgment.R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary, Eerdmans, 1985, , p. 230. Here, the edible fish must be separated from the inedible fish after they caught with a net.Catholic Encyclopedia: Parables.Craig S. Keener, A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Eerdmans, 1999, , pp. 392–394. Four of his disciples were fishermen and Jesus spoke using imagery they understood. Because it is a parable about the end of the age, a modern interpretation can be considered, with the net representing the Internet. Jesus's next words about old and new treasures indicated he did have in mind a future time. At that time, \"true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdom's treasure for all to see.\" ==References== Drawing in the Net, Parable of",
