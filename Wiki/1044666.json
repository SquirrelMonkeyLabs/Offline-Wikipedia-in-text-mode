 "text": "Erlkönig is a ballad by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He wrote it in 1782. Today, it is among his best-known works. The work has been set into music many times. Probably the most well-known setting is that by Franz Schubert. ==Name== Originally, the work was Danish, called Ellerkonge, which means Elf- king. Johann Gottfried Herder translated it into German. The name Erlkönig came from the fact that elle was translated as Erle.(a tree, called alder, in English). In Danish, elle can mean both alder, and elf. == The legend == The story of the Erlkönig derives from the traditional Danish ballad Elveskud: Goethe's poem was inspired by Johann Gottfried Herder's translation of a variant of the ballad (Danmarks gamle Folkeviser 47B, from Peter Syv's 1695 edition) into German as (\"The Erl-King's Daughter\") in his collection of folk songs, (published 1778). Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking. Niels Gade's cantata , Op. 30 (1854, text by ) was published in translation as . == Summary == An anxious young boy is being carried at night by his father on horseback. To where is not spelled out; German Hof has a rather broad meaning of \"yard\", \"courtyard\", \"farm\", or (royal) \"court\". The opening line tells that the time is late and that it is windy. As the poem unfolds, the son claims to see and hear the \"Erlkönig\" (Erl-King). His father claims to not see or hear the creature, and he attempts to comfort his son, asserting natural explanations for what the child sees – a wisp of fog, rustling leaves, shimmering willows. The Erl-King attempts to lure the child into joining him, promising amusement, rich clothes, and the attentions of his daughters. Finally, the Erl-King declares that he will take the child by force. The boy shrieks that he has been attacked, spurring the father to ride faster to the . Upon reaching the destination, the child is already dead. == Text == Literal translation Edgar Alfred Bowring's translation Who rides, so late, through night and wind? It is the father with his child. He has the boy well in his arm, He holds him safely, he keeps him warm. My son, why do you hide your face in fear? Father, do you not see the Erl-King? The Erl-King with crown and cape? My son, it is a streak of fog. \"You dear child, come, go with me! (Very) beautiful games, I play with you; Many colourful flowers are on the beach, My mother has many a golden robe.\" My father, my father, and do you not hear What the Erl-King quietly promises me? Be calm, stay calm, my child; Through dry leaves, the wind is sighing. \"Do you, fine boy, want to go with me? My daughters shall wait on you finely; My daughters lead the nightly dance, And rock and dance and sing to bring you in.\" My father, my father, and don't you see there The Erl-King's daughters in the gloomy place? My son, my son, I see it clearly: There shimmer the old willows so grey. \"I love you, your beautiful form excites me; And if you're not willing, then I will use force.\" My father, my father, he's touching me now! The Erl-King has done me harm! It horrifies the father; he swiftly rides on, He holds the moaning child in his arms, Reaches the farm with great difficulty; In his arms, the child was dead. Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear? The father it is, with his infant so dear; He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm, He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm. My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide? Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side! Dost see not the Erl- King, with crown and with train? My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain. \"Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me! For many a game, I will play there with thee; On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold, My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold.\" My father, my father, and dost thou not hear The words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear? Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives; 'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves. \"Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there? My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly care; My daughters by night their glad festival keep, They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep.\" My father, my father, and dost thou not see, How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me? My darling, my darling, I see it aright, 'Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight. \"I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy! And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ.\" My father, my father, he seizes me fast, For sorely, the Erl-King has hurt me at last. The father now gallops, with terror half wild, He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child; He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread, The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead. == Related pages == * Erlkönig (Schubert) == References == Category:German literature",
