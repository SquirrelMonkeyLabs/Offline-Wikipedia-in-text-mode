 "text": "Stockholm's historical pharmacies developed between the late 16th and early 20th centuries. These pharmacies not only provided medicine but also played a central role in public health and the city’s cultural history. Many of the original establishments have changed over time, with some becoming museums or modern pharmacies. == Early pharmacies == * Apoteket Lejonet (The Lion Pharmacy): Established in 1575 as Stockholm’s first public pharmacy, originally named \"Slottsapotek.\" Its symbol was a reclining lion, and it provided medicine for royalty and citizens during significant health crises, like the plague. * Apoteket Morianen (The Moor’s Pharmacy): Founded in 1670, this pharmacy operated at various locations, including Drottninggatan. It was known for its exotic emblem and connection to maritime medicine for Swedish ships. * Apoteket Markattan (The Monkey Pharmacy): Established in the early 1600s, this pharmacy later became \"Leoparden\" (The Leopard), reflecting its long legacy and evolution. == Role during plagues == Several pharmacies, including Apoteket Lejonet and Hvita Björnen (White Bear Pharmacy), were designated as \"plague pharmacies\" during outbreaks. These provided specific medicines for pestilent diseases, although treatments were often ineffective. A notable remedy was the \"Golden Egg,\" an expensive concoction made of herbal mixtures, though it had no real medicinal value. == Pharmaceutical practices == In the 17th century, pharmacies held exclusive rights to sell medicinal spices, oils, and even luxury items like wines. The Pharmacopoeia Holmensis listed hundreds of required substances, ranging from minerals to unusual animal products like lion’s heart and rhinoceros horn. Over time, regulations and modern medicine phased out such ingredients. == Modernization and state control == By the mid-20th century, Swedish pharmacies were nationalized under Apoteksbolaget, a government-owned company, to ensure public access to medicine. In 2009, the market was deregulated, allowing private companies to compete. Today, many historic pharmacy names survive, but the operations are modernized. == References == Category:Stockholm Category:Pharmacy",
