 "text": "Love Canal is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York. It is known as the location of a landfill that became the site of a massive environmental disaster in the 1970s. After years of dumping toxic chemicals harmed the health of hundreds of residents; the area was cleaned up over the course of 21 years in a Superfund operation. It is seen as a \"national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations\". ==References== Category:Settlements in New York (state)",
