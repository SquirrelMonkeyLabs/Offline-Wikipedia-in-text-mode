It is very social and lives in \"corsac cities\" where animals have several dens with connected holes. It prefers some steppe and semi-desert in mountainous areas. It is mainly grey-reddish with silver celadon areas on their coat. The corsac fox is threatened by hunting for the fur trade. ==References== Category:Foxes Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Mammals of Pakistan",
