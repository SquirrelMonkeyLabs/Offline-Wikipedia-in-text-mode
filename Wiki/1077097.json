 "text": "The mottled tree frog (Philautus poecilius) is a frog. It lives in the Phillippines. It lives in mountain forests near Mount Hilonghilong. People have seen it between 1600 and 1900 meters above sea level. This frog is not in danger of dying out, but there are fewer of them than there were. Scientists say that this is because human beings change the places where the frog lives so they can build farms, dig good rocks out of the ground, build towns, and get wood to build with. Other animals that humans brought to the frog's home by accident can also make life harder for this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
