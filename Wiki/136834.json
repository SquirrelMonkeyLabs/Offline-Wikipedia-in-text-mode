 "text": "Aramids are polymers. The name stands for aromatic polyamide. Structurally aramids are similar to proteins. == Overview == Stephanie Kwolek developed aramids at DuPont in 1965. DuPont uses the trade name Kevlar for them. Aramids are very present in security helmets, in splinter-resistant glass, in Ballistic vests. They are used as a replacement for asbestos as a building material, for gaskets and other sealings, but also as helpers to make sails, parachutes and similar tools. == Chemistry == Aramids are a condensation polymer made from aromatic compounds connected by amide functional groups. The usual ingredients used to make aramids are an aromatic diamine and aromatic diacyl chloride, such as p-phenylenediamine and terephthaloyl chloride. Category:Armour Category:Polymers",
