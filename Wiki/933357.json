 "text": "A capsule hotel is a lodging establishment where the rooms are sleeping compartments called capsules that each are the size of a single bed. Like in a hostel, the bathroom facilities are communal. Capsule hotels originated in Japan for long distance commuters who needed safe places to crash for the night and during the 2008 recession provided temporary housing for the underemployed. These hotels have since spread to other countries like China, Indonesia, India, Iceland, Belgium and Poland. == Name in Japanese == Japanese: カプセルホテル, romanized: kapuseru hoteru (capsule hotel) Category:Hotels",
