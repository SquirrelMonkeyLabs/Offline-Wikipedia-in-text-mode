It was based on the same game engine as Doom, and had 32 levels, two of them secret. Doom 2 got newer enemies and weapons. Enemies new in Doom 2 include the Arch-vile, Mancubus, Arachnotron, Chaingunner, Pain Elemental, Revenant, Hell Knight, and the Final Boss (also called the Icon of Sin). The only new weapon in Doom 2 is the Super Shotgun. It is a double-barrel shotgun that use two shotgun shells every time it is fired, but it does three times as much damage as the normal Shotgun and has a much wider hit box. The game's difficulty is much harder than the first Doom game. Doom 2 includes an expansion pack known as the Master Levels for Doom II. The expansion pack has 20 WAD files created by various authors under contract with id Software. Doom 2 also includes another expansion pack called No Rest for the Living, released on the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1994 video games Category:1990s horror video games Category:Doom (franchise) Category:Id Software games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Apocalyptic video games Category:Classic Mac OS games Category:Cooperative video games Category:DOS games Category:First- person shooters Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Horror video games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in hell Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
