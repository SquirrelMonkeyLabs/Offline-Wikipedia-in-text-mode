 "text": "Computer Space is a video arcade game released in November 1971 by Nutting Associates. It was created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, who later started the company Atari. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar! Eventually Nolan Bushnell, a big fan of this game, decided to transform Spacewar into a marketable game. This lead to the game's adaptation into the first ever coin operated arcade game. Computer Space was popular enough for a 2-player version with a green case and fiberglass cabinet to be released in July 1973.
