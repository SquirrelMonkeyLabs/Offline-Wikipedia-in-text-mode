 "text": "Prestvannet (Norwegian: ) is a small lake in Tromsø, Norway. It was made into a reservoir in 1867 and used for that until 1921. Since then, it's been a park and nature reserve. The area around the lake is home to many different kinds of birds, and it's an important natural area in Tromsø. There's a path that goes around the lake that people use for sports and nature walks. In the winter, the lake freezes over and is good for ice skating. Prestvannet is located in the southern part of the island Tromsøya. It is surrounded by the city of Tromsø. It's above sea level and up to four meters deep. The lake has too much phosphorus in it and is considered eutrophic. == References == Category:Bodies of water of Norway Category:Tromsø",
