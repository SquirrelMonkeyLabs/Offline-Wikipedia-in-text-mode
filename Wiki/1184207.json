 "text": "Garibaldi is a Mexican pop group, that wore a free version of the traditional charro costume while singing modern versions of traditional songs. Their dress and style of music caused controversy in their time. The name Garibaldi comes from Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City where mariachi bands can be found. The group remained active from 1988 through 1994, although it continues to be active as of 2023 with new members. The group was created by Mexican TV producer Luis de Llano Macedo during the celebration of the 175 years of Mexican Independence in the musical festival held in Acapulco, Guerrero.
