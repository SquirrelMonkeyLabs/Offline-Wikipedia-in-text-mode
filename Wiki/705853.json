 "text": "The Bamar (Burmese: ဗမာလူမျိုး bama loo-myo), Burmese or Burmans are the largest ethnic group in Myanmar. The Bamar live around the Irrawaddy River. They speak the Burmese language, the official language of Myanmar. == Where they are from == The Burmese-speaking people first migrated from Yunnan, China to the Irrawaddy valley in the 7th century. Over the following centuries, the Burmese absorbed other groups like the Pyu. DNA tests show that the Bamar are East Eurasian, related to Southeast Asian and Northeast Asian people. But they also have \"Indian influences\". == What they speak == The Bamar speak Burmese, a Sino-Tibetan language. So basic words are related to Chinese language and Tibetan language. Many words related to Buddhism are borrowed from Pali. The Burmese alphabet itself is based on Indian scripts. ==References== Category:Burmese people Category:Ethnic groups in Bangladesh Category:Ethnic groups in China Category:Ethnic groups in Japan Category:History of Myanmar",
