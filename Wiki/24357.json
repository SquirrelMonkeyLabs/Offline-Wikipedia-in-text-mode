A person who commits arson is an arsonist. Arsonists usually use gasoline or kerosene to start a fire. Arsonists use matches, Molotov cocktails and fire starters to start a fire. Arson is common in violent protests and retaliations against the government and . Arsonists deliberately burn things for what they want. This includes personal reasons, reasons related to money, or political reasons. Julio Gonzalez became one of the most prolific arsonists in history when he set fire to the Happy Land nightclub with only 6 of the 93 occupants making it out alive. Julio started the fire after the bouncer kicked him out late in the evening due to him quarreling with his girlfriend Lydia Feliciano after she recently quit her job there. She was one of the 6 people to survive the fire. The club was condemned for lacking fire escapes or sprinklers. ==References== Category:Arson Category:Types of crime",
