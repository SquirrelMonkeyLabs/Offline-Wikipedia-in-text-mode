 "text": "Louis-Antoine de Bougainville was an admiral and navigator from France. In 1766 he was sent by his government to make a trip around the world, called circumnavigation, which took from 1766 to 1769. He rediscovered (found again) the Solomon Islands in 1768 (the largest island is named for him). He also collected plants and made a trustworthy chart of some parts of the center of the Pacific Ocean. Bougainville saw a part of the Great Barier Reef, but could not find Australia. == References == == Other websites == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online *From the Warpath to the Plains of Abraham (Virtual exhibition) *Louis-Antoine de Bougainville: Eighteenth Century French Sailor, Soldier, Statesman, Mathematician and leader of a Voyage around the world Category:1729 births Category:1811 deaths Category:Admirals Category:French military people Category:People from Paris",
