 "text": "Anne of Great Britain (6 February 1665 â€“ 1 August 1714) was the Queen of England (which included Wales), Scotland and Ireland. During her reign, the kingdoms of England and Scotland came together to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain (the first form of the United Kingdom). For this reason, she is the first monarch to rule over the UK. == Becoming Queen == Anne was born during the reign of her uncle, King Charles II. After Charles' death, Anne's father James II became King of England. James was unpopular because he was Catholic. James was replaced by Anne's older sister, Mary II and her husband William III. Mary and William had no children. Anne became Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland on 8 March 1702 after the death of William. == Kingdom of Great Britain == In her first speech to the Parliament of England, Anne said it was important to unite England and Scotland. In 1707, they both formed to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. == Personal life == Anne was married to Prince George of Denmark, who died in 1708. Anne was pregnant 17 times but none of her children survived to adulthood. In her 30s, she became very ill and obese. == Death == Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714. Doctors say she died because of stress and overall poor health as well as being overweight. Because of the Act of Settlement and the fact that Anne had no surviving children, the next King of Britain was George I, her cousin. ==References== Category:1665 births Category:1714 deaths Category:House of Stuart Category:Kings and Queens of Scotland Category:Kings and Queens of Great Britain Category:17th century in Scotland",
