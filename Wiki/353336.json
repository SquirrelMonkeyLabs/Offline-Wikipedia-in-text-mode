 "text": "\"My Way\" is a song by American singer Usher. It was released from the album of the same name in 1998. It features Jermaine Dupri as backing vocalist. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 2 consecutive weeks, from August 22 to August 29, 1998. The song did not reach number one because of Brandy Norwood and Monica's single \"The Boy Is Mine\". Because \"Nice & Slow\" was not successful in the UK, \"My Way\" was not released as a single there. ==Track listing== ;US Vinyl, 12\" # My Way [Remix W/J.D.] 3:37 Rap [Featuring] - Jermaine Dupri # My Way [Remix Instrumental] 3:37 # My Way [Remix Acappella] 3:37 Rap [Featuring] - Jermaine Dupri # My Way [Album Version] 3:38 # My Way [Instrumental] 3:36 # My Way [Acapella] ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1998) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1998) Position US Billboard Hot 100 16 US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) 29 ===Decade-end charts=== Chart (1990â€“1999) Position U.S. Billboard Hot 100 81 ==References== Category:1998 songs Category:Usher songs",
