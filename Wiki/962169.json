 "text": "A one-piece swimsuit is a type of swimwear. It is usually worn by women and girls when swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool, playing water polo, or for any activity in the sun, such as sun bathing. The modern design of the one-piece swimsuit is usually a skin-tight garment that covers the torso. Some designs of the one-piece swimsuit expose the back or upper chest. ==History== Before the popularity of the bikini, almost all women's swimwear completely covered at least the wearer's torso. During that time, men also wore similar swimsuits. Although the bikini was popular and accepted in society since the 1960s, the one-piece swimsuit still remains a popular option on beaches. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Swimwear",
