 "text": "Publishing is making information available for public view. A publisher makes and sells literature or information. Publishers can pay their authors, or authors who want to be published can pay the publisher. Sometimes authors are their own publishers. Traditionally, publishing means the creation and distribution of printed works such as books and newspapers. Since the late 20th century it can also mean internet publishing. A publication is the product of publishing. Publications can be in various forms, including digital media, magazines, journals, and e-books, reaching audiences through both physical and online platforms. ==Academic publishers== * Cambridge University Press * Elsevier * Oxford University Press * University of Tokyo Press == Other websites == ;Books *Association of American Publishers *Book-Busters: Corporate Consolidation in Book Publishing and Selling and the Decline of Diversity by William Petrocelli (1999) *The British Library - finding information on the book publishing & retailing industry *Piers Anthony's Internet publishing survey *Publishers Weekly, for book publishers *A Report to the Authors Guild which reveals a \"Crisis in Midlist Publishing\" : Study (PDF file) *Society of Young Publishers *The Young Publishers Network *International Publishers Association *A list of Publishers of genre fiction such as thrillers, suspense and mystery ;Miscellaneous *Writing and Publishing Program : Online courses on writing and publishing from Simon Fraser University *Editor and Publisher magazine and information on the newspaper industry *Magazine Publishing Startup Resource Web Site for Publishers Category:Printing",
