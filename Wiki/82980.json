N. Rahul Sheel in The Tibet Journal, Vol. XIV No. 3. Autumn 1989, pp. 19-32 says on pp. 31-32, n. 1: \"The word Dalai is Mongolian for \"ocean\", used mainly by the Chinese, the Mongols, and foreigners. Rgya mtsho, the corresponding Tibetan word, always has formed the last part of the religious name of the Dalai Lama since Dalai Lama II [sic â€“ should read Dalai Lama III]. The expression Lama (Bla ma) means the \"superior one\". Western usage has taken it to mean the \"priest\" of the Buddhism of Tibet. The term Dalai Lama, therefore, means the Lama whose wisdom is as deep, as vast and as embracing as the ocean.\" He is the political and spiritual leader of Tibet. On October 6, 2009, he received the Lantos Human Rights Prize from United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In 1989 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work encouraging understanding between different religions and encouraging people and countries to care for one another. He is always working for the freedom of Tibet through dialogue, and encourages young Tibetans to study their language, history and philosophy to preserve it and to promote it to the world. ==Related pages== * Gyalo Thondup == References == Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:Dalai Lamas Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:Philosophers Category:Current national leaders Category:Spiritual teachers",
