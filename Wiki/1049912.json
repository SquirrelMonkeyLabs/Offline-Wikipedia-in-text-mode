 "text": "The 2015 UEFA Champions League final was the last match of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League season. It took place on June 6, 2015, at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany. The teams were Juventus from Italy and Barcelona from Spain. Both teams had the chance to win their national league, cup, and the Champions League, which is a big achievement. Barcelona scored first through Ivan Rakitić, then Juventus equalized with Álvaro Morata's goal. Later, Luis Suárez scored for Barcelona, and Neymar sealed their victory. It was Barcelona's fifth Champions League win and their second treble (winning all three major competitions) after 2009. Unfortunately for Juventus, it was their sixth loss in a European Cup final, which is the most by any club. As the winners, Barcelona played against the winners of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup, which they won 5–4. They also qualified for the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan and won that by beating Argentina's River Plate in the final. == How the teams got here == Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).
