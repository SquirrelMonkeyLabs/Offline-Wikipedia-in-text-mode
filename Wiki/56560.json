Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness. Rowman & Littlefield. p. viii & 102\\. ISBN 978-0-8476-9947-6. The movie is a form of historical negationism or denialism. This is when the historical facts are not represented accurately. The movie glorifies the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. This false Lost Cause claims the South had heroic and just reasons for the war and that slavery was not the main issue. There are black stereotypes in the movie. The movie shows happy enslaved people. Rhett Butler and his men are part of the Ku Klux Klan in the book, but this is not in the movie.Ruiz, W. Bryan Rommel (2010). American History Goes to the Movies: Hollywood and the American Experience. Taylor & Francis. p. 61. ISBN 978-0-203-83373-5. For some time, the movie was removed from theaters and HBO Max. This caused debates on political correctness. Since the George Floyd protests, criticism has increased.

The site claims that one should not erase the movie but understand and learn from it. == Financial Success == It made 394 million dollars when it came out. After inflation Guinness World Records says makes it the most successful movie that anyone has ever made. == References == == Other websites == * Gone with the Wind Quotes * Gone with the Wind Script/Screenplay * Gone with the Wind Trailer * * Gone with the Wind at AllMovie * Gone with the Wind at Filmsite * Gone with the Wind at Rotten Tomatoes Category:1930s American drama movies Category:1939 romantic drama movies Category:1930s epic movies Category:1930s historical movies Category:1930s war movies Category:Academy Award winning movies Category:American epic movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:American war movies Category:English-language movies Category:Histrionic personality disorder in fiction Category:MGM movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Movies set in London Category:Movies set in the 1860s Category:Movies set in the 1870s Category:Movies set in the 19th century Category:Movies about slavery Category:Screenplays by Ben Hecht Category:Movies directed by Victor Fleming Category:Movies directed by George Cukor",
