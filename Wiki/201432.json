He was famous for his frantic drumming style, his use of fills, his destructive, volatile behavior and his heavy drinking that help earn him the nickname \"Moon the Loon.\" Keith Moon joined The Who in 1964. He played on all the band's albums and singles from their debut, 1965 to 1978. Who Are You was his last album with The Who. It was released two weeks before his death. He died of an accidental drug overdose in Mayfair, London. Twelve years after his death, in 1990, Keith Moon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Who.
