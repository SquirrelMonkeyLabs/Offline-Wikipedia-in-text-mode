Before becoming emir he was the oldest crown prince in the world. ==Crown prince== Crown Prince Nawaf became emir after the death of his half-brother Sabah on 29 September 2020. According to Kuwaiti law, Nawaf had one year to pick his crown prince. After a record-short eight days, he picked his half-brother Mishal on 7 October. His pick was controversial as it showed the royal family preferred to pick older options rather than a newer generation such as Prime Minister Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah and Deputy Prime Minister Nasser Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. On 2 September 2021, Mishal spoke with US Vice President Kamala Harris about US-Kuwait relations and Kuwait's role in the evacuation of Afghanistan. Mishal has also represented Kuwait at important events abroad, including the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey, London in 2022 and the wedding of Hussein, Crown Prince of Jordan in 2023. ==Emir== Mishal became the emir of Kuwait after the death of his half-brother Nawaf Al- Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, on 16 December 2023. ==Personal life== Mishal has two wives: Nuria Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and Munira Badah Al-Mutairi.
