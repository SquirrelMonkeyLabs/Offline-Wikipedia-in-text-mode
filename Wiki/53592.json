The word is mainly used in Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Canada, and Alaska. == Australia == In Australia, the phrase, the bush, has a special symbolic meaning in Australian life. When used to describe the land, the bush means a wooded area, but not dense forest. It is usually dry and nitrogen-poor soil, mostly grassless, with thin to thick woody shrubs and bushes, with some eucalypt trees. When talking about people, the bush means any unpopulated areas outside of the major metropolitan areas. This can include mining and farming areas. It is not unusual to have a mining town in the desert, such as Port Hedland, Western Australia (Pop. 14,000) called the bush in the media.GroceryChoice useless for those in the bush The word bush is also added to any number of other words, things or activities to describe their rural, country or folk nature, e.g. \"Bush Cricket\", \"Bush Music\", etc. ==References== Category:Biomes Category:Geography of Alaska Category:Geography of Australia Category:Geography of Canada Category:Geography of New Zealand",
