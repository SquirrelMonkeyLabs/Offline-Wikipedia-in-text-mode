 "text": "On August 6, 2013, a explosion caused by a gas leak happened in a residential area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina. A building that was close by collapsed, and other buildings were at high risk of damage. Twenty- two people died and sixty were injured. Many organizations helped to make the area safe again, find survivors and give help to people who lost their homes. After the explosion, the time needed for the building to be rebuilt was estimated at six months. The local government started an investigation into how the explosion happened. People who were seen as possible blame were the Litoral Gas (the natural-gas company for Rosario) and an employee who worked at the building on the day of the explosion. == References == == Other websites == * BBC report * Timeline of related events Category:2013 in South America Category:August 2013 events Category:Disasters in South America Category:History of Argentina Category:Santa Fe, Argentina",
