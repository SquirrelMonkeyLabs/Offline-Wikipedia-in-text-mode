 "text": "Vasilissa, Holy Martyr (300309) was a small child when martyred, suffering in Nicomedia not long after the death of Anthimus. According to the Russian Orthodox tradition, the torturers covered her whole body with wounds, but she remained faithful to Christ. She was also tortured with fire and was before wild beasts, yet remained unscathed. Her torturer, Alexander, seeing those wonders, repented and became a Christian. Vasilissa went out into a field, fell on her knees and prayed to God, thanking Him for her endurance under torture, and, while thus praying, gave her soul into God's hands. She died in 309 in Nicomedia. Vasilissa, Martyr Vasilissa, Martyr Category:Russian Orthodox saints Category:Murdered children",
