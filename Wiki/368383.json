Both Czechs and Poles have their buildings on the top. The wooden chappel of St Lawrence and a new post office are in Bohemia; a big modern hotel is in Silesia (Poland). The whole area is a protected natural area. There are no trees on Sněžka because it is too high for them. Instead, there are rocks that can be dangerous to the walkers. They are recommended to wear good shoes and avoid the mountain in winter or if it is raining. Category:Mountains of Europe Category:Geography of the Czech Republic Category:Hradec Králové Region",
