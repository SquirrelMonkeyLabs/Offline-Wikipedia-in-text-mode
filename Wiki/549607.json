 "text": "Gold Star families (or Gold Star American families) are the relatives of US military members who died in battle. ==History== Starting in World War I, the families of US soldiers and sailors often flew flags that had a blue star for each member of the family that was serving in the military. If one of them died in battle, the blue star was changed to a gold star. In August of 1947, the United States Congress authorized the military to present a gold star lapel pin to the family members of those killed in action. That first pin was a simple gold star on a purple background with a laurel wreath around the star. Another pin—this time a gold star with a gold background and four oak sprigs around the star—was authorized by Congress in 1973. It was awarded to the next of kin of service members who die during military service. ==Modern use== The military continues to award Gold Star lapel pins to the family members or next of kin of service members who die during military service. == Famous Gold Star families == * Khizr Khan * General John F. Kelly * Jose Gonzalez Carranza ==References== Category:United States Army",
