 "text": "\"All Over Tonight\", also known as \"All Over Tonite\", is a song by the American heavy metal band Pantera. It was released as part of the album Projects in the Jungle on July 27, 1984 through Metal Magic Records. Terrence Lee called the song one of his favorites by the band. Him and bassist Rex Brown played it live on stage in 2010. Brown was playing with Arms of the Sun at the time, and asked for Lee to join in. ==Music video== \"All Over Tonight\" is notable for being made into the band's first music video. It starts by showing a masked man drive up to the camera in a red car. The rest of the video is the band playing the song on stage. ==Reception== Odyssey writer Matthew Clouse noted the song was \"done in the same style as many of the songs on Def Leppard’s famous album Pyromania.\" He calls it \"pretty darn good\" and \"as good as it gets through Pantera’s first 4 albums.\" AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia called the song a highlight of its album. He also praised the its riffing, and said it was similar to that of Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil.Rivadavia, Eduardo. [ \"Projects in the Jungle – Pantera\"]. AllMusic.
