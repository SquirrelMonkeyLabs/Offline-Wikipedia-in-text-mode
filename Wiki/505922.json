 "text": "A universal indicator is a test to measure the pH value of a liquid. The solution used contains several chemical indicators. The indicator is able to show different colors, and therefore pH value ranges. The drawback of this solution is that it cannot be used for titrations, which expect a well-defined change in color. pH range Description Colour < 3 Strong Acid Red 3-6 Weak Acid Orange/Yellow 7 Neutral Green 8-11 Weak Base Blue > 11 Strong Base Violet/Purple ==Related pages== * Titration *Litmus paper Category:Science Category:Chemistry",
