A 33-year-old woman, who returned from the United States at the end of February and then traveled to Lesotho before returning home to Eswatini, is currently in isolation. Two suspected cases were identified by 11 March 2020, the first a woman returning from Denmark (or possibly Germany), and the other a woman who had hosted visitors from Germany. On 24 March 2020, the ministry of health announced a fifth confirmed case. A 52-year-old male who had traveled to the United States earlier in the same month had tested positive. On 16 April 2020, the country recorded its first COVID-19-related death, a 59-year-old man with diabetes. ==References== Category:Eswatini Eswatini",
