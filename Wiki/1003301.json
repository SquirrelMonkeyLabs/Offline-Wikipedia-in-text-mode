 "text": "Romani cuisine is the cuisine of the ethnic Romani people. There is no specific \"Roma cuisine\"; it varies and is culinarily influenced by the respective countries where they have often lived for centuries. Hence, it is influenced by European cuisine even though the Romani people originated from the Indian subcontinent. Their cookery incorporates Indian and South Asian influences, but is also very similar to Hungarian cuisine. Baked hedgehog is a delicacy for Romani people in the United Kingdom and France. The hedgehog is wrapped in clay and placed on white-hot stones by the Roma gypsies. When the roasting is done, the prickles attached to the clay are pulled off and the hedgehog dish is served wrapped in leaves. There is a Romani restaurant in Maribor, Slovenia called Romani Kafenava. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Roma category:European foods",
