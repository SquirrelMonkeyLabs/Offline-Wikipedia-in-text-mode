They get the prize because their work has become well-known internationally. The prize is named after its sponsor Nobuyuki Nakahara. The purpose of the prize is to encourage young economists to publish excellent papers and books internationally. In 2016, Sagiri Kitao was the first woman to win the prize. ==Recipients== Year Recipients University 1995 Fumio Hayashi University of Tokyo 1996 Kiminori Matsuyama Northwestern University 1997 Nobuhiro Kiyotaki London School of Economics 1998 Kiyohiko Nishimura University of Tokyo 1999 Akira Okada Kyoto University 2000 Kazuya Kamiya University of Tokyo 2001 Charles Horioka Osaka University 2002 Michihiro Kandori University of Tokyo 2003 Hideshi Itoh Hitotsubashi University 2004 Hitoshi Matsushima (economist) University of Tokyo 2005 Takeo Hoshi University of California, San Diego 2006 Yuichi Kitamura Yale University 2007 Akihiko Matsui University of Tokyo 2008 Atsushi Kajii Kyoto University 2009 Hideo Konishi Boston College 2010 Takashi Kamihigashi Kobe University 2011 Atsushi Inoue North Carolina State University 2012 Mototsugu Shintani Vanderbilt University 2013 Katsumi Shimotsu University of Tokyo 2014 Kosuke Aoki University of Tokyo 2015 Keisuke Hirano University of Arizona 2016 Sagiri Kitao Keio University 2017 Hiroyuki Kasahara University of British Columbia 2018 Toshihiko Mukoyama University of Virginia ==Related pages== *John Bates Clark Medal *Yrj√∂ Jahnsson Award *Gossen Prize ==Other websites== *Japanese Economic Association: Nakahara Prize Category:Japanese culture Category:1995 establishments in Japan",
