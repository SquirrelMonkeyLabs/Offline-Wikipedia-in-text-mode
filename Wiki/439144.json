 "text": "The bow tie is a type of boys and men's necktie. It consists of a ribbon of fabric tied around the collar in a symmetrical manner such that the two opposite ends form loops. Ready-tied bow ties are available, in which the distinctive bow is sewn and a band goes around the neck and clips to secure. Some \"clip-ons\" dispense with the band altogether, instead clipping to the collar. The traditional bow tie, consisting of a strip of cloth which the wearer has to tie by hand, may be known as a \"self-tie,\" \"tie-it-yourself,\" or \"freestyle\" bow tie to distinguish it from these. ==Other websites== Category:Accessories",
