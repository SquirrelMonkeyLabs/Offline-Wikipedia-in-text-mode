 "text": "The Persecution of Uyghurs in China is all the human rights violations in Xinjiang that are hurting Uyghurs. This is being done by the Chinese government. It is estimated that there are more than a million Uyghurs being persecuted. Some governments and human rights NGOs (organisations that aren't governments) call the repression against Uyghurs a genocide (destroying a group of people). Not everybody agrees that the repression is a genocide though. The Uyghurs * have to go into concentration camps * must do lots of work (forced labor) * can not have children * are forced to listen to the Chinese government * are not allowed to practice their own religion Thousands of mosques are being destroyed and damaged. Hundreds of thousands of children are being sent to boarding schools. == References == Category:China Category:Genocides in Asia",
