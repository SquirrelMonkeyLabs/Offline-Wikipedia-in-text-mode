 "text": "The President of the Council of Ministers of Peru, informally called \"Premier\" (form of address) or \"Prime Minister\", is in charge of the Council of Ministers, and is appointed by the President, but must be approved by the Congress as with all members of the Council. The Prime Minister of Peru is, however, not the head of government, since in Peru the President is the one who serves as the head of government. Peru is one of the few countries in Latin America that has a Prime Minister. The current prime minister is Gustavo Adrianzén. He was appointed on March 6, 2024. ==Other websites== *Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros (government website) *World Statesmen – Peru *",
