 "text": "Monochrome comes from the two Greek words mono (meaning \"one\") and chroma (meaning \"surface\" or \"the colour of the skin\"). If something is monochromatic, it only has a single color. In physics, the word is used when talking about electromagnetic radiation of a single wavelength. For an image, the term monochrome usually means the same as black-and-white or grayscale. It may also be used when talking about other combinations that only have two colors, for example, green-and-white or green-and-black. In computing, monochrome has two meanings: *It may mean having only one color which is either on or off. If it also has shades of that color, then it is called grayscale. *A monochrome computer monitor can only show a single color, often green, amber, red or white. It can often also show shades of that color. Category:Color",
