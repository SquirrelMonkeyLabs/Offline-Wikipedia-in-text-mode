 "text": "The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) (also referred to as Free Capitol Hill, the Capitol Hill Free Zone (CHFZ), or the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP)) was a self-declared autonomous region that emerged in Seattle, Washington, in June 2020. It was established by protesters in response to the killing of George Floyd and aimed to challenge traditional power structures within the city and promote a peaceful approach to social justice, adopting the slogan \"Free Capitol Hill\". During its existence, CHAZ encompassed six city blocks within Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, including the area surrounding the Seattle Police Department's East Precinct, which was abandoned on June 8, 2020 when all the police left the area. Within the zone, protesters set up tents, community gardens, and established various forms of self- governance. The area functioned as a space for demonstrations and artistic expressions. The existence of CHAZ was relatively short-lived, as the Seattle Police Department eventually reclaimed the precinct and dismantled the zone in early July 2020. == Background == The Capitol Hill District had been the site of various protests in previous years, some of which involved violence between protestors and police. On May 29, 2020, many people gathered at the District's police precinct to protest the killing of George Floyd. Fighting ensued between protestors and police. After defensive measures including tear gas, OC grenades, and blast balls failed to disperse the protest, police evacuated the area. Following this, protestors claimed the area surrounding the precinct as an area independent from the city government. == Geography == There are homes in the area along with restaurants and other small businesses. The police precinct which was abandoned during the zone's existence was located near it's south eastern corner along E. Pine Street. Barricades were constructed at the zone's street entrances, using materials such cement blocks, plywood, and even vehicles. == Government == There were no paid police officers in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. There were many people who had guns in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. No one outside of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone knows who the leaders in their government were. Some people think their leader was a singer named Raz Simone. Others think their leader was Nikkita Oliver. Nikkita Oliver ran to be the mayor of Seattle, but lost the election. === Services === Tents were built for people to live in. Water, food, and soap was given to people for free. The United States Government gave toilets to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and cleaned up their trash. The United States Government said that it would have put out any fires that started in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The Government of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone made shields that can be used to fight, and gave them to its citizens. == Problems == The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone did not allow police officers from Seattle to come into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Seattle had said that it would not try to put police into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, unless someone had killed someone else, or was about to. === Shootings === On June 7, 2020, a man drove his car into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Some people say he tried to run into people with harmful intent. A person that the man did not know had attempted to get inside the car, and the driver shot the man. The man who was shot survived. On June 20, 2020, two men were shot. One of them, 19 year old Horace Anderson, had died as a result. The other man, 33 year old DeJuan Young, survived being shot. Dejuan Young says that he was shot because he was black. When police heard gunshots, attempted to enter the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, but protesters did not allow them entry. The people in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone pushed police outside. On June 21, 2020, a 17 year old man was shot in the arm. Police tried to ask him why he was shot, but the man did not want to talk to them. On June 23, 2020 at approximately 5:00am, a man who was about 30 years old was shot, and he survived the shooting. === Reporters === The government of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone said that people who work for Fox News are not allowed into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Sometimes, reporters from Fox News went into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone despite not being allowed in. If they were found by people inside the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, they would be asked to leave, or even be attacked. == Reactions == The creation of CHAZ sparked significant debates and received mixed reactions from the public, as supporters praised it as an experiment in direct democracy and grassroots organizing, highlighting its focus on community engagement and police reform. However, critics, including President Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, noted the potential safety issues, loss of public services, and the lack of legitimacy in establishing an autonomous zone within the city. The Mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkan considered it to be a party rather than an attempt at a real country. Many residents of Seattle sued the city in an attempt to move people out of the zone. == References == Category:Geography of Seattle Category:June 2020 events Category:2020 protests",
