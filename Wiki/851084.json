 "text": "James Busby (7 February 1802 – 15 July 1871) was appointed in 1833 as the British Resident in New Zealand, and became involved in drafting both the 1835 Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand and the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. As British Resident, he acted as New Zealand's first jurist and the \"originator of law in Aotearoa\", to whom New Zealand owes almost all of its underlying jurisprudence'. Jamieson, Nigel (1986), \"The Charismatic Renewal of Law in Aotearoa\", New Zealand Law Journal, July 1986, pp. 250–255 Busby is also regarded as the \"Father\" of New Zealand respectively. ==References== Category:1802 births Category:1871 deaths Category:New Zealand people Category:British colonial officials",
