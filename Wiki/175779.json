 "text": "In mathematics, a base or radix is the amount of digits that a positional system of counting uses to represent numbers. For example, the most common number system used today is the decimal system. Decimal has 10 digits, 0 to 9, so it is a base 10 system. A base is usually a whole number greater than 1, but non-integer bases are also mathematically possible. The base of a number may be written next to the number: for instance, 23_8 means 23 in base 8, which is equal to 19 in base 10. == In computers== Binary (base 2) is used by computers because it is the simplest way to represent numbers. Hexadecimal or hex (base 16) is used by many software developers because it provides a shorthand of binary at a similar scale to decimal. Hex numbers can be converted to and from binary with no math, as every 1 hex digit is exactly equal to 4 binary digits. == Measurement == The oldest systems of counting used base one, unary. Making marks on a wall, using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting. Some old systems of measurement used base twelve, or duodecimal. This is shown in English, as there are unique words for 12 (twelve or dozen), 12 * 12 (gross), and 12 * 12 * 12 (great gross). A foot is 12 inches. The 12-hour clock is also popular in English- speaking countries. Angle measurement often uses a system adapted from the Babylonian numerals with base 60. == Writing bases == When typing a base, the small number indicating the base is usually in base ten. This is because if the radix were written in its own base, it would always be \"10,\" so there would be no way of knowing what base it was supposed to be in. == Numbers in different bases== Here are some examples of how numbers are written in different bases, compared to decimal: Decimal (Base 10) Binary (Base 2) Hex (Base 16) Duodecimal (Base 12) Senary (Base 6) Unary (Base 1) 0 0 0 0 0 N/AUnary is a bijective number system, which means it has no way to write zero. 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 10 2 2 2 11 3 11 3 3 3 111 4 100 4 4 4 1,111 5 101 5 5 5 11,111 6 110 6 6 10 111,111 7 111 7 7 11 1,111,111 8 1,000 8 8 12 11,111,111 9 1,001 9 9 13 111,111,111 10 1,010 A A 14 1,111,111,111 11 1,011 B B 15 11,111,111,111 12 1,100 C 10 20 111,111,111,111 13 1,101 D 11 21 1,111,111,111,111 14 1,110 E 12 22 11,111,111,111,111 15 1,111 F 13 23 111,111,111,111,111 16 10,000 10 14 24 1,111,111,111,111,111 17 10,001 11 15 25 11,111,111,111,111,111 ==References== Category:Mathematics Category:Numbering systems",
