 "text": "War is the third studio album by Irish rock band U2, released in 1983. The band's first album, Boy is about childhood and the second album, October is about spirituality. This album is about war and politics. This is because of songs like \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". The album was named War because of what was happening in the world while they were recording. Bono said that \"everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war.\" War sold well for the band right away. Michael Jackson's album, Thriller fell from the top of the charts. War became U2's first album in the United Kingdom to reach #1. It was not well liked by British critics at first, but over the years has gained approval. ==Recording== U2 began recording War in May 1982. Bono and his bride Alison, had just been married.
