 "text": "The Scottish Land Court Act 1911 (1 & 2 Geo. 5 c. 49) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that established the Scottish Land Court to address disputes relating to agricultural tenancies and crofting in Scotland. The Act was a pivotal element of early 20th-century land reform in Scotland, particularly for the Highlands and Islands. == Background == During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, land issues in Scotland, especially in the Highlands and Islands, caused significant social and economic unrest.

The Act was introduced to provide a legal framework for addressing these issues and to balance the rights of landlords and tenants. == Other websites == * Full text of the Scottish Land Court Act 1911 at legislation.gov.uk Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Category:1910s in the United Kingdom Category:1911 Category:Scots law",
