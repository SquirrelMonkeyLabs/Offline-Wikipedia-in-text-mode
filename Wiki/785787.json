He was known for his diversity and use of colour, and involved with key movements in twentieth-century art. He was born in Taihape, New Zealand. MacDiarmid painted the portraits of Rita Angus and Theo Schoon among others. In 2016, two of his paintings sold through Art+Object for a record price (for the artist) of more than $27,000 each as part of the Tim and Sherrah Francis Collection, the highest grossing art auction in New Zealand history. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2020 deaths Category:New Zealand painters",
