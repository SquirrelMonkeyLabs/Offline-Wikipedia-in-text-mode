 "text": "The Hunting Party is the sixth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. It was released on June 17, 2014, by Warner Bros. Records and Machine Shop. Produced by Mike Shinoda and Brad Delson, it was the band's first album since Meteora (2003) not produced by Rick Rubin. This album has a heavier rock sound, different from the electronic style of their previous albums A Thousand Suns (2010) and Living Things (2012). It also features guest musicians like Page Hamilton (Helmet), Daron Malakian (System of a Down), Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine), and rapper Rakim. Five singles were released: \"Guilty All the Same,\" \"Until It's Gone,\" \"Wastelands,\" \"Rebellion,\" and \"Final Masquerade.\" The album got good reviews. Critics liked its return to a heavier sound. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 chart and was ranked number 4 on Revolverâ€™s list of the best albums of 2014. It was later certified Platinum in the U.S. for selling over one million copies. == References == Category:2014 albums Category:Linkin Park albums",
