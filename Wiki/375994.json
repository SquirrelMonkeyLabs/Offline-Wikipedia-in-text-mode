By > swimming out he was able to grasp his friend, and hold him up in the water. > Both boys shouted for help and it was obvious that they would not get ashore > unaided. By this time a rescue boat had put out from the shore but Davies > became exhausted by his efforts and before the boat could reach them he was > forced to release his hold on his friend and they drifted apart. The boat > rescued the friend but no further sign of Davies was seen. His body was > subsequently recovered. There is no doubt that in returning to the aid of > his friend after he himself had reached safety Davies gave his life in this > rescue attempt. ==References== == Other websites== * George Cross Recipients Category:1934 births Category:2021 deaths Category:British Army people Category:George Cross holders Category:British nurses Category:People from Cardiff",
