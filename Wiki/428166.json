 "text": "The Chesapeake Bay Bridge (called the Bay Bridge by locals) is a bridge that crosses Chesapeake Bay, on the eastern coast of the United States. The bridge is long. It serves as a connecting route between the eastern and western shores of Maryland. The bridge was named after William Preston Lane Jr., the governor at the time that the building of the bridge was ordered. ==Tolls and fees== A toll of six dollars is charged on the one-way toll side of the bridge (the side opposite of the Eastern Shore). Although for taxi services the fee is anywhere from 25 to 30 dollars. ==Construction== The bridge was first proposed for building in 1938. Building did not begin until 1947 because of the United States' involvement in World War II. The bridge was finally opened to traffic on July 30, 1952. Later in 1967, because traffic on the bridge was increasing, another side for the bridge was proposed. The proposal was agreed to, and funded by the state of Maryland. Building began once again in 1969 and was completed in 1973. ==Incidents== Today the Bridge is considered one of the most dangerous bridges in the world because of the accidents that have happened on it. *On August 10, 2008 a tractor trailer was involved in a head on collision, which worried people about the structure of the Bridge. Afterwards, the Maryland Transportation Comity ruled out any possibility of the accident being caused by the bridge itself. * On August 28, 2012 the bridge was seen making unusual vertical movements that were later found to be caused by two construction tarps that had been installed for a construction project, catching wind causing the bridge to slightly move. In result to the incident, traffic that day backed up almost , a record for traffic on the bridge. *On July 18, 2013 a tractor trailer was hit from behind, forcing it over the edge of the bridge, falling a total of into the water, where the driver then was able to open the door and swim to the Eastern Shore and receive help. ==References== *Roads to the Future Website *Chesapeake Bay Bridge Fundamental *Official PDF for Bridge Finances Category:Bridges in the United States Category:1952 establishments in the United States Category:20th- century establishments in Maryland Category:Transport in Maryland",
