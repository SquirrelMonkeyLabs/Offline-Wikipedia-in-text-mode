 "text": "North Pole is a city in Alaska. It is hundreds of miles from the actual North Pole, which is under the Arctic Ocean and very hard to get to. The town of North Pole is about from Fairbanks, the only big city in the Interior of Alaska. At first it was just a small settlement called \"Davis\" with a stop on the Alaska Railroad. The first people to form a local government there decided to call it North Pole. Soon a trading post that had been opened there became a Christmas themed shop called the Santa Claus House and was a big attraction for tourists who came to Alaska. The city's mayor pro tem was city council member Santa Claus. == References == Category:Cities in Alaska",
