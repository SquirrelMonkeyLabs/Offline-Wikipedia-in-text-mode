 "text": "Chris Thile () (born February 20, 1981) is an American musician, best known as a member of acoustic band Nickel Creek. He has made six albums as a solo artist and with his band, Punch Brothers. His first, Leading Off, was released in 1994 when Thile was 13. Thile has also played and recorded with artists like Mike Marshall, Béla Fleck, Glen Phillips, and Edgar Meyer. Thile's third album, Not All Who Wander Are Lost, was released in 2001. His fourth, Deceiver had all songs written and performed by Thile alone. His most recent solo work was 2006's How to Grow a Woman from the Ground, and Thile released Punch in 2008 with the band Punch Brothers. ==History== ===1981–1999: Early life and career=== Thile was born in Oceanside, California in 1981. When he was two, his family started going to That Pizza Place, where he listened to John Moore's band Bluegrass Etc. When Thile was four, his family moved to Idyllwild, California. He started playing mandolin at the age of five. He took lessons from John Moore. When Thile was eight, Nickel Creek was formed. After playing many music festivals with Nickel Creek, he won the national mandolin contest at the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas at age twelve. In 1993, Thile was signed to the bluegrass record label Sugar Hill. The next year, he released his first album, Leading Off, and most of the songs were written by Thile. In 1997, Thile released Stealing Second and Nickel Creek released Here to There. ===2000–2005: Wander and Deceiver=== After Nickel Creek sold 500,000 copies, Thile released Not All Who Wander Are Lost in 2001. The name of the album comes from a quote in J. R. R. Tolkien's book The Lord of the Rings. The album had guest appearances from his Nickel Creek bandmates as well as Stuart Duncan, Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Jerry Douglas, and Bryan Sutton. In 2003, Thile and mandolinist Mike Marshall made a duet album called Into the Cauldron, which had covers by artists from Charlie Parker to Bach. The next year, Thile released Deceiver, a pop album on which he played and wrote every song himself. He mainly played his mandolin on the album, but also played electric guitar, piano, drums, violin, viola, cello, and bass. ===2006–present: Punch Brothers=== In August 2006, Nickel Creek announced in Billboard and on their official website that they would take an indefinite hiatus, which means a break for an unknown amount of time. Just before this, Thile formed the How to Grow a Band. He made How to Grow a Woman from the Ground, with them. This was Thile's fifth album. In an interview with the Nashville City Paper, Thile talked about the band's start: The band's members are Thile (mandolin), Gabe Witcher (fiddle), Chris Eldridge (guitar), Greg Garrison (bass), and Noam Pikelny (banjo). Bryan Sutton also played guitar for the band when Chris Eldridge could not. In 2007, the band changed its name twice: first to \"The Tensions Mountain Boys\" and then \"Punch Brothers.\" Punch Brothers released their first album, Punch, on the Nonesuch Records on February 26, 2008. The album has Thile's four piece song \"The Blind Leaving the Blind\", along with other original songs. ==Awards and nominations== * 1996 – Nominated for Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance for \"Scotland\" from True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe * 1997 – IBMA award for Album of the Year for True Life Blues: The Songs of Bill Monroe * 2001 – IBMA award for Mandolinist of the Year * 2002 – Won Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album for This Side (with Nickel Creek) * 2005 – Nominated for Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for Deceiver * 2006 – Nominated for Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance for \"The Eleventh Reel\" * 2007 – BBC's Folk Musician of the Year * 2007 – Nominated for IBMA Mandolinist of the Year * 2008 – Nominated for Americana Music Association Instrumentalist of the Year * 2012 – Nominated for Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album for Sleep with One Eye Open (with Michael Daves) * 2012 – MacArthur Fellowship ($500,000 'Genius Grant') * 2013 – Won Grammy Award for Best Folk Album for The Goat Rodeo Sessions (with Yo-Yo Ma, Stuart Duncan, and Edgar Meyer) * 2014 – Won Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album for Bass & Mandolin (with Edgar Meyer)\"Grammys 2015: Complete list of winners and nominees\".
