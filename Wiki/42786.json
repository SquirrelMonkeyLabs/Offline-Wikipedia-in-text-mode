 "text": "Indium is a chemical element. It has the chemical symbol In. It has the atomic number 49. It is a rare metal which is soft, malleable, and poor (post- transition). Indium looks like zinc. Pieces of indium can easily be joined by pushing one piece into another. The chemistry of indium is quite like aluminium or gallium. Zinc ores are the main source of indium. == Uses == The main use of indium is in the chemical compound indium tin oxide in liquid crystal displays. It is also used in very thin layers as a lubricant. In World War II it was used to coat bearings in aircraft. Like other group 13 elements, indium is used to make III-V semiconductors. Indium phosphide and indium arsenide are binary (two-element) semiconductors made with indium. It is also used as a dopant for other semiconductors like boron nitride and silicon.
