It lives in India and Myanmar. Scientists think it may live in Nepal also. People have seen it between 1336 and 1600 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests on hills and mountains and in forests that have been cut down and grew back. People have also seen it in bamboo plants. It does not live in places where too many trees have been cut down. The female frog lays eggs in bits of water high up in the trees. The water is in holes in the trees. The tadpoles swim in the water and eat eggs. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. Some of the places where the frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
