 "text": "The Women's State of Origin is a women's rugby league series held every year in Australia. It is played between two teams: New South Wales (nicknamed the \"Blues\") and Queensland (nicknamed the \"Maroons\"), with the Maroons being by far more successful. It is the women's equivalent of the State of Origin series. Unlike the men's series, until 2023, the Women's State of Origin was a one-off game. In 2023, it became a series. Matches in the Women's State of Origin have been played in five cities in Queensland (Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Gympie, the Sunshine Coast and Townsville) and two cities in New South Wales (Sydney and Wollongong), plus one match has been played in the Australian Capital Territory (Canberra). ==References==",
