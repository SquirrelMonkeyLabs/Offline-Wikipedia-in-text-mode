 "text": "In syntactic analysis, a constituent is a word or a group of words that functions as one unit within a hierarchical structure. Phrases (noun phrases, verbal phrases, etc.) are usually constituents of a clause, but clauses may also be combined into a bigger structure. For example, in the phrase \"I didn't hear what you said,\" the subordinate clause \"what you said\" is combined into the main clause and is syntactically its object; this can be demonstrated by substituting the pronoun \"it\" for the subordinate clause \"I didn't hear it.\" Category:Linguistics",
