 "text": "Ichnology is the study of trace fossils of once-living things. Burrows, trackways, trails and borings are all examples of traces made by organisms. Scientists study traces made by plants and animals to try to determine their behavior. An ichnologist is a scientist whose area of study and research is ichnology. A species name given to a fossil is called an ichnospecies. It is written in italics with a lower case initial. It is shown to be an ichnospecies by the abbreviation \"isp\". == Examples == *Later Cambrian trace fossils from intertidal settings include Protichnites and Climactichnites, and others. *Mesozoic dinosaur footprints including Ichnotaxon such as Grallator and Atreipus (bipedal theropods) and Anomoepus. *Triassic to Recent termite mounds, which can be several square kilometers of sediment *Possible Avian footprints such as Saurexallopus. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Subfields of paleontology Category:Taxonomy",
