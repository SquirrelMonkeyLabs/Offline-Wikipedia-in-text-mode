 "text": "The siege of Mariupol was military engagement between Russia and Ukraine which began on 24 February 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The city of Mariupol is located in the Donetsk Oblast in eastern Ukraine. It is claimed by the Russian-backed separatist Donetsk People's Republic. The Red Cross said the siege is \"apocalyptic\", and Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of causing a major humanitarian crisis in the city, with city officials reporting that over 2,000 civilians have been killed. The siege has been compared by Ukrainian and US officials to the siege of Leningrad during World War II. The siege ended on 16 May 2022 after what Western media outlets called the \"evacuation\" of the remaining Ukrainian personnel from the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works; the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that the Ukrainians had \"surrendered\". Aftermath: the theater building that was bombed, is now behind tall screens, so that the general public can not see the damaged building; Media showed (in 2023) a picture of that building; The picture was taken above the screen.https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/P4jGmz/foerst-la- russerne-den-ukrainske-byen-i-grus-naa-bygger-russerne-den-opp-som-sin-egen.
