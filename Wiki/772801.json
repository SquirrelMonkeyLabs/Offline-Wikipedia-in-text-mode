 "text": "Institutional racism is a form of racism embedded in social institutions. ==Overview== Institutional racism is also called systemic racism because it exists within the systems that make up societies. People usually see racism as thoughts of hatred and prejudice against other races, but institutional racism means that those feelings are present in the ways social interactions take place. Institutional racism is not new, but the term is. Civil rights leaders Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton were among the earliest users of the term. ==North America== ===United States=== Institutional racism is a huge issue in the United States (US). In the past, Black Americans were not allowed to live in certain neighborhoods. For instance, banks would not give them loans to live in the same neighborhoods as White people. As a result, many Black Americans live in areas with higher rates of poverty and lack of access to resources, including parks and good schools. ==Related pages== * Afrophobia * Antiziganism * Antisemitism * The Holocaust ==References== Category:Racism Category:Culture",
