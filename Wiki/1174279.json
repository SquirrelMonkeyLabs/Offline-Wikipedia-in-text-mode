In addition to airfields and natural wonders, the races are primarily held on water close to cities. They are accompanied with a show flight accompanying program. Typically, races take place on weekends, with qualifying taking place on the first day and the elimination finals the following day. The activities draw sizable crowds and are televised live and on tape in numerous countries.",
