 "text": "A stellar black hole (or stellar-mass black hole) is a type of black hole formed by the gravitational collapse of a star. For one to be made, a star five to several tens the mass of our Sun must explode into a supernova. The process is seen as a hypernova explosion, or as a gamma ray burst. These black holes are also called collapsars. == References == \\+",
