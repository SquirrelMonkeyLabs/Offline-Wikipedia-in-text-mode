 "text": "Goheimochi is a local cuisine made in the mountains in the ChÅ«bu region of Japan. It started in the Edo period, when rice was very valuable. Pounded rice is wrapped around a thin wooden stick, then grilled with miso, sugar, and mirin. Soy sauce, sesame, and walnuts can also be used. It is particularly famous in Nagano Prefecture where it is shaped like dango or traditional Japanese straw sandals called waraji. ==References== Category:Japanese food",
