In May 2018, the United States moved its embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In mid- October 2018, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the Consulate General would merge with the US Embassy in Jerusalem and that relations with the Palestinians would be conducted through a special Palestinian affairs unit inside the embassy. On March 4, 2019, the Consulate General officially ceased operations and merged with the US Embassy in Jerusalem. ==History== The US Consulate was opened in 1844 in Old Jerusalem, inside Jaffa Gate, in what is today the Swedish Center for Christian Studies. In the late 19th century, the consulate was moved to Al-Anbiya Street. In 1912, it was moved to Kershon Akron Street, in what is now West Jerusalem. The main building, one of the first houses built outside the old city walls, was built in 1868 by the German Lutheran missionary Ferdinand Vester. On May 23, 1948, Consul General Thomas Wesson was assassinated. In 1952, the consulate rented another building on Nablus Road, East Jerusalem. On December 1, 2017, two senior US officials revealed that US President Donald Trump is likely to deliver a speech, Wednesday, December 6, in which he recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and will postpone the transfer of the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. == References == Category:foreign relations of the United States",
