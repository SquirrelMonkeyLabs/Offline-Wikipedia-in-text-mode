 "text": "Ivermectin is a medication used to treat parasite infestations. They can treat head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation has been widely spread saying that ivermectin is beneficial for treating and preventing COVID-19. Though this cannot be proven to be true or false. General confusion, the \"infodemic\" and the lack of effective treatment seemingly attributed to individuals to repurpose various medications - including ivermectin - on the market without approved indications for COVID-19 as potentially effective treatments and purchase them from unapproved websites. ==References== Category:Insecticides Category:Drugs",
