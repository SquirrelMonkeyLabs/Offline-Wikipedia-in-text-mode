 "text": "Nigeria, We Hail Thee is the national anthem of Nigeria. Written by British expatriate Lillian Jean Williams and composed by Frances Benda in 1959, it served as Nigeria's anthem from its independence on October 1, 1960, until it was replaced by \"Arise, O Compatriots\" in 1978. The anthem was officially reinstated on May 29, 2024, following a bill signed into law by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. LYRICS Stanza 1: Nigeria, we hail thee, Our own dear native land, Though tribe and tongue may differ, In brotherhood we stand, Nigerians all, and proud to serve Our sovereign Motherland. Stanza 2: Our flag shall be a symbol That truth and justice reign, In peace or battle honored, And this we count as gain, To hand on to our children A banner without stain. Stanza 3: O God of all creation, Grant this our one request, Help us to build a nation Where no man is oppressed, And so with peace and plenty Nigeria may be blessed History \"Nigeria, We Hail Thee\" was introduced in 1960 as Nigeria's first national anthem to reflect the country’s newfound independence and unity. It was created in anticipation of Nigeria's transition to self-governance, with the lyrics emphasizing patriotism, service, and divine guidance. In 1978, it was replaced by \"Arise, O Compatriots\" after concerns that the anthem lacked local input, as it was written and composed by expatriates. In 2024, a renewed sense of nostalgia and calls to return to Nigeria's roots led to the anthem's reinstatement. Significance The anthem is a tribute to Nigeria's diversity and unity, calling on citizens to honor the sacrifices of the nation’s founders. Its reinstatement symbolizes a recommitment to Nigeria's foundational ideals and values. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of Nigeria",
