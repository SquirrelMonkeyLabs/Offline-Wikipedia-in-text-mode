 "text": "Salustiano Sánchez-Blazquez (8 June 1901 – 13 September 2013) was a Spanish- born American supercentenarian. == Biography == Born in El Tejado de Bejar, Spain, on 8 June 1901 (he claimed to be born in 1902), Sánchez emigrated to Cuba at age 17 and worked as a farmer, before emigrating in 1920 to the United States where he lived until his death and worked as a coal miner. In 1934, he married Pearl Emilie Chiasera and had the son John and the daughter Irene, whom he lived with after his wife's death in 1988 to 2007 when he moved to a retirement home in Grand Island, New York, and lived there until his death at age 112 years, 97 days, and believed the secret to his long life to be one banana and one tablet of Anacin a day. At age 112, he had 7 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and 5 great-great-grandchildren including Chase, Evan, and Hailey Spurback and Jacob and Ethan Macendrick. == World's oldest man == Sanchez became the oldest living man in the United States after Shelby Harris' death on 25 July 2012 and was exactly one year later officially verified to be the oldest living man in the world since 116-year-old Japaneseman Jiroemon Kimura's death at 2:08 a.m. the night of 12 June 2013 (=1:08 p.m. the afternoon of 11 June 2013 New York Time), which, however, before the verification of Sánchez was believed to be Canadian-born Californian man James McCoubrey (who died of pneumonia on 5 July 2013) followed by Jokichi Ikarashi (who also died of pneumonia just 18 days after McCoubrey) and Italian Arturo Licata who, however, was believed to have become the oldest living man when Sánchez died of natural causes at age 112 years, 97 days on 13 September 2013 (coincidencially on the same day as McCoubrey would have turned 112) while Polish-born Alexander Imich was believed to be the oldest living U.S. man. However, Ernest Peronneau, who was believed to be born 6 March 1903, was later verified to be born 7 March 1902, and was the oldest living man until his death on 26 March 2014,https://longeviquest.com/2023/10/new-validation-ernest- peronneau-of-the-united-states-1902-2014/ which made Licata the oldest living man first after Peronneau's death. == References == Category:1901 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Castile and León Category:People from New York (state) Category:Spanish supercentenarians Category:American supercentenarians",
