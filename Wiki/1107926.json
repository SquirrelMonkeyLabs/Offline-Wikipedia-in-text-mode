 "text": "The ugly duckling theorem is an argument showing that classification is not really possible without some sort of bias. The theorem is named after Hans Christian Andersen's 1843 story \"The Ugly Duckling\", because it shows that a duckling is just as similar to a swan as two swans are to each other. It was derived by Satosi Watanabe, in 1969. == Example == Trait Tennis ball Basketball Football Small Brown Round Suppose we have three objects: a tennis ball, an American football, and a basketball. These three balls have three \"obvious\" properties: their size, colour, and shape. * The tennis ball is small, not brown, and round. * The American football is not small, brown, and not round. * The basketball is not small, brown, and round. According to these properties, the \"ugly duckling\" is the tennis ball, because the other two objects share the categories \"brown\" and \"not small\". The ugly duckling theorem relies on the ability to find additional properties from those which are provided. Trait Tennis ball Basketball Football Small and brown Small Brown and round Brown and not round Round Small or not round Brown Small or brown The table to the right shows a selection of derived properties. In fact, these derived properties include every possible property up to equivalence: each one corresponds to one possible grouping (subset) of the original three balls. There is no logical reason that the \"original\" properties are more important than the \"derived\" ones. Because the derived properties are found using fundamental logic, they are equivalent to the original properties. This list of all logical properties of the items has every item differ in exactly four places - when all logical properties are considered, all of the objects are just as similar as they are different. The idea that we prioritize the three \"obvious\" properties exists outside the logic, so it is called arbitrary or biased. By applying the rules of logic alone, we get the result that all objects are equally different; there is no \"ugly duckling\". == References == Category:Logical paradoxes",
