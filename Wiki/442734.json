He played with the Minnesota North Stars. Pašek was drafted with the 81st overall pick by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. He also played for Czechoslovakia at the 1984 Winter Olympics where they won a silver medal. When he retired, he became the president of the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation. On 15 March 1998, Pašek committed suicide by gunshot in his office at Slovan Bratislava in the wake of Slovakia's disappointing performance at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He left six suicide notes for his wife, his three children, the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation and Slovan Bratislava officials. He said that he was sorry for killing himself and asked that others try to understand his decision. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1960 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Czechoslovak ice hockey players Category:Minnesota North Stars players Category:Sportspeople from Bratislava Category:Slovak ice hockey centres Category:Olympic silver medalists for Czechoslovakia Category:Olympians for Slovakia Category:Sportspeople who committed suicide Category:Suicides by firearm",
