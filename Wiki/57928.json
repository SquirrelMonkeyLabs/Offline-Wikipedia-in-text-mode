 "text": "Serpa solar power plant (also known as HÃ©rcules solar power plant) is a power plant found in Serpa, Portugal. It was begun in June 2006 and finished in January 2007. The plant consists of a photovoltaic system that uses silicon solar cell technology to convert sunlight directly into energy. The Serpa solar power plant uses 52,000 photovoltaic modules manufactured by SunPower, Sanyo, and Sharp. The plant uses a new tracking system that follows the Sun's daily path across the sky. Generating electricity from the sun with no fuel costs or emissions, the Serpa plant is on a 60-hectare (150-acre) hillside and is a model of clean power generation integrated with agriculture. The project saves more than 30,000 tons a year in greenhouse gas emissions compared to equivalent fossil fuel generation. ==Notes== Category:2007 establishments in Europe Category:2000s establishments in Portugal Category:Buildings and structures in Portugal Category:Solar power plants",
