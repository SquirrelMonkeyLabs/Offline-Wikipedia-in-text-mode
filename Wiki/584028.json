 "text": "Ronald Charleston \"Ron\" Packard, D.M.D. (born January 19, 1931) is a retired Republican politician from California. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 2001. In 1982, Packard lost the Republican primary for the United States House of Representatives in a crowded field of candidates to Johnnie Crean by 92 votes. After Crean faced controversy, such as laying about being endorsed by then-President Ronald Reagan, Packard ran as a write-in candidate. He won the election in 1982 beating Crean. Packard won the election by 11,000 votes to become the first independent write-in candidate to defeat candidates of both the Democratic and Republican parties. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:United States representatives from California Category:Politicians from Idaho Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
