 "text": "Halifax is a large town in West Yorkshire in England. The town has about 88,000 people living in it. Halifax is close to Huddersfield and Bradford. It is near the \"spine\" of England, the Pennines. It is easy to get to Liverpool and Manchester on the west coast, and Leeds and Wakefield to the East. There is a motorway-standard road which goes over the Pennines. Halifax is on the M1 motorway and the M60 motorways. The economic booms in Leeds and Manchester, particularly in the financial sector, have led to Halifax becoming a commuter town for these two cities. Halifax has a historic town centre. There is a lot of Victorian architecture in the town centre. Landmarks include the Town Hall, Piece Hall, the Wainwright monument, the Square Chapel and Halifax Minister. Halifax Station is on the main-line to London, King's Cross Station. What Halifax was known for is making cloth. Its Dean Clough was one of the largest textile factories in the world. It was more than 1‚ÅÑ2 mile (800 m) long. Today it is converted to hotel, office and retail use.Hargreaves, John A. 1999. Halifax. Edinburgh University Press. ISBN 1-85331-217-7 == References ==",
