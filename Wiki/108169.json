 "text": "In the fictional story Animal Farm, published by George Orwell in 1945, Benjamin the donkey, is the oldest animal on Manor Farm, and very cool- tempered. He seldom speaks, except to make some cynical remark. He is the only animal on the farm that never laughs, saying that there was nothing to laugh at when asked about it. In addition to that he is one of the few animals that can read. Without admitting it, Benjamin is devoted to Boxer, grazing with him in a small paddock near the orchard on Sundays. He was not changed by the rebellion that took place towards the beginning of the novel. Category:Animal Farm characters",
