 "text": "Welnos is an Indo European deity linked to cattle, and there are similar gods in many mythologies such as Slavic, Lithuanian, Latvian, Norse, and Old English. ==Overview== Welnos was reconstructed from the Slavic god Veles, Lithuanian god Velnias, and Latvian god Velns, who all protected flocks. The name of this god is also similar to Old Norse Ullr and Old English Wuldor.Jaan Puhvel, Analecta Indoeuropaea, (a collection of articles), publ. by Innsbrucker Beitrage zur Sprachwissenschaft, Innsbruck, 1981 ==Academic views== Scholar Jaan Puhvel thought Welnos is also connected to the Elysian fields in Greek myth and ritual. Some scholars, such as Max Muller, believed that Welnos, was related to Sanskrit Varuna and Greek Ouranos. However, this theory has been rejected because of language reasons, and the origin of the word is no longer accepted..The Journal of Indo-European Studies, publ. by JIES, Washington, DC., 1973 and continuing Welnos may have been a kind sky father who represented the night while DyÄ“us represented the day and danger. He might have had a competition with Perkwunos like Perun and Veles.https://www.bib.irb.hr/988715/download/988715.Belaj_J_V.pdf ==Related pages== * Paganism * Slavic peoples * Eastern Europe * History of Europe ==References== Category:History of Europe Category:Proto-Indo-European gods and goddesses",
