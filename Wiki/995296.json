 "text": "Jacob Bernoulli (also known as James' or Jacques) (December 27, 1654 â€“ August 16, 1705) was a Swiss mathematician. He mainly contributed to Analytic geometry, Probability theory, Variable calculus. Bernoulli's inequality which is often taught in high schools was named to honor him. Bernoulli, together with Newton and Leibniz, was considered the first ones who developed the Differential calculus and Integral but he researched deeper insights. His book on Probability Theory had not been published until 1713, 8 years after Bernoulli's death. He had a younger brother 12 years younger who was also a famous mathematician Johann Bernoulli. The Bernoulli family later had many talented mathematicians. Jacob's parents compelled him to study philosophy and theology, which he greatly resented. He graduated from the University of Basel with a master's degree in philosophy in 1671 and a licentiate in theology in 1676. == References == Category:Swiss mathematicians Category:1650s births Category:Number theorists Category:1705 deaths Category:Scientists from Basel",
