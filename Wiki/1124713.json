 "text": "Lehmann's rocket frog (Hyloxalus lehmanni) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador and Colombia. ==Body== The adult male frog is 15.4–20.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 17.0–22.8 long. There is a line down each side of the body, over the eye. The male and female frogs have different colors on their bellies: Male frogs have black bellies and female frogs have gray or white bellies. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for F. Carlos Lehmann V. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests on mountains with water in the air. People also see them in fields and in places that have been changed. But they only see it near streams. People have seen this frog between 1460 to 2120 meters above sea level. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Reserva Ecológica Los Illinizas, Bosque Piemontano Occidental, and Bosque Montano Occidental. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. The male frog carries the tadpoles to streams where the water moves slowly. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because people cut down forests to make farms, to make farms that are against the law, to cut down trees to get wood to build with, and build places for people to live. Fires also burn forest. People who grow plants against the law put chemicals meant to kill pests and make plants grow on them. This makes pollution that can kill this frog. Fish that people brought to the area also hurt this frog. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis killed many of these frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
