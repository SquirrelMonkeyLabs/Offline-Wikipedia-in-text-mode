Should tyrants come, may your heart long for freedom. Togo arise, let us fight without faltering. Victory or death, but in dignity. God almighty, You alone have exalted us From Togo for prosperity. Togolese come, let us build the state. II In unity we want to serve you, It is indeed the most burning desire of our hearts. Let us loudly proclaim our motto, Which nothing can tarnish. Sole architect of your happiness, as well as your future, Let us break the chains of treachery everywhere, And we swear loyalty to you always, And to love to serve, to surpass ourselves, To make you yet, without tiring, Dear Togo, the gold of humanity. III Hail, hail to the entire universe. Let us unite our efforts on the immense building site From which will be reborn completely anew Great Humanity. Everywhere, instead of misery, let us bring happiness. Let us chase from the world rebellious hatred. Slavery and captivity is over. To the star of liberty, Let us renew the solidarity Of nations in fraternity. === In local languages === Ewe lyrics Kabiye lyrics ==References== Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of Togo",
