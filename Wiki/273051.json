 "text": "To Anacreon in Heaven, also known as the Anacreontic Song, was the official song of the Anacreontic Society. The Anacreontic society was a gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London during the 18th century. It was written by John Stafford Smith, a British Mason of Inverness Lodge #4 in London. At one point, the song was used by an Irish Masonic Orphans' Home as their song. Later, it became a popular English drinking song, and was called To Anacreon in Heaven. It is about a Greek poet named Anacreon. The song is not sung very much anymore. However, the music was used by Francis Scott Key for The Star- Spangled Banner, the national anthem of the United States. Category:18th- century songs Category:1770s works",
