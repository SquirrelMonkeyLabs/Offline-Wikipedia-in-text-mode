Human beings also brought it to Puerto Rico. The adult male frog is 3.1 to 3.7 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 4.0 to 4.2 cm long. The male frog is yellow or almost white in color and the female frog is brown or gray in color. This frog has dark brown spots down its sides and yellow or orange spots on its legs and middle. This frog lives in trees and looks for food at night. This frog can lay eggs at any time, but it usually does when the weather is rainy. The male frog sits on a tree branch over the water and sings for the female frog. The female frog lays her eggs, about 590 eggs at a time, on plants near the water. When the tadpoles hatch from the eggs, they fall into the water. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Frogs of North America",
