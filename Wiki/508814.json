Her father is William Sánchez. Her mother is Maria Eumelia Cordero. Her father worked for the railroad. Later, when Cuba's national railroads had problems, he worked to fix bicycles. When Sanchez was in primary school, Cuba was rich, because it received money from the Soviet Union. Later, when Sanchez was in high school and university, the Soviet Union had problems, Cuba lost the money, and Cuba's culture changed. Sanchez went to high school in the countryside\". She wrote: \"I left high school in the countryside feeling that nothing belonged to me, not even my body. Living in shelters creates the sensation that your whole life, your privacy, your personal possessions and even your nakedness has become public property.\" Sanchez decided she wanted privacy. For two years, Sánchez went to the university at Instituto Pedagógico. She studied Spanish literature. Then she went to the Faculty of Arts and Letters in 1995. She got a degree in Hispanic philology and a specialty in contemporary Latin American literature. == Work == In 2000, Sanchez worked for Editorial Gente Nueva, a publisher of children's books. Then Sanchez worked as a Spanish teacher for German tourists in Havana.\" In 2002, Sánchez went to Switzerland. Two years later, she went back to Cuba. Back in Cuba, Sánchez started the magazine Consenso, later named Contodos. Sánchez is also involved with the digital magazine Convivencia. In 2007, Sánchez went to the \"debate of the intellectuals\", a conference at the House of The Americas. It was a discussion among intellectuals about Cuba’s culture. But Sanchez and others were not allowed inside, so they wrote emails. The emails became the digital magazine Contodos This was the reason Sánchez started her blog, Generation Y. In November 2008, Sánchez was invited to write her blog entries on The Huffington Post. ==Awards== *2008 – Ortega y Gasset Prize for Journalism *2008 – \"100 Most Influential People in the World” – Time magazine *2008 – \"100 most notable Hispanoamericans\" – El País newspaper *2008 – \"10 most influential people of 2008\" – Gatopardo Magazine *2008 – “10 Most Influential Latin American Intellectuals” of the year – Foreign Policy magazine *2009 – \"25 Best Blogs of 2009\" – Time magazine *2009 – \"Young Global Leader Honoree\" – World Economic Forum *2009 – Maria Moors Cabot prize – Columbia University Prize *2010 – World Press Freedom Hero – International Press Institute *2010 – Prince Claus Award – Prince Claus Fund *2011 – International Women of Courage Award – U.S. Department of State *2012 – “10 Most Influential Ibero American Intellectuals” of the year – Foreign Policy magazine == References == == Other websites == *Generation Y website * 2011 International Women of Courage Awards, U.S. State Department photostream on Flickr *Secretary's International Women of Courage Award (U.S. Department of State) Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Human rights activists Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:People from Havana Category:HuffPost writers and columnists Category:Women who received the International Women of Courage Award Category:Cuban writers Category:Cuban activists",
