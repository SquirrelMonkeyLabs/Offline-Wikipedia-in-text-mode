 "text": "The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission, was set up on November 27, 2002, \"to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks\". It also gave tips on how the country can respond to further attacks. Chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, the commission consisted of five Democrats and five Republicans. The commission was created by Congressional legislation, with the bill signed into law by President George W. Bush. After the publication of its final report, the commission closed on August 21, 2004. The commission's website was shut down, but has been archived. ==References== Category:September 11 attacks",
