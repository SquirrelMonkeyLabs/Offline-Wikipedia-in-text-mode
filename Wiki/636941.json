 "text": "The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC, or House Committee on Un- American Activities, or HCUA) was an investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives. The HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having communist ties. In 1969, the House changed the committee's name to \"House Committee on Internal Security\". When the House abolished the committee in 1975, its functions were transferred to the House Judiciary Committee. The committee's anti-communist investigations are often associated with those of Joseph McCarthyFor example, see who, as a U.S. Senator, had no direct involvement with this House committee.Patrick Doherty, Thomas. Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture. 2003, pages 15-16. McCarthy was the chairman of the Government Operations Committee and its Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate, not the House. ==References== Category:1938 establishments in the United States Category:1975 disestablishments in the United States Category:Cold War Category:United States House of Representatives",
