 "text": "Izecksohn's Brazilian tree frog (Xenohyla truncata) is a frog that lives in Brazil. It is the only frog that eats fruit. Scientists have seen it no higher than 50 meters above sea level. Some of these frogs live near sand dunes where there are cacti, shrubs, and bromeliad plants. The frogs can also live in trees where the adults hide in bromeliad plants. When it is time to lay eggs, they climb down to the forest floor. They lay eggs in pools of water that dry up for part of the year. Xenohyla truncata is the only known amphibian that eats fruit. It finds the fruit and swallows it whole with no chewing. The seeds from the fruit come out of its body in its waste, which helps the plant spread. This frog only eats very small fruits and seeds, from 3 to 10 mm in size. Scientists think this frog could be a pollinator. It moves the tree's pollen, or seed-making material, from plant to plant as it looks for food. This is important because most of the pollinators we know of are insects and other animals without bones. This frog also eats insects and other animals with no bones and hard, jointed outsides. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
