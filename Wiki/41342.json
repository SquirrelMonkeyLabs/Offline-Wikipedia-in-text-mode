 "text": "An arc is a part of a circle. An arc is a curved line. The curve of an arc is constant and does not change (that is, an arc has constant curvature). It sometimes is portrayed as a dotted line. In a circle, the arc from point A to point B is written as \\overset{\\frown}{AB}. We call the length of an arc an arc length. For an arc on a circle with radius r subtended by an angle \\theta, its arc length is precisely r\\theta. == Related pages == * Arcsecond * Meridian arc == References == category:Geometry",
