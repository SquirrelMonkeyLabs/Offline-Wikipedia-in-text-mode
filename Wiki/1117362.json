 "text": "Fish balls are snacks made from fish paste, which is then either boiled or deep-fried. These are popular across various regions and cuisines. == Ingredients and preparation == Fish balls are typically made from fish mince or surimi (a processed fish paste). Other ingredients include salt and a culinary binder like tapioca flour, corn, or potato starch. The mixture is shaped into small balls and either boiled or fried. == Regional variations == Asia: Fish balls are enjoyed as snacks or added to soups and hotpot dishes. * In Hong Kong and the Philippines, they tend to be firmer, darker, and have a stronger fishy taste. * Taiwanese fish balls are bouncier and absorb soups and sauces well. Europe: European versions are less processed and may use milk or potatoes for binding. * Nordic countries like Norway, Denmark, and Sweden each have their own variations. == Production process == Fish are shredded, ground, or pounded. The mixture is mixed with salt, crushed ice, and other ingredients until smooth. The resulting texture is “bouncy” and ideal for soaking up flavors. Commercial production involves shaping the balls using an extruding machine, followed by boiling or frying. == Culinary influence == Fish balls are often associated with Chinese cuisine, and the industry is largely operated by people of Chinese descent. They add value to lower-priced fish economically. Category:Chinese food Category:Fish dishes",
