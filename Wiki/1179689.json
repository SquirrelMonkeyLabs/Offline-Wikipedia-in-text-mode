He has worked and lived primarily in Bristol and Kent, and now, when not traveling for work, lives in rural Somerset. His global travels have not been limited to fishing. He has had a variety of jobs in remote destinations and many setbacks due to the political instability and poor personal safety in some of these places. He has contracted malaria several times and came very close to dying from the disease in a village in the Congo, next to the river of the same name. He was also threatened at gunpoint and survived a plane crash. Wade has been arrested on several occasions on suspicion of espionage. == References == Category:1956 births Category:English writers Category:Writers from Suffolk Category:Living people",
