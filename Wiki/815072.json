 "text": "Combat sports such as boxing are done in rounds. Since about 1965, there are usually young women, who hold up the number of the next round, after one round finished. These women are called ring girls. Very often, ring girls wear a bathing suit or a bikini. They are also meant to entertain the spectators in the pause when there is no combat. They are similar to pit babes, which take this function in motor racing. Category:Boxing Category:Martial arts Category:Professional wrestling Category:Entertainment occupations",
