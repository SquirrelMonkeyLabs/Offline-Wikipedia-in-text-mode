 "text": "The Yucatán Peninsula is a peninsula in North America. It separates the Caribbean Sea from the Gulf of Mexico. The peninsula is east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a northwestern geographic divider, separating Central America from the rest of North America. Before the conquistadores came, the peninsula was the home of the Mayan civilization. The peninsula includes the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche, and Quintana Roo; the northern part of Belize; and Guatemala's northern department of El Petén. Mexican states on the isthmus to the south and west of the peninsula include Chiapas and Tabasco. The Chicxulub crater is on the north coast. It is believed to be made by the impact that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.
