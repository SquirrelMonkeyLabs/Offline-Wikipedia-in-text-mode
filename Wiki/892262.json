He started his college career as a backup quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes, before transferring to Louisiana State University (LSU). During his senior year at LSU, he passed for over 5,600 yards and 60 touchdowns, and was awarded the Heisman Trophy. He also led the Tigers to an undefeated season and College Football National Championship. After college, he was drafted first overall by the Bengals in 2020. He led the Bengals to an appearance in Super Bowl LVI. ==Early life== Joseph Lee Burrow was born in Ames, Iowa on December 10, 1996, the son of Robin and Jim Burrow. Jim is a former football player and coach whose career lasted over 40 years. Burrow was born in Ames when his father was on the staff for the Iowa State Cyclones. Joe's family is notably involved in sports. According to a 2019 Sports Illustrated story, \"the Burrow athletic lineage dates back nearly a century.\" From 2011–2014, Burrow attended Athens High School in The Plains, Ohio, leading the school to three straight playoff appearances and the school's first seven playoff victories in school history. During his high school career, he passed for 11,416 yards and 157 touchdowns, while also rushing for 2,067 yards with 27 rushing touchdowns. He was awarded the state's Mr. Football Award and Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in 2014. He and his Bulldog teammates went 14–1 that season. During high school, Burrow also played basketball at a high level and was named first-team all-state at point guard his senior year. Burrow was rated as a four-star football recruit, and was the eighth-highest ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2015 according to the 247SportsmComposite. On May 27, 2014, he committed to Ohio State University to play football for the Buckeyes. ==College career== ===Ohio State (2015–2017)=== Joe Burrow played college football at Ohio State University for the Buckeyes. He was a redshirt freshman in 2015, meaning he did not play his first year of college. He was then a backup to J. T. Barrett for the next two years. During that time, he played in 10 games, completing 29-of-39 pass attempts for 287 yards and two touchdowns. Dwayne Haskins was then named the starting quarterback for the Buckeyes. Because of this, Burrow decided to transfer to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play for the Tigers. Burrow graduated from Ohio State in three years with a degree in consumer and family financial services, and would be immediately eligible as a graduate transfer. ===LSU (2018–2019)=== In his first year as a Tiger, in 2018, Burrow was named the starter as a redshirt junior. He earned 2 SEC Player of the Week honors during the season. The Tigers finished the season with a 10–3 record. Burrow has 2,894 passing yards and 16 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions. While rushing the football, Burrow had 399 yards and 7 touchdowns. The following season, Burrow had what many sportswriters and football experts described as the best season by a college quarterback. In a blowout win against Texas A&M;, Burrow set the single-season Southeastern Conference (SEC) record in passing yards and tied the single-season record for passing touchdowns. The following week, Burrow led the Tigers to a 37–10 win in the SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, securing the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff. He was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP) and during the win, Burrow set the single-season SEC record for passing touchdowns. Later, on December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, winning the award by a record- margin of votes. In the playoff semifinal game at the 2019 Peach Bowl, Burrow led the Tigers to a 63–28 win over the fourth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. In the win, Burrow completed 29-of-39 pass attempts for 493 passing yards and seven passing touchdowns, to go along with five rushes for 22 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. Burrow's eight total touchdowns were an FBS bowl game record and SEC single game record, and were recorded in just over one half of play before Burrow was rested. Analysts have called Burrow's performance one of the greatest in college football history. In the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw for 463 yards and five passing touchdowns. Burrow also ran for a touchdown in the game and was named the game's offensive MVP, as he led LSU to a 42–25 victory. With the win, LSU finished with an undefeated 15–0 season. He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which set the single-season NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) record. Burrow's record has since been passed by Bailey Zappe of Western Kentucky, who threw for 62 touchdowns in 2021. Burrow also set a new FBS single-season record in combined passing and rushing touchdowns, with 65. Zappe tied this record in 2021. Burrow also finished the year with 5,671 passing yards, which is tied for fourth all-time in an FBS season. His passer rating of 202 for the season was also a record until it was passed by Mac Jones in 2020. ===Statistics=== Legend CFP National Champion Former NCAA record Led the NCAA Bold Career high Year Team Games Passing Rushing 2015 Ohio State 0 0 – Redshirt 2016 Ohio State 5 0 – 22 28 78.6 226 2 0 169.9 12 58 4.8 1 2017 Ohio State 5 0 – 7 11 63.6 61 0 0 110.2 3 −5 −1.7 0 2018 LSU 13 13 10–3 219 379 57.8 2,894 16 5 133.2 128 399 3.1 7 2019 LSU 15 15 15–0 402 527 76.3 5,671 60 6 202.0 115 368 3.2 5 Career 38 28 25–3 650 945 68.8 8,852 78 11 172.4 258 820 3.2 13 ==Professional career== ===Cincinnati Bengals (2020–present)=== ====Pre-Draft==== After his first year at LSU, Burrow was not expected to be a first-round NFL Draft pick. However, after his senior season, Burrow became the heavy favorite to be picked first overall. A Draft Network analysis of Burrow's skill set before the draft complimented Burrow for his \"elite football intelligence,\" but stated Burrow doesn't have \"elite arm strength and throwing power.\" Their final evaluation stated: :: > Coming off the greatest season in SEC quarterback history, Joe Burrow > features a high-level skill set with the makeup of being a dynamic franchise > quarterback.
