The incumbent Governor is Reiner Haseloff of the CDU, governing with the SPD. ==Results== *30 CDU MPs were elected (down 12) - 29.8% *24 AfD MPs were elected (up 24) - 24.2% *17 The Left MPs were elected (down 9) - 16.3% *11 SPD MPs were elected (down 17) - 10.6% *5 Green MPs were elected (down 4) - 5.2% ==Post-election== The only realistic possibility would be a coalition government of the CDU, SPD and the Greens. Together, they would have a 2-seat majority . Other combinations (such as the CDU and The Left or CDU and AfD) are highly unlikely. The stark differences among the parties will make it harder for negotiations to create a coalition. ==Polls before the election== The reference for the polls is wahlrecht.de.
