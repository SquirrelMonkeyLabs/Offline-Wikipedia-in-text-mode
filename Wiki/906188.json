 "text": "Izecksohn's tree frog (Bokermannohyla izeckshoni) is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives on the Atlantic side (east) of the country. The adult frog can grow as large as 5.1 cm from nose to rear end. It is light brown in color with a mottling pattern on its back. It has yellow color on its sides. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs in pools of water that dry up for part of the year. Because the male frogs have no vocal sacs, scientists thing the frogs do not have voices. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives. Human beings cut down forests for wood, farms, or places for cows and other animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
