 "text": "Led Zeppelin was an English rock band. The group was started in 1968 and broke up in 1980. The members were Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (lead guitar), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drums). Led Zeppelin ended in 1980 after the accidental death of John Bonham. After Bonham's death, the band believed that nobody could take his place and decided not to continue. The band played together again in a tribute concert in London on 10 December 2007 with Jason Bonham, John's son, playing the drums. The band is one of the most influential rock bands of all time and one of the most successful music artists in history, selling 300 million albums around the world. ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Led Zeppelin (1969) *Led Zeppelin II (1969) *Led Zeppelin III (1970) *Led Zeppelin IV (1971) *Houses of the Holy (1973) *Physical Graffiti (1975) *Presence (1976) *In Through the Out Door (1979) ;Filmography *The Song Remains the Same (1976) *Led Zeppelin (DVD) (2003) *Mothership (DVD) (2007) ==Other websites== * Led Zeppelin: Official Site * Led Zeppelin at MySpace * Rock and Roll Hall of Fame bio * Rolling Stone Magazine bio * BBC interview with Robert Plant about the Led Zeppelin reunion * 1971 interview with Led Zeppelin * Heart-Led Zeppelin Stairway to heaven- kennedy center honors Category:1968 establishments in England Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1980 Category:1960s British music groups Category:1970s British music groups Category:1980s British music groups Category:English hard rock bands Category:English heavy metal bands Category:Kennedy Center honorees Category:Musical groups established in 1968 Category:Musical groups from London Category:1980s disestablishments in England Category:1980 disestablishments in the United Kingdom",
