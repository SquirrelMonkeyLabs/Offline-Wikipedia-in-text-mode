They can have air forced over a set of wires or an infrared element that will heat objects in the room. * Oil-filled convection heaters: heat rooms through convection. The inside is filled with oil that is heated by a heating element. This heat then escapes the heater and heats objects in the room. * Gas heater: heat a room by burning some form of natural gas, propane, or kerosene.
