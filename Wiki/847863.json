 "text": "The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup was the twentieth edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup. The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup took place for the first time in New Zealand. == Host selection == Four FIFA member associations officially submitted their bids to host the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup by the deadline of 11 February 2011. On 3 March 2011, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held for the first time in New Zealand. This is the third FIFA competition staged in this country, after the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship and the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. ; Bidding member associations * New Zealand * Peru * Tunisia * Wales == Venues == Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington and Whangarei were the 7 cities chosen to host the competition. Before the stadium announcements were made, Dunedin City council suggested in January 2013, that it would not bid to host matches at Forsyth Barr Stadium (also known as Otago Stadium) unless the costs (an estimated $1m) could be lowered. The stadium hosted seven matches there, the last of which being a Round of 16 game.

Teams that made their debut. : 2. Serbia made their first U-20 World Cup appearance as an independent nation. They were chosen as the descendant of the now-defunct Yugoslavia, which qualified in 1979 and 1987. == Draw and schedule == The final draw was held on 10 February 2015, 17:30 local time, at the SkyCity Grand, Auckland. For the draw, the 24 teams were divided into four seeding pots: * Pot 1: Hosts and continental champions of five confederations (except OFC) * Pot 2: Remaining teams from AFC and CAF * Pot 3: Remaining teams from CONCACAF and CONMEBOL * Pot 4: Remaining teams from OFC and UEFA As a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage. As the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place on 23 March 2015 in Dakar, Senegal, at the tournament's conclusion to determine the groups where the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed CAF teams would play in, to ensure there was no manipulation of games in the qualifying tournament ensuring fairness to all qualified teams. Pot 1 Pot 2 Pot 3 Pot 4 The schedule of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013. == Match officials == A total of 21 referees, 6 support referees, and 42 assistant referees were selected for the tournament.

Each participating national association had to submit a final list of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) at least 10 days before the tournament started. These players were shortlisted from a provisional list of 35 players, including a minimum of four goalkeepers. All players must have been born on or after 1 January 1995. If a player listed in the final squad suffered a serious injury up until 24 hours before the kick- off of his team's first match, he could be replaced by a player from the provisional list with the approval of FIFA's medical and organising committees. In July 2015, it was reported that the New Zealand squad had included an ineligible player, South African Deklan Wynne not having completed the requisite period of residence in New Zealand. ==Group stage== The winners and runners-up of each group and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16. The rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows: If two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows: All times are local, New Zealand Standard Time (UTC+12). ===Group A=== \\---- \\---- ===Group B=== \\---- \\---- ===Group C=== \\---- \\---- ===Group D=== \\---- \\---- ===Group E=== \\---- \\---- ===Group F=== \\---- \\---- ===Ranking of third-placed teams=== The four best ranked third-placed teams also advanced to the round of 16.
