Qum: Ansariyan Publications. 2004. p. 117. He was the son of Ali ibn Husayn or Zayn al-Abidin and the first imam who descended from both grandsons of Muhammad, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali. He is highly respected by both Sunni and Shia Muslims for his leadership, knowledge and Islamic scholarship as a jurist in Medina. After the death of Ali ibn Husayn (the fourth Imam), most of the Shiites agreed upon his son al-Baqir as the next imam; some of them said that, another son of the imam Zayd ibn Ali should be the next imam, and became to be known as Zaidiyyah.Regional Surveys of the World: The Middle East and North Africa 2003.
