He was the leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister of Australia. He was Minister for Communications in the government of Australia under Prime Minister Tony Abbott from 18 September 2013 until 14 September 2015. Turnbull is also the former Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Parliament, and former leader of the Liberal Party, succeeding Brendan Nelson on 16 September 2008. He lost the leadership positions on 1 December 2009, by one vote to Tony Abbott. Turnbull had agreed to allow the government's emissions trading scheme (ETS) to pass through the parliament. This was opposed by many people in the Liberal Party who argued that an ETS was unnecessary. Other people in the party thought an ETS would harm Australia's coal exports. Others in the party did not like the way that Turnbull managed the arguments within his party. Turnbull was elected in his full-term Prime Minister position in the 2016 federal election. He resigned in August 2018 following a leadership challenge in the Liberal Party where Scott Morrison was elected as the party's leader and eventual Prime Minister. == References == Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Australian Roman Catholics Category:Australian lawyers Category:Leaders of the Opposition (Australia) Category:Liberal Party of Australia politicians Category:Politicians from Sydney Category:Prime ministers of Australia Category:Republicans",
