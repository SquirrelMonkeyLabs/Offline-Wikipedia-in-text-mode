 "text": "The Nodosauridae is a family of ankylosaur dinosaurs, from Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous strata of what are now North America, Asia, Antarctica and Europe. They are the family of ankylosaurs which do not have club-shaped tails. They often have spikes protecting their head and shoulders. All nodosaurs, like other ankylosaurs, are medium-sized to large, heavily built quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaurs, with small denticulate teeth and rows of osteoderms (a type of armour) on the dorsolateral (top and sides) surfaces of the body. ==Classification== ===Taxonomy=== The following taxonomy follows Thompson et al., 2011 unless otherwise noted. * Family Nodosauridae ** ?Aletopelta (California, Western North America) ** Animantarx (Utah, Western North America) ** Anoplosaurus (England, Northwestern Europe) ** Antarctopelta (James Ross Island, Northeastern Antarctic Peninsula) ** Edmontonia (Alberta, Western North America) ** Gargoyleosaurus (Wyoming, Western North America) ** Gastonia (Utah, Western North America) ** Glyptodontopelta (New Mexico, Western North America) ** Hoplitosaurus (South Dakota, central North America) ** Hungarosaurus (Hungary, Central-Southern Europe) ** Hylaeosaurus (Sussex, Southern England) ** Mymoorapelta (Colorado, central North America) ** Niobrarasaurus (Kansas, Western North America) ** Nodosaurus (Wyoming and Kansas, Western North America) ** Panoplosaurus (Montana and Alberta, Western North America) ** Pawpawsaurus (Texas, Western North America) ** Peloroplites (Utah, Western North America) ** Polacanthus (Isle of Wight and Sussex, Southern England) ** Propanoplosaurus (Maryland, Eastern North America) ** Sauropelta (Wyoming and Montana, Western North America) ** Silvisaurus (Kansas, Western North America) ** Stegopelta (Wyoming, Western North America) ** Struthiosaurus (Central-Southern Europe) ** Tatankacephalus (Montana, Western North America) ** Texasetes (Texas, Western North America) ** Zhejiangosaurus (Zhejiang Province, Eastern China) * Doubtful Nodosaurids ** Acanthopholis (United Kingdom, Western Europe) ** Palaeoscincus ===Phylogeny=== The clade Nodosauridae may be defined as \"all ankylosaurs closer to Panoplosaurus than to Ankylosaurus. Vickaryous et al. considered the most primitive member of the Nodosauridae to be Cedarpelta.Vickaryous M.K; Maryanska T. and Weishampel D.B. 2004. Ankylosauria.
