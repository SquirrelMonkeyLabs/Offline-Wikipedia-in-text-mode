People see them about 4 m above the ground. This frog breeds in phytotelms. That means that it says eggs in holes in trees that have water in them. People have seen this frog 1210 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place, and human beings have changed it to make it harder for the frog to live there. People build roads and change forests into farms, especially to grow rubber, tea, and coffee. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
