 "text": "The Walls of Jerusalem National Park is located in the centre of Tasmania. The park has a size of about 518 kmÂ² and was founded June 1981. It has been part of the Tasmanian Wilderness UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982 and is on both the cultural and natural heritage lists. This is where King Davids Peak is located. == Meaning of the name == The park takes its name from geological formations that resemble the walls of the city of Jerusalem in Israel. Therefore, many places and formations in the park are named after places in the Bible like Herod's Gate, Salome Lake, Solomon's Jewels and Damascus Gate. == Tourism == Like much of the Tasmanian wilderness, the area is not very accessible by roads and the only road leading into the park is through the C171 road. It is only accessible to experienced hikers (bushwalkers) or skiers who, because of the often very changeable weather, have to be very careful and take appropriate precautionary measures, about which the Parks & Wildlife Service provides comprehensive information. == Nature == The national park is characterised above all by its alpine vegetation with endemic coniferous forests and upholstered heather stands. In fire-protected areas, stands of cypress-like scale spruce can be found. The landscape of the area is characterised by Ice Age moraines and glacier lakes. == Other websites == * Parks & Wildlife Service Tasmania == References == Category:Tasmanian Wilderness Category:National parks in Australia",
