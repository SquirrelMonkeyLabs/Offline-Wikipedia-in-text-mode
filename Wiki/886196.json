 "text": "The fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt as the 32nd president of the United States happened on January 20, 1945. It was the start of the fourth and final term of Franklin D. Roosevelt as president and the only term of Harry S. Truman as vice president. A public ceremony happened on the South Portico of the White House in Washington, D.C., instead of the United States Capitol. This was because of World War II. The inaugural parade and other events were canceled as well. The event was the 40th presidential inauguration. This was the one and only time that a president has ever been sworn in to a fourth term in office. After the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1951, this meant that no person could be elected more than twice as president. Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone administered the oath of office to Roosevelt. Henry A. Wallace administered the vice presidential oath of office to Truman. 82 days into his term, Roosevelt died, and Truman became the next president. ==References== ==Other websites== * Newsreel footage of Roosevelt's 1945 inauguration from C-SPAN (via YouTube) * Text of Roosevelt's Fourth Inaugural Address * Audio of Roosevelt's Fourth Inaugural Address Category:1945 in the United States Category:Franklin D.
