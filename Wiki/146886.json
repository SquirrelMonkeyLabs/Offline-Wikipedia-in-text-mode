 "text": "Nitric Acid (HNO3) is a very corrosive and toxic strong acid that can cause severe burns. It is also known as aqua fortis. The majority of nitric acid is used to make ammonium nitrate and other fertilizers. Some is used in rocket fuels and explosives, and to help make wood look older. It can react with metals such as copper to produce a brown toxic gas called nitrogen dioxide. It is made by reaction of nitrogen dioxide with water. In alchemy, it is known as aqua fortis, or strong water. It can dissolve silver but leaves gold unharmed, making it a good test for gold. The term acid test came from this test.
