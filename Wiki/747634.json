The season's executive producer was series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who also functioned as the series' showrunner. During production of the previous season, Nickelodeon picked up a second season for SpongeBob SquarePants on August 31, 1999. The season premiered more than a year later, on October 20, 2000. Season production assistant Derek Iversen commented, \"We hoped it would go one season. We hoped it would go two seasons. I figured you do the best you can and you hope.\" In this season, production switched from cel animation, used during the first season, to digital ink and paint. Executive producer Paul Tibbitt, in 2009, said \"The first season of SpongeBob was done the old-fashioned way on cells, and every cell had to be part- painted, left to dry, paint some other colours. ==Cast== The second season featured Tom Kenny as the voice of the title character SpongeBob SquarePants and his pet snail Gary. ==Episodes== ==Notes== ==References== Category:SpongeBob SquarePants seasons Category:2000 television seasons Category:2001 television seasons",
