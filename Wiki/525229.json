Then it became Glassboro State College in 1958. Starting in the 1970s, it added programs in business, communications, and engineering. It was renamed Rowan College of New Jersey in 1992, after Henry Rowan and his wife Betty gave the school $100 million. At the time, the gift was largest ever given to a public college.Gurney, Kaitlin. \"10 years later, Rowan still reaps gift's rewards - Rowan Milestones\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, July 9, 2002.
