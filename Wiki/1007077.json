 "text": "The Union Canal, full name the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal, is a canal in Scotland. It goes from Falkirk to Edinburgh. It was made to bring minerals, especially coal, to Edinburgh. It was opened in 1822 and was successful, but the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which opened in 1842 took the trade. It declined and was closed to commercial traffic in 1933. It was officially closed in 1965. It was reopened in 2001 and reconnected to the Forth and Clyde Canal in 2002 by the Falkirk Wheel. It is now in popular use for pleasure boats. ==References== Category:Canals in Scotland",
