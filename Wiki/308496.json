 "text": "The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth from the Pleistocene period until its death in the Holocene epoch. They were large elephants which lived during the ice ages. The animal is known from bones and frozen carcasses from northern North America and northern Eurasia. The best-preserved carcasses (including Yuka) were found in Siberia. These mammoths are perhaps the most well known and most iconic species of mammoth. Woolly mammoths are now extinct, so we can't see them anymore. This mammoth species was first recorded in deposits of a former glaciation in Eurasia, perhaps 150,000 years ago.Lister A.M.; Sher A.V.; Van Essen H.; Wei G. 2005. The pattern and process of mammoth evolution in Eurasia. Quaternary International. 126–128: 49–64. Their closest living relatives are Asian elephants. Woolly mammoths coexisted with early humans, who hunted them, and their bones and tusks were used as tools, and dwellings. Mammoths were also hunted for food. The species disappeared from most of its range at the end of the Pleistocene (10,000 years ago), with a dwarfed race and small populations still living on Wrangel Island until about 1700 BC. Cave paintings of the woolly mammoth have been found in caves in France and Spain. == Description == === Height === Male mammoths can reach between 2.67 and 3.49 m (8 ft 9 in and 11 ft 5 in) and weigh between 3.9 and 8.2 t (3.8 and 8.1 long tons; 4.3 and 9.0 short tons). Females can reach 2.3–2.6 m (7 ft 7 in – 8 ft 6 in) in shoulder heights and weigh between 2.8–4 t (2.8–3.9 long tons; 3.1–4.4 short tons). A calf weighs about 90 kg (200 lb). === Coat === A woolly mammoth's coat could easily adapt to the chilly conditions during glacial periods. This coat was covered with thick fur to keep themselves warm in the cold weather. == Resurrection == Scientists are currently working to resurrect this mammoth. In 2003, the Pyrenean ibex (also called a bucardo) was temporarily resurrected, and the clone died several minutes after birth due to a lung defect, so this could mean woolly mammoths would be revived soon. == Notable specimens == === Yuka the mammoth === Yuka is a preserved woolly mammoth discovered by local Siberian tusk hunters in August 2010 and also had a broken hind leg, which likely occurred as it tried to escape and fell. === Lyuba the mammoth === Lyuba is another well-known mammoth. She was formerly the best preserved mammoth mummy in the world (now held by Yuka). === Yukagir Mammoth === The Yukagir Mammoth is a frozen adult male woolly mammoth discovered in 2002 in northern Yakutia and is considered a exceptional discovery. The specimen is named after the Siberian village of Yukagir near where it was found. == In popular culture == Woolly mammoths are popular creatures nowadays, appearing in many media, including movies. One notable example is the 2002 movie Ice Age, in which there is a mammoth named Manny, who is a major character. == Related pages == * Mastodon – a distantly related taxon to mammoths * Steppe mammoth * Mammuthus meridionalis * Columbian mammoth == References == == Other websites == * Natural History Museum: \"The last of the mammoths\" – three-minute video about the extinction of the woolly mammoth, presented by Adrian Lister * National Geographic: \"Mammoth tusk treasure hunt\" – two-minute video about mammoth tusk collecting in modern Siberia Category:Elephants Category:Extinct mammals Category:Mammals of North America Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Mammals of Europe Category:Proboscideans",
