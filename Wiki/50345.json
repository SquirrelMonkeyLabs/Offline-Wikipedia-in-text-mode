 "text": "Chytridiomycota is a phylum of the Fungi kingdom. The name comes from chytridium (from the Greek chytridion, meaning \"little pot\"): the structure containing unreleased spores. The chytrids are the most primitive of the fungi. Many chytrids are found in fresh water. There are approximately 1,000 chytrid species, in 127 genera, distributed among 5 orders. Chytrids get their energy mostly from non-living organic matter.That means they are saprobic. They degrade chitin and keratin). Both zoospores and gametes of the chytrids are mobile by their flagella, one whiplash per individual. Some chytrid species are known to kill amphibians in large numbers. The actual process, however, is unknown. ==References== == Other websites == * Chytrid Fungi Online : by the University of Alabama * Impact of chytrid fungus on frogs (Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife) * 'Amphibian Ark' aims to save frogs from fungus. .
