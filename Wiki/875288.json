 "text": "\"Family Guy Viewer Mail #2\" is the 22nd episode of Family Guys 10th season. It was broadcast on Fox on May 20, 2012. The next episode (\"Internal Affairs\") was broadcast right after this episode. The episode is in three parts: \"Chap of the Manor\", \"Fatman and Robin\", and \"Point of Stew\". The episode is based on an episode from the 3rd season, \"Family Guy Viewer Mail #1\". About 5.35 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. BBC Three broadcasted the episode on August 11, 2014 in the United Kingdom. In the \"Fatman and Robin\" story, Peter Griffin is able to make everything he touches become Robin Williams. Peter later starts panicking because of this and tries to kill himself. This broadcast happened minutes before people knew Robin Williams had killed himself on the same day. People on Twitter and Reddit talked about how the episode was broadcast right before Robin Williams died. BBC Three broadcasted the episode at 11:25 pm. People learned about Robin Williams' death around 11:50 pm. A spokeswoman for BBC said that this was a strange coincidence. The episode was chosen to be broadcast on that day more than two weeks before. It would have been broadcast again four days later if this did not happen. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Family Guy episodes Category:2012 television episodes",
