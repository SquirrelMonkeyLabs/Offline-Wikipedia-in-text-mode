 "text": "The Thotsakan Kid Game () is a Thai game show produced by Workpoint Entertainment. It was started in 2004 and ended in 2008. Children play on their own rather than against each other. They have to match the correct face with a given name. The player will receive a scholarship worth up to one million baht. The game will go on until a wrong answer is given. A later format change, perhaps due to the controversy (see below), saw teams of three different ages, and then single players, playing for charity in a similar format to the Southern Teachers version, before the kids' edition was discontinued altogether in June 2008, which, combined with the renaming of Yok Siam (above), meant an end to the Tod Sa Gun name after just over 5 years. ==History== Children play on their own rather than against each other.
