 "text": "A micro bikini (or microkini) is a bikini, a bathing suit for women. Like a bikini, it is made of two parts, a top, and a slip. The slip usually only covers the labiae, the top only covers the nipples. Microkinis were developed in the 1970s, because nudism was outlawed in many parts of the United States. Many microkini models are transparent. They usually do not cover the buttocks. There are versions which are just made of straps of fabric which cover almost nothing. Before wearing a micro bikini, women usually shave at least part of their pubic hair. Pasties can be seen as a variant of a microkini: Unlike a top, which is made of fabric, pasties are made of plastic; they are not kept in place with cords. Microkini designs for men were introduced at the end of the 1960s consisting of briefs that barely covered the penis and the pubic hair. These micro bikinis for men have continued to be popular in Brazil, particularly in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. During the 1980s the popularity of highly revealing thongs such as those found in the microkini meant that Brazilian waxing to remove most of the hair from the pubic area also became more poular. In 1995 fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld created a micro bikini for Chanel’s spring 1996 collection. It resembled a string bikini except that the top's triangles were replaced with two small circles resembling nipple pasties. Microkinis keep the wearer just within legal limits of decency. They fill a niche between nudism and conservative swimwear. In Europe the wearing of microkinis at beaches or hotels or public pools is often allowed.Mistrík, Erich, Pseudo-Concrete Ideals Of A Good Life, Human Affairs (2/2008), Department of Social & Biological Communication, Slovenská Akadémia Vied, Slovakia It may be considered inappropriate in more conservative societies. Wearing them in public is prohibited in some places by local laws which can carry a fine. == References == Category:Swimwear",
