 "text": "Holt, Renfrew & Co., Limited is a Canadian chain of luxury department stores. They have headquarters in Brampton, Ontario. They have 6 store locations in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec. In 1837, William S. Henderson created what became Holt Renfrew after buying his partner's fur store. He then began to grow the store and called it William Ashton & Co., later renaming it to William S. Henderson & Co. in 1847. William's brother John later became owner of the store and it went through many names including John Henderson & Co., Henderson, Renfrew & Co., Renfrew & Marcou, and G.R. Renfrew & Co. The business became popular and they supplied fur to John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. They later became the \"Furriers in Ordinary\" for Her Majesty Queen Victoria and many other members of the British royal family. After World War II, Holt Renfrew grew to become the top furrier in Canada and kept a close relationship with the British royal family by providing the official wedding gift for Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip in 1947. They also started relationships with different fashion brands like the House of Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. In April 1986, Wittington Investments Limited bought Holy Renfrew from its former Los Angeles-based owner Broadway- Hale. They then made Michael Brickell the company president, Galen Weston as chairman and his wife Hilary M. Weston as the vice-chairman. The board changed many time afterwards. == References == ==Other website== * Category:19th- century establishments in Canada Category:1830s establishments in North America Category:Companies based in Toronto Category:Department stores of Canada",
