In the painting, Jesus's disciples react after Jesus says that one of them would betray him. The painting shows the unique reaction of each disciple. It is a very large tempera painting on the wall of the Refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, MilanSanta Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It measures 4.6 meters (15 feet) x 8.8 meters (28.9 feet). Leonardo began painting it in 1495 and finished it in 1498, but did not work on it all the time between these years. He used experimental techniques to create the mural. The Last Supper has been called \"perhaps the most important mural painting in the world.\" Some people think the painting has secret messages. ==References== Category:Paintings with Christian themes Category:Paintings by Leonardo da Vinci Category:15th-century paintings",
