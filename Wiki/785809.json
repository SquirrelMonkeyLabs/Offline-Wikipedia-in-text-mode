The shooting happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23, 2020, as officers were attempting to arrest Blake. There was an arrest warrant against Blake for criminal trespass, domestic abuse, and sexual assault. During the encounter, Blake was tasered and scuffled with officers. He was shot as he opened the driver's door to his SUV and leaned in. Three of Blake's sons were in the backseat. The shooting was followed by protests, property damage, arson, and shooting deaths in downtown Kenosha. Both the state of Wisconsin and the U.S. federal government decided not to charge police officer Rusten Sheskey with a crime for the shooting. ==References== Category:2020 in Wisconsin Category:August 2020 events",
