 "text": "Hyde Park is a community area on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. It is located on the shore of Lake Michigan seven miles (11 km) south of the Chicago Loop. Hyde Park is home to the University of Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry, and two of Chicago's four historic sites listed in the original 1966 National Register of Historic Places (Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, and Robie House). In the early 21st century, Hyde Park received national attention for its association with U.S. President Barack Obama, who before running for president, was a professor of law at the University of Chicago. ==References== Category:Community areas of Chicago",
