 "text": "This is a list of the world's best-selling albums. The criteria are that the figure must have been published by a reliable source and the album must have sold at least 20 million copies worldwide. Most albums have different estimates of sales. In this list, the highest sales reported for an album is added to the list. Groupings are based on different sales benchmarks. The highest benchmark is for claims of at least 100 million copies, and the lowest are for claims of 20–29 million copies. Albums are listed in order of number of copies sold and by the artist's first name. This list contains all types of albums, including studio, greatest hits, compilation, various artists, soundtrack and remix. A number of issues make exact figures difficult to calculate, as historical data before the 1980s and from developing countries is incomplete. Also, fans, record companies and the media are prone to making the sales figures higher than they actually are to boost the image of the act. The list also does not take into account the resale of used albums or as the emergence of illegal downloading of digital music. Michael Jackson's Thriller is the best selling album of all time. The album is cited as selling as many as 110 million copies worldwide. ==Legend== Colors Studio Albums Greatest Hits & Compilations Soundtracks ==Over 50 million copies== Artist Album Released Genre Sales (millions) Source Michael Jackson Thriller 1982 Pop / R&B; / Rock 130 | Himesh Reshammiya Aap Kaa Surroor 2006 Indipop 55 ==40–49 million copies== Artist Album Released Genre Sales (millions) Source Pink Floyd The Dark Side of the Moon 1973 Progressive rock 50 AC/DC Back in Black 1980 Hard rock / Heavy metal 49 Whitney Houston / Various artists The Bodyguard 1992 Soundtrack 44 Meat Loaf Bat Out of Hell 1977 Rock 43 Eagles Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975) 1976 Rock 42 Various artists Dirty Dancing 1987 Dance / Pop 42 Backstreet Boys Millennium 1999 Pop 40 Bee Gees / Various artists Saturday Night Fever 1977 Disco 40 Fleetwood Mac Rumours 1977 Rock 40 ==30–39 million copies== Artist Album Released Genre Sales (millions) Source Michael Jackson Bad 1987 Pop / R&B; 39 Shania Twain Come On Over 1997 Country / Pop 40 Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin IV 1971 Hard rock / Heavy metal 37 Alanis Morissette Jagged Little Pill 1995 Rock 33 Michael Jackson Dangerous 1991 Pop / R&B; / New jack swing 32 The Beatles Sgt.
