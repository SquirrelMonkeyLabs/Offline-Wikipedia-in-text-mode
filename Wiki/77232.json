 "text": "Tom and Jerry Kids Show is a 1990-1993 television series by Hanna-Barbera Studios and Turner Entertainment. This follows Tom and Jerry as kids in their cat-and-mouse games. The show also contains segments featuring Droopy and his son Dripple (who would later star in their own short-lived spin-off, \"Droopy, Master Detective\"), Spike & Tyke (from the original Tom & Jerry) and Blast-Off Buzzard (from \"The CB Bears\"). The original run lasted until 1994 when the show was canceled. In certain countries, the Tom & Jerry Kids shorts have aired separately on Boomerang until 2014. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (1990)=== # Flippin' Fido # Dakota Droopy & the Lost Dutch Boy Mine (Droopy & Dripple) # Dog Daze Afternoon # Toys Will Be Toys # Droopy Delivers (Droopy & Dripple) # My Pal # Prehistoric Pals # Super Droop & Dripple Boy Meet the Yolker (Droopy & Dripple) # Marvelous Marvin # Bat Mouse # Puss 'n Pups (Spike & Tyke) # Outer Space Rover # The Vermin # Aerobic Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Mouse Scouts # Sugar Belle Loves Tom, Sometimes # Super Duper Spike (Spike & Tyke) # Mall Mouse # Cosmic Chaos # Droopy of the Opera (Droopy & Dripple) # Beach Bummers # Gator, Baiter # Hoodwinked Cat (Spike & Tyke) # Medieval Mouse # Clyde to the Rescue # Droopio & Juliet (Droopy & Dripple) # Maze Monster Zap Men # Crash Condor # Yo Ho Ho… Bub (Droopy & Dripple) # Scrub-a-Dub Tom # No Biz Like a Snow Biz # The Maltese Poodle (Droopy & Dripple) # Cast Away Tom # The Little Urfulls # Droopo: The First Bloodhound (Droopy & Dripple) # Indy Mouse 500 # Exterminator Cometh # Foreign Legion Frenzy (Droopy & Dripple) # Urfo Returns ===Season 2 (1991)=== # Circus Antics # Trés Sheik Poodles (Droopy & Dripple) # Head Banger Buddy # Pump 'Em Up Pals # DroopyLand (Droopy & Dripple) # The Exterminator Cometh… Again # Jerry's Mother # Stage Fright (Droopy & Dripple) # Tom's Terror # Who are you Kitten? # Broadway Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Pussycat Pirate # Father's Day # Scourge of the Sky (Droopy & Dripple) # Lightning Bolt the Super Squirrel # Amademouse # Muscle Beach Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # \"Perky\" the Fish Pinching Penguin # Slowpoke Antonio # Haunted Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Wildmouse # Catch That Mouse # Good Knight Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Birthday Surprise # Cleocatra # McWolfenstein (Droopy & Dripple) # Chase School # Zorrito # Deep Sleep Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Hard to Swallow # The Little Thinker (Urfo & Buzz) # Rap Rat is Where It's At (Droopy & Dripple) # My Pet (Spike & Tyke) # Calaboose Cal 495 # Return of the Chubby Man (Droopy & Dripple) # Chumpy Chums # Jerry Hood and his Merry Meeces # Eradicator Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Tyke on a Hike (Spike & Tyke) ===Season 3 (1992)=== # The Planet Dogmania # McWolfula (Droopy & Dripple) # Catawumpus Cat # Pest in the West # Double 'O' Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Tom, the Babysitter # Gas Blaster Puss # Fear of Flying (Droopy & Dripple) # Mess Hall Mouser # Toliver's Twist # Boomer Beaver (Spike & Tyke) # Pony Express Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Krazy Klaws # Tyke on a Bike (Spike & Tyke) # Tarmutt of the Apes (Droopy & Dripple) # Tom's Mermouse Mess-Up # Here's Sand in Your Face (Spike & Tyke) # Deep Space Droopy (Droopy & Dripple) # Termi-Maid # The Fish That Shoulda Got Away (Spike & Tyke) # Droopy's Rhino (Droopy & Dripple) # The Break 'n' Entry Boyz # Love Me, Love My Zebra (Spike & Tyke) # Dakota Droopy Returns (Droopy & Dripple) # Doom Manor # Barbecue Bust-Up (Spike & Tyke) # The Fabulous Droopy & Dripple (Droopy & Dripple) # S.O.S.
