 "text": "Famous is a hip-hop song by American rapper Kanye West. It is the lead single in his seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo. The song also features vocals from Barbadian singer Rihanna. The song also includes a modified sample of the hit-single “Bam Bam” by Jamaican reggae artist Sister Nancy. This song has been a part of the Kanye West-Taylor Swift feud, as it contains these lyrics that insult American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift because of West's interruption of Swift's 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the aftermath: > For all my South Side niggas that know me best > I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex > Why? I made that bitch famous > (Goddamn!) > I made that bitch famous. > ==References== Category:2016 songs Category:Kanye West songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Diss tracks",
