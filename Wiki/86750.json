 "text": "Lodging or holiday accommodation is a type of accommodation. People who travel and stay away from home for more than a day need lodging mainly for sleeping. Other purposes are safety, shelter from cold and rain, and to have a place to store luggage and being able to take a shower. They do that in a hotel, hostel or hostal, a private home (for example, a bed and breakfast or guest house place), in a tent, or a caravan/camper (often on a campsite). Lodging may also refer to when cereal crops fall over, often due to wind or rain pressure, making grain harvest difficult. ==Related pages== * Homelessness * Hostel * Tourism ==Other websites== * Simply translated accommodation portal available in 14 languages: Residenzo * The Lodging Wiki at Hospitality-411 * World Lodging Guide *VEHICALL, a worldwide free service for holiday rentals == References == Category:Travel",
