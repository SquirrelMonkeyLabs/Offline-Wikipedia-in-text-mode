 "text": "The constellation Norma is a small group of stars in the southern hemisphere between Scorpius and Centaurus. Its name is Latin for normal and can mean a right angle. The constellation may be pictured as a ruler, a carpenter's square, a set square, or a level. ==Notable features== ===Stars=== The Milky Way passes through Norma. ===Deep-sky objects=== Because it is on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep sky objects.
