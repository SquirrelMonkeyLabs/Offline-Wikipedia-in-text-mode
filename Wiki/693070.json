At the age of 14, she changed her name to Zadie. Smith's mother grew up in Jamaica, and emigrated to England in 1969. Smith's parents divorced when she was a teenager. She has a half-sister, a half-brother, and two younger brothers (one is the rapper and stand-up comedian Doc Brown, and the other is the rapper Luc Skyz). As a child, Smith liked tap dancing. As a teenager, she considered a career in musical theatre. When she was a university student, Smith earned money as a jazz singer. She also wanted to become a journalist. Despite earlier ambitions, literature became her main interest. ==Education== Smith attended the local state schools, Malorees Junior School and Hampstead Comprehensive School. She then studied English literature atKing's College, Cambridge. She did not leave Cambridge with a double First. She got a Third on her Part Ones.Stephanie Merritt, \"She's young, black, British – and the first publishing sensation of the millennium\", The Observer, 16 January 2000. The popular British comedy double act Mitchell and Webb may have rejected Smith from the Cambridge Footlights in the 1990s. At Cambridge, Smith published a number of short stories in a collection of new student writing called The Mays Anthology. A publisher liked the stories and offered her a contract for her first novel. Smith contacted a literary agent, and A. P. Watt represented her. Smith returned to guest-edit the anthology in 2001. ==Career== Smith's first novel White Teeth was introduced to the publishing world in 1997, before it was completed. Publishers saw part of the manuscript and an auction for the rights started. Hamish Hamilton won. Smith completed White Teeth during her final year at Cambridge. It was published in 2000. The novel immediately became a best-seller. It was praised internationally and won awards, including: the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the Betty Trask Award. The novel was adapted for television in 2002. Smith was writer-in-residence at the ICA in London and later published, as editor, an anthology of sex writing, Piece of Flesh, as the main work of this job. In interviews, Smith reported that all the attention around her first novel had caused her to suffer briefly from writer's block. But, her second novel, The Autograph Man, was published in 2002 and was a commercial success. Critics did not like it as much as White Teeth. After the publication of The Autograph Man, Smith visited the United States as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.2002–2003 Radcliffe Institute Fellows Smith's third novel, On Beauty, was published in September 2005.

Also in 2005, Smith published Martha and Hanwell. This book combines two short stories about two troubled characters. The stories had been published first in Granta and The New Yorker.
