 "text": "At first, the Julia family and the Claudia family were separate families living in the Roman Empire. However, around the first half of the 1st century AD, they merged into one huge family tree as a result of marriages and adoptions between those family members. The Julio-Claudian dynasty was the first dynasty of the Roman emperors. All emperors and their families from that dynasty were descendants of the Julii Caesares family and probably even from the Claudii family. Marriages between the possible descendants of Sextus Julius Caesar and Claudii have occured around the end of the BC era, but the merged Julio-Claudian family tree resulted mostly from adoption and marriages between around the second half of the 1st century BC and the first half of the 1st century AD. Note that the names and identities of family members from the Julli Caesares before Julius Caesar's grandfather's birth is partially guessed by modern-day scholars.
