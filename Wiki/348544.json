 "text": "A dietary supplement (or food supplement or nutritional supplement) is anything taken by mouth which helps enhance food that a person or animal eats. It can be in pill, powder, or a liquid form. The supplement provides nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids. People may want to take supplements because they may not have enough nutrients in their body or may want to get more healthier. Some countries define supplements as food. Others define them as drugs or natural health products. Bodybuilding supplements are dietary supplements for those involved in bodybuilding and athletics. These supplements can help with weight gain or weight loss, or to improve their performance. == Sources of advice == * Natural Standard Research Collaboration * Dietary Supplements Labels Database, from the United States National Library of Medicine * International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements database from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements and USDA National Agricultural Library * Dietary Supplement Information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration * What's in the Bottle?
