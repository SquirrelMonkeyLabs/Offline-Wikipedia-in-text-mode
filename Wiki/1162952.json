 "text": "The Sarasvati River is an ancient river mentioned in the Indian Rigveda and other Hindu texts. It was considered sacred and significant during the Vedic period, described as a powerful and holy river.Bryant, Edwin. The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture. Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 150–155.. == Location and history == The Sarasvati is believed to have flowed in northwestern India and later dried up. Some scholars identify it with the present-day Ghaggar-Hakra River, while others link it to the Helmand River in Afghanistan.Possehl, Gregory L. The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective. AltaMira Press, 2002, pp. 91–93.. Satellite studies have shown that the Ghaggar-Hakra once had significant water flows but became seasonal due to changes in climate and geography.Yashpal, et al. \"Remote sensing of the 'lost' Sarasvati River.\" Current Science, vol. 81, no. 12, 2001, pp. 1332–1337. This drying up is often linked to changes in the Indus Valley Civilization.Possehl, Gregory L. The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective. AltaMira Press, 2002, pp. 91–93.. == Sarasvati in Hindu culture == In Hindu mythology, the Sarasvati is also a goddess of knowledge, wisdom, and learning. The river is considered part of the confluence at the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, where the Ganges, Yamuna, and Sarasvati (believed to flow underground) meet. This place is a significant religious site. Sarasvati is seen as a symbol of purity and inspiration in Hindu culture. == Archaeological evidence == Many sites of the Indus Valley Civilization are located along the dry bed of the Sarasvati.Possehl, Gregory L. The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective. AltaMira Press, 2002, pp. 91–93.. This suggests that the river played an important role in the growth of these ancient settlements. == Modern research and revival == Modern researchers in India are working to study the river's route using satellite imagery and archaeological methods. Efforts are being made to revive parts of the Sarasvati’s route to preserve its cultural and historical importance. == Related pages == * Rigveda * Indus Valley Civilization * Ghaggar-Hakra River == References == == Other websites == * Sarasvati on Encyclopaedia Britannica * Research on Sarasvati River - The Hindu Category:Rivers of India Category:Ancient India Category:Hindu mythology",
