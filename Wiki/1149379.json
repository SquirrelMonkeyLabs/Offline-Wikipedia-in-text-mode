 "text": "A tartiflette is a type of gratin from Savoie, a department of France. The dish is mainly made of potatoes, reblochon cheese, lardons, and onions. The term \"Tartiflette\" came from the word \"Tartifla\" which is the local savoyard term for potato. The tartiflette we know today was invented in the 1980's, but its original version, a peasant dish known as \"PÃ©la\", has existed long before it. == References == Category:Potato dishes Category:French food",
