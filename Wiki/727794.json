 "text": "Red Tories are members of the Conservative Party of Canada who support left- wing policies on issues like capital punishment, homosexual marriage and abortion but who are still conservative because they want low taxes and small government and have libertarian beliefs. The people in the Conservative Party of Canada who disagree with them are called Blue Tories. John Diefenbaker and Joe Clark were Canadian Prime Ministers who were Red Tories.
