 "text": "WOH G64 is a symbiotic binary with a yellow hypergiant star in the constellation of Dorado. It was the first star outside of the Milky Way to have a direct image taken of it. It was formerly thought to be one of the largest known stars in the known universe with a radius of about 1,540 times that of the Sun, however, in 2014 it rapidly transitioned into a yellow hypergiant, shrinking to a smaller radius 800 times that of the Sun, with a temperature of 4,700 kelvin. WOH G64 is surrounded by a thick dust envelope of about a light year in diameter. This envelope is made of expelled material and is three to nine times the Sun's mass. It was created by the strong stellar wind. If placed at the center of the Solar System, the star's photosphere would engulf the orbit of Mars. ==References== Category:Red giants Category:Hypergiants Category:Variable stars Category:M-type supergiants",
