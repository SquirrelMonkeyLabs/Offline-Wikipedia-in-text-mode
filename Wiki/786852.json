During his youth, he attended the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He held a number of administrative posts throughout the 1960s before becoming the head of the Abu Dhabi Defence Force, which became the core of the UAE Armed Forces in 1971. After the country became independent from the United Kingdom, Khalifa served in a number of government positions under his father. He was Defence Minister, Finance Minister, and Prime Minister. He also held a number of other administrative offices during the 1970s. In 1976, Khalifa became the deputy supreme commander of the armed forces under his father. He succeeded his father as the President of the United Arab Emirates and Emir of Abu Dhabi in November 2004. One of Khalifa's earliest reforms was announcing that the Federal National Council would have half its members elected, but the other half would be appointed by the emirs. A leaked diplomatic cable signed by the U.S. ambassador in 2010 described Khalifa as being an \"uncharismatic personage\". The Al Nahyan family had $150 billion net worth in total. In January 2014, Khalifa had a stroke and had bad health afterwards. Khalifa died on 13 May 2022 in Abu Dhabi at the age of 73. ==Related pages== *Burj Khalifa ==References== Category:1948 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Presidents of the United Arab Emirates",
