 "text": "Montana is a state in the United States. Its capital is Helena, and the largest city is Billings. Montana has many mountains in the western half of the state. Most of the eastern part of the state is prairie. Montana is the fourth largest state by area, the seventh least populous, and the third least densely populated of the 50 states. Montana and Canada share a 545-mile (877-km) part of the world's longest undefended (which means there are no soldiers or armies on either side) border. The state borders the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, more provinces than any other U.S. state. To the east of Montana is North Dakota; to the southeast is a short border with South Dakota. In the south is Wyoming, and on the west and southwest is Idaho. The first people to settle in Montana were the Native Americans. In 2018, The top countries of origin for immigrants were Canada (15 percent of immigrants), Mexico (15 percent), Germany (7 percent), China (5 percent), and Vietnam (5 percent). == Famous Montana people == * Former Senate Majority Leader and Ambassador to Japan Mike Mansfield * Jeannette Rankin, first female member of US Congress * Burton K. Wheeler, a progressive senator who was Robert LaFolletteÂ´s running mate in the 1924 presidential election * Film director David Lynch, four-time Academy Award nominee * Lones Wigger, three-time Olympic medal winner and who at one point held 29 world records * Phil Jackson, born in Deer Lodge, Montana, won NBA titles eleven times * Katie Blair, model, actress and winner of multiple beauty pageants * Jerry Kramer of the Green Bay Packers * Charles Lindbergh, political activist == Politics == At one point, Montana was liberal in federal elections and conservative in state elections. Today, the opposite is true. Although Montana is very conservative in presidential elections (it has not voted for a Democrat since 1964), it is more liberal than most states in the upper Rocky Mountains region. As one example of this, Montana is represented by one Democrat and one Republican in the Senate. There are no Democratic senators from Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota or South Dakota. The Montana House of Representatives, which has 100 members, includes 58 Republicans and 42 Democrats, making it more liberal than any state legislature in Wyoming or Idaho. == Related pages == * Colleges and universities in Montana * List of counties in Montana == References == Category:1889 establishments in the United States",
