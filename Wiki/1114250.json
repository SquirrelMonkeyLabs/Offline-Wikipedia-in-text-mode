It’s known for its reddish-brown or orange-brown color and high brilliance, making it popular for jewellery. With a hardness of 8 and an average density of 4.01 g/cm³, it’s both durable and dense. Painite was once considered the rarest gemstone in the world with only a few known specimens. == Uses == Painite is primarily sought after for its use in jewellery due to its rarity and aesthetic qualities. It’s also valued as a collector’s gemstone for its captivating appearance and limited availability. == Genuity == To identify genuine Painite, look for these characteristics: * Color: Reddish-brown hue, sometimes with hints of purple. * Luster: Vitreous to sub-adamantine. * Crystal Shape: Hexagonal crystals. * Streak: White streak when scratched against a surface. * Hardness: Can scratch glass, indicating a Mohs hardness of 8-8.5. * Birefringence: Exhibits weak birefringence (double refraction). * Specific Gravity: Ranges from 4.00 to 4.03. It should also be free from visible flaws and show no magnetic response. When exposed to short-wave ultraviolet light, Painite may fluoresce green. == Rarity == Painite is one of the rarest gemstones in the world.

Prices can range significantly, with lower quality Painite starting around $100 to $1,000 per carat and the finest quality reaching $50,000 to $60,000 per carat. Its value is influenced by factors such as color, cut, clarity, and carat weight. Painite is not commonly used in jewellery due to its rarity and value. == Famous painite specimens == Some famous Painite specimens include: * The largest known Painite specimen, weighing over 50 carats, is housed in the Natural History Museum in London. * Painite has been featured in high-end jewelry pieces, such as engagement rings and pendants.
