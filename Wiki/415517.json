 "text": "Pippi Longstocking () is a fictional character who originally appeared in a series of children's books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. The character has since adapted into several movies and television series. Pippi means \"quirky\" in old Swedish slang. She was named by Lindgren's daughter Karin, who was nine years old at the time. She had asked for a story from her mother one day when she was home sick from school. Pippi is an unusual and spirited nine- year-old girl. She has superhuman strength, and is easily able to lift her horse with one hand. She often mocks and tricks adults she encounters; she usually reserves her worst behaviour for the most condescending adults. Pippi only really gets angry when someone treats her horse badly. Like Peter Pan, Pippi does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a pirate captain and has adventurous tales to tell. She has four best friends: her horse, a monkey, and the neighbour's children Tommy and Annika. The first three Pippi Longstocking books were published by Rabén and Sjögren from 1945 to 1948. Another series of six books were published between 1969 and 1975. Two final stories were printed in 1979 and 2000. The books have been translated into 64 languages. ==Books== There are three full-length Pippi Longstocking books:\"Astrid (Ericsson) Lindgren.\" Major Authors and Illustrators for Children and Young Adults, 2nd ed., 8 vols.
