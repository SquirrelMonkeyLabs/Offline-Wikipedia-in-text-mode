On 24 October 2024, Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus announced the opening of a Facebook page called CA Press Wing Fact-Check on his official Facebook page and announced its official activities by sharing the link. == Controversies == Chief Adviser's Press Wing has attracted criticism for resorting to defending the political position of the incumbent government on a number of issues instead of committing to transparent fact checking. The first controversy emerged in October 2024 when the 'reset button' remark was made by the Chief Advisor of Bangladesh Muhammad Yunus during an interview with the Voice of America. The press wing clarified the remark and stated that ‘It didn’t imply erasing country’s proud history’. However, the clarification statement appears to contradict the earlier statement made to the Voice of America. According to the transcript, the question was based on the destruction of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and referred to historical revisionism and preference for Ziaur Rehman over Sheikh Mujibur Rehman to which the Chief Advisor replied, \"First, we must admit that they, the students, said that we have pushed a reset button. The past is gone for sure.\" Later in January 2025, it was announced that Bangladesh was revising its curriculum to replace Mujibur Rehman with Ziaur Rehman as \"Bangladesh founder\". ==References== Category:Mass media Category:2024 Category:Social networking Category:Bangladesh",
