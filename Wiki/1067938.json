 "text": "George Everett Partridge was an American psychologist. Partridge is known for having made it popular to use the word Sociopathy instead of Psychopathy. Partridge didn’t invent the word “Sociopathy”, Karl Brinbaum invented it in 1909. == Early Work == Partridge got a Phd for studying drunkenness. Partridge also wrote about education and tried to figure out the reason for World War One. == Psychopathy == In 1928, Partridge started to study Psychopaths at a hospital. He said there were three types of psychopaths “psychopathic delinquents” “psychopathic inadequates” and Psychopaths who couldn’t control their emotions. Partridge said that most psychopathic delinquents were men and most psychopathic inadequates were women. Partridge said that Psychopathic delinquents were born Psychopaths and Psychopathic inadequates were born Psychopaths but that Psychopaths who couldn’t control their emotions were not born Psychopaths. == Sociopathy == In 1930, Partridge said that the only thing that all Psychopaths had in common was that they’re bad at living in Society and bad at understanding what society’s rules are for treating other people. So Partridge decided that Psychopaths should actually be called Sociopaths. He said that Psychopathy should be renamed Sociopathy.
