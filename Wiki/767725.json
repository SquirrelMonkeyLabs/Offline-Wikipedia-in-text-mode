 "text": "The Federation Tower () is a skyscraper made up of two skyscrapers built on the 13th lot of the Moscow International Business Center (MIBC) in Moscow, Russia. The two skyscrapers are named Tower East or Vostok (Russian: Восток; literally means \"East\") and Tower West or Zapad (Russian: Запад; literally means \"West\"). The supertall skyscraper Tower East (Vostok) is currently the second-tallest skyscraper in Europe and Russia after Lakhta Center, and the 55th-tallest building in the world. Zapad is a shorter skyscraper than Vostok and is the 11th-tallest building in Russia. Standing upon the same versatile plinth, two towers grace the skyline. Among Moscow's most iconic high-rises, the Federation Tower boasts a distinct profile with its twin glass sails facing each other. Reaching a soaring height of 374 meters, this complex was crowned Europe's tallest skyscraper by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat in 2017. Pioneering the concept of a vertical city in modern Russia, each tower blends office and residential spaces with recreational amenities. The six-story plinth hosts offices and a shopping arcade, supported by a robust concrete foundation. Anchoring the towers' stability are imposing concrete cores with walls measuring 1.4 meters thick at their base, complemented by 25 perimeter columns spanning from foundation to summit. At intervals of 25 to 30 stories, steel outrigger levels reinforce structural integrity. Facades feature cutting-edge glazing systems, harnessing sunlight while regulating internal temperatures akin to traditional brick walls in insulation efficiency. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Moscow Category:Skyscrapers in Russia",
