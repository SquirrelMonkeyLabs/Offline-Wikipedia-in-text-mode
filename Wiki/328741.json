Rooney wrote the story after seeing photos in a Life magazine showing the damage done by 4,000 bikers to a small town in California after a weekend spree of violence in 1947. The story was published in Harper's Magazine in 1951. Kramer bought the sceen rights.Columbia Pictures. 1998. \"The Wild One unleashes the lean, mean Brando as a rebel without a peer!\" (Liner notes). The Wild One DVD06239. Brando was leery about taking on the role of a lowlife bully after playing Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. He accepted though because he liked the director and the movie's social commentary. == Cast == * Marlon Brando as Johnny, leader of the Rebels * Mary Murphy as Kathie Bleeker, a waitress * Robert Keith as Police Chief Harry Bleeker, Kathie's father * Lee Marvin as Chino, leader of The Beetles * Jay C.

Variety noted that the film \"is long on suspense, brutality and sadism ... All performances are highly competent.\"The Wild One. The Catholic Legion of Decency objected to the \"excessive brutality, lack of moral compensation and suggestiveness\" in The Wild One. One French journalist described the movie as \"the most unpleasant American movie ever seen.\" The magazine Positif described the movie as a masterpiece and \"the [movie] of the year\".Youth Culture in Global Cinema, University of Texas Press, pp. 22-23 Brando has written: \"The public's reaction to The Wild One was, I believe, a product of its time and circumstances. It was only seventy-nine minutes long, short by modern standards, and it looks dated and corny now; I don't think it has aged well.\"The Harley Davidson Reader. page 125 ==Popular reaction== Brando's sideburns inspired a fad. James Dean and Elvis Presley wore them. Brando's character was parodied by Harvey Lembeck in the \"beach party\" movies of the early 1960s. Presley used Johnny's image as a model for his role in Jailhouse Rock.Burton I. Kaufman & Diane Kaufman (2009), The A to Z of the Eisenhower Era, Scarecrow Press, , p.38. James Dean bought a Triumph TR5 Trophy motorcycle like Brando's Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle.Dr. Martin H. Levinson (2011), Brooklyn Boomer: Growing Up in the Fifties, iUniverse, , p.81. For 2010, Triumph motorcycles introduced a range of clothing and promotional items inspired by Brando's image from The Wild One. == References == == Other websites == * * * * Tim Dirks reviews The Wild One * The Wild One Banned in UK Category:American crime drama movies Category:American teen drama movies Category:Gangster movies Category:Movies based on short stories Category:Movies set in California Category:Outlaw biker movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:Movies directed by L치szl칩 Benedek Category:1953 crime drama movies",
