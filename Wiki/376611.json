 "text": "Insight is understanding the inner nature of things. It is a type of comprehension or learning. It can be used in several ways: *a piece of information: I have an insight into that problem.. *the way you come to know something, a kind of learning. *the answer to a question or problem. *a sudden realization: the Eureka effect, named after Archimedes. This is also known as an epiphany. Higher intelligence (higher IQ) has also been found to be associated with better performance on insight problems.Sternberg, Robert J. & Davidson, Janet E. (eds) 1996. The nature of insight. MIT Press. Cambridge, MA & London. However, those of lower intelligence benefit more than those of higher intelligence from being provided with cues and hints for insight problems.

The idea of penetration into the psychology of the mind has existed at least since 1927, which is the year Dr. E. Minkowski described the idea of psychiatrists penetrating into the mind of patients for diagnosis. A similar idea also is found in the writing/work/ideas of Dr. C. Jung sometime after 1909, which Dr. E. Bleuler described as \"depth psychology\". \"insight NOUN\" Oxford University Dictionary\"Meaning of insight in English\" Cambridge University Dictionary\"Definition of 'insight'\" Collins Dictionary\"insight noun\" Merriam-Webster Dictionary\"Synonyms of 'insight' in British English\" Collins Thesaurus Eugene Minkowski (The Schizophrénie, 1927): J.R.
