 "text": "The 2017 UEFA European Women's Championship, often called UEFA Women's Euro 2017, was the 12th time this big football tournament happened for European women's national teams. It's held every four years by UEFA, which is the organization that manages European football. This time, they allowed 16 teams to compete, which was more than the 12 teams in the last tournament. Back on 4th December 2014, the UEFA Executive Committee chose the Netherlands to be the host country for the tournament. Germany had been the champions of Europe for 22 years, but their reign ended because they lost 1-2 to Denmark in the quarter-finals. This was only the second time Germany lost in this tournament since 1993. Norway, who had won before, also didn't do well. They lost to both the teams that made it to the final, the Netherlands and Denmark, and didn't score any goals or earn any points. The Netherlands won their first-ever title by defeating Denmark 4-2 in the final match. == Venues == Seven places in seven different towns were used for the competition.
