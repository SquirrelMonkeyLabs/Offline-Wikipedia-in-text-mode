 "text": "Roland Vincent \"Rollie\" Massimino (November 13, 1934 – August 30, 2017) was an American basketball coach and player. He was born in Hillside, New Jersey. Massimino was the head men's basketball coach at Keiser University in West Palm Beach, Florida, a position he had held since 2014, and at Northwood University from 2004 to 2014. Massimino previously served as the head men's basketball coach at Stony Brook University (1969–1971), Villanova University (1973–1992), the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (1992–1994), and Cleveland State University (1996–2003). At Villanova, he led his 1984–85 team to the NCAA Championship. Entering the 1985 NCAA Tournament as an eighth seed, Villanova defeated their heavily favored Big East Conference foe, the Georgetown Hoyas, who had Patrick Ewing, in the National Championship Game. The upset is widely regarded as one of the greatest in North American sports history. Massimino died on August 30, 2017 of lung cancer in West Palm Beach, Florida at the age of 82. ==References== ==Other websites== * Keiser profile * Northwood profile * Cleveland State profile Category:1934 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Cancer deaths in Florida Category:Sportspeople from New Jersey",
