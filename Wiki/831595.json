 "text": "Poitevin is one of the langues d'oïl. It is a Romance language spoken mainly in Poitou in central west France. Like with most langues d'oïl, there are discussions as to whether it should be called a language or just a dialect. The region where it is spoken is near where the langues d'Oc (another big language group) is spoken. As a result, it adopted some of the features of the Langue d'Oc. The pressure of modern life, and the government, pushes the total use of the French language. These regional languages are less and less used.
