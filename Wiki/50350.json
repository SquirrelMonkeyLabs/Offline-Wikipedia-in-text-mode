 "text": "The Pharaoh Hound or Tesem is a breed of dog. Itâ€™s face was taken as a model for Anubis. Pharaoh Hounds always have a bright orange colour coat. They may have a small white spot on the front of their body. They need lots of physical exercise, and they are fast runners and can jump high. They need little brushing because their fur is very short. In the past, people used them to hunt rabbits. Now people keep them as pets.
