Scientists think it could live in Bhutan too. The female frog goes to a pool of water to lay eggs. She makes a foam nest on a plant or other thing over the water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that fall into the water below. This frog lives in trees. People see this frog in forests and in places with scrub plants and in paddy fields. The frog sits in bushes. They see this frog between 0 and 200 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. and some of those places are protected parks: Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve, Nameri National Park, and Orang National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
