It stars James Caan, Tuesday Weld, Willie Nelson, James Belushi, Robert Prosky, William Petersen and was distributed by United Artists. The film is known for its realistic depiction of criminal techniques and its atmospheric score by Tangerine Dream. == Plot == Frank (James Caan) is a highly skilled jewel thief who specializes in high-profile heists. After serving a lengthy prison sentence, he aims to live a normal life, free from crime. To achieve this, he meticulously plans his jobs, ensuring they are executed with precision and minimal risk. Frank runs a legitimate front business as the owner of a car dealership and a bar. He is mentored by his old friend and father figure, Okla (Willie Nelson), who is still in prison. Frankâ€™s ultimate goal is to build a life with his girlfriend, Jessie (Tuesday Weld), and to adopt a child, as he cannot have children of his own. Frank's life takes a turn when he is approached by Leo (Robert Prosky), a powerful and manipulative crime boss. Leo offers Frank a lucrative job: a diamond heist that promises a massive payday. Initially reluctant, Frank eventually agrees, seeing this as a way to quickly achieve his dream of a normal life. Leo provides the necessary resources and connections to pull off the heist. As Frank prepares for the job, he proposes to Jessie and persuades her to start a family with him. They adopt a baby, and Frank feels that he is finally on the path to his dream life. However, he is aware that Leo's offer comes with strings attached. Leo expects Frank to continue working for him indefinitely. The heist itself is executed flawlessly, showcasing Frank's expertise and attention to detail. However, after the job, Leo double-crosses Frank, withholding his share of the money and asserting control over his life. Leo's men also kill Frank's friend Barry (James Belushi) to ensure compliance. Realizing he can never be free as long as Leo is alive, Frank decides to take drastic measures. He destroys his own businesses, symbolically severing ties with his past and the life he built. In a final confrontation, Frank eliminates Leo and his men in a violent showdown. With his enemies defeated, Frank walks away, leaving behind everything he once valued. The film ends on an ambiguous note, with Frank walking into the night, his future uncertain but free from the control of others. == Cast == * James Caan as Frank * Tuesday Weld as Jessie * Robert Prosky as Leo * Willie Nelson as Okla * James Belushi as Barry * Tom Signorelli as Attaglia * Dennis Farina as Carl * Nick Nickeas as Nick * W.R.
