In Gujarat, Kolis held the high number of Zamidaris and most of them married with poor Rajput girls. Ahmednagar Sultanate was depended on the Koli Zamaidars for the Army, Cavalry and infantry during the wartime but Koli Zamidars were not faithfull because Koli Zamidar occasionally changed the side during wartime because Kolis often joined the Maratha army during the reign of Maratha warlord Shivaji in 17th century. The Koli Zamindars of Surat district and Khambhat district in Gujarat revolted against Mughal Empire in the support of Marathas but some of the Koli Zamidars fought against Koli Zamindars because during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Marathas captured the fifty two forts from Koli Zamidars in Maharashtra. In this rebellion, Many Koli Zamindars were died for Mughals and many died for Marathas.
