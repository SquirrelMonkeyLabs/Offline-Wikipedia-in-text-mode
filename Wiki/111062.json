 "text": "A Online school (or cyber high school) is a high school on the internet. It teaches students over the Internet. It means that a high school student has the option of receiving their education at home. == Locations == In the United States, 38 states have some form of Online school, according to CBS News. These schools often include giving a computer, internet connection, textbooks and Online school software. == Teachers == Online school teachers are sometimes able to work from home, depending upon the state's cyber curriculum. If the state is against the idea, then the tutor has to go at a special location to be able to teach. == Purpose == Online school appeals to all students but works especially well for those students with needs that cannot be met in a traditional classroom, such as students who are ill, homebound students, students who travel, or special education students. ==References== education",
