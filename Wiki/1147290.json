 "text": "The Mexican Repatriation Acts were repatriations, deportations and removals of Mexicans or Mexican Americans from the United States. They took place during the two final years of the 1920s and the entire 1930s. Estimates of how many people were affected go from 300,000 to more than two million people. Between forty and sixty percent of them (perhaps more) were United States citizens. The Mexican people remaining inside the United States were classified U.S. citizens and counted as White people before 1930. In that year, a growing number of immigrants and local racism led to new racial or ethnic categories being created. ==References== Category:1920s in the United States Category:1930s in the United States Category:Ethnic groups in the United States Category:Mexican diaspora",
