His video game contributions began with arcade cabinet art, then pixel art design as in the arcade Sheriff (1979), full game codevelopment roles as in the arcade Radar Scope (1980), primary concept and development roles as in Nintendo's first phenomenal hit Donkey Kong (1981), and his first console-only game Devil World (1984). Miyamoto has become one of the most influential video game designers of all time, having started video game franchises such as Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda.
