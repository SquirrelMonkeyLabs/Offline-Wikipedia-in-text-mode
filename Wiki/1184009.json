 "text": "Mittens is a type of bot made for chess, called a chess engine. It has a low Elo rating of 1, while still being remarkably strong. This discrepancy is due to the people who made the bot lying. The creator of mittens is Chess.com (a popular chess organization and website). They wanted to cause surprise and get a psychological advantage over the opponents Mittens faces. This makes it different to other engines. While the bot has a displayed rating is 1, its true strength is thought to be in the range of 3200-3500 Elo, potentially even higher. == References == == External links == * * Hamilton College interview with Will Whalen Category:Chess engines Category:2023 software Category:Fictional cats Category:Chess",
