 "text": "Syracuse University is a private research university in Syracuse, New York. It was founded as a university in 1870, but started off as a seminary founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1832 which eventually became Genesee College. In 1870, Methodist ministers moved the college from Lima, New York to Syracuse, where it was chartered by the State of New York as a university. Since 1920, the university has identified itself as against sectarianism. Syracuse was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1966, but withdrew from the group in 2011 when it decided it could no longer meet the group's standards. The school's sports teams, nicknamed \"Orange\", mostly play in the Atlantic Coast Conference, having moved from the original Big East Conference in 2013. The women's ice hockey team plays in College Hockey America. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official Syracuse University website * Official Syracuse Orange website Category:Atlantic Coast Conference Category:College Hockey America Category:Syracuse, New York Category:1870 establishments in New York (state) Category:Colleges and universities in New York (state)",
