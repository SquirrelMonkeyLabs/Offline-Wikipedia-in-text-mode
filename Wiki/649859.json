But instead of prospectively celebrating the second peaceful transition of power from one civilian government to another—which in the case of Pakistan is an important marker indeed—the general mood among observers appears to be one of great concern. General elections were held in Pakistan on 25 July 2018 to elect the members of the 15th National Assembly and to the four Provincial Assemblies of Pakistan. Most of the opinion polls suggested an overall Pakistan Muslim League (N) lead with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) being the close second. Many people are believing that the Pakistani courts and military are rigging the votes in favor of the PTI and against the PML (N). Pakistan Tahreek e Insaaf party leader Imran Khan leads in early poll results despite calls of corruption. The allegations were denied by the Election Commission of Pakistan. On July 27, election officials declared that Khan's party had won 109 of the 269 seats, giving PTI a majority in the National Assembly thus making Khan Prime Minister-elect. On August 15, Asad Qaiser elected as Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan and Qasim Suri as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan. On August 17, Imran Khan elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan ==Major candidates== File:Imran Khan - portrait (cropped).jpg|Imran Khan (PTI) from Punjab File:Mian Shehbaz Sharif.JPG|Shehbaz Sharif (PML-N) from Punjab File:Bilawal Bhutto Zardari - 2012 (7268800476) (cropped).jpg|Bilawal Bhutto Zardari (PPP) from Sindh ==Polling== File:Opinion polling for the pakistani general election, 2018.png ==Notes== ==References== Category:July 2018 events Category:2018 in Pakistan Category:2018 elections in Asia Category:General elections",
