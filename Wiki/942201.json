 "text": "Middlesex is a 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Greek-American author Jeffrey Eugenides, written in Berlin. The novel explores themes like sociogenetics versus biogenetics, the motif of rebirth, the pursuit of the American Dream, and gender roles. It includes many references to ancient Greek mythology, such as the Minotaur and Chimera. The book has sold over a million copies as of March 2011. Although not a strict autobiography, many details in the novel are inspired by Eugenides' own experiences while exploring his Greek heritage. The idea for the novel came to him in 1980 after reading the memoirs of Herculine Barbin, which inspired him to depict the anatomical and emotional experience of intersex individuals. == Plot == The narrator and main character, Cal Stefanidis, originally named \"Kalli\" (short for \"Calliope\"), is an intersex male of Greek descent with 5-alpha reductase deficiency syndrome. This condition results in a male karyotype with a female appearance. The first half of the novel focuses on Cal's family history, particularly his grandparents' migration from Bursa, Anatolia, to the United States in 1922 and their assimilation into American society in Detroit, Michigan, during its industrial boom. The second half, set in the late 20th century, centers on Cal's life in Detroit and his journey to San Francisco, where he embraces his male gender identity. Category:21st-century American novels",
