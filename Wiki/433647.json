 "text": "In Sumerian mythology, Anu (also An) is a sky-god. Anu is the god of heaven, lord of constellations, and king of the gods, spirits and demons. He lived in the highest heavenly regions. People believed that he could judge people who had committed crimes. His attendant and minister of state is the god Ilabrat. He is one of the oldest gods in the Sumerian religion. He is part of a triad with Enlil (god of the air) and Enki (god of water). He is called Anu by the Akkadians in Babylonian culture. His Greek mythology version is Uranos. The planet Uranus got its name from the Greek god Uranos. ==References== ==Other websites== *Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses: An/Anu (God) Category:Gods and goddesses",
