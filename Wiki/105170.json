 "text": "Basil II, Basileios II Boulgaroktonos i.e \"the Bulgar-slayer\", also known as Basil II the Bulgar-Slayer and Basil the Young (958 â€“ December 15, 1025), was a Byzantine emperor from the Macedonian dynasty from January 10, 976 to December 15, 1025. Under his reign, the Byzantine Empire reached its greatest height since Justinian the Great. Under his reign, the First Bulgarian Empire was completely taken by him, a land that would be part of his empire for 150 years. Because of this, the northern part of the Roman Empire touched the Danube river for the first time in several hundred years. He also took land towards the east. == Bibliography == * (primary source) Michael Psellus, Chronographia * The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 1991 == References == == Other websites == * Basil II Category:Byzantine emperors Category:950s births Category:1025 deaths Category:1000s in Europe",
