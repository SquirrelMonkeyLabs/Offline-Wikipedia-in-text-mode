 "text": "The Silent Valley bush frog (Raorchestes silentvalley) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists first saw this frog 2100 meters above sea level in Silent Valley National Park. Scientists found one adult male frog that was about 26.9 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of its back was green and the skin of its belly was yellow. There were purple-black spots near the legs. Different frogs can have different marks. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and some webbed skin on the back feet. People have seen this frog in wet forests on mountains. People see the frog sitting on young trees and smaller woody plants. People have seen this frog between 1,850 and 2,200 meters above sea level. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is at some danger of dying out because it only lives in two places, even though those places are a protected park: Silent Valley National Park and Mukurthi National Park. If people stop protecting those parks, all the frogs in this species could die. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
