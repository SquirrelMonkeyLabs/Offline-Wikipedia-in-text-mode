 "text": "Eolian (or aeolian or Ã¦olian) is an event that occurs in nature. It is related to the winds and its ability to modify the surface of the Earth and other planets. Winds cause erosion, and move sand and other materials. Wind is powerful in dry regions with sparse vegetation, such as deserts. Although water is, generally speaking, a much more powerful eroding force than wind, aeolian processes are primary in deserts. Sand dust from the Sahara gets all over Europe, and even as far as the Amazon basin.Koren, Ilan et al 2006.
