 "text": "Larches are conifers in the genus Larix. They grow on the northern hemisphere. Unlike other conifers, larches lose their leaves during autumn and winter. == Species == There are 10â€“14 species, for example the European Larch, the North American Larch and the Japanese Larch. Scientists usually divide them into two main groups, New World species (North America) and Old World species (Europe and Asia). Inside this one, there are two more groups, Northern (Central Europe, Siberia, Japan, north of China) and Southern (south of China, Himalaya, Myanmar). === Eurasian === ==== Northern ==== Larix decidua or Larix europaea European Larch. Larix sibirica Siberian Larch. Larix gmelinii Dahurian Larch. Larix kaempferi or Larix leptolepis Japanese Larch. Larix principis-rupprechtii Prince Ruppretch's larch. ==== Southern ==== Larix potaminii Chinese Larch. Larix himalaica Langtang Larch. Larix mastersiana Masters' Larch. Larix speciosa Yunnan Larch. Larix griffithii or Larix griffithiana Himalayan Larch. === North American === Larix laricina Tamarack Larch or American Larch. Larix lyallii Subalpine Larch. Larix occidentalis Western Larch. There is also a hybrid, the Dunkeld Larch, which is a mix of the European Larch and the Japanese Larch. == Uses == Larch wood is very valuable because it is resistant and it grows quickly. It is used for boats as well as houses. Larches are also used in herbal medicine and in bonsai. The tree appeared in many Monty Python sketches as a joke. == Gallery == Image:Siberian-larch.jpg|Siberian larch Image:Flowers of Japanese larch emerging.jpg|Male (above) and female (below right) cones of Japanese Larch emerging in spring Image:Larix decidua0.jpg|European Larch foliage and cones Category:Conifers",
