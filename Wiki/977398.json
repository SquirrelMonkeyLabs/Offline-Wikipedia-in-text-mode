 "text": "At Play Vol. 3 is a compilation album. It is from the Canadian progressive house musician deadmau5. It is also the third of the At Play series. The description of the album says \"After bursting onto the scene in 2006, his rise to the top was swift and well deserved, grabbing the producer of the year accolade and accumulating a wave of Beatport number ones quickly turned a lot of heads through the industry, and it wasn't long before his in demand work was being licensed to the biggest compilations & labels in the business\". Like the previous At Play albums, this album consists of \"10 Full Length DJ Friendly Tracks\" as it says on the sleeve. It can be noted that half of the tracks are from his 2006 album Vexillology and the last two are singles from 2007. ==Track listinghttp://www.play.com/Music/CD/4-/15173703/At-Play- Volume-3/Product.html#== ==References== Category:Deadmau5 albums Category:2010 albums",
