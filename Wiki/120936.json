 "text": "Freedom of assembly and freedom of association, is the right to join together with others peacefully to reach common goals and express common opinions, both in public and in private.Jeremy McBride, Freedom of Association, in The Essentials of... Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, London, 2005, pg.18-20 This usually includes business groups (or corporation), civic organizations, labor unions, political parties, and protest groups. ==Restrictions== Freedom of assemble does not mean that any group can come together for any purpose. Some governments prohibit militias, or groups of people outside the military that gather weapons and train soldiers, from demonstrating in public with their weapons to cause violence and a disturbance. ==Protection== Many developed nations protect the freedom of assembly. Many have passed laws or constitutional amendments ensuring that people will be able to freely assemble. These include: * Canada - Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which is Part I of the Constitution of Canada * France - article 431-1 of the Nouveau Code PÃ©nal * Hong Kong - Basic Law Section 27 * Article 27 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran * Republic of Ireland - Guaranteed by Article 40.6.1 of the Constitution of Ireland * Turkey - article 33 and 34 of the Constitution of Turkey guarantee the freedom of association and assembly. * United States - First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States * United Nations - Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 20 and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 21. ==References== Category:Freedom",
