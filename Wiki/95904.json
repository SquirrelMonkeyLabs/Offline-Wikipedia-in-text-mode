 "text": "Final Straw is the third full-length album by the alternative rock band Snow Patrol. It was released in the United Kingdom in 2003 and in the United States in 2004, under Polydor Records. Gary Lightbody wrote all of the lyrics, and wrote the music with Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Jonny Quinn. The album was the first by Snow Patrol to become popular outside Northern Ireland and Scotland. Final Straw was re-released in the UK in 2004 with two extra tracks, and then was able to be bought in the U.S. without the bonus tracks. ==Album credits== *Stephen Marcussen - Mastering *Louie Teran - Mastering *Iain Archer - Vocals (Background) *Bruce White - Viola *James Banbury - Piano, String Arrangements, Cello *Fiona McCapra - Violin *Ben Georgiades - Engineer *Snow Patrol - Main Performer *Dan Swift - Engineer *Garrett Lee - Producer, Mixing *Gary Lightbody - Guitar, Glockenspiel, Vocals, Group Member, Vocals (Background), Keyboards *Nathan Connolly - Guitar, Group Member, Vocals (Background) *Mark McClelland - Bass, Group Member, Keyboards *Jonny Quinn - Drums, Group Member *Phil Tyreman - Assistant Engineer *Ian Dowling - Assistant Engineer *Mike Nelson - Mixing *Jeff McLaughlin - Assistant *Chris Lord-Alge - Mixing ==Track listing== #\"How to Be Dead\" – 3:22 #\"Wow\" – 4:02 (This song is on the PlayStation 2 game Gran Turismo 4) #\"Gleaming Auction\" – 2:04 #\"Whatever's Left\" – 2:39 #\"Spitting Games\" – 3:46 #\"Chocolate\" – 3:02 #\"Run\" – 5:54 (This song was part of the soundtrack for the movie Chumscrubber) #\"Grazed Knees\" – 2:55 #\"Ways & Means\" – 4:48 #\"Tiny Little Fractures\" – 2:27 #\"Somewhere a Clock Is Ticking\" – 4:32 #\"Same\" – 3:54 #\"We Can Run Away Now They're All Dead and Gone\" (UK re-release bonus track) – 3:15 #\"Half the Fun\" (UK re-release bonus track) – 2:54 ==Chart positions== Title Release date UK US* \"Spitting Games\" 2003 23 39 \"Run\" 2003 5 15 \"Chocolate\" 2004 24 40 Final Straw 2003 3 91 \"How to Be Dead\" 2004 39 - Category:2003 albums Category:Snow Patrol albums",
