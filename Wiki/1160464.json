The battle was between the Armenians, under the leadership of Davit Bek, and the Ottomans. ==Battle== In the spring of 1727, Davit Bek and his followers found refuge in the Halidzor fortress before the Ottomans besieged Halidzor. The Ottoman forces were met with incessant attacks by small Armenian units from the fortress. After seven days, the Ottomans abandoned their positions and retreated.Hovhannisian and Papazian, \"Azatagrakan krivnere Syunikum\", 172.A. G. Hovhannisian and H. D.
