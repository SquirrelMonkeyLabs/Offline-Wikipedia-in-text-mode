However, the principality became very important because they were given the Duchy of Prussia in 1618. They then became very important in the history of Germany and Central Europe as part of the Prussian kingdom. Brandenburg started from the Northern March. The Northern March was started in the territory of the Slavic Wends. The rulers of Brandenburg were called margraves. The margraves were prince-electors in the Golden Bull of 1356. Margraves could vote in electing the Holy Roman Emperor. Because of this, the Margraviate of Brandenburg also was called the Electoral Brandenburg or the Electorate of Brandenburg ( or ).
