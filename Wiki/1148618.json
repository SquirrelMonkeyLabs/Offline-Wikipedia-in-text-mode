 "text": "African-American dance is a distinctive form of dance. It originated from Africans in the Diaspora, particularly within the United States. This dance style has evolved in various environments throughout African-American communities, rather than in traditional studios, educational institutions, or professional companies. The dances primarily focus on folk and social dance practices, although elements of performance dance often enhance these forms. Emphasizing the importance of improvisation, African-American dance is marked by continuous transformation and evolution. Several prominent African-American modern dance companies draw inspiration from this cultural dance, including the Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Dance Theatre of Harlem, and the Katherine Dunham Company. Additionally, Hollywood and Broadway have created platforms for African-American artists to showcase their talents and for audiences to engage with their work. ==References== Category:African-American culture",
