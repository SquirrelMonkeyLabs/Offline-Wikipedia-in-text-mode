Retrieved 2021-08-11. == Differences between Europe and the United States == Moving companies in Europe and in the United States often work in different ways: * In Europe, most movers give a single fixed price covering packing, materials, transport and taxes, so customers know the total cost upfront. In the United States, movers often charge separately for the truck, labour and additional services (packing, stairs, long carries), making a binding estimate important to avoid surprise fees. * U.S. movers that cross state lines must register with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and display a USDOT number, allowing consumers to check their safety record and file complaints. In Europe, licensing and regulatory oversight vary by country, with each nation maintaining its own registration system for moving companies. * European companies often use smaller vans suited to narrow streets and tight staircases in historical cities, sometimes making multiple short trips. In contrast, U.S. movers typically use large 26â€‘foot trucks that can transport all belongings in a single journey, which is more efficient for long-distance and suburban moves. * In Europe, many movers adopt sustainable practices such as reusing boxes, avoiding plastic packaging, and operating vehicles on biofuel or electricity. Green moving options are available in the U.S. as well, though single-use cardboard and plastic wrap remain more common. ==References== Category:Transport companies",
