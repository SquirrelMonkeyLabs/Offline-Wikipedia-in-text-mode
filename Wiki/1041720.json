The song was released on April 1982 in the United States and in June 1982 in the United Kingdom. The song was able to make it to #1 on the Mainstream Rock and #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Vocalist John Wetton said he wrote the song as an apology: \"the whole song is just an apology. It's just saying I fucked up. I hold my hand out and I got it wrong. I never meant it to be like that. I didn't want it to be like that. And so I'm sorry. That's basically what \"Heat of the Moment\" is\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1982 songs Category:Pop rock songs",
