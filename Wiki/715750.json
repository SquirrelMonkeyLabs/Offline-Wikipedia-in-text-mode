 "text": "A synovial sarcoma (also known as: malignant synovioma) is a rare form of cancer which occurs mainly in the arms or legs, and affects tissue around the joints. It is a slow growing cancer and a type of soft-tissue sarcoma. The name \"synovial sarcoma\" was created early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium. It affects about 1,000 people each year. It is most often seen in people under age 30 and more common in males. The survival rate is 75% at 1 years to 45% at 5 years, but this does not mean a patient with synovial sarcoma will only live from 1 to 5 years. Unfortunately, synovial sarcoma can come back many years later. ==References== Category:Cancer",
