It was released by Atlantic Records in the United States. The album was originally called Unleashed but was renamed to The Entertainer instead. The Entertainer was the second album that Dixon used her first name instead of her full name. The first was 2006's Fired Up. Dixon also rapped on some of the songs. The album has an American precision pop beat feel to it. It is a club record with the same kind of songs Britney and Lady GaGa make and sing. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2010 albums Category:Alesha Dixon albums Category:Dance albums Category:Hip hop albums Category:R&B; albums",
