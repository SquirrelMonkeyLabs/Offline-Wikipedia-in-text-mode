 "text": "The Elizabeth line is a high-frequency hybrid commuter rail and rapid transit service in London and its suburbs. The service is named after Queen Elizabeth II, who officially opened the line on 17 May 2022 during her Platinum Jubilee year; passenger services started on 24 May 2022. Under the project name of Crossrail, the system was approved in 2007, and construction began in 2009. Originally planned to open in 2018, the project was repeatedly delayed, including for several months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Elizabeth line uses a new tube tunnel cut through the North London chalk especially for the NE to SW commuters. That direction was favoured because it was especially difficult to get to Heathrow from the north-west of London. The tunnelling is new, but the line links up with older tube stations en route == Map == == References == Category:Railway lines of London",
