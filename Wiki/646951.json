 "text": "A yellow hypergiant is a huge hypergiant star. It starts off a mass of about 20–60 solar masses, but it soon loses about half that mass (because they are very unstable). It has a spectral class from A to K. They are amongst the most luminous stars, with absolute magnitude (MV) around −9\\. They are very rare: only 15 are known in the Milky Way and six of those are in a single cluster. They are sometimes referred to as 'cool hypergiants' in comparison to O- and B-type stars, and sometimes as 'warm hypergiants' in comparison to red supergiants. Yellow hypergiants have evolved off the main sequence and have little hydrogen left in their centres. ==Examples== * Rho Cassiopeiae * V509 Cassiopeiae * V382 Carinae * HR 5171 Category:Hypergiants Category:Types of stars",
