Since then, the format has not seen a lot of changes, and it has been a very successful format. WINS is known for its teletype sound effect that plays in the background and its slogans \"All News, All the Time,\" \"The Newswatch Never Stops,\" \"Listen 2, 3, 4 times a day,\" and \"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world.\" The latter slogan refers to how a segment plays every 20 minutes. While other stations have stopped using the teletype sound effect, WINS has kept it. ==References== ==Other websites== *WINS website *WINS - Historical profile Category:Radio stations in New York City Category:1924 establishments in the United States Category:1920s establishments in New York (state)",
