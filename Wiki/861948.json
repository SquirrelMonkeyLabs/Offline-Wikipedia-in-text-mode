 "text": "The Canal Zone tree frog (Boana rufitela) is a frog that lives in Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Panama. This tree frog is green or blue-green when it is an adult. When it is a young frog, it is green or yellow-green. The webbing between its toes is red. It has a round nose. Some frogs have stripes from the nose down the side of the body. The adult male frog is 39 to 49 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 46 to 55 mm long from nose to rear end. The adult male frog has spines on its front feet. Scientists think this is so male frogs can fight each other. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. Human beings do not usually see this frog. Instead we hear the male frogs singing. This frog lays eggs in swamps inside forests. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
