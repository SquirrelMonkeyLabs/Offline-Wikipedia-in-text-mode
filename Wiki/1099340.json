They overthrew the Governor of Gilgit under the Jammu and Kashmir state. The Muslim element of the State Forces based at Bunji joined the rebels. The Azad Kashmir provisional government took control of the force by sending Colonel Aslam Khan as its commander. The combined force conquered all of Baltistan. That gave rise to the present day Gilgit-Baltistan. == Antecedents == The Gilgit Agency was established in 1889. At that time, it was controlled using the Imperial Service Troops provided by the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, placed under the command of the British Political Agent. In 1981, a few contingents of British Indian Troops and 14 British Officers were added. ==References== Category:Military of Pakistan",
