 "text": "The Seminole are a group of Native American people from Florida in the Southeastern Woodlands. Today, many Seminole people live in different groups across Florida and Oklahoma. Their tribes are the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. == History == The Seminole Nation began in the 18th century, when many groups of Native Americans came together in Florida. Much of Seminole culture comes from the Muscogee (Creek) people from Georgia and Alabama, who made up a large part of the Seminole Nation when it was formed. The name \"Seminole\" comes the word for \"runaway\" in the Muscogee language, which many Seminole people spoke. The Seminole developed an independent identity over a period of time in the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this time they traded with British and Spanish colonists who were living in Florida. Many free blacks and escaped slaves settled near Seminole land and paid tributes to the Seminole tribe. These people later became known as \"Black Seminoles.\" After the American Revolutionary War, many Americans tried to move into Seminole land. This created conflict leading to the Seminole Wars (1818-1858). Category:Native Americans Category:Florida Category:Oklahoma",
