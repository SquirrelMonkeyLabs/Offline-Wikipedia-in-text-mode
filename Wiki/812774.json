 "text": "Sexology is the scientific study of human sexual behavior. This includes things like sexual development, gender identity, sexual orientation, and the question of what a normal sexual behavior is. Sexologists also look at questions as to how mentally ill or disabled people see their sexuality, or how the views on sex change during the life of a person. An old person has different motivations to have sex than a young one or a child. Sexology also looks at sexual dysfunctions, offers hints for therapies, and helps people manage them. == Related pages == * Child sexuality Category:Human sexuality",
