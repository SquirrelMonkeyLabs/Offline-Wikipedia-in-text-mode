Johnson, and Jimmy Carter) to hide their true identities. The movie got mixed and positive reviews from critics. It has a 68% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four. In his review, he wrote that \"Bigelow is an interesting director for this material. She is interested in the ways her characters live dangerously for philosophical reasons. They aren't men of action, but men of thought who choose action as a way of expressing their beliefs.\" A remake was released on December 25, 2015 and received negative reviews. == Cast == * Patrick Swayze as Bodhi * Keanu Reeves as FBI Agent Johnny Utah * Gary Busey as FBI Agent Angelo Pappas * Lori Petty as Tyler Endicott * John C.
