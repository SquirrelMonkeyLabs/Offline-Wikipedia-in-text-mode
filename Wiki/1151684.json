 "text": "The campaign to recognize Nizami Ganjavi as Azerbaijan's national poet began in the Soviet Union during the late 1930s. This initiative, called \"Azerbaijanization,\" involved reshaping Nizami's identity and associating him with Azerbaijan for cultural and political purposes. Nizami Ganjavi was a 12th-century Persian poet. == Historical context == Soviet Policies in the 1930s: The Soviet government sought to create distinct national identities within its republics. For Azerbaijan, the campaign distanced its heritage from Iran and Islam while emphasizing cultural pride. Leaders like Mikayil Bagirov promoted this as part of broader Soviet efforts to counter Pan-Turkism and Pan-Islamism. Jubilee Celebrations: In the 1930s, the Soviet Union organized literary celebrations across its republics. For Azerbaijan, this meant honoring Nizami's 800th birth anniversary in 1939 as a major national event, asserting him as an Azerbaijani figure. == Key actions == Reframing Nizami's Identity: Nizami, historically celebrated as a Persian poet, was rebranded as Azerbaijani. This involved including his works in anthologies of Azerbaijani literature and emphasizing his connections to Ganja, Azerbaijan, his birthplace. Cultural Monuments and Media: Monuments, such as the Nizami Mausoleum in Ganja, were constructed, and celebrations were held to solidify his status. Soviet newspapers also played a role in shaping public perception. == Controversy == Many historians and scholars dispute the Azerbaijani claim to Nizami, emphasizing his Persian literary tradition. The campaign is viewed by some as a politically driven historical distortion aimed at bolstering Soviet Azerbaijanâ€™s cultural standing. == Legacy == Today, Nizami remains a symbol of pride in Azerbaijan, with institutions like the Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature named in his honor. However, the debate about his cultural identity persists internationally.
