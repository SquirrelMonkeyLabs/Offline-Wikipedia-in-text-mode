This publication occurred sixteen years after the works of Phillis Wheatley (circa 1753–1784), an enslaved African woman recognized as the first African American to publish a volume of poetry, which was released in 1773. Her collection was entitled \"Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral.\" Category:African-American culture",
