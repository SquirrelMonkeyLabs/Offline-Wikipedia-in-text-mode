 "text": "VideoGames & Computer Entertainment (later VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine) was an American monthly video game magazine. It ran from December 1988 until August 1993. The first issue, released in December 1988, spotlighted the game's that were coming out in 1989. The magazine started as a spinoff of ANALOG Computing magazine. In ANALOG, Arnie Katz, Bill Kunkel and Joyce Worley all wrote a monthly column that would focus on the video game industry. When the magazine ended, they would join VG&CE; and start writing for it. The last issue was in August 1993, with the main feature being a spotlight on the 1993 video game Battletoads in Battlemaniacs. The magazine would be revived under the new name of VideoGames - The Ultimate Gaming Magazine and released their first issue in September 1993. This change was made after they held a focus group and members said the magazine had felt old compared to the competition. The numbers of copies sold in circulation were also falling and they wanted to adapt with the times. The magazine would again end publication in September 1996 after Ziff Davis bought it and shut it down. ==References== Category:1988 establishments in the United States Category:1996 disestablishments Category:American monthly magazines Category:Video game magazines",
