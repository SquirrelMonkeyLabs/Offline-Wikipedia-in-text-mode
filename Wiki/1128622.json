 "text": "Hyloxalus betancuri is a frog. It lives in Colombia. Scientists have seen this frog in exactly one place, 1450 meters above sea level in the hills near the Andes mountains. This frog lives on the ground near streams. People do not know if it can live in places that are not forests. Scientists think the tadpoles probably lives in streams, but no scientists have written about having seen them. The scientists saw this frog in a protected park: Parque Nacional Natural Paramillo. Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
