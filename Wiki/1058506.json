 "text": "The WAGR Fs class were a total of 55 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1923 to 1970. The Fs class was the result of superheating the standard F class 4-8-0 goods engines improving fuel efficiency and creating greater haulage capacity. All but two of the F class would be superheated from 1923 to 1948 at Midland Railway Workshops. In the 1950s many of the Fs were rebuilt as saturated locos for shunting duties to improve the classes' economy. Fs class No. 460 is preserved at the Bassendean Railway Museum.
