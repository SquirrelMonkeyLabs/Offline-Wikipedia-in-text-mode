 "text": "James Patrick Bulger (16 March 1990 â€“ 12 February 1993) was a 2-year-old boy from Kirkby, Merseyside, England, who was kidnapped, tortured and killed by two 10-year-old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, on 12 February 1993. Bulger was taken away from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle, Merseyside. His tortured body was found on a railway line away in Walton, Liverpool, Merseyside, two days after his abduction. Thompson and Venables were charged on 20 February 1993 with Bulger's abduction and murder. They were found guilty on 24 November 1993, making them the youngest convicted murderers in modern British history. They were released in 2001. In November 2017, Venables was again sent to prison for having child abuse images on his computer. The Bulger case created a debate on the issue of how to handle young serious crime offenders when they are sentenced or released from custody. ==References== Category:1993 crimes Category:1990s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1990s murders in Europe Category:Kidnapping Category:Merseyside Category:Murder in England Category:Torture Category:1993 in the United Kingdom Category:Murdered children",
