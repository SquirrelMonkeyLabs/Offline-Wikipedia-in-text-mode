 "text": "The Satanic Temple (TST) is a non-theistic religious organization and new religious movement. The Satanic Temple was created in January 2013 by Lucien Greaves and Malcolm Jarry. They can be found in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Temple is known for their activism and have been involved in many different cause such as LGBTQ+ rights by allowing same-sex marriages to be held in the temple, launching the Protect Children Project to help children from mental or physical abuse in schools, and counter-protesting members of Planned Parenthood and other anti- abortionists. In 2016, they opened their official headquarters in Salem, Massachusetts. The temple has tax-exemption status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Greaves says that TST is an updated version of LaVeyan Satanism and is different from the Church of Satan. Greaves disagrees with views and philosophies of the Church of Satan, calling them autocratic, hierarchical, and obsessed with authoritarianism. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2012 establishments in the United States Category:New religious movements Category:Satanism",
