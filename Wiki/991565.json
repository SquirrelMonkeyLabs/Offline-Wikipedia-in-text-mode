The site's name is a Greek word: ἄξιος (áxios), meaning \"worthy\". Articles on Axios are always shorter than 300 words and and use bullet points to make it easier for people to read. Axios produces news articles, daily and weekly newsletters for various industries, and two daily podcasts. On September 1, 2022, Cox Enterprises became the owner of Axios. == History == VandeHei said he wanted Axios to be a \"mix between The Economist and Twitter\". The company started by covering a mix of business, politics, technology, health care, and media. When they launched, Nicholas Johnston, a former managing editor at Bloomberg, was the editor-in-chief. In 2016, Axios got $10 million in a round of funding led by Lerer Hippeau Ventures. As of November 2017, Axios had raised $30 million. Axios makes money from short adverts and sponsored newsletters. It earned more than $10 million in revenue in its first seven months. == References == Category:American news websites Category:2016 establishments",
