 "text": "The Erfurt massacre was a mass shooting that happened at the Gutenberg Gymnasium in Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany, on 26 April 2002. A boy that had been expelled from the school 2 months earlier, 19-year-old Robert Steinhäuser, was the person who did all the shooting. In anger, he came into the gymnasium, and shot dead 12 teachers, a secretary, two students, and a police officer. After a teacher caught him and put him in an empty room, Steinhäuser shot himself dead. In total, 17 people were killed. According to students, he ignored them and aimed only for the teachers and administrators, although two students were unintentionally killed by shots fired through a locked door. ==References== Category:2002 in Europe Category:2000s in Germany Category:2000s murders in Europe Category:April 2002 events Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Germany Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in the 2000s Category:Attacks on schools in Europe Massacre Category:High school shootings Category:Mass murder in Germany Category:Mass murder in the 2000s Category:Mass shootings in Europe Category:Mass shootings in the 2000s Category:Massacres in Europe Category:Murder in 2002 Category:Murder-suicides in Europe Category:Murders by firearm in Germany Category:School shootings in Europe Category:Suicide in the 2000s Category:Suicides by firearm in Germany",
