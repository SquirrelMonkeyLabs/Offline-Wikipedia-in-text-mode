 "text": "Jørn Utzon (April 9, 1918 – November 29, 2008) was a Danish architect. He was born in Copenhagen and grew up in Aalborg. He is most well known for designing the Sydney Opera House in Australia. He won a contest for designing the Sydney Opera House in 1957. However, he left Australia in 1966 and never returned and saw his completed work. He thought of his design of the Sydney Opera House to be like peeling an orange, as he said putting the shells of the building together would make a perfect sphere. In 2001, he was invited back to restore the building and change it back toward his original designs, but he did not return. In 2003, Utzon won the Pritzker Prize.Pritzker Architecture Prize, \"Jørn Utzon, 2003 Laureate\"; retrieved 2013-3-27.
