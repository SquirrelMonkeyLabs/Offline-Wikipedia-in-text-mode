In 2019, she won the Anne Klein Women's Prize. She was practicing in Gießen and gained national fame, when she was charged with advertising for the termination of pregnancy ( Section 219a of the Criminal Code ) and fined. She appealed to the higher court, and in July 2019 (Az .: 1 Ss 15/19) , the conviction was referred back to the Gießen district court, which has to renegotiate the case with a view to the amendment to Section 219a of the Criminal Code passed in March 2019. == References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:German doctors",
