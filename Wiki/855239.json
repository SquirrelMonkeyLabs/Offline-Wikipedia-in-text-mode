The adult male frog is 35.6 to 52.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 45.0 to 60.3 mm long. This frog is green in color with blue, red or brown marks. This frog lives in open spaces or near bodies of water. The male frogs form a chorus near the edge of the forest and sing for the females starting around 6:00 p.m. The frog's Latin name pellucens is from a word that means see-through. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
