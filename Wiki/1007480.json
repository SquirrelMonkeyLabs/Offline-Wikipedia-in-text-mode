 "text": "The Amami green tree frog (Zhangixalus amamiensis) is a frog. It lives in Japan. Scientists thought this was a subspecies of Rhacophorus viridis, but they changed their minds. People have seen this frog between 50 and 650 meters above sea level. It lives in forests near paddy fields and other places with water. This frog lays eggs in those wet places and in paddy fields. It hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. People sell these frogs as pets. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. There are some protected parks there. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
