 "text": "A nut is a hard-shelled fruit of some plants. They are an important part of the diet. Many dried seeds and fruits are called 'nuts' in English, but only some are nuts to a botanist. Nuts are made of the seed and the fruit. Most seeds come from fruits, and the seeds are released from the fruit. But nuts have a stony fruit wall which keeps the seed inside. == Definition == In common speaking, many so-called nuts, like pistachios and Brazil nuts, are not nuts in a biological sense. Everyday usage of the term often means any hard- walled, edible kernel. A nut in botany is a simple dry fruit with one seed (rarely two). The ovary wall is hard (stony or woody) when it matures, and the seed is stuck to the ovary wall. == Types of nuts == Types of nuts include the oak, hickory, chestnut, stone-oak, birch, hazelnut, and acorn. The peanut, coconut, almond, macadamia, pistachio, pecan, walnut and cashew are not true nuts, but are used like nuts in cooking. == Nutrition == Nuts have nutrients that are important for growing a new plant. They have protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Nuts also give these nutrients to humans and wildlife that eat them. However, some people are allergic to nuts. == References == == Other websites == * Linus Pauling Micronutrient Information Centre Nuts Category:Botany Category:Plant anatomy",
