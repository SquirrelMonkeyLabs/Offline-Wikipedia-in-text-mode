 "text": "Gallium(III) oxide is a chemical compound made from gallium and oxygen. It has the chemical formula . It has several polymorphs, or different structures of the same solid compound. The Î² polymorph is of interest as a high band gap semiconductor for power electronics. == Reactions == Gallium(III) oxide is an amphoteric oxide. It can react with both acids and bases. With acids, it makes salts of the cation, and with bases, it makes salts of the anion. It is a weak oxidizing agent, and can be reduced to gallium(I) oxide by moderately strong reducing agents like hydrogen. == Sources == Category:Gallium compounds Category:Oxides Category:Semiconductors",
