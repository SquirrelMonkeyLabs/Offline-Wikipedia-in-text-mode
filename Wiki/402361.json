 "text": "Bludenz is a city in Vorarlberg. Bludenz was first named in a document from 830. About 14,000 people live there. Archeological findings suggest that there was a settlement from the Bronze age, probably relating to the La TÃ¨ne culture. Today, Bludenz is an important railway hub, at the point where the Klostertal, Brandnertal and Montafon join. It is the start of the railway line that links Vorarlberg to Tyrol, over a mountain pass called Arlberg. In the year 1274, Bludenz was awarded city rights. Category:Settlements in Vorarlberg",
