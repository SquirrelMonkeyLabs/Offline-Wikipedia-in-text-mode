 "text": "In Hungary, analog mobile phone systems were introduced in 1990. In 1993, digital GSM networks were built. These early systems only provided voice services. At the start of the 21st century, mobile data communication systems also appeared. Today, the slow data speeds of GSM are being replaced by faster technologies like GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, LTE, and 5G. == Active Mobile Network Operators in Hungary == === Magyar Telekom === The company began in the early 1990s as Matáv, established in 1991. It became Hungary’s main provider of fixed-line telecommunications, modernizing the network and offering services to both private and business customers. The rapid growth of mobile communication brought significant changes. Matáv’s mobile subsidiary, Westel 900, launched Hungary’s first GSM service on March 31, 1994. This was a milestone in Hungarian telecommunications, leading to the widespread use of mobile phones. In 2000, Westel gained access to the 1800 MHz frequency band and dropped \"900\" from its name, becoming simply Westel, to reflect its technological advancements. Another major change came on May 3, 2004, when Westel was renamed T-Mobile, and Deutsche Telekom became its majority owner. The new branding introduced the iconic magenta \"T\" logo, representing the global T-Mobile brand. A key milestone in the company’s history occurred on November 1, 2007, when T-Online Hungary merged into Magyar Telekom, unifying fixed-line and internet services. The process of building a unified brand identity began on April 1, 2013, when Magyar Telekom started replacing the T-Mobile and T-Home brands with the single name Telekom. === Yettel Hungary === Yettel Hungary has its roots in the 1990s when its predecessor, Pannon GSM, launched Hungary’s first GSM service on March 26, 1994. The company quickly became popular and grew into one of the country’s leading mobile service providers. As technology advanced, the company introduced 3G services on February 14, 2006, enabling faster data speeds. With this change, the company dropped \"GSM\" from its name and continued as Pannon. At the same time, it updated its branding, introducing the blue flower symbol associated with Telenor’s international brand. On May 18, 2010, the company became fully integrated into the Telenor Group and adopted the Telenor name and identity. This was a significant milestone, bringing global recognition and international reach. On March 1, 2022, Telenor Hungary transformed and adopted the new name Yettel. === One Hungary === One started operations in Hungary on November 30, 1999, launching its mobile network. It became the third mobile service provider in the country. As technology advanced, One Hungary expanded its services. It was one of the first in the country to introduce third- generation (3G) networks, enabling faster mobile internet. The company was also a leader in 4G technology, investing heavily in building a strong broadband mobile network. A major milestone came in 2019, when Vodafone Hungary acquired UPC Hungary, one of the country’s largest cable service providers. This move allowed the company to combine mobile, fixed internet, and television services, offering comprehensive solutions to its customers. Vodafone was also among the first in Hungary to launch 5G networks, strengthening its position as a leader in digital technology and contributing to building the foundation for future innovations. The Hungarian company 4iG bought Vodafone Hungary from the Vodafone Group. On December 31, 2024 Vodafone was renamed to One. === State Service Providers === === EDR === EDR is Europe's most advanced standby closed mobile service provider, which is available exclusively to Hungarian defense services, such as ambulances, policemen, firefighters, etc. === MVM Net === MVM Net is founded to provide specialized network services. It focuses on secure communication networks, especially for state and public services, including infrastructure for smart metering and energy management.

Instead, it uses the infrastructure of Magyar Telekom and Vodafone. The company was founded in 2012, aiming to offer simple and affordable mobile solutions for personal and business customers. Netfone focused on creating flexible packages, especially for people who wanted low-cost services or specific benefits. Netfone gained popularity for its transparent pricing and contracts without long-term commitments. Over time, it introduced more internet-based services, appealing to users looking for cheap data plans or basic calling options. While it is not as big as companies like Telekom or Yettel, Netfone continues to serve customers who prefer straightforward and budget-friendly mobile solutions. == Discontinued MVNOs in Hungary == === UPC Mobil === UPC Mobil was the MVNO of UPC Hungary that used Vodafone's network.
