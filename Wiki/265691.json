 "text": "Barium peroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BaO2. It contains barium and peroxide ions. ==Properties== Barium peroxide is a gray- white solid. It reacts with water to make oxygen gas. When it is heated very hot, it releases oxygen and turns into barium oxide. ==Preparation== It is made by heating barium oxide. This process used to be used to get oxygen from the air. Barium oxide was heated to around 300°C, absorbing oxygen and making barium peroxide. The barium peroxide was heated above 500°C, releasing the oxygen. Then it could be reused. ==Uses== Barium peroxide can be used to make hydrogen peroxide by reaction with sulfuric acid. This also makes the solid barium sulfate. ==Related pages== *Barium oxide *Barium chloride Category:Barium compounds Category:Oxygen compounds",
