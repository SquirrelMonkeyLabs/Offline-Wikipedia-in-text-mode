 "text": "RobotDigg is a company based in China that’s been around since 2010. It started in Shanghai and focuses on making and supplying different kinds of motors—like stepper motors, servo motors, BLDC motors, and linear actuators. Over time, the company has grown and now also provides parts used in things like CNC machines, 3D printing, robotics, injection molding, and SMT (Surface Mount Technology). RobotDigg has carved out a space for itself by offering a wide range of mechanical and automation components for both small-scale developers and larger industrial setups. https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/motors https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acref/9780198832102.001.0001https://books.google.com/books?id=TxKynbyaIAMC&q;=Instrument+Engineers%27+Handbook&pg;=PP1https://www.elprocus.com/stepper- motor-types-advantages- applications/http://www.stepcontrol.com/stepping101/https://projecthub.arduino.cc/JonJonKayne/arduino- midi-stepper- synth-162864https://web.archive.org/web/20161206092700/http://www.micromo.com/media/wysiwyg/Technical- library/Stepper/6_Microstepping%20WP.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140122182509/http://www.electricmotors.machinedesign.com/guiEdits/Content/bdeee4/bdeee4_1-1.aspxhttps://www.zaber.com/wiki/Tutorials/Microsteppinghttps://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/step/physics.html#friction RobotDigg focuses on helping engineers, makers, and manufacturers by offering the parts needed to build and run automated systems. Whether it’s for 3D printers, CNC machines, or robotic setups, they provide the kind of hardware that keeps things moving smoothly and accurately. Their work isn’t limited to one area—they support a wide range of industries that rely on precision and automation, making them a go-to source for people building anything from custom machines to large-scale manufacturing equipment.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214993715000032http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/43105/control- differences-between-ac-induction-motor-and-brushless-dc- motorhttps://www.dumblittleman.com/bldc- motor/https://books.google.com/books?id=iQXLBQAAQBAJ&q;=brushless+dc+motor+commutator+&pg;=PA633https://books.google.com/books?id=FkRYP7DWO9cC&q;=%22brushless+dc+motor%22+commutator&pg;=PP18 == History == RobotDigg started in 2010 in Shanghai, China, founded by a group of engineers who had experience working with Moons', a well-known motor manufacturer. Their goal was pretty straightforward—create and supply reliable motion control systems and precision motors. As more people started looking for stepper motors and linear motion solutions, especially with the rise of 3D printing and plastic manufacturing, RobotDigg expanded in 2013 to include parts for extrusion and injection molding. Over the years, they’ve grown into a global supplier, helping engineers and manufacturers around the world get the components they need to build and automate their projects. == Market Presence and Customers == RobotDigg works with a wide range of people from all over the world. Their customers include DIY makers and engineers who build automation projects, as well as industrial manufacturers working in CNC machining and robotics. They also support 3D printing hobbyists, professional prototyping teams, and electronics companies involved in surface-mount technology (SMT). To keep things accessible, RobotDigg sells through their own online shop and an AliExpress store, making it easier for customers—no matter where they are—to find and order the parts they need. == Role in Automation and Manufacturing == RobotDigg has carved out a solid place in the world of automation and manufacturing by supplying the core components that keep machines moving smoothly. Their parts help make automation projects more efficient and affordable, whether it's for a factory setup or a small DIY build. They also offer options for customization, which comes in handy for specialized industrial tasks that need more than off-the-shelf solutions. And for those working on open-source or personal engineering projects, RobotDigg is often a go-to for reliable, accessible components. By staying focused on motion control and automation tech, they’ve naturally become part of the progress being made in fields like robotics, CNC machining, and automated manufacturing. == Future Developments == RobotDigg keeps evolving alongside the fast-moving world of automation and robotics. As technology shifts, so does their focus—adding new tools and parts that match what engineers and makers are looking for today. Looking ahead, they’re exploring ways to bring more intelligence into their motion control systems, possibly through IoT and AI integration. There’s also growing interest in expanding their Surface Mount Technology (SMT) and robotic automation lines to support more complex production environments. They’re open to working more closely with research groups and engineering communities, which could help shape future products and applications. It’s a natural step for a company that’s always been rooted in hands-on engineering and problem-solving. == Conclusion == RobotDigg has quietly built a reputation as a dependable source for motion control and automation parts. Whether it’s 3D printing, CNC work, robotics, or surface mount assembly, their components find their way into all kinds of projects—big and small. At the heart of what they do is a strong belief in practical engineering and solid build quality. They’re not just selling parts—they’re helping makers, tinkerers, and engineers bring ideas to life and push the boundaries of what’s possible in automation. It’s this steady focus on real- world innovation that keeps them relevant in a constantly changing industry.https://web.archive.org/web/20090220193437/http://www.kuka- robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htmhttps://books.google.com/books?id=NgLLBQAAQBAJ&pg;=SA3-PA1https://books.google.com/books?id=PqQeAQAAIAAJhttp://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htmhttps://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA66https://web.archive.org/web/20111109053615/http://www.sme.org/cgi- bin/find- articles.pl?&ME06ART39;&ME;&20060709http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n09/historia/turtles_i.htmhttps://quickclick.es/rop/pdf/publico/1914/1914_tomoI_2043_01.pdfhttps://books.google.com/books?id=xLVdDgAAQBAJ&dq;=Torres+and+his+remarkable+automatic+devices.+Issue+2079+of+Scientific+American,+1915&pg;=PA30https://www.wired.com/2011/11/1107wireless- remote- control/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e50/0c55919cb5188ea379033bde77ac7aa2de2b.pdfhttps://archive.org/details/robotevolutionde0000roshhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11633-018-1115-1https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2007.01.002http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62996https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools- and-publications/seminars/focal-points-seminar-review-articles-future-work == References ==",
