 "text": "Tony Sparano (October 7, 1961 - July 22, 2018) was an American Football offensive coodinator for the New York Jets of the National Football League. He was previously the head coach of the Miami Dolphins. (Took over from Cam Cameron.) In his first season with Miami (2008), Sparano got the team from a 1-15 record to 11-5 and the division lead. However, the remainder of Sparano's Dolphins career was a disappointment. ==Personal== Sparano and his wife, Jeanette, have two sons: Tony, Andrew, both members of the University at Albany. At age 17, Sparano had an incident which burnt his eyes, which is why he always wears his signature sunglasses even at night. On July 19, 2018, Sparano was hospitalized in Eden Prairie, Minnesota after suffering from chest pains. He was released the following day and died two days later from a type of coronary heart disease at the age of 56. ==Notes== ==References== *http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/12/13/2543293/miami-dolphins-fire-coach- tony.html *http://dolphinsindepth.blogspot.com/2008/01/all-that-remains-are- some-mere.html Category:National Football League coaches Category:Deaths from coronary artery disease Category:2018 deaths Category:1961 births",
