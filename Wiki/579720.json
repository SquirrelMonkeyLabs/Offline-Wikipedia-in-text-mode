Later, it came to mean horseshoes & fences. * If you put an iron fence around a cemetery, the ghosts can’t leave the cemetery. * If you put a knife under your doormat, witches can’t enter. * If you have a horseshoe, you’ll repel evil spirits. Later, it was said to give good luck. == Tibet == In Tibet, iron from meteors is precious. Tibetan gods used weapons made from meteoric iron. Because Tibet is so high, Tibet had many meteors fall.
