 "text": "Dasyuromorphia are a fair-sized order of some of the more unusual carnivorous or insectivorous marsupials. They vary in appearance, from rodent-like to shrew-like to cat-like to dog-like. This order includes the ever-famous Tasmanian devil. In this order, most of the marsupials have a pouch on the belly. However, some of the broad-footed marsupial mice have only folds of skin instead of true pouches, and the numbat lacks a pouch entirely. There are 63 species in 3 families, although one of the families is probably extinct: * Dasyuridae (quolls, native cats, marsupial mice, Tasmanian devils) 61 species * Myrmecobiidae (numbats) 1 species * Thylacinidae (Tasmanian wolf or thylacine - probably extinct) 1 species Category:Marsupials of Australia",
