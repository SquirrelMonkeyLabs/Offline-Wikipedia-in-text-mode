 "text": "A tropical climate is a type of climate typical in the tropics. It is a humid climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures above 18°C (64.4 °F). Some tropical areas have rainfall throughout the year, usually in the afternoon. Others have a wet season and a dry season, for example because of monsoon. The usual tropical climate is hot, humid and wet. Cold weather effects like frost and cold weather precipitation like snow never happen in a tropical climate. One famous area of tropical climate is the Amazon rainforest, which, like most rainforests, has high biodiversity. Desert and semi-arid climates are classified separately. Some tropical areas are less wet, which makes them savannas. A few places near the equator, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, are high mountains and cold for that reason. == Examples of tropical climates == * Rainforests * Savanna * Semi-arid Category:Köppen climate classifications",
