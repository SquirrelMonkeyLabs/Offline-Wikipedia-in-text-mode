 "text": "The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies is an independent research organization, which started in July 2006. Its office is in Kabul, Afghanistan. This office is a research centre, which means that it is an important place where people can do independent research. Most of its research is about governance, security, and developmental challenges (difficulties) in Afghanistan. Most research centres in Afghanistan have foreign - non-Afghan - workers, but the people who work at there are from Afghanistan. It is a place where people can discuss ways to change Afghanistan. The workers tell other Afghan people about their research. They also discuss their research with people from other countries. When people from other countries come to Afghanistan to work, they can learn how to live in Afghanistan from them. ==Other websites== * Official website Category:Research organizations in Asia Category:2006 establishments in Asia Category:Politics of Afghanistan Category:Kabul Category:Organizations based in Afghanistan",
