 "text": "Blunt trauma is a kind of trauma that usually results from being hit by something dull and firm (like a car, a fist, or the ground). It is also called blunt force trauma. This is different from penetrating trauma (also called an insult) where an object, such as a bullet or knife enters the body. Common types of blunt force trauma include: * Being in a car accident (this is the most common cause of blunt force trauma) * Being hit by another person with a fist or with something that is not sharp, like a bat * Falling and hitting the ground (like falling down the stairs) * Jumping or falling from a high place ==What kinds of problems can blunt force trauma cause?== If blunt force trauma is not too severe, it may cause only cuts (lacerations), bruises (contusions), and scrapes (abrasions). However, bad blunt force trauma can cause many serious problems, like: * Head and brain injuries * Spinal cord injuries * Crushing of the airways, making it difficult or impossible to breath * Damage to organs (for example, collapsed lungs) * Broken bones * Severe bleeding, which can be internal (inside the body) ==References== Category:Symptoms Category:Injuries",
