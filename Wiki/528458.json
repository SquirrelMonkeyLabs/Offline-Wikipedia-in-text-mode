 "text": "Musa is one of two or three genera in the family Musaceae; it includes bananas and plantains. Around 70 species of Musa are known, with a broad variety of uses. Many bananas and plantains grow as high as trees, but they are not woody. Their apparent \"stem\" is made up of the bases of the huge leaf stalks. For this reason, they are technically gigantic herbs. Musa species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the giant leopard moth and other Hypercompe species, including H. albescens (only recorded on Musa), H. eridanus, and H. icasia. ==References== Category:Musaceae",
