 "text": "An emperor (female equivalent: empress) is a male who rules an empire. The word is taken from the Latin language Imperator. Often it is capitalized. A woman who comes to power in an empire is called an empress. The wife of an emperor is also called an empress. An emperor or empress is often a hereditary monarch and comes to power when one of his parents, or relatives, dies. In some countries, people elected a new emperor from candidates. The only emperor in the world today is the Emperor of Japan (tennō), but he lacks political power. The true leaders of Japan are the Diet and Prime Minister because the country is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The English word comes from Latin, the language of the old Roman Empire. At first, an imperator was a powerful general (army leader) but, after Augustus, it was only used by their most powerful rulers. There have been many countries in history whose leaders are called \"emperors\" in English. The leaders of the Byzantine Empire (basileus, Autokrator) in Greece, the Holy Roman Empire (imperator, Kaiser) in Austria and Germany, Russian Empire, Serbia , and Bulgaria (tsar), and the Ottoman Empire (sultan, padishah, khagan, kaysar) in Turkey all said they were just new parts of the old Roman Empire. The leaders of other countries who said they ruled the whole world or called themselves \"King of Kings\" are frequently also called emperors in English. For example, the old rulers of China (Huangdi), Iran (Shah), and Ethiopia (Negusa negast) are all known as emperors in English. There have also been emperors of France, Brazil , and Mexico, and the rulers of the United Kingdom called themselves the Emperors and empresses of India for a while. == Countries ruled by Emperor == * China (221 BC – 1911, 1915–1916) * Ethiopia (1137– 1975) * Japan (The only empire that currently exists) * Ottoman Empire (Türkiye, Anatolia, Balkans, Caucasus, Aegean and Mediterranean, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, North Africa) 1299-1923 * Roman Empire (27 BC – 476) ** Byzantine Empire (395–1453) *** Latin Empire (1204–1261) *** Empire of Nicaea (1204–1261) *** Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461) *** Empire of Thessalonica (1224–1246) ** Western Roman Empire (395–476) *** Carolingian Empire (800–843) *** Holy Roman Empire (962–1806) * Russian Empire (1721–1917) * Empire of Vietnam (1802–1945) * French Empire (1804–1814, 1815, 1852–1870) * Haitian Empire (1804–1806, 1849–1859) * Austrian Empire (1804–1867) * Brazilian Empire (1822–1889) * German Empire (1871–1918) * Mexican Empire (1821–1823, 1864–1867) * Indian Empire (1858–1947) ** Mughal Empire (1526–1858) * Korean Empire (1897–1910) * Empire of Manchukuo (1934–1945) * Central African Empire (1976–1979) * Inca Empire (1438–1533) ==Related pages== *King *Czar *Kaiser *Sultan *Leader",
