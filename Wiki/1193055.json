 "text": "= Y.M.C.A. (song) = “Y.M.C.A.” is a disco song by the American group Village People, released as the only single from their third studio album, Cruisin’ (1978). Written by Jacques Morali, Henri Belolo, and Victor Willis, the song quickly became a global hit and has since achieved iconic status in popular culture, especially within the LGBTQ+ community and sports entertainment. The track is best known for its catchy melody, male chorus vocals, and the corresponding arm choreography that spells out “Y.M.C.A.” == Background and Development == “Y.M.C.A.” was conceived by French producers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, who, alongside lead singer Victor Willis, created the Village People as a conceptual act representing various American masculine archetypes. The idea for the song stemmed from the producers’ fascination with American institutions and their double meanings within gay subculture. While the lyrics ostensibly praise the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) for offering shelter, support, and camaraderie to young men, they also contain layered meanings that resonated with gay audiences during the post-Stonewall liberation era. Victor Willis, the group’s frontman and co-writer, has maintained that the lyrics were intended as a celebration of the YMCA as a place where young men could find community and support, though he acknowledges the broader interpretations. == Composition and Lyrics == The song is written in the key of B♭ major, with a tempo of approximately 125 BPM. Structurally, it follows a standard verse-chorus format, featuring call-and-response vocals and a memorable four-note motif accompanying the spelling of “Y.M.C.A.” The arrangement includes prominent disco-era instrumentation: sweeping strings, a pulsating bassline, brass sections, and a driving four-on-the-floor beat. Lyrically, the track encourages young men who are “down on their luck” to go to the YMCA, where they “can have a good meal,” “hang out with the boys,” and “do whatever they feel.” The lyrics’ tone is both uplifting and ambiguous, allowing for various interpretations. == Release and Chart Performance == “Y.M.C.A.” was released on November 13, 1978, by Casablanca Records. The song achieved widespread commercial success, reaching: * #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 (U.S.) * #1 on the UK Singles Chart (for three weeks in January 1979) * Top 10 in over 15 countries, including Canada, Australia, Germany, and France Despite never reaching #1 in the U.S., it became one of the best-selling singles of the disco era and has maintained a perennial presence in pop culture and sports arenas. == Music Video == The official music video, released in 1978, features the Village People engaging in athletic and communal activities at various YMCA facilities, including gyms, pools, and locker rooms. It played a pivotal role in establishing the group’s visual identity, with each member wearing his signature costume: the cop, the cowboy, the Native American, the construction worker, the biker, and the military man. == Cultural Impact == === LGBTQ+ Symbolism === Though not explicitly about homosexuality, “Y.M.C.A.” became a gay anthem due to its subtext and its celebration of male bonding, liberation, and camp aesthetics. During the late 1970s, the YMCA was widely recognized in urban centers as a meeting place for gay men. The Village People, through their exaggerated masculine personas and suggestive lyrics, embraced this dual identity. === Sports and Public Events === “Y.M.C.A.” has become a staple at sporting events, particularly in North America. Fans often participate by performing the iconic arm movements during the chorus, spelling out “Y-M-C-A” in unison. The tradition began in the 1980s and continues to be a crowd favorite. === Parodies and Covers === Numerous parodies and cover versions have emerged over the decades, including notable ones by: * “The Simpsons” and “Family Guy” * Weird Al Yankovic * Political and advertising campaigns adapting the chorus with modified lyrics == Legacy == In 2020, “Y.M.C.A.” was inducted into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry, which cited its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance. The song has also been referenced in films, commercials, political rallies, and international festivals. The Village People have continued to perform the song globally, and it remains their signature track. Despite shifts in the music industry and disco’s decline in the early 1980s, “Y.M.C.A.” endures as one of the most recognized and beloved pop songs in music history. == Controversies and Legal Disputes == === Songwriting Credit Disputes === In the early 2010s, Victor Willis filed suit to reclaim the copyright to several Village People songs, including “Y.M.C.A.,” under U.S. termination rights law. He successfully regained partial ownership of the song’s copyright, reinforcing his role as a principal lyricist. === YMCA’s Initial Reaction === Initially, the YMCA organization expressed discomfort with the song’s double entendre and its association with gay culture. However, over time, the organization embraced the song’s positive spirit and its role in promoting the YMCA brand internationally. == Personnel == * Victor Willis – lead vocals, lyrics * Jacques Morali – music, producer * Henri Belolo – executive producer, co-writer * Village People – background vocals and performance * Session musicians (uncredited) – guitars, bass, drums, brass, and strings",
