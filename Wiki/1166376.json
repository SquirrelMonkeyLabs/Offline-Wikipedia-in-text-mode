 "text": "Polycrisis means a complicated situation with a lot of related problems happening at the same time, and making it harder to fix any of them on their own. It was first introduced by French philosopher Edgar Morin in the 1990s, and is gaining popularity now, in the 2020s. Combining the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, war, debt levels, inflation, climate change, resource depletion, inequality, and technological advancements, is an example of a polycrisis. Critics say that it can make solutions for specific parts harder to see, and becomes overwhelming, but advocates believe things need to be looked at together, to make sure fixing one piece doesn't make another one worse.
