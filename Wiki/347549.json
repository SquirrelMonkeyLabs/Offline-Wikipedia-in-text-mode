In 1924, it was returned to Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. == History == According to a legend, the city was founded by the Kyiv princess Olga in 974. The first mention of Vitebsk is dated 1021 AD, where it is said that Yaroslav the Wise handed over two cities (\"Vosvyach and Vidbesk\") to Prince Bryachislav Izyaslavych. In 1165-1167, due to feudal strife, the Vitebsk principality gradually began to lose importance and fell under the rule of the Smolensk princes. == References == Category:Cities in Belarus Category:Vitebsk Region",
