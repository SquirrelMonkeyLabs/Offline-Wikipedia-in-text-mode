The room is often in the basement or it's own wing. Most recreation rooms have a few game tables and board games, but large, expensive rec rooms can be full suites with casino-style games, indoor golf simulators, bowling alleys, rock climbing walls, etc. Many games rooms also have snack areas and sometimes whole bars. Most have mini fridges and microwave ovens. Category:Rooms",
