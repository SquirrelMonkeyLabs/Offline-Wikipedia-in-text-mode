 "text": "The WWE Women's Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling tag team title for the women of WWE. It is the only title of WWE's second brand extension that is made for all three of WWE's brands: Raw, SmackDown and NXT. The first champions were a team called The Boss 'N' Hug Connection (whose members were Bayley and Sasha Banks) and they won the championship at Elimination Chamber (2019) in February 2019. It is separate from the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship from the 1980s. Between March 2021 and June 2023, NXT had their own championship, the NXT Women's Tag Team Championship. The current champions are The Judgment Day's Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez from Raw, who are in their record fourth reign as a team. This is Morgan's fourth reign and Rodriguez's record fifth reign individually. They won the title by defeating Becky Lynch and Lyra Valkyria on the April 21, 2025, episode of Raw in Paradise, Nevada. ==History== On the December 24, 2018 episode of Raw, WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon said that there would be a new Women's Tag Team Championship in 2019. On the January 14, 2019 episode of Raw, Alexa Bliss showed what the championship belts look like on her show \"A Moment of Bliss\". Then, Bliss said that the winner of a tag team elimination chamber match that would have three teams from Raw and three teams from SmackDown would be the first WWE Women's Tag Team Champions. The Boss 'N' Hug Connection (Bayley and Sasha Banks) from Raw became the first champions by beating Nia Jax and Tamina, and The Riott Squad (Liv Morgan and Sarah Logan) from Raw and Carmella and Naomi, Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, and the IIconics (Peyton Royce and Billie Kay) from SmackDown. ==Reigns== As of , , there have been 30 reigns between 21 teams, 35 individual champions and two vacancies.
