 "text": "The Pinglong tree frog (Zhangixalus pinglongensis) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in Guangxi Province, China. People have seen it between 1500 and 2000 meters above sea level. It lives in evergreen forests. Scientists think it might also live in Vietnam. The adult male frog is about 32.0-38.5 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin on the frogs back is smooth and green with white blotches. The iris of the eye is silver in color. The undersides of the feet are bright tangerine orange in color. This frog lives high on mountains, near ponds. People have seen this frog between 1500 and 2500 meters above sea level. The female frog lays her eggs at the bottoms of grassy plants not far from water. Scientists think the eggs hatch into tadpoles, like the eggs of other frogs in Zhangixalus. Scientists classify this frog as in danger of dying out because it lives in only a small place. This place has two protected parks in it: Micang Mountain Nature Reserve and Hongchiba National Forest Park. People like to visit this place, and this can damage it to make it harder for the frog to live there. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
