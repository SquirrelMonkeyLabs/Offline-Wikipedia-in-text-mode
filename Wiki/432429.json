 "text": "St. Edmund Hall is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded as a hall for undergraduate students sometime prior to 1317. There is no record of the date it was founded, but it likely existed as a hall in the early 13th Century. Because the other Oxford colleges did not begin to admit undergraduates until the 16th Century, it claims to be the oldest academic society for undergraduates at any university. The Hall became a full college of the University in 1957. ==References== Category:Colleges of the University of Oxford Category:1957 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1950s establishments in England",
