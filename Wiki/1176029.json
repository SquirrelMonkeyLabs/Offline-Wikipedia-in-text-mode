 "text": "The Local Sheet in astronomy is a close extragalactic region of space where the Milky Way, the members of the Local Group and other galaxies share a similar velocity. This region is the part of the Local Volume and is located in the Virgo Supercluster. The so-called Council of Giants is a ring of twelve big galaxies surrounding the Local group in the Local Sheet, with a radius of 12 million light-years. Ten of these galaxies are spiral galaxies, while the other two are eliptical galaxies. The two eliptical galaxies are Maffei 1 and Centaurus A are located on opposite sides of the Local Group. == Related pages == * Local Void Category:Outer space",
