 "text": ": The postpartum (or postnatal) period begins after childbirth and lasts for six weeks after birth. There are three phases of the postnatal period: * The acute phase: lasting for six to twelve hours after birth * The subacute phase: lasting six weeks * The delayed phase: lasting up to six months. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the postnatal period is the most critical and the most ignored phase in the lives of mothers and babies. Most maternal and newborn deaths happen during this period. A woman giving birth may leave as soon as she is medically stable, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum. However the average for a vaginal birth is one to two days. The average caesarean section postnatal stay is three to four days. During this time, the mother is checked for bleeding, bowel and bladder function, and baby care. The infant's health is also checked. Many organizations recommend routine postpartum evaluation at certain times in the postpartum period. The delayed postpartum period starts after the subacute postpartum phase and lasts up to six months. During this time, muscles and connective tissue returns to a pre-pregnancy state. Recovery from childbirth problems such as urinary function are typically very slow and in some cases may not resolve. Symptoms of PTSD often disappear in this period. During this period, infant sleep during the night increases and maternal sleep usually improves. During the subacute postpartum phase, psychological problems may show up such as postpartum depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and in rare cases, psychosis. Postpartum mental illness can affect both mothers and fathers, and is not uncommon. == Related pages == * Pregnancy (prenatal) * Conception * Children, and teenagers * Wiktionary: peripartum (time around and during pregnancy) ==References== Category:Pregnancy and childbirth Category:Babies",
