To defend it, the Japanese military forms an elite Earth Defense Force. Under Commander Ibuki, the force begins rigorous training. Meanwhile, as their first act, the Gozma decide to eliminate those who pose the greatest risk of interfering with their invasion: the military. After a brutal day of training, the Earth Defense Force recruits are fed up with Ibuki's cruel ways and leave the training session. Soon afterwards, they are attacked by Gozma troops. Five surviving officers gather together, beaten and exhausted but refusing to retreat from the threat. The Earth trembles, empowering them with the Earth Force, giving them the power of mythological beasts and becoming the Changemen. With the mystical power of the Earth Force and military technology, the Changeman begin their war against Gozma. ==Characters== Actor Name Rangers Haruki Hamada Hiryuu Tsurugi Change Dragon Kazuoki Takahashi Shou Hayate Change Gryphon Shiro Izumi Yuuma Ozora Change Pegasus Hiroko Nashimoto Sayaka Nagisa Change Mermaid Mai Ooishi Mai Tsubasa Change Phoenix ==Cast== * Hiryuu Tsurugi / Change Dragon: Haruki Hamada * Shou Hayate / Change Griffin: Kazuoki Takahashi * Yuuma Ozora / Change Pegasus: Shiro Izumi * Sayaka Nagisa / Change Mermaid, Fake Sayaka (episode 22) and Icarus's mother (Episode 41): Hiroko Nashimoto * Mai Tsubasa / Change Phoenix: Mai Ooishi * Chief Yui Ibuki: Jun Fujimaki * Officer Suzuki: Genshu Suzuki * Officer Shoji: Hirokazu Shoji * Officer Watanabe: Minoru Watanabe * Officer Nomoto: Nahoko Nomoto * Officer Kikuchi: Kaori Kikuchi ==Songs== ;Opening theme *\"Dengeki Sentai Changeman\" **Lyrics by: Yoshiaki Sagara **Music by: Katsuo Ono **Arrangements by: Tatsumi Yano **Sung by: Hironobu Kageyama ;Closing theme *\"Never Stop Changeman\" **Lyrics by: Yoshiaki Sagara **Music by: Katsuo Ono **Arrangements by: Tatsumi Yano **Sung by: Hironobu Kageyama Category:Super Sentai series Category:1985 television series debuts Category:1986 television series endings",
