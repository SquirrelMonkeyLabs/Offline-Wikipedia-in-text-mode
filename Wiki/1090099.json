 "text": "DSB, an abbreviation of Danske Statsbaner, Danish State Railways), is the largest Danish train operating company, and the largest in Scandinavia. DSB is responsible for passenger train operation on most of the Danish railways, but not goods transport and railway maintenance. DSB runs a commuter rail system, called the S-train, in the area around the Danish capital, Copenhagen, that connects the different areas and suburbs in the area. Between 2010 and 2017, DSB operated trains in Sweden. DSB was founded in 1885, when the state-owned companies De jysk-fynske Statsbaner and De sj√¶llandske Statsbaner merged. The state in 1867, under the name De Jutland-Fynske Statsbaner took over the private company Det Danske Jernbanedriftselskab and in 1880, they also took over the privately owned Zealand Railway Company. It is an independent public state-owned corporation under the Danish Ministry of Transport and Energy. ==References== Category:1885 establishments in Europe Category:19th-century establishments in Denmark Category:Rail transport in Denmark Category:State- owned enterprises Category:Railway companies Category:Companies of Denmark",
