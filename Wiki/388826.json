 "text": "Hœnir is a warrior god in Norse mythology. He is sometimes confused with Vili. Hœnir is part of the Aesir. Hœnir and Mimir were hostages in a war between the Aesir and Vanir gods. He was also an original Aesir god himself. Hœnir usually relied on Mimir. Hœnir is the god of silence, spirituality, poetry and of passion. Hoenir is the travel companion of Odin and Loki and was also part of the creation of Ask and Embla. Hœnir goes with Mímir to the Vanir as hostage, in order to seal a truce to the Æsir-Vanir war. During the negotiations, Hœnir heavily relies on Mímir to address any query, as the latter was better informed and knowledgeable. The Vanir perceived this indecision and thus noticing a character flaw within Hœnir, which resulted in beheading Mímir as retaliation, thinking the Æsir cheated them in their hostage exchange. Hœnir is one of the few gods to survive Ragnarök. Category:Norse gods and goddesses",
