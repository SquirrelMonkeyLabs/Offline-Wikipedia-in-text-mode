 "text": "Nataruk is a prehistoric battle site in Kenya. It is located just southwest of Lake Turkana. It has the bones of people. The bones are from the second oldest battle in human history. The date is about c.7,550–8,550 BC. This battle used arrows and clubs. East of Turkana and near Nataruk, there was the Lake Turkana. The lake is much larger than now. It was important for food: many fish, flamingos, deer, and other animals. The area was full of resources for the hunter gatherers. They left lots of pottery, fishing tools, nets, etc. ==Discovery== When archaeologists and scientists studied the bones, they found a lot of skeletal damage. The damage was in the ribs, hands, knees, neck, and skull. Remains of 27 people were found there; 6 young children, 1 teenager, and 20 adults, but not all of them were wounded. The attackers are believed to be using projectiles, or arrows. The arrows made a 'pierced' damage in the bones. Two other weapons were wooden clubs and spiked rocky clubs. The battle at Nataruk was not for power, but for survival, as people competed for resources around Lake Turkana (especially when it's full of resources). The first archaeological group leader to discover this prehistoric site is Marta Mirazón Lahr. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Kenya Category:Prehistory",
