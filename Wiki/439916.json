McBrien, Lives of the Popes: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to John Paul II, (San Francisco:Harper San Francisco, 1997), p. 42 During his time there was a group of people who practiced Montanism and Adoptionism who preached things which were against the teachings of the Catholic Church. Both these groups taught that Jesus Christ was a holy person but not the son of God.
