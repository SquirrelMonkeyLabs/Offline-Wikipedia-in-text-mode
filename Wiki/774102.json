 "text": "Grappa is an Italian spirit, made from grapes. It is similar to brandy. It contains between 35 and 60 percent alcohol by volume. After the grapes are pressed, the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems (also known as the pomace) that remain from the winemaking process are distilled to make grappa. It was initially designed to use these leftovers in order to reduce waste. Whole must is distilled to make acquavite d'uva, a similar beverage. Category:Alcoholic spirits Category:Italian food",
