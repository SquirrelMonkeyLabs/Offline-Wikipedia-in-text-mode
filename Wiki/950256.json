 "text": "Network mapping is the study of the physical connectivity of the Internet. Network mapping discovers the devices on the network and how they are connected Automated network mapping is becoming more import. This is because networks are more complex in nature. Recent efforts to map the internet have been improved by more sophisticated methods.This makes faster and more sensible maps. The sizing and layout of the autonomous systems was calculated based on their eigenvector centrality. It is a measure of how central to the network each autonomous system is. Many organizations create network maps. These maps can be made using simple tools such as Microsoft Visio. The mapping process can be simplified by using tools that integrate auto network discovery with Network mapping. One such example is the Fabric platform. Many of the vendors from the Notable network mappers list let people customize the maps. == Related pages == * Comparison of network diagram software * Opte Project * DIMES * Webometrics * Network topology * Idea networking == Notes == == Other websites == * Cheleby Internet Topology Mapping System * Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis * NetViews: Multi-level Realtime Internet Mapping * Cyclops: An AS level Observatory * DIMES Research Project * Internet Mapping Research Project * The Opte Project Category:Networks",
