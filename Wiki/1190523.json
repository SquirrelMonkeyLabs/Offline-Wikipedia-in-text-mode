 "text": "T-shaped molecular geometry is a type of molecular geometry. An atom in a molecule has this geometry if it has chemical bonds to three other atoms, with two of them on opposite sides of the middle atom in a straight line, and the bond to the other atom is perpendicular to that line. T-shaped molecular geometry is found in hypervalent molecules where the central atom has three bonds and two lone pairs. (In AXE notation, these are molecules.) It is related to trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry. The perpendicular atom is one corner of the base of the bipyramid, and the lone pairs are the other two. Category:Molecular geometry",
