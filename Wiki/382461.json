 "text": "The Charioteer of Delphi is a Greek bronze sculpture from the early Classical period, about 477 BC. It stands 1.8 m tall. It was discovered in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi during excavations by French archaeologists in 1896. With the statue were found fragments of a sculpted chariot, sculpted horses, and a small, sculpted person, presumably the charioteer's groom. All would have been part of a large monument. The charioteer monument was commissioned by Polyzalos, a Sicilian tyrant, to commemorate his victory in the chariot races about 477 BC. At some point, according to Greek practice, the statue was buried, probably because of irreparable damage. == Gallery == File:Wagenlenker von Delphi Gesicht.jpg|Charioteer File:Delphi Museum 09 Wagenlenker.jpg|Charioteer == References == * Category:Ancient Greek bronze sculptures Category:Ancient Greek statues Category:5th-century BC works Category:5th century BC in art",
