 "text": "Gilbert Ryle (19 August 1900 â€“ 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher. Today, he is mostly known for his critique of Cartesian dualism, which he called \"ghost in the machine.\" He was a f British ordinary language philosophers who shared Ludwig Wittgenstein's approach to philosophical problems.A. C. Grayling (Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1988, p.114) is certain that, despite the fact that Wittgenstein's work might have possibly played some \"second or third-hand [part in the promotion of] the philosophical concern for language which was dominant in the mid-century\", neither Gilbert Ryle nor any of those in the so- called \"ordinary language philosophy\" school that is chiefly associated with J. L. Austin (and, according to Grayling, G. E. Moore, C. D. Broad, Bertrand Russell and A. J. Ayer) were Wittgensteinians. Grayling asserts that \"most of them were largely unaffected by Wittgenstein's later ideas, and some were actively hostile to them\" Some of Ryle's ideas in philosophy of mind have been called behaviourist. In his best-known book, The Concept of Mind (1949), he writes that the \"general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'.\"Ryle, Gilbert. [1949] 2002. The Concept of Mind. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 327. Having studied the philosophers Bernard Bolzano, Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger, Ryle suggested that the book instead \"could be described as a sustained essay in phenomenology, if you are at home with that label.\"Ryle, Gilbert. 1971. \"Phenomenology versus 'The Concept of Mind'.\" In Collected Papers.
