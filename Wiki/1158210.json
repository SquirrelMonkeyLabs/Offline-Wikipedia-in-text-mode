 "text": "Analog horror is a type of found footage story. It makes the viewer feel like they are part of the horror. It became popular on YouTube around 2010 because it is cheap and easy to make. It uses old videos, sounds, and images changed to look scary. People can make it without expensive equipment. == Examples == Examples of analog horror include The Walten Files, The Monument Mythos, and Local 58. In The Walten Files, old tapes show terrible events hidden by a company. The Monument Mythos tells a made-up history where James Dean becomes a leader like a dictator. Local 58 shows a world where the government gives up to strange, otherworldly forces. These stories have puzzles and secrets, and they do not explain everything. Viewers must figure out what the stories mean for themselves. ==References== Category:Horror movies",
