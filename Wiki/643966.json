Born in Plantation, Florida, Onfroy spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. His parents are Jamaican. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and released his first song on SoundCloud in June 2013, titled \"News/Flock\". He was a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s. He released his first album, 17, on August 25, 2017. Onfroy's second album, ?, was released on March 16, 2018. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Its singles \"Sad!\", \"Changes\" and \"Moonlight\" all reached the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. On June 18, 2018, he was shot to death at the age of 20 in his car after he was robbed at a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida. ==Career== He made Members Only when he was 16 after leaving Ski Mask the Slump God's group Very Rare. Ski later joined Members Only as well. In 2013, he recorded the song \"Vice City\" which was the first song he released on SoundCloud. In May 2021, three years after his death, five of his unreleased SoundCloud songs were posthumously released as NFTs with the money being made going to his charity. ==Personal life== He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when he was 13 and was re-diagnosed later on in his life. One of his best friends was fellow rapper Ski Mask the Slump God. He met Ski while in juvenile detention for gun possession. In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala. Ayala later wanted the charges to be dropped. She did not want to testify in court and did not want Onfroy to be sent to prison. He pled not guilty and was put on house arrest. The charges were voluntarily dropped after he died. Seven months after his death, his son, Gekyume Onfroy was born with Jenesis Sanchez on January 26, 2019. ==Discography== ===Albums=== XXXTentacion released 2 studio albums and 2 posthumous albums: Year Album 2017 17 2018 ? 2018 Skins 2019 Bad Vibes Forever ===Singles=== Year Album 2016 Look at Me! 2017 What in XXXTarnation (feat.

Then they shot him three times in the neck. He was dead on arrival at hospital. Michael Boatwright, Dedrick Williams, Robert Allen and Trayvon Newsome were arrested and charged with first-degree murder in Onfroy's killing. On August 12, 2022, Allen pled guilty of second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against the other three.
