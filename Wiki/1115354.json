 "text": "7Q5 is a small Greek papyrus fragment discovered in Qumran Cave 7. The fragment contains about 18 legible or partially legible Greek letters, but it was published in 1962 as an unidentified text. Because its hadwriting, the editor assigned the fragment between 50 BCE and 50 CE.M. Baillet, J.T. Milik, and R. de Vaux (eds.), Les 'petites grottes' de Qumrân (Discoveries in the Judaean Desert of Jordan III; Oxford: Clarendon, 1962), 144. In 1972, Jose O'Callaghan argued that the papyrus was a fragment of the Gospel of Mark, chapter 6, verses 52 and 53. Most scholars disagree with O'Callagan, but a minority continue to support his identification.\"... Qumran ms. 7Q5 ... is captioned as if it contains a fragment of Mark: it was of course O'Callaghan who made that controversial — and now virtually universally rejected — identification of this Dead Sea text as a piece of the New Testament ...\" Elliot (2004), JK, Book Notes, Novum Testamentum, Volume 45, Number 2, 2003, pp. 203.Gundry (1999), p.698. Carlo Maria Martini, S.J., Archbishop of Milan and part of the five-member team which edited the definitive modern edition of the Greek New Testament for the United Bible Societies agreed with O'Callaghan's identification and assertions. == References == == Sources == * * * Vito Sibilio, La datazione dei Vangeli.
