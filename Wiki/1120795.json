 "text": "The yellowbelly poison frog, yellow-bellied poison-arrow frog, or yellow- bellied poison frog (Andinobates fulguritus) is a frog. It lives in Panama and Colombia. ==Body== The adult frog is 13.5 to 16.5 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of its back has some bumps on it. The skin of the belly has some bumps on it but not as many as on the back. The frog's nose looks round from the side. It has a round eardrum. There is no webbed skin on any of its four feet. The skin of the frog's back is gold, yellow, or yellow-green in color. It has black stripes. The sides of the body are black in color. The belly is yellow in color with some black marks. There are two black marks on the neck. The iris of the eye is black in color. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in rainforests. People have seen this frog between 160 and 800 meters above sea level. ==Name== The frog's Latin name, fulguritus, means \"struck by lightning.\" ==Young== The male frog looks for a good place to lay eggs. He shows the female where it is. After she lays her eggs, the male frog visits them. When the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles on his back. He takes them to water in bromeliad plants. Female frogs are old enough to lay eggs when they are nine months old. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms, make towns, and get wood to build with. Chemicals meant to kill pests and chemicals meant to make farm plants grow can also hurt this frog. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Chagres and Area de Manejo Especial Nusagandi are two of them. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
