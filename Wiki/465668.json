 "text": "Eutelic organisms have a fixed number of somatic cells when they reach maturity. The exact number is constant for any one species. Development proceeds by cell division until maturity; further growth occurs by cell enlargement only. Most eutelic organisms are small or even microscopic: examples include the nematodes like ascaris, gastrotrichs, rotifers, tardigrades and dicyemida. == Other websites == *List of eutelic animals and other eutelic websites Category:Cell biology Category:Developmental biology",
