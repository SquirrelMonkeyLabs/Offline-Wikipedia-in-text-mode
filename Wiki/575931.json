 "text": "Sephardi Jews, also known as Sephardic Jews or Sephardim (, Modern Hebrew: Sfaraddim, also Y'hudey Spharad, meaning \"The Jews of Spain\"), are a Jewish ethnic division. * * * * * They emerged as a distinct community around 1000 AD on the Iberian Peninsula. Jews set up communities throughout Muslim Spain and Portugal. ==Evolution== In the late 15th century, when all Jews were expelled from Spain, they migrated and set up new communities in the countries of England, the Netherlands, North Africa, Anatolia, the Levant (Eastern Mediterranean), and the Balkan countries, as well as the Americas, where they kept their traditions and religious practices. For hundreds of years and through the 20th century, Sephardi Jews have continued to speak their Judeo- Spanish language, commonly called the Ladino, alongside the language of their place of residence. ==Related pages== * Yiddish * Mizrahi Jews * Maghrebi Jews * Ashkenazi Jews * Hebrew language * Judeo-Arabic dialects * Judeo-Aramaic languages ==References== Category:Europe Category:Mediterranean Category:Jewish culture Category:Jewish history Category:History of Europe Category:Jewish communities Category:Jewish ethnic groups Spanish Portuguese",
