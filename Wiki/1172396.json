It has grossed $87.3 million worldwide. ==Plot== A benevolent queen gives birth during a snowstorm. To honor the day, she and her husband name their daughter Snow White. Years later, after the queen dies of a sudden illness, the king hastily remarries before embarking on a military campaign. When he disappears, the new queen usurps the throne, revealing herself as an enchantress whose vanity surpasses her beauty. Under the Evil Queen's rule, subjects are either left destitute or conscripted into the royal guard. Fearing that Snow White's beauty will outshine her own, the Queen confines Snow White to the palace, forces her to work as a scullery maid, and asks a Magic Mirror daily who is \"the fairest one of all\". The Mirror always responds in her favor. One day, Snow White sees Jonathan, the leader of a band of bandits, raiding the pantry. When he is sentenced to be tied to the gates, she frees him. That same day, the Magic Mirror deems Snow White as the fairest. The Queen orders the Royal Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring her heart back in a jeweled box as proof. The Huntsman instead warns Snow White of the Queen's intentions. At his urging, Snow White flees deep into the forest. Lost and frightened, Snow White is befriended by woodland animals, who lead Snow White to a secluded cottage, where she falls asleep. She awakens later that night to find herself confronted by the owners, seven \"magical beings\" named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a diamond mine. They sympathize with her and agree to let her stay. Meanwhile, the Queen, having learned from the Magic Mirror that Snow White is still alive, imprisons the Huntsman before ordering a search. Snow White and Jonathan meet again in the forest and fend off the guards alongside the bandits. The two realize their feelings for each other before Jonathan departs to find the king, whom Snow White believes may still be alive. Jonathan is captured by the guards and imprisoned by the Queen, who deduces Snow White's whereabouts. Retreating to her secret chambers, she creates a magic poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a death-like sleep. Transforming into a peddler woman, the Queen goes to the cottage after the miners leave for work. The animals, seeing through the disguise, rush off to get the miners. Claiming to be an ally of Jonathan's, the Queen tricks Snow White into taking a bite of the apple, and she falls into a death-like sleep. During this, the Queen reveals to her stepdaughter that she killed her father, and retreats just as the miners and animals arrive. Having escaped with the Huntsman's help, Jonathan arrives to discover her dead and mournfully kisses her. Snow White awakens and rallies the miners and Jonathan's bandits to overthrow the Evil Queen. Snow White confronts her stepmother, who forcefully goads her to take the throne, placing a diamond dagger into her hand. Snow White refuses to hurt her, reminding the people what the kingdom used to be like under her parents' rule. Moved, the guards turn on the Queen and join the miners, the bandits, the Huntsman, and the civilians. The Queen tries to attack Snow White, but the miners and bandits defend her. The Magic Mirror tells the Queen that Snow White will always be fairer than her due to her kindness and justness. Snow White arrives to see the Queen destroying the Mirror, the source of her powers. As a result, she turns into glass herself and disappears into a vortex while the Magic Mirror repairs itself. With Snow White named the new queen at a grand party, everyone in the kingdom arrives to celebrate. ==Cast== * Rachel Zegler as Snow White, a fearless and pure-hearted princess who is determined to free her kingdom from her stepmother's tyranny. ** Emilia Faucher as young Snow White * Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, Snow White's jealous, tyrannical stepmother who is obsessed with being the fairest one of all. * Andrew Burnap as Jonathan, a new character created for the film as Snow White's love interest (partially based on the Prince from the original film) and a rebel who wants to defy the Evil Queen's monarchy. * Ansu Kabia as the Huntsman, an unnamed hunter and the Evil Queen's servant whom she orders to kill Snow White and bring back her heart. * Patrick Page as the voice/facial motion-capture of the Magic Mirror, a mirror containing a being that would truthfully answer the Evil Queen's question on who is the fairest one of all. ===The Seven Magical Beings=== * Jeremy Swift as the voice/facial motion-capture of Doc, the intelligent leader of the seven magical beings. ** Jonathan Bourne as the motion- capture/puppeteer of Doc * Martin Klebba as the voice/facial motion-capture of Grumpy, a grouchy member of the seven magical beings. ** Omari Bernard as the motion-capture/puppeteer of Grumpy * George Salazar as the voice/facial motion-capture of Happy, a cheerful member of the seven magical beings. ** David Birch as the motion-capture/puppeteer of Happy * Tituss Burgess as the voice/facial motion-capture of Bashful, a shy member of the seven magical beings. ** Leah Haile as the motion-capture/puppeteer of Bashful * Andrew Grotelueschen as the voice/facial motion-capture of Sleepy, a tired member of the seven magical beings. ** Sandy Foster as the motion-capture/puppeteer of Sleepy * Jason Kravits as the voice/facial motion-capture of Sneezy, a member of the seven magical beings who sneezes frequently. ** Dominic Owen as the motion-capture/puppeteer of Sneezy * Andrew Barth Feldman as the voice/facial motion-capture of Dopey, a member of the seven magical beings who does not speak and makes other sounds until after Jonathan wakes Snow White from her Sleeping Death.
