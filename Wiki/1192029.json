 "text": "== Horror and Fantasy Cinema in Argentina == Horror and fantasy cinema in Argentina includes movies that explore fear, the supernatural, science fiction, and strange stories. These movies often mix social criticism, artistic experiments, and political memory. From early movies to new independent films, this genre has grown and changed over time. It has gained attention in Argentina and other countries. === History and Early Works === One of the first important figures in Argentine horror was Narciso Ibáñez Menta. He was an actor and director known for his work in movies and TV. His work mixed classic horror with Argentine culture. Early science fiction movies include \"Invasión\" (1969), based on a script by Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares. This movie had themes similar to the famous Argentine comic \"El Eternauta\" by Héctor Germán Oesterheld. These films helped start the genre in Argentina. === International Productions in Argentina === In 1991, the movie \"Highlander 2: The Quickening\" was filmed partly in Buenos Aires. This was one of the first international movies made in Argentina and helped bring more foreign productions later. === Historical Revisionism and Political Horror === \"47, el muerto\" (2000) is a short film directed by Andrés Dentoni and Fernando Gabriel Sosa. It is an early example of political horror that mixes history and fear. The story shows a former military officer haunted by the ghost of a disappeared activist. It was shown at the National University of Córdoba's Film and TV School in 2003. === Independent and University Films === In the 2000s, many horror films were made in universities and by independent filmmakers. They were influenced by styles like Dogma 95, found footage, and psychological horror. \"47, el muerto\" is part of this group. === Important Film Groups === Farsa Producciones is a group important for independent horror in Argentina. Their movies include \"Plaga Zombie,\" \"Necronomicón,\" \"La bruja,\" and \"Cuando acecha la maldad\" (2023). They use gore, satire, and handmade effects. === Influences and Connections === The 1986 movie \"Hombre mirando al sudeste\" is seen as an influence on the American movie \"K-PAX.\" The Argentine series \"Cybersix\" inspired the American series \"Dark Angel\" by James Cameron, leading to discussions about plagiarism. The movie \"La sonámbula: recuerdos del futuro\" by Fernando Spiner has a similar feel to Guillermo del Toro's \"Cronos.\" Both share themes of metaphysical horror and have connections to the comic \"Mort Cinder\" by Alberto Breccia, whom del Toro admires. === Notable Movies === * \"La sonámbula\" (1998) * \"Balada para un Kaiser Carabela\" (1987) with music by Luis Alberto Spinetta * \"Necronomicón\" (2018) * \"Cuando acecha la maldad\" (2023) * \"La bruja\" (2019) === References === * Curubeto, Diego.
