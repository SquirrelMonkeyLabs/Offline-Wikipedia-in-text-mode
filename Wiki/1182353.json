 "text": "The iMac is a series of all-in-one desktop computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Inc. Between 2006 and 2022, the iMac series used chipsets based on Intel architecture. While sold, it was one of three desktop computers in the Mac lineup, serving as an all-in-one alternative to the Mac Mini, and sat below the performance range Mac Pro. It was sold alongside a higher-end, Xeon-based iMac Pro from 2017 to 2021. The earliest Intel iMacs reused the same white polycarbonate enclosure as the iMac G5. Later models shifted to aluminum and plastic, and then a unibody aluminum case. The iMacs released after October 2012 also featured a much thinner display, with the edge measuring just 5 mm. This design would persist until the line was discontinued. As part of the Mac transition to Apple's own processors, the Intel-based iMac was succeeded by the Apple silicon iMac beginning in 2021. Apple discontinued the 21.5-inch Intel iMac the same year, with the 27-inch model discontinued in March 2022, following the announcement of the Mac Studio and 27-inch Apple Studio Display. == References == Category:Apple hardware Category:Computer hardware",
