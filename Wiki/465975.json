 "text": "Maryam Mahboob (born 1955) is an Afghan writer. She writes about patriarchy and migrants in Afghanistan. She was born in Maimana, Afghanistan in 1955. She moved a lot because her father worked for the government. She went to college in Kabul and at the University of Tehran. She had to leave Afghanistan in 1979 after the Soviet War. She moved to Pakistan and then moved to Delhi, in India, in 1981. She created a journal, along with other Afghani who were living outside Afghanistan, called Gahanama. The government of Afghanistan and the Mujahideen were angry about the journal and Mahboob had to move to Canada in 1983. Today, she writes a lot about Afghani communities around the world. She writes mainly about women's rights. ==References== Category:Feminists Category:Afghan writers Category:1955 births Category:21st-century Afghan people Category:20th-century Afghan people",
