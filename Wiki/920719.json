He was the 44th Prime Minister of South Korea from 2022 until 2025. He was prime minister before in 2006 and from 2007 until 2008. Han was the ambassador to the United States from 2009 to 2013.

He briefly ran for president in the 2025 snap presidential election. ==Prime Minister of South Korea== When he became prime minister again in 2022 at aged 72, Han became the oldest person to be prime minister. On 10 April 2024, Duck-soo offered his resignation following his party's defeat in that year's legislative elections. Han became the acting President of South Korea following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol on 14 December 2024. Han was impeached by all 192 present MPs on 27 December 2024, and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok became acting president and prime minister. On 24 March 2025, the Constitutional Court dismisses the impeachment of Han, letting him return as acting president. ==2025 presidential campaign== In May 2025, Han announced his resignation as both the acting president and the prime minister while also announcing his candidacy for president in the 2025 snap election. A few days later, his independent campaign was merged with the People Power Party after the party cancelled Kim Moon-soo's campaign in favor for Han's. However that same day, members of the PPP voted to make Kim the nominee again. Han apologized for the candidacy dispute and withdrew from the election soon afterwards. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of South Korea Category:Presidents of South Korea",
