 "text": "Osmoderma eremita, or Eremit, is a dark-brown beetle with a glossy surface and has a length of 20 to 40 mm in adult stage. It smells like leather or apricot. The beetle is common in Europe, except for the United Kingdom, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, and San Marino. The Eremit lives near old trees in parks, avenues and roadsides. Due to loss of old trees, the beetle has decreased all over its distribution range. ==References== ==Other websites== *European summary of what is known about the species Category:Polyphaga Category:Animals of Europe",
