 "text": "The Jimmy Carter rabbit incident, also known as a \"killer rabbit attack\" by the press, involved a swamp rabbit that swam toward thenâ€“U.S. President Jimmy Carter's fishing boat on April 20, 1979. The incident became popular in the media after Carter's press secretary, Jody Powell, mentioned the event to a correspondent months later. President Carter was fishing in his hometown of Plains, Georgia on April 20, 1979, alone in a flat-bottomed boat while staff were on land nearby. Carter said a rabbit being chased by hounds \"jumped in the water and swam toward my boat. When he got almost there, I splashed some water with a paddle\". When Carter returned to his office, his staff did not believe his story, saying rabbits could not swim, or that one would never approach a person threateningly. A White House photographer took a picture of the incident, which was released by a later administration. ==References== Category:Jimmy Carter Category:1979 in the United States",
