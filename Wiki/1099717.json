It was also the last game in the series to be made by Neversoft. It was released on October 16, 2007 for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. It would be released later in 2008 for Mobile. The game takes place in the United States. In the game, players create their skater and can choose a path to choose from. The styles they can choose from are either Career, Hardcore, and Rigger. The player can choose whether they want to follow the main story or branch off and choose different styles to use. Different levels are opened depending on which path is chosen and which version of the game is being played. ==Reception== The game was both mixed and liked by game critics. Critics said that they liked the new moves and different skill levels. However, they did not like that the graphics glitched and that the game felt more like an expansion pack rather than an actual game. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2007 video games Category:Tony Hawk video games Category:Activision video games Category:Neversoft games Category:Vicarious Visions games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Single- player video games Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii games Category:Xbox 360 games",
