 "text": "Ectopoglossus isthminus is a frog. It lives in Panama. ==Body== Scientists caught a few frogs before 2012. The adult male frogs were 19â€“21 mm long from nose to rear end and one adult female frog was 23 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with darker brown patterns. There are small, light yellow spots in the places where the four legs meet the body. The belly is light blue in color with some dark color. ==Name== The scientists named the frog isthminus because it lives on the isthmus of Panama. An isthmus is a piece of land that connects two other pieces of land. Panama connects North American with South America. ==Home== This frog lives in near streams in forests in the Chargas area in Panama. Scientists saw the frog between 150 and 810 meters above sea level. Most of these frogs live in one protected park: Chagres National Park. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis may have killed many of these frogs, but they have not tested the frog for the fungus yet. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
