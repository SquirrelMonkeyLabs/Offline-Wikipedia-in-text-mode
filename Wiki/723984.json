He became the first American world heavyweight champion in nine years, which was the longest period of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As an amateur, he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. This led to his nickname of \"The Bronze Bomber\", inspired by Joe Louis, who was known by the nickname of \"The Brown Bomber\". Wilder has had 44 professional bouts, winning 42 and drawing and losing once to Briton Tyson Fury. Of his 42 wins, Wilder has won 41 of his fights by knockout. He has a knockout-to-win ratio standing at 98%. Wilder was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
