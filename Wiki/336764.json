 "text": "Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game made by Finnish developers Remedy Entertainment and published by Gathering of Developers in July 2001 for Microsoft Windows. Later in 2001, ports for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameBoy Advance were published by Rockstar Games. A Macintosh port was published in July 2002 by MacSoft in North America, and by Feral Interactive in the rest of the world. There were plans for a Dreamcast version of Max Payne, but they were cancelled because of the console had stopped being made. The game was again released in April 2009 as a downloadable game for the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360. The game features a neo-noir type style and uses comic strips (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game. This is because it is inspired by hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many references to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnar√∂k. Several of the names used in the game are those of Norse gods. The gameplay is very much influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was the first game to feature the bullet time effect made famous in The Matrix. Max Payne got very good reviews from critics and was praised for its exciting gun play and use of noir storytelling devices. As of 2012, the Max Payne franchise has sold over 7.5 million copies. The game has also won a BAFTA Award. == Sequels == The game was followed by Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, released in 2003. And Max Payne 3, released in 2012. == References == == Other websites == * Max Payne * Max Payne archives at 3D Realms * * Category:2001 video games Category:Rockstar Games games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Detective video games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Neo-noir video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Single-player video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games about the illegal drug trade Category:Video games based on Norse mythology Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games",
