 "text": "This is a list of the most common genetic disorders in humans. If known, the type of mutation is shown, and the chromosome involved. *P – Point mutation, or any insertion/deletion entirely inside one gene *D – Deletion of a gene or genes *Dup - Duplication of a gene or genes *C – Whole chromosome extra, missing, or both (see chromosomal aberrations) *T – Trinucleotide repeat disorders: gene is extended in length Many other conditions are known to be partly or wholly inherited, but their genetic basis is not yet clear. A good example is \"clefting\" (cleft lip and palate), which occurs up to 4 per 1000 in Native Americans and some Asian populations, but which is almost unknown in African populations.See About 20 genes are under investigation.FaceBase. (2012). Gene Wiki. Retrieved from https://www.facebase.org/resources/gene-wiki . Another important and common example is schizophrenia. Estimates of the heritability of schizophrenia are between 70% and 80%. This means 70% to 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is associated with genetics.van de Leemput J, Hess JL, Glatt SJ, Tsuang MT 2016.
