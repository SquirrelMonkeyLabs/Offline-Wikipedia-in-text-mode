 "text": "Al-Mulk 1â€“30 is the 67th surah in the Quran. The main meaning of this surah is \"dominion\" and the word \"Mulk\" means \"kingships\". Surah Al Mulk is believed to have been revealed to Muhammad in Makkah during the early years of Islam. It has 2 Ruku and 30 Ayayts (verses). Surah Al Mulk is divided into three main sections, such as the nature of Allah, the creation of the universe, and the Day of Judgment. Each section deals with a different aspect and meaning. The theme of Surah Mulk is: \"No individual can impose his will on another, and Allah Almighty is the master of the whole universe, and He has control over everything.\" Surah Mulk protects its reciter from the punishment of the grave and serves as a shield in the hereafter. It also intercedes for forgiveness on the Day of Judgment, ensuring mercy and blessings. Regular recitation brings peace, security, and divine protection in both this life and the next. ==References== Category:Chapters in the Quran",
