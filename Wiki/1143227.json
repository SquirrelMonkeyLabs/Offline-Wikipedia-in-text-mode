 "text": "A fart fetish, or eproctophilia is a paraphilia or attraction to the sound, smell (flatophilia), or act of passing gas (flatulence). People with this fetish find arousal from hearing a fart, the feeling of a fart caressing their skin, from the idea of farting themselves (Erotic Target Location Error), and/or from the specific sounds and/or smells associated with it. They often incorporate farts into their sexual experiences, an example being when the dominant person farts on the submissive person's penis. ==Etymology== The term eproctophilia is formed from three parts: * Latin prefix e- – a formative element (here serving to link the root and suffix) * Ancient Greek noun πρωκτός (prōktós) – “anus” * Greek suffix -φιλία (-philia) – “love” or “affection” Then, eproctophilia means “love of the anus.” ==Characteristics== For an eproctolagniac (a person who suffers from fart fetishism), some points of attraction include the level of odor, the sound level, and the duration of the fart. Fart fetishism may also be known to be valued as means of sadomasochism and humiliation. It is one of the most common forms of olfactophilia (odor fetishism). The fetish can vary greatly. Some eproctolagniacs may be attracted to the art of farting in private or public settings. In contrast, others may enjoy the interaction between other partners who fart or talk about farts in a sexual context. Eproctolagniacs may deliberately consume inulin to produce more intestinal gas. Some may derive intense pleasure from using public restrooms due to the sensual stimuli. ==Prevalence== Eproctophilia is considered very rare, and empirical data on its prevalence is limited. It may be more common in men than in women. In a representative survey of 1,040 adults in Quebec, 15.9% of respondents indicated an interest in fetishistic behaviors. This could suggest fart fetishism is more common, but more research is needed. ==Causes== Some experts believe this behaviour is caused by traumatic childhood experiences alongside behavioural conditioning. For example, if the sound or smell of farts is consistently paired with sexual arousal at a presumably young age, then it can form a neural pathway where farting can become a trigger for sexual excitement on its own. This is called sexual imprinting. A portion of eproctolagniacs may have neurobiological differences, such as differences in brain structure or function, including aberrations in neural circuits related to sexual arousal that may play a role in their liking of farts. Some psychological fixations, possibly related to the anal stage of psychosexual development (ages 1-3) as proposed by Sigmund Freud, may contribute to the emergence of eproctophilia. Put, some eproctolagniacs are aroused by farts because they come from the buttocks, which they find attractive. The taboos and social stigma may also contribute to the development of the fetish for some individuals. Some eproctolagniacs espouse the act of farting to be seen as an act of intimacy and breaking down barriers. Studies have also shown that olfactory function is associated with sexual motivation and satisfaction. It is therefore plausible that olfactory stimuli, particularly those associated with early childhood experiences, may play a role in the development of eproctophilic arousal. However, no singular cause has been definitively established. The heterogeneity in its manifestation suggests that multiple psychological and developmental factors may be involved, as with other fetishes. ==As a paraphilic disorder== It is important to note that having a fart fetish is not recognized to be a disorder. Treatment for eproctophilia is generally not needed unless it starts becoming a problem or is ego-dystonic. In severe cases, eproctolagniacs may be unable to derive sexual gratification unless their partner farts, which can present challenges if they are unable to do so. This might pressure the farting partner to eat more gas producing food or pump air into their anus to satisfy the eproctolagniac, which can pose health problems. In cases like these, the eproctolagniac may be diagnosed with fetishism disorder under DSM-5, as the fetish is coupled with significant distress or peril. If one with eproctophilia wants to ameliorate their condition, they can get professional mental help. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been the primary source to address maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors, such as eproctophilia. Treatment could also include redirecting masturbatory fantasies to conventional ones. In some cases, CBT can be used in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or aversion therapy by using negative punishment to help reduce compulsive behaviors. Its use is associated with lower recidivism. As a last resort, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, antiandrogens, or castration can be used. However, they come along with problematic side effects such as osteoporosis and liver dysfunction. All in all, the prognosis of eproctophilia is poor. Fart fetishism is generally considered unalterable and life-long, but CBT can help reduce negative symptoms and criminal behaviour. There are no significant studies specifically focused on fart fetishism. Still, it is considered one of the many forms of sexual interest that can be classified as a paraphilia, which refers to unusual sexual preferences. Fart fetishism typically becomes more noticeable in adulthood, though the specific causes or origins of this interest are not very well understood. == Cultural and social context== Flatulence (and, more broadly, fart fetishism) is often viewed negatively in virtually every culture, contributing to the taboo surrounding eproctophilia. In many societies, flatulence is considered socially inappropriate or embarrassing, which may intensify the fetishistic allure for some individuals (abjection). On the contrary, the stigma may lead some individuals with this fetish to feel isolated or reluctant to discuss their interests openly, which can exacerbate eproctophilia. This may impede their access to treatment, a crucial safeguard against the commission of sexual offenses. Although it is not widely discussed, it exists as part of the diversity of human sexual preferences. James Joyce, the renowned Irish author, exhibited eproctophilic tendencies, as evidenced by his intimate correspondence with Nora Barnacle. James Joyce's intimate letters to Nora Barnacle revealed his fascination with her farts, as he expressed a desire to hear her \"tiny little naughty farties\" and described them as \"fat dirty farts.\" A notable incident is when Stephanie Matto adopted a high-protein and high-fiber bdolotic diet to accommodate her business of jars containing her farts. This practice eventually led her to difficulty breathing and hospitalization caused by excessive gas accumulation. In Brazil, the production company MFX Media makes fetish videos that includes fart-fetish content. The company gained international attention after they released a video titled \"2 Girls 1 Cup\". The video showed extreme fetish acts and was made by MFX Media's director, Marco Antônio Fiorito. Fiorito described himself as a \"compulsive fetishist\" and began making fetish films in the 1990s. Some of his films have caused legal issues in the United States, where authorities considered them obscene. Research has shown that trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide may prevent mitochondrial damage in cells. This has led to the erroneous belief that smelling farts could have health benefits. As with all sexual preferences, the key to a healthy experience is mutual consent, respect, and communication between individuals involved. Non-consensual exposure or involving non-consenting individuals is highly unethical and generally illegal. == Related pages == *Flatulence *Coprophilia *Paraphilia *Sexual fetishism *Feces *Foot odor *Human sexuality *BDSM *Social stigma *Mental illness ==References== ==Further reading== * ==Other websites== *Eproctophilia *Eproctophilia.org *Fart Fetish Podcast Category:Human sexuality Category:BDSM Category:Paraphilias Category:Sexual fetishism Category:Flatulence",
