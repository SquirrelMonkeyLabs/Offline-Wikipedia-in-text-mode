 "text": "Marine Park of Moheli is marine protected area on the Mozambique Canal and the first protected area in the Comoros. It was established on April 19, 2002. The most characteristic of the park is the presence of rare fishes and other various types of sharks and humpback whales. Moheli Island in Comoros was the most appropriate place for an initiative that brought together international and local communities in creating a joint marine protected area. Its idea involves the preservation of 404 square kilometres of the sea in which the main marine species such as Coelacanth, humpback whales, dolphins, etc., can live. == References == Category:Geography of the Comoros",
