 "text": "The Wahhabi conquest of Hejaz was a major military operation carried out by the Emirate of Diriyah—known as theFirst Saudi state—under the leadership of Imam Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. It aimed to expand the influence of the Wahhabi reformist movement by bringing the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina under Saudi control. The campaign marked one of the most significant military advances of the Saudi-Wahhabi alliance during the early 19th century. ==Background== Following the assassination of Imam Abdulaziz in 1803, his son, Saud bin Abdulaziz assumed leadership of the Emirate of Diriyah. By that time, the Saudis had already consolidated control over most of the Najd region and were actively expanding into eastern and central Arabia. The Wahhabi ideology, which sought to purify Islam by eliminating practices considered as polytheistic innovations (bid‘ah), provided a strong religious motive for the campaign. ==Military Campaign== In 1803, Saudi forces began their advance into the Hejaz, exploiting political instability within the region. The city of Ta’if was captured first, followed by the entry into Mecca in the same year. Mecca surrendered with minimal resistance as the local Sharif, Ghalib ibn Musa’id, fled the city. By 1804, Medina was also captured, giving the Saudis control over both Islamic holy cities. The Saudi forces, often accompanied by Wahhabi religious scholars, imposed strict religious policies. Tombs and shrines were destroyed, and practices deemed un-Islamic by Wahhabi doctrine were banned. The campaign caused alarm across the Muslim world, particularly within the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the custodian of the holy sites. ==Ottoman Response and Aftermath== In reaction to the Saudi occupation of the Hejaz, the Ottoman Empire ordered its vassal, Ottoman Egypt who was under the Muhammad Ali Pasha rule, to launch a counter-campaign. In 1811, Egyptian forces under the command of Tusun Pasha began a long and arduous military effort to retake the region. Though the Saudis held the Hejaz for nearly a decade, the Egyptian-Ottoman campaigns eventually forced them out, culminating in the fall of Diriyah in 1818 and the collapse of the First Saudi State aswell as execution of the last First Saudi State, Abdullah bin Saud. ==See Also == Wahhabism Wahhabi war First Saudi state Ottoman Empire == References == * Commins, David. *The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia*.
