It is also the administrative centre of the Ternopil region. The city has about 220,000 inhabitants (2025) and lies on the Siret River. ==History== The city was part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire from 1772 until 1918, and it belonged to Poland before 1772. When the Austrain empire fell in 1918, Turnopil beccame part of the short-lived ZUNR (Western Ukrainian National Republic). After heavy battles between Polish troops and Ukrainian Galician Army troops, the city was occupied by Poland in 1920. However, it was only part of Poland for less than 20 years, and in September 1939, it was taken by Soviet troops and annexed to the USSR. Ternopil became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it became a part of Independent Ukraine. == References == Category:Cities in Ternopil Oblast",
