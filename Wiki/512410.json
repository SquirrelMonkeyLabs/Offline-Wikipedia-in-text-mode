She also is of Romani people descent. ==Music career== Jentina got her first record deal at the age of nineteen. She was working in a computer shop at the time. She then came to fame in 2004 with her first single \"Bad Ass Strippa\". It was a rap song that sampled \"For the Love of Money\" by R&B; group the O'Jays. It reached number twenty two in the UK. Her follow up single \"French Kisses\" was more R&B; than hip hop sounding and reached number twenty. Her third single \"Mysterious\" didn't chart in the UK and was only released in Italy. Her album Jentina was released in Italy in 2005. \"Bad Ass Strippa\" was later sampled and turned into a diss song by fellow female rapper Lady Sovereign called \"Sad Arse Stripah\". ==Modeling career== Apart from being a musician, Jentina was also a model. In November 2007, she modeled for the underwear brand Wonderbra. She was also featured in a jokey video of the chocolate bar Cadbury's Gorilla advert where a gorilla played the drums to a Phil Collins song called \"In The Air Tonight\". ==Personal life== Jentina was born to a Romani family that consisted of fourteen children. When she was one year old, her family moved to West Molesey, Surrey. In 2011, Jentina was on the judging panel for \"Travellers Got Talent\".
