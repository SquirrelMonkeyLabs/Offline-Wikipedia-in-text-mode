 "text": "The coat of arms of Russia (Russian: Герб России/Transkription Gerb rossi) has been used since the year 1993 as the coat of arms of Russia. Since the year 2000 it was defined by court decision as the coat of arms of Russia. It is based on the coat of arms used before the Soviet Union. It has been changed many times, but can be traced back for centuries. ==Objects== ===Double Eagle=== The double eagle was added by Ivan IIII after his marriage with the Byzantine princess Sophia Paleologue. She was the niece of Constantine XI, the last Byzantine Emperor. The double-headed eagle was the symbol of the Byzantine Empire. The orb and scepter held by the eagle are heraldic symbols of sovereign power and autocracy. ===Other part=== The horse's rider is Saint George fighting a dragon. The three crowns were added in 1625. Through time, their meaning has changed. They have been seen as the conquered kingdoms of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia, or as the coming together of 'All the Russias' - Grand Russia (Russia), Little Russia (today's Ukraine) and White Russia (Belarus). In the modern time, they became the symbol for the three parts of government: Executive, legislative and Judiciary. Russia Category:National symbols of Russia",
