 "text": "Nerd is a noun often used as an insult, to describe people who are seen as weird, obsessive or introverted. == Origin == Dr. Seuss created the word \"nerd\" in his 1950 children's book If I Ran the Zoo. In the book, the main character says he'll find fictional animals and put them in an imaginary zoo, including “a Nerkle, a Nerd, and a seersucker too”. By 1951, people were using the word as another for \"square,\" which was a popular insulting slang word at the time, according to a Newsweek article. == Use over time == In 1957, the Sunday Mail in Glasgow, Scotland published an article called “ABCs for squares” explaining slang. It said “nerd” meant “a square. Any explanation needed?” In the 1970, an American magazine called Current Slang said that a “nurd” was “someone with objectionable habits or traits. An uninteresting person. A dud.” Then the word \"nerd\" was routinely used on the television sitcom Happy Days. As a result, use of the word became extremely popular throughout the United States. There were also sketches about nerds on Saturday Night Live. Then, in 1984, a movie called Revenge of the Nerds used comedy for social commentary. A number of fictional characters have been described as nerds, including Dilton Doiley , Peter Parker, Milhouse Van Houten and Hermione Granger. People labeled as nerds tend to be bullied in school more often than others are. ==References== Category:1980s Category:1990s Category:2000s Category:American culture Category:Anthropology Category:Internet culture Category:Lifestyles Category:Pejoratives Category:Slang Category:Subculture",
