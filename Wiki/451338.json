 "text": "Ghoti is an artificial word used to illustrate irregularities in English spelling. It is a respelling of the word fish: i.e., it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈfɪʃ/. It is made of these phonemes: * gh, pronounced /f/ as in tough /tʌf/; * o, pronounced /ɪ/ as in women /ˈwɪmɪn/; * ti, pronounced /ʃ/ as in nation /ˈneɪʃən/ Using the same method, ghoti can be a silent word, where: * gh as in though; the bold letters are not pronounced here and in the next examples. * o as in people; * t as in ballet or mortgage; * I as in business or plaid Ghoti is likely to be spontaneously pronounced [goʊtaɪ] or [gəʊtaɪ] (like \"go\" + \"tie\"), or [goʊti] (\"go\" + \"tea\"), but certainly not like \"fish\" since gh is never pronounced [f] (cf. \"ghost\") at the beginning of a word neither ti is pronounced [ʃ] at the end of a word. Spelling in English is discussed in orthography. Category:Words",
