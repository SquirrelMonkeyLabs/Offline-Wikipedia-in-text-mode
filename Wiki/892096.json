 "text": "Balanced ternary is a type of numbering system with a base of 3. The most common numbering system in use today is decimal. Decimal has a base of ten, so it has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Ternary has a base of three, so it has only 3 digits: 0, 1 and 2. Balanced ternary also has a base of three, but it uses the digits -1, 0 and 1. Like decimal, balanced ternary uses a place value system. Each place value is equal to the previous place value multiplied by the base. In decimal, we have a one's place, a ten's place, a hundred's place, a thousand's place, and so on. In balanced ternary, we have a one's place, a three's place, a nine's place, a twenty-seven's place, and so on. Balanced ternary allows you to write numbers less than zero without needing a dedicated minus sign; if the digit with the biggest place- value is negative, the entire number is negative. Another benefit is that when it comes to computers, there are much fewer rounding errors. == Comparing systems == Most balanced ternary systems use the letter T or the symbol ! for the -1 digit. This article will use the letter T. {| class=\"wikitable\" Base10 Ternary Balanced Ternary B. ternary expanded 1 1 1 1x1 2 2 1t 1x3 + -1x1 3 10 10 1x3 + 0x1 4 11 11 1x3 + 1x1 5 12 1tt 1x9 + -1x3 + -1x1 6 20 1t0 1x9 + -1x3 + 0x1 7 21 1t1 1x9 + -1x3 + 1x1 8 22 10t 1x9 + 0x3 + -1x1 9 100 100 1x9 + 0x3 + 0x1 10 101 101 1x9 + 0x3 + 1x1 Ternary, Balanced",
