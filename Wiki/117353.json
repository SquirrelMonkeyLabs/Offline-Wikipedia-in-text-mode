 "text": "Pokémon (abbreviated from ) is a Japanese anime children's television series. It is part of the Pokémon media franchise which is owned by Nintendo. It has been brought to many other places, including North America, Europe, and Australia. The United States dub was originally made by 4Kids Entertainment; starting in 2006 the dub has been made by Pokémon USA. Not long after Pokémon Red and Blue (the first Pokémon video games outside of Japan) were released, the anime was created. It was first broadcast in Japan in early 1997, and in the United States in late 1998. The anime started what has been called \"Pokémania\", which meant that after the anime came out, it became very popular among children, and many parents assumed it was a fad and no one would care about it in a couple years. However, it was never cancelled, and it is still running, and continues to maintain a fanbase consisting of people of all ages. The anime shows the adventures of Ash Ketchum, a 10-year-old Pokémon trainer and his partner pikachu, who has many adventures, meeting many new people and Pokémon, Ash then leaves the anime and Pokémon Horizons then follows Liko and Roy who also go on adventures to meet people and Pokémon. Pokémon Horizons will release in Australia on 9Go! on February 27th 2024. A number of Pokémon films have also been made that relate to the anime. The first one was Pokémon: The First Movie (released on 1998 in Japan and on 1999 in North America). They are still being made. There are various bad guys in Pokémon like Team Rocket. ==Seasons== Season Season name Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 Pokémon: Indigo League 55 April 1, 1997 May 1, 1999 2 Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands 52 July 9, 1998 September 2, 2000 3 Pokémon: The Johto Journeys 52 July 29, 1999 May 19, 2001 4 Pokémon: Johto League Champions 52 August 3, 2000 September 7, 2002 5 Pokémon: Master Quest 53 August 9, 2001 September 6, 2003 6 Pokémon: Advanced 52 August 29, 2002 September 4, 2004 7 Pokémon: Advanced Challenge 52 September 4, 2003 September 10, 2005 8 Pokémon: Advanced Battle 54 September 9, 2004 July 8, 2006 9 Pokémon: Battle Frontier 47 October 6, 2005 March 3, 2007 10 Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl 52 October 28, 2006 February 1, 2008 11 Pokémon: DP Battle Dimension 52 November 8, 2007 May 2, 2009 12 Pokémon: DP Galactic Battles 53 December 4, 2008 May 15, 2010 13 Pokémon: DP Sinnoh League Victors 34 January 7, 2010 February 5, 2011 14 Pokémon: Black & White 48 September 23, 2010 January 7, 2012 15 Pokémon: BW Rival Destinies 49 September 22, 2011 January 26, 2013 16 Pokémon: BW Adventures in Unova and Beyond 47 October 11, 2012 December 7, 2013 17 Pokémon the Series: XY 48 October 17, 2013 December 20, 2014 18 Pokémon the Series: XY Kalos Quest 45 November 13, 2014 December 19, 2015 19 Pokémon the Series: XYZ 49 October 29, 2015 January 28, 2017 20 Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon 43 November 17, 2016 December 9, 2017 21 Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon - Ultra Adventures 48 October 5, 2017 February 23, 2019 22 Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon - Ultra Legends 54 October 21, 2018 March 7, 2020 23 Pokémon Journeys: The Series 48 November 17, 2019 March 5, 2021 24 Pokémon Master Journeys: The Series 42 December 11, 2020 May 26, 2022 25 Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series 58 December 17, 2021 June 23, 2023 26 Pokémon Horizons: The Series 45 April 14, 2023 TBA === Pokemon the Series: The Beginning (Series 1) === * Pokémon: Indigo League * Pokémon: Adventures on the Orange Islands === Pokemon the Series: Gold and Silver (Series 2) === * Pokémon: The Johto Journeys * Pokémon: Johto League Champions * Pokémon: Master Quest === Pokemon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire (Series 3) === * Pokémon: Advanced * Pokémon: Advanced Challenge * Pokémon: Advanced Battle * Pokémon: Battle Frontier ===Pokémon the Series: Diamond and Pearl (Series 4)=== * Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl * Pokémon: DP Battle Dimension * Pokémon: DP Galactic Battles * Pokémon: DP Sinnoh League Victors ===Pokémon the Series: Black & White (Series 5)=== * Pokémon: Black & White * Pokémon: BW Rival Destinies * Pokémon: BW Adventures in Unova * Pokémon: BW Adventures in Unova and Beyond ===Pokémon the Series: XY (Series 6)=== *Pokémon - The Series: XY *Pokémon - The Series: XY: Kalos Quest *Pokémon - The Series: XYZ === Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon (Series 7) === * Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon * Pokémon the Series Ultra Sun and Moon === Pokémon Journeys (Series 8) === * Pokémon Journeys * Pokémon Master Journeys * Pokémon Ultimate Journeys === Pokémon Horizons (Series 9) === • Pokémon Horizons ===Specials/Spin-offs=== * Pokémon: Chronicles * Pokémon: Origins * Pokémon: Twilight Wings ==Movies== ===Pokémon Feature Movies=== # Japanese Title Japanese release English Title English release 1 July 18, 1998 Pokémon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back November 10, 1999 2 July 17, 1999 Pokémon: The Movie 2000 - The Power of One July 21, 2000 3 July 8, 2000 Pokémon 3: The Movie - Spell of the Unown April 6, 2001 4 July 7, 2001 Pokémon 4Ever - Celebi: Voice of the Forest October 11, 2002 5 July 13, 2002 Pokémon Heroes - Latios and Latias May 16, 2003 6 July 19, 2003 Pokémon: Jirachi: Wish Maker June 1, 2004 7 July 17, 2004 Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys January 22, 2005 8 July 16, 2005 Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew September 19, 2006 9 July 15, 2006 Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea March 23, 2007 10 July 14, 2007 Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai February 24, 2008 11 July 19, 2008 Pokémon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior February 13, 2009 12 July 18, 2009 Pokémon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life November 20, 2009 13 July 10, 2010 Pokémon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions February 5, 2011 14 July 16, 2011 Pokémon the Movie: White—Victini and Zekrom December 3, 2011 July 16, 2011 Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram December 10, 2011 15 July 14, 2012 Pokémon the Movie: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice December 8, 2012 16 July 13, 2013 Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened October 19, 2013 17 July 19, 2014 Pokémon the Movie: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction November 8, 2014 18 July 18, 2015 Pokémon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages December 19, 2015 19 July 16, 2016 Pokémon the Movie: Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel December 5, 2016 20 July 15, 2017 Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!
