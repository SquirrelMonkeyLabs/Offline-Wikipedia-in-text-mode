The missile hit and destroyed a radar facility at the Houthi- controlled al-Dailami Air Base in Yemen. This was done as a “follow-on action” to the large scale missile strikes conducted by a United States-United Kingdom-led coalition the day before. == Related pages == * List of military operations during 2024 * 12 January 2024 missile strikes against Yemen * 9 January 2024 Houthi attacks ==References== Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Houthi Movement Category:January 2024 events Category:Red Sea crisis",
