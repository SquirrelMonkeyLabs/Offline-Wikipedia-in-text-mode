 "text": "Adipic acid (called hexanedioic acid in IUPAC nomenclature) is an organic chemical compound with the chemical formula . It is used to make nylon and other polymers. Adipic acid was discovered by Auguste Laurent in 1836. Laurent first made the compound from fat, and the name \"adipic acid\" comes from the Latin word adeps, meaning animal fat. == Chemistry == Adipic acid is a type of chemical called a dicarboxylic acid, meaning it has two functional groups. These groups make it an acid, and it will react with bases to form salts called adipates. The two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite ends of the main hexane structure. These two groups are what makes adipic acid useful in making polymers. When combined with another chemical with a similar structure, but with basic functional groups instead of acids, adipic acid forms a chain of alternating parts that form one very long molecule. If the other molecule has two alcohol groups, it makes a polyester; if it has two amine groups, it makes a polyamide. The reaction between adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine to make nylon is an important example of this reaction. == Production == Adipic acid is made from cyclohexanol, or a mixture of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone called KA oil, by oxidation with nitric acid. == References ==",
