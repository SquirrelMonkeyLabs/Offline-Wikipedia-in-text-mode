 "text": "Bikram Ahir was an Indian freedom fighter, farmer, and wrestler from Bale village, Gorakhpur district, Uttar Pradesh. He played a crucial role in India’s independence movement and was actively involved in the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–21). He joined the Congress Volunteer Corps and participated in organizing public meetings and demonstrations, urging people to stop paying land revenue and taxes as a form of resistance against British rule. == Early Life and Wrestling Legacy == Bikram Ahir was known for his exceptional wrestling skills and was a prominent figure hailing from a Gwalbansi Ahir family in the Dumari Akhara, a traditional wrestling arena in his region. His physical strength and influence made him a respected leader in his community. He trained and wrestled alongside his son Neur Ahir and his brother Suryabali Ahir, both of whom were also well-known wrestlers. His reputation as a wrestler and leader contributed to his growing influence in the fight for independence. == Role == On February 4, 1922, Bikram Ahir took part in a hartal (strike) organized in protest against the oppressive policies of British rule. The protest took a violent turn when the British police brutally assaulted Bhagwan Ahir, a fellow freedom fighter and volunteer. In response, thousands of protesters, including Bikram Ahir, gathered outside the Chaura Police Station. As tensions escalated, the police opened fire on the unarmed crowd, killing several demonstrators. Enraged by the violence, the protestors retaliated by setting fire to the Chaura police station, resulting in the deaths of 23 policemen. The British government responded with a harsh crackdown, arresting 273 people, including Bikram Ahir. He was later sentenced to death along with 18 other revolutionaries. Despite appeals for clemency, he was executed on the gallows, sacrificing his life for the country’s freedom. ==Legacy== Bikram Ahir remains a revered figure in the history of India’s freedom struggle, particularly in Uttar Pradesh. His bravery and sacrifice in the Chaura Chauri Incident were a turning point in India’s fight against British rule, leading Mahatma Gandhi to halt the Non-Cooperation Movement. His legacy as both a freedom fighter and a wrestler continues to inspire generations in his native region and beyond. == References == Category:1923 deaths Category:Indian criminals Category:People from Uttar Pradesh",
