There are 3 colours for warnings yellow,amber & red. In northeastern England in late 2021, a red warning was issued for a storm named Arwen, which brung winds of 145 km/h (90 mph) & caused devastation across this region of England by the coast. Again they issued more red warnings for one storm in 2022, Storm Eunice which again brought winds of 145 km/h around East coasts. Earlier in that week Storm Dudley also hit mostly Scotland. Year 2020 was stormy in many months, particularly February when as much as 3 storms hit, Ciara, Dennis, & Jorge. All of them brought devastation to many communities. There were storms multiple times over the last few years. These are just examples of when weather warnings get issued. ==Other websites== * Latest UK weather warnings Category:United Kingdom Category:Weather services",
