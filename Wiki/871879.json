 "text": "The orange-legged leaf frog (Pithecopus hypochondrialis) is a frog that lives in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and the Guianas. People have seen it as high as 1500 meters above sea level. This frog hides during the day and moves at night. People have seen it sitting on shrubs and other plants in forests and in grasslands that are covered with water for part of the year. The male frog sits near ponds that dry up for part of the year and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over the water. The tadpoles fall into the water after they hatch. Scientists have seen some of these frogs in cities. Human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down forests to make farms and to let cows eat grass. There are also problems with fire. Some people have caught the frog to sell as pets. But because this frog can live in cities, it is not in danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
