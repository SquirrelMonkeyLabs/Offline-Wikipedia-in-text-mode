The tin is in its +4 oxidation state. ==Properties== Tin(IV) fluoride is a colorless solid. Its melting point is very high. It reacts with alkali metal fluorides like potassium fluoride to make hexafluorostannates, compounds that have the SnF62- ion in them. ==Preparation== Tin(IV) fluoride is made by reacting tin and fluorine. It can also be made by reacting hydrogen fluoride with tin(IV) chloride. ==Uses== It is sometimes used in toothpaste, although tin(II) fluoride is more common. ==Related pages== *Tin(IV) bromide *Tin(IV) iodide *Tin(IV) oxide Category:Tin compounds Category:Fluorine compounds",
