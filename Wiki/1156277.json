 "text": "The three-striped rocket frog (Allobates trilineatus) is a frog. It lives in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. ==Body== The adult male frog can be 15.0-17-7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be 15.2-19.3 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color. The male frog has a gray throat with spots. There are two stripes down each side of the body (four stripes). The sides of the body are dark brown in color. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the dead leaves on the ground in tropical forests. People have seen it in places where people cut down some trees but not all of them. Scientists saw the frog between 100 and 250 meters above sea level. This frog lives in many protected parks, for example Parque Nacional Manu, Bahuaja-Sonene National Park, Tambopata Reserve, and Pacaya Samiria Reserve. Scientists think it could also live in Yasuni National Park, Área de Proteção Ambiental Igarapé São Francisco, Estação Ecológica Rio Acre, Reserva Biológica Limoncocha, Floresta Nacional do Macaua, Parque Nacional da Serra do Divisor, Parque Nacional Mapinguari, and Reserva Extrativista Arapixi. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water, where the tadpoles swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans do change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
