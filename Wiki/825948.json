The adult male frog is 18 to 20 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 22 to 23 mm long. The eyes stick out from the head. The nose is round. This frog has vomerine teeth in its jaw. All four feet are webbed. They have discs on their toes for climbing, but they do not climb very high into the trees. This frog lives near water, for example places that have been flooded. This frog can live near farms that human beings have left. The female lays eggs on top of the water, near plants. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
