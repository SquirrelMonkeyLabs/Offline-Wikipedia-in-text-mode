 "text": "The Labour Party is the main centre-left political party in the United Kingdom. It is a social democratic party. It has been one of the UK's two main political parties from the early 20th century to the present day. It is the largest party in the British House of Commons, with 412 out of 650 seats. It forms the Goverment. The current Labour Party leader and Prime minister is Sir Keir Starmer, who took over in April 2020 from Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour Party has been in power in the United Kingdom government since July 2024. It was in power in the Scottish Parliament (in coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats) until 2007. It is the largest group in the London Assembly, although until May 2016 the Mayor of London was a Conservative party member. It is also the largest party in local government. == History == The party was officially formed in 1906, just after the general election, as a successor of the Labour Representative Committee formed in 1900. In 1918, the party made a new constitution with the commitment to socialism, or the socialization of the industry. This could be found in Clause 4. The Labour Party won the general election in 1945 for the first time. From 1951 Labour was in opposition for thirteen years, during which there were serious fights between the left and right wings of the party. The leader of the left wing was Aneurin Bevan. His supporters were called the \"Bevanites\". They wanted a less confrontational policy in foreign affairs and more socialist actions. The leaders of the right wing were Clement Attlee and Hugh Gaitskell. They believed that Western capitalism had changed a lot and that socialism and public ownership was not so important. Gaitskell tried to remove Clause 4 from the party constitution at the 1959 conference, but he could not. In 1994, Tony Blair forced the Labour Party to drop Clause 4. This was an important step to change the party into \"New Labour\". In 2015, dark horse candidate Jeremy Corbyn announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Labour Party. At the beginning, he was thought of as a socialist fringe candidate, but he later became the lead candidate in polls and got the support of the majority of trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party, along with those of three non-affiliated unions. On 12 September 2015, he was elected Leader of the Labour Party, with a majority vote of 59.5% in the first round of the ballot. === Past Leaders (since 1906) === *Keir Hardie, 1906–1908 *Arthur Henderson, 1908–1910 *George Nicoll Barnes, 1910–1911 *Ramsay MacDonald, 1911–1914 *Arthur Henderson, 1914–1917 *William Adamson, 1917–1921 *John Robert Clynes, 1921–1922 *Ramsay MacDonald, 1922–1931 *Arthur Henderson, 1931–1932 *George Lansbury, 1932–1935 *Clement Attlee, 1935–1955 *Hugh Gaitskell, 1955–1963 *George Brown, 1963 (Acting) *Harold Wilson, 1963–1976 *James Callaghan, 1976–1980 *Michael Foot, 1980–1983 *Neil Kinnock, 1983–1992 *John Smith, 1992–1994 *Margaret Beckett, 1994 (Acting) *Tony Blair, 1994–2007 *Gordon Brown, 2007–2010 *Harriet Harman, 2010 (Acting) *Ed Miliband, 2010–2015 *Harriet Harman, 2015 (Acting) *Jeremy Corbyn, 2015–2020 *Keir Starmer, 2020–present ==Labour Prime Ministers== Name Portrait Country of birth Time in Office Ramsay MacDonald Scotland 1924; 1929–1931 Clement Attlee England 1945–1951 Harold Wilson England 1964–1970; 1974–1976 James Callaghan England 1976–1979 Tony Blair Scotland 1997–2007 Gordon Brown Scotland 2007–2010 Keir Starmer England 2024-present ==References== ==Notes== == Other websites == *Official Labour Party website *Unofficial website with an archive of electoral manifestos and a directory of related websites *Unofficial history website *Guardian Unlimited Politics — Special Report: Labour Party Category:1900 establishments in the United Kingdom",
