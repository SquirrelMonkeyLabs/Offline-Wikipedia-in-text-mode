 "text": "Chupa is a Spanish confectionery brand which was started in 1958. Enric Bernat had the idea of caramel on a stick because many children ate a lot of caramels and this caused their hands to get dirty. The company had much success. Chupa Chups was sold outside of Spain in the 1970s. It now does business in over 150 countries. These include Russia, Japan, Germany, Mexico, Australia and the United States. Chupa Chups began with seven flavours. This number has grown since then. The logo of the company is a daisy with the name of the company inside. It was designed by Salvador Dal√≠ in 1969. In July 2006, the company as a whole was acquired by the Italian-Dutch company Perfetti Van Melle. ==References== == Other websites == * Chupa Chups site Category:1958 establishments in Europe Category:1950s establishments in Spain Category:Manufacturing companies of Spain Category:Food companies of Europe",
