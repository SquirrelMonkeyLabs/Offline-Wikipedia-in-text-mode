 "text": "Sophia Magdalena Scholl (9 May 1921 – 22 February 1943) was a member of the White Rose Resistance group. Along with Hans scholl, Alexander Schmorell, Willi Graf, Christoph Probst, and Kurt Huber, Sophie helped write leaflets that opposed Hitler and Nazi Germany. On February 18,1943, Sophie and her brother went to the Munich University to pass out leaflets. They were spotted by a custodian, who alerted the Gestapo. They were put on trial on February 22. They were sentenced to death. Before her death, her roommate, Else Gebel, recalls the last thing that Sophie said to her: “How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone wiling to give himself up individually for a righteous cause? Such a fine, sunny, day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter, if through us, thousands of lives are awakened and stirred into action.”. She was killed the same day of the trial, February 22, 1943. ==References== ==Other websites== *The Geschwister-Scholl-Institut *Court documents and testimonies (Center for White Rose Studies *Sophie Scholl's childhood years in Ludwigsburg *The Line, a comic that compares and contrasts Sophie Scholl and Traudl Junge * * Weiße Rose Stiftung e.V.
