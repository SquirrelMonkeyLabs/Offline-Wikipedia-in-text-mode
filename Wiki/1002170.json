 "text": "Alex Katz (July 24, 1927) is an American artist. Katz was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1927 and raised in Queens, New York. He went to school at Woodrow Wilson Vocational High School. That school let him make art much of the time. In 1946 he studied art at Cooper Union in New York City. After that, in the summers of 1949 and 1950, he went to the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture in Maine. In the mid-1950s he bought a house in Lincolnville, Maine. He had his first art show in 1954. He was friends with many poets in New York, such as Frank O’Hara, James Schuyler, Kenneth Koch, John Ashbery, and Edwin Denby. Many creative people are in his paintings, such as choreographer Paul Taylor, Denby, O’Hara, Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, Ted Berrigan, the filmmaker Rudy Burckhardt, and the dancer Bill T. Jones. From 2022 to 2023, the Guggenheim Museum showed a large range of Katz's art from his whole career. It was called \"Alex Katz: Gathering.\" ==References== Category:1927 births Category:Living people Category:American painters",
