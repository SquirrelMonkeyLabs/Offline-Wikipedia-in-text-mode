 "text": "The Tasmanian tree frog or Burrow's tree frog (Litoria burrowsae) is a frog from Tasmania. They live in high grasslands and forests near ponds and dams. Adult frogs are 60 mm long from nose to rear end, green with brown marks. They lay eggs in groups on underwater plants in still water or water that only moves slowly. The eggs take 6 days to hatch. In 2018 and 2019, scientists from the Australian Museum asked people in Tasmania to go outside and record frog calls on their phones using FrogID in a citizen science project. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
