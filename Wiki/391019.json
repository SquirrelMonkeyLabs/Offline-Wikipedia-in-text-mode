His ministry reaches over seven million broadcast media viewers weekly in over 100 nations around the world. His first book, “Your Best Life Now” has sold 5 million copies. Lakewood Church now occupies the former Compaq Center, once home to the NBA’s Houston Rockets. The venue seats 16,000 people. Osteen was born on March 5, 1963 in Houston, Texas. He has been married to Victoria Osteen since 1987. They have two children. He lives in Houston, Texas. In August 2017, Osteen received significant backlash on social media after he did not initially open Lakewood Church as an emergency shelter following Hurricane Harvey. A post on the church's Facebook page and an Instagram post by associate pastor John Gray, which was later deleted, claimed that flooded highways had made the church inaccessible. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Joel Osteen Ministries Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American Pentecostals Category:Christian religious leaders Category:American Christian writers Category:Television evangelists Category:Television personalities from Texas Category:Writers from Houston",
