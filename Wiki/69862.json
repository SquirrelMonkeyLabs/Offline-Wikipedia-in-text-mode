 "text": "Pachycephalosaurus was a genus of dinosaur which lived during the last five million years of the Upper Cretaceous. It lived in what is now North America. Giffin, Emily B; Gabriel, Diane L; Johnson Rolf E. 1988. A new Pachycephalosaurid: Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 7 (4): 398â€“407. This member of the Pachycephalosaurid family is known from a single skull and a few thick skull roofs. From this it is estimated that its length was about 4.5 to 5 metres long (about 15 feet). Pachycephalosaurus was a herbivore. It lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruit. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants. == References == Category:Pachycephalosauria",
