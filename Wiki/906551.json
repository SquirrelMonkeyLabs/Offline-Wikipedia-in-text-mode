His reign ended during the 5 October 1910 revolution. Manuel lived the rest of his life in exile in Twickenham, Middlesex, England. His short reign was an average for a monarch at that time. He sometimes had to even put down rebellions,though. ==References== category:1889 births category:1932 deaths Category:Kings and Queens of Portugal",
