 "text": "The Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) was the primary state-owned rail operator for Western Australia. The WAGR originated from the Department of Works and Railways created to run the Northern Railway between Geraldton and Northampton when it opened in 1879. In 1890 the Works and Railways department was replaced with the WAGR, which would continue under that name until 1975 when its trading name changed to Westrail until 2000, with the WAGR being taken over by the Public Transport Authority in 2003 under the name Transwa. In 1986 inner-city suburban lines were handed over to the newly established Transperth. In addition to rail services, the WAGR also operated trams, and ferries and provided electricity during its tenure, being renamed several times to reflect what it was doing. ==Origins of WAGR== The history of the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) dates back to 1879 when the Department of Works & Railways was established. The first railway line operated by WAGR opened on July 26, 1879, connecting Geraldton and Northampton. Subsequently, the Eastern Railway from Fremantle to Guildford via Perth was launched on March 1, 1881. The WAGR chose a narrow gauge of 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) to reduce construction costs. Over the following decades, WAGR expanded its network with main lines and branches to serve Western Australia's wheatbelt. Before road transport became prevalent, the railway network played a vital role in transporting agricultural, forestry, and mining products. In 1890, the Department of Works & Railways was replaced by the WAGR and the Department of Works & Buildings. In October 1917, the WAGR network was connected to the rest of mainland Australia through the Commonwealth Railways' Trans-Australian Railway, which used a different standard gauge of 4 ft 8+1‚ÅÑ2 in (1,435 mm) to reach Kalgoorlie. ==Challenges and Changes== Legislation was introduced to limit competition from road transport, primarily during the 1930s to the 1950s, with the Transport Co-ordination Board controlling commercial road traffic. As road transport expanded, many railway lines closed from 1949. The railway network reached its peak at 6,600 kilometers in 1937, with only one tunnel, the Swan View Tunnel, being constructed. In the 1950s, many branches closed due to maintenance needs, aging rolling stock, and financial losses. Although 1,320 kilometers of the network were closed in 1956/57, 275 kilometers were later reopened on a seasonal basis. During the late 1960s, gauge conversion allowed trains from eastern states to operate on the Eastern and Eastern Goldfields lines between Perth and Kalgoorlie. Diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives in March 1972. In the late 20th century, the removal of restrictions on road transport competition shifted WAGR from a customer-oriented system to primarily a main line bulk carrier operation. This resulted in the closure of facilities in smaller communities, except for the wheatbelt, where bulk grain handling continued despite the changes. ==Operational History== === Rolling Stock === ==== Locomotives ==== Listed in chronological order of service entry with subclasses. ===== Steam ===== * M class (1876) * E class (1879) * A class (1880) * C class (1881) * D class (1884) * B class (1886) * G class (1889) * H class (1889) * I class (1891) * J class (1891) - Ja * F class (1893) * K class (1893) - Ks * L class (1894) * Q class (1895) - Qa * N class (1896) - Ns * O class (1896) - Oa, Oas, Ob, Os * P class (1896) * S class (1896) * T class (1896) * R class (1897) - Ra * C class (1902) - Ca, Cs * Ec class (1901) - Eca * E class (1902) - Ea, Eas, Es, Esl, Eso * F class (1902) - Fs, Fsl, Fso * U class (1904) * D class (1912) - Ds * M class (1912) - Ms * L class (1924) * P class (1924) * Msa class (1930) * Q class (1931) * Pr class (1938) * S class (1943) * Asg class (1944) * Dm class (1945) * Dd class (1946) * U class (1946) - Ut * Pm class (1950) - Pmr * W class (1951) * V class (1955) ===== Diesel ===== * Y class (1953) * Z class (1953) * X class (1954) - Xa, Xb * A class (1960) - Aa, Ab * B class (1962) * C class (1962) * E class (1964) * F class (1964) * G class (1964) * H class (1964) * J class (1966) * K class (1966) - Ka * L class (1967) - Lw * T class (1967) - Ta * R class (1968) - Ra * D class (1971) - Da, Db * M class (1972) - Ma * N class (1977) - Na, Nb * P class (1989) * Q class (1997) * S class (1998) ===== Railcars and Multiple Units ===== * AO/AOT class (1922) * ASA class (1931) * AI class (1937) * ADE/ADT class (1937/39) * ADF/ADU class (1949) * ADG class (1954) * ADH class (1955, '62) * ADX class (1959) * ADK/ADB class (1968) * WCA/WCE class (1971) * ADL/ADC class (1982) * ADP/ADQ class (1987) * AEA/AEB class (1991) - Transperth A-series * WDA/WDB/WDC class (2004) * WEA/WEB class (2004) * BEA/BEB/BET class (2005) - Transperth B-series * Transperth C-series (2023) ==== Carriages ==== * AI class (1876) (Originally AB class) * AH class (1881/83) (Originally AC, BC classes) * AG class (1884) (Originally AB, ABA classes) * Unclassed (1887) - Bunbury Tramcars * AH class (1888) (Originally ABC class) * AC class (1892) (Originally AB class) * AG class (1893) (Originally AB class) \\- Gilbert coaches * AD class (1895) (Originally AB class) \\- ADS * AC class (1895) (Originally AB class) \\- ACE * AB class (1895) * AM class (1895) * AP class (1896) (Originally A class) * AC class (1896) (Originally AB class) \\- Ex-GSR * AL class (1896) (Originally A class) * AE class (1897) (Originally AB class) * AF class (1897) (Originally AB class) * AA class (1899) (Originally A class) * AB class (1899) (Originally A class) * AO class (1899) * AR class (1903) * AQ class (1904) * AT class (1904) * AW class (1905) * AU class (1905) * AV class (1905) * ACL class (1906) * AX class (1906) * AS class (1908) * AR class (1911) - ARS * AGB class (1921) * AZ class (1928) * AY class (1928) - AYL * AG class (1928) * ACW class (1933) * AGS class (1935) * AJ class (1941) * AG class (1941) * VP class (1942) * AK class (1942) * AYB class (1945) * AYC class (1947) * AYD class (1947) * AH class (1948) * AJB class (1950) * AKB class (1950) * AQZ class (1954) * AYE class (1955) * AN class (1955) * AVL class (1958) * ADA class (1961) * AQL class (1961) * AQM class (1961) * ARM class (1962) * AYS class (1962) * AYU class (1964) * ACM class (1965) * AYF class (1967) * ARA class (1980) * SX class (1986) - SXV ==== Wagons ==== Note: This section is incomplete.
