 "text": "Prophylaxis is a Greek word and concept. It means any action taken to guard or prevent beforehand. The corresponding adjective is prophylactic. == Two parts == The concept of prophylaxis has two parts. First is forethought. A person has to realise the need first of all. Second is taking appropriate action. Any failure of prophylaxis is a failure at either stage 1 or stage 2. Successful prophylaxis means one has anticipated and avoided some undesirable outcome. == Examples == === Preventative medicine === Prophylaxis is the central idea in preventative medicine. People usually think medical treatment helps sick people to get healthy. Prophylactic treatment is helpful in a different way. Primary prophylaxis tries to stop healthy people from getting sick. Secondary prophylaxis tries to stop people who are sick from getting worse. === Birth control === Prophylaxis is also be used as a synonym for birth control. Condoms are prophylactic, because when used properly they can prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. == Related pages == *Epidemiology *Health care *Prophylaxis (chess) *Vaccine Category:Medicine",
