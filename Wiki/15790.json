 "text": "Bangladesh, officially called the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth most populated country in the world and one of the most tightly packed, with more than 170 million people living in an area of . Bangladesh has land borders with India on the north, west, and east, and Myanmar on the southeast. In the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. In the north, the Siliguri Corridor separates it from Bhutan and Nepal, and the Indian state of Sikkim separates it from China. Dhaka is the capital and the biggest city. It is also the center of politics, money, and culture. Chittagong is the second biggest city and the busiest port. Bengali is the official language. Islam is the official and biggest religion, and Bengali Muslims are the largest group of people in the country. Bangladesh is part of the old region of Bengal, which was split during the Partition of British India in 1947. It became the eastern part of Pakistan. Long ago, Bengal was called Gangaridai and had powerful kingdoms before Islam. After 1204, Muslim rulers took control, and Bengal became important under the Bengal Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. Bengal was rich and important in trade and politics. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 started British rule, which lasted for 200 years. In 1905, Eastern Bengal and Assam were created, which later led to the making of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League was formed in Dhaka in 1906. In 1940, A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal, suggested a separate Bengali Muslim land in the Lahore Resolution. The current border was set by the Radcliffe Line. In 1947, East Bengal became the most crowded part of Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan. Dhaka became its capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, a military takeover in 1958, and the 1970 general election led to strong Bengali nationalism and demands for democracy. The Pakistan military refused to give power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This started the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini fought and won, and the war included the genocide of Bangladeshis. On 16 December 1971, Pakistan surrendered, and Bangladesh became independent after a 9-month war. After the war, Sheikh Mujib became the leader. He was killed in 1975, and then Ziaur Rahman took power. He was also killed in 1981. In the 1980s, Hussain Muhammad Ershad ruled until he was removed in 1990 by mass protests. After 1990, Bangladesh’s politics was mostly controlled by a power struggle between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, known as the \"Battle of the Begums.\" In August 2024, students led protests that removed Hasina from power, and Muhammad Yunus became the interim leader. Bangladesh is a country with a single government and follows the Westminster system. It has the second biggest economy in South Asia. It has the third biggest Muslim population in the world and the fifth most spoken first language. Bangladesh has the third biggest military in South Asia and sends the most soldiers to UN peacekeeping missions. The country has eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 sub- districts. It has the world’s largest mangrove forest. But Bangladesh also has one of the biggest refugee populations and faces problems like corruption, political troubles, too many people, and climate change. Bangladesh has twice led the Climate Vulnerable Forum and is home to the BIMSTEC headquarters. It is a founding member of SAARC and also a member of the OIC and the Commonwealth of Nations. ==History== For much of its history, Bangladesh was simply the eastern part of Bengal and was considered a part of India.Stuart Butler, Bangladesh (Footscray, VIC; London: Lonely Planet, 2008), p. 19 The Bengal delta has been ruled by Hindu rulers, Muslim rulers, and the British empire. People have lived in Bangladesh for thousands of years.Meghna Guhathakurta; Willem van Schendel, The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics (Durham, NC; London: Duke University Press, 2013), p. 31 Farming developed in Bangladesh very early on. By 500 BC, people grew rice there. Farming lead to the development of urban areas like cities. Early houses in Bangladesh were likely built of wood and mud, and adobe. Because Bangladesh has monsoons, there is not a lot of evidence of ancient people living there. From about 300 BC to the 1700s AD, technology like writing and the Bengali language developed. During this time, many religions were popular and many states were founded. By the 1500s, the area was rich and even peasants had plenty to eat.Salahuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh: Past and Present (New Delhi: A.P.H. Publishing Corporation, 2003), p. 1 === Bengal under Mughal rule === In the 13th century, Turkic armies took over the Bengal delta. During this time, the delta was ruled by Hindu leaders. In 1202, the last major Hindu Sen leader was pushed out from his capital in Western Bengal(Nadiya), but they stayed for a short time in East Bengal. In 1206, a Muslim kingdom called the Delhi Sultanate was founded. The rulers of the Bengal delta became friendly with the sultanate, and to stay separately ruled the Bengal rulers would pay tribute to the sultanate using war elephants. In 1341, Bengal became independent from Delhi, and Dhaka became the capital of independent Bengal. In 1576, Bengal was taken over by Akbar the Great, a Mughal emperor. Bengal stayed part of the Mughal Empire until the eighteenth century. When the Mughals ruled the Bengal, they began to make Bengal part of India politically. Bengal, however, was too far away from the Mughal capital in Delhi. Because it was hard to talk to Bengal, local governors found it easy to ignore what the Mughals wanted for Bengal. Although Bengal remained a province, religious leaders and scientists from Mughal-ruled Bengal have been famous throughout India. As Bengal was part of their empire, the Mughals helped it grow. They built a road from Delhi to Dhaka, started a postal service, and helped make their calendar better. This calendar is still used in Bangladesh today. The Mughals also collected taxes in Bengal. Soon, Bengal was the richest province and was called the \"Breadbasket of India\". The Mughals used Bengali resources to help maintain their army, but they did not help protect the Bengali people from pirates. This made the Bengali people angry, and the Mughals had to appoint powerful generals to help rule Bengal. Despite this, Bengal became a center of the textile trade in South Asia. In 1704, the capital of Bengal was moved from Dhaka to Murshidabad. In 1707, Aurangzeb, sometimes called the last great Mughal emperor, died. After this, governors in Bengal still paid tribute to the Mughal empire, but were mostly left alone. These governors protected Bengal from Hindu Marathas during the eighteenth century. When the Mughal governor Alivardi Khan died in 1756, he left rule of Bengal to his grandson, who would lose Bengal to the British in 1757. === Bengal under British rule === Bengal was under British rule from 1757 to 1947.Junie T Tong, Finance and Society in 21st Century China: Chinese Culture versus Western Markets (Farnham, Surrey; Burlington, VT: Gower, 2011), p. 151 It was part of British India. English was made one of the official languages of the Bengal Presidency. === Bengal as East Pakistan === In 1947, East Bengal and the Dominion of Pakistan were separated from India, becoming Pakistan. Pakistan was cut in half, its east and west parts separated by 930 miles (1,500 km) of India. In 1949, the Bangladesh Awami League formed, wanting the east and west parts of Pakistan separated. In 1955, East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan, with Dacca becoming the capital. The people living in East Pakistan were mostly ethnically Bengali, spoke Bengali, and had a different culture compared to the people of western Pakistan. These differences eventually led to the Bangladesh Liberation War. === Independence from Pakistan === Bangladesh declared itself as independent from Pakistan in 1971 after a liberation war in which over a million people died. After Indian military intervention, the provisional government returned from exile in Calcutta, Bengal (India). After the Instrument of Surrender, the Bengali peoples became a sovereign nation. After Bangladesh became independent, Bengali replaced Urdu and English as the only national and official language. Bengali is used in government, business, and schools. Private English-language schools for upper-class students existed into the 1980s. English is now taught in higher education and is offered as a university subject. At first, people began to stop speaking Arabic in Bangladesh. In 1983, after Bangladesh strengthened its ties with Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich countries, people tried to make Arabic a required language to learn in school. Arabic is widely studied today in Madrassas and Islamic schools so people can understand Islamic texts better. Despite gaining independence in 1971, Bangladesh is a poor country and has problems with political corruption. Presently, more than 75% the population can read and write. === 2024 Quota Reform Movement === During Sheikh Hasina's tenure until 2024, her regime had been criticized under so many accusations including money laundering, enforced disappearances, lack of press freedom, Extrajudicial killing and constantly described as an authoritarian and dictatorial. This caused the public to build up tension against the government. In June-July, a court ruling was announced, illegalized the 2018 ruling which had banned the previous 2018 quota system for jobs. Respectively, the 2018 quota system was back on, and the students of Bangladesh felt they had less opportunities to earn jobs based on merit, as the quota system took up 56% of the total job seats. The main issue began when the total reserved seats for freedom fighters were increased to 30%. Following that, the students (primarily University students) had spoken up against the controversial Quota system and demanded to reduce the total quota percentage to 5-10%. However the government responded violently, which ultimately led students demanding the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and her cabinet. After this, the movement evolved to what many know as \"The Mass Uprising\" which led Sheikh Hasina in August 5 to resign and flee to India. After the fall of Hasina, an interim government was formed in August 8 with Dr. Muhammad Yunus, acting as the Chief Advisor of the interim government. ==Politics== The President of Bangladesh acts as Head of state, but the Prime Minister of Bangladesh acts as Head of government. The president is elected by lawmakers every 5 years, and has limited powers. The presidency is largely ceremonial, but sometimes the president has do more than usual. This is called a Caretaker government. The prime minister is chosen by the president and must be a member of parliament (MP). The Cabinet is made up of people chosen by the prime minister, and is appointed by the president. Bangladesh's parliament is called the House of the Nation, or the Jatiya Sangsad, and has only one chamber. The Jatiya Sangsad has 300 members who are elected by popular vote, and they have 5-year terms of office. The highest judiciary body in Bangladesh is the Supreme Court, whose members are chosen by the president. After famines in 1973 and 1974, the prime minister of Bangladesh instituted a one-party socialist state. After this, a military junta ruled Bangladesh until 1990. Since then, Bangladesh has become a parliamentary democracy. In 2007, a caretaker government was appointed to help end corruption in Bangladeshi politics. Many politicians were arrested on corruption charges. Again in 2008, Bangladesh came under a parliamentary rule. Currently, Bangladesh is a totalitarian dictatorship with a comprehensive cult of personality around the Sheikh family. ==Geography== Bangladesh is in the Ganges Delta.
