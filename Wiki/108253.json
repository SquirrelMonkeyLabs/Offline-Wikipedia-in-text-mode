Because Suu Kyi was working against the government, she was asked to leave the country, but she did not. She was arrested in 1989 and placed in prison in 1990. This was after an election which her party, the National League for Democracy, won, but they were not allowed to be in charge of the country. Between 1990 and 2010, she was almost always in her home, which is called house arrest. Burma released her in November 2010. Suu Kyi was going to be released in 2009, but when a man entered her home she was kept on house arrest for another year because she had broken the rules of the house arrest. After she was released from house arrest, she was elected to be State Counsellor. When she was State Counsellor, Burma had serious problems with the genocide of the Rohingya. ==Political belief== When she was asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: \"We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia and Indonesia\". She also cited \"the eastern European countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the Latin American countries, which made the transition from military governments\". She added that \"we wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also (...) because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid.\"Myanmar's Suu Kyi ends US trip, hailing democracy, AFP, Oct 3, 2012 == Book == === Authored === * Letters from Burma (1998) with Fergal Keane * The Voice of Hope (1998) with Alan Clements, * Freedom from Fear and Other Writings (1995) with Václav Havel, Desmond M.
