 "text": "Gallium arsenide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is . It has gallium and arsenide atoms in it. The gallium is in the +3 oxidation state. ==Properties== Gallium arsenide is a gray solid. It makes crystals in a cube shape. It reacts slowly with water and quickly with acids to make arsine. It oxidizes in air. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting arsenic trichloride or arsenic with gallium. ==Uses== Gallium arsenide is mainly used as a semiconductor. It has several things better about it than silicon. The semiconductors made are faster and higher power. LED's using gallium arsenide are efficient. Silicon, though is cheaper. Silicon dioxide is a good insulator; gallium arsenide does not make a good insulator like silicon does. Silicon semiconductors also take less power than gallium arsenide ones. ==Related pages== *Aluminium arsenide *Gallium(III) oxide Category:Arsenic compounds Category:Gallium compounds Category:Semiconductors",
