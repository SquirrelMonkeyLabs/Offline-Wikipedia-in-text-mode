With this victory, Vienna qualified for the 1943/44 German football championship. They reached the quarter-finals. The SK Amateure Steyr ended the game prematurely on April 20, 1944 with 3 points from 14 games. The games that had already been played were then canceled. The club merged with SK Vorwärts Steyr to form FC Steyr and played in the 1st class Oberdonau in the remaining time. LSV Markersdorf was dissolved at the end of the season. So the last of the table, Wiener Sport-Club, was not relegated. ==Table== Pl. Name M W D L P 1\\. First Vienna FC 16 13 1 2 27 2\\. Floridsdorfer AC 16 9 4 3 22 3\\. Wiener AC 16 7 2 7 16 4\\.
