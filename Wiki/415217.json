He ruled from 1035 to his death and was one of the most powerful counts in France at the time. == Early career == He was the son of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, and his first wife, Ogive of Luxembourg.Detlev Schwennicke, Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band II (Marburg, Germany: J. A. Stargardt, 1984), Tafel 5 She was a daughter of Frederick of Luxembourg.Richard Mylius Sherman, The Ghents: A Flemish Family in Norman England, UMI Dissertation Information Service, Ann Arbor, MI (1988), p. 214 In 1028, Baldwin married Adèle of France,David Nicholas, Medieval Flanders ( New York: Longman, 1992), p. 48 the daughter of King Robert II of France. At her instigation, he rebelled against his father, Baldwin IV, but in 1030, they were reconciled. When his father died in 1035 Baldwin succeeded him. == Count of Flanders == While Eustace I, Count of Boulogne, had usually been at odds with Baldwin IV, he and Baldwin V had friendly relations.Heather J. Tanner, Families, Friends, and Allies: Boulogne and Politics in Northern France and England, c. 879-1160 (Leiden; Boston : Brill, 2004), p. 83 They signed each other's charters and worked together several times. Eustace I signed three of Baldwin's charters, which limited the power of advocates. Flanders under Baldwin V did not have very good relations with England. Eljas Oksanen, Flanders and the Anglo-Norman World, 1066-1216 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 11 Baldwin gave refuge to England's exiles and even gave them ships and men at times. He protected Queen Emma from 1036 to 1040 as well as her two sons: Alfred and Harthacnut. When Earl Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family were exiled by Edward the Confessor in 1051 to 1052, Baldwin welcomed them and helped them to prepare their return to England. In turn. Edward the Confessor positioned his fleet off the coast of Flanders while Baldwin warred with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor in 1049. The threat caused Baldwin to sue for peace with Henry. Baldwin V had a great deal of influence, partly because of several marriages between Flanders and England and France and Germany.Renée Nip, 'The Political Relations Between England and Flanders (1066-1128), Anglo-Norman Studies XXI: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998, ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999), pp. 146-47 Baldwin was close to his brother-in-law, Henry I, King of France. From 1060 to 1067. Baldwin was the regent for his nephew Philip I of France. In 1051. Baldwin had coerced Richildis, the widow of Count Herman of Hainault, to marry his son Baldwin VI.Renée Nip, 'The Political Relations Between England and Flanders (1066-1128), Anglo-Norman Studies XXI: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998, ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999), p. 147 That gave him control of Hainault through his son and also led to a series of conflicts between Baldwin V and Emperor Henry III, as Hainault was part of the Holy Roman Empire. After a series of defeats, Henry III returned to Germany and died a short time later. In 1056. Baldwin received the whole of the Mmarch as a fief from Agnes of Poitou, the regent for her son Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Jean Dunbabin, France in the Making 843-1180, Second Edition (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 209 Baldwin's daughter Matilda married William I of England, later King of England. At first, the marriage was banned by Pope Leo IX. He did not give a reason, but it was probably the fact that the two were cousins.David C. Douglas, William The Conqueror (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964), p. 76 Som time between 1050 and 1052, the two married despite the papal ban. Although Baldwin allowed some Flemish support for his Norman conquest of England. relations between Baldwin and his son-in-law William I were not that friendly.Renée Nip, 'The Political Relations Between England and Flanders (1066-1128), Anglo-Norman Studies XXI: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 1998, ed. Christopher Harper-Bill (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1999), p. 145 William feared Baldwin's growing power. However, by then, Baldwin was growing old.
