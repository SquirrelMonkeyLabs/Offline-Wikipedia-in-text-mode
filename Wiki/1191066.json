BFAS has regional offices in cities like Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, and Salt Lake City, and partners with shelters and rescue groups across all 50 states. It holds a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator. == History == BFAS traces its origins to the Process Church of the Final Judgment, founded in England in 1966. The group relocated to Kanab, Utah, in 1984, began operating as Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in 1991, and became Best Friends Animal Society in 2003. In 2019, it partnered with Southern Utah University to offer a course in no-kill shelter management. == Animal Sanctuary == The sanctuary, located on 3,700 acres in Angel Canyon, Utah, with 33,000 acres leased nearby, houses about 1,500 animals. It includes specialized areas like Dogtown and Cat World. Some animals live there permanently due to medical or behavioral issues. == Los Angeles Center == In 2011, BFAS took over a city shelter in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, under a contract to care for animals from city shelters. The contract drew criticism for its lack of competitive bidding. BFAS stopped operating the shelter by 2021. == References == Category:1984 establishments",
