 "text": "The Igbo calendar is the traditional calendar system of the Igbo people from Nigeria. It consists of 13 months in a year, each month has 7 weeks, and there are 4 Igbo market days in a week. Also, there is an extra day at the end of the year. The Igbo calendar was influenced by both worship and commerce. In Igbo mythology, markets played a important role, with each community having particular market days. These market days are still followed today, keeping the Igbo calendar related and in use. Some Igbo communities have tried to change their thirteen-month calendar to match the twelve-month Gregorian calendar. The Igbo calendar is not the same everywhere, leading to different weeks or even years across differeny groups. Still, a four to eight day cycle helps coordinate market days between villages. Some areas, like the Kingdom of Nri, do start the year together. == References == Category:Calendars Category:Nigerian culture",
