 "text": "The Ommaya reservoir is an invention by Dr Ayub K. Ommaya, a famous neurosurgeon. During surgery a catheter - a thin tube - is placed into one of the ventricles of the brain. The catheter is attached to a reservoir right under the scalp. The Ommaya reservoir can be used for a few different things:Leonidas C. Goudas et al.: Acute Decreases in Cerebrospinal Fluid Glutathione Levels after Intracerebroventricular Morphine for Cancer Pain, International Anesthesia Research Society 1999 * To deliver chemotherapy directly to where a brain tumor is * To take samples of cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord. This can cut down on the number of painful spinal taps (lumbar punctures) the patient needs to have. * To give morphine directly into the brains of patients who are dying of cancer and are in terrible pain ==References== Category:Surgery",
