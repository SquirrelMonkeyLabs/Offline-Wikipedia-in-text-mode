Kraemer (1992), Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam, p. 1 & 148, Brill Publishers, . is traditionally said to have lasted from the 8th century to the 13th century.Matthew E. Falagas, Effie A. Zarkadoulia, George Samonis (2006). \"Arab science in the golden age (750â€“1258 C.E.) and today\", The FASEB Journal 20, p. 1581-1586. However, some place its start as early as the Umayyad Caliphate (founded in 661 by Caliph Mu'awiya I) and its end as late as the late 15th and the 16th centuries, including the rise of the Islamic gunpowder empires: the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid Empire, and the Mughal Empire. The Islamic Golden Age is traditionally understood to have begun during the reign of Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786 to 809) who started in the 8th century the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, the world's largest city. The library saw scholars from all over the Muslim world flock to translate the known world's classical knowledge into Arabic and Persian. Under the Umayyads, Al-Andalus also became a centre of science, medicine, philosophy, and inventions during the Islamic Golden Age. The period got its name because engineers, scholars, and traders in the Islamic world did much for the arts, agriculture, economics, industry, law, literature, navigation, philosophy, sciences, and technology. They built upon earlier traditions and added inventions and innovations of their own.Howard R. Turner, Science in Medieval Islam, University of Texas Press, November 1, 1997, , pg. 270 (book cover, last page) Howard R. Turner wrote, \"Muslim artists and scientists, princes and laborers together created a unique culture that has directly and indirectly influenced societies on every continent.\" == Other websites == * Golden age of Arab and Islamic Culture * The Influence of Islamic Philosophy and Ethics on The Development of Medicine During the Islamic Renaissance - By Dr. Sharif Kaf Al- Ghazal == Notes == Category:History of Islam Category:Periods and ages in history",
