 "text": "\"La Congolaise\" (; \"The Congolese\") is the national anthem of the Republic of the Congo. == Lyrics == French official Kikongo translation English translation I On this day the sun rises And our Congo stands resplendent. A long night is ended, A great happiness has come. Let us all, with wild joyfulness, sing The song of freedom. Arise, Congolese, proud every man, Proclaim the unity of our nation. Let us forget what divides us And become more united than ever. ùÑÜ Let us live our motto: Unity, work, progress. ùÑá II From the forest to the bush, From the bush to the ocean, One people, one soul, One heart, ardent and proud. Let us all fight, every one of us, For our black country. III And if we have to die, What does it really matter? Our children Everywhere will be able to say how Triumph comes through battle, And in the smallest village Sing beneath our three colours. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Republic of the Congo culture",
