 "text": "The Pontifical Commission for Latin America is a department of the Roman Curia that has been charged with giving help to the Catholic Church in Latin America since 1958. The Commission works under the leadership of the Dicastery for Bishops. Robert Francis Prevost was president of the Commission from April 12, 2023 until his election as Pope Leo XIV on May 8, 2025. There are two secretaries, both laypersons: Rodrigo Guerra LÃ³pez and Emilce Cuda, appointed in July 2021 and February 2022, respectively. When appointed, Guerra was the only layperson with the rank of secretary in the Curia; the only layman with a higher rank was Paolo Ruffini, prefect of the Dicastery for Communications. Cuda became one of the few women in senior positions in the Curia. Pope Pius XII created the Commission as an independent body in the Roman Curia on 19 April 1958. ==References== Category:Catholicism",
