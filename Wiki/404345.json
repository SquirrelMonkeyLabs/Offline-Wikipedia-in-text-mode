 "text": "The Boston Post was a newspaper published in Boston, Massachusetts between 1831 and 1956. It was one of the most popular daily newspaper in New England for over a hundred years. The Post was founded in November 1831 by two businessmen: Charles G. Greene and William Beals. By the 1930s, The Boston Post had grown to be one of the largest newspapers in the country, with well over a million readers. During the 1940s, the newspaper faced more and more competition from papers published by William Hearst. More people began listening to the news on radio and television, and the paper's business began to suffer. It stopped being published in October 1956. At the time, it was printing about 255,000 copies of its daily issue, and about 260,000 of its Sunday edition.(4 October 1956).

The Boston Post was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for its investigation into and its exposure of fraud by Charles Ponzi. It was the last Pulitzer won for public service awarded to a Boston newspaper until the Globe won it in 2003. ==Boston Post Cane== The Boston Post Cane was an award given by many New England towns to their oldest citizen. It was originally done in 1909, when the newspaper was owned by Edwin A. Grozier. The newspaper had several hundred ornate, gold-tipped canes made, and then given presented in a ceremony to each town's oldest living man. The custom was expanded to include a community's oldest women in 1930. Many towns in New England still carry on the Boston Post cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909. When a recipient dies (or leaves the community), the cane passes to a successor who is the town's next oldest living resident. ==Image gallery== File:The Boston Post Building Milk Street.png|The Boston Post Building 15–17 Milk Street, Boston, Massachusetts File:Sunday Boston Post Magazine July 1914.jpg|The Boston Sunday Post Sunday Magazine July 5, 1914. ==References== Category:1831 establishments in the United States Category:1956 disestablishments Category:Pulitzer Prize winners Category:Newspapers in Massachusetts Category:Boston Category:19th-century establishments in Massachusetts Category:1950s disestablishments in the United States Category:20th-century disestablishments in Massachusetts",
