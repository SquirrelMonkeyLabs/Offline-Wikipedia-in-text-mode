 "text": "The Lapland War, was a conflict fought by Finland against Germany from September 1944 - April 1945 during the European theatre of World War II. Before this, Finland had been fighting with Germany against the Soviet Union in the Continuation War to regain land it lost after the Winter War. In June 1944, the Soviets started an offensive against the Finnish and German forces near the Finnish-Soviet border. In September, signed peace with the Soviets and declared war on Germany. The German forces in northern finland (Lapland) refused to leave and so the Finns were forced to expel the Germans out with deadly force. The Soviets also helped in north-eastern finland and the Finnish-Norwegian border. On 27 April 1945, the last German forces left finland and the war in Finland ended.
