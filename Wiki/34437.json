 "text": "The twin prime conjecture is a mathematical theory. It asks if there are infinitely many twin primes. Twin primes are prime numbers that differ by two. For example, 3 and 5 are both prime and differ by two. They are twin primes. 23 is prime, but it is not a twin prime. The primes nearest to 23 are 19 and 29. Twin primes were discovered by Euclid in 300 B.C. Since Euclid's time mathematicians have wondered whether there are an infinite number of twin primes. Many mathematicians are still trying to find the answer. ==References== Category:Prime numbers Category:Conjectures",
