Haworth emigrated to the Netherlands and worked together with among others Ina Santhagens-Waller, and . ==Biography== Haworth was born in 1890 in Accrington as the daughter of John Haworth and Alice Jenkinson. She had two brothers: Thomas Reginald and John. Haworth was educated by famous violinist Adolph Brodsky at the conservatorium in Manchester, where she graduated in 1910. Described as a \"young talented violinist\" she gave her first concert in the Netherlands on 6 April 1910 with singer R. van Zijp at the concerthall of hotel “du Soleil” in Nijmegen. A few years later, on 8 November 1913 she gave a concert together with singers Ina Santhagens-Waller and led by in Hilversum. She continued playing in the Netherlands, with her next concert in February 1914 with Santhagens-Waller and Cornelis at 'De Kroon' in Haarlem. From September 1913 until January 1914 she was a member of the famous Concertgebouworkest in Amsterdam as a second violinist. Next to being a violinist, Haworth was also a fencer at Salle Giandominici of Giovanni Giandomenici in Amsterdam. Singer Ina Santhagens- Waller, with whom she gave concerts at the time, was also a fencer at Salle Giandominici. Haworth entered for 1914 Salle Giandomenici international women's fencing competition, but withdrawn. In the next years she continued performing together with Cornelis. In 1916 Haworth was described as a \"known violinist\". In late 1918 she also gave concerts with Dina Italie. She worked together with Cornelis until 1919. Later in 1919 she went by boat to the Dutch East Indies, together with Louis Davids, his partner Margie Morris and dancer Lini Bergsma. She went on tour with Eugénie Gallois starting in Surabaya in July 1919. They went to Surabaya in August. They gave their last concerts in September in Sukabumi and Cianjur, Cianjur Regency. A concert in Batavia was cancelled due to \"lack of interest\". At the Dutch East Indies Haworth married Eduard Loman from Amsterdam (born 1886) on 1 June 1920 on Surabaya, East Java. After moving back to The Netherlands they had a daughter, Laura Dorothea (born 1927), and a son, Eduard (born 1931). It seems she stopped her active violin career after her tour and marriage. However, she played again in 1948 in the play 'Vorstin des Volks'. Living in Amsterdam, she divorced Loman in October 1950. Haworth died on 26 August 1968 in Amsterdam at the age of 78. ==Ex- libris== Haworth was friends with the Selleger family. This family owned the paper factory Gelderland in Nijmegen. While being in their summer residence in Bergen, North Holland, she came in contact with many artists, including Richard Roland Holst. Holst made two circular ex-libris for Haworth. Her motto \"Art is a battle\", is on the ex-libris. The first ex-libris is from 1915. The second one was a adjusted one after her marriage in 1920. A third ex-libris for their children Eduard and Joyce was made by a mistress of Holst: Ina Santhagens-Waller. The design for the 1915 ex-libris is owned by the Rijksmuseum. The three original clichés (mounted on wooden blocks) are owned by Museum Meermanno since 2010. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Musicians from Lancashire Category:Dutch fencers Category:British violinists Category:Sportswomen",
