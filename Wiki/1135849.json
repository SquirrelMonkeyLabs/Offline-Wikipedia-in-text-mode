 "text": "Blogger is a tool that lets people write blogs online. It started in 1999 and was made by Pyra Labs. Google bought it in 2003. Google hosts the blogs. Users can access these blogs through a blogspot.com address or their own custom domain (like www.example.com). Before May 1, 2010, users could publish their blogs to their own web servers using FTP, but now all blogs must use Googleâ€™s servers. == References == Category:Blogs",
