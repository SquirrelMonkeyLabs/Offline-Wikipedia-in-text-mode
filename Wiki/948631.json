 "text": "Suzie Zuzek (1920â€“2011) was an American artist and textile designer. Her work was mainly seen in Lilly Pulitzer dresses from the 1960s to the 1980s. While Zuzek used a naturalistic color scheme, both bright flowers and soft-toned animals in true hues, Pulitzer printed them in strong, vivid colors. Zuzek was born Agnes Helen Zuzek in 1920 to Yugoslav immigrants. She grew up outside of Buffalo, New York, and served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps during World War II. == References == Category:1920 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American designers",
