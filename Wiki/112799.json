 "text": "Eumuroida are a group of all muroid rodents, or the true muroids. It was made in 2004. The group is not in the standard taxonomic classification, but it is between superfamily and family. The Eumuroida is the clade including all organisms which evolved from the most recent ancestor of the Calomyscidae, Nesomyidae, Cricetidae, and Muridae. ==Taxonomy== *Family Calomyscidae **Subfamily Calomyscinae (mouse-like hamsters) *Family Nesomyidae **Subfamily Cricetomyinae (pouched rats and mice) **Subfamily Dendromurinae (African climbing mice, gerbil mice, fat mice and forest mice) **Subfamily Mystromyinae (white-tailed rat) **Subfamily Nesomyinae (Malagasy rats and mice) **Subfamily Petromyscinae (rock mice and the climbing swamp mouse) *Family Cricetidae **Subfamily Arvicolinae (voles, lemmings and muskrat) **Subfamily Cricetinae (true hamsters) **Subfamily Neotominae (North American rats and mice) **Subfamily Sigmodontinae (New World rats and mice) **Subfamily Tylomyinae *Family Muridae **Subfamily Deomyinae (spiny mice, brush furred mice, link rat) **Subfamily Gerbillinae (gerbils, jirds and sand rats) **Subfamily Lophiomyinae (crested rat) **Subfamily Murinae (Old World rats and mice including vlei rats) ==References== *Jansa, S.
