In February 2018 in Delhi, a man living in New Friends Colony was accused of rape by his 11-year-old daughter. Later, in court, the girl admitted she had \"exaggerated\" the complaint after watching Savdhaan India. She said that because she watched the show, she thought her father's innocent kisses were wrong. The court found the father not guilty. == References == == Other websites == * Official website on Hotstar * Savdhaan India at IMDb Category:2010s Indian television series debuts Category:2012 television series debuts",
