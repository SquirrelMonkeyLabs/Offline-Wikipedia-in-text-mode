 "text": "Popeyes Louisiana Chicken, known simply as Popeyes, is a fried chicken fast food franchise. The franchise, which used to be called Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits, consists of over 2,600 restaurants in over 40 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and over 30 other countries worldwide. Popeyes was started in 1972, and in 1992, became owned by AFC Enterprises, which until 2004, also owned Church's Chicken. In 2017, the company was bought out by a Canadian company called Restaurant Brands International (owned by 3G Capital of Brazil), and Popeyes restaurants are now operated as a subsidiary along with Burger King and Tim Hortons. Popeyes' headquarters recently moved from Atlanta to Miami. ==References== Category:1972 establishments Category:American fast food restaurants",
