 "text": "Demolition Man is a 1993 American dystopian science fiction action movie. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Sandra Bullock, Wesley Snipes, Nigel Hawthorne, Benjamin Bratt, Bob Gunton, Denis Leary and Bill Cobbs. The story was inspired by Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World. The movie did very well at the box office. == Plot == The movie begins in 1996 Los Angeles and then jumps ahead to the year 2032 in San Angeles (merged San Diego, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles). San Angeles is now a highly controlled and very wealthy pacifist society, where there is no pollution, unemployment, crime, unhealthy food, physical contact including handshakes or kissing, or even sex and pregnancies (because babies are produced in laboratories), let alone rock music, graffiti or swear words. Stallone acts as John Spartan, a police officer who is intent on bringing down Simon Phoenix (played by Snipes), a psychopathic murderer and criminal strongly intent on causing destruction and serious chaos, like he did back in 1996 and now in 2032. == Other websites == * Category:1993 action movies Category:1993 science fiction movies Category:American action movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:Movies set in the future Category:Movies set in the 1990s Category:Movies set in the 2030s Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Movies set in San Diego Category:English-language movies Category:Warner Bros. movies Category:Dystopian movies",
