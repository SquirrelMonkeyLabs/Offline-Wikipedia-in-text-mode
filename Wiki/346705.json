 "text": "The Olympic rings are the official symbol of the Olympic Games. The design was created by Baron Pierre de Coubertin in 1913. The rings were first used at the Olympic Games Belgium in 1920. The 5 colors of the rings are blue, black, red, yellow and green. It's a common misconception that the colors represent specific continents. In fact, the five colors were chosen so that in combination with the white background, they could produce the colors of all national flags worldwide. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Olympic symbols",
