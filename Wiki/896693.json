Examples of graphic violence include mutilation, bloodshed and removing any animal or human body parts. Others include murder, suicide and assault by weapon. ==Media and television== Graphic (or explicit) violence happens in movies, television, video games and on many news media related broadcasts. Examples of movies or television with graphic violence are Intent to Kill, Man Bites Dog, True Lies, Color of Night, Hideaway, Seven, Crash and Starship Troopers. ===Video games=== Video games that have graphic violence include Mortal Kombat games, Killer Instinct games, Grand Theft Auto games, and The Manhunt games. ==Ratings of the media== There are several cases where movies may have been rated NC-17 and TV-MA for explicit violence. Few, however, have really kept the unrated and TV-MA rating. Those that have include Intent to Kill (1992), Man Bites Dog (1992) and 100 Tears (2007 horror movie). Other similar movies have gone unrated. These include Hatchet (a 2006 horror movie) and The Antichrist (a controversial 2009 movie). Some video games were labeled 'AO' (Adults Only) by the Entertainment Software Rating Board because of graphic violence. Several reverted the rating to 'M' (Mature). AO means that nobody age 17 and under can play, buy or rent the games in question. An M means not suitable for under 17 audiences to buy, play or rent. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Violence Category:Controversies",
