After Geronimo tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a controversy came about the fate and the British government's policy of euthanising any animal that tested positive for bTB. After a number of court battles, Geronimo was euthanised. ==References== Category:2013 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Deaths by euthanasia Category:Individual animals",
