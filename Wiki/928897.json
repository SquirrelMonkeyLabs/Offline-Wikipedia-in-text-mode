 "text": "The military of Afghanistan has taken on many forms during a series of near- constant wars. == From 2002 to 2021 == During their 20-year war against Taliban, the USA attempted to build a rival national military by recruiting locals who liked the USA. When foreign air forces and other support left Afghanistan, the remaining local ground fibres lost control of almost the entire country in one week. == New Taliban == The resurrected Taliban did take on some of the values brought by the USA, such as a strong sense of united national pride. In contrast to their previous prioritisation of Pashtun ethnic identity and international Islamist solidarity. Their new arch rivals, Islamic State Khorisan criticise the Taliban harshly for this nationalism. The (so called) Islamic State are a multi-ethnic anti-Nationalist Caliphate cult, who are determined to eliminate all art and cultures that are incompatible with their extremist distortortion of Islam. == Other websites == * https://mod.gov.af/en * https://twitter.com/modafghanistan2 Category:Afghanistan Category:Military by country",
