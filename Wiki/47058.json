 "text": "Anti-globalization is used for people and groups who oppose certain aspects of globalization in its present form. “Anti-globalization” is considered by many to be a social movement, while others consider it to be several separate social movements. In either case, participants are united in opposition to the political power of large corporations, as exercised in trade agreements and elsewhere, which they say destroys the environment, human rights, labor rights for worker, national sovereignty, the third world, and more. Most people who are called \"anti-globalization\" prefer instead to describe themselves as the Global Justice Movement, the Movement of Movements (a popular term in Italy), the \"alter-globalization\" movement (popular in France), and a number of other terms. The groups and individuals that would come to be known as the \"anti- globalization movement\" developed in the late twentieth century to combat the globalization of corporate economic activity and the free trade with developing nations that might result from such activity. == Other page == *Anti-capitalism == Other websites == *The Scorecard on Development: 25 Years of Diminished Progress (CEPR) *About Globalization *Center for Economic and Policy Research *International Monetary Fund *World Bank Group *World Economic Forum *World Trade Organization *Wobblies *Economic Globalization and the Environment *Smygo News & views for anarchists & activists *Corporatewatch *History of the G8 - UK government site *YaleGlobal Online - An online publication of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization *New World Disorder - Feature website on the movement from RTÉ, the Irish national broadcaster. *\"The ABCs of the Global Economy\" from Dollars & Sense Magazine Category:Economics Category:Social movements",
