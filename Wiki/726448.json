 "text": "An icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes. Icicles are formed on days when the outdoor air temperature is below freezing (less than 0 degrees Celcius) and heat from sunlight melts snow or ice on anything sloped. The droplets of water freeze as they loses their heat to the cold air, forming a cone-like shape of ice. == Shape == Once water starts dripping, it begins to freeze into a certain side. It will melt and freeze over and begin to create icicles. As winter gets longer and temperatures stay in the freezing and sunlight is present, water will just melt and drip alongside the icicle causing them to get longer and sharper. The reason why icicles are pointy is because the water drips in a downward motion. Icicles can range from millimeters to feet in length. == Accidents == Icicles are beautiful, but they can sometimes be dangerous. Icicles have been reported fatal since the 1700s, from falling on people and causing accidents to property being damaged. Icicles can cause damage on many structures such as buildings and homes, once ice forms layers the weight of it can cause the structure to fall or break off. Icicles can also be formed on bridges over streets and highways creating a potential danger for nearby motor vehicles passing by. == References == Category:Meteorology Category:Snow Category:Ice",
