 "text": "In mathematics, specifically group theory, the sporadic groups are a type of group which cannot be classified into any of the infinite families of simple groups. There are 26 sporadic groups, the biggest being the Monster group (or Fischer-Griess monster), with a cardinality of approx. 8.1\\times 10^{53}. The sporadic groups go as follows: * 1. Mathieu groups M11, M12, M22, M23, M24 * 2. Janko groups J1, J2 or HJ, J3 or HJM, J4 * 3. Conway groups Co1, Co2, Co3 * 4. Fischer groups Fi22, Fi23, Fi24′ or F3+ * 5. Higman-Sims group HS * 6. McLaughlin group McL * 7. Held group He or F7+ or F7 * 8. Rudvalis group Ru * 9. Suzuki group Suz or F3− * 10. O'Nan group O'N (ON) * 11. Harada-Norton group HN or F5+ or F5 * 12. Lyons group Ly * 13. Thompson group Th or F3|3 or F3 * 14. Baby Monster group B or F2+ or F2 * 15. Fischer-Griess Monster group M or F1 * (Undecidedly) the Tits group, 2F4(2)′. These are often called the \"happy family\", a name affectionately coined by Robert Griess, who was one of the leading mathematicians on the ongoing research project about sporadic groups at the time. There are 6 exceptions to the happy family, the \"pariahs\", namely being J1, J3, J4, O'N, Ru, and Ly. Category:Group theory",
