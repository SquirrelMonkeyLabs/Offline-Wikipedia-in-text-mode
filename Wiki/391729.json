In simple terms: Democratic: The government is chosen by the people through elections, ensuring that citizens have a say in decision-making. Republic: The country is governed by elected representatives and a constitution, rather than a monarch or dictator. Example: INDIA 1\\. Democratic – Citizens elect their leaders through free and fair elections. 2\\. Republic – The head of state (President) is elected, and the country follows a constitution. In short, a democratic republic means a country where the people have the power to elect their leaders, and those leaders govern according to a set of laws (constitution) rather than hereditary rule. == Various countries == *Democratic Republic of the Congo *People's Democratic Republic of Algeria *Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal *Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka *Somali Democratic Republic *Democratic Republic of Vietnam *People's Democratic Republic of Yemen *Democratic Republic of Georgia *Azerbaijan Democratic Republic *Lao People's Democratic Republic *Democratic Republic of Afghanistan *German Democratic Republic (not a country anymore) *Democratic Kampuchea *Democratic People's Republic of Korea *People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia *Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia *Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste *Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe Category:Forms of government Category:Democracy",
