He was the second most powerful person in the Khmer Rouge, which committed the Cambodian genocide. Nuon Chea was the chief ideologist of the Khmer Rouge regime. When he died in 2019, he was the highest-ranking member of the Khmer Rouge who was still alive. ==Life== He was born in 1926 and was given the name Lao Kim Lorn. He studied law at Thammasat University in Bangkok, Thailand. There, he became a member of the Thai Communist Party. Nuon Chea was the second most powerful person in the Khmer Rouge, after Pol Pot. For this reason, he was called Brother Number Two. ==Conviction== Nuon Chea was arrested in 2007, along with other Khmer Rouge leaders. He was put on trial for crimes against humanity and genocide. He was tried with another important Khmer Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan. In 2014, Nuon Chea was sentenced to life in prison for his crimes against humanity. Later, in November 2018, he was convicted of the crime of genocide. He appealed his prison sentences, but died before the appeals were completed. After he died, his lawyers tried to get his guilty convictions removed, but they did not succeed. ==Death== Nuon Chea died on August 4, 2019 at the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in Phnom Penh, aged 93. Though he was still in prison, he had been hospitalized since July 2 because his body was not delivering blood properly to his toe. As a result, his toe got infected. The infection spread to his bloodstream, and he developed a septic shock. This killed him, probably by causing several of his organs to fail. ===Cremation=== His body was later brought to Sala Krau, Pailin, before cremation according to Buddhist tradition, a religion he persecuted.Top Khmer leader Nuon Chea dies Manila Times ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from sepsis Category:Cambodian genocide Category:Deaths from multiple organ failure",
