 "text": "Thru the Mirror is a Mickey Mouse cartoon short movie produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was released by United Artists in 1936. In this cartoon short, Mickey has a Through the Looking-Glass-type dream that he travels through his mirror and enters a topsy-turvy world where everything is alive. While there, he engages in a Fred Astaire dance number with a pair of gloves and a pack of cards, until the cards chase him out of the bizarre world. It was the 83rd Mickey Mouse short film to be released, the fourth of that year. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Disney animated movies Category:Movies composed by Leigh Harline",
