 "text": "Christine Margaret Keeler (22 February 1942 – 4 December 2017) was an English model and showgirl. ==Profumo affair== At the height of the Cold War, she became sexually involved with a married government minister, John Profumo, as well as a Soviet diplomat. A shooting incident between two of her other lovers caused the press to investigate her, revealing that her affairs could be threatening national security. In the House of Commons, Profumo denied any improper conduct but later admitted that he had lied. This incident discredited the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan in 1963 in what became known as the Profumo affair. ==Death== On 5 December 2017, Keeler died at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough, London from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She was 75. ==References== ==Other websites== * Christine Keeler (1942–), model: Sitter in 10 portraits * Christine Keeler's private photo album * Category:1942 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from COPD Category:English models Category:English entertainers Category:People from Middlesex",
