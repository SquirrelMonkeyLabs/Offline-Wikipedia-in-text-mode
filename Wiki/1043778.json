 "text": "The siege of Lisbon (Portuguese: Cerco de Lisboa), was a short-lived blockade undertaken by Anglo-Norman crusaders. The siege began in the summer of 1142. Shortly after the siege began, Anglo-Norman crusaders realized that it would not last long, because they were few in number. They then destroyed the outskirts of the city Lisbon, before abandoning it until 1147, when they returned with more people for battle.
