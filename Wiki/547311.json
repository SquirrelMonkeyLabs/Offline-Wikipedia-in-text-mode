 "text": "Kek (also spelled as Kuk or Keku) is the ancient Egyptian deity of night and darkness. As a concept, Kek was viewed as having male and female qualities. His female form was known as Kauket (also spelled as Keket), which is simply the female form of the word Kek. Kek's male form was seen as a frog, or as a frog-headed man. The female form was seen as a snake, or a snake-headed woman. He also symbolized the unknown and chaos. Kuk was the god of the hours before dawn and was known as \"Bringer-in-of-the-Light\" as he guided the sun barge of the god Ra toward the sky from the underworld. Kauket, his feminine balance, was depicted as a woman with the head of a serpent also called \"Bringer-in-of- the-Darkness\" who presided over the hours of twilight when the sun was setting and guided the sun barge into the underworld. == References == Category:Egyptian gods and goddesses",
