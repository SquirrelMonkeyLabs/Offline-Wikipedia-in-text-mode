He has two elder sisters, Marian and Margaret. He and his family moved to Canada when he was three years old. When asked why his family left Egypt, Massoud stated, \"I was born there. We immigrated when I was 3 1/2 years old, to Toronto. But I'm still very, very close to my culture and – back home in Egypt. We're Coptic Christian and my parents just felt like things were getting a little too dangerous when I was growing up in Egypt. They wanted to create a better life for their family so they decided to emigrate to Canada.\" Massoud grew up in Markham, Ontario, where he attended St. Brother André Catholic High School. He later attended the University of Toronto with a major in neuroscience, wanting to become a doctor or psychologist. He did not finish this degree, and instead auditioned for theatre schools. Massoud eventually transferred to Ryerson University for their theatre performance program, which he graduated from in 2014. ==References== == Other websites == * * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada Category:Canadian movie actors Category:Canadian television actors Category:Canadian voice actors Category:Egyptian people Category:People from Markham, Ontario Category:People from Cairo Category:Actors from Toronto",
