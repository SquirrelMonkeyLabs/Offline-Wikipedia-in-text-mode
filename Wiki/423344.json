 "text": "Automatic behaviour is the name for a set of actions that occur (or that continue to occur), without conscious thought. Usually, they are guided by a part of the nervous system that is called autonomic nervous system, or visceral nervous system. Automatic behaviour is like a reflex. *Inherited normal behaviours: for example blinking and leaning back when something is waved in front of face. *Learned normal behaviours: cycling is a good example. Also any sport or dance training aims to make proper behaviours automatic. Another example is simply walking without bumping into other people. Many mental illnesses have certain forms of unwanted automatic behaviour. == Related pages == *Unconscious mind *Instinct *Autonomic nervous system Category:Symptoms Category:Reflexes Category:Psychology",
