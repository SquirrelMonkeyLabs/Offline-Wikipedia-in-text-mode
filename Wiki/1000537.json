 "text": "The economy-of-effort theory is an idea in the study of humans and the study of men, women, and sometimes a third or fourth type of person. Scholars use it to say why some groups of people give some work to women and other work to men. In an economy-of-effort scenario, work goes to men or women (or some other type of person) not because of differences in men's and women's bodies but because other things about that culture make it easier. Ember et al. say that if one group has men cut down trees and use wood, they will learn about wood and what it can do. That group might also have men make wooden musical instruments because their other work makes it easier for them to do that. Anthropologists use this idea to explain why some work goes to men or women when other theories, for example male expendability, strength, or compatibility with childcare, cannot. ==Related pages== *Division of labor *Male expendability *Strength theory *Compatibility-with-childcare theory ==References== Category:Anthropology Category:Gender",
