 "text": "Abu al-Hasan al-Hashimi al-Qurashi (), born Nour Karim al-Mutni (; died 15 October 2022), was an Iraqi terrorist and the third leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. He was named as leader on 10 March 2022, in an audio message by the new spokesperson of ISIL, Abu Omar al-Muhajir, whose announcement came more than a month after the death of the previous leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi. The message said that Abu al-Hasan was given a pledge of allegiance in response to the will of the former leader. On 26 May 2022, the Turkish government claimed that he was arrested in Istanbul. Later, ISIL sources denied news reports of his arrest in the 347th issue of their weekly newsletter Al-Naba. On 30 November 2022, ISIL announced that Abu al- Hasan had been killed while fighting. The spokesman of ISIL, Abu Omar, confirmed the news that same day. The United States Central Command confirmed that Abu al-Hasan killed himself by triggering a bomb during an operation carried out by former Free Syrian Army rebels which had aligned with government forces in Daraa Governorate in mid-October. Abu al-Hussein al- Husseini al-Qurashi replaced him as the leader of ISIS. ==Notes== ==References== Category:20th-century births Category:2022 deaths Category:Caliphs Category:Iraqi politicians Category:Islamic State people Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Suicide bombings in the 2020s Category:Suicide in 2022 Category:Iraqi military people Category:Deaths by suicide bomber Category:War criminals Category:Suicide bombers Category:Iraqi murderers",
