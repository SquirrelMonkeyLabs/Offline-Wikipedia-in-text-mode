 "text": "The Polish State Railways (Polish: Polskie Koleje Państwowe, abbr.: PKP S.A.) is the main railway operator in Poland. The company was founded when the former Polish State Railways state-owned enterprise was divided into several units based on the need for separation between infrastructure management and transport operations. Polish State Railways is the main company in PKP Group collective that resulted from the split. It has 100% share control, being fully responsible for the assets of all of the other PKP Group component companies. The group's organisations are dependent upon Polish State Railways, but proposals for privatisation have been made. ==Tourism== The PKP has been a tourist attraction for British trainspotters since the mid-twentieth century. The late withdrawal of steam power on the PKP system meant that Poland was an attractive destination for rail enthusiasts long after steam had ended on Britain’s railways. The last PKP steam shed in Wolsztyn has remained in operation as a result of this tourism and continues to operate regular steam hauled services. ==References== Category:1926 establishments in Europe Category:1920s establishments in Poland Category:Rail transport in Poland Category:State-owned enterprises Category:Railway companies Category:Companies of Poland",
