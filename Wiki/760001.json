 "text": "Louis Réard (1897 – September 16 1984) was a French automobile engineer and clothing designer. He introduced the modern two-piece bikini in July 1946. Son of the owner of \"Folies Bergères\" in Paris, he decided to radically change his sector of activity by inventing a swimsuit allowing girls to sunbathe without having to roll it up. Réard afterwards opened a bikini shop in Paris and sold swimsuits for 40 years. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1984 deaths Category:French mechanical engineers Category:French fashion designers",
