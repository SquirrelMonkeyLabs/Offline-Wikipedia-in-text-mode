 "text": "Windows 7 is a no-longer supported version of Microsoft Windows, an operating system for personal computers. It is the successor to Windows Vista, the sixth major release of the Windows operating system. According to Microsoft, Windows 7 improves the speed, reliability, and compatibility from Windows Vista. Windows 7 was once the most popular Windows version by far, but is by now third most popular with a tiny market share. The beta version of Windows 7 was released on January 9, 2009, and the release candidate was released on May 5. The final version of Windows 7 was sent to PC manufacturers on July 22, 2009, so that they have three months to change it and include it with their computers. Windows 7 was released to the public on October 22, 2009. On January 22, 2020, Microsoft Internet Games Services stopped working on Windows 7. Extended Security Updates (ESU) is a paid computer program which allowed to receive security updates for some Microsoft products for 3 years after the end of extended support date, which is now in the past, excluding for some embedded editions and for Azure customers of the its server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2. == New and changed features == Windows 7 includes many new features, such as touchscreen, supporting virtual hard disks, being faster on multi-core processors, and a redesigned taskbar. The taskbar allows users to pin the most frequently used programs directly to it, instead of on a toolbar. The glass user interface, Aero, has been improved with features such as Aero Shake, Aero Snap, and Aero Peek. Windows 7 has removed some features that were in Windows Vista, including Windows Mail, Windows Movie Maker, Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Calendar, Windows Ultimate Extras, and the InkBall game, as well as many customization options such as the Classic Start Menu. Windows Mail, Windows Movie Maker, and Windows Photo Gallery were replaced by similar set of programs known as Windows Live Essentials. The Windows Live Essentials are not included in Windows 7, and have to be downloaded from Microsoft's website. == Editions == There are six editions of Windows 7, which contain different features that are meant to be suited for the customer: * Starter (for low-cost Personal computers) * Home Basic (released only in developing countries) * Home Premium (for home users) * Professional (for small businesses) * Ultimate (all features) * Enterprise (same as Ultimate, but for businesses) == Development == At first, a major version of Windows code-named Blackcomb was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Features planned for Blackcomb included the Sidebar, an emphasis on looking for data, and an advanced storage system named WinFS. However, a minor release code-named Longhorn was announced for 2003, delaying the making of Blackcomb. By the middle of 2003, Longhorn had gotten some of the features meant for Blackcomb. After three major viruses exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time in 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while they made new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn was reset in September 2004, and it was renamed to Windows Vista. A number of features were cut from Windows Vista as it was being remade. After Windows Vista was released, Microsoft announced a new plan for the next version of Windows, code-named Windows 7, in 2007. In 2008, it was announced that Windows 7 would also be the official name of the operating system. === Support lifecycle === == Early testing versions == === Milestone 1 === The first known build was called Milestone 1.
