 "text": "A car platform (automobile platform) is shared common design and production over different models and types of automobiles. They may be sold under different names or \"marques\". It is done by the automotive industry to save the costs of development by basing the products on a smaller number of platforms. This allows companies to create distinct models from similar underpinnings. It is also done with commercial vehicles like trucks and vans. == References == Category:Automobiles Category:Design",
