 "text": "The yellowbelly voiceless tree frog or yellow-bellied voiceless tree frog (Charadrahyla altipotens) is a frog that lives in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in Mexico. Scientists have seen it between 1100 and 1900 meters above sea level in cloud forests and pine-oak forests. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is about 68.8 to 75.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 69.4 to 75.3 mm long. This frog is light brown, light green, or dark green in color on its back. This frog can change color and look dark brown. This frog can have dark green or brown spots. It can have dark bars across its legs. There is a light brown stripe above its mouth. There are two stripes from its mouth to its eyes over its head. On the sides, this frog is light yellow in color. The webbing between its toes is yellow-tan. The belly and throat are yellow. The iris of the eye is copper in color. Tadpoles are dark brown in color with gold marks on the belly. Young frogs are reddish in color with stripes. This frog does not have vocal sacs or vocal slits, so scientists think it does not sing or croak, not even when the frogs look for mates. ==Reproduction== This frog lays eggs during the time of year when there is less rain. The female frog lays eggs in streams. The tadpoles grow during the rainy season. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out. Both the IUCN Red List and the government of Mexico say this frog is endangered. It is in danger because of sickness and because human beings change the places where it lives. Human beings cut down trees for wood and to build cities. Also, the chemicals that human beings use to kill pests and make crops grow can kill this frog. Pollution can also kill this frog. ==Name== The Latin name of this frog altipotens means \"very powerful.\" Scientists named it this because the male frogs have large sex organs. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
