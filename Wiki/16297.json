He was also a successful lawyer, arguing many cases before the United States Supreme Court. he died of influenza related pneumonia at age 67 in Indianapolis Indiana == Presidency == Benjamin Harrison as president wanted to increase tariffs (a tax on goods that come into the country) for two reasons: * First, it gave more money to the U.S. government, so it could fund important things. * Second, because he believed in protectionism. He thought a high tariff would encourage Americans to make more of their own things instead of buying them from foreign countries. Harrison spent the money received from the tariffs to give money to injured American Civil War veterans. Harrison was the first president to have a billion dollar budget for the government. People criticized him for that. He also signed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act which gave the U.S. government the power to regulate big businesses. == References == == Other websites == * Benjamin Harrison's White House biography Category:1833 births Category:1901 deaths Category:American Civil War generals Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Deaths from influenza Category:Politicians from Ohio Category:United States senators from Indiana Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Military people from Ohio Category:19th-century presidents of the United States",
