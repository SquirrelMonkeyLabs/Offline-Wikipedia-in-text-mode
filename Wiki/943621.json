 "text": "The 80 metres hurdles at the 1934 Women's World Games was held at the White City Stadium in London, from 9 to 11 August 1934. During the heats the starter waited a very long time in before firing the start gun. In heat 4 the Dutch Agaath Doorgeest was disqualified after making two false starts. The British public did not agree. The audience started to whistle and there were chants. The public demanded that she got another chance. When that (of course) didn't happen, the public request the starter who was the starter at the Empire Games a few days earlier. It took so long for the crowd to calm down that some of the athletes didn't want to start anymore. In the final, the German Ruth Engelhard won the event in 11.6 seconds that was a new world record, beating the previous world record 11.7 seconds of the American Babe Didrikson. ==Results== ===Heats=== ====Heat 1==== Rank Name Nationality Time Notes 1 Ondina Valla 12 sec.
