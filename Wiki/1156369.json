 "text": "Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U.S. 578 (2020), is a case whose outcome was chosen by the United States Supreme Court. In Chiafalo v. Washington, the United States Supreme Court said 1 of the most powerful things anybody has ever said about faithless elector laws. Faithless elector laws make it against the law for 2 kinds of electors to vote differently than they said they would. Those 2 kinds of electors are: electors for President of the United States of America; and electors for Vice President of the United States of America. In Chiafalo v. Washington the United States Supreme Court said that faithless elector laws are lawful. Colorado Department of State v. Baca, 591 U.S. ___ (2020) is so much like Chiafalo v. Washington that the United States Supreme Court made its choice in Colorado Department of State v. Baca based on its choice in Chiafalo v. Washington.
