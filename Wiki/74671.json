 "text": "A square yard (sometimes written ydÂ² ) is the United States and British unit of measurement for area. It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to one yard (3 feet or 36 inches). This measurement can be found by squaring the measure of one side of the square. It was formerly used in most of the English-speaking world, but now is generally replaced by the square metre. However, it is still used in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Pakistan and India. Category:Imperial units Category:Units of area",
