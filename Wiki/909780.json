 "text": "The Battle of Chernobyl was a battle between the Russian and Ukrainian armed forces that ocurred within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone on the first day of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian forces had moved in southward from Belarus. At the end of the day, the Russians gained control of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. == Background == In the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, lots of radioactive materials came from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The radioactive materials then went into the environment around it. This area is a radius around the power plant. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it became part of Ukraine and was managed by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. == Battle == On 24 February, 2022, the Ukraine government said that Russian forces were attacking the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. At the end of the day, the Ukraine government said that Russia captured Chernobyl and Pripyat. After this, the American government said \"credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage.\" It was said that artillery shells hit radioactive waste. This caused more radioactivity. The International Atomic Energy Agency, however, said that \"there had been no casualties nor destruction at the industrial site.\" == Reactions == Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the capture of that zone was \"declaration of war against the whole of Europe\". Mykhailo Podoliak, an advisor to the President's Office of Ukraine said that it was a \"totally pointless attack\", and \"the condition of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant, confinement, and nuclear waste storage facilities is unknown\". == Analysis == Ben Hodges, a former general for United States Army Europe, said that the zone was helpful for Russia because it became easier to attack from the North. The former American Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense American Deputy Assistant for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia Evelyn Farkas said that Russia wants to surround Kyiv. According to BBC News, monitoring stations in the area reported a 20-fold increase in radiation levels, up to 65 Î¼Sv/h. == References == Chernobyl Category:Chernobyl Category:February 2022 events",
