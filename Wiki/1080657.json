 "text": "Geoffrey G. Diehl is an American Republican politician from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is best known for his runs in both the 2018 United States Senate election in Massachusetts, and in the 2022 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, both of which were unsuccessful. Hailing from Austin, Texas and graduating at Lehigh College in Pennsylvania, Diehl was a member of the Democratic Party until around 2009, when he switched to the Republican Party. In his first electoral run, he beat then Massachusetts House member Allen McCarthy for the 7th Plymouth seat, before winning reelection two more times. When Thomas Kennedy, a sitting Massachusetts Senate member, died, Diehl ran for his seat in the special election, before falling to Michael Brady. Diehl is a Trump Republican, and ran on a Pro Trump platform in both of his notable electoral runs. Since Massachusetts is one of the most Anti Trump states in the United States, it heavily damaged his campaigns, and led to his defeat twice.
