 "text": "Eliza Gladys \"Millvina\" Dean (2 February 1912 â€“ 31 May 2009) was a British civil servant, cartographer, and the last living survivor of the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912. At two months old, she was also the youngest passenger aboard. She was two months old when she went on the Titanic with her mother, father, and brother. When the Titanic hit an iceberg, her father felt it and told his wife to get her children dressed and go to the deck, or front, of the ship. Dean, her mother, and her brother all got into a lifeboat and got away from the sinking Titanic. Her father did not survive. Dean started to take part in Titanic-related activities when she was in her seventies, and did not like it when forms of entertainment use the Titanic. The only Titanic movie she watched was A Night to Remember, and she hated it as it was too painful for her to watch. She became the last living Titanic survivor when Barbara West died on 16 October 2007. West, unlike Dean, did not want any publicity from the Titanic. ==References== == Other websites == * Millvina Dean Criticizes the BBC * Titanic Survivor gets Mayoral Tribute * Barbara Dainton, 96, Among Last From Titanic, Is Dead Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Infectious disease deaths in England Category:People from Devon Category:RMS Titanic survivors Category:1912 births Category:2009 deaths",
