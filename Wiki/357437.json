 "text": "The stump or tree stump is a small remaining part of the trunk with the roots still in the ground. Stumps may show the ages of a tree through its rings. The study of these rings is known as dendrochronology. Sometimes stumps are able to grow again into new trees. Sometimes a tree is cut to a stump on purpose to grow again. This is known as \"coppicing\".Buckley, G.P.: Ecology and Management of Coppice Woodlands, 336 pages. Springer, 1992. == References == * Buckley, G.P. 1992.
