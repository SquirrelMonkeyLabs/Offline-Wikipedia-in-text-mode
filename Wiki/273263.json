The rights to the brand are held by Keurig Dr Pepper in the United States, and PepsiCo (or its licensees) in the rest of the world, including Puerto Rico. The origin of the name is unclear. It has been reformulated several times since its launch in 1929. 7-Up Soft Drink contains no caffeine and now has no artificial ingredients or preservatives. It is distributed by the 7-Up/Dr. Pepper company. The company promotes the product as having a crisper, more refreshing lemon-lime taste than before. == References == Category:PepsiCo brands Category:Soft drinks",
