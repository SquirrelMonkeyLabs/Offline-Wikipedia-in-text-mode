In 2008, The speedway was sold to Bruton Smith, hoping that the track could hold a race by 2011 and after four years, the former speedway owners abandoned the lawsuit. In August 2010, NASCAR announced that the track could hold a Cup Series event in 2011. Seven months later, Royal Dutch Shell's Quaker State brand was announced to sponsor the 267-lap race held on July 9, 2011, and was won by Kyle Busch. The race was plagued by a massive traffic problem where many of the fans were expected to attend the race were turned away after several hours on Interstate 71. Following the problem, Kentucky Speedway announced that they bought more land for parking and began to work with the state government to improve the track around the speedway in time for the 2012 race. === New aero package for 2015 === On June 16, 2015, NASCAR announced a new aero package would be used for the 2015 race. The changes include a smaller rear spoiler and other adjustments that significantly reduced aerodynamic downforce. The spoiler was decreased to tall, There was also a wide splitter extension. In addition, Tires supplied to Goodyear provided drivers with more grip. \"We want to see more load changes on the racetrack\", NASCAR Executive Vice-President and Chief Racing Development Officer Steve O'Donnell said in a media teleconference, \"We will evaluate and a number of factors coming out of Kentucky, and see what we can learn and implement down the road\". Originally, the package was to be used at last year's All Star Race, but the plan was scrubbed and NASCAR opted to use the package for a points race. \"Let me be clear. This is not a test, this is a race\" O'Donnell said of the rules package will be in effect for the 18th round of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. \"We had an extensive testing plan with this industry over the past 18 months. We couldn't implement this if we didn't feel confident as an industry to implement it at Kentucky. == Trophy == Since 2015, the race trophy has been in the form of a Crosley jukebox. == Past winners == Year Date Winner Start Manufacturer Cautions/Laps Lead changes Number of cars Laps Miles Speed 2011 July 9 Kyle Busch 1st Toyota 6/32 20 43 267 137.314 2012 June 30 Brad Keselowski 8th Dodge 4/24 17 43 267 145.607 2013 June 30* Matt Kenseth 16th Toyota 10/42 11 43 267 131.948 2014 June 28 Brad Keselowski 1st Ford 6/34 12 43 267 139.723 2015 July 11 Kyle Busch 9th Toyota 11/49 13 43 267 129.402 2016 July 9 Brad Keselowski 2nd Ford 11/53 16 40 267 128.580 2017 July 8 Martin Truex Jr. 2nd Toyota 9/39 9 40 274* 138.604 2018 July 14 Martin Truex Jr. 1st Toyota 4/22 14 39 267 150.454 == Notable moments == * 2011: The race was the first Cup Series race at Kentucky Speedway, The race was won by Kyle Busch for the Joe Gibbs Racing team, David Reutimann finished second, and Jimmie Johnson clinched third, The race, 18th of the season, began at 7:30 p.m. EDT and was televised live on TNT.
