 "text": "The classical unities, Aristotelian unities or three unities are rules for drama. They are found in Aristotle's Poetics. These are the three unities: * The unity of action: a play should have one main action that it follows, with no or few subplots. * The unity of place: a play should cover a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place. * The unity of time: the action in a play should take place over no more than 24 hours. == References == Category:Drama Category:Theater",
