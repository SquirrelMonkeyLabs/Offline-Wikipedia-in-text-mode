 "text": "Ebenezer Scrooge () is the main fictional character of Charles Dickens' 1843 novel, A Christmas Carol. At the beginning of the novel, Scrooge is a cold- hearted mean businessman who hates Christmas. He is soon visited by four spirits (Jacob Marleyâ€™s ghost, the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come) who want to save him from going to hell. Scrooge's last name has become byword for selfish or not being generous, while his catchphrase, \"Bah! Humbug!\" is often used to show hatred towards Christmas traditions. The psychological phenomenon of when someone becomes more generous after realizing their mortality or life's purpose is called the Scrooge effect. ==Inspiration== Scrooge was said to have been inspired by a Dutch gravedigger. Ebenezer Lennox was supposedly a merchant from Edinburgh who won a catering contract for King George IV's visit to Scotland. He was buried in Canongate Kirkyard, with a gravestone that is now lost. The theory is that Dickens noticed the gravestone that described Scroggie as being a \"meal man\", but misread it as \"mean man.\" This theory has been described as \"a probable Dickens hoax\". There is no record of anyone named Scroggie in the Edinburgh census returns of the period. Jemmy Wood, owner of the Gloucester Old Bank and possibly Britain's first millionaire, was nationally known for being cheap and may have been another model for Scrooge. ==References== Category:Characters in written fiction Category:Fictional British people",
