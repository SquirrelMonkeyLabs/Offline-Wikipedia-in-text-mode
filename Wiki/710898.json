 "text": "On September 2, 2019, the 75-foot (23 m) diving boat Conception caught fire and sank off the coast of Santa Cruz Island, California. The boat was anchored in Platts Harbor, a small undeveloped bay on the north shore of the island, with over 30 passengers asleep below decks when fire broke out shortly after 3 am. The loss of the ship caused a rescue operation by the United States Coast Guard. Coast Guard divers counted 25 bodies in the sunken hull, while nine other people remain missing. ==References== Category:September 2019 events Category:2010s disasters in the United States Category:Fires in California Category:Shipwrecks Category:2019 in California",
