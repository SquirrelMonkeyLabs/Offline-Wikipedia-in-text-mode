 "text": "In computer science, breadth-first search (BFS) is a method used for traversing a graph. It starts at any item you want to use as a starting position in a graph, and explores all of the neighbor items at the present depth before to moving on to the items at the next depth level. A breadth- first search done on a tree (data structure) is called a level-order traversal. ==Implementation== void breadthFirstSearch(Item root) { Queue q = new Queue(); root.found = true; q.enqueue(item); while (!q.isEmpty()) { Item v = q.dequeue(); for (Item neighbor : v.neighbors()) { if (!neighbor.found) { neighbor.found = true; q.enqueue(neighbor); } } } } ==Usage== Though they have usage in a variety of disciplines, breadth first search algorithms are most often associated with finding the shortest distance between two points, such as on a map. ==Related pages== * Linear search * Binary search * Depth- first search * Bidirectional search Category:Searching and sorting algorithms",
