 "text": "In mathematics, a magma is kind of algebraic structure. It is a set with a binary operation on that set. A binary operation works by taking two elements from a set (that do not have to be different) and returning some other element of that set. If we give the set a label (such as X) and the binary operation a label (such as •). Then we give the magma the label (X, •). ==Examples== The natural numbers with addition form a magma. Because the set of natural numbers is written as \\mathbb{N} and addition is written as + the magma is written as (\\mathbb{N} , +). The name of the magma would be \"The natural numbers under addition\". The integers with multiplication form a magma. Because the set of integers is written as \\mathbb{Z} and multiplication (in abstract mathematics) is written as \\cdot the magma is written as (\\mathbb{Z}, \\cdot). The name of the magma would be \"The integers under multiplication\". The real numbers under division do not form a magma. This is because numbers cannot be divided by 0. A binary operation requires that any two elements can be taken from the set (in this case in order) to produce another element from the set. The real numbers without 0 is written as \\mathbb{R}^*. It can be shown that the (\\mathbb{R}^*, \\div) is a magma. Category:Abstract algebra",
