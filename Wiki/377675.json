The Medal of Honor is bestowed \"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in actual combat against an armed enemy force.\" The medal is awarded by the President of the United States on behalf of the Congress. Of the 3,464 Medals of Honor awarded as of September 17, 2009, an estimated 2,018 have been awarded to Irish-American recipients, more than twice the number awarded any other ethnic group; 257 Irish-born Americans have received the Congressional Medal of Honor which represents more than half of foreign-born MOH recipients. A monument to these Irish-born Medal of Honor winners is located at Valley Forge's Medal of Honor Grove. The first Irish American to receive the Medal was Michael Madden, who received it for his actions in the American Civil War. ==Medal of Honor== The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously. ==Civil War== Image Name Service Rank Unit Place of action Date of action Notes Army Private South Mountain, Maryland September 14, 1862 Single-handed and slightly wounded he accosted a squad of 14 Confederate soldiers bearing the colors of the 16th Georgia Infantry (C.S.A.).
