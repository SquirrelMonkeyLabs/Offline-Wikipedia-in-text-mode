 "text": "Cornu aspersum is the garden snail. They are often called a pest. In English books it was called Helix aspersa for over two centuries, but the current classification now places it in the genus Cornu. They are native to Europe, though have spread elsewhere. It is very similar, but smaller than the Roman snail (Helix pomantia). ==Food== These snails mainly eat plants, since they are herbivores. ==Reproduction== Snails are both male and female. They are able to reproduce by themselves, though normally reproduce sexually. == References == Category:Gastropods",
