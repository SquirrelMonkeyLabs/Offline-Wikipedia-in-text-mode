The members of this group are against euthanasia, abortion and capital punishment. The organization was founded in 1999. Members of the DFLA want to link abortion bans after 20 weeks of pregnancy to the increased support of mothers and pregnant women. They want to stop women from getting or looking for an abortion in most circumstances. They say abortion is a lethal and cruel injustice against unborn children. ==Related pages== *Anti-abortion movement ==References== Category:Controversies in the United States Category:Social movements related to abortion Category:Political organizations based in the United States",
