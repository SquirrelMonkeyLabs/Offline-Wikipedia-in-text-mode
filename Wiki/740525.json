Black and white film was less expensive than color film, and was easier for cinematographers and set designers to work with than the color films of the time. Today, color movies are more popular, but black and white movies are still made occasionally. The earliest still photographs were also in black and white. Black and white still picture film was, and still is, less expensive than color film, and the chemicals to develop it are also cheaper, so it remained popular long after color film was introduced. About 15% of current film sales are black and white film. Major brands of black and white film include Ilford Photo / Kentmere, Kodak Tri-X and TMax, Agfa Photo, Fomapan, Arista, and Rollei. The earliest television broadcasts were transmitted in black and white, and received and displayed by black and white only television sets.For the effect this caused for team uniforms in televised sports, see: Away colours. Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first color television transmission on July 3, 1928. A color television can receive a black and white broadcast, although few (if any) TV stations still broadcast in black and white. ==References== Category:Photography Category:Television technology",
