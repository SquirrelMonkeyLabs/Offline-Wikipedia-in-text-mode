When Akira Takarada appeared in \"Godzilla Final Wars\", released in 2004, he said \"This is still a man who was said to be 100 out of 100 shots in the past. The line is about this work (by director Ryuhei Kitamura's plan). The story is about an ordinary holiday maker who takes up the mission of a dead Interpol agent and finds himself caught between two rival gangs who are fighting over an arms shipment. == Plot == On board the Air France plane ready to leave the Orly Airport there are two passengers. One is a second generation Japanese man born in England who wears dark sunglasses. The other is a man who speaks French and Japanese. They began a conversation. The first began writing a letter to his mother while holding a picture of makuṭa dancers. He told her that he and his friend are going to Bangkok to have a chat over there. The two traveled to Bangkok and Hong Kong without revealing their surnames. Two motorcycle assassins ambushed the two. The sunglasses man get caught with a rope and dragged on the street. The other takes out the first assassin while pulling out his Luger to kill the second. The sunglasses man died in front of him. He is revealed to be an Interpol agent named Andrew Hoshino according to his passport. The other, now named as Andrew Hoshino, arrived at Haneda Airport using his passport and plans to find out who killed the agent. A strange incident happened at the crowded airport. Andrew witnesses a stripper's makeup bag explode at the customs. A Chinese man escaped in the confusion as if he was looking for an opportunity. Andrew chases after him only to lose site of him as he gets in the car and leave. He meets Yumi Sawada, a beautiful woman who offers him a drive. She is a fashionable female bomb expert who sells plastic explosives in Southeast Asia. Guided by Yumi, Andrew arrived at the base of the Akatsuki Gang), a Yakuza crime syndicate led by Jyosuke Akatsuki and was taken prisoner. The Chinese man was actually a weapons dealer named Huang Changkang, who had been smuggling 100 CRS pistols (a re-modeled version of Mauser C96 pistols) from Hong Kong with the stripper in order to get rid of their competitors the Aonuma Gang under the leadership of yakuza boss Takeshi Aonuma. But Yumi has a more powerful weapon that she personally designed on her own, a plastic explosive that can explode anytime, anywhere with an ultrasonic whistle. Eventually, an agent from the International Secret Police was sent from Paris, and Tezuka, a bumbling over confident police detective from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, sneaked into the Akatsuki base to investigate an illegal weapon smuggling. But he ended up getting captured by Akatsuki's henchmen and taken to the basement where Andrew was tied up. The Akatsuki Gang, who was having problem with the two, moved them in a freezing box truck and headed for the Tokai region with Yumi as the lookout. However, Tezuka flirts and teasing with the hot exchange between Hoshino and Yumi as lovers. Huang, who was angry about not getting half of the money from Jyosuke, sold 100 guns to the Akatsuki Gang and went to Takeshi where he sells 200 guns to the Aonuma Gang in exchange for telling about a deal with the Akatsuki's. Huang was told by Aonuma that Hoshino was a hitman dispatched from the Swiss trafficking kingpin de Balmeyer, and came to Japan in aiming for Huang with a French crime boss named Hubert Lebois, who was actually the leader of the weapon smuggling ring. However, Huang was relieved to know that Hoshino was captured by the Akatsuki Gang. Huang then informed of the location where the Akatsuki's would unload 100 guns. Andrew and Tezuka managed to escape while avoid being caught by the two gangs. Yumi, who saw that 100 crates full of CRS pistols were unlikely, started to fall in love with Andrew and saved them by setting up explosives around the beach catching the two gangs by surprise. Hoshino and Tezuka then began to search for Huang and Lubois. The trio began searching for Lebois, who had undergone plastic surgery in Italy. They learned of a stripper left behind by her manager, and Andrew and Tezuka were the same person as Lebois. Tezuka and his colleagues, who migrated to the CRS Special Investigation Headquarters, flew to Manila and started an investigation with the cooperation of the Manila City Police. Andrew was captured by Komori, a hitman for Aonuma, who came from Tokyo. He was placed on a Cessna 172 plane driven by Huang Changkang. Tezuka and Yumi immediately chased after the plane, but Huang Changkang descended with a parachute alone when Hoshino was tied up, unable to grab on to the control stick when Tezuka passed out. Huang was brutally killed when he went in the wrong direction and was cut by a spinning propeller. The two managed to help Andrew escape as the plane crashed into the jungle. Once they have landed in Manila, the three were surrounded by Filipinos and foreign guards led by Lebois. They were taken to his weapons factory. Lebois, who first appeared in front of the three, said that a sunglasses man named Andrew Hoshino should have killed Huang in Hong Kong, and was suspicious of the fake ICPO agent. He was imprisoned in the room by Lebois, who tried to torture Andrew and Tezuka for more information. He was saved by Yumi after she planted the explosives plastic behind the cellar. Hoshino, who carries his pistol against Lebois and his minions, contacted the Manila City Police. Weapon smuggler Lebois was defeated in a final battle with Andrew. He finally avenged his friend's death and completed his mission as an official Interpol agent. The movie ends with Andrew on a speedboat leaving Manila for Tokyo while Tezuka remained with the Manila police. Then out of nowhere, Yumi chased after Andrew and asked for a date. == Staff == * Producers: Tomoyuki Tanaka, Kenichirô Tsunoda * Director: Jun Fukuda * Screenwriters: Michio Tsuzuki (screenplay), Kihachi Okamoto * Composer: Masaru Sato * Cinematographers: Kazuo Yamada (uncredited), Shinsaku Uno * Editors: Ryôhei Fujii, Yoshitami Kuroiwa * Production Designer: Kazuo Ogawa * Assistant Director: Yoshimitsu Banno * Sound Recordist: Fumio Yanoguchi * Synthesis: Izumi Minoru * Stunt Coordinator: Shigeru Nakamura * Photographer: Goichi Araki * Lighting Technician: Hiromitsu Mori == Cast == * Akira Takarada as Andrew Hoshino * Mie Hama as Yumi Sawada * Ichirō Arishima as Detective Tezuka * Jun Tatara as Huang Changkang * Akihiko Hirata as Komori * Sachio Sakai as Jyosuke Akatsuki * Susumu Kurobe as Man of sunglasses * Tôru Ibuki (Matsuki), Chôtarô Tôgin (Ken) as Akatsuki's henchmen * Naoya Kusakawa as Takeshi Aonuma * Koji Iwamoto, Tsune Sunagam, Yukihiko Gondo, Hiroshi Sekita, Yoshio Katsube, Yasuo Araki as Akatsuki's henchmen * Shigeki Ishida as Inspector Tamai * Yasuzo Okawa as Doorman * Hatsue Tonooka as Stripper * Mike Daneen as Hubert Lebois (as Mike Danning) * Haruya Sakamoto as Police detective * Jun Kuroki as Man on the national highway (for Aonuma Gang) * Sachiko Mori as Hostess * Minoru Ito, Hideki Furukawa, Seishirō Kuno as Aonuma's henchmen * Keiichi Morishita as Taxi driver * Hideo Shibuya, Masaki Shinohara, Haruo Suzuki as Lebois's subordinates ※ Uncredit performers * Ryutaro Amami, Masaaki Tachibana, Haruo Nakajima as Detectives * Yasumasa Onishi, Keiichiro Katsumoto, Saburo Kadowaki, Keiji Sakakida, Jiro Mitsuaki as Men at the Haneda Airport * Yoshie Kihira, Fumiko Takano, Takashi Narita as Airline passengers * Midori Uchiyama, Kazuko Tani as Bowling alley guests * Daisuke Inoue as Haneda Airport staff / bowling alley guest (2 roles) * Hiroshi Akitsu as Haneda Airport Man / Blue Swamp Customer (2 roles) * Eisaburo Komatsu as National highway man (for Aonuma Gang) / bowling alley guest (2 roles) * Ryoji Shimizu as Lebois's subordinate / bowling alley guest (2 roles) * Gerd Bisinoski as Lookout Man * Shigeo Suzuki (Otsu), Narunobu Yanagi (Ko) as Motorcycle assassins in Hong Kong * Osman Yusuf, Kuniyoshi Kashima as Lebois's subordinates * Kazuo Imai, Sôji Ubukata as Blue Swamp guests * Wakako Tanabe as Blue Swamp hostess * Ansulmo Garsha as Inspector Morales * Jimmy Scander as Boy == Song == 『100 Shot, 100 Killed』(100発100中, Hyappatsu hyakuchu) *Lyrics: Tokiko Iwatani *Composer: Masaru Sato *Artist: Akira Fuse == Simultaneous screening == 『Baka To Hasami』 (馬鹿と鋏, Stupid Scissors) *Writer: Yasuo Tanami / Director: Senkichi Taniguchi / Starring: Junzaburō Ban",
