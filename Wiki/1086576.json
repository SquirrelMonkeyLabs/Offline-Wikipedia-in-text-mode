 "text": "Font Book is an application software developed by Apple Inc. for managing fonts on macOS devices like iMac and MacBook. It is a proprietary software and registered trademark of the tech company. It was first released with Mac OS X Panther operating system in 2003 and since then comes pre-installed with Apple computers. When a user clicks on a OpenType (.otf) or TrueType (.ttf) font file, Font Book opens, allowing them to preview and install the font. Once installed, the font is copied to a central folder where all other apps can use it. Users can use Font Book to browse all installed fonts. They can see a list of fonts, check out their alphabets, view all the glyphs they have, and even set a sample text of their choice. Font Book allows users to install, manage, preview and organize fonts on their Mac devices. It automatically checks for errors and duplicates when installing fonts to ensure validation and proper functioning. Users can search, filter and sort fonts to find the exact font they want to use. Additionally, Font Book provides options to print and export font lists. Font Book does not include tools for editing fonts. Users cannot rename, merge, or split fonts, nor can they make changes like adjusting spacing or creating new styles. However, Font Book enables users to group fonts into collections, view details about fonts such as the name of the designer and the copyright holder, activate and deactivate individual fonts or collections and check the data integrity of font files. == History == Between 2003 and 2007, Apple's Font Book faced criticism for its inability to validate and automatically activate fonts. These features were added with the release of Mac OS X Leopard on October 26, 2007. == Related pages == * Typography * Typeface *Type Foundry == Other websites == Font Book User Guide == References == Category:Apple software Category:MacOS",
