 "text": "The Langbian bubble-nest frog or Langbian frilled tree frog (Raorchestes gryllus) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and Laos. People have seen it between 880 and 2027 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests on mountains. The frog lays eggs under logs and on tree roots. The frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists think this frog is at some risk of dying out because the places where it lives are changing. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Bidoup-Nui Ba National Park, Phuoc Binh National Park, and Ta Dung Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
