 "text": "Feihyla is a group of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, subfamily Rhacophorinae. They live in southern China and Vietnam. Scientists think they might also live in Laos. Scientists are not sure exactly how these frogs are related to other groups of frogs, but they thing Feihyla is probably a sister taxon to Taruga, Polypedates, and Rhacophorus. That means they think these four groups of frogs are closely related and had the same ancestor frog not too long ago. Scientists first made Feihyla because they could not figure out what to do with frogs in Chirixalus, specifically \"Chirixalus palpebralis.\" ==Description== Scientists decide whether a frog is in Feihyla by looking how it lays its eggs. Feihyla frogs lay eggs in a pile of jelly that has bubbles in it. ==Species== These species are in Feihyla: * Feihyla fuhua Fei, Ye, and Jiang, 2010 * Feihyla inexpectata (Matsui, Shimada, and Sudin, 2014) * Feihyla kajau (Dring, 1983) * Feihyla palpebralis (Smith, 1924) * Feihyla samkosensis (Grismer, Neang, Chav, and Holden, 2007) * Feihyla vittiger (Boulenger, 1897) ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
