Our boys who play this grand old game, Are always striving for glory and fame! See the bombers fly up, up, The other teams they don't fear; They all try their best, But they can't get near, As the bombers fly up! ==References== ==Other websites== * Essendon Football Club website Category:Australian rules football clubs in Victoria",
