 "text": "Comet 81P/Wild, also known as Wild 2, is a comet named after Swiss astronomer Paul Wild (pronounced Vilt), who discovered it in 1978. It is believed that for most of its 4.5 billion-year lifetime, Wild 2 had a more distant and circular orbit. In 1974, it passed within only about one million kilometers of the planet Jupiter, whose strong gravitational pull altered the comet's orbit and brought it into the inner solar system. Its orbital period changed from 40 years to about 6 years, and its perihelion is now about 1.59 AU (astronomical unit). == Gallery == File:Comet wild 2 craters.jpg|Photograph taken by Stardust spacecraft File:Comet wild 2 jet plumes.jpg|Details of the plume jets File:Comet Wild2 Anaglyph.jpg|Red/green stereo anaglyph File:Comet_Wild2.jpg|Stardust Approach Image File:Comet wild 2.jpg| == Other websites == * NASA Team Analyzes Stardust Particle Capture January 18, 2006 * NASA/JPL homepage for Stardust project * Stardust@Home Volunteer Particle Analysis Project * IAU Ephemerides page for 81P * Catalogue of all 72 raw images of Wild 2 Category:Comets",
