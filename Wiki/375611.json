 "text": "is a variety of Japanese citrus. Its name comes from its \"golden\" or bright yellow color. The color is inherited from its mother tree, a variety called ÅŒgonkan or \"Golden Orange,\" which is also bright yellow but smaller. It was hybridized with a variety of Satsuma mandarin orange to obtain an improved variety which was larger (about 77 grams or 2. 7 ounces on average) and easier to peel. The variety was developed at the agricultural experiment station run by Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan.
