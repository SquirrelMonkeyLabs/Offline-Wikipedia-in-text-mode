 "text": "FaceApp is a photo and video editing application for iOS and Android developed by FaceApp Technology Limited. The program is able to realistically change the face in the photo according to the selected parameters: make it older, younger or change gender, hairstyle, add glasses or a smile, using neural networks. The app has been criticized and accused of supporting racism for lightening the skin color of dark-skinned people and for so-called ethnic filters of \"white\", \"black\", \"Asian\", \"Indian\". Company founder Yaroslav Goncharov was forced to delete them with apologies. == References == Category:Graphics software",
