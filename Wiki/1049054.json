It is the administrative capital of Derna District and has a unique location between Jebel Akhdar(also known as Green Mountain), the Mediterranean Sea, and the Libyan desert. The city is diverse with people from different backgrounds. In September 2023, a catastrophic (a sudden great damage or suffering) flood caused by dam collapses during Storm Daniel which resulted in around 30 million cubic metres of water being released in the city, wiped out about a quarter of the city, resulting in at least 11,300 deaths and as per Libyan officials more then 10,000 others are injured, and missing residents while the UN aid agency OCHA said the figure was at least 5,000. ==References== ==Other websites== *Derna from Britannica Category:Cities in Libya",
