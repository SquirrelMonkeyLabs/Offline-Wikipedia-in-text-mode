 "text": "The 1985 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1984â€“85 season, and the culmination of the 1985 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the defending champion Edmonton Oilers (in their third straight Finals appearance) and the Philadelphia Flyers. The Oilers would win the best-of-seven series, four games to one, to win their second Stanley Cup. It was also the sixth straight Finals contested between teams that joined the NHL in 1967 or later. This was the last time, until 2022, that a team would appear in the Finals for three straight season. This would be the third of eight consecutive Finals contested by a team from Alberta (the Oilers appeared in six, the Calgary Flames in and ), and the second of five consecutive Finals to end with the Cup presentation on Alberta ice (the Oilers won four of those times, the Montreal Canadiens once). ==References== * * Podnieks, Andrew; Hockey Hall of Fame (2004).
