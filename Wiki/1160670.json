 "text": "Legoland Holiday Village is a motel and campsite with cabins located 500 metres from Legoland Billund Resort in Billund. The motel was established in 1994 by the Fonden for Billund Hostel under the name Billund FDM Camping and later changed into Legoland Village. It was run in close cooperation with the campsite FDM Camping Billund, which was established in 1992. The operation of the two companies, together with the employees, was taken over by Legoland Billund on 1 January 2014 and has subsequently been run under the joint name Legoland Holiday Village. After the takeover, a renovation was carried out and new cabins were added with Lego and Legoland as the theme. Also many Lego statues were added. The fixed accommodation options have different themes. The motel rooms have a pirate theme. At the campsite you can stay in Lego Ninjago cabins, Lego Wild West cabins, Wilderness barrels (barrel-shaped cabins) or Indian tents. It is also possible to bring your own tent or caravan. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Lego Category:Region of Southern Denmark Category:Buildings and structures in Denmark Category:1994 establishments",
