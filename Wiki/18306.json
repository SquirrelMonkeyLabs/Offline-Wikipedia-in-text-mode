It is Poland's 6th largest city (population of 500 000 people) and the largest and most important sea port. It has existed since the 10th century and many times played a very important role in Poland's history. In the 19th century it was part of Prussia. This is where Solidarity, the movement which helped end Communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, came to life.
