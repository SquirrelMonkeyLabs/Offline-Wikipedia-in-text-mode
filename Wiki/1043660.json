 "text": "\"Nothing Else Matters\" is a power ballad by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released on April 20, 1992 as the third single off their self-titled fifth album. The song was able to make it to #11 on the Mainstream Rock and #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). When he wrote the song, James Hetfield didn't want to show it to the band at first. Hetfield said in an interview with Metal Hammer: \"I thought that Metallica could only be the four of us. These are songs about destroying things, head banging, bleeding for the crowd, whatever it is, as long as it wasn't about chicks and fast cars, even though that's what we liked. The song was about a girlfriend at the time. It turned out to be a pretty big song.\" A music video for the song was released. In the video, the band is recording the song in a studio. Footage of the band doing different things like shooting a basketball, donating money to a disabled veteran and choosing album artwork are shown. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1992 songs Category:1990s ballads Category:Metallica songs Category:Miley Cyrus songs Category:Elton John songs Category:Rock ballads Category:Heavy metal",
