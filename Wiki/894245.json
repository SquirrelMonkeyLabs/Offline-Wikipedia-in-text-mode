 "text": "The Clavinet is a musical instrument. It is an electric clavichord. Ernst Zacharias invented it. The Hohner company of Trossingen, West Germany, built clavinets from 1964 to 1982. The clavinet is like a piano. It makes sounds like an electric guitar. A clavinet has hammers with rubber pads that hits strings to make sounds. Pianos have hammers with felt pads, and they have bigger strings. Stevie Wonder used the instrument for many songs, including his 1972 hit \"Superstition.\" The clavinet is in many songs from rock, funk, and reggae music in the 1960s and 1970s. The clavinet must be plugged into an electric amplifier to make sounds loud enough to enjoy. Most clavinets have 60 keys. ==References== Category:Keyboard instruments",
