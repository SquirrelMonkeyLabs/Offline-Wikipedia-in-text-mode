Founded in 2000 by John Giacobbi, an intellectual property lawyer, the company operates with two offices in the UK. Web Sheriff monitors various websites that host links to unauthorized downloads of music and films. It sends legal take-down notices to BitTorrent and other file-sharing sites in order to combat copyright infringement. The company is known for its “soft sell” approach in the anti-piracy industry, focusing on building relationships and using phone calls to address unauthorized links. Web Sheriff offers a range of copy protection services, including copyright infringement protection, libel prevention, cyber-bullying mitigation, privacy issues related to social media, policing of trading sites, recovery of fraudulently registered domain names, and online security for concert tours. It utilizes proprietary software and web crawler programs to search the internet and employs human auditing to determine the nature of sites hosting copyrighted material. In its history, Web Sheriff has worked with notable clients such as Prince, Bryan Adams, and Axl Rose. The company was hired by Prince to protect his copyrights and remove unauthorized photos, videos, and music from platforms like YouTube, eBay, and The Pirate Bay. It successfully took down infringing content and shut down unauthorized merchandise-selling sites. == References == Category:Technology companies",
