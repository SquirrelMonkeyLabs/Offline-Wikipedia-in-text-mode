 "text": "Adansonia gregorii, commonly known as the boab, is a tree in the family Malvaceae. Its trunk has a swollen base, which makes it easily recognizable. For this reason, it is also called a bottle tree. It is endemic to Australia, where it mostly occurs in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, east into Northern Territory, parts of western Queensland, and New South Wales. There are other species of baobabs, which are native to Madagascar (six species) and mainland Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (one species). Boab ranges from 5 to 15 metres, usually between 9 and 12 metres, with a broad bottle-shaped trunk. Its trunk base may be extremely large; trunks with a diameter of over five metres have been recorded. A. gregorii is deciduous, losing its leaves during the dry winter and producing new leaves and large white flowers between December and May. Category:Malvaceae",
