 "text": "The spot-legged poison frog or spot-legged poison arrow frog (Ameerega picta) is a frog. It lives in Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. Scientists think it could also live in Paraguay. ==Home== People see this frog on dead leaves on the ground and dead branches on the ground. It lives in tropical forests in low places and up into mountains. It can also live at the edges of forests and in places that people have changed. It can live in forests that have never been cut down and forests that were cut down and are growing back. Scientists saw the frog between 200 and 2500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in many protected places. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place that has so many good places for frogs to live in it. Humans do change the places where the frogs live to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
