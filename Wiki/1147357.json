For example, an Iraqi scholar named Ali Al-Wardi claimed that they're descended from the Nabataeans of Iraq and others. === 1950s-2003 === In the '50s, the Mesopotamian Marshes were drained, which made the wetlands look like a desert. The Ahwaris' population decreased to around 20,000, thanks to Saddam's retaliations. == Culture == === Agriculture === The Marsh Arabs' agriculture is split into two groups. The first one raises water buffaloes, while the other group cultivates rice, wheat, and other grains. === Mashoofs === The Marsh Arabs use a special type of canoe called a mashoof.
