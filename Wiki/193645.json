 "text": "LimeWire is an open source, peer-to-peer computer program that can be used to download and share music, video, other computer programs, and other kinds of files. In 2010 the Recording Industry Association of America took the makers of LimeWire to the federal court in New York. They said that the software allowed people to download and share music, which was against the law. In June 2010, the National Music Publishers Association also took legal action against LimeWire. LimeWire was shut down in October 2010. ==References== Category:File sharing software",
