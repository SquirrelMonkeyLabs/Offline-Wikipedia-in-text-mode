 "text": "Vasaloppet is an annual cross-country skiing competition in Sweden. It started off in 1922 and has been a part of Worldloppet as long as Worldloppet has been around. Nowadays it is held the first Sunday in March each year. The competition runs from SÃ¤len to Mora. Women were banned from participating between 1924 and 1980, due to the length of the race (90 kilometers). In 1997, an official women's award was established. The race is held to commemorate the historical events related to Gustav Vasa back in the early 1520's. ==Sister races== *Botniavasan (Finland) *Vasaloppet China *Vasaloppet Japan *Vasaloppet USA *Vasaloppet de la Sergerie (Canada) ==Related pages== *Tjejvasan == References == ==Other websites== * Official website *The event at SVT's open archive Category:1922 establishments in Sweden Category:Sports competitions Category:Skiing in Sweden",
