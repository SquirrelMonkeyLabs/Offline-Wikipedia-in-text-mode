 "text": "Throw up or throwie is one of the three basic forms of graffiti. The term itself is derived from the English colloquial expression \"throw up\" (to hurl), which reflects the idea that the letters (or other types of symbols) are designed to be written (thrown) onto a surface as quickly as possible. By definition, a throw up should be simple, easy and quick to execute, and easy to remember. == Form == Throw ups are usually the writer's nickname, but not their real name. They are written in round shapes like bubbles. Sometimes they have a colour on the inside, called a fill, but sometimes they do not. Throw ups without a fill are called hollows. Sometimes throw ups only have the first two letters of the writers nickname, because it is faster, especially if their nickname is long. Throw ups are usually done with the writer moving their whole body in a way they have practiced to do quickly a lot before. This speed means that writers can make lots of throw ups very quickly. A good throw up has the letters all the same height, the top of the letters the same shape, and bottom of the letters the same shape, not much empty space, and clean lines. Sometimes it isn't easy to decide if something is a throw up or a piece, but throw ups are usually faster to paint, have less colours, and the writer cares more about being fast that making it pretty. == History == Throw ups started in the New York City Subway in the 1970s and as bigger versions of tags before changing into their own style. Compared to tags and pieces, throw ups have not changed much since people started making them. == References == category: Graffiti",
