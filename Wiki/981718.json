In November 1992, the band made a demo named The Kitchen Tape. The demo was noticed by Geffen Records, a record label. The band joined the label to make the album. The label wanted them to have a producer instead of producing the album by themselves. Weezer chose Ric Ocasek, because they liked how he produced music for the Cars. The album was recorded from August to September 1993. Jason Cropper, the band's guitarist, was fired while they were making the album. He was replaced with Brian Bell. Weezer had three singles: \"Undone – The Sweater Song\", \"Buddy Holly\", and \"Say It Ain't So\". The music videos for these songs were popular on MTV. The album reached number 16 on the Billboard 200, a record chart. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\"American album certifications – Weezer – Weezer\".
