 "text": "South Africa was first at the Olympic Games in 1904, and sent athletes toevery Summer Olympic Games until 1960. After the passage of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761 in 1962 in response to South Africa's policy of apartheid, the nation was barred from the Games. After the negotiations to end apartheid in 1990, the nation re-joined the Olympic movement. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee was formed in 1991, and South Africa returned to the Games at the 1992 Summer Olympics (and the 1992 Summer Paralympics). South Africa was also in the Winter Olympic Games in 1960, and since 1994. ==Medalists== Medal Name Games Sport Event Athletics Men's 100 metres Athletics Men's Marathon Athletics Men's Marathon Cycling Men's Individual Time Trial Tennis Men's Doubles Outdoor Tennis Men's Singles Outdoor Athletics Men's Marathon Tennis Men's Singles Outdoor Athletics Men's 400 Metres Boxing Men's Bantamweight Tennis Men's Singles Athletics Men's 400 Metres Relay Cycling Men's Individual Time Trial Cycling Men's Tandem Shooting Men's Team 600 Metres Military Rifle Athletics Men's 800m Cycling Team Pursuit Tennis Men's Singles Boxing Men's Bantamweight Athletics Men's 110m Hurdles Athletics Men's 10 Kilometer Walk Athletics Men's 110m Hurdles Boxing Men's Bantamweight Swimming Women's 4 × 100 m Freestyle Relay Boxing Men's lightweight Boxing Men's light-heavyweight Athletics Women's 80m hurdles Boxing Men's middleweight Swimming Women's 400m freestyle Boxing Men's featherweight Boxing Men's lightweight Boxing Men's light-heavyweight Boxing Men's featherweight Boxing Men's heavyweight Athletics Women's high jump Swimming Women's 100m backstroke Athletics Women's 100m Boxing Men's light-middleweight Thomas Shardelow Cycling (Track) Men's 2000m tandem Robert Fowler Thomas Shardelow Alfred Swift Cycling (Track) Men's team pursuit (4000m) Boxing Men's flyweight Boxing Men's featherweight Boxing Men's heavyweight Cycling (Track) Men's 1 km time trial /Stockholm Boxing Men's heavyweight /Stockholm Boxing Men's light- welterweight /Stockholm Cycling (Track) Men's 1 km time trial Jeanette Myburgh Natalie Myburgh Susan Elizabeth Roberts /Stockholm Swimming Women's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay Boxing Men's heavyweight Athletics Men's 400m Boxing Men's featherweight Athletics Women's 10,000m Piet Norval Tennis Men's Doubles Athletics Men's marathon Swimming Women's 100m breaststroke Swimming Women's 200m breaststroke Athletics Men's 800m Swimming Women's 100m backstroke Athletics Women's high jump Swimming Men's 200m breaststroke Athletics Men's 400m hurdles Athletics Men's discus throw Swimming Women's 100m breaststroke Ryk Neethling Roland Mark Schoeman Darian Townsend Swimming Men's 4 × 100 m freestyle relay Athletics Men's 800m Athletics Women's high jump Swimming Men's 100m freestyle Ramon di Clemente Rowing Men's coxless pair Swimming Men's 50m freestyle Athletics Men's long jump Rowing Men's Lightweight Four Swimming Men's 100m breaststroke Swimming Men's 200m butterfly Athletics Women's 800m Swimming Men's 100m butterfly Canoeing Women's K-1 500m Athletics Men's 400m Athletics Women's 800m Swimming Men's 200m freestyle Rowing Men's coxless pair Swimming Men's 100m butterfly Swimming Men's 100m breaststroke Athletics Men's long jump Athletics Women's javelin throw Rugby Sevens Men's tournament Henri Schoeman Triathlon Men's Triathlon ==Related pages== * List of IOC country codes == References == ==Other websites == * South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee * South Africa profile at London2012.com Category:Nations at the Olympics Category:Sport in South Africa Category:National sports teams of South Africa",
