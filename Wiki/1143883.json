 "text": "The Māori King movement, called the in Māori, is a Māori movement that came from some of the Māori tribes of New Zealand in the 1850s. They wanted to create a role that was similar to that of the monarch of the British colonists. The first Māori king, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, was crowned in 1858. The monarchy is non-hereditary as every monarch has to be elected by a forum of tribal leaders. The eighth monarch is Ngā Wai Hono i te Pō, was elected and crowned in September 2024. ==List of Māori monarchs== Portrait (Birth–Death) Reign Reign Birth name Spouse(s) House Start End 1 Pōtatau Te Wherowhero died 1860 June 1858 25 June 1860 Te Wherowhero Whakaawi, Waiata, Raharaha, Ngāwaero Te Wherowhero 2 Tūkaroto Matutaera Pōtatau Te Wherowhero Tāwhiao c. 1822–1894 25 June 1860 26 August 1894 Tūkaroto Pōtatau Te Wherowhero Hera Ngāpora, Rangiaho Taimana, Aotea Te Paratene Te Wherowhero 3 Mahuta Tāwhiao Pōtatau Te Wherowhero c. 1854/55–1912 26 August 1894 9 November 1912 Whatiwhatihoe Te Marae Te Wherowhero 4 Te Rata Mahuta Tāwhiao Pōtatau Te Wherowhero c. 1878–1933 24 November 1912 1 October 1933 Te Rata Mahuta Te Uranga Te Wherowhero 5 Korokī Te Rata Mahuta Tāwhiao Pōtatau Te Wherowhero 1906–1966 8 October 1933 18 May 1966 Korokī Te Rata Mahuta Tāwhiao Pōtatau Te Wherowhero Te Atairangikaahu Hērangi Te Wherowhero 6 Te Atairangikaahu 1931–2006 23 May 1966 15 August 2006 Pikimene Korokī Mahuta Whatumoana Paki Te Wherowhero 7 Tūheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero 1955–2024 21 August 2006 30 August 2024 Tūheitia Paki Te Atawhai Te Wherowhero 8 Ngā Wai Hono i te Pō Pōtatau Te Wherowhero b. 1997 5 September 2024 present Nga wai hono i te po Paki Te Wherowhero ==Notes== ==References== *",
