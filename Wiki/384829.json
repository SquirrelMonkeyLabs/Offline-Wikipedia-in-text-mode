 "text": "The bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), also known as the lammergeier or lammergeyer, is a bird of prey. It is the only member of the genus Gypaetus. An Old World vulture, it forms a minor line of the Accipitridae with the Egyptian vulture, its closest living relative. They are not much more closely related to the Old World vultures proper than to hawks. They differ from Old World vultures by their feathered neck. It eats mainly carrion and lives and breeds on crags in high mountains in southern Europe, the Caucasus, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Tibet.Gavashelishvili A. & McGrady M.J. 2006.
