In Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Distributed Statistical Computing. This language is mostly compatible with MATLAB.This means that everything available at MATLAB is mostly available in GNU Octave. ==Usage== GNU Octave was originally made for numerical analysis. But today, it is also used for the following purposes (the purposes may increase in the future): * Interval arithmetic Heimlich, O. (2016, June). Interval arithmetic in GNU Octave.
