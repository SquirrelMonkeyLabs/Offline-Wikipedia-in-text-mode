 "text": "Gosford is an electoral district of New South Wales. It was created in 1950. Gosford is on the Central Coast and is based around the suburb of Gosford. The boundaries of Gosford have changed since it was created. In 2007, a redistribution on the Central Coast moved where Gosford was. ABC election scientist Antony Green said the redistribution basically meant that the old seat of Peats (a Labor seat) was renamed Gosford while the old seat of Gosford (a Liberal seat) was renamed Terrigal, with minor boundary changes. ==Election results== ==References== Gosford",
