 "text": "The San Carlos tree frog or San Carlos dwarf tree frog (Dendropsophus phelobodes) is a frog that lives in Nicaragua, Panama, and Colombia. Scientists have seen it below 700 meters above sea level. The adult male frog can be as large as 23.6 mm from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be 28.2 mm. This frog's head is as wide as its body is. This frog is yellow to light brown in color with darker brown marks. Some have narrow white stripes. This frog eats insects, spiders, and other animals without spines. This frog can lay eggs at any time of year, but it lays eggs mostly when the weather turns rainy. The male frog sits 1 to 2 meters off the ground on a plant and sings for the females. They do this near temporary bodies of water, for example flooded fields. They do this most on the third day after a big rain. The eggs float on the water or stick to plants. The scientific name phlebodes comes from the Greek word \"phlebos\" for \"vein,\" from the colored markings on the frog's back. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
