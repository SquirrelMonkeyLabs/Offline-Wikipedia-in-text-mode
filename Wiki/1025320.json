 "text": "The Malabar flying frog, Malabar gliding frog, or flying frog (Rhacophorus malabaricus) is a frog. It lives in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Phillippines. Scientists sometimes wonder if a frog is R. malabaricus or another species, R. pseudomalabaricus. They say one good way to tell these two frogs apart is to look at where the frog lives: R. pseudomalabaricus lives high than 955 meters above sea level. If the frog is close to sea level, it is probably R. malabaricus, and if it is high up in the hills, it is probably R. pseudomalabaricus. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
