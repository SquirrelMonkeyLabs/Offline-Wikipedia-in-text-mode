 "text": "47 Ursae Majoris b or Taphau Thong is an extrasolar gas planet around 46 light-years from our solar system in the 47 Ursae Majoris system. The planet is 2.5 times the mass of Jupiter with gravity that's six to eight times stronger than that of Earth. The gravitational interaction of Taphau Thong's highly elliptical orbit precludes any habitable planets in its system, although it is possible that some of the planet's potentialnatural satellites could be habitable thanks to tidal heating.
