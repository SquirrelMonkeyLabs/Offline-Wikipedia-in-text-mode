 "text": "In physics, the weber (symbol: Wb; , , or ) is the SI unit of magnetic flux. A flux density of one Wb/m2 (one weber per square meter) is one tesla. The weber is named for the German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804–1891). == Definition == The weber may be defined in terms of Faraday's law, which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop. A change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt (produce an electric potential difference of one volt across two open-circuited terminals). Officially, > Weber (unit of magnetic flux) — The weber is the magnetic flux which, > linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of > 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second. In SI base units, the dimensions of the weber are (kg·m2)/(s2·A). Many times, the weber is expressed in terms of other derived units as the Tesla-square meter (T·m2), volt-seconds (V·s), or joules per ampere (J/A). :1 Wb = 1 V·s = 1 T·m2 = 1 J/A = 108 Mx (maxwells). == References == Category:SI derived units Category:Magnetism",
