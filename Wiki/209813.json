 "text": "The UK Singles Chart is made by Official Charts Company (OCC) for the British record industry. The full chart lists the top 100 singles. These are judged by combined record sales, downloads, streams and YouTube video views, though some media outlets only list the Top 40 (such as the BBC) or the Top 75 (such as Music Week Magazine) of this list. Around 6,500 UK stores help with sales data, as well as most UK online digital download stores. Unlike in the U.S., no airplay statistics are used for the official UK Singles Chart. The chart week runs starts on Friday and goes to Thursday. Most UK singles are released on Fridays. ==Other websites== * The Official UK Charts Company * BBC Radio 1 Top 40 * British Chart Books Classified Category:British record charts Category:British music",
