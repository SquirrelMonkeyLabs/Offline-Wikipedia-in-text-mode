It lives in India, Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. This is a small frog. The adult male frog is 25 - 27 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 29 - 34 mm long. It has a pointed nose. The skin of the frog's back is bright yellow or brown in color. There are brown stripes on the back. The backs of the legs are purple in color. Sometimes there are black stripes on the purple parts of the legs. Parts of the neck are white in color. The bottoms of the back legs are red in color. There are disks on the toes for climbing. This frog lives in trees. People see this frog in forests where the tree branches come together like a roof and in grassy places. People have also found it sitting on rice plants and near railroad tracks. They see this frog between 8 and 1630 meters above sea level. The female frog finds a body of water that dries up for part of the year. She lays her eggs on leaves, on the side of the leaf facing the ground. Scientists believe the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place, and some of those places are protected parks: Phou Louey National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos and Lawachara National Park in Bangladesh. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, especially for things to sell, for example, coffee, rubber, and tea. Scientists named this frog for animal scientist Giacomo Doria. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
