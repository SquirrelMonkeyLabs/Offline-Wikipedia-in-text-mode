 "text": "\"Jocelyn Flores\" is the second single off of American rapper XXXTentacion's debut studio album 17. The song was released on October 31, 2017. The song was able to make it to #19 on the Billboard Hot 100. XXXTentacion made the song in tribute to his friend Jocelyn Arnold Flores, who committed suicide when visiting him in Florida. XXXTentacion had hired her to be a model for his clothing line, Revenge. While he was out, Flores and another girl got into an argument and blamed each other after $7,000 was stolen from his bag. Flores was fired from her modelling job by him and both of the girls were kicked out of the house. Flores checked into a hotel room and committed suicide. Some of her family were honored that XXXTentacion made the song about her and some really did not like that he did not ask for their permission first. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2017 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
