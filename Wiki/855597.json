The increase in numbers and the starting of Intermediate classes required larger accommodation and the foundation stone of the present buildings was laid on 17 February 1868 by General Keating, the Agent to the Governor-General in Rajputana. In the early nineties of the last century, the public of Ajmer collected a sum of Rs 44,000/- and handed it over to the Government as their contribution for the college. Degree classes in Arts subjects were started in 1896 and in Science subjects in 1913. A year earlier the school classes had been separated from the college and shifted to another part of the town. In the year 1946 came the first postgraduate department. There are 19 of them now including Law. Degree classes in Commerce were added in 1949 and Law classes in 1951.
