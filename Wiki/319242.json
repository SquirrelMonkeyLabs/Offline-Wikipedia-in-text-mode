 "text": "The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season had a little less storms than usual, 11 storms, and four of them reached hurricane status. It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30. This is when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic. However the first named storm, Ana, developed nearly a month before the official start of the season, the first time this has happened since 2012’s Beryl and the earliest a hurricane has happened since 2003’s Ana. The season ended with the diminish of Kate 18 days before the official end. Due to a strong El Niño, most agencies predicted that only 6–10 tropical cyclones would form; however, the number of tropical cyclones that formed this season was higher than what the agencies predicted. == Retirement == In the spring of 2016, the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) had retired the names Erika and Joaquin. Those names will not be used again in the Atlantic. Elsa and Julian were chosen to replace those names for the 2021 season. Category:Atlantic hurricane seasons Atlantic hurricane season",
