 "text": "\"Wildflowers\" is a song by Tom Petty and the opening track from the album of the same name. The song became very popular in concerts. Even though it was not released as a single, it charted at #16 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart, at #11 on the Billboard Rock Digital Song Sales and at #3 on the Billboard Lyric Find. AllMusic said that the song was \"simple\" and sounded like folk-country music. It has become a very popular song of Petty's. He also stated \"Wildflowers\" was easy to write and compose. He said that it took three and a half minutes to write the song, without any revisions needed. He said he took \"a deep breath and it came out. The whole song. Stream of consciousness: words, music, chords. Finished it. I mean, I just played it into a tape recorder and I played the whole song and I never played it again.\" The title of the November 2020 book Somewhere You Feel Free: Tom Petty and Los Angeles comes from a lyric in the song. \"Wildflowers\" is also Tom Petty's fourth most streamed solo song (and seventh overall) on Spotify, even passing the same album's big hit \"You Don't Know How It Feels\". ==References== Category:Tom Petty songs Category:1994 songs Category:Folk rock songs",
