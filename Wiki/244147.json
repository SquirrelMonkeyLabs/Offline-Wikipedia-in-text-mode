 "text": "Explosion protection is meant to protect buildings and other civil engineering objects against internal and external explosions. It was widely believed until recently that a building subject to an explosive attack had a chance to remain standing only if it possessed some extraordinary resistive capacity. This belief rested on the assumption that the blast load was fully beyond our control. ==Two approaches to explosion protection== :1. Prevention. Prevention makes an explosion impossible to occur. :2. Structural control. Structural control will limit structural damage from explosion pressure and flying debris. ==Other websites== * Curtain Wall Testing * Designing Buildings to Resist Explosive Threats * The world's top Blast Protection websites ==References== Category:Explosives Category:Buildings and structures Category:Terrorism",
