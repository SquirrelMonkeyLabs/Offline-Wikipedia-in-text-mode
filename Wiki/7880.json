 "text": "Nigger is a racist insult against black people. It is commonly used by those who believe that their people are better than black people. ==Origin== The word came from a slang way to say \"negro\". That is the word for the color black and for black people in Spanish and Portuguese. ==History== Before 1865, most black people in the United States were slaves. During that time, the word nigger commonly meant a slave. Writers such as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens often used the word in their stories and their other writing. However, in the late 20th century, the word was seen as a hurtful racial slur. It was called hate speech. Nigger was seen as very offensive to say or hear which caused many to not use the word. They would call it \"the n-word\" instead of saying it. Some black people use the word without trying to insult people with it. More black people say nigga instead, which is considered less insulting. Nigga can also be called \"the n-word\". The word \"nigger\" may be called the \"hard-R\" to distinguish it from nigga. In the 21st century, the word gеr was \"taken back by black people\" and is now used commonly as a slang word in the speech of black people. Campaigns were also made to normalize the usage of the word gеr amongst all people. == Related pages == * Racism * Discrimination * Jim Crow laws * African Americans * Racial segregation * History of racial segregation in the United States ===Other slurs=== * Gook * Kike * Chink * Retard ==References== Category:Slurs Category:Racism Category:Discrimination Category:English profanity",
