 "text": "MTV Unplugged in New York is a live album by the American rock band Nirvana. It was recorded on November 18, 1993 as a part of the MTV Unplugged television series, which many artists and bands perform on with acoustic instruments instead of electric ones. It was released on November 1, 1994, six months after the band had broken up because of the death of Kurt Cobain, who was the lead singer and guitarist. It was unusual compared to other artists on the MTV Unplugged series, because Nirvana played mostly their less-famous songs and cover versions of other artists' songs. Most artists on the program played mainly their hits. Four singles were released from the album. This was unusual because it was a live album. The singles were \"About a Girl\", \"The Man Who Sold the World\", \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\", and \"Lake of Fire\". All of these except for \"About a Girl\" were covers. ==List of songs== #\"About a Girl\" #\"Come as You Are\" #\"Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam\" (The Vaselines cover) #\"The Man Who Sold the World\" (David Bowie cover) #\"Pennyroyal Tea\" #\"Dumb\" #\"Polly\" #\"On a Plain\" #\"Something in the Way\" #\"Plateau\" (Meat Puppets cover) #\"Oh Me\" (Meat Puppets cover) #\"Lake of Fire\" (Meat Puppets cover) #\"All Apologies\" #\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\" (traditional; Lead Belly version cover) ==References== Category:Nirvana (band) albums Category:1993 albums Category:MTV Unplugged albums",
