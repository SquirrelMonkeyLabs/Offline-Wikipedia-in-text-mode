 "text": "The rockhole frog, Australian cross-banded tree frog or skipping frog (Litoria meiriana) is a small frog from Australia. It lives in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Male adult frogs are about 2 cm long and females are 2.2 cm long. They have webbed hind feet but their front feet are not webbed. Some are dark brown with dark green spots and some are less clear. Some have spots on their thighs. Some have white spots near their eyes. They live near permanent bodies of water and do not like puddles or vernal pools that dry up. They live in holes in rocks and sometimes in caves or near waterfalls. They are so light that they can skip on the surface of the water like a skipping stone. They lay eggs in pools near the bottoms of tall rocks, 30-40 eggs at a time. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
