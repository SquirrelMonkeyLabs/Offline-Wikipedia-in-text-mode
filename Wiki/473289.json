In December 2006, before the movie's premiere, it gained some criticism from religious groups because of its graphic content in a holiday setting, and the distributor's choice to release the movie on Christmas Day in the United States. The movie gained negative reviews from critics and holds a 14% \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Sam Adams of the Los Angeles Times was quoted as saying \"Like an ugly tie or a pair of slipper socks, Black Christmas is destined to be forgotten the instant it's unwrapped, gathering dust until the season rolls around again\". == Cast == * Katie Cassidy as Kelli Presley * Michelle Trachtenberg as Melissa Kitt * Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Heather Lee-Fitzgerald * Lacey Chabert as Dana Mathis * Kristen Cloke as Leigh Colvin * Andrea Martin as Barbara MacHenry/Mrs. Mac * Crystal Lowe as Lauren Hannon * Oliver Hudson as Kyle Autry * Karin Konoval as Constance Lenz * Dean Friss as Agnes Lenz ** Christina Crivici as 8-year-old Agnes * Robert Mann as William Billy Lenz ** Cainan Wiebe as young Billy * Jessica Harmon as Megan Helms * Leela Savasta as Clair Crosby * Kathleen Kole as Eve Agnew * Howard Siegel as Beauregard Rice * Peter Wilds as Frank Lenz ==References== == Other websites == * Category:2006 horror movies Category:American horror movies Category:American movie remakes Category:American teen horror movies Category:Canadian horror movies Category:Christmas movies Category:2000s English-language movies Category:Incest in movies Category:Movies set in Massachusetts Category:Movies set in the 1970s Category:Movies set in the 1980s Category:Movies set in the 1990s",
