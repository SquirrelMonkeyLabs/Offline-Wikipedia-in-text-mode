The song was the second and final single released to promote the movie The Fighting Temptations, in which Knowles plays the leading lady. The song is not featured in the movie but is part of the official soundtrack. It first appeared as a B-side to Knowles' 2003 smash hit \"Crazy in love\". As it was released just seven days after the third single from Knowles' Dangerously in Love, \"Me, Myself and I\", the song did not become a big hit and an official music video was never shot for it. The song however was part of the set list on Knowles' Dangerously in Love World Tour. ==Official versions== *Summertime (A Cappella featuring Diddy) *Summertime (featuring Diddy) *Summertime (movie Version) *Summertime (Instrumental) *Summertime (Remix - A Cappella featuring Ghostface Killah) *Summertime (Remix featuring Ghostface Killah) *Summertime (Without Rap) ==Charts== Chart (2003) Peak position U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs 35 Category:Beyoncé songs Category:2003 songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Hip hop soul songs Category:R&B; songs",
