He is known for his sketch-comedy videos, parody, Lets-Play and conspiracy theory videos. In July 2015, Dawson came out as bisexual. ==Controversy== Dawson has faced some controversy in his career. Past videos where he portrayed African-American celebrities, said the racial slur \"nigger\" many times and wore blackface went viral which Dawson would apologize for. He would also garner controversy for comments he made about pedophilia and bestiality with his cat. He would also apologize for these. After an old skit of Dawson where he pretended to masturbate to a poster of a then-11 year old Willow Smith went viral, Willow's brother Jaden and mother Jada would say that they are \"done with the excuses\". Target would remove his books from their stores and YouTube would demonetize all three of Dawson's channels. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:LGBT actors Category:LGBT comedians Category:American LGBT writers Category:Bisexual people Category:American YouTubers Category:Movie directors from Los Angeles County, California Category:Actors from Long Beach, California Category:Comedians from Los Angeles County, California Category:Writers from Los Angeles County, California Category:LGBT people from California",
