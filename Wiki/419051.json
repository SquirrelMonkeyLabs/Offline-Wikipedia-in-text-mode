 "text": "Purple bacteria are bacteria that are phototrophic, meaning that they are able to make energy from light. They change the energy from the Sun into chemical energy that they can use to function. They do this through photosynthesis. Purple bacteria belong to the group called proteobacteria. They are called purple bacteria because they are often purple in colour. They can also be red, brown and orange. == References == Category:Gram-negative bacteria",
