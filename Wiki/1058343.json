 "text": "The WAGR Ec class were a total of 20 heavy-duty steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1901 to 1925. The Ec class were built by the Baldwin Locomotives Works (BLW) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA as compounds in place of the awaiting E class, which were also 4-6-2s from Britain. They were assembled at Fremantle Railway Workshops and entered service on the Eastern Goldfields Railway from Northam to Southern Cross. Some were converted to weigh less to work on lighter-laid lines, being classed the Eca class. Overall the engines were considered a success and were significantly rebuilt from 1923 to 1925 like other aging locomotives that were considered a success, in this form they were reclassified the L class.
