 "text": "\"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor from her debut major-label studio album Title (2015), featuring guest vocals from John Legend. Trainor wrote the song with Justin Weaver and Caitlyn Smith, and produced it with Chris Gelbuda. Epic Records released it as the album's fourth single on June 23, 2015. A soul love ballad, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" is about moments spent with loved ones and not taking them for granted. Critics praised Trainor's vocals and the song's composition, but some thought its mellow style did not suit her. In the United States, \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified 4× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It peaked at number one in Australia, New Zealand, and Poland, and got 5× Platinum certifications in Australia and Canada. Constellation Jones directed the music video for \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\", featuring Trainor singing in a candlelit room on a rainy night while people in relationships are shown interacting with their loved ones. Trainor performed the song on television shows such as the Billboard Music Awards, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and the American Music Awards, and included it on the set lists of her concert tours That Bass Tour (2015), MTrain Tour (2015), and The Untouchable Tour (2016). ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart positions for \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" Chart (2015–2016) Peak position Ireland (IRMA) 96 Poland (Polish Airplay Top 100) 1 Slovenia (SloTop50) 39 South Africa (EMA) 6 ===Year-end charts=== 2015 year-end chart positions for \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" Chart (2015) Position Australia (ARIA) 23 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) 16 US Billboard Hot 100 76 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 28 US Adult Top 40 (Billboard) 29 2016 year-end chart positions for \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" Chart (2016) Position Canada (Canadian Hot 100) 47 US Billboard Hot 100 42 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard) 7 US Adult Top 40 (Billboard) 22 US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) 41 ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2010s ballads Category:2014 songs Category:Meghan Trainor songs Category:Soul ballads",
