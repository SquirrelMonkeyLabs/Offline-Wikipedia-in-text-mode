 "text": "A thesaurus is a dictionary of synonyms (words that have the same or similar meaning). Thesauruses (or thesauri) often include related words that mean almost the same thing. Some thesauruses also include antonyms (words that have the opposite meaning). For example, by looking up the word \"big\" in a thesaurus, someone would find a list of other similar words such as \"huge\" and \"massive\". If the thesaurus also has a list of antonyms, the user could also find words which mean the opposite, like \"small\" and \"tiny\". Many students and writers use a thesaurus to help them find words when they are writing. Using a thesaurus can help a person to improve their vocabulary (the number of words that they know). == Related pages == *Wiktionary == Other websites == * Power Thesaurus - website with lists of synonyms and antonyms ordered by rating * Thesaurus.com - website with detailed options for each word * Visual Synonyms - website with visualization of synonyms and antonyms Category:Reference works Category:Vocabulary",
