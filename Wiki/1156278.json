 "text": "The Chevrolet Orlando is a three-row compact MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) made by General Motors under the Chevrolet brand. It was made from 2010 to 2023. The first version of the Orlando was mainly produced in South Korea, but it was also made in other countries. ==First Generation (2010-2018)== The first generation of the Chevrolet Orlando was unveiled in 2008 as a concept at the Paris Motor Show and the North American International Auto Show. The production model was first shown at the 2010 Busan International Motor Show. Production started in South Korea in October 2010 at the Gunsan assembly plant. The Orlando was designed using the platform from the Chevrolet Cruze sedan, and it had a rugged look, similar to a crossover. It was marketed as an \"Active Life Vehicle\" and was sold in South Korea starting in February 2011. The Orlando came with several engine options, including petrol, diesel, and LPG engines, with both manual and automatic transmissions. ==Second Generation (2018–2023)== The second generation of the Chevrolet Orlando was launched in 2018. Unlike the first version, this model was made and sold only in China by the SAIC-GM joint venture. It was available in 5-seater and 7-seater versions. The second-generation Orlando was powered by a 1.35 L turbocharged three- cylinder engine producing 156 horsepower. It also had an optional Redline Package, which increased the engine output to 161 horsepower. ==Markets== The Chevrolet Orlando was sold in many markets around the world, but it was not sold in the United States. It was available in South Korea, Europe, Canada, Latin America, and other Asian countries. In Canada, the Orlando was sold starting in mid-2011 and was available until 2015. In Europe, it was sold from 2011 until 2014. After 2014, most of Chevrolet's vehicles were no longer sold in Europe, except for sports cars like the Chevrolet Camaro. In Russia, the Orlando was available until 2015, before being discontinued. ==Discontinuation== The production of the first-generation Chevrolet Orlando ended in 2018. This was when production moved to China for the second generation, which continued until 2023. The first-generation Orlando was discontinued in South Korea after the closure of the Gunsan plant. The second- generation model, made only in China, was not sold in other countries after 2023, marking the end of the Orlando’s production. ==References== Orlando Category:2010s automobiles Category:2020s automobiles",
