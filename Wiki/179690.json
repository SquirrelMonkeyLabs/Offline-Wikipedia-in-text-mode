The next two years, in 1967 and 1968, the state championship was again won. His good performances at Grêmio led to Everaldo being called up to the Brazil national football team for the first time in 1967 for the games against Uruguay in the battle for the Copa Rio Branco. After three draws, it was decided to share the title. In 1970, national coach Mário Zagallo included him in Brazil 's squad for the 1970 World Cup, which took place in Mexico.
