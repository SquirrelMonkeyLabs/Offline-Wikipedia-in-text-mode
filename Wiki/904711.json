 "text": "The spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) is a mole salamander found in parts of USA and Canada. ==Characteristics== The spotted salamander is around 20cm long, black with yellow spots. Most of their life they live underground and only come out for breeding or after rainy weather. In the winter they brumate and don't come out of dormancy until around April, when they mate. Spotted salamanders together with other types of salamanders can regenerate body parts like legs, tail and other organs although it takes a lot of energy. Their egg masses are jelly and are polymorphic, since some of their egg masses are transparent while some are white. ==References== Category:Salamanders Category:Animals of North America",
