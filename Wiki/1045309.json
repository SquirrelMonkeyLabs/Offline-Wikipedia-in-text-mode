 "text": "A plus-size model is a female model, who has a clothing size that is bigger than the size 34/36 used for women. Usually they were clothing sizes 40 to about 52.They are also called Curvy models. Some of the models criticize the naming. They want to drop the \"plus\" from the name, and be considered normal. Very often, they advertise clothing that normal women can actually wear. Many are also active in stock photography. Some are advertising products other than clothing, for example cosmetics or sunglasses. Other names used include \"full- figured model\", \"extended-sizes model\", \"over-weight model\", and \"outsize model\". Previously, the term \"large size model\" was also frequently used.

By the early 1920s, Lane Bryant started selling clothing under the category 'For the Stout Women', which ranged between a 38–56 inch bustline. The earliest catalogs used illustrations to sell their products, but by the mid-1950s photographs were integrated into the catalogs as the evolution of printing technology made this option available. After a hiatus through the 1960–1980 period, Lane Bryant again began using plus-size models. Evans, a U.K.-based retailer, was founded in 1930. Evans specializes in plus-sized clothing, lingerie, shoes and swimwear. Max Mara started Marina Rinaldi, one of the first high-end clothing lines, for plus-size women in 1980. Marina Rinaldi started advertising in 1981. The line's campaigns were photographed by top photographers such as Richard Avedon, Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort, Greg Kadel, Peter Lindbergh, and Craig McDean, used top models and celebrities(including Carré Otis, Candice Huffine, Crystal Renn, and Kate Dillon Levin), and were featured in magazines and on billboards. The ads were also the first to use the term plus size rather than outsize in Europe. == References == Category:Fashion",
