 "text": "Hafith or Hafiz (Arabic: حافظ قرآن or حافظ, plural huffaz), literally meaning 'guardian', is a term used by Muslims for people who have learnt completely the Qur'an by heart. == Overview == The Islamic prophet Muhammad lived in the 7th century CE, in Arabia. In those times, many people were not literate. The Arabs preserved their histories, genealogies, and poetry by memory alone. When Muhammad proclaimed the verses later collected as the Qur'an, his followers naturally learnt the words by heart. ==Related pages== * Qur'an == Other websites == * Qur'an and Hafiz Number on islam101.com * Qur'an recitation on YouTube * Qur'an recitation by a Muslim child on YouTube * Recitation by Sh.
