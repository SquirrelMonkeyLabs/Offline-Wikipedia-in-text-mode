 "text": "Agua Dulce is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. It is located on the Texas Mexican Railway at the intersection of Farm Road 70 and State Highway 44 in west-central Nueces County. It is named after the local creek of the same name, Agua Dulce is \"sweet water\" in Spanish. ==History== Founded sometime prior to 1900, a post office was granted in 1908 and the Agua Dulce Independent School District was founded two years later. The population of Agua Dulce was 100 in 1914. The school system merged with Bentonville about the time that the first seismographic survey in Nueces County was being conducted. This resulted in a minor oil boom with gas and oil wells developed. During WWII the population increased from 200 to 750. It has remained more or less at that level ever since. ==References== Category:Cities in Texas",
