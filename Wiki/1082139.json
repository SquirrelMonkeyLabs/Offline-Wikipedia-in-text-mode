 "text": "The Sri Lanka whipping frog or common hour-glass tree frog (Polypedates cruciger) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. People have seen them as high as 1600 meters above sea level. This frog can live in many different places, including forests that are growing back, banana farms, gardens, and buildings. Scientists have not seen them in forests that have never been cut. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. Scientists used to think this was the same species as Polypedates pseudocruciger, which lives in India's Western Ghat mountains. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
