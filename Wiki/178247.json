 "text": "Voter registration is needed in some democracies for citizens and residents to check in with some central registry so that they will be allowed to vote in elections. In Australia, for example, everyone over the age of 18 must register with the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Their names are then added to the electoral roll, a list of all people able to vote in future elections. Part of the AEC's job is make sure everyone who is allowed to vote is listed on the roll. They also have to make sure that people who have died are removed from the lists. ==References== Category:Voting systems",
