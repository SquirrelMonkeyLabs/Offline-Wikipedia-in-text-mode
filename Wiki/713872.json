 "text": "Tropical Storm Imelda was a weak though very catastrophic 2019 Atlantic tropical cyclone. The storm struck eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Imelda created a very serious flash flood event in both states. It was one of the wettest tropical cyclones in U.S. history, particularly in Texas. The Galveston/Houston area was especially hit hard by Imelda. Several people were killed due to flooding from the storm. The storm also led to several tornadoes in Texas and Louisiana. Imelda developed as a tropical storm near the southeast Texas coastline. The storm moved very slowly over southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas. ==References== Category:Hurricanes in Texas Category:2019 in the United States Category:2019 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Atlantic tropical storms",
