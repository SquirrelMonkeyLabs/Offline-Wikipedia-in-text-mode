He left the show in 1975 and his character was killed off. Stevenson was born in Normal, Illinois. His grandfather Adlai E. Stevenson was Vice-president of the United States to Grover Cleveland, and his second cousin, once removed Adlai Stevenson II was Governor of Illinois and unsuccessfully ran for President twice in the 1950s losing to Dwight D. Eisenhower both times. Stevenson, while recovering from bladder cancer, died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, aged 68. Ironically, Roger Bowen, who played Henry Blake in the 1970 movie version of M*A*S*H, died the day after Stevenson did. == Other websites == * Category:1929 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Deaths from bladder cancer Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American stage actors Category:American television presenters Category:Actors from Illinois Category:Golden Globe Award winning actors Category:People from Normal, Illinois",
