Scientists do not know much information about this frog. They think it lives in forests on hills and mountains. They think it lays eggs in clear, rocky streams. In 2017, scientists looked at this frog's DNA. They think it could be the same frog as Rhacophorus modestus. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
