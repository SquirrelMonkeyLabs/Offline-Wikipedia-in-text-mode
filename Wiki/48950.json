 "text": "Compressive stress is the stress on materials that leads to a smaller volume. By compressive stress the material is under compression. Compressive stress to bars, columns, etc. leads to shortening. One can increase the compressive stress until compressive strength is reached. Then materials will react with ductile behaviour (most metals, some soils and plastics) or with fracture in case of brittle materials (geomaterials, cast iron, glass, etc.). For example, if a cylinder is compressed under the action of the applied force, the restoring force per unit area is known as the compressive stress. It is one of the best stresses for chassis, so if you have a chassis report explain it well as it helps a lot. ==Related pages== *Tensile stress *Hooke's law Category:Engineering Category:Materials science Category:Solid mechanics",
