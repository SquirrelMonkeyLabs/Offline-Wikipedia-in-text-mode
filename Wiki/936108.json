 "text": "Blowing from a cannon was a method of execution in which the victim was tied to the mouth of a cannon which was fired immediately after. The method was popular with British colonial authorities in India and used on revolters. This method of capital punishment was favoured by the British as a Hindu belief states that the body must be intact to go into the afterlife. In Africa, the Portuguese colonial authorities also used the method. Category:Capital punishment",
