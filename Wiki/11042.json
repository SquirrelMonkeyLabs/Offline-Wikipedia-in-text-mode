 "text": "Madeleine of Valois (10 August 1520 â€“ 7 July 1537) was a French princess who briefly became Queen of Scotland as the first wife of King James V. Their marriage was part of the Treaty of Rouen, which aimed to strengthen the alliance between France and Scotland. Despite concerns about her poor health, Madeleine and James were married in January 1537 at Notre-Dame de Paris. After the wedding, Madeleine traveled to Scotland, but her health quickly worsened. Sadly, she passed away in July 1537, just six months after their marriage and less than two months after arriving in Scotland. Because of her short reign, she became known as the \"Summer Queen.
