 "text": "Concatenation is a simple concept from linguistics, mathematics and computer science. It is a way of making a new word (or string), by joining two (or more) other strings. For example, the concatenation of \"snow\" and \"ball\" is \"snowball\". In most languages if we write x = \"snow\" + \"ball\", then the value of x will be \"snowball\". But to do the same in SQL we would write \"snow\"||\"ball\". Category:Computer science",
