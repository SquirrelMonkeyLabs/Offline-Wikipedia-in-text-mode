Over time, the name \"Közért\" became a common term meaning 'grocery store'. == History == In 1911, the Municipal Committee of Budapest founded the Budapest Municipal Food Selling Facility, which was the precursor to Közért. Its main goal was to lower meat prices. It started with 14 stores and by 1939 had grown to 51. Over time, the range of products expanded, and the stores became popular. This facility operated until May 15, 1948. In May 1948 the Községi Élelmiszerkereskedelmi Rt. company was founded with a capital of 50 million HUF. Its abbreviation was KÖZÉRT. Its main task was to ensure public supply. At its founding, it had 358 stores in Budapest and 31 in the countryside. The number of stores in Budapest grew over time, while the rural stores were transferred to other retail networks. In August 1955, the company's first self-service store opened in Budapest. By the mid-1960s, nearly 50% of the company's stores were operating on a self-service basis.Magyar márkák története / Közért - Csemege - HVG, 2005.03.28. After privatization in 1989, Közért's stores were sold. Today's successors of Közért include, among others, CBA and SPAR. ==References== Category:Supermarkets of Hungary",
