 "text": "==List of Northeast Blackout Cities== Connecticut Massachusetts Michigan New Jersey New York Ohio Ontario Pennsylvania The Northeast blackout of 2003 was a big power outage that happened in many parts of the northeastern and midwestern United States, and the Canadian area of Ontario on Thursday, August 14, 2003, starting soon after 4:10 p.m. EDT. Most places got power back by midnight (in about 7 hours since it was lost), some as early as 6 p.m. on August 14 (in 2 hours since it was lost), while the New York City Subway started serving customers again by 8 p.m. Full power came back to New York City and Toronto on August 16. It was the world's second biggest blackout in history, second to the 1999 Southern Brazil blackout. The blackout happened because of a software problem in the alarm area of the control room of FirstEnergy. == References == Category:2003 in Canada Category:2003 in the United States Category:2000s disasters in the United States Category:2000s disasters in Canada Category:2003 disasters",
