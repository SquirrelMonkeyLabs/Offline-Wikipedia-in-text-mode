His family is of Italian and Lebanese descent. His grandfather, the son of an Italian immigrant, became a theater owner. He has a younger sister named Alejandra Darín who is also an actress. His parents separated when Ricardo was twelve years old. His father died of cancer in 1989. Regarding his training, he did his primary studies at the Mariano Moreno School in the town of Wilde. At the age of ten he debuted in theater with his parents, although he did not develop an academic training in theater. In 2006 the government of Spain granted him Spanish nationality by letter of nature that falls on foreigners who \"come in exceptional circumstances\", in his case for his acting merits in Spanish- speaking cinema. In 2022, the Uruguayan government granted him Uruguayan citizenship due to the prolonged stays that he maintains in the country every year to spend the summer with his family, a clause contemplated as \"nearness\" by the National Constitution to access citizenship. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine actors",
