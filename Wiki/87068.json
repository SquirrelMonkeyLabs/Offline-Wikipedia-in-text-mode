 "text": "A permutation is a single way of arranging a group of objects. It is useful in mathematics. A permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects. For example, the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation. If some of them chose different seats, then it would be a different permutation. ==Permutations without repetitions== The factorial has special application in defining the number of permutations in a set which does not include repetitions. The number n!, read \"n factorial\", is precisely the number of ways we can rearrange n things into a new order. For example, if we have three fruit: an orange, apple and pear, we can eat them in the order mentioned, or we can change them (for example, an apple, a pear then an orange). The exact number of permutations is then 3! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6. The number gets extremely large as the number of items (n) goes up. In a similar manner, the number of arrangements of r items from n objects is considered a partial permutation. It is written as nPr (which reads \"n permute r\"), and is equal to the number n (n-1) \\cdots (n - r + 1) (also written as n! / (n-r)!). == Related pages == * Combination (mathematics) * Superpermutation == References == Category:Combinatorics Category:Abstract algebra",
