 "text": "Duane Eddy (April 26, 1938 - April 30, 2024) was a Grammy Award-winning American rock guitarist. Many people enjoyed his music and tried to play the same way as he did. He is best known for the music that he played without singing words. He was probably best known for his hit song Rebel Rouser (1958). Released in 1960, Eddy was the first rock and roller to have a signature model guitar. Eddy died of cancer in Franklin, Tennessee, on April 30, 2024, four days after his 86th birthday. == References == Category:American rock guitarists Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:1938 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in Tennessee Category:Actors from New York (state) Category:Musicians from New York (state)",
