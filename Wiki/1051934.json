 "text": "The FTW (\"Fuck the World\") Championship was a professional wrestling championship. It was fought for in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from 1998–1999 and in All Elite Wrestling (AEW) from 2020–2024. It was viewed as an unsanctioned championship. ==History== The title was introduced by Taz at It Ain't Seinfeld on May 14, 1998. Taz was feuding with ECW World Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas but Douglas got injured and Taz couldn't challenge for the title. During the event, Taz went to the ring and cut a promo. He said that he was the uncrowned ECW World Heavyweight Champion, unveiled the ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship, and challenged Douglas to a title vs title match. Sabu won the championship by defeating Taz on December 19, 1998. Taz threw the match on purpose. Taz felt like he didn't need the championship anymore because Douglas was back. He had the ref count after dragging a knocked out Sabu on top of him. After Taz won the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, he faced Sabu again at Living Dangerously. He won the FTW Championship back in a title vs title match and retired the championship. While he was in All Elite Wrestling, Taz reintroduced the FTW Championship during Night 2 of Fyter Fest. He gave the championship to Brian Cage, who he managing at the time. He gave him the championship because his opponent Jon Moxley had to quarantine due to his wife Renee Paquette having COVID-19. On September 25, 2024 at Dynamite: Grand Slam, the FTW Championship was retired again after the last champion Hook returned the title to his father, Taz. == Title history == == References == == Other websites == *Official website Category:All Elite Wrestling championships Category:Extreme Championship Wrestling",
