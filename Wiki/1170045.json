 "text": "Inter-city rail services are express trains that run services that connect cities over longer distances than commuter or regional trains. They include rail services that are neither short-distance commuter rail trains within one city area nor slow regional rail trains stopping at all stations and covering local journeys only. An inter-city train is typically an express train with limited stops and comfortable carriages to serve long-distance travel. Inter- city rail sometimes provides international services. This is most prevalent in Europe because of the proximity of its 50 countries to a 10,180,000-square- kilometre (3,930,000-square-mile) area. The word InterCity or Inter-City is an official brand name in many European countries, for a network of regular- interval and relatively long-distance train services. The use of the term appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and has been widely imitated. ==References== Category:Rail transport",
