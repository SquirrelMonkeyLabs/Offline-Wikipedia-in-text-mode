 "text": "Mark Leschinsky is an American inventor and social entrepreneur. He is known for developing several patented inventions. Leschinsky has received recognition from organizations including the United Nations, the British Royal Family, and the New Jersey state government for his work. == Early life and education == Mark Leschinsky was born on March 8 in the United States. He grew up in Mahwah, New Jersey. According to the National Inventors Hall of Fame, he began thinking about inventions in his early childhood, recalling an idea to create a retractable umbrella that could extend from a car in the rain when he was 3-4 years old. Leschinsky attended the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, New Jersey, where he took multiple engineering courses. In 2024, he was named a Coca-Cola Scholar and graduated from high school. As of fall 2024, Leschinsky is a freshman at Stanford University. == Public appearances == Leschinsky has made several public appearances to discuss his work in engineering and social entrepreneurship. One of his earliest national television appearances was on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where he was featured as a \"kid inventor\" during the \"Fallonventions\" segment. On the show, Leschinsky presented one of his early inventions, the \"Eat-Corder,\" and appeared alongside guests Ann Makosinski and Andrew Burton. == Inventions == Leschinsky is a patented inventor with several inventions. During the Ebola epidemic, after learning about healthcare workers risking their lives treating Ebola patients, Leschinsky designed a multilayer air-pressure compression system that pumps disinfecting solution to address the problem of virus transfer when removing conventional hazmat suits. The suit contains pockets of disinfecting solution backed by air pockets that, when inflated, push the solution through a porous layer to the outside of the suit. This allows the disinfecting solution to trickle down the entire suit, enabling healthcare workers to safely remove it without risk of infection. This invention resulted in his induction to the National Gallery for America's Young Inventors at the National Museum of Education. His other inventions include the \"One-Pill-No- Spill Medicine Bottle,\" designed to help people with Parkinson's disease who struggle with hand tremors when taking medication, and \"The Fire Eye,\" a device designed to protect people from entering rooms with fires inside. The medicine bottle was inspired by his grandmother's Parkinson's disease and uses rubber bands to prevent spills and help people with hand tremors take only one pill at a time. == Related pages == * Gitanjali Rao == References == Category:American businesspeople Category:People from New Jersey",
