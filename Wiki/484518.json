 "text": "There are 2 arrondissements in the Landes department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of Landes are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 401 Dax Dax 220,656 3,194.2 152 402 Mont-de-Marsan Mont- de-Marsan 179,821 6,048.4 178 ==History== Since its creation, the Landes department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the Landes department with four districts: Dax, Mont-de-Marsan, Saint-Sever and Tartas; the capital was Mont-de-Marsan * 1800 : creation of the arrondissements: Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, Saint-Sever * 1926 : the arrondissement of Saint-Sever is eliminated and integrated into the remaining two arrondissements ==References== Landes",
