He helped to start the Royal Academy of Arts and was its first president.Sir Joshua Reynolds, National Portrait Gallery, London, accessed September 2009 King George III made him Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1769. Some critics disliked Reynolds and the Royal Academy. The Pre-Raphaelites called him \"Sir Sloshua\" and William Blake published a savage pamphlet Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses in 1808. On the other hand, Turner was a strong supporter, and asked to be buried at Reynolds' side. Reynolds has over 1000 portraits in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Despite Blake's criticisms, Reynold's Discourses had a lasting impact on the theory and practice of art. ==References== Category:1723 births Category:1792 deaths Category:English painters Category:People from Devon Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Royal Society of Arts Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Royal Academicians",
