 "text": "72 Feronia (minor planet designation: 72 Feronia) is a somewhat large and dark Main belt asteroid. It was the first asteroid that C. H. F. Peters discovered on May 29, 1861, in Hamilton College, New York. At first, people thought that Peters saw the already known asteroid 66 Maja. But T.H. Safford showed that it was a new body. Safford named it after Feronia, a Roman fertility goddess. ==References== Category:Asteroids",
