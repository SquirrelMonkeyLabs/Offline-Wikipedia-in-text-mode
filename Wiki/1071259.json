 "text": "The pinnacle bubble-nest frog (Philautus umbra) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia. Scientists think it might also live in Brunei. People have seen it between 900 and 1300 meters above sea level on Gunung Api. This frog lives in forests that are not on mountains, in places where there is karst rock in the ground. The male frog sits about 2 m over the ground. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
