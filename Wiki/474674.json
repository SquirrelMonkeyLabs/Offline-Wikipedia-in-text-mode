 "text": "is a Japanese pop singer and actress. She was one of the most popular singers of the 1980s in Japan. She is known for her deep, powerful voice. Within two years of her debut, she set herself apart from all the singers of her generation by singing provocative songs with the release of each new single. Her hair style and dress sense was very much copied by teenagers in the 1980s. Music wise, her recording company moulded her to be a successor after the mature and sophisticated Momoe Yamaguchi, a singer who retired at age 21 for marriage. Her songs were always of heartbreaks, or rebellion, never to stray far from the 'mold'. == Discography == === Singles === #1 May 1982 Slow Motion (Joken Hansha) #28 July 1982 Shōjo A (Yume Handan) #10 November 1982 Second Love (Kagami no Naka no J) #23 February 1983 Nibunnoichi no Shinwa (Nukumori) #1 June 1983 Twilight -
