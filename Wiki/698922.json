 "text": "Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81 is a live album comprised of recordings of Pink Floyd's tour of The Wall. == Track listing == == Background == Is There Anybody Out There? contains live versions of the songs off of The Wall. Some extra tracks are added, \"What Shall We Do Now?\" and \"The Last Few Bricks\". These songs were originally slated to be on the original album, but they were cut because of the album's length. \"The Last Few Bricks\" is an instrumental bridge between \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3\" and \"Goodbye Cruel World\". The song includes themes from previous songs, including \"Young Lust\", \"Empty Spaces\", \"Don't Leave Me Now\", \"What Shall We Do Now?\", and \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\". The purpose of the bridge is to give the bricklayers more time to place the, as the title implies, last few bricks. The album also includes two spoken tracks, \"MC: Atmos\" and \"Master of Ceremonies\".
