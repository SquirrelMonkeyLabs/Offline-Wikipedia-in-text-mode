 "text": "Lorraine Bowen (born 31 October 1961 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and comedian. She has released seven studio and compilation albums. ==Career== Bowen was a member for two bands in the 1980s. The bands were See You in Vegas and The Dinner Ladies. She performed regularly with Billy Bragg on the stage and on record. In 1990, Bragg encouraged Bowen to start a solo career. Bowen started performing solo shows by the name The Lorraine Bowen Experience. Her act had three songs, a Casio keyboard and an ironing board. Her songs are seen as \"quirky\", have humor and are often with a sense of tacky. Themes often include food, movie actors (one of her most popular songs is about Julie Christie), mobile phones and fish fingers. Bowen was a contestant on Britain's Got Talent in May 2015. She sang her own song, \"The Crumble Song\". ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Greatest Hits Volume One (1995) * Greatest Hits Volume Two (1998) * Bossy Nova (2000) * Songs from the Living Room (2002, Italian) * Vital Organs (2006) * Suburban Exotica (2010) * The Crumble Lady (2016) ===Singles=== * Faffing Around on Facebook (2012) * Drinking Song (in German) (2012) * Valentine's Day (in a 21st Century Way) (2013) * Japanese Crumble Song (Sushi Song) (2013) * Bears (2015) * Give My Love to Hull (2015) * Christmas Crumble (2015) * Crumble de Noel (2015) * Reggaeton Crumble Song (2016) ===As a contributing artist=== ;Billy Bragg * The Internationale (1990) * Don't Try This At Home (1991) ;Dope Smugglaz * The Word (1998) ;Fantastic Plastic Machine * There Must Be An Angel (Playing with My Heart) (Mix for Mirror Ball) (1998) * Bossa For Jackie (Dedicated to Mrs Kennedy) (1998) ;The Damned * So, Who's Paranoid?
