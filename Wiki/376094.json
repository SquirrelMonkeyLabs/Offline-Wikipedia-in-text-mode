The words of Hughes' citation explain: > On 16 Aug 09, Staff Sergeant Hughes, a High Threat Improvised Explosive > Device Disposal (IEDD) operator, along with a Royal Engineers Search Team > (REST), was tasked to provide close support to the 2 RIFLES Battlegroup > during an operation to clear a route, south west of Sangin. > > In preparation for the operation, elements of A Company deployed early to > secure an Emergency Helicopter Landing Site and isolate compounds to the > south of the route as part of the inner cordon. > > Whilst conducting these preliminary moves the point section initiated a > Victim Operated IED (VOIED) resulting in a very serious casualty. > > During the casualty recovery that followed, the stretcher-bearers initiated > a second VOIED that resulted in two personnel being killed outright and four > other very serious casualties, one of whom later died from his wounds. > > The area was effectively an IED minefield, over-watched by the enemy and the > section were stranded within it. Hughes and his team were called into this > harrowing and chaotic situation to extract the casualties and recover the > bodies. > > Speed was absolutely essential if further lives were not to be lost. > > Without specialist protective clothing in order to save time, Hughes set > about clearing a path to the injured, providing constant reassurance that > help was on its way. > > On reaching the first badly injured soldier he discovered a further VOIED > within one metre of the casualty that, given their proximity, constituted a > grave and immediate threat to the lives of all the casualties. > > Without knowing the location of the power source, but acutely attuned to the > lethal danger he was facing and the overriding need to get medical attention > to the casualties rapidly, Hughes calmly carried out manual neutralisation > of the device; any error would have proved instantly fatal. > > This was a ‘Category A’ action only conducted in one of two circumstances; a > hostage scenario where explosives have been strapped to an innocent > individual and a mass casualty event where not taking action is certain to > result in further casualties. > > Both place the emphasis on saving other peoples’ lives even, if necessary, > at the expense of the operator. It was an extraordinary act. With shots > keeping the enemy at bay, Hughes coolly turned his attention to reaching the > remaining casualties and retrieving the dead. > > Clearing a path forward he discovered two further VOIEDs and, twice more, > carried out manual neutralisation. His utterly selfless action enabled all > the casualties to be extracted and the bodies recovered. > > Even at this stage Hughes’ task was not finished. The Royal Engineers Search > Team (REST) had detected a further four VOIEDs in the immediate area and > stoically, like he has on over 80 other occasions in the last five months, > he set about disposing of them too. > > Dealing with any form of IED is dangerous; to deal with seven VOIEDs linked > in a single circuit, in a mass casualty scenario, using manual > neutralisation techniques once, never mind three times, is the single most > outstanding act of explosive ordnance disposal ever recorded in Afghanistan. > > That he did it without the security of specialist protective clothing serves > even more to demonstrate his outstanding gallantry. Hughes is unequivocally > deserving of the highest level of public recognition. \"Official citation: > Staff Sergeant Kim Hughes, The Royal Logistic Corps,\" Telegraph (UK). 18 > March 2010; retrieved 2012-12-17. ==References== == Other websites== * George Cross Recipients Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:George Cross holders Category:British military people",
