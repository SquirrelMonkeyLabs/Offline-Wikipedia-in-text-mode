 "text": "Chicken Kiev, sometimes spelled Chicken Kyiv, is a Russian dish. It is made by frying a thin piece of chicken that has been stuffed with butter and covered in breadcrumbs. ==History== Chicken Kiev is named after the city of Kyiv, Ukraine but it was not invented in Ukraine. It was invented by Russian chefs who had gone to France to learn how to cook. The chefs learned a way to prepare breaded veal cutlets, although they started using chicken instead. Chicken Kiev was brought to the United States of America by immigrants, and became a very popular food there. ==Ingredients== Chicken Kiev is made by taking a piece of chicken breast and pounding it flat. The flattened chicken is wrapped around butter and herbs and covered in breadcrumbs before being fried. In France, chefs put garlic inside of it. American and British versions of Chicken Kiev also put garlic and basil inside. Russian versions put cheese inside. Ukrainian chefs include only butter inside and have a special way of preparing it so that the butter does not splash out when it is cut. ==Related pages== * Cordon Bleu ==References== Category:Chicken as food Category:Russian food Category:Ukrainian food",
