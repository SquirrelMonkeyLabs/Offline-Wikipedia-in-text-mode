 "text": "The FN 5.7×28mm is a pistol-sized, armor-piercing bullet made by the Belgian gun company FN Herstal. FN Herstal made the bullet because NATO wanted a pistol-sized round that could replace the 9×19mm Parabellum bullet, since the 9mm cannot shoot through most body armor. However, the FN 5.7×28mm never completely replaced the 9mm because Germany vetoed the decision. It has a similar design to the 5.56x45mm NATO because it is small, but has a lot of stopping power, accuracy, and penetration because of its high velocity. Guns that use the FN 5.7×28mm include the FN P90 and the FN Five-seven. == References == 5.7x28mm 5.7x28mm",
