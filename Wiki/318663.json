 "text": "A take is a performance which is continuously recorded. The word is used in movies and music to track the stages of production. In movie-making, a take means each filmed \"version\" of a shot. Takes of each shot are generally numbered starting with \"take one\" and the number of each take after that is increased (with the director calling for \"take two\", \"take three\", \"take four\", etc.) until the filming of the shot is finished.
