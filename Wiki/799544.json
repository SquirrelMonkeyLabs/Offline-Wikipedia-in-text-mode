 "text": "Gaet'ale pond is a small hypersaline lake found near the Dallol crater in the Danakil Depression (Afar, Ethiopia). It is found over a hot spring. It has no inlet or outlet streams. The water of Gaet'ale Pond has a salinity of 43%, making it the saltiest body of water on Earth. == Location and origin == Gaet'ale pond is the largest of a series of small ponds found approximately 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) southeast of Dallol springs. It is shaped like a crescent. It has a diameter of about 60 metres (200 ft). == Composition == The salts in the water of Gaet'ale Pond are mainly made up of calcium chloride (CaCl2) and magnesium chloride (MgCl2). It also contains small amounts of Na+, K+ and NO2− ions. It also contains traces of Fe3+ that form a complex with Cl−, making the water yellow. Bubbles of odourless gas are released from the lake. It is likely volcanically produced CO2. It has been proposed that the gas may be harmful for small animals or humans because dead birds and insect have been found around the pond. ==References== Category:Bodies of water of Africa Category:Ponds Category:Geography of Ethiopia",
