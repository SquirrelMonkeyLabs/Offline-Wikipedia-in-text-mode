It is located in the south end of Graham Island in the Haida Gwaii group of islands. It is on Skidegate Inlet. The population of Daajing Giids was 964 in 2021. The town was first established 1908 when the first sawmill in the islands began operating. The villagers worked to help supply Allied war planes with lumber during World War II. Within the year, three general stores, a drug and clothing store, two hotels, a pool hall, a boarding house, a barbershop and the local newspaper started operating in the village. The town gained a stable economy from the quick growth in the timber industry during the Great Depression. On May 16, 2022, the village Council had a vote and they decided to change the name of the village Queen Charlotte to the ancestral name of Daajing Giids. It became the first place in British Columbia to change its name back to the ancestral name. == References == ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Settlements in British Columbia",
