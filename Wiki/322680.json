 "text": "Mr. Johnson is a character in Sesame Street. He is Grover's regular customer at Charlie's Restaurant and other restaurants as well. He is a fat Anything Muppet who has become increasingly frustrated over the years with the service Grover provides (however, in the earlier skits, the situation was reversed, Mr. Johnson was calm, but Grover was the one who would get exasperated). Mr. Johnson was mainly performed by Jerry Nelson, and is mostly seen as a customer at Charlie's Restaurant. Mr. Johnson is always called \"Sir\" politely by Grover.
