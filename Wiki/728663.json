 "text": "The term \"Mirasi\" indeed originates from the Arabic word Miras, meaning \"inheritance\" or \"legacy.\" Traditionally, it was applied to those who inherited and continued the same profession across generations, especially when it came to performing arts, storytelling, music, or other oral traditions. In Punjab, Mirasi came to specifically refer to families engaged in singing, dancing, joking, and storytelling. Over time, the term has been used almost as a caste label, but originally, it wasn’t tied to a particular caste or clan. Rather, anyone who maintained the same profession generationally—especially in entertainment and oral history—could be called a Mirasi. This reflects the cultural practice of identifying people by their trade rather than any specific social hierarchy Category:Punjabi people Category:Castes",
