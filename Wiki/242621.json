 "text": "The diamondback rattlesnake is a very poisonous rattlesnake. Diamondbacks are found from Florida to California. The bite from a big rattlesnake can hold enough poison to kill a person. However, if the victim gets to a doctor quickly enough, he or she can usually survive. People who spend time in regions where diamondback rattlesnakes live should take a few precautions. People must be especially careful around caves. Rattlesnakes sometimes hibernate in caves during cool weather. People can listen carefully for its unusual rattling noise, to know where it is hiding. == References == Category:Vipers Category:Snakes of North America",
