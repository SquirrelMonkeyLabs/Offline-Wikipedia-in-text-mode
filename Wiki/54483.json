 "text": "Oriental Orthodoxy is the group of Eastern Christian Churches that accept only the first three ecumenical councils (the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople and the Council of Ephesus) and not the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon. Those Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches. Oriental Orthodox Churches are different from the churches that call themselves \"Eastern Orthodoxy\". The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the spiritual leader of the Oriental Orthodox Churches. That is because the Pope of Alexandria is also Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy See of St. Mark the Apostle.Guirguis M. and van Doorn-Harder N. 2011. The emergence of the modern Coptic papacy: the Egyptian Church and its leadership from the Ottoman period to the present. Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, 2011, pp. 111â€“127. The spiritual leadership is not understood in the same sense as among the Eastern Orthodox Churches to the Church of Constantinople. It is in the spirit of respect and honour for the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria. It does not give any special rights to the Church of Alexandria. == History == The schism (division) between the Great Church Orthodox and Catholic and the Oriental Orthodox Churches happened in the 5th century after the Council of Chalcedon. == Sources == * Betts, Robert B., Christians in the Arab East , Lycabbetus Press (Athens, 1978) * Charles, R.
