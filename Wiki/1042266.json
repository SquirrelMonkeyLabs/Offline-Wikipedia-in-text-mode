 "text": "The 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum was held on Saturday, 14 October 2023. Voters were asked whether or not the Australian Constitution should be changed so that a body called the Indigenous Voice to Parliament can be created and so that Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) are recognised in the Constitution. This is something that has been called for in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which was published in 2017. The referendum was defeated nationally and in all six states (plus the Northern Territory). The Australian Capital Territory was the only state or territory where the referendum passed, while the state with the highest No vote was Queensland. The referendum was held under the federal centrist Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who promised to voters that he would hold a referendum on the issue if elected. Labor won the 2022 federal election and he announced on election night that he would hold a referendum in late 2023.
