 "text": "Sciadopitys, the Japanese umbrella-pine, is a unique conifer. It is endemic to Japan, and the sole surviving member of the family Sciadopityaceae. It is a living fossil with no close relatives: its fossils date from 230 million years ago. It is an evergreen tree that can grow 15-27m tall. It's brown main shoots have whorls of 7–12cm long flexible green \"cladodes\". These look like, and perform the function of, leaves but are actually composed of stem tissue. Occasionally, a cladode will fork and produce a bud in the 'v' of the fork, just like a normal stem. The cones are 6–11 cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the seeds. It is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate and high cost. Koyamaki was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for Prince Hisahito of Akishino, currently third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. The plant was first introduced to Europe by John Gould Veitch in September 1860. Infrared microspectroscopy has identified conifers of the family Sciadopityaceae as the principal source of Baltic amber.Wolfe A.P. et al. 2009.
