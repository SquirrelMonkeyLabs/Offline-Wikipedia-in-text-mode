 "text": "The Batman Family or Bat Family for short is a network of likeminded crimefighters who operate in and around Gotham City, with Batman as its head. They appear in American comic books published by DC Comics. == Description == The group usually are seen interacting with one another and assisting in each other's cases in their respective series. When a new vigilante emerges in the city Batman deduces their identity relatively quickly. Although some members occasionally resent Batman’s intrusion into their lives, all respect him as a legend within the superhero community and rarely challenge his authority. Most of the members also have a strong rapport with the Dark Knight due to their long and close relationships with him over the years, and consider him a close friend as well as ally. In a 2002 storyline in which Bruce Wayne, Batman’s secret identity, is accused of murder, Batman's friends gather to prove his innocence. It has also been implied through Batman's history that this network serves as a surrogate family for Batman and keeps him from slipping too far into his ruthless vigilante persona. == Members == === Golden Age / (Earth- Two) === * Alfred Beagle * Richard \"Dick\" Grayson / Robin * Bette Kane / Batgirl * Helena Wayne / Huntress * Katherine \"Kathy\" Kane / Batwoman (deceased) * Selina Kyle-Wayne / Catwoman (deceased) * Bruce Wayne / Batman (deceased) === Silver and Bronze Ages / (Earth-One) === The Silver Age of comics saw the first real establishment of the Bat-Family. * Bruce Wayne / Batman (leader) * Barbara Gordon / Batgirl * Richard \"Dick\" Grayson / Robin / Nightwing * Alfred Pennyworth / The Outsider * Jason Todd / Robin * Bette Kane / Batgirl (retired) * Katherine \"Kathy\" Kane / Batwoman (deceased) * Ace the Bat-Hound (retired) * Bat-Mite (expelled) === Post-Crisis / (New Earth) === Following Crisis on Infinite Earths, many members of the Bat-Family were progressively phased out.
