It is a strong oxidizer. ==Preparation== Oxygen difluoride was first prepared in 1929. It was made by the electrolysis of molten potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid. The chemicals had a small amount of moisture. Paul Lebeau; Damiens, A. \"A New Method for the Preparation of the Fluorine Oxide”Compt. rend. 1929, volume 188, 1253-5.Lebeau, P.; Damiens, A. \"The Existence of an Oxygen Compound of Fluorine\"Compt. rend. 1927, volume 185, pages 652-4. Nowadays, it is prepared by the reaction of fluorine with a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Sodium fluoride is left as a side-product: :2 F2 \\+ 2 NaOH → OF2 \\+ 2 NaF + H2O ==Reactions== It is a very powerful oxidizing agent. This is proved by the oxidation number of +2 for the oxygen atom. This oxidising number is quite unusual. Above 200 °C, OF2 decomposes to oxygen and fluorine. OF2 reacts with many metals. It produces oxides and fluorides. Nonmetals also react with it. Phosphorus reacts with OF2 to form PF5 and POF3. Sulfur produces SO2 and SF4 with it. A noble gas, xenon also reacts with it. It produces XeF4 and xenon oxyfluorides. Oxygen difluoride reacts very slowly with water to form hydrofluoric acid: :OF2 (aq) + H2O (aq) → 2 HF (aq) + O2 (g) Oxygen difluoride oxidizes sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide: :OF2 \\+ SO2 → SO3 \\+ F2 However, in the presence of UV radiation the products are sulfuryl fluoride, , and pyrosulfuryl fluoride, : :OF2 \\+ 2 SO2 → ==Safety== OF2 is a dangerous chemical. This is because it is highly oxidising. ==References== ==Other websites== * National Pollutant Inventory - Fluoride and compounds fact sheet * WebBook page for OF2 Category:Fluorine compounds Category:Oxygen compounds",
