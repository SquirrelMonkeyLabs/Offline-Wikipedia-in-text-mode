 "text": "A Sacca (Italian for Sack or Bag) is an inlet, bay, or cove along a canal. It is usually in the context of the Venetian Lagoon; the word Sacca is used when talking about bays, inlets, and coves in canals in the Venetian Lagoon. An example is the Sacca della Misericordia, in the district of Cannaregio in Venice. It is now used as a dock for boat storage. These coves have been often used as deposits of gunk coming from canal excavation and crushed-up building material. This has formed artificial islands. Examples of this are Sacca Sessola, Sacca Fisola, and Sacca San Biagio. Category:Venice Category:Bays",
