 "text": "The WAGR Ut class was a single side tank steam locomotive operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1957 to 1970. The Ut class was the result of converting standard U class No. 664 from a tender engine into a side tank engine for suburban service. Despite being converted to coal before becoming a tank engine in 1954, however, when being rebuilt it returned to oil burning, which was stored in the bunker. No. 664 was withdrawn in 1970 being one of the last tank engines in service, it is now displayed at the Bassendean Railway Museum. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
