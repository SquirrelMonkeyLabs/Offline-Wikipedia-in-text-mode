 "text": "Taruga fastigo is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists saw it for the first time in Morningside Estate, near Sinharaja Forest Reserve, 1060 m above sea level. ==Body== The adult male frog is 35.3 to 39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 54.8 to 63.9 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown or dark green in color. There is a mark on the frog's back that looks like an hourglass. There are bumps on the edges of the hourglass and near the rear end. ==Name== Scientists named this frog fastigo because of its pointed nose. ==Home== This frog lives in trees. It only lives in tropical forests on mountains. People have seen this frog between 1060 and 1300 meters above sea level. People have seen adult frogs in trees as high as two meters above the ground, not far from water that does not flow. This frog lays eggs in pools of water that does not flow or move. ==Danger== There are fewer of these frogs than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Human beings cut forests to get wood to build with and build farms, for example cardamom and tea farms. Sometimes people build small farms to grow potatoes. The chemicals meant to kill pests can also kill this frog. Climate change might also hurt this frog because it helps frogs from lower down in the hills live higher up in the hills with Taruga fastigo. The frogs from lower in the hills eat the same food that Taruga fastigo would eat. At least two of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Morningside Forest Reserve and Baragala Forest Reserve. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
