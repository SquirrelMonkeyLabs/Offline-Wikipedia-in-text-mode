 "text": "Hyla palliata is a nomina inquirenda. That means it is a name that scientists could give to a species, but it is not the name of any real species right now. In the 1860s, Edward Drinker Cope and his team of scientists found a frog in Paraguay. They decided to name it Hyla palliata. They killed one frog and brought it away with them as a sample, but then someone lost it. Later, other scientists disagreed about whether any species should be called Hyla palliata. In 2006, Brusquetti and Lavilla wrote that the name Hyla palliata might be a good name for some of the frogs in Boana. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
