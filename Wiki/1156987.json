Scientists saw the frog between 400 and 1500 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. They think that human beings change the places where it lives to make farms and get wood to build with, but they are not sure. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
