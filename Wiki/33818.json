 "text": "\"Aegukka\" (; say: ), officially translated as \"Patriotic Song\", is the national anthem of North Korea. To celebrate the country's independence from Japan, it was written by Pak Se-yong and composed by Kim Won-gyun, then it was adopted in 1947 shortly after. It should not be confused with South Korea's national anthem, which has the same name but uses a different romanisation scheme. It is sometimes also known by the first bit of the song, \"Achhimŭn pinnara\" (), meaning \"Let Morning Shine\". ==Lyrics== Korean originalNational Anthems & Patriotic Songs \"North Korean National Anthem - Aegukka (애국가)\" lyrics Romanization IPA transcriptionBased on Wiktionary's Korean pronunciation.
