 "text": "Chandrayaan-1 was India's first spacecraft launched to explore the Moon. It lifted off on 22 October 2008. It was under the control of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was launched by a PSLV rocket. Chandrayaan 1 carried NASA's M1 Moon Mineralogy Mapper. The space mission was designed to last for two years. In reality the mission lasted for 312 days. It mapped about 95% of the moon's surface. On 29 August 2009 radio signals from Chandrayaan-I were lost. The mission was considered ended at that point. The lunar probe showed the presence of water on moon. == Goals == The mission had the following stated objectives, or goals: * to design, develop, launch and orbit a spacecraft around the Moon using an Indian-made rocket * to conduct scientific experiments using instruments on the spacecraft: ** to make a three-dimensional map of both the near and far sides of the Moon ** for chemical and mineralogical mapping of the entire lunar surface at high spatial resolution, mapping particularly the chemical elements magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron, titanium, radon, uranium, and thorium * to increase scientific knowledge * to test the impact of a sub-satellite (Moon Impact Probe â€“ MIP) on the surface of the Moon to help prepare for future soft- landing missions == References == Category:Spacecrafts launched in 2000s Category:2008 in India Category:2009 in Asia Category:Indian Space Research Organisation",
