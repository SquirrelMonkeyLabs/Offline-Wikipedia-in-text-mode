 "text": "In Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre, Nazi Germany killed around 15,000 people by \"euthanasia\" in 1940 and 1941. Most of these victims had psychiatric or intellectual disabilities. The Nazis' ideas about eugenics said that people with disabilities were \"life unworthy of life\" - meaning they did not deserve to live. Sonnenstein was one of six killing centres set up by the Nazis for Aktion T4, their secret \"euthanasia\" program. Their goal was to get rid of all of Germany's people with disabilities. The killing center was located in the former fortress of Sonnenstein Castle near Pirna in eastern Germany. A hospital was established there in 1811. In 1940 and 1941, more than 14,000 people were killed there. They also talked about the removal of ballast existences in their propaganda. The term Ballastexistenz had been introduced in the 1920s. ==References== == Other websites == * \"National Socialist crimes in Pirna\" Pirna-Sonnenstein Memorial. Saxon Memorial Foundation.
