 "text": "The Kokoda big-eyed tree frog (Nyctimystes semipalmatus) is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it in the Owen Stanley Mountains between Garaina and Mount Dayman, at 300 to 700 meters above sea level. It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean. Scientists looked at preserved, dead frogs. Among these, the largest adult male frog was 8.4 cm long from nose to rear end but most were closer to 6.4 cm long. The females were about 5.9 to 8.0 cm long. The dead frogs were gray and brown, but the preservative may have changed their color. Scientists who wrote about this preserved frog years ago said it looked pink. One female frog laid 400 eggs at one time. They were 2.6 mm in diameter. They were cream-colored. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
