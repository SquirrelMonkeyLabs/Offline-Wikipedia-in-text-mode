 "text": "Jane the Virgin is an American romantic dramedy and satirical telenovela developed by Jennie Snyder Urman. The series premiered on October 13, 2014 on The CW. It is a loose adaptation of the Venezuelan telenovela Juana la Virgen created by Perla Farías. The series stars Gina Rodriguez as Jane Villanueva, a devout 23-year-old Latina virgin, who becomes pregnant after an accidental artificial insemination by her gynecologist. The program parodies commonly used tropes and devices in Latin telenovelas. At the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, Jane the Virgin was nominated for the award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, received the Peabody Award, and Gina Rodriguez won the award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. It was also selected as one of the top 10 Television Programs of 2014 by the American Film Institute. Beginning with the fourth episode of season three, the series' on- screen title card was modified, with \"The Virgin\" crossed out in favor of a substitution corresponding to each episode. This mirrored the storyline, in which Jane is no longer a virgin.\"'Jane the Virgin': See the CW Comedy's Updated Title\" from The Hollywood Reporter (November 2, 2016) On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a fifth and final season, which premiered on March 27, 2019. ==References== Category:American telenovelas Category:2014 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings",
