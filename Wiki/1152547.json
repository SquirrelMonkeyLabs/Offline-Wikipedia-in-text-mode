 "text": "King Dinosaur is a science fiction movie about dinosaurs. == Plot == Five years in the future, four scientists are selected as astronauts to travel to an uncharted planet called Nova that has just entered Earth's solar system. After first discovering normal animals, such as a kinkajou, crows, and an alligator (a prehistoric species called Diplocynodon), they soon encounter and battle giant insects, an enormous Gigantophis garstini, and prehistoric mammals, such as a cave bear, an American mastodon, and a Doedicurus. Richard and Nora paddle a raft out to a local island and are trapped in a cave by various creatures from the past, such as a semi-quadrupedal Tyrannosaurus. They fire off a signal flare. Back on the mainland near their spaceship, Ralph and Patricia see the distress signal, grab the nuclear power supply and paddle their raft out to the island to rescue Richard and Nora. Before they go back to their own time, they set the power supply in 30 minutes and finally leave it on the island. After encountering more prehistoric creatures from the past, they reach their spaceship. The power supply blows up the island in a nuclear mushroom cloud, rendering the Tyrannosaurus extinct, along with all the other creatures the humans encountered. == Creatures that appear == * Kinkajou * Crow (identified as a vulture) * Diplocynodon (identified as an alligator) * Giant insects * Gigantophis garstini (identified as Gigantophis) * Cave bear * American mastodon (identified as a mastodon) * Tyrannosaurus * Doedicurus (identified as a glyptodont) Category:Movies about dinosaurs",
