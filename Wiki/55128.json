 "text": "The Council of Jerusalem or apostolic council is a common name for a meeting of early Christian leaders reported in the Acts of the Apostles chapter . The meeting must have happened about the year 50, at the latest some time before the death of James the Just in 62. == The issues == A common interpretation is that the council came together because there was disagreement within the Early Christian community between those who believed the church must observe the rules of traditional Judaism,That were the followers of the Pillars of the Church, led by James; see Galatians 2:12 and Paul of Tarsus, who believed there was no such necessity. The \"rules of traditional Judaism,\" the Halakha of Rabbinic Judaism, were not finished at this time.The Jewish Encyclopedia article on Jesus notes: \"Jesus, however, does not appear to have taken into account the fact that the Halakah was at this period just becoming crystallized, and that much variation existed as to its definite form; the disputes of the Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai were occurring about the time of his maturity.\" The central issue was circumcision, as the author of Acts relates the initial confrontation in Antioch, where Paul had been preaching: :\"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.\" (Acts 15:1) KJV == Footnotes == == Other websites == * Acts 15 * JersualemCouncil.org * NA26 Greek Acts 15 * Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers * Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostolic Canons * Didache * Apostolic Constitutions * Didascalia Apostolorum * Jewish Antiquities 20 * New Perspective on Paul * Early Christian Writings * Jewish Encyclopedia: Hillel v.
