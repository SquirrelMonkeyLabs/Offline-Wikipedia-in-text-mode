 "text": "A coronation is a ceremony that gives a monarch regal or royal power or recognizes that power. The power is symbolized by putting a crown on his or her head. We say that the monarch is \"crowned\" at the coronation. The ritual with anointing may have a religious meaning. Coronations are not as common now as in the past, although in some countries such as Great Britain it is still normal to hold the ceremony to install a new king or queen. == Related pages == * Enthronement * Inauguration ==Other websites== Category:Monarchy",
