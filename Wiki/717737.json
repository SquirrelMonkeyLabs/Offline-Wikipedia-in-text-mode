The English translation was made by Eddie Rivera and Eddie Woods in 1931. The song was a bolero, written in 1929 and recorded in Cuba the same year. The English version of the song, written in 1931, became a major hit ten years later when recorded by the Jimmy Dorsey orchestra. On 78 rpm records, Green eyes was backed by Maria Elena, which was also a hit.The record first reached the Billboard charts on May 9, 1941 and lasted 21 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1.
