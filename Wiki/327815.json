In a 400-year cycle in the Gregorian Calendar, 43 or 10.75% of all years are common years starting on Wednesday. Like all common years, they occur in a pattern of 6-11-11 years (e.g. 1997, 2003, 2014, 2025). However, this pattern gets broken when there is a century year that is not a leap year. Over the past 400-year cycle (from 1600 to 2000), there was a 12-year gap between 1698 and 1710, 6-year gaps between 1794, 1800 and 1806, and another 12-year gap between 1890 and 1902.
