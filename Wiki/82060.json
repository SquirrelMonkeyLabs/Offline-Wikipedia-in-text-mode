Confirmed as Uranus XVIII it was named after the sorcerer Prospero in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Sycorax and Setebos to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.

Preprint However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The moon appears grey in the visible light Tommy Grav, Matthew J. Holman, and Wesley C.
