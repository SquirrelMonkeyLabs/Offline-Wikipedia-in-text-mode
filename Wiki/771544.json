 "text": "Burslem is one of the towns that is part of the city of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. The 2011 census revealed the ward had a population of 11,314 people. Hanley, Tunstall, Fenton, Longton and Stoke-upon-Trent are the other towns that make up the city. It is a very old town. The Domesday Book shows Burslem (then known as Bacardeslim) as a small farming hamlet. Even as far back as the late 12th century, there was a pottery industry in the town. The Trent & Mersey Canal flows through the west and south of the town centre. It was used as the main way pottery was moved from the factories. Heavy goods are most economically transported by water. The football club Port Vale F.C. is based in the town. It plays home games at Vale Park. Professional darts player Phil Taylor is from Burslem. ==Gallery== File:Burslem_- _Wedgwood_Institute_(Geograph-2410804-by-Dave-Bevis).jpg|Wedgwood Institute File:%27Back_to_back%27_housing_in_Burslem_-_geograph.org.uk_-_7355.jpg|Back- to-back housing in Burslem File:The_Queens_Theatre,_Burslem.jpg|The Queens Theatre File:Vale_Park.jpg|Vale Park == References == Category:Towns in Staffordshire Category:Stoke-on-Trent Category:11th-century establishments in England",
