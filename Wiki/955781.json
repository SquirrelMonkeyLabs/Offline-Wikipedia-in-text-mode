 "text": "Phyllodytes megatympanum is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 90 and 95 meters above sea level. The skin of the frog's back and legs is light brown. The place where the legs meet the body is yellow. This frog's eardrum is very large. The eardrum is called a tympanum. This frog lives on bromeliad plants that grow on tree branches. In some parts of Brazil, it also lives in shrubby places. The male frog sits 2 to 10 meters above the ground and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on the leaves. When they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water in the bromeliad plants and then swims and grows in the water. This frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large area. Although human beings cut down much of the forest where it used to live to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, there is still a large forest space left. Also, human beings have started to grow trees as crops, which is a little better for frogs. Scientists think the frog could be in danger if humans go into their forests to take away the bromeliad plants, but they do not think anyone is actually doing that right now. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
