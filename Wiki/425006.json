 "text": "During World War II, Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany. The Norwegian Resistance rebelled against the invasion and occupation by the Nazis. It lasted from 1940 to 1945. It supported the Norwegian government-in-exile that was formed outside of the country as the true government of Norway. They discouraged Norwegians from following the pro-Nazi Norwegian government formed by Vidkun Quisling. The Norwegian Resistance helped the original members of the Norwegian government to escape from Norway. They were lucky that they escaped alive, because the Germans tried to kill them. They managed to get to the coast where a British warship picked them up. The Norwegian Resistance also carried out armed resistance against the Nazi soldiers. This included sabotage (breaking or destroying things), assassinations, and exploding German ships with bombs. The Norwegian Resistance also did unarmed civil disobedience actions, like protests.
