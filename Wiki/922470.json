 "text": "The First Italo-Ethiopian War was a conflict between the Ethiopian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy during the Scramble for Africa from 1895 to 1896, initiated by the disputed Treaty of Wuchale where the Italians tried to convert Ethiopia into an Italian Protectorate. The Italians would invade Ethiopia from Eritrea until they would be besieged by the Ethiopian forces in the Fort of Mek'ele, finally the Italians would sign the Treaty of Addis Ababa where the conflict would end where the sovereignty of Ethiopia would be recognized, this would bring years later the consequence of the Second Italo- Ethiopian War, which occurred between 1935 and 1936.Professor Kinfe Abraham, \"The Impact of the Adowa Victory on The Pan-African and Pan-Black Anti- Colonial Struggle,\" Address delivered to The Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University, 8 February 2006 == References == == Other websites == * * * * Category:1895 Category:1896 Category:19th century in Africa Category:Colonialism Category:History of Ethiopia Category:Wars involving Africa Category:Wars involving Italy Category:19th-century conflicts",
