 "text": "A sphere is a round, three-dimensional shape. All points on the edge of the sphere are at the same distance from the center. The distance from the center is called the radius of the sphere. A real-world sphere is called a globe if it is large (such as the Earth), and as a ball if it is small, like an association football. Common things that have the shape of a sphere are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls. The Earth and the Sun are nearly spherical, meaning sphere-shaped. A sphere is the three-dimensional analog of a circle. == Calculating measures of a sphere == === Surface area === Using the circumference: A=\\frac{c^2}{\\pi}=\\frac{2c^2}{\\tau} Using the diameter: A=\\pi d^2=\\frac{\\tau d^2}{2} Using the radius: A=2\\tau r^2=4\\pi r^2 Using the volume: A=\\sqrt[3]{3\\tau V^2}=\\sqrt[3]{6\\pi V^2} === Circumference === Using the surface area: c=\\sqrt{\\pi A}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau A}{2}} Using the diameter: c=\\pi d=\\frac{\\tau d}{2} Using the radius: c=\\tau r=2\\pi r Using the volume: c=\\sqrt[3]{6\\pi^2 V}=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3\\tau^2 V}{2}} === Diameter === Using the surface area: d=\\sqrt{\\frac A\\pi}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2A}{\\tau}} Using the circumference: d=\\frac c\\pi=\\frac{2c}{\\tau} Using the radius: d=2r Using the volume: d=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{6V}{\\pi}}=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{12V}{\\tau}} === Radius === Using the surface area: r=\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\tau}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{4\\pi}} Using the circumference: r=\\frac c\\tau=\\frac{c}{2\\pi} Using the diameter: r=\\frac d2 Using the volume: r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3V}{2\\tau}}=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3V}{4\\pi}} === Volume === Using the surface area: V=\\sqrt{\\frac{A^3}{18\\tau}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{A^3}{36\\pi}} Using the circumference: V=\\frac{c^3}{6\\pi^2}=\\frac{2c^3}{3\\tau^2} Using the diameter: V=\\frac{\\pi d^3}{6}=\\frac{\\tau d^3}{12} Using the radius: V=\\frac{2\\tau r^3}{3}=\\frac{4\\pi r^3}{3} == Equation of a sphere == In Cartesian coordinates, the equation for a sphere with a center at (x_0,y_0,z_0) is as follows: :(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2+(z-z_0)^2=r^2 where r is the radius of the sphere. == Related pages == * Circle * Pi * Tau Category:Three-dimensional shapes",
