They threw boomerangs at the explorers, and then set fire to grass. Stuart says in his journal that he and his men fired their guns at the Warumungu, but he does not mention if any were wounded or killed. The site of the battle has been called Attack Creek. Stuart was forced to return to Adelaide. The Northern Territory government has built a roadside memorial park near the site on the Stuart Highway. ==References== Category:Australian Aboriginal groups",
