 "text": "Số đề is an illegal gambling game in Vietnam based on lottery results. The game uses the last two digits of the lottery prizes from Vietnam's 27 official government lottery draws, with the special prize called \"đề\" and the other prizes called \"lô\". There are various ways to play, such as betting on the combination of \"lô\" and \"đề\", betting on the first and last digits, or betting on consecutive numbers, depending on the period. The players of \"số đề\" are typically rich people, who hire others to select the numbers for them. The number selectors can be poor, unemployed, ticket sellers, or street vendors. In Hanoi, there is a developed system of \"số đề\" agents that operates in connection with lottery retailers and tea shops, and their activities are quite open. Some players have even switched to playing \"số đề\" through the Internet. The game \"số đề\" has negative consequences. The majority of players suffer losses, but due to greed and desire for revenge, they continue playing without stopping. As a result, their mental well-being is haunted by numbers, their health deteriorates, they experience strained family relationships and social reputation, and many end up in debt and live in secrecy. ==References== Category:Gambling Category:Vietnamese culture",
