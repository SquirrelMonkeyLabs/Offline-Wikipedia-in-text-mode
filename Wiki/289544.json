 "text": "A sundae is an ice cream dessert. It is usually made of a scoop of ice cream topped with sauce or syrup. Sometimes, it has other toppings including chopped nuts, sprinkles, whipped cream, or maraschino cherries. The first historically documented sundae was created on Sunday, April 3, 1892. Sundaes are found and available to buy in many places, including fast foods, restaurants, and other luxury places. Sundaes are usually sweeter than ice cream and the scoops of ice cream and flavors can be customized. ==Other websites== * Wisconsin Historical Society ice cream marker * Historical documents supporting Ithaca as the birthplace of the sundae sundae Category:American food",
