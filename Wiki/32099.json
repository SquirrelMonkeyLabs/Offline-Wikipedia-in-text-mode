 "text": "Cargo or freight means goods which people transport, often using a vehicle made for that purpose rather than for passenger service. The vehicle is usually a truck or freighter or cargo aircraft or freight train. Prefabricated cargo is a type of cargo for transportation in prefabricated batches, which are completed at the expense of piece units and container volumes. The noun is used as not countable; people will talk about some freight. Today, goods other than bulk cargo are usually packed in shipping containers, which are carried. A place which loads or unloads cargo is usually called a cargo terminal. == Related pages == * Cargo plane * Cargo ship == References == == Other websites == * The Gallery of Transport Loss -- Photos & Lessons of Disaster Category:Transport",
