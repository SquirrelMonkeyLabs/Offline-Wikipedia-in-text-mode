 "text": "Bai Virbaijee Soparivala Parsi High School (BVS) is a private school and religious Parsi building in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. It opened in 1859 as Karachi Parsi Balak Shalla, by the Zoroastrian residents of Karachi. BVS was designed by Moses Somake, the Jewish architect who is perhaps the first known architect of many Karachi buildings in the then emerging city. This Parsi place of worship can be considered as the only \"National Parsi Fire Temple of Pakistan\", within the country, and a potential for Marathi Indian and all Parsi Iranian Yatris respectively. == Modern history == * In 1947, after the partition of India, on the personal request to the elders of the Parsi community by the Quaid-I-Azam, Mr. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the school opened its doors to all Muslim and other non Parsi children of the new nation. * On 23 May 1958, the school began Centenary celebrations and the entire Parsi community participated in the functions that were organized.
