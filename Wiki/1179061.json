 "text": "A chapel of ease (or chapel-of-ease) is a church building other than the parish church, built within the bounds of a parish for the attendance of those who cannot reach the parish church conveniently, generally due to travel distance. Often a chapel of ease is deliberately built as such, being more accessible to some parishioners than the main church. Such a chapel may exist, for example, when a parish covers several dispersed villages, or a central village together with its satellite hamlet or hamlets. In such a case the parish church will be in the main settlement, with one or more chapels of ease in the subordinate village(s) and/or hamlet(s). When two or more existing parishes are combined into a single parish, one or more of the old church buildings may be kept as a chapel of ease. == Gallery == All Saints, Buncton.jpg |All Saints' Church in West Sussex dates from the 11th or 12th century.
