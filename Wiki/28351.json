The Bushman, Xixo, decides to return the bottle to the \"end of the earth\", to finish all the evil his family has gone through. Along the way, he meets a group of terrorists on the run, as well as a clumsy scientist who falls in love with a former newspaper journalist. During his journey, Xixo encounters modern civilisation for the first time. == Other websites == * Category:1980 action movies Category:1980 comedy movies Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:South African action movies Category:South African comedy movies Category:Botswanan movies Category:Multilingual movies Category:Movies set in Africa Category:Movies set in deserts Category:Movies directed by Jamie Uys",
