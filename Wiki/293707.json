It is located in the Borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme, near to the borders with Shropshire and Cheshire. In 2011, the town had a population of 75,082 people. The \"Newcastle\" part of the town's name comes from the town being the location of a new castle in the 12th century. The \"Lyme\" part of the name could refer to the Lyme Brook, a stream of the River Trent, or the Forest of Lyme that covered the area with lime trees in the Middle Ages. The town is home to Newcastle-under-Lyme School, an independent school. The school was established in the 17th century. In the 18th century, Newcastle was an important coaching town, located on the main road from Liverpool and Manchester to Birmingham and London. In 2023, Newcastle-under-Lyme celebrated 850 years since its first Royal Charter which was granted in 1173. ==Gallery== File:Queens_gardens_newcastle_under_lyme.jpg|Queen's Gardens File:Newcastle-under-Lyme_Museum_&_Art_Gallery_(1).jpg|Newcastle-under-Lyme Museum and Art Gallery File:St_Giles'_Church_Street_Newcastle-under-Lyme_- _geograph.org.uk_-_558236.jpg|St Giles' Church File:Liverpool_Road,_Newcastle- Under-Lyme_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2101373.jpg|Liverpool Road ==References== Category:Towns in Staffordshire Category:Market towns in England",
