 "text": "Planomicrobium koreense is a species of bacteria. It was first found by Jung- Hoon Yoon in Jeotgal, a salted fermented food made in Korean. Jung-Hoon Yoon found in Jeotgal also other new bacteria like Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus and Jeotgalicoccus halotolerans. The cells are rods. Sometimes they can be first coccoid but after some time they change to rods. Planomicrobium koreense is gram-positive. Sometimes the older cells change to gram negative. They have a single polar flagellum. == References == ==Other websites== *Euz√©by: List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) *Planomicrobium koreense at Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) Category:Gram-positive bacteria",
