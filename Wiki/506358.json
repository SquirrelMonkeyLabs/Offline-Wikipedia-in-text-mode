 "text": "Nathan Hale (June 6, 1755 â€“ September 22, 1776) was a soldier in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He volunteered for a spying mission in New York City, but was captured by the British and executed. He is probably best remembered for possibly saying before being hanged: \"I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country.\" Hale has long been considered an American hero. In 1985, he was officially designated the state hero of Connecticut. ==References== Category:Executed American people Category:People executed by hanging Category:Military people from Connecticut Category:1755 births Category:1776 deaths",
