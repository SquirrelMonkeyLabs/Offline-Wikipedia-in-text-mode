 "text": "The Texas Rangers are an American Major League Baseball team from Arlington, Texas. The team plays in Arlington, but it also represents the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth and the surrounding area. The Rangers are part of the Western Division of Major League Baseball's American League. Their first home field in Texas was Arlington Stadium. They built Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, later known as Globe Life Park in Arlington, next door, and tore down Arlington Stadium when they moved in to the new stadium. After the 2019 season, they left Globe Life Park for the new Globe Life Field, located across the street. Globe Life Park was then rebuilt into a football and soccer stadium. The team began in 1961 as the Washington Senators. The Senators played poorly and had too few fans to support them. The team moved to Arlington, Texas, in 1972. They were renamed in honor of the famous state police force called the Texas Rangers. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had also been a minor league baseball team called the Dallas Rangers. == Postseason == On October 22, 2010, the Rangers won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) for the first time. They beat the then-defending champion New York Yankees four games to two in the series. This was their first trip to the World Series, but they lost the San Francisco Giants in five games. In 2011, the Rangers again reached the World Series, and again lost, this time to the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2023, the Rangers won the World Series, beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-1, winning the first, third, fourth, and fifth game. == Other websites == *Texas Rangers official website *Texas Rangers team statistics == References == Category:1961 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Washington, D.C.
