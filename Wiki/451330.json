An official seal was provided for in the Constitution of the State of Tennessee of February 6, 1796. The design wasn't started until September 25, 1801. The outer ring has the words \"The Great Seal of the State of Tennessee\" and the date \"Feb. 6th, 1796\". The month and day were left out of later designs so only \"1796\" is shown.
