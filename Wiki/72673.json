 "text": "In molecular biology, two nucleotides on opposite complementary DNA strands that are connected by hydrogen bonds are called a base pair (often abbreviated bp). In DNA pairing, adenine (A) forms a base pair with thymine (T), to form an A/T base pair. Guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C) in DNA, to form a G/C base pair. == Related pages == * DNA * Nucleobase Category:Molecular biology",
