 "text": "The Art of Skiing is a Goofy cartoon made by Walt Disney Productions in 1941. It has historical significance as the first cartoon to use the now-famous Goofy holler,. (January 2009) IMDb.com. Accessed January 5, 2009. as well as the short that led to the \"How to...\" series, beginning with How to Play Baseball (1942) and continuing through How to Hook Up Your Home Theater (2007). ==Notes== Goofy goes to Sugar Bowl Ski Resort, to learn how to ski. The name of the resort can be seen in the opening frames of the cartoon. Sugar Bowl Ski Resort was used because Walt Disney had an interest in the Sugar Bowl ski area, to the extent that one of the peaks at Sugar Bowl is named Mt. Disney after him. The narrator and the opening titles mention an alternate (and \"correct\") pronunciation of skiing as shee-ing, despite the narrator mostly pronouncing it vice versa throughout the short. Another Goofy cartoon featured Goofy himself mentioning this to an Ancient Greek. This was the first cartoon to use the signature Goofy holler; it is the only vocal uttered by Goofy in the short. ==Voice cast== * Goofy: Danny Webb * Narrator: John McLeish * Yodeler: Hannes Schroll ==Releases== *1941 - theatrical release *1956 - Disneyland, episode #2.24: \"The Goofy Sports Story\" (TV) *1972 - The Mouse Factory, episode #17: \"Sports\" (TV) *1976 - \"Superstar Goofy\" (TV) *c. 1983 - Good Morning, Mickey!, episode #80 (TV) *1983 - \"A Disney Channel Christmas\" (TV) *c. 1992 - Mickey's Mouse Tracks, episode #36 (TV) *c. 1997 - The Ink and Paint Club, episode #3: \"Sports Goofy\" (TV) *2010 - Have a Laugh!, episode #6 (TV) *2010 - Mickey's Christmas Special (TV) ==Home media== The short was released on December 2, 2002, on Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy.
