 "text": "In chemistry, an electrophile is a molecule or an atom that is happy to take electrons from another one. Many electrophiles have a positive charge. They are also called Lewis acids. Some examples of electrophiles are molecules where the atoms have a big difference in electronegativity, like HCl or a carbonyl, or also oxidizing agents. Electrophiles get attacked by a nucleophile, which is the opposite kind of molecule. This happens for example in addition reactions. == Organic Chemistry == === Addition of halogens === C2H4 \\+ Br2 â†’ BrCH2CH2Br == References == Category:Organic chemistry",
