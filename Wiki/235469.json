 "text": "The Boston Police Strike happened in Massachusetts during 1919. Over a thousand police officers went on strike. They wanted to be paid more money. The Governor of Massachusetts, Calvin Coolidge, said it was wrong to \"strike against the public safety\". Coolidge fired the police officers who went on strike. He hired veterans from World War I to replace them and gave them same bonuses that the striking policemen asked for to the veterans. This was the event which made Coolidge popular enough to become Vice President of the United States and then President of the United States of America after the death of Harding.
