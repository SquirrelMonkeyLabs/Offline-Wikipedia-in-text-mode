 "text": "Kanuites is an extinct genus of viverrid carnivore. It lived in Africa, during the Miocene epoch. The viverrids are a group of civet cats, and the group is rather cat-like in its form and life-style. ==Description== Kanuites was about long, and looked very similar to modern genets. It was probably an omnivore and may have had retractable claws, like a feline. It may have lived in trees for part of its life. ==References== Category:Viverrids Category:Miocene Category:Mammals of Africa",
