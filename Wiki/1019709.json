 "text": "The limestone small tree frog (Liuixalus calcarius) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam in Hai Phong Province. This frog lives in tropical forest that has not been cut down. ==Body== The skin of the frog's back is red-brown in color with an X-shaped mark on the shoulder. This frog has disks on its toes for climbing. The pupil of the eye goes side to side and opens up and down. ==Name== Scientists named this frog calcarius for the Latin language word for \"limestone.\" The frog lives where there is limestone karst rock. ==Home== People have seen this frog between 15 and 45 meters above sea level on Cat Ba Island. Scientists think it probably lives in many more places too. The frog lives near pools of water in the karst rock and in small lakes that dry up for part of the year. Cat Ba Island is in Cat Ba National Park. ==Young== Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole because that is what other frogs in this genus do. Scientists have heard male frogs calling in April. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. They think it needs forests to live, and human beings cut down forests to make farms and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
