This slogan played a major role in intensifying the movement, and later became the main slogan of the movement. Dipu Moni, Junaid Ahmed Palak and many political persons and organizations claimed that giving the slogan shows deep disrespect to the spirit of the liberation war and the history of Bangladesh. Sheikh Hasina later said that she did not address the students. A lot of literature and music was later written around this slogan and there was much discussion and criticism about the interpretation of this slogan. The students participating in the 15 September 2024 movement recalled the day in the Dhaka University campus with this slogan. ==References== Category:2024 protests Category:Politics of Bangladesh",
