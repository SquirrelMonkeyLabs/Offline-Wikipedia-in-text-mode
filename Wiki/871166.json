 "text": "In group theory, a branch of mathematics, given a group G under a binary operation, a subset H of G is called a subgroup of G if the elements H also forms a group under the binary operation. The situation could arise in which the subset H does not comply with the binary operation. In that case, H would not be a subgroup. For example, the even numbers are a subgroup of the integers, with addition as the binary operation. Category:Group theory",
