 "text": "The Sydney Harbour Bridge, in Sydney Harbour, is a bridge that joins north Sydney with south Sydney. People can cross the bridge by car, bicycle, walking or by public transport. It now carries eight traffic lanes. Using six intended traffic lanes and an additional two going south that used to be tram tracks. There are two railway lanes that head in opposite directions. There is a tunnel that goes underneath. The bridge is an important tourist attraction. The scenery attracts many tourists and people living in or near the city. One of the many attractions of the Harbour Bridge is its famous 'BridgeClimb'. Luna Park Sydney is located next to the bridge. The bridge is long and wide. The highest point of the arch is tall. Building began on 19 March 1923 and ended in 1932. John Bradfield led the bridge's building. The standards of industrial safety during construction were poor by today's standards. Sixteen workers died during construction,[31] but surprisingly only two were from falling off the bridge. Several more were injured from unsafe working practices undertaken whilst heating and inserting its rivets, and the deafness experienced by many of the workers in later years was blamed on the project. Henri Mallard between 1930 and 1932 produced hundreds of stills[32] and film footage[33] which reveal at close quarters of the bravery of the workers in tough Great Depression era conditions.[citation needed] The total financial cost of the bridge was AUÂ£6.25 million, which was not paid off in full until 1988.[34] == Other websites == Harbour Bridge Harbour Bridge Category:Bridges in Australia Category:Steel bridges Category:1932 establishments Category:1930s establishments in Australia",
