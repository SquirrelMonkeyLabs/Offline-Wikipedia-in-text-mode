 "text": "The president of Brazil (), officially the president of the Federative Republic of Brazil () or simply the President of the Republic, is the head of state and head of government of Brazil. The current President is Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva since 2023, who was President of Brazil from 2003 to 2010. ==Requirements== The national constitution says that a president be a native- born citizen of Brazil, at least 35 years of age, a resident of Brazil, a registered voter, and a member of a political party. ==Terms== The president of Brazil can only be president for a term of four years, and may be re- elected for a second four term. This two-term limit, however, is not for life—a former president who has served for two consecutive terms may run for the presidency again after at least one term has ended. ==List== File:Deodoro da Fonseca (1889).jpg| File:Floriano Peixoto (1891).jpg| File:Prudentedemorais.jpg| File:Campos Sales.jpg| File:Rodrigues Alves 3.jpg| File:Afonso Pena.jpg| File:Nilo Peçanha 02.jpg| File:Hermes da Fonseca (1910).jpg| File:Venceslau Brás.jpg| File:Delfim Moreira (1918).jpg| File:Epitacio Pessoa (1919).jpg| File:Artur Bernardes (1922).jpg| File:Washington Luís (foto).jpg| File:Cartão-postal de Campanha de Júlio Prestes - 1930 (cropped).jpg| File:Isaías de Noronha 2, sem data.tif| File:Augusto Tasso Fragoso.jpg| File:João de Deus Menna Barreto, General, 1931.tif| File:Getulio Vargas (1930).jpg| File:José Linhares, presidente dos Estados Unidos do Brasil.tif| File:GASPARDUTRA.jpg| File:17 - Getúlio Dorneles Vargas 1951 derivative.jpg| File:Café Filho.jpg| File:CarlosLuz.jpg| File:Nereu.gif| File:Juscelino.jpg| File:Janio Quadros.png| File:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg| File:Jango.jpg| File:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg| File:Castelobranco.jpg| File:Costa e Silva.jpg| File:Pedro Aleixo.jpg| File:Brigadeiro Márcio de Souza Mello, Ministro da Aeronáutica.tif| File:Aurélio de Lira Tavares, General, Ministro do Exército..tif| File:Augusto Hamann Rademaker Grünewald, Vice-presidente da República.tiff| File:Emílio Garrastazu Médici, presidente da República.
