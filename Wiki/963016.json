 "text": "Risk is the eighth album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. It was released on August 31, 1999 by Capitol Records. Risk was the last Megadeth album to be released by Capitol Records. It is also the last album to have guitarist Marty Friedman playing on it. The album had mixed (good and bad) responses from metal fans and critics, because many did not like how the music on it sounded like alternative rock instead of heavy metal. This reaction made the band make their next album sound more like metal. The band's frontman, Dave Mustaine, has said that the reason that the album did not sell many copies was because Megadeth made it: \"if anybody else's name was on 'Risk', it would have sold\". The album's best position on the Billboard 200 chart was number 16. == Track listing == == References == Category:1999 albums Category:Megadeth albums Category:Capitol Records albums",
