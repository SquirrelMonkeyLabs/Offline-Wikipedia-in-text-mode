 "text": "The Duchy of Bukovina was an Austro-Hungarian Duchy located in Bukovina. When the area was annexed from the Principality of Moldavia to the Habsburg monarchy's domains in 1775 (becoming the Austrian Empire in 1804, then Austria-Hungary in 1867), the name Bukovina was officially adopted. The Polish form Bukowina, which was derived from the Ukrainian word (Bukovyna) and the common Slavic form of buk, which means beech tree, for example in Ukrainian or even Buche in German, was the source of the official German name of the province under Austrian rule (1775â€“1918), die Bukowina. Das Buchenland, another German term for the area, translates to \"beech land\" or \"the land of beech trees\" and is primarily used in poetry.",
