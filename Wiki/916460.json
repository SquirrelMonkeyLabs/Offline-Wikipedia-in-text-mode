 "text": "Miiverse was a social network for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. It was made by Nintendo and Hatena. It was powered by the Nintendo Network. Miiverse was made for people to talk with handwritten messages. In some communities, they made videos of games. You could use Miiverse with any web browser on PC, tablets, and smartphones. All users who got a Nintendo Network ID were given a Miiverse account. They then made a Mii avatar for that Nintendo Network ID. == Shutdown == On August 29, 2017, Nintendo of America said that Miiverse be shut down on November 7, 2017. Users could ask to get posts and screenshots they had made. Replies to posts, however, would not be able to be seen. It was shut down on November 7, 2017, at 10:00 pm PT. Wii U Chat and the Japanese Nintendo TVii were also discontinued at this time. On January 3, 2018, an archive was made of every Miiverse that people could see. It had almost 17TB. This was called \"Archiverse\". ==Notes== == References == Category:2012 establishments Category:2017 disestablishments Category:Nintendo",
