They consist of three islands: * Great Swan Island (3 km long, 5.5 km²) *Little Swan (2.4 km long, 0.5 km wide, 2.5 km²) *Booby Cay (90 metres long, 70 m off the southwest corner of Great Swan, <0.01 km²) Rosario Bank and Misteriosa Bank are 130 to 150 km north of the Swan Islands.

Great Swan has a 3800′ (1158 m) grass airstrip (ICAO code MHIC, IATA code SWA). ==Historical background== Both the United States and Honduras claimed the Swan Islands until the United States dropped its claim. This was under the Guano Islands Act in 1972. The islands gained attention in the early 1960s. This was because of Radio Swan, which began broadcasting in May 1960 during preparation for, and during, the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The station was removed from the islands in the late 1960s. Its main transmitter was transferred for use in the Vietnam War. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch moved over Swan Island with winds of 180 mph. ==References== ==Other websites== * History of the Swan Islands Category:Caribbean islands Category:Islands of Central America Category:Geography of Honduras",
