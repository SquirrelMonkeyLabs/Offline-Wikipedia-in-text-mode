He was removed as President when the Taliban took over in 1996. He then became the leader of the Northern Alliance which took over in Kabul when the Taliban were removed. He became the head of Afghanistan's High Peace Council which was trying to find a way to end the fighting in Afghanistan. He was killed in a suicide attack on his home. A man who claimed to be a Taliban leader met with Rabbini, and then exploded a bomb, which he had hidden in his turban. ==References== Category:Presidents of Afghanistan Category:Assassinated people Category:1940 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Kabul University alumni Category:Badakhshan Province Category:Al-Azhar University alumni Category:20th-century Afghan people Category:National presidents assassinated in the 21st century",
