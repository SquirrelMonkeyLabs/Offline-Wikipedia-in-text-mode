 "text": "Forced labor includes all forms of slavery and related practices including debt slavery, serfdom, human trafficking and labor camps. It is any work or service a person is forced to do against their will. It usually includes a threat of some form of punishment. The International Labour Organization had defined Forced labor as \"all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.\" This was in the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29). Exceptions included work done while serving in a military organization, community service when the work serves the community, and anyone convicted and serving a prison sentence. Convict labor must be supervised by public officials. The convention does not allow convicts to be under the supervision of private individuals, companies or organizations. There are over 29 million people living as slaves today. There are an estimated 60,000 slaves living in the United States. This includes prostitutes and sex workers, illegal immigrants and those held in debt bondage. == References == Category:Labor Category:Human rights abuses",
