 "text": "Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837June 24, 1908) was an American politician who served as the 22nd president of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and as the 24th president from 1893 to 1897. He was the first president to serve nonconsecutive (not back-to-back) terms, and was the only to do so until 2025. He was known for his honesty, integrity, and having a firm stance against corruption. He used the presidential veto power over 500 times, far more than most other presidents, to reject bills he disagreed with. He did not want the United States to get its military involved in Latin America. Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837 in Caldwell, New Jersey. He was raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland studied at New York Institute for the Blind. He was married to Frances Folsom, who was over 20 years younger. In fact, many people expected Cleveland to marry her mother Emma. He was the first president to marry in the White House. They had one child, Ruth Cleveland, during his presidency. During his second term, he had an emergency surgery for jaw cancer on a boat in the middle of a river to avoid publicity. Cleveland died on June 24, 1908 from a heart attack in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 71. ==Notes== == References == == Other websites == *Grover Cleveland's White House biography Category:1837 births Category:1908 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Disease-related deaths in New Jersey Category:People with foods named after them Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Politicians from New Jersey Category:American mayors Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Capitalism",
