 "text": "Class 341 and Class 342 were proposed electric multiple unit classes from the Networker series, they were going to be made in the late 1990s. The trains were planned to run on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and Crossrail projects. Both projects were stopped in the early 1990s because of the early 1990s recession. After the privatisation of British Rail in 1994, neither train was ordered. == Class 341 == Class 341 was meant to be the rolling stock for the Crossrail project, they would have entered service in the late 1990s. A computer-drawing showing the design of the train was made in 1991. The train would have been called the 'Networker Crossrail'. The Crossrail project was rejected by Parliament in 1994, and the train was not made. ==Class 342== Class 342 was meant to be the rolling stock for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) high speed line between London and the Kent coast. Plans for the high speed line were delayed in the early 1990s, and the trains were never made. The CTRL (now High Speed 1) was built from 1998 onwards, and was finished in 2007. Services started running in 2009, operated by Southeastern using Hitachi built Class 395 high speed trains. ==References== 341",
