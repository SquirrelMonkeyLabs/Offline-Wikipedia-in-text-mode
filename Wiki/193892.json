 "text": "2 World Trade Center (also known as 200 Greenwich Street) is a planned skyscraper as part of the planned rebuilding of the new World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. It will replace the original 2 World Trade Center, which was built in 1972 and destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001. The new building will stand on the place where the original 5 World Trade Center was. As of 2013, the building rose up into the air. In 2013, construction was halted as tenants had not been found yet. ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in New York City Category:September 11 attacks Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
