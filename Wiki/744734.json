 "text": "Hankou railway station is one three main railway stations in the city of Wuhan, China. It is in the part of the city known as Hankou. This part of the city is north of the Yangtze and Hanshui rivers. == History == The station began to be used in 1991, for the Jinghan Railway. It replaced the Dazhimen Station that had been used since the rail line had started. Later, the Wuhan Metro line was also connected to the station. The new service started on 28 December 2012. The station is near the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. That market is one of the places where the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic is thought to have started. Thus, it may have spread partly through the station. On 23 January 2020, the station was closed, due to the pandemic, and resumed in operation from March 28 to April 5. == Gallery == Hankou-Dazhimen- Station-0237.jpg|The old Dazhimen Station which was used until 1991 Hankou Railway Station Inside 06.JPG|Waiting Area Hankou railway station platform.jpg|Platform Hankou Railway Station Inside 02.jpg|Corridor == Metro Station == Hankou Station also connects to the Wuhan Metro.
