Zuko is voiced by Dante Basco. He is played by Dev Patel in The Last Airbender and Dallas Liu in the Netflix live action remake. == Development == When Konietzko and DiMartino came up with the show, their producer Eric Coleman asked if they had a Villain. They said they had Ozai and that Aang would fight him at the end of the show. Coleman told them they needed to have an Antagonist before then and that he should be a teenager. Konietzko asked if he could have a scar and Coleman said yes. Konietzko and DiMartino came up with the idea that Zuko would start off as a villain but become a good guy at the end of the show. ==References== Category:Animated characters Category:Characters of Avatar: The Last Airbender",
