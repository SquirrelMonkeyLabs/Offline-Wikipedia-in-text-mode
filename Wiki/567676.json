Alura gave her instructions to protect her baby cousin Kal-El (Superman) who had been sent previously to Earth as well, and told her that due to the Earth yellow's sun, she will obtain extraordinary powers. Kara's spacecraft was hit by a wave of the Krypton explosion and was taken off course to the Phantom Zone, a region in space where time doesn't pass. She stayed there for 24 years, and when the spacecraft escaped for the Phantom Zone and arrived at Earth, she still looked like a 13-year-old girl. Her cousin, Kal-El, had grown up and became Superman. Superman took Kara to be adopted by his friends, the Danvers family. The series begins eleven years old later when the now 24-year-old Kara is learning to use her powers after previously hiding them, while at the same working as a normal person. == Cast == *Melissa Benoist as Kara Zor-El /Kara Danvers /Supergirl *Mehcad Brooks as James Olsen / The Guardian *Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers *Jeremy Jordan as Winn Schott *David Harewood as J'onn J'onzz / Martian Manhunter *Chris Wodd as Mon-El *Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant *Floriana Lima as Maggie Sawyer ==References== Category:American television series Category:Action television series Category:Drama television series Category:CBS network shows Category:English-language television programs",
