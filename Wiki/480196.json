 "text": "Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi ( born c. 1970-4 February 2015) was an Iraqi failed suicide bomber. She has been convicted in the November 9, 2005 Amman bombings in Jordan but survived when her explosive belt failed to detonate. Al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for the triple bombings that hit three hotels. She was sentenced to death as a result of her involvement in the hotel suicide bombings. Jordan executed her on February 4, 2015 in response for the execution of Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh by the ISIS terrorist organization. Jordan had expressed willingness to swap al-Rishawi in exchange for the pilot's safe return, however the pilot had already been killed. ==References== Category:1970s births Category:2015 deaths Category:Al-Qaeda people Category:Executed people Category:Iraqi people Category:Suicide bombers",
