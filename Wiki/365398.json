Muslims in Nigeria are mostly Sunni in the Maliki school, which is also the Sharia law in the government. However, there is a important Shia minority, mostly in Sokoto State (see Shia in Nigeria). A smaller number of people follow the Ahmadiyya Islam, a reformatory sect that started in India in the 19th century. Pew Forum on religious diversity says that 12% are Shia Muslims while 3% are Ahmadi Muslims. ==References== Nigeria Category:History of Nigeria",
