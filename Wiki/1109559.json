In 1874, the manor and buildings belonging to the estate in Zułów burned down completely and the family had to move to Vilnius. Due to anti-tsarist activities and the arrest of Bronisław Piłsudski (Joseph Piłsudski's older brother), the Piłsudski family had to sell all their family property to pay and thus replace the death penalty with 15 years of hard labor and exile to the island of Sakhalin.
