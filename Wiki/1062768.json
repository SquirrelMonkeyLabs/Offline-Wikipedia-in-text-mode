 "text": "The Pumpkin is a 2002 romantic comedy and drama movie. Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder are the directors. ==Plot== Carolyn McDuffy (played by Christina Ricci) is a college senior beginning her final year at a Southern California university. She helps sorority groups win an award when joining in training some intellectually held back or otherwise disabled young adults for the Challenged Games (fictional version of the Special Olympics). Carolyn is paired with Jesse \"Pumpkin\" Romanoff. Romanoff is an intellectually held up and physically disabled kind man. He is kind with her. He begins an affection with Carolyn and vice versa. Jesse is genuine unlike her current boyfriend Kent Woodlands. Carolyn undergoes backlash and hate/contempt about her relationship by her friends and family members. That includes Pumpkin's own mother Judy. The mother walks into her son's bedroom and learns Carolyn and Pumpkin might have become sexually involved. Judy (Pumpkin's mother) accuses Carolyn of rape against her son. Judy then says she (Carolyn) hasn't any idea what the latter did to him. She (Judy) later calls Carolyn's college and that leads to Carolyn being expelled from her sorority and her university. Carolyn tries killing herself by taking pills but then vomits them back up. ==Cast== ==Reception== Roger Ebert gave a positive review to the movie. But the Rotten Tomatoes did almost the opposite saying that Pumpkin had messy premises to its genre.
