 "text": "Technophobia is the fear, or dislike, of more advanced technical devices. Technophobia has occurred since the Industrial Revolution. Very often, artists show technophobia in their works. Two examples of this are Frankenstein, and the movie Metropolis. The Luddites were a movement of textile workers who fought against the use of machines, in the 19th century. == Technophobia in anabaptist groups == Anabaptist groups, such as the Amish or the Mennionites are often shown as being against all modern technology. This image is false, and largely relies on ignorance. These groups are not technophobic, they simply judge the technologies they use: if the technology is useful for the group as a whole, and it does not pose a risk in making the group fall apart, the technology is usually kept. As an example, tractors are used, because they help with agriculture. Cars, on the other hand, are often not used, because they help drive the community apart. == Occurrence == In a study, done between 1992 and 1994 University students in different countries were asked if they were technophobic:Matthieu Guitton: Computers in Human Behavior Elsevier, accessed 5 July 2018. Among the 3.392 participants in the United States, 29% identified as strongly technophobic.; several points are worth noting from Table 2. First, a group of countries including Indonesia, Poland, India, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Mexico and Thailand show large percentages (over 50 %) of technophobic students. In contrast, there are five countries which show under 30 % technophobes (USA, Yugoslavia - Croatia, Singapore, Israel and Hungary). The remaining countries were in between these two groupings. As a comparison, 58% of the Japanese pariicipants identified as technophobic, in India, the number was 82%, and in Mexico, it was 53%. == References == Category:Phobias",
