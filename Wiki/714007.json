 "text": "A hook is a musical idea that is used in popular music to make a song appealing and to \"catch the ear of the listener\". It is usually a short riff, passage, or phrase. The term generally is used for popular music, especially rock, R&B;, hip hop, dance, and pop. In these genres, the hook is often in the chorus. A hook can be either melodic or rhythmic, and often uses the main motif for a piece of music.Davidson, Miriam; Heartwood, Kiya (1996). Songwriting for Beginners, p.7.
