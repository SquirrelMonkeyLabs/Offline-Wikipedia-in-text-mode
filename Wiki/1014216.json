 "text": "The South Vietnamese bug-eyed frog or South Vietnamese bug eye frog (Theloderma vietnamense) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. People have seen it no higher than 1400 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests where the evergreen and broad-leaf trees grow close together. These forests can be in low places, on hills, or on mountains. Sometimes people see this frog in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. This frog lives in holes in trees that have water in them. It hides there during the day and lays eggs there. The male frogs sit on plants near the tree holes and call to the female frogs. The female frogs come to the tree holes and lay eggs above the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Two or three female frogs may lay eggs in the same hole with the same male frog. Scientists say this frog is in some danger because human beings cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, especially for rubber, coffee, and tea. They also think people might catch the frog to sell because it is so beautiful. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Phu Quoc National Park, Nui Ong Nature Reserve, Vinh Cuu Nature Reserve, Kon Ka Kinh Nature Reserve, Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve, Dong Nai Bioshpere Reserve, and others. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
