 "text": "The Etruscan language was spoken and written by the Etruscans in the ancient area of Etruria (what is now Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Latium) and in parts of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna (where the Gauls took the place of the Etruscans), in Italy. Inscriptions have been found in northwestern and west-central Italy in the region that still has a name that came from the Etruscans, Tuscany (from Latin tusc \"Etruscans\") and in Latium, north of Rome, in Umbria west of the Tiber, around Capua in Campania and in the Po Valley to the north of Etruria. That is probably the area in Italy in which the language was once spoken. == Other websites == * Etruscan News Online, the Newsletter of the American Section of the Institute for Etruscan and Italic Studies. *Etruscan News back issues , Center for Ancient Studies at New York University. *Etruscology at Its Best, the website of Dr. Dieter H.
