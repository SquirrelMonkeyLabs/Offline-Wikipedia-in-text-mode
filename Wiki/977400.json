 "text": "At Play, Vol. 4 is a compilation album. It is from the Canadian progressive house musician deadmau5. It is also the fourth of the At Play series. Like the other \"At Play\" albums, this instalment contains tracks previously released on the 2006 album Vexillology and the 2007 EP Full Circle. At Play, Vol. 4 also includes the track \"GH-XSW\" (renamed \"GH\"), which was \"created in the days before Get Scraped.\" The track also reuses a sample from the track \"Sometimes I Fail\". Like with At Play Vol. 3, deadmau5 claims to have nothing to do with this volume of At Play. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:Deadmau5 albums Category:2012 albums",
