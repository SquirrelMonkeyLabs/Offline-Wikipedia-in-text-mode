 "text": "A cold front is a meteorological word describing the movement of a cooler air mass into an area of warmer air.University of Illinois. Cold Front. Retrieved on 2006-10-22. The air with greater density moves under the less dense warmer air, lifting it, which can create a line of showers and thunderstorms, or a squall line to form when there is sufficient moisture. This upward motion causes lowered pressure along the cold front. On weather maps, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles or spikes pointing in the direction of its movement. Cold fronts can also move up to twice as fast as warm fronts. ==Precipitation== Rain, snow, hail, and other forms of precipitation can happen with cold fronts. ==Effects== Cold fronts can bring dry and colder air behind it. Temperatures can drop to 15 Â°F behind cold fronts, and it can get very windy. ==References== Category:Cold Category:Meteorology",
