 "text": "Almond flour (also called almond meal) is a type of flour made from blended almonds. The almonds used are usually blanched (with the skin removed). It feels like corn meal rather than wheat flour. It is used in baking some foods like pastry. Almond flour has been used in baking foods for low-carbohydrate diets. It adds moistness and a nutty taste to baked goods. Items baked with almond flour are usually calorie-heavy. Almonds are high in polyunsaturated fats. The omega 6 fatty acids in almonds are protected from oxidation by the skin and vitamin E. When almonds are ground, this protective skin is broken and exposed surface area increases dramatically, greatly making it more likely for the nut to oxidize. ==References== F Category:Flour",
