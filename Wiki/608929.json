 "text": "Stevens MRT Station (DT10/TE11) is an underground interchange station on the Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit system. This station is one of four to have faregates on the same level as the platforms. The others are Bishan, Expo and Changi Airport stations. Due to space constraints, the two platforms at the station are seperated from each other and have their own faregates. A ten minute grace period was put in place by the Land Transport Authority in case passengers tap in at the wrong faregates. The Stevens station is located at the junction of Bukit Timah road and Stevens road, where the station takes its name from. ==History== This station opened on 27 December 2015, along with the rest of the Downtown line stage 2. The Thomson East Coast line section opened on 13 November 2021, as part of stage 3 of the line. ==References== Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:2015 establishments in Asia Category:2010s establishments in Singapore",
