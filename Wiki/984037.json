 "text": "Lampriformes is an order of ray-finned fish. They are known as lamprids. A synonym for this order is called Lampridiformes, but it is an apparently incorrect spelling variant. == Description and ecology == Lampriformes are pelagic feeders that stay well above the sea floor, and normally occur in waters 100–1000 m deep. As adults, they're brightly colored, often with brilliant crimson fins. Some are rounded in lateral view, while others are very elongated. One of them, the giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne), is the longest known bony fish. == Families and genera == === Families === ==== Extant ==== * Family Veliferidae — sailfin moonfish * Family Lampridae — opahs * Family Trachipteridae — ribbonfish * Family Regalecidae — oarfish * Family Lophotidae — crestfish ==== Extinct ==== * Family Turkmenidae (fossil) === Genera === ==== Extant ==== * Genus Lampris (opahs) * Genus Radiicephalus (tapertail) * Genus Agrostichthys (streamer fish) * Genus Regalecus * Genus Desmodema * Genus Trachipterus * Genus Zu * Genus Eumecichthys * Genus Lophotus * Genus Metavelifer * Genus Velifer ==== Extinct ==== * Genus Bathysoma (fossil) * Genus Nardovelifer (fossil) * Genus Palaeocentrotus (fossil) * Genus Veronavelifer (fossil) * Genus Oechsleria (fossil) * Genus Wettonius (fossil) * Genus Megalampris (fossil) == Related pages == * Bandfish == Footnotes == # ^ Nelson (2006): pp.226,228 # ^ Woodhouse (1910), Glare (1968-1982), FishBase (2006), Nelson (2006): pp.226-230 # ^ Woodhouse (1910), Olney (1998), Nelson (2006): p.226 # ^ Jump up to:a b Olney (1998), Nelson (2006): p.226 # ^ Nelson (2006): p.226, Diogo (2008) # ^ Nelson (2006): pp.226-230 == References == # Woodhouse, S.C.
