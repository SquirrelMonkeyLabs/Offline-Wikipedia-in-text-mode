 "text": "Andrea Moda Formula, also known as Andrea Moda, was a Formula One team. It raced in the 1992 Formula One season. It was made by Andrea Sassetti. He was a shoe maker in Italy. == Issues == The team was taken out from the opening race in South Africa. This is because they did not pay the one hundred thousand fee for new teams. The team was put in the next race in Brazil. Roberto Moreno and Perry McCarthy would drive. The cars were still not ready. At the race in San Marino, the car was finally ready. McCarthy did not get his Super License, which is needed to race a F1 car. The car later had to be retired. This was because it was having an engine problem. In Canada, the team did not have engines because Sassetti did not pay the engine supplier, Judd, the money. The team also missed France due to their car being stuck in a blockade by French truck drivers. In August of 1992, the FIA warned the team that they might be excluded (disqualified, does not count) from the championship. It was a known fact that McCarthy was barely given a chance, since the team could not afford to properly run two cars, so they mainly worked on Moreno's car while McCarthy was only there to meet the rules of having two cars in the race. Finally, at the Belgian Grand Prix, Sassetti was arrested for forging invoices. The team was not allowed in the field at the Italian Grand Prix. ==Complete Formula One results== (key) (results in bold indicate pole position) Year Chassis Engine Tyres Drivers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Points WCC 1992 Andrea Moda C4B Andrea Moda S921 Judd GV 3.5 L V10 RSA MEX BRA ESP SMR MON CAN FRA GBR GER HUN BEL ITA POR JPN AUS 0 NC Alex Caffi EX DNP Enrico Bertaggia EX DNP Roberto Moreno DNPQ DNPQ DNPQ Ret DNPQ DNA DNPQ DNPQ DNQ DNQ DNP Perry McCarthy DNP DNPQ DNPQ DNPQ DNP DNA DNPQ EX DNPQ DNQ DNP Category:Formula One constructors Category:1990s disestablishments in Italy Category:1992 disestablishments in Europe",
