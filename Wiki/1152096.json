 "text": "World War I had a significant impact on Latvia, starting in 1914 when the region was part of the Russian Empire. The war brought destruction, mass displacement, and political changes. Many Latvians were mobilized into the Russian army, and the war accelerated the movement toward Latvian independence. == Major events in Latvia during WWI == * Early War Years (1914–1915): ** The war began with German attacks on Latvian coastal towns like Liepāja, where German naval forces shelled the city in August 1914. ** By 1915, the German army advanced into Latvia, capturing key areas in Kurzeme (Courland). This led to large-scale evacuations and the displacement of thousands of Latvians. * Formation of Latvian Riflemen (1915): To resist the German advance, special Latvian Riflemen units (Latviešu strēlnieki) were formed within the Russian army. These units became famous for their bravery in battles, such as the defense of Riga and the Christmas Battles in 1916. * Occupation and Retreat (1917): In 1917, much of Latvia, including Riga, fell under German occupation. This drastically affected the local population, with many fleeing eastward into Russia as refugees. * Path toward independence (1918): The war ended with the collapse of the Russian Empire and Germany’s defeat. These events set the stage for the proclamation of Latvian independence on November 18, 1918. The struggle for independence continued during the Latvian War of Independence (1918–1920). == Impact on the population == The war caused immense suffering for Latvians. Hundreds of thousands became refugees, and many areas were devastated by fighting. Latvian society was deeply affected by the loss of life, destruction of infrastructure, and economic hardship. == Legacy == World War I is remembered in Latvia as a time of great sacrifice and a crucial period leading to independence. Sites like the cemeteries of Latvian Riflemen and memorials commemorate the contributions of Latvians to the war effort. Category:World War I Category:History of Latvia",
