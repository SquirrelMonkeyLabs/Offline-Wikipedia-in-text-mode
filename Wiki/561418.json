During Trump's presidential campaign, activists organized demonstrations inside Trump rallies who sometimes called for the rallies to be shut down. After Trump won the presidential election, students and activists made larger protests in several major cities across the United States. The protesters chanted that Trump is \"Not my President!\" and other slogans. ==References== Category:2010s protests Category:Donald Trump Category:Politics of the United States",
