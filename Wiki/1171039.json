This realm is populated by various dream-related beings, such as nightmares and dream creatures. == Powers and abilities == As a personification of dreams, he has the ability to manipulate dreams, influence consciousness, and even grant or take away the ability to dream. His powers also extend to shaping the Dreaming realm itself. == Narrative role == The series follows Dream's journey over centuries as he grapples with his responsibilities, relationships with other Endless, and interactions with humans.
