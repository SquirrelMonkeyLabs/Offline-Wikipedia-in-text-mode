Benko's highest achievement was qualifying and competing in the Candidates Tournament—the tournament to decide the challenger for the World Championship—in 1959 and 1962. He finished eighth in 1959 and sixth in 1962. Benko also qualified for the 1970 Interzonal tournament, but he gave his place to Bobby Fischer. Fischer later won the World Championship in 1972. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American chess players Category:Hungarian chess players Category:Chess grandmasters",
