 "text": "The Trujillo collared frog (Mannophryne trujillensis) is a frog. It lives in the Serranía de Ziruma in Trujillo in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains. It can live in streams in forests that are growing back. People see them under roads and in other places that people have changed. Scientists saw the frog between 700 and 1800 meters above sea level. The place where the frog lives touches two protected places Santo Domingo-Motatán and Río Castán river protection places. ==Young== The male frogs sit on rocks next to streams and call to the female frogs during the day. Scientists think the frog has young the same way as other frogs in Mannophryne: The female frog lays eggs on land, and, after the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms for cocoa and food to eat and to raise animals. Human beings move streams to get water for farms. Bad chemicals from farms and from waste and human water waste can also hurt this frog. Scientists think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also kill the frogs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
