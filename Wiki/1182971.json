 "text": "The Feast of the Black Nazarene, officially and liturgically the Feast of Jesús Nazareno, is a religious festival held in the Philippines; colloquially referred to as the Traslación, during which the image of the Black Nazarene is borne and passed shoulder to shoulder by devotees in a procession along the streets of Quiapo, Manila. \"Traslacion\" describes the act of moving the Black Nazarene, an image dating from the 16th century of Jesus Christ; celebrated annually on the 9th of January. ==Image== ==History== The Feast of the Black Nazarene marks the traditional Feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus (the original dedication of Quiapo Church), celebrated by an annual procession of the image of the Nazarene along the streets of Quiapo, Manila. Despite no extant historical record to confirm the exact date, the devotional Traslación is recounted to have occured in January of 1787 when the Nazarene's image was delivered to Quiapo Church from its origin in Spain. Obscurity notwithstanding, the 9th of January is now considered as the image's national liturgical feast day. == Observances in other places == * Similar processions replicating the Traslación in Quiapo, Manila are held in other parts of the Philippines. The largest of these is one held in the city of Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao, which uses an official replica of the Black Nazarene image bequeathed by the Minor Basilica in 2009. It has since become a focal point for Roman Catholic devotion in Mindanao. * A replica of the Black Nazarene arrived at the Old Chapel of St. Rock the Healer Mission Center in Barangay Cawayan, Catarman, Northern Samar from the Minor Basilica on March 4, 2014. On January 9, 2015, the first Traslación was held when the sacred image was carried from the old church to a new church building, which was consecrated by Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle on September 12, 2016. On August 18, 2019, the shrine became the first barangay-based parish in the Diocese of Catarman. ==References== Category:Quiapo Category:Christianity in the Philippines",
