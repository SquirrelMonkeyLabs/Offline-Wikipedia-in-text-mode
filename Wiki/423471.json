 "text": "Wii Sports Club/Wii Sports 3 is a sports video game for the Wii U. It has high definition ports of the sports seen in the 2006 Wii video game Wii Sports which can be downloaded from the Wii U's eShop service. The first two sports, bowling and tennis, were released in Japan on October 30, 2013, in Europe and North America on November 7, 2013, and in Australia and New Zealand on November 8, 2013. Other sports will be released at a later date. Like in Wii Sports, players use the Wii Remote to make movements like the ones seen in sports, including tennis, bowling, baseball, golf, and boxing. However, like in Wii Sports Resort, the player has to use the Wii MotionPlus to play the game. Players can join clubs that are of different places around the world. They can play against people in the club. Players can talk to other players with messages and drawings from the Wii U GamePad. The game is really nice because of that. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2013 video games Category:Baseball video games Category:Bowling video games Category:Boxing video games Category:Golf video games Category:Multiple-sport video games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Nintendo video games Category:Tennis video games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii U games",
