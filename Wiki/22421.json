 "text": "Yi I (1536 – 1584) was a Korean Confucian scholar. His mother was a famous calligraphist, Shin Saimdang. He was very intelligent as a child, learning to read at three and being very bright at his studies. He was also devoted to his parents: when his mother was sick, he prayed to his ancestors to heal her; and when his father was sick, he cut his own finger with a knife and let his father drink his blood (at that time, people thought human blood was very good medicine). == Works == * Seonghakjipyo (성학집요 聖學輯要) * Gyeokmongyogyeol (격몽요결 擊蒙要訣) * Donghomundap (동호문답 東湖問答) * Gijasilgi (기자실기 箕子實記) * Gyeongyeonilgi (경연일기 經筵日記) * Suneon (순언 醇言) Category:Korean people Category:Confucianism Category:1536 births Category:1584 deaths",
