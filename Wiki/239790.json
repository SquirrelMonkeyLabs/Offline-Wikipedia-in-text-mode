 "text": "Conspiracy of One is the sixth album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 2000. The album debuted at 9 on the US Billboard 200 with around 125,000 copies sold in its first week and has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide. It is the follow-up to the commercially successful Americana. The Offspring had come out in support of file sharing, claiming it does not hurt sales. This album was originally planned to be released directly on their website before retail, until their label threatened to sue. Conspiracy of One is also the band's final studio album with the most successful line-up, as drummer Ron Welty left band in early 2003 to pursue his career with Steady Ground. ==Track listing== # \"Intro\" – 0:08 # \"Come Out Swinging\" – 2:47 # \"Original Prankster\" (with Redman) – 3:42 # \"Want You Bad\" – 3:23 # \"Million Miles Away\" – 3:40 # \"Dammit, I Changed Again\" – 2:49 # \"Living in Chaos\" – 3:28 # \"Special Delivery\" – 3:00 # \"One Fine Day\" – 2:45 # \"All Along\" – 1:39 # \"Denial, Revisited\" – 4:33 # \"Vultures\" – 3:35 # \"Conspiracy of One\" – 2:17 ==Personnel== * Dexter Holland - Vocals and Guitar * Noodles - Lead Guitar * Greg K. - Bass * Ron Welty - Drums ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:The Offspring albums Category:Pop punk albums Category:Columbia Records albums",
