 "text": "AUKUS, also known as Aukus (; is an acronym for the alliance between \"Australia, United Kingdom, United States\"), is a three-way security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The agreement was created in 2020 to share defense technologies between the three countries to answer the possible threat China poses. ==Rules== It allows Australia to buy its first nuclear submarines, though the Australian government says that the boats will not be nuclear armed. These nuclear-powered submarines would be completed and ready for service in the mid to late 2030s. Experts say the nuclear subs can take longer trips than other submarines. They say the boats will give the alliance a stronger military presence in the region. The alliance also is to share computing technologies and cyber defenses. However, the agreement also led to a cancellation of a submarine deal between Australia and France. France was angry at the countries involved and recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the United States in response. ==References== Category:September 2021 events Category:2021 in the United Kingdom Category:2021 in the United States Category:2020s in Australia Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom Category:Treaties of the United States",
