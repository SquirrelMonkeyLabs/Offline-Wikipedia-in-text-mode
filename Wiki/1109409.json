 "text": "The Port Mann Bridge is a 10-lane cable-stayed bridge, 90 km/h (55 mph) speed limit, in British Columbia, Canada, that opened to traffic in 2012. It carries 10 lanes of traffic with space for a light rail line. The cable-stayed bridge replaced a steel arch bridge that spanned about 2 km over the Fraser River, connecting Coquitlam to Surrey in British Columbia in the Vancouver metro area. After its successor was opened to traffic, the old bridge was removed by reverse construction, a process which took 3 years to complete. ==References== Category:Bridges in Canada Category:British Columbia",
