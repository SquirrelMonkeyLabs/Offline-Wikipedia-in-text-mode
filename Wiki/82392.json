 "text": "14 Irene is a very big Main belt asteroid. 14 Irene was found by J. R. Hind on May 19, 1851, and named after Eirene, a personification of peace in Greek mythology. She was one of the Horae, daughter of Zeus and Themis. The name was suggested by Sir John Herschel. Hind wrote, :\"You will readily discover that this name [...] has some relation to this event (the Great Industrial Exhibition) which is now filling our metropolis [London] with the talent of all civilised nations, with those of Peace, the productions of Art and Science, in which all mankind must feel an interest.\" The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations in the Crystal Palace of Hyde Park, London ran from May 1 until October 18, 1851. Hind suggested that the symbol for the asteroid should be \"A dove carrying an olive-branch, with a star on its head\", but an actual drawing of the symbol was never made before the use of graphical symbols to represent asteroids was no longer used. There have been four reported stellar occultations by Irene. == References == * Gould, B.A., New planet, Astronomical Journal, Vol. 2, iss. 27, p. 22, June 1851 == Other websites == * Orbital simulation from JPL (Java) / Ephemeris Category:Asteroids",
