 "text": "A catkin is a slim flower cluster (a \"spike\") that is usually wind-pollinated but sometimes insect-pollinated. It has many flowers arranged closely along a drooping central stem.Cronk Q.C.B; Needham I. and Rudall P.J. 2015. Evolution of catkins: inflorescence morphology of selected Salicaceae in an evolutionary and developmental context. Frontiers in Plant Science. 6: 1030. Usually, it is unisexual. It is found in many plant families, including Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Moraceae, and Salicaceae. The catkin flower arrangement has arisen at least twice independently by convergent evolution in Fagales and Salicaceae. == References == Category:Flowering plants",
