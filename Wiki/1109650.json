 "text": "Thanos is a fictional character first portrayed by Damian Poitier and then by Josh Brolin, based on the Marvel Comics supervillain of the same name. He is the overall main antagonist of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise, serving as the overarching antagonist of The Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) before appearing as both the main antagonist/villain protagonist of Avengers: Infinity War (2018). He returns in Avengers: Endgame (2019), the animated series What If...? (2021-2024), and the movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). His own main objective was to bring stability from the universe, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire resources and condemn it. However, his methodology to succeed was warped; through using the Infinity Stones, Thanos intended to harness their power to exterminate half of life in the universe. == Appearances == === Movie appearances === Year Movie Portrayed by 2012 The Avengers (cameo appearance) Damian Poitier 2014 Guardians of the Galaxy Josh Brolin 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron 2018 Avengers: Infinity War 2019 Avengers: Endgame === Television appearances === Year Television series Seasons Episodes Portrayed by 2021-2024 What If...? 3 26 Josh Brolin (voice) Category:Marvel Comics movie characters Category:Fictional dictators Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Galactic emperors Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe characters",
