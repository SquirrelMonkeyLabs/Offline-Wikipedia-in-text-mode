 "text": "Organic synthesis is a special part of chemical synthesis. It builds organic compounds using organic reactions. Organic molecules can have a higher level of complexity compared to inorganic compounds. So, the synthesis of organic compounds has developed into one of the most important parts of organic chemistry. There are two main areas of research fields within the general area of organic synthesis: total synthesis and methodology. ==Other websites== * The Organic Synthesis Archive * Chemical synthesis database * http://www.webreactions.net/search.html * https://www.organic- chemistry.org/synthesis/ * Natural product syntheses * Chemical synthesis semantic wiki Category:Chemical synthesis Category:Organic chemistry",
