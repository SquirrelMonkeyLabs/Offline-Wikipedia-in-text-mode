 "text": "The History of Australia (1851–1900) refers to the history of the people of the Australian continent during the 50-year period which preceded the foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. == Gold rush and its effects == The discovery of gold in 1851 in New South Wales and Victoria brought many people to Australia. This period, known as the gold rush, boosted the economy and led to high immigration, especially from China, Britain, and America. However, tensions arose, particularly at the Eureka Rebellion in 1854, where miners protested unfair taxes and lack of voting rights. This event is seen as a symbol of Australia's fight for democracy. == Self- government == From 1855, most Australian colonies began to govern themselves while still part of the British Empire. Colonies like New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia created constitutions allowing elected governments, though Britain retained control of defense and foreign policy. Western Australia gained self-government much later in 1890. == Exploration and expansion == Explorers, such as Burke and Wills and John McDouall Stuart, mapped inland Australia during this period. These expeditions opened up new areas for grazing and settlement, but often disregarded the knowledge and presence of Indigenous peoples. == Impact on indigenous Australians == The expansion of farming and settlements displaced Aboriginal communities, leading to violence and disease. Many were forced onto missions or reserves. By 1900, their population had dramatically declined due to these factors. == Towards federation == During the late 19th century, Australia’s six colonies discussed uniting to form a single nation. The Federal Council of Australasia was established in 1885, and by 1901, Australia became a federation under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. == Economic development == The economy grew with industries like wool production and mining, supported by British investments. Immigrants, mostly from the UK, brought labor and skills to sustain this growth. However, economic inequality persisted, and debates on issues like workers' rights intensified.
