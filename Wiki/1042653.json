 "text": "The Sultan of Egypt was a title given to the leaders of Egypt after the Ayyubid dynasty of Saladin began ruling in 1174. This continued until Egypt was taken over by the Ottomans in 1517. The extent of the Egyptian Sultan's power changed over time, but it usually included areas like Sham and Hejaz. Because of this, the Ayyubid and later Mamluk sultans were also seen as the rulers of Syria. From 1914, the title was used again by the leaders of the Muhammad Ali dynasty of Egypt and Sudan. Later, in 1922, it was changed to the title of King of Egypt and Sudan. == Ayyubid dynasty == Before Saladin became powerful, Egypt was the main place for the Shia Fatimid Caliphate. This was the only time in Islamic history when the Shia branch of Islam ruled a caliphate. The Fatimids had wanted to replace the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq for a long time. Like the Abbasid group, they also called themselves Caliphs. This showed they thought they were at the highest level in Islam. But when Saladin became strong in 1169, Egypt changed back to being Sunni and following the Abbasid Caliphate. Saladin saw the Abbasid Caliph as his leader in theory. In 1174, Saladin became a Sultan instead of a Caliph. From this time until the Ottoman takeover, the highest power in the caliphate was with the Sultan of Egypt.
