It was established by President Barack Obama in 2011. ==What do they do?== It is responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector. They work within banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors and other financial companies operating in the United States. ==Creation== The CFPB's creation was made by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the eventual Great Recession. The CFPB was established as an independent agency, but this status is being reviewed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. ==Leadership== The CFPB is headed by a director who is appointed by the President for a five-year term. The bureau is also assisted by a Consumer Advisory Council, which is composed of at least six members who are recommended by regional Federal Reserve presidents. The first director of the CFPB was Ohio politician Richard Cordray who served from 2012 through 2017. The current Acting Director is Russell Vought since February 7, 2025. On February 11, 2025, President Donald Trump nominated Jonathan McKernan to serve as director. ==2020 Supreme Court decision== The Supreme Court of the United State (SCOTUS), in a 5-to-4 decision, ruled June 29, 2020, that the structure of the CFPB violates the separation-of-powers clause of the constitution since the bill directed that the CFPB director could be removed by the president only for \"cause,\" defined as \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. ==List of directors== ; Status No. Portrait Name State of residence Took office Left office Tenure Presidents – Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts September 17, 2010 August 1, 2011 Barack Obama – Raj Date District of Columbia August 1, 2011 January 4, 2012 Richard Cordray Ohio January 4, 2012 November 24, 2017 ( total) Donald Trump – Leandra English New York November 25, 2017 November 25, 2017 – Mick Mulvaney South Carolina November 25, 2017 December 11, 2018 Kathy Kraninger Ohio December 11, 2018 January 20, 2021 – Dave Uejio District of Columbia January 20, 2021 October 12, 2021 Joe Biden Rohit Chopra District of Columbia October 12, 2021 February 1, 2025 Rohit Chopra District of Columbia October 12, 2021 February 1, 2025 ( total) Donald Trump – Zixta Martinez Texas February 1, 2025 February 3, 2025 – Scott Bessent South Carolina February 3, 2025 February 7, 2025 – Russell Vought Virginia February 7, 2025 Incumbent Jonathan McKernan Tennessee TBD ==Notes== ==References== Category:2011 establishments in the United States *",
