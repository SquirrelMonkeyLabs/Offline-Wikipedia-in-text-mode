 "text": "The Honda Pilot is a mid-sized four-door crossover utility vehicle made by Honda. It was first made in 2002 as a 2003 model. The vehicle replaced Honda's compact SUV, the Passport, which was actually a rebadged Isuzu Rodeo. The Pilot is built on the Accord platform, which also underpins the Odyssey minivan and the Ridgeline pickup truck. The vehicle was redesigned in 2009. It has three rows of seats. The vehicle has limited off-road capability but does allow wading through nineteen inches of water. The Pilot was Honda's largest crossover up until the introduction of the Crosstour, a station wagon based SUV built on the Accord platform. While it is longer than the Pilot it doesn't allow seating for 7-8 passengers. The Pilot has been compared with other crossover cars and sport utility vehicles. The Pilot was redesigned in 2015 for the 2016 model year. It no longer has a boxy crossover look. It now looks more like the Honda Odyssey. Its 6-cylinder engine is now more powerful and mated to 6- and 9-speed automatic transmissions. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official Honda Pilot Site * Latest Honda Pilot Overview & Pictures Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles Category:2020s automobiles Pilot",
