 "text": "Tutnese or Double Dutch is a language game primarily used in English, although the rules can be easily modified to apply to almost any language. Tutnese is usually used by children, who use it to converse in privacy from adults; by members of historically marginalized minority groups for the same reason when in the presence of authority figures such as police (\"pupolulisus\" or \"pizolizice\"); or simply for amusement and humor.
