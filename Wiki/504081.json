With over 80,000 objects, it is one of the world's best collections of objects from Egypt and the Sudan. ==History== The museum started in 1892 to help with the teaching of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology. The collection began with objects given to the museum by the writer Amelia Edwards.Moon, Brenda E.: More usefully employed : Amelia B. Edwards, writer, traveller and campaigner for ancient Egypt. London : Egypt Exploration Society, 2006. William Flinders PetrieMargaret S. Drower, Flinders Petrie: A Life in Archaeology, (2nd publication) University of Wisconsin Press, 1995. led many important archaeological digs.William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Seventy Years in Archaeology, H. Holt and Company 1932 In 1913 he sold his collection to University College. He had found objects at major sites, such as the Roman Period cemeteries at Hawara. These were famous for the beautiful mummy portraits in classical Roman style.Janet Picton, Stephen Quirke, and Paul C. Roberts (eds), “Living Images: Egyptian Funerary Portraits in the Petrie Museum.” 2007. Left Coast Press, Walnut Creek. He found objects at Amarna, the city of king Akhenaten, the first king to believe in one God.Petrie, W. M. Flinders Sir, 1853-1942 Tell el-Amarna, London, Methuen & co. At Meydum, the site of the first true pyramid Petrie found some of the earliest examples of mummification. The collection and library were in rooms at the university. A book about the collection was printed in 1915. At first the museum was only for people studying and not open to the public. After Petrie retired in 1933, other archaeologists added objects to the collection. These had been found in other parts of Egypt and the Sudan. During the Second World War (1939–1945) the collection was packed up and moved out of London for to keep it safe. In the early 1950s it was moved into an old stable, beside the science library. ==Collections== The museum has one of the oldest pieces of linen from Egypt, made about 5000 BC. There are two lions from the temple of Min at Koptos. These were part of the first group of monumental sculpture from about 3000 BC. There is a small piece from the first king list or calendar written about 2900 BC. The museum has some iron beads, the earliest example of metal from Egypt. There is the earliest example of glazing.
