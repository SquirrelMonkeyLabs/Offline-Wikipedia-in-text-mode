 "text": "Caihong () is an extinct dinobird from Late Jurassic China. Caihong was discovered in 2014. The animal may predate the famous Aurornis xui, the earliest bird, by about 1 million years.Dongyu Hu; Julia A. Clarke; Chad M. Eliason; Rui Qiu; Quanguo Li; Matthew D. Shawkey; Cuilin Zhao; Liliana Dâ€™Alba; Jinkai Jiang; Xing Xu (2018). \"A bony-crested Jurassic dinosaur with evidence of iridescent plumage highlights complexity in early paravian evolution\". Nature Communications. 9: Article number 217. The type species, Caihong juji, was named in 2018. ==Description== ===Size=== Caihong was a rather small dinosaur. Its length was estimated at , and its weight at . ===Skeleton=== The skull of Caihong has a length of 67.6 millimetres. It is low and elongated (superficially similar to that of Velociraptor), only slightly shorter than the femur. ====Vertebrae==== Caihong probably has ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and twenty-sic tail vertebrae. ===Feathering and coloration=== The fossilized feathers of Caihong showed similarity to a black iridescent color in extant birds. Other feathers found on the head, chest, and the base of the tail preserve flattened sheets of platelet-like melanosomes. Caihong represents the oldest known evidence of platelet-like melanosomes. ==References== Category:Fossil taxa described in 2018 Category:Feathered dinosaurs",
