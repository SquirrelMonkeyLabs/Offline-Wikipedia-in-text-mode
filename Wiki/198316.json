Wolfgang Paul died December 7 of 1993 at his residence in Bonn. == Scientific research == During WWII he investigated the separation of isotopes, which is necessary to produce material to make nuclear fission for use in nuclear weapons. He started his research into ions, developing the so-called ion trap. For this discovery, in 1989 he was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with Hans G. Dehmelt. Between 1965 and 1967, he was appointed Director of the Division of Nuclear Physics at CERN. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1993 deaths Category:German physicists Category:German Nobel Prize winners Category:Academics of the University of Bonn Category:Academics of the University of Göttingen",
