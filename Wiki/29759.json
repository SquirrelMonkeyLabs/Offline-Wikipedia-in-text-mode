Protests have also been held against Jews and some protests have included WBC members stomping on the American flag. ==Affiliation== The WBC is not affiliated with any Baptist denomination. The Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention (the two largest Baptist denominations) have each denounced the WBC over the years.
