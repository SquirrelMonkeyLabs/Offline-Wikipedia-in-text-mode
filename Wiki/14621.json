 "text": "Saturday Night Fever is a 1977 American drama movie. It stars John Travolta as a 19 year old working-class Italian American man named Tony Manero. Manero lives with his parents and works in a dead-end job at a small hardware store. He tries to escape his problem-filled life in Brooklyn by dancing at a nightclub in New York City. The soundtrack (an album that has disco songs that were heard in the movie) of the movie includes music by the Bee Gees and many other artists. Both the album and movie were very popular. There are two versions of the movie: the original R-rated version and the PG-rated version which came out a year later so the movie could be popular with younger people. A sequel called Staying Alive was released in 1983 also starring John Travolta.Staying Alive page at Rotten Tomatoes ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1977 drama movies Category:American drama movies Category:Dance movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies set in New York City Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Movies directed by John Badham",
