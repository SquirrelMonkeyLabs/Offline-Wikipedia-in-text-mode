 "text": "A railway electrification system supplies electrical energy to railway locomotives and multiple units so that they can operate without having an on- board prime mover. Their main advantages are high energy efficiency and low operating cost. Building their wires and other infrastructure is expensive, however. ==Power supply== Electricity may be sent to the train in different ways. Different countries use different systems. The most widely used systems are: * Alternating current from overhead lines at 15,000 volts, 16.7 Hz * Alternating current from overhead lines at 25,000 volts, 50 Hz * Direct current from overhead lines at 1,500 or 3,000 volts * Direct current from a third rail at 600 or 750 volts ==Related pages== * Electric locomotive Category:Rail infrastructure Category:Rail technologies Category:Electric railways",
