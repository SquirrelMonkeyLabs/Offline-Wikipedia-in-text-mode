 "text": "Dracaena trifasciata (also known as \"Mother-in-law's tongue\", \"Saint George's sword\" or the \"snake plant\") is a plant that can grow in many places. It is a desert plant from dry Africa. It is a succulent that stores water in its very thick, tough leaves. That means that it does not need to be watered every day. It does not need sunlight to grow and can stay in the same pot for many years. This plant grows better with less water than more water. == Gallery == Image:Sansevieria trifasciata and Ficus pumila 'Variegata' 2448px.jpg Image:Sansevieria trifasciata Closeup 2448px.jpg Image:Sansevieria trifasciata bud.jpg|Sansevieria trifasciata flower bud Image:Sansevieria trifasciata flowers.JPG Image:snake plant.jpg Category:Asparagales",
