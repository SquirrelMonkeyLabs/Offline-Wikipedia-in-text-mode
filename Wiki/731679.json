 "text": "\"The Best of Rock za Hrvatsku\" (Rock for Croatia) was a popular album of anti- war and patriotic songs by many different songwriters and bands (a compilation album). It was released in 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. Some of the artists whose songs were in this album were popular across Yugoslavia before it broke up, like Psihomodo pop, Jura Stublić, Parni valjak, Boa, and Aerodrom's Jura Pađen. They took a pro-Croatian stance as the Yugoslav Wars began, while other popular songwriters and bands like Azra did not have their songs in the album because they broke up. The album also made some new people popular, like the dance group ET, rock band Thompson and others. They would become the first specifically Croatian bands. == Songs == #\"Croatia in Flames\" (3:12) by Montažstroj and H.C.
