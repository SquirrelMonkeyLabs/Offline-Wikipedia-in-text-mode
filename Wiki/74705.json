 "text": "Dark Horse Comics is an American company that creates comic books and manga. It is one of the largest \"independent\" comic book publishers. The company was founded by Mike Richardson. Richardson is the owner of several comic book shops in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. In 1986, he began to publish an anthology series called Dark Horse Presents using money from his stores. The company is based in Milwaukie, Oregon. ==Overview== Dark Horse creates many comics based on other peoples characters and settings. These include comics based on Star Wars, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Aliens, and Who Wants to be a Superhero? Dark Horse also publishes comics by artists who own their own settings. These include Frank Miller's Sin City and 300, Mike Mignola's Hellboy, Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo, Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira and Michael Chabon's The Escapist. From 1993-1996, Dark Horse published a line of superhero comics under the name Comics Greatest World. This was later renamed Dark Horse Heroes. After 1996, publication in this line slowed greatly. They stopped making any books about the characters in the early 2000's. Today, the company does very well even though they do not have their own universe of superpowered characters. Dark Horse's movie company, Dark Horse Entertainment, creates movies based on Dark Horse Comics. These including The Mask and Hellboy. The company also produces novels based on some of their more popular comic book titles, including Aliens and Predator. ==Dark Horse titles== ===Original titles=== *300 *The American *Age of Reptiles *Agents of Law *ArchEnemies *Badger *Barb Wire *Battle Gods: Warriors of the Chaak *Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot *Billy the Kid's Old Timey Oddities *The Blackburne Covenant *Boris the Bear *BPRD *Catalyst: Agents of Change *Cheval Noir *Concrete *Cravan *Criminal Macabre *Cut *Damn Nation *The Dark Horse Book Of *Dark Horse Presents *The DeadlanderTalking to Kevin Ferrara about The Deadlander , Newsarama, October 3, 2007 *Dr. Giggles *El Zombo Fantasma *Freaks of the Heartland *Gary Gianni's The MonsterMen *Ghost *Girl Crazy *Give Me Liberty *The Goon *Grendel *The Hammer, Kelley Jones' *Hard Boiled *Haunted Man *Heartbreakers *Hellboy *Hero Zero *HyperSonic *Kingdom of the Wicked *Living With The Dead *Lords of Misrule *Marshal Law *The Mask *Maxwell Strangewell *Motorhead *Milkman Murders *Out of the Vortex *The Perhapanauts *Red Rocket 7 *Rex Mundi *Samurai: Heaven and Earth *Scarlet Traces *The Secret *Sin City *SpyBoy *The Thirteenth Son *The Umbrella Academy *Usagi Yojimbo *H.G.
