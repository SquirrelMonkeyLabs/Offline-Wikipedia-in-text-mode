 "text": "The Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) is a research program to investigate carbon deep in the Earth. It is a community of scientists (biologists, physicists, geoscientists and chemists) who develop this new field of deep carbon science. In December 2018, researchers announced that amounts of life forms are deep underground. They think 70% of bacteria and archaea on Earth (23 billion tonnes of carbon) live at least deep underground, including below the seabed.Amos, Jonathan. BBC News Science & Environment: Amount of deep life on Earth quantified. There is a ten-year Deep Carbon Observatory project.Deep Carbon Observatory (10 December 2018). \"Life in deep Earth totals 15 to 23 billion tons of carbon -- hundreds of times more than humans - Deep Carbon Observatory collaborators, exploring the 'Galapagos of the deep,' add to what's known, unknown, and unknowable about Earth's most pristine ecosystem\".
