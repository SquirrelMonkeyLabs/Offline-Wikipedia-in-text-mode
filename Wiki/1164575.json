 "text": "Exploding Kittens is a card game that is by The Oatmeal company in January 2015. The first test of the game was recorded on YouTube by Smosh Games, which had their first deck. ==How to play== All cards are placed in the deck, except for the Defuse and the Exploding Kitten cards. The deck is shuffled and each player gets seven cards in their hand including the Defuse card. The remaining Exploding Kitten and Defuse cards are shuffled back in the deck. Players are not allowed to show their cards to other players. Played cards (including played Defuse cards) are put into the discard pile. If a player draws an Exploding Kitten card, they must show it to everybody and they are out of the game unless if they have a Defuse card. The last player remaining in the game wins. ==Special cards== *Defuse Card: Saves them when they draw an Exploding Kitten's card. *Exploding Kitten Card: They are instantly out of the game unless if they have the Defuse card.
