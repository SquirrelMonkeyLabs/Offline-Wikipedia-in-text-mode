Current law says that when there is no U.S. Attorney in a district the Attorney General can appoint one for 120 days. == U.S. Attorney appointment controversy == There was an issue in 2006 where a law was passed which said the Attorney General could appoint a U.S. attorney to serve for as long as needed, which in a way went around the Senate confirmation process. The issue was fixed with a law passed in 2007. The Office of the United States Attorney was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789. ==References== Category:United States law Category:Law occupations",
