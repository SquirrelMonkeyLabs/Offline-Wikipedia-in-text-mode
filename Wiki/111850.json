 "text": "Nehemiah Curtis \"Skip\" James (June 9, 1902 â€“ October 3, 1969) was an American Delta blues singer, guitarist, pianist and songwriter. == Biography == === Early years === James was born near Bentonia, Mississippi. He worked on road construction in the early 1920s, and wrote his earliest song, \"Illinois Blues\", about his experience as a worker. He began playing guitar in open D-minor tuning with three fingers. === 1920s and '30s === Skip James traveled to Grafton, Wisconsin to record for Paramount. James recorded blues and spirituals and cover versions of other songs. The Great Depression happened just as James' records were put on the market. Not many people bought them because of this and James had to give up Blues music and worked in a church with his father. === After the depression=== For the next thirty years, James did not record any songs. In July 1964, James started playing again and he recorded for the Takoma, Melodeon, and Vanguard labels and played until his death in 1969. ==Discography== Paramount 78s: 1931 *Complete 1931 Session Yazoo, 1986 *Complete Recorded Works (1931) Document, 1990 *The Complete Early Recordings of Skip James - 1930 Yazoo, 1994 *Cypress Grove Blues Snapper Music Group, 2004 *Illinois Blues Universe, 2004 *The Complete 1931 Recordings Body & Soul, 2005 *Hard Time Killin' Floor Yazoo, 2005 After the depression: 1964-1969 *Greatest of the Delta Blues Singers Biograph, 1964 *She Lyin Adelphi, 1964 (first released: Genes, 1996) *Skip James Today!
