 "text": "A riot shield is a type of shield used by the police or military to protect themselves from objects thrown at them, such as stones, bricks, sticks, punches and kicks, etc. during a riot. Riot shields are typically long enough to cover an average-sized person from the top of the head to the knees, though smaller one-handed models may also be used. They are generally made of transparent polycarbonate, to allow the wearer to see the thrown objects. Law enforcement often use them in conjunction with a baton. Most riot shields do not offer ballistic protection. Category:Law enforcement equipment",
