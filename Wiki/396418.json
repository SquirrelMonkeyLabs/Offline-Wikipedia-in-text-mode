 "text": "The Eublepharinae are one of the five subfamilies of the Gekkonidae, or geckos. The Eublepharinae subfamily has 27 species in five genera. Also called eyelid geckos, the eublepharines have more simple features than other geckos. For example, they don't have the ability to climb surfaces. Unlike other geckos, they also have movable eyelids. They are generally active at night or at twilight. These lizards often eat insects and similar creatures. They lay a pair of leathery eggs, and, in most species, the gender of the young is determined by the temperature of the egg; just like crocodiles. The subfamily contains the following genera: *Coleonyx (seven species) *Eublepharis (five species) *Goniurosaurus (11 species) *Hemitheconyx (two species) *Holodactylus (two species) ==References== Category:Lizards",
