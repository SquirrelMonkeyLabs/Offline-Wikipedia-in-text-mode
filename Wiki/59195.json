Luffy's dream to find the One Piece, a grand treasure that the king of the Pirates, Gold D. Roger left behind. One Piece takes place in a world with one continent, many different islands, and a vast and large sea filled with monsters, pirates and treasure. One Piece is serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump. The most successful One Piece movies are One Piece Film: Red, One Piece Film: Z, and One Piece: Stampede. == Characters == * Monkey D. Luffy - the main character and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is also known as 'Straw Hat Luffy'. He ate a Devil Fruit called the \"Gomu- Gomu No Mi\" when he was 7 years old, giving him the ability to stretch like rubber. His Straw hat was given to him by Shanks. His older brothers are Ace and Sabo. * Roronoa Zoro - a former pirate hunter. He was the greatest warrior in his dojo, next to Kuina, the his teacher's daughter. They then make a promise to one another that one of them will be the greatest swordsman. The very next day Kuina dies. Zoro takes her sword so he can fulfill their dream. * Sanji - A martial artist and cook that falls in love with almost every girl he sees. His dream is to find 'The All Blue', a sea where ingredients from all over the world can be found, and as a cook he reveres his hands greatly. * Nami - A thief who stole from pirates and a member of the Arlong pirates. She is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates now. * Usopp - A sniper, coward and liar. Luffy officially made him the crew's sniper after he had perfect aim on his first try at shooting a cannon, destroying an island in one blow. * Tony Tony Chopper - A blue-nosed reindeer who ate a fruit which gave him the ability to become partly human. He is the doctor of the Straw Hats crew, and has a habit of \"hiding behind objects\" in a way where he is completely visible. * Nico Robin - A former member of the crime organization Baroque Works, joins the crew after being saved by Luffy. She ate the Hana-Hana no mi (Flower-Flower fruit) which lets her create replications of her body parts on any surface she wants, including living organisms. * Franky - A cyborg and a ship breaker. His body runs on Cola, although using other drinks results in a shift in personality like when he was given tea and became more wise. * Brook- A living skeleton who used to be a part of Gol D. Roger's crew. Brook ate the Yomi-Yomi no mi (Revive-Revive fruit) which allowed him a second life after his death as a skeleton. Brook gained full control over his powers which allows him to create a 'freezing aura' around his weapon. He is the ship's musician. * Jinbe-Formerly the leader of the Fishman Pirates and one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, he joined Luffy's crew at Marineford. He uses Fishman karate. == Stories == === Romance Dawn (The start of adventure) === Once upon a time, \"The King of Pirates\", Gol. D. Roger attained all things the world had to offer. As he was being executed by the Marines, he gave a speech regarding his treasure, which he left on an island in the Grand Line called the \"One Piece\". Many pirates wish to claim the ¨One Piece¨. This has caused what is called \"The Great Pirate Era\". Then, a boy living in Foosha Village, Monkey. D. Luffy, made friends with \"Red-Haired\" Shanks. Shanks is a powerful pirate, given the title of Yonko (Four Emperors, consisting of four of the strongest pirates) staying in the town. One day, Luffy ate a Devil Fruit that Shanks´ crew had stolen from a Marine ship, called the \"Gomu-Gomu no Mi\" (Gum Gum/Rubber Rubber fruit), giving him the ability to stretch like rubber, in exchange for taking away his ability to swim. At one point Luffy had gotten angry at some bandits for insulting Shanks and attacked them. The leader of the bandits was going to kill Luffy, but Shanks helped save him by defeating the bandits. This angered Higuma (the leader of the bandits) so he threw Luffy into the sea. Luffy was nearly eaten by a Sea King, a sea monster similar to a Sea Serpent, but Shanks helped him, losing his arm in the process. When Shanks left Foosha Village, he gave Luffy his straw hat. In exchange, Luffy had promised Shanks to become the King of the Pirates and deliver him his straw hat. === East Blue Saga === After 10 years of training, Luffy leaves his home, Foosha Village, to begin his journey to become the king of pirates. But soon, his boat got stuck in a whirlpool, and he jumped inside a barrel to survive. He eventually ends up at Alvida´s base where he meets Koby. Koby is a chore boy on Alvida´s crew. Koby's dream is to be a marine, but unfortunately, he is forced to stay on Alvida's crew in exchange for his life. Luffy ends up telling Koby that he would do anything to achieve his dream, and Koby is inspired. This gives Koby enough courage to stand up to Alvida with Luffy. Luffy ends up defeating Alvida and sails to Shell Town with him because it is the nearest Marine base. ==== Shell Town (part of East Blue saga) ==== In Shell Town, Luffy meets Roronoa Zoro, the legendary pirate hunter, who is tied to a post in a naval base. Zoro has been tied up for the crime of killing Helmeppo´s (The local captain´s son) dog because they were about to attack a little girl. Helmeppo promises Zoro if he can go after he is tied to the post for 30 days without food or water. However, Luffy overhears Helmeppo telling his Marine bodyguards that they´ll execute Zoro tomorrow and break his promise. Luffy becomes enraged over this and punches Helmeppo, who runs to go tell his father, Captain Axe-Hand Morgan to get him to beat Luffy up, but Captain Morgan is too busy raising a statue of himself on top of the base. Luffy accidentally breaks the statue, and Captain Morgan orders his guards to kill Luffy. Luffy grabs Helmeppo to find out where Zoro´s swords are located and Koby starts untying Zoro from the post; which gets him shot in the armpit by Captain Morgan. Zoro and Luffy join up to defeat Captain Morgan. All the Marines are happy because Captain Morgan was a tyrant. Koby asks Luffy if they can always be friends even though he´s joining the Marines, and Luffy promises to always be friends with Koby. Luffy ends up getting Zoro to join his crew, and they set sail. ==== Baratie ==== Luffy and Usopp are testing out the new cannons on their ship by firing at an island. Usopp destroys the island first try and Luffy makes him their sniper. They are then jumped by a bounty hunter named Yosaku because the island they destroyed was where he was resting. However Yosaku sees Zoro and stops attacking and calls him 'Big Bro', a title of friendship between them. Yosaku then explains his predicament that his bounty hunting partner is sick with a mysterious disease. == Movies == * ONE PIECE THE MOVIE episode of Chopper + Huyu ni saku, Kiseki no Sakura was released in 2008. * ONE PIECE FILM STRONG WORLD was released in 2010. * ONE PIECE FILM Z was released in 2012. * One Piece Gold was released in 2016. * One Piece Stampede which released in 2019. * And One Piece Red which released in 2022 == References == == Other websites == * Watch One Piece Episodes * One Piece Episodes Category:Anime",
