 "text": "Beaver Coins were gold coins made in Oregon in 1849. They were also known as Beaver Money. Their name comes from the beaver on the front of the coins. The currency contained 8% more gold than other coins from that same period of American history in the United States of America. Today these coins are rare and valuable. After the creation of the Territory of Oregon, the mint that made the coins became privately owned. It still made coins until Governor Joseph Lane said that this was unconstitutional in September 1849. Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution says that the mintage of coins is one of the powers of the Congress.) The opening of the United States Mint branch in San Francisco, California made many gold and silver U.S. currency available. This helped end the usage of the \"Beaver Coins\". ==References== Category:American coins",
