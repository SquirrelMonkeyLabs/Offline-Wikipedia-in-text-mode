 "text": "A Żubroń (/ˈʒuːbrɒnj/; Polish: żubroń [ˈʐubrɔɲ]) is a hybrid (mix) of a cow and a wisent. The wisent is another name for the European bison. That means a żubroń is a lot like a beefalo. The name żubroń was picked from a lot of choices. Before that, people sent the choices into a Polish magazine in 1969. == References == Category:Bovids Category:Domesticated animals Category:Animal hybrids",
