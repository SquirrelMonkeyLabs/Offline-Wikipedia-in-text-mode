 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Beto O'Rourke, the former U.S. Representative who represented Texas's 16th congressional district from 2013 to 2019, was announced on March 13, 2019. O'Rourke became known on the national stage running for Senate in Texas, challenging incumbent Ted Cruz. He narrowly lost, by a margin of less than three percent, in one of the tightest races that year. In late 2018, speculation began that O'Rourke might run in the 2020 United States presidential election. Before the midterm elections, The New Republic mentioned that O'Rourke's Senate campaign was to help lay the groundwork for a potential presidential bid, especially since he was likely to lose his Senate race. He ended his campaign on November 1, 2019. ==Endorsements== ==References== Category:2020 United States presidential campaigns",
