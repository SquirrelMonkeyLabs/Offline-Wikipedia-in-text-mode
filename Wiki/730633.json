Chafee unsuccessfully campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015. During his candidacy, Chafee criticized Hillary Clinton for her public support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and her use of a private email server. In 2019, following his move to the state of Wyoming, Chafee registered as a member of the Libertarian Party, which he announced through an op-ed. On January 5, 2020, Chafee filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a candidate committee for the 2020 United States presidential election. Chafee has said he plans on making a formal announcement about his candidacy on January 8, 2020.
