 "text": "Chenoa is a city in Illinois in the United States. The census tells us 1,695 people lived there in 2020. The city can be found where Interstate 55 meets Historic Route 66 and U.S. Route 24. Matthew T. Scott started the city in 1854 to give the people who rented homes on his farm the chance to shop and buy and sell with each other and so he could ship grain. The Chenoa Centennial was celebrated in 1954. Today, farming is still a big part of the community. Schuirman's Drug Store (now Chenoa Pharmacy) and Union Roofing are both notable because of how long they have been businesses in the area. Union Roofing is one of the largest roofers in Illinois. Many small shops and factories exist in the city too, including shops which sell antiques. The town school system closed at the end of the 2004 school year so now students go instead to the nearby Prairie Central school district. Lots of people enjoy July 4 celebrations in Chenoa each year. Category:Cities in Illinois",
