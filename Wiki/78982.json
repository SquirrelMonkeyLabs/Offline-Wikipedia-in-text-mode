 "text": "An internet meme is something famous on the internet such as an image, a video, or even a person. Internet memes are usually created when someone publishes something and that thing is shared widely over the Internet. They sometimes consist of an image with top and bottom text. While spreading over the internet, most internet memes 'evolve' over time, with the original image/video being changed in one way or another by people other than the creator. Every internet meme evolves and has many variants. Two other versions of Internet memes are \"dank memes\" and \"dead memes\". Dank memes are thought of as relevant and funny. Dead memes are thought of as old and forgotten, most of which haven't been used in months or years. Dead memes, however, can become dank memes if they are re-posted after their former dank status has been forgotten. Some websites where internet memes can be shared include Reddit, 4chan, 9gag, and IFunny. A popular chatting service where internet memes can be shared is Discord, an instant messaging and communication platform. Memes on Discord are shared through images, videos, and GIFs, although these methods aren't only limited to Discord. You can also go to Imgflip. == Types of memes == There are many different types of internet memes. They include the following types: === Impact meme === Memes that use an impact font.
