 "text": "The Battle of the Colline Gate was fought by Sulla and the Marians, Samnites, and Lucanians near Porta Collina. == Battle == Sulla's army was tired because they marched across a long distance. His officers and commanders asked for time to rest, but Sulla only gave them food and a few hours of rest before he got ready for battle. As the battle continued, Sulla's left wing commanded by Crassus was pushed back so far they reached the gates of Porta Collina. They tried to enter, but the defenders just closed it, forcing them to continue to fight. Eventually Sulla went to the left to try to regain control while Crassus went to the right wing, who successfully routed the enemy. Sulla motivated his men with this, and the battle went on till dark. Pontius Telesinus, the commander died, and Marcus Lamponius fled with his men. == Aftermath == Sulla killed those he captured and paraded their heads around a nearby besieged city where another enemy named Gaius Marius the Younger was being sieged. The people knew it was over, and Marius killed himself. This battle practically ended the Social War (91-87 BC)",
