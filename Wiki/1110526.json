 "text": "Constitution Day is the national day of Norway and is celebrated on 17 May every year. This day celebrates the Norwegian Constitution because it was signed on 17 May 1814 at Eidsvoll. In Norwegian, this day is sometimes called Syttende mai (Seventeenth of May), Nasjonaldagen (National Day), or Grunnlovsdagen (Constitution Day). On this day, people celebrate with big parades. They wear special clothes called bunad. People eat food like hot dogs, waffles, and ice cream. It is also common to see groups of people do the Bygdedans, a traditional dance. Children's parades are an important part of the celebrations. Schools organize these parades, and children walk with flags and banners. They often play music and sing songs. In the capital city, Oslo, it is tradition for the royal family to stand on the balcony of the Royal Palace. They wave to the crowds as the parade passes by. Many people travel to Oslo to see this special event. == Related pages == * Constitution of Norway == References == Category:Holidays Category:Norway",
