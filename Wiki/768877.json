 "text": "The Western Highland treefrog (Litoria iris) is a small frog from New Guinea. Male adult frogs are 36 mm long from nose to rear end and females are 43 mm long. Their backs can be any of a few colors but usually green with a thick black pattern. They have orange coloring on their legs and some purple and blue on their middles and bellies. They lay eggs on plants hanging over bodies of water. Tadpoles take two weeks to hatch and then fall off the leaf into the water. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
