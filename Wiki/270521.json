 "text": "Latin honours are Latin phrases that are used to show how advanced the level at which someone earned an academic degree. The common ranks are: (meaning \"with honor\"), (\"with great honor\"), or (\"with highest honor\"). This system is mostly used in Canada, the United States, and in many European countries. Some universities in other countries also use the English translation of these phrases rather than the Latin ones. Another example is , which means \"with outstanding honor\" in English. The rank was created to recognize students who earned the same grade point average as the honor, but who did so while in a more rigorous honors curriculum (used by the College of St. Benedict and St. John's University). ==Other websites== *Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus, concerning Latin honors ยง15, in German Category:Qualifications Category:Education Category:Latin phrases",
