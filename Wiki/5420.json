 "text": "Calvin Coolidge (born John Calvin Coolidge Jr.; July 4, 1872 - January 5, 1933) was the 30th president of the United States between 1923 and 1929. He was a conservative who supported business and lower taxes. == Family life == He was the only president of the United States to be born on July 4. He was married to Grace Coolidge and had 2 children: John Calvin Coolidge III (born September 6, 1906 - died May 31, 2000) and John Calvin Jr. (born April 13, 1908 - died July 7, 1924). His younger son John Calvin Coolidge IV died at 16 while playing tennis at the White House. His son was wearing tennis shoes without socks and died from a toe infection. He was buried at the foot of Hill Cemetery. After this, President Coolidge may have been depressed. == Political career == Coolidge served as the Mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts. He later served as the Governor of Massachusetts. As governor, he became famous because of his response during the Boston Police Strike. Coolidge fired the police who went on strike and gave the jobs to unemployed World War 1 veterans (he gave the same bonuses that the striking policemen asked for to the veterans). In 1920, he was nominated Vice President under Warren G. Harding. The Harding- Coolidge team won easily. Harding died in 1923 and Coolidge became the next president. He was inaugurated at his family farm in Vermont by his father John Calvin Coolidge Sr. Coolidge finished Harding's term and was elected in 1924 to continue to be the country's president. Coolidge was president during a prosperous economy and the country did not face many challenges. He believed that the federal government should be as small as possible. He supported tax cuts and wanted the federal government to not intervene in the economy. He was the first president to lead a public celebration of the Christmas holidays. Coolidge was criticized for refusing to give subsidies to farmers and when a giant flood happened in Mississippi during 1927, he did not want the federal government to be involved. This was part of his belief of federalism, that the country's problems should be solved mainly by state governments and local governments rather than the federal government. He did not run for re-election in 1928 and published his autobiography the following year. he died of a heart attack in Massachusetts at age 60 The legacy of Calvin Coolidge is mixed. People who support more federal government involvement in the economy do not like him. People who support less federal government involvement in the economy like him. == Silent Cal == Calvin Coolidge was nicknamed \"Silent Cal\" because he did not talk much. There is a story that at a dinner party, a woman once told Coolidge that she could get more than two words out of him, to which he replied \"You lose.\" ==Notes== == References == == Other websites == * Coolidge's White House biography Category:1872 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Deaths from coronary thrombosis Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:Governors of Massachusetts Category:Politicians from Vermont Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:Capitalism Category:Vice presidents of the United States Category:20th-century presidents of the United States",
