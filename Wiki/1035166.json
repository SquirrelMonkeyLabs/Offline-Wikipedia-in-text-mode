 "text": "Rosa Bonheur (18221899) was a French painter. She is known for detailed paintings of animals. Bonheur was born on 16 March 1822 in Bordeaux, France. Many people in her family were artists. Her father taught her to paint. At that time it was unusual for women to be painters. Bonheur became very good at painting images of animals and making sculptures of animals. She showed and sold her work at the Paris Salon. In 1852 began painting her best-known image The Horse Fair. The painting is called monumental because it is so large. It is around tall and wide. In 1865 Bonheur was given the cross of the Legion of Honour. Bonheur died on 25 May 1899 in Thomery, France. In 2022 the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux together with the Musée d'Orsay in Paris held a retrospective of Bonheur's work. The show was held on Bonheur's bicentenary (200th birthday). == Gallery == File:Rosa Bonheur - Ploughing in Nevers - Google Art Project.jpg|Rosa Bonheur, Ploughing in Nivernais, 1849 File:Rosa Bonheur, The Horse Fair, 1852–55.jpg|Rosa Bonheur, The Horse Fair, 1852–55 == References == Category:1822 births Category:1899 deaths Category:People from Bordeaux Category:French artists",
