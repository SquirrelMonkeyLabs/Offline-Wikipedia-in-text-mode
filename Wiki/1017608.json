 "text": "The brick-red bug-eyed frog (Theloderma lateriticum) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and China. This frog lives in evergreen forests on hills that have streams in them and places where water comes up out of the ground. People have seen this frog between 240 and 1400 meters above sea level. This frog's eggs are large. The female frog lays 6-8 eggs at a time. When the eggs hatch, they fall into the waterbelow. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. People do not see this frog, but it is there. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Hoang Lienâ€“Van Ban Proposed Nature Reserve, Ngoc Son-Ngo Loung and Ha Kia-Pa Co Nature Reserve, and Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve. People may build a dam for electricity in the forest where the frog lives. Scientists think this might hurt the frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
