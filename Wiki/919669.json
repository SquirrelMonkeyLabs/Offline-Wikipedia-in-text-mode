 "text": "A somatic symptom disorder is a mental condition in which a person has physical symptoms. ==Overview== Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder can hardly be explained by a medical condition or substance abuse. Symptoms include shortness of breath, pain and weakness. ==History== Before 2013, somatic symptom disorders were called somatoform disorders. ==Differential diagnosis== Symptoms can be similar to other conditions. They will sometimes last for years. ==Prevalence== Females report somatic problems almost ten times as often as males of the same or similar mental conditions. Symptoms often happen before age 50, but usual diagnoses are age 30 and earlier. The disorder is very controversial because some individuals say that the name refers to mental illness. ==References== Category:Health Category:Psychiatry Category:Psychology Category:Physiology Category:Controversies Category:Health problems Category:Anxiety disorders",
