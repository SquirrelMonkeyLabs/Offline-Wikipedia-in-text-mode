 "text": "The Pandipath bush frog (Raorchestes archeos) is a species of frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghats. People have seen it between 500 and 1071 meters above sea level. It lives in wet evergreen forests. People have seen it in the mountain ranges between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying out. This is because human beings continue to change the place where it lives, but it is good at living in places that humans have changed, so long as they haven't changed it too much. Scientists say chemicals meant to kill pests may also kill this frog. One of the places the frog lives is the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve. Every year, many people take a religious trip to the reserve. They leave behind garbage and take wood for firewood. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
