He was promoted to the rank of Captain on June 1, 1962.LTC Greg Johansen, U.S. Army, 'Strategic Leadership Assessment of Colin L.

In February 2003 he appeared before the United Nations Security Council. He presented evidence that Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This convinced many in the US that Iraq was a threat. In September 2004 he appeared before the United States Congress to testify that the intelligence used to show Iraq had WMDs was wrong. Then, on November 15, 2004, Powell announced his resignation. ==Later life== Powell supported Barack Obama for President of the United States in 2008 and 2012.
