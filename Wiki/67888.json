It can also refer to the business given by a regular customer, and the guardianship of saints. In some countries the term is often used to describe the corrupt use of state money and goods to benefit groups, families, ethnicities or races in exchange for votes. These patronage systems are different depending on the area in which they are practiced. The term comes from the Latin patronatus. ==Sources and other websites== *Johannes Baptist Sägmüller.
