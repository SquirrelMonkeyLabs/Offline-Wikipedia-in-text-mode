The Righteous came from many nations, religions and walks of life and the assistance took various forms, including hiding Jews in their homes or on their property, providing false papers/false identities, assisting Jews to escape to safety. It has been given to Oskar Schindler, Miep Gies, Irena Sendler, and Corrie ten Boom and many others for saving lives during the Holocaust. The Righteous Among the Nations Memorial Path is located in the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem. ==References== == Other websites == * Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem website",
