 "text": "Sutton Coldfield, officially the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, is a suburban town and civil parish located in the Borough of Birmingham in the county of the West Midlands, England. However, it used to be part of Warwickshire. It is about 7 miles (11 km) northeast of Birmingham city centre. The 2011 census revealed the parish has a population of 95,107 people. It is a very old town. There are still examples of Roman roads and old architecture. It is a royal town because King Henry VIII granted it a Charter of Incorporation and named it a royal town in 1528 due to the influence of Bishop Vesey who was born in Sutton Coldfield. He became Henry VIII's chaplain and then became Bishop of Exeter. Sutton Coldfield railway station is on the Cross-City Line. Passengers can get direct trains to Birmingham, Redditch and Bromsgrove. ==Gallery== File:Lichfield_Road,_Sutton_Coldfield.jpg|Lichfield Road File:Sutton_town_centre.jpg|Gracechurch Shopping Centre File:War_Memorial_- _King_Edward_Square,_Sutton_Coldfield_- _Royal_Sutton_Place_and_Sutton_Coldfield_Town_Hall_(32438815896).jpg|King Edward Square File:Sutton_Coldfield_Town_Hall.jpg|Sutton Coldfield Town Hall File:Midland_Drive_luxury_apartments,_Sutton_Coldfield.jpg|Midland Drive Category:Birmingham Category:Civil parishes in England Category:Royal Towns in the United Kingdom Category:Towns in the West Midlands (county)",
