They appear in the main segments of the show. The Warner siblings are said to be old cartoon characters who were locked in a water tower, where they live. They usually introduce themselves as \"the Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister)\". • Yakko Warner is tallest and the oldest siblings of the Warners. He often talks quickly, and tells most of the show's innuendo jokes. • Wakko Warner is the middle sibling of the Warners. He has a large appetite, and usually performs body humor, such as burping. • Dot Warner is the youngest sibling of the Warners. She gives a graceful impression, but can be comically energetic like her brothers. === Pinky and the Brain === \"Pinky and the Brain\" segments are about a pair of genetically spliced mice who are trying to take over the world. This segment was later made into a spin-off series, also named Pinky and the Brain. • Pinky is one of the two central characters in Pinky and the Brain segments. He is good-natured and simple-minded, but he is loyal to the Brain. • Brain is one of the two central characters in Pinky and the Brain segments. He is very intent on his plans of taking over the world. Brain is the one who often comes up with complex ideas to try to do so. === The Goodfeathers === \"The Goodfeathers\" segments are about a trio of pigeons whose behavior is inspired by Goodfellas. * Squit is the pigeon whose good-intentioned actions usually offend Pesto. * Bobby is the pigeon who is usually silent, but laughs when Pesto and Squit fight. * Pesto is the short-tempered pigeon who often starts fights with Squit. === Slappy and Skippy === \"Slappy and Skippy\" segments are about two squirrels who often try to outsmart their enemies using classic cartoon slapstick gags. * Slappy Squirrel is said to be a veteran character who appeared in old cartoons. She is often grumpy, but knows many slapstick tricks from when she starred in cartoons. * Skippy Squirrel is Slappy's nephew. Unlike Slappy, he is cheerful. He is often a partner in Slappy's cartoon gag acts. == Reboot series == A reboot of the series was announced by Hulu in January 2018. It aired starting in 2020, bearing the name Animaniacs. ==References== ==Other websites== * * The official DVD website * Animaniacs at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.
