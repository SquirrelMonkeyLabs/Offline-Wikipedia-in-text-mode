 "text": "Pleuropholidae, the pleuropholids, is an extinct family of stem-teleost fish that lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. It is one of the few families that were formerly placed in the paraphyletic order Pholidophoriformes. Pleuropholids can be distinguished from other pholidophoriforms by the elongated scales on the sides of their bodies. == Some genera == === Pleuropholis === Pleuropholis is an extinct, prehistoric pleuropholid with fossils found in Europe and North America. The type species is Pleuropholis crassicauda. === Parapleuropholis === Parapleuropholis is an extinct ray-finned fish from the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the early Toarcian stage of the Early Jurassic. == Taxonomy == The family has five genera: * Austropleuropholis * Gondwanapleuropholis * Parapleuropholis * Pleuropholis * Zurupleuropholis == Related pages == * Acanthomorpha * Acanthopterygii * Pleuropholis * Triggerfish == References == # Brito, P.
