 "text": "Treponema pallidum is a parasitic spirochaete bacterium. There are different kinds of Treponema pallidum, which cause diseases like syphilis, bejel, pinta and yaws. The most common disease caused by Treponema pallidum is syphilis, a serious sexually transmitted infection. Syphilis is treated and cured by taking antibiotics. Usually, the first treatment used is penicillin. Antibiotic resistance has developed to a number of agents.Stamm L.V. 2010. Global challenge of antibiotic-resistant Treponema pallidum. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 54 (2): 583–9. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, may be as effective as penicillin-based treatment.Kent M.E. & Romanelli F. 2008. Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management. Ann Pharmacother 42 (2): 226–36. Pennicilin is still effective, but \"the potential of this spirochete to develop additional antibiotic resistance could seriously compromise syphilis treatment and control\". == References == Category:Gram- negative bacteria",
