 "text": "Meitei people (), also known as the Manipuris (), originally from northeastern India (mostly from Manipur) and parts of Bangladesh with Meitei populations, are a small but emerging community in the United States. As part of the broader South Asian diaspora, the Meiteis have gradually settled in various parts of the country, often driven by opportunities for education, work, and a better quality of life. While the community is still relatively small, they have begun to establish themselves within the multicultural fabric of American society. Through their migration, the Meitei people maintain a sense of connection to their cultural traditions, while also adapting to their new environment, contributing to the diverse and dynamic nature of life in the United States. == Migration == Manipuri migration from India to the United States began in the late 1960s. This migration primarily involved students and skilled professionals and is categorized as part of the \"new diaspora.\" Over time, the Manipuri diaspora established communities in several states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and California.Routledge Handbook of Asian Diaspora and Development. United Kingdom: Taylor & Francis, 2021. p. 107-121 === Waves of Migration === The migration occurred in successive phases: * First Wave (1960s–1970s): This phase consisted of a small number of students and professionals who moved to the United States for education and employment. Some returned to Manipur after completing their studies. * Second Wave (1980s–1990s): During this period, additional migrants from Manipur arrived in the United States. Their migration paralleled the broader movement of Indian professionals, particularly in information technology, who entered the United States on temporary work visas such as the H-1B. Migrants from Manipur during this wave included engineers, doctors, scientists, nurses, educators, theologians, entrepreneurs, and students. * Third Wave (2000s-2020s): The third wave of migration from Manipur to the United States began in the early 2000s, with the Manipuri population increasing to over 100 individuals. By 2016, the population had grown to approximately 300, and by 2020, it reached around 1,000. == Geographical distribution == The Meitei people, also known as the Manipuris, live in different places of USA, including Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, Texas, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida. == Cuisines == Meitei cuisines in the United States refer to ethnic food and beverages prepared by members of the Meitei diaspora. Commonly included dishes are Ooti, Eromba (), Hawaichar, Nga-thongba, traditional cheese, and Hawai. These cuisines are typically maintained within domestic spaces and community gatherings, reflecting the culinary practices of the Meitei community. Soibum (bamboo shoots), ngari (fermented fish) and hawaizar (fermented soya beans), are also notably used. == Dance and music == A Manipuri dance () recital was held at the Indo-American Arts Council in New York on 17th August 2011. The performance featured traditional Manipuri dance forms, representing the Meitei cultural heritage of the Indian state of Manipur. The event was part of the Council's efforts to promote Indian art and culture in the United States. Leima Jagoi () and Thabal Chongba () are traditional Meitei dance forms, notably performed by members of the American Meitei community during their meetings and summits. The performances serve as cultural expressions and are often included as parts of community gatherings and events. == Festivals == American Meitei people observe several traditional Meitei festivals, including Ningol Chakouba (), Yaoshang (), Kang (), Cheiraoba (), and Christmas. == Media == Kebola Wahengbam (), based in Cincinnati, launched a YouTube channel dedicated to traditional Meitei cuisine, cooking, and gardening. She is one of the first American Manipuri women to establish a YouTube presence. Her channel occasionally features traditional Meitei attire and dance. == Literature == Second-generation and third-generation members of the diaspora may have limited proficiency in Meiteilon (Manipuri language) and are typically more comfortable with English. On July 25, 2006, Laishram Sadananda, a retired Professor of Meitei literature (Manipuri literature), delivered a presentation titled \"What is Manipuri Literature: An Overview of the Language and Literature of Manipur\" at the New York Public Library. The event was organized by Dr. John M. Lundquist, Chief Librarian of the Asian and Middle Eastern Division, in collaboration with L. Somi Roy, a Manipuri-American media arts curator. This lecture marked the first presentation on Meitei literature outside of India. L. Somi Roy introduced the event by discussing the digitizeMANIPUR! project, which he initiated with support from the Richard Gilder Foundation and Educate LLC. Professor Sadananda's presentation included a detailed overview of both early and modern Meitei literature, emphasizing the language's Tibeto-Burman origins, its spread beyond Manipur, and the key categories of its literary works. He also provided examples of prominent texts and writers in modern Meitei literature. Additionally, he discussed the role of literary associations, publishing houses, and the academic teaching of Meitei literature, offering a comprehensive view of the literary landscape in Manipur. == Religion == The majority of Meitei people in the United States follow Hindu Vaishnavism, while some adhere to Sanamahism, an indigenous religion characterized by ancestor worship. == Remittances == In mid-June 2020, the North American Manipur Association (NAMA) donated INR 1,87,150 to the Chief Minister's COVID-19 Relief Fund and to two orphanages in Manipur. In July 2023, the Association of Meiteis in the Americas (AMA) donated essential commodities worth INR 16,50,000 to 36 relief camps across various districts in Manipur, with contributions from over 300 donors. In August 2023, the North American Manipur Association (NAMA) raised INR 6,00,000 through a fundraising campaign for relief efforts in Manipur. The funds were donated to the Manipur Governor’s relief fund to support displaced individuals in relief camps across the state. NAMA requested that the funds be used, either in whole or in part, to provide medical and sanitary assistance to women and children in the camps. == Social services == During the COVID-19 pandemic, American Meitei medical professionals used their stitching skills to produce hundreds of facemasks, which were donated to various healthcare and community centers, including Shattuck Hospital, Billerica Food Care, Franklin Senior Center, Beth Israel Hospital, Hockomock Area YMCA, the New Jersey State Adult Care Center, and New York State, as well as to friends, family, and other communities. == Sports == The North American Manipur Association (NAMA) seeks to preserve Meitei heritage by promoting the indigenous Meitei game of Kang (), which is nearly extinct. It does not, however, focus on the traditional Meitei form of polo (Sagol Kangjei), an indigenous game from Manipur that has gained international recognition. == Victims == Jupiter Yambem was a Manipuri individual residing in the United States and was the only known Manipuri working at the World Trade Center during the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. He departed for work early that morning, following his usual routine. The last known communication with him was a phone call from his wife, Nancy. In the aftermath of the attacks, once phone lines were partially restored, calls to his mobile phone would ring but went unanswered. Concern grew among his immediate family—his wife Nancy, son Shanti, and relatives in Imphal—as well as within the broader Manipuri community in the United States and elsewhere. On September 16, 2001, five days after the collapse of the World Trade Center, his remains were recovered from the debris and identified by his wife. A 25-year-old man originated from Manipur named Shaolin Chandam was shot on August 25, 2015, by a 24-year-old American named Keenan A. Palmer from Hampton. == Associations and organizations == The North American Manipuri Association (NAMA) was founded in 1991 in Brooklyn, New York, with no political ties or agenda. The Association of Meiteis in the Americas (AMA) is a group of Meitei individuals across the Americas, focused on community and cultural engagement. The North American Bangladesh Manipuri Society is a civil society organization with hundreds of Meitei members, mostly based in New York. The organization has participated in demonstrations urging the government to address \"illegal immigration\" in Manipur and to safeguard the state's territorial integrity. == Related pages == * Meitei people in Bangladesh * Meitei people in Canada * Meitei people in Myanmar * Meitei people in Assam * Meitei people in Meghalaya * Meitei people in Nagaland * Meitei people in Tripura == References == Category:United States Category:American people Category:Migration Category:Meitei people",
