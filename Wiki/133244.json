 "text": "Luís Filipe Madeira Caeiro Figo OIH (born 4 November 1972) is a former Portuguese football player. He had played for Portugal national team and last played for Inter Milan. In July 2000, Figo moved from Barcelona to their rivals Real Madrid for €62 million which was a world record fee at the time. This made Barcelona fans angry and they felt that he had betrayed them. When he played his first game back at Camp Nou, Barcelona fans hung banners with words like \"Judas\" and \"traitor\", shouted insults and threw objects at him including a pig's head. ==Career statistics== ===Club career=== Club League Season League Cup Europe Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Sporting CP Primeira Liga 1989–90 3 0 — — 3 0 1990–91 3 0 — — 3 0 1991–92 34 1 7 0 2 0 43 1 1992–93 32 0 8 1 2 0 42 1 1993–94 31 8 1 0 3 0 35 8 1994–95 34 7 7 3 2 0 43 10 Total 137 16 23 4 9 0 169 20 Barcelona La Liga 1995–96 35 5 8 1 10 3 53 9 1996–97 36 4 9 2 8 1 53 7 1997–98 35 5 4 0 7 1 46 6 1998–99 34 7 10 1 6 1 50 9 1999–2000 32 9 2 0 13 5 47 14 Total 172 30 33 4 44 11 249 45 Real Madrid 2000–01 34 9 1 0 14 5 49 14 2001–02 28 7 6 1 10 3 44 11 2002–03 33 10 1 0 15 2 48 12 2003–04 36 9 8 3 11 1 55 13 2004–05 33 3 0 0 10 4 43 7 Total 164 38 16 4 60 15 239 57 Inter Milan Serie A 2005–06 34 5 2 0 8 1 45 6 2006–07 32 2 7 1 7 0 47 3 2007–08 17 1 2 0 3 0 21 1 2008–09 22 1 — 3 0 25 1 Total 105 9 11 1 21 1 138 11 Career total Career total Career total 577 93 83 13 134 27 795 133 ===International=== Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Portugal 1991 3 0 1992 7 1 1993 5 0 1994 5 2 1995 6 1 1996 9 2 1997 7 2 1998 6 0 1999 9 4 2000 13 6 2001 9 9 2002 10 0 2003 10 3 2004 11 1 2005 7 0 2006 10 1 Total 127 32 :Scores and results list Portugal's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Figo goal.
