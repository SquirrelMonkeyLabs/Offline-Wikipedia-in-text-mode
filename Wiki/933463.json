 "text": "Initiative for RECOM (Albanian: Nisma për KOMRA; Bosnian/ Croatian: Inicijativa za REKOM; English: Initiative for RECOM; Macedonian/ Serbian: Иницијатива за РЕКОМ; Slovenian: Pobuda za REKOM), full name Initiative for the establishment of a Regional Commission tasked with establishing the facts about all victims of war crimes and other serious human rights violations committed on the territory of the former SFR Yugoslavia in the period from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2001, was an initiative to establish a regional commission for truth by agreement between the states of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Initiative for RECOM is represented in public through the RECOM Reconciliation Network (until 2019, Coalition for RECOM), which is the largest network of non-governmental organizations (more than 2,200 members) in the countries of the former SFR Yugoslavia. In 2019, RECOM Reconciliation Network gave up further insistence on the successor states of the SFRY to establish an intergovernmental commission. On that occasion, it took care and responsibility to make a list of victims of the wars caused by the disintegration of SFR Yugoslavia. The coordinator of the RECOM Reconciliation Network is Nataša Kandić. == References == ==Other websites== * RECOM Reconciliation Network * Category:Human rights",
