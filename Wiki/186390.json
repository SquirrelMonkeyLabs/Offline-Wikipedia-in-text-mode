 "text": "Club Penguin was a free-to-play multiplayer online game that was available to play online. It was owned by The Walt Disney Company starting in October 2005 before it was shut down in late March 2017. Club Penguin started as a chat room called Penguin Chat by Rocketsnail Games. The game was replaced by a freemium mobile application called Club Penguin Island, which did not receive the success that the original online game had. ==Gameplay== Club Penguin was an online virtual world for all ages, where players could talk and meet with each other. Parties were held once a month with a different theme every time. Players could play games to earn coins. There were also several rooms in Club Penguin. A player would usually land in the town whenever they logged on. All players gathered at the town. By walking or by using the map, players could visit other places. ==Shutdown== Before shutdown, it was announced that on the final day of Club Penguin, everybody would get membership. Club Penguin was shut down at 00:01:39 PM. A message appeared on screen for all players, saying \"The connection has been lost. Thank you for playing Club Penguin. Waddle on!\" ==Membership== Like most online games, Club Penguin had a membership which could be purchased online or through a gift card that was purchased from a store. As a member, players could buy new furniture, adopt more puffles, and get access to bonuses. ==Puffles== Puffles were the virtual pets. Non-members could buy a red puffle and a blue puffle, but members could adopt all 20 puffles in exclusive colors. A puffle that was not well cared for by its owner would leave its owner and return to the wild. Puffles had food, hats, and toys which could be bought in the game. ==Minigames== There were many games on Club Penguin, all with different controls. Some games are controlled by the computermouse, while other games were controlled by the keyboard. At the end of a game, the player earns a certain amount of coins, depending on how well the game was played. == Console games == There are some console video games based on Club Penguin. These include the following: * Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force * Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force: Herbert's Revenge for Nintendo DS * Club Penguin: Game Day for Wii == References == == Other websites == *Club Penguin website *Club Penguin Wiki *Club Penguin Wikia Category:2005 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Browser games Category:Disney video games Category:Flash games Category:IOS games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Miniclip games Category:Webby Award winners",
