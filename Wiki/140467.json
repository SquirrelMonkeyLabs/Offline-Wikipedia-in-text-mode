 "text": "An analog-to-digital converter (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic integrated circuit that converts a continuous quantity to a discrete time digital number. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement. The reverse operation is performed by a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Typically, an ADC is an electronic device that converts an input analog voltage or current to a digital number. The size of the number grows with an increase in the input voltage or current. However, some non-electronic or only partially electronic devices, such as rotary encoders, can also be considered ADCs. == References == * * * * * * * * * * ==More websites== * Counting Type ADC A simple tutorial showing how to build your first ADC. * An Introduction to Delta Sigma Converters A very nice overview of Delta-Sigma converter theory. * Digital Dynamic Analysis of A/D Conversion Systems through Evaluation Software based on FFT/DFT Analysis RF Expo East, 1987 * Which ADC Architecture Is Right for Your Application? article by Walt Kester * AN71 - The Care and Feeding of High Performance ADCs Real world circuit and layout advice * ADC and DAC Glossary Defines commonly used technical terms. * Signal processing and system aspects of time-interleaved ADCs. * Introduction to ADC in AVR - Analog to digital conversion with Atmel microcontrollers Category:Electronic circuits",
