 "text": "A direct election is an election in which people vote directly for the person, persons or political party that they want to see elected to a political position. The electorate casts their votes directly in an election for candidates of their choice that will represent them either in the executive or legislature without any problem. The opposite is an indirect election, in which the voters elect a group of people who in turn elects the officeholder in question. Many countries use a mixed system, where some elements are directly elected, and some are not.For example, India where the president is elected indirectly whereas the prime ministr is elected directly Lok Sabha are known as Members of parliament or members of lok sabha. Under the existing political system elections are held on party lines. The party or the combination of parties having the largest number of legislators elect their leader from amongst themselves, who is made the Chief Minister or the Prime Minister as the case may be. ==References== Category:Types of elections",
