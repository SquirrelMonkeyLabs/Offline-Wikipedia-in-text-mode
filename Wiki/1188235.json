 "text": "The 1937-38 Austrian football championship was organized by the National League Committee and contested by its members. In addition to the single-tier First League, several regional championships of the Austrian state associations served as the foundation for the National League. The Austrian championship season was overshadowed in its final days by the annexation of Austria by the Nazi-Germany on 12 March 1938. After the championship ended, it was taken over by the Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen. Professionalism was abolished on 22 April 1938. The National League championship was contested by ten teams, each of which met twice throughout the season. Rapid Wien won their 12th championship title. The last four teams were relegated. Two other teams were added to the two teams relegated for sporting reasons. This was decided on 9J uly 1938, long after the end of the championship. ==Final table== Table mode (in case of equal points): 1st criterion goal quotient Pl. Name M W D L P 1\\.
