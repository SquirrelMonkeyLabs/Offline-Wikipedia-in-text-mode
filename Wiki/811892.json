PATH trains run around the clock year around; four routes serving 13 stations operate during the daytime on weekends while two routes operate during weekends, late nights, and holidays. Its tracks cross the Hudson River through century old cast iron tubes that rests on the river bottom under a thin layer of silt. It operates as a deep level subway in Manhattan and the Jersey City/Hoboken riverfront; from Grove Street in Jersey City to Newark, trains run in open cuts, at grade level, and on elevated track.
