 "text": "The name Abbey [ ab-ee ] has become more popular recently and can be used for both boys and girls. It is a short form of Abigail, a Hebrew name that means \"my father's joy.\" However, Abbey also has its own unique meaning and history. Abbey comes from the Latin word \"abbeia,\" which means \"abbey\" or \"monastery.\" In the Middle Ages, an abbey was a place where monks or nuns lived and prayed. It was a peaceful and calm place where people could find comfort and spiritual advice. Therefore, the name Abbey suggests feelings of spirituality, calmness, and tranquility. This is a unique name (not in the top 1000 newborn names in the US in 2021). == People == * Abbey Simon, American musician ==References== Category:Names",
