 "text": "Swordsmanship refers to the skills of a swordsman. It is a modern term mainly used to refer to small sword fencing. But it can also be applied to any martial art involving the use of a sword. The English word \"swordsman\" is parallel to the Latin word gladiator.Douglas Harper, Etymology Online (2014), accessed 3 August 2014 This was a professional fighter who fought against other fighters and others for the entertainment of spectators in the Roman Colosseum. The word gladiator itself comes from the Latin word gladius, meaning \"sword\". ==Noted swordsmen == Japan's greatest swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi won sixty duels.Nick Evangelista, The Encyclopedia of the Sword (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995), p. 318 His classic book on swordsmanship is called the Book of Five Rings, written about 1645.
