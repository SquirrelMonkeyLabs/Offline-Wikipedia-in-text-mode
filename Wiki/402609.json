Chem. 280, 46. free fulltext He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1979.Arthur Kornberg, biochemist, dies at 89. The New York Times. His primary research interests were in biochemistry, especially enzyme chemistry, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis (DNA replication) and studying the nucleic acids which control heredity in animals, plants, bacteria and viruses. He is of Jewish descent. Arthur and Sylvy Kornberg had three sons: Roger Kornberg (1947), Thomas Kornberg (1948), and Kenneth Kornberg (1950). Roger is Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford University, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 2006. Thomas discovered DNA polymerase II and III in 1970 and is now a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Kenneth is an architect specializing in the design of biomedical and biotechnology laboratories and buildings. ==Books== *1961. Enzymatic synthesis of DNA. John Wiley & Sons, 1961 *1974.
