 "text": "Breton ( in Breton) is a Celtic language that is spoken in Brittany, in the north-west of France. Breton is closely related to Welsh, which is spoken in Wales, and to Cornish, which is spoken in Cornwall, in south-western Great Britain. All of them are Brythonic languages. Breton is less closely related to the Goidelic languages of Scottish Gaelic, which is spoken in Scotland; Irish, which is spoken in Ireland; and Manx, which is spoken on the Isle of Man. Breton has about 240,000 speakers,111 but that number is falling very quickly because the French government has a policy of using French. As such, Breton is considered to be an endangered language. ==Example== Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Breton: English: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. ==References== Category:Celtic languages Category:Languages of France",
