They were an important part of the grunge (or \"Seattle sound\") movement of the early 1990s, along with bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, and Alice in Chains. Pearl Jam has sold around 85 million records worldwide in 2018 and are usually named one of the greatest bands of the 90's. After fellow Seattle band Mother Love Bone's lead singer, Andrew Wood, died in 1990, remaining members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament went to look for a singer and a drummer for a new band. They came across Jack Irons which he soon passed on to Eddie Vedder, who worked at a gas station in California and occasionally surfed. He then recorded vocals for the songs \"Alive\", \"Once\", and \"Footsteps\". After he sent the demo to the members, Eddie flew to Seattle and joined the band. The band is made up of lead singer Eddie Vedder, guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, bassist Jeff Ament, and drummer Matt Cameron. Along with keyboardist Boom Gaspar and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer as touring members. The band had five drummers, which were Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, Dave Abbruzzese, and Jack Irons. Matt Cameron has been Pearl Jam's drummer since 1998. ==List of albums== ===Studio albums=== * 1991 - Ten * 1993 - Vs. * 1994 - Vitalogy * 1996 - No Code * 1998 - Yield * 2000 - Binaural * 2002 - Riot Act *2006 - Pearl Jam * 2009 - Backspacer * 2013 - Lightning Bolt *2020 - Gigaton *2024 - Dark Matter ===Compilation albums=== * 2003 - Lost Dogs * 2004 - Rearviewmirror: Greatest Hits 1991-2003 * 2011 - Pearl Jam Twenty ===Live albums=== * 1998 - Live on Two Legs * 2004 - Live at Benaroya Hall * 2006 - Live in NYC 12/31/92 * 2006 - Live at Easy Street * 2007 - Live at the Gorge 05/06 * 2007 - Live at Lollapalooza 2007 * 2011 - Live on Ten Legs * 2011 - 9.11.2011 Toronto, Canada * 2011 - Vault #1 Moore Theatre 1992 * 2012 - Vault #2 Vic Theatre, Chicago 2007 * 2013 - Vault #3 Constitution Hall, Washington D.C. 9/19/1998 * 2015 - Vault #4 Mount Baker Theatre, Bellingham, WA 5/10/2000 * 2015 - Vault #5 Alladin Theatre, Las Vegas 11/30/1993 * 2016 - Vault #6 Great Western Forum 7/13/1998 * 2016 - Live at Third Man Records * 2017 - Let's Play Two * 2023 - Give Way Category:1990 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Washington (state) Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American alternative rock bands Category:American hard rock bands Category:Grunge bands Category:Musical groups from Seattle Category:Musical groups established in 1990",
