 "text": "Dr. Samuel James \"Sam\" Loomis (March 13, 1922 - c. October 29th, 1998) is an fictional British character in the Halloween. He is one of the main protagonists of Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Donald Pleasence plays the character of Dr. Loomis in all five movies relating to Michael Michael Myers from parts 1-2 and from parts 4-6 (He and Michael did not appear in part 3). From all the Halloween franchise, he is thought to be as the archenemy to the series' central character and main villain, Michael Myers. Dr. Loomis does not appear in the other movies after part six, because his portrayer Donald Pleasence died before part six was released. Malcolm McDowell plays Dr. Loomis in the 2007 re-make, Halloween and in its sequel Halloween II. His name Samuel Loomis is based on John Gavin's character name from Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror movie Psycho. ==References== Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1978 Category:Halloween (franchise) Category:Movie characters Category:Horror movie characters",
