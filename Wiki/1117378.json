 "text": "Ghost words are a phenomenon in the study of linguistics and lexicography. These are words that have made their way into dictionaries and other language records by mistake. Unlike regular words, which have meanings and usages, ghost words lack a genuine linguistic origin and are often the result of errors such as misprints, misinterpretations, or typographical mistakes.
