 "text": "Saadani National Park is a unique national park located along the Indian Ocean coastline in Tanzania, known for its rare blend of coastal and terrestrial ecosystems. Covering an area of approximately 1,100 square kilometers, Saadani is Tanzaniaâ€™s only national park that borders the ocean, offering a combination of traditional safari experiences and beach activities. == Geography == Saadani National Park spans both the Pwani Region and the Tanga Region, positioned north of Dar es Salaam and southwest of Tanga. The park includes a mix of landscapes, such as savannah, mangrove swamps, and riverine environments along the Wami River, which flows through the park. This diversity creates unique habitats for both terrestrial and marine wildlife. == History == The area that is now Saadani National Park was initially a game reserve established in the 1960s. Due to its unique location and ecological significance, it was upgraded to a national park in 2005 by the Tanzanian government. The establishment of Saadani National Park aimed to preserve its unique ecosystems and promote sustainable tourism, providing visitors with the opportunity to experience both the savannah and the coast. == See Also == * List of national parks in Tanzania * Pwani Region * Wami River == References == == Other websites == * Official website of Tanzania National Parks * Tanzania Tourism Official Portal Category:National parks in Africa Category:Geography of Tanzania",
