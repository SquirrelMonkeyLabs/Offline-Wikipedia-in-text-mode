 "text": "A period 7 element is an element in the seventh period (row) of the periodic table. It contains 32 elements, beginning at francium and ending with oganesson. The Actinides are part of this period. They are all really radioactive. As of 2016, period 7 elements are the last period of elements that have been made. Period 7 elements have electrons in the first seven electron shells. All period 7 elements have one or more electrons in the seventh electron shell (valence electrons). When atomic number increases by one, another electron is added. Two electrons join the 7s orbital, 14 electrons join the 5f orbital, ten electrons join the 6d orbital, and six electrons join the 7p orbitals. ==References== Category:Periodic table",
