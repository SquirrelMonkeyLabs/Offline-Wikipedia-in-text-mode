 "text": "The Fritzl case began in 2008, when a woman named Elisabeth Fritzl (born 6 April 1966) informed investigators in the city of Amstetten, Lower Austria that she had been held captive for 24 years by her father, Josef Fritzl (born 9 April 1935). Fritzl had assaulted, sexually abused, and raped her many times when keeping her trapped in the family's basement. The abuse by Elisabeth's father resulted in the birth of seven children. Josef was arrested on suspicion of false imprisonment, rape, manslaughter by negligence, and incest. In March 2009, he pleaded guilty to all counts and was sentenced to life imprisonment. ==References== Category:2008 in Europe Category:Rape Category:Child sexual abuse Category:Incest Category:Trials",
