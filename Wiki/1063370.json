 "text": "Most countries have a system of honouring people. Most of them are based on the historical systems of nobility. In the past rulers would reward people by giving them land and titles. They could be punished by taking them away. Honours are very commonly used in the military where people are often given medals to recognise bravery. Scouting has a complex system of honours. Honours systems are generally heirarchical. Some honors are more important than others. ==References==",
