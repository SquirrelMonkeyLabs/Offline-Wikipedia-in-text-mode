 "text": "Suzanne Amador Kane is an American physicist and a professor at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. She is known for using physics to study how animals move and behave. Her research has helped scientists learn more about birds like falcons and peacocks. Her work also helps engineers design better robot swarms. Kane won an award from the American Physical Society in 2020. She is also the author of a book called Introduction to Physics in Modern Medicine.Gonzalez-Espada, W. (2009). College Students’ Opinions of Engaging Approaches in a Physical Science Course. Journal of College Science Teaching, 38(5), 22–27. http://www.jstor.org/stable/42993978 Kane combines studies of zoology and physics. She taught her students in this way too. She studied many different animals and birds. Kane was the lead author on an important study about falcons. Another study included peacocks. This groundbreaking study showed that peacock feathers and crests were more than just decoration. The crests were actually sensors. The study showed that peacock feathers are tuned to vibrate at the exact same frequencies as at which a displaying peacock is rattling his tail. This also inspired her to do more research on other birds. Kane taught at Haverford College in Pennsylvania and received the prestigious American Physical Society award for her teaching. She wrote the famous book “Introduction to physics in modern medicine.” == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2025",
