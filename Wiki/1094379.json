 "text": "Kurixalus wangi is a frog. It lives in Taiwan, in Pingtung County. People have seen it as high as 500 meters above sea level. Scientists only know a little information about this frog. Scientists have seen this frog on woody plants smaller than trees in forests that were cut down and are growing back. This frog lays eggs in holes in trees. The tadpoles swim in water in these holes. The tadpoles eat eggs that the female frog leaves in the water for them to eat. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Kurixalus eiffingeri, but they changed their minds after looking closely at the frogs' DNA. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
