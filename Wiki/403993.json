 "text": "The Blohm & Voss Bv 142 was a German reconnaissance aircraft of World War II. Its maiden flight was in October 1938. It was built at the beginning like an airliner. But just one was used by Lufthansa. The others were used by Luftwaffe for far reconnaissance. Fragile and unwieldy, it was stopped in 1942, just two years after it commissioned. Only four examples were built. == Bibliography == * Category:World War II German aircraft Category:Military of Germany Category:German military aircraft",
