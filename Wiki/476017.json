 "text": "Cookie Clicker is a JavaScript-based incremental game made by French programmer Julien Thiennot. The point of the game is to bake cookies as fast as possible. To start the game, a player burns cookies by clicking on a giant cookie. One cookie is gained each time it is clicked. With sufficient cookies to use as currency, a player can buy buildings like cookie farms and cookie mines and upgrades that will bake more cookies. They will also increase the number of cookies per click. There is no true end to the game. ==References== Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Browser games Category:Free online games Category:Incremental games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about food and drink",
