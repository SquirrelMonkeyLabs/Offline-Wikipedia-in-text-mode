 "text": "Rupert Everett (Rupert James Hector Everett, born 29 May 1959) is an English actor, singer and writer. He became famous when he appeared in Julian Mitchell's play and movie Another Country playing an openly homosexual student at an English public school in the 1930s. He has since appeared in many other works, including My Best Friend's Wedding, The Next Best Thing and the Shrek sequels. Everett left school at 16 and ran away to London to become an actor. In order to support himself, he worked as a prostitute for drugs and money—he disclosed this information in an interview for US magazine in 1997. After being dismissed from the Central School of Speech and Drama, he travelled to Scotland and got a job at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow. In the 21st century, Everett has been writing. He has been a Vanity Fair contributing editor, has written for The Guardian and wrote a film screenplay on playwright Oscar Wilde's final years. In 2006 Everett published a memoir, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins, in which he reveals his six-year affair with British television presenter Paula Yates. Although he is sometimes described as bisexual, as opposed to homosexual, he described his heterosexual affairs during a radio show with Jonathan Ross as the result of adventurousness: \"I was basically adventurous, I think I wanted to try everything\".\"Ross apologises for swearing star.\" BBC News. Everett criticised the introduction of same-sex marriage, claiming, \"I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster\". ==Filmography== Year Title Role Notes 1982 A Shocking Accident Jerome and Mr. Weathersby Short film 1983 Princess Daisy Ram Valenski TV miniseries 1984 Another Country Guy Bennett based on the young Guy Burgess Nominated – BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer 1985 Dance with a Stranger David Blakeley 1986 Duet for One Constantine Kassanis 1987 The Gold Rimmed Glasses Davide Lattes aka Gli occhiali d'oro 1987 Hearts of Fire James Colt 1987 Chronicle of a Death Foretold Bayardo San Román 1987 The Right-Hand Man Lord Harry Ironminster Australian film, based on the book of the same name 1990 The Comfort of Strangers Colin 1994 Prêt-à-Porter Jack Lowenthal aka Ready to Wear (Prêt-à-Porter) 1994 The Madness of King George George, Prince of Wales 1994 Cemetery Man Francesco Dellamorte aka Dellamorte Dellamore 1996 Dunston Checks In Lord Rutledge 1997 My Best Friend's Wedding George Downes American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture Florida Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture Nominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture Nominated – BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role Nominated – MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance Nominated – MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance Nominated – Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Supporting Actor 1998 Shakespeare in Love Christopher Marlowe Uncredited 1998 B.
