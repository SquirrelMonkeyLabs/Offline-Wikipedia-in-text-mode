Having the river and a railroad for transportation made it easier to ship the items made in Brantford. That helped Brantford change from a farming town to an industrial city. By the 1980s and 1990s, business in Brantford was dropping and some companies like White Farm Equipment, Massey- Ferguson, Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and others stopped making products. Many people lost their factory jobs. A new piece of highway (Highway 403) was built in 1997. The new highway made it easier to drive Hamilton and Toronto, and also to Detroit and Buffalo.
