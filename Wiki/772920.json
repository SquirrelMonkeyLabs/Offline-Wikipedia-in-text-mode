 "text": "Fullerton is a city in northern Orange County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, 143,617 people lived in Fullerton. There are a number of major schools in Fullerton. These include Cal State Fullerton, Hope International University, Marshall B. Ketchum University, and Fullerton College (one of California's oldest and most renowned junior colleges). Originally, Fullerton was an agricultural community. In the early 1900s, the downtown became an urban area. Many of the homes and buildings date from the 1920s, right before the stock market crash that started the Great Depression. After World War II, the city became suburbs of Los Angeles. Fullerton's population peaked in the 2010s and has started to slowly decline. Fullerton is the birthplace of the electric guitar, first produced by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Other points of interest include the largest 9/11 memorial outside of the East Coast and the Muckenthaler, an estate now used for performing arts and other events. The Coyote Hills is a small mountain range running along the north side of the city. Hiking and horseback riding trails cut through those hills. ==References== Category:Cities in California Category:Settlements in Orange County, California",
