 "text": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), formerly known as dementia pugilistica, is a neurodegenerative disease found in people who have had multiple head injuries. These injuries can be from contact sports such as American football or boxing, as well as from military service, domestic violence and other causes. Symptoms may include behavioral problems, mood problems, and problems with thinking. It can also cause problems with balance, moving and speaking. This typically does not begin until years after the injuries. It often gets worse over time and can result in dementia. It is unclear if the risk of suicide is increased. Doctors can only tell for sure if somebody has CTE by looking at their brain after they die. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the nervous system",
