 "text": "The yellow heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes luteolus) is a frog. It lives in the Brazil. It lives in the states Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Bahia. People have seen it as high as 650 meters above sea level. This frog lives in the Atlantic forest and Caaatingas. It lives on bromeliad plants. The female frog lays a few eggs at a time. This frog is not in danger of dying out. Some frogs are in danger because human beings change its forests or come into the forest to take away the bromeliad plants. But unlike some other frogs in Phyllodytes, this frog can live in places that human beings have changed. For example, it can live in forests that grow back after being cut down. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
