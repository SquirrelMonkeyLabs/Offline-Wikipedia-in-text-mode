 "text": "Hydrogen halides (or hydrohalic acids) are inorganic compounds that contain a hydrogen atom and a halogen atom. The halogens are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Astatine does not make a stable hydrogen halide, so it is not included. The hydrogen halides are diatomic molecules with no tendency to ionize in the gas phase. Chemists therefore distinguish hydrogen chloride from hydrochloric acid. The former is a gas at room temperature that reacts with water to give the acid. Once the acid has formed, the diatomic molecule can not easily be regenerated. compound formula structure model d(H−X) / pm (gas phase) μ / D Notes hydrogen fluoride HF 91.7 1.86 Highly toxic, weak acid hydrogen chloride HCl 127.4 1.11 Strong acid, most common hydrogen bromide HBr 141.4 0.788 Strong acid hydrogen iodide HI 160.9 0.382 Strong acid, reducing agent Category:Hydrogen compounds Category:Binary acids Category:Halides",
