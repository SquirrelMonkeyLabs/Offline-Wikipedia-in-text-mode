 "text": "Christopher John Pincher (born 24 September 1969) is a British Conservative Party politician. He became the Minister of State for Housing in February 2020. He was Minister of State for Europe and the Americas and Deputy Chief Government Whip and has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tamworth since 2010. Pincher was first elected as MP for Tamworth at the 2010 general election. He was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond from 2015 to 2016. After two men accused Pincher of groping while he was drunk, he resigned as Deputy Chief Whip on 30 June 2022, and had the Conservative Party whip removed. This caused a scandal over his appointment to the role, leading to a government crisis and the eventual resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:UK MPs 2010–2015 Category:UK MPs 2015–2017 Category:UK MPs 2017–2019 Category:UK MPs 2019–2024 Category:Politicians from Staffordshire Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs",
