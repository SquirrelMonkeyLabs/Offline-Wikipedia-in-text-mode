 "text": "Biosynthesis is the production of complex molecules within living organisms or cells. Biosynthesis takes simple molecules and turns them into bigger molecules. ==Properties== Biosynthesis happens because of chemical reactions. Biosynthesis needs these things to happen: *Precursor molecules: Precursor molecules are the starting molecules in biosynthesis. *Chemical energy: Energy is needed to turn the precursor molecules into the result. *Catalytic enzymes: Enzymes help the reactions go faster. Enzymes also lower the energy needed. *Coenzymes: Coenzymes help the chemical reactions. ==References== Category:biology",
