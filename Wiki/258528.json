 "text": "Sinner is the first album by nu metal band Drowning Pool. The album is the band's most popular, reaching platinum only six weeks after it came out. This was thought to be because of the song \"Bodies\", often known as \"Let The Bodies Hit The Floor\", which remains the band's most well-known song. This was the only album to have lead singer Dave Williams. While touring in support of Sinner, he died on August 14, 2002 from heart failure. The album debuted at #14 on the Billboard 200 chart.
