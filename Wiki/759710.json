 "text": "The World Snooker Championship snooker tournament founded in 1927 and since 1977 played at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The event is played over 17 days in late April and early May, and is chronologically the third of the three Triple Crown events of the season since 1977–78, when the UK Championship was first held. The event was not held from 1941 to 1945 because of World War II or between 1958 and 1963 due to declining interest. The governing body that organises this event is the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Prior to this in 1968, the world championship was organised by the Billiards Association and Control Council (BACC), except for a few years when the Professional Billiards Players' Association (PBPA) staged their own event, the World Professional Match-play Championship. The best player at the World Snooker Championship was Joe Davis, who won 15 consecutive titles between 1927 and 1946. The record in the modern era, usually dated from 1969 of a knock-out tournament format, rather than a challenge format, is held by Stephen Hendry, who won the title 7 times between 1990 and 1999. ==Champions== Format Organiser Knockout tournament () BACC Challenge event with defending champion receiving a bye to the final (*) BACC World Professional Match-play Championship (◊) PBPA Challenge matches (‡) BACC Knockout tournament WPBSA List of World Snooker Championship winners Year Winner Runner-up Final score Season Venue 1927 20–11 n/a Camkin's Hall, Birmingham 1928* n/a Camkin's Hall, Birmingham 1929 19–14 n/a Lounge Hall, Nottingham 1930 25–12 n/a Thurston's Hall, London 1931 25–21 n/a Lounge Hall, Nottingham 1932 30–19 n/a Thurston's Hall, London 1933 25–18 n/a 1934 25–22 n/a Lounge Hall, Nottingham and Central Hall, Kettering 1935 25–20 n/a Thurston's Hall, London 1936 34–27 n/a 1937 32–29 n/a 1938 37–24 n/a 1939 43–30 n/a 1940 37–36 n/a 1941–1945: No tournament 1941–1945: No tournament 1941–1945: No tournament 1941–1945: No tournament 1941–1945: No tournament 1941–1945: No tournament 1946 78–67 n/a Royal Horticultural Hall, London 1947 82–63 n/a Leicester Square Hall, London 1948 84–61 n/a 1949 80–65 n/a 1950 51–46 n/a Tower Circus, Blackpool 1951 58–39 n/a 1952 94–49 n/a Houldsworth Hall, Manchester 1952◊ 38–35 n/a Tower Circus, Blackpool 1953◊ 37–34 n/a Leicester Square Hall, London 1954◊ 45–26 n/a Houldsworth Hall, Manchester 1955◊ 38–35 n/a Tower Circus, Blackpool 1956◊ 38–35 n/a 1957◊ 39–34 n/a Jersey Billiards Association Match Room, St Helier, Jersey 1958–1963: No tournament 1958–1963: No tournament 1958–1963: No tournament 1958–1963: No tournament 1958–1963: No tournament 1958–1963: No tournament 1964‡ 19–16 1963–64 Burroughes Hall, London 1964‡ 40–33 1964–65 1965‡ 37–36 1964–65 1965‡ 25–22 1965–66 South Africa 1965‡ 39–12 1965–66 1966‡ 5–2 1965–66 St George's Hall, Liverpool 1968‡ 39–34 1967–68 Co-operative Hall, Bolton 1969 37–24 1968–69 Victoria House, London 1970 37–33 1969–70 1971 37–29 1970–71 Chevron Hotel, Sydney 1972 37–31 1971–72 Selly Park British Legion, Birmingham 1973 38–32 1972–73 City Exhibition Hall, Manchester 1974 22–12 1973–74 Belle Vue, Manchester 1975 31–30 1974–75 Nunawading Basketball Centre, Melbourne, Australia 1976 27–16 1975–76 Wythenshawe Forum, Manchester 1977 25–21 1976–77 Crucible Theatre, Sheffield 1978 25–18 1977–78 1979 24–16 1978–79 1980 18–16 1979–80 1981 18–12 1980–81 1982 18–15 1981–82 1983 18–6 1982–83 1984 18–16 1983–84 1985 18–17 1984–85 1986 18–12 1985–86 1987 18–14 1986–87 1988 18–11 1987–88 1989 18–3 1988–89 1990 18–12 1989–90 1991 18–11 1990–91 1992 18–14 1991–92 1993 18–5 1992–93 1994 18–17 1993–94 1995 18–9 1994–95 1996 18–12 1995–96 1997 18–12 1996–97 1998 18–12 1997–98 1999 18–11 1998–99 2000 18–16 2001 18–14 2000–01 2002 18–17 2001–02 2003 18–16 2002–03 2004 18–8 2003–04 2005 18–16 2004–05 2006 18–14 2005–06 2007 18–13 2006–07 2008 18–8 2007–08 2009 18–9 2008–09 2010 18–13 2009–10 2011 18–15 2010–11 2012 18–11 2011–12 2013 18–12 2012–13 2014 18–14 2013–14 2015 18–15 2014–15 2016 18–14 2015–16 2017 18–15 2016–17 2018 18–16 2017–18 2019 18–9 2018–19 2020 18–8 2019–20 2021 18–15 2020–21 2022 18–13 2021–22 2023 18–15 2022–23 2024 18–14 2023–24 2025 – 2024–25 == Statistics == === Multiple champions === Snooker World Champions multiple times Player Total Years Status Joe Davis 15 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1946 † 10/7/1978 Fred Davis 8 1948, 1949, 1951, 1952*, 1953*, 1954*, 1955*, 1956* † 16/4/1998 John Pulman 8 1957*, 1964, 1964, 1965, 1965, 1965, 1966, 1968 † 25/12/1998 Stephen Hendry 7 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999 active Ronnie O'Sullivan 7 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2020, 2022 active Steve Davis 6 1981, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1989 retired Ray Reardon 6 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1978 retired John Higgins ¤ 4 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011 active Mark Selby ¤ 4 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021 active Mark Williams ¤ 3 2000, 2003, 2018 active John Spencer 3 1969, 1971, 1977 † 11/7/2006 Walter Donaldson 2 1947, 1950 † 24/5/1973 Alex Higgins 2 1972, 1982 † 24/7/2010 Key Challenge match * World Professional Match-play Championship ¤ Player competed in 2019 === Champions by country === Champions by country (since 1969) Country Players Total First title Last title 10 25 1969 2022 3 12 1990 2011 3 10 1970 2018 2 3 1972 1985 1 1 1980 1980 1 1 1997 1997 1 1 2010 2010 Champions by country (all- time) Country Players Total First title Last title 13 56 1927 2022 4 14 1947 2011 3 10 1970 2018 2 3 1972 1985 2 2 1952 2010 1 1 1980 1980 1 1 1997 1997 == Notes == == References == Category:World Snooker Championship",
