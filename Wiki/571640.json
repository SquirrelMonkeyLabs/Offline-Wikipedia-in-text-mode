 "text": "A general election was held on the 8 June 2017 to elect all 650 members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. It ended in a hung parliament, with the Conservative Party winning the most seats. They made a confidence-and- supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party so they could pass a vote of no confidence. Theresa May stayed as prime minister. Labour won a lot of seats from the Conservatives. This was the first time Labour had gained seats since 1997. The election happened because Parliament voted for a snap election after the 2016 Brexit referendum. ==Date== The next general election was due to be held on 8 May 2020. Theresa May announced on 18 April 2017 that she wanted it to be held on 8 June . The House of Commons voted in favour of this proposal on 19 April 2017 allowing the election to take place in June 2017. ==Results== ===Exit poll=== BBC News, ITV and Sky News all released an exit poll at 10pm. This poll predicted the Conservatives would be the largest party but lose their majority. Exit poll results: *Conservative Party - 314 *Labour Party - 266 *Scottish National Party - 34 *Liberal Democrats - 14 *Plaid Cymru - 3 *Green Party - 1 *UK Independence Party - 0 *Others - 18 ===Final results=== The final results were very similar to the exit poll. *Conservative Party - 317 (down 13 seats) *Labour Party - 262 (up 30 seats) *Scottish National Party - 35 (down 21 seats) *Liberal Democrats - 12 (up 4 seats) *Plaid Cymru - 3 (no change) *Green Party - 1 (no change) *United Kingdom Independence Party - 0 (down 1 seat) *Others - 18 When the election was called the Conservative Party had a big lead in the polls and they were expected to win by a landslide. As the campaign went on the Labour Party closed the gap in the polls and the Conservatives lost their majority in the House of Commons. Important MPs who lost their seats include former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond and The leader of the SNP in the House of Commons Angus Robertson. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2017 in the United Kingdom Category:June 2017 events Category:United Kingdom general elections",
