 "text": "The yellowtail damselfish (Microspathodon chrysurus) is a species of damselfish native to tropical areas such as the Caribbean coast of Panama. Damselfish are plentiful in coral reef environments. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this fish as being of “least concern”. The species is exploited on a minor scale, for fisheries and the aquarium trade. It may be threatened by the invasive lionfish. Adult and young adult damselfish differ significantly in terms of body color. The difference was so noticeable that researchers believed the adult and young adult forms were two distinct species. Adults are brown with a yellow caudal fin. Young adults are violet with blue spots in their back and transparent caudal fins. == Reproduction == The spawning (laying eggs) cycle of the yellowtail damselfish starts at sunrise and lasts approximately 1 hour after male damselfish have prepared nests on dead coral surfaces. Their eggs are demersal, sticking to the coral where males guard and fan oxygen over them. Hatching occurs the morning of the 6th day of incubation. Reproductive activity is highest during the lunar period between full and new moon. At those points in the lunar cycle, the pull of the sun and the moon are very high resulting in spring tides. ==Gallery== File:Elkhorn Coral with a Yellowtail Damselfish in the Caribbean Sea in Curaçao.jpg|Elkhorn coral with a Yellowtail Damselfish in the Caribbean Sea in Curaçao File:Yellotaildamsel.jpg File:Damselfish- Microspathodon chrysurus.jpg File:Damselfish MicrospathodonChrysurus.jpg File:Yellowtail Damselfish2.jpg ==References== ==Other websites== chrysurus Category:Fish of the Caribbean",
