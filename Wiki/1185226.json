 "text": "The cumene process or Hock process is a chemical reaction used in the chemical industry. It makes phenol and acetone, two important commodity chemicals, from benzene and propylene. It is named for cumene, which is made as the first step of the process. The cumene process happens in three steps. First, a Friedel- Crafts reaction attaches the propylene molecule to the benzene ring, making cumene. The cumene is then exposed to oxygen, changing it into cumene hydroperoxide (an autoxidation reaction). Finally, the hydroperoxide goes through a rearrangement reaction called the Hock rearrangement, and breaks apart into the phenol and acetone products. Acid catalysts are needed for both the Friedel-Crafts reaction and the Hock rearrangement. == References == Category:Chemical reactions",
