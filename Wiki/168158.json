 "text": "Mathematical induction is a special way of proving a mathematical truth. It can be used to prove that something is true for all the natural numbers (or all positive numbers from a point onwards). The idea is that if: # Something is true for the first case (base case); # Whenever that same thing is true for a case, it will be true for the next case (inductive case), then * That same thing is true for every case by induction. In the careful language of mathematics, a proof by induction often proceeds as follows: * State that the proof will be by induction over n. (n is the induction variable.) * Show that the statement is true when n is 1. * Assume that the statement is true for any natural number n. (This is called the induction step.) ** Show then that the statement is true for the next number, n+1. Because it is true for 1, then it is true for 1+1 (=2, by the induction step), then it is true for 2+1 (=3), then it is true for 3+1 (=4), and so on. ==Examples of proof by induction== ===Sum of the first n natural numbers=== Prove that for all natural numbers n: :1+2+3+....+(n-1)+n=\\tfrac12 n(n+1) Proof: First, the statement can be written as: :2\\sum_{k=1}^n k=n(n+1) (for all natural numbers n) By induction on n, First, for n=1: :2\\sum_{k=1}^1 k=2(1)=1(1+1), so this is true. Next, assume that for some n=n0 the statement is true. That is,: :2\\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k = n_0(n_0+1) Then for n=n0+1: :2\\sum_{k=1}^{{n_0}+1} k can be rewritten as :2\\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k+(n_0+1) \\right) Since 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k = n_0(n_0+1), :2\\sum_{k=1}^{n_0+1} k = n_0(n_0+1)+2(n_0+1) =(n_0+1)(n_0+2) Hence the proof is complete by induction. ===The sum of the interior angles of a polygon=== Mathematical induction is often stated with the starting value 0 (rather than 1). In fact, it will work just as well with a variety of starting values. Here is an example when the starting value is 3: \"The sum of the interior angles of a n-sided polygon is (n-2)180 degrees.\" The initial starting value is 3, and the interior angles of a triangle is (3-2)180 degrees. Assume that the interior angles of a n-sided polygon is (n-2)180 degrees. Add on a triangle which makes the figure a n+1-sided polygon, and that increases the count of the angles by 180 degrees (n-2)180+180=(n+1-2)180 degrees. Since both the base case and the inductive case are handled, the proof is now complete. There are a great many mathematical objects for which proofs by mathematical induction works. The technical term is a well-ordered set. ==Inductive definition== The same idea can work to define a set of objects, as well as to prove statements about that set of objects. For example, we can define nth degree cousin as follows: *A 1st degree cousin is the child of a parent's sibling. *A n+1st degree cousin is the child of a parent's nth degree cousin. There is a set of axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers which is based on mathematical induction. This is called \"Peano's Axioms\". The undefined symbols are | and =.The axioms are *| is a natural number. * If n is a natural number, then n| is a natural number. *If n| = m| then n = m. One can then define the operations of addition and multiplication and so on by mathematical induction. For example: *m + | = m| *m + n| = (m + n)| == Related pages == * Mathematical proof * Proof by contradiction == References == Category:Mathematics",
