 "text": "Brent Wilson (born July 20th, 1987) is an American former bassist for the rock band Panic! at the Disco. He recorded one studio album with the band, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (2005). He was fired and replaced by Jon Walker on May 17, 2006. On January 22nd, 2021 Wilson was arrested during a traffic stop where he was found to have been carrying drugs. On November 15, 2022, Wilson was sentenced to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. == Panic! At the Disco (2004-2006) == Wilson joined Panic! At the Disco in 2004. The band’s debut studio album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, was released on September 27, 2005. The album was an unexpected success, going 4x platinum and propelling the band into superstardom. == Dismissal from Panic! At the Disco (2006) == On May 17, 2006, Panic! at the Disco announced that Wilson had been fired, stating, “There really isn’t a good way to say this, and it was a decision that was very tough to make, but feels like it will be the right decision for everyone. We regret to inform you that Brent is no longer a part of Panic at the Disco, and although this choice does feel very healthy, he is a great friend of ours and he will definitely be missed. We all wish him well and the best of luck in everything he wants to do in the future. The last few years will be something we will never forget, all the places we’ve been that we never thought we’d go and things we’ve seen that we thought we’d never see when we started this band. Right now, our friend Jon is going to be filling in, and I’m sure it would ease his nerves a bit to get a warm reception. We’re at home preparing for the summer tour, and we’ve never worked so hard on putting something together. I can’t tell you how excited we are for these shows and for you all to see what we’ve been planning, we’ve got a few tricks up our sleeves… just you wait.” The band faced heavy backlash for the firing, including from Wilson’s brother, Blake. This caused a feud between the two parties, including claims of betrayal on Panic’s part and performance problems and substance abuse on Wilson’s part. Wilson also filed a suit against the band, claiming he was owed royalties. == Aftermath and Arrest == After his time in Panic! At the Disco, he went on to become an accountant for a commercial real estate agency and got married, having a son named Connor. In July of 2018, he pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance. On January 22nd, 2021, Wilson was pulled over after he crossed three lanes of traffic without a turn signal, cutting off oncoming traffic. During the stop, a search of Wilson and the vehicle uncovered 13 grams of meth, 1.2 grams of cocaine, 62.6 grams of heroin, a scale, small baggies, foil covered in residue, and a loaded Glock 17. Wilson, who was on parole at the time of the arrest, was also said to be out two hours beyond his curfew deadline. On November 15, 2022, Wilson was sentenced to 46 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release for possession with the intent to distribute heroin and felon in possession of a firearm. ==References== Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Bassists Category:American guitarists Category:Musicians from Las Vegas Category:Panic! at the Disco members",
