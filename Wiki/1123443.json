 "text": "Cassidy's poison dart frog (Andinobates cassidyhornae) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Body== The adult frog is 19.03 ± 0.31 mm long from nose to rear end. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The skin of the frog's back is red in color with black spots. The skin of the frog's belly is black with red spots. Parts of the face, for example the eardrum are dark brown or black in color. The rear end is bright red with some black marks. The sides of the body are red. The front legs are red near the top, brown in the middle, and dark brown near the front feet. The ends of the front toes are light brown. The tops of the back legs are red in color with brown spots. The lower parts of the back legs are brown with red spots. The iris of the eye is dark brown in color and the pupil of the eye is hard to see because the iris is so dark. When a animal that wants to eat the frog bites the frog, that part of the frog's skin turns back. Scientists do not know if any one black mark is a regular spot or a bite. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for Cassidy Horn, who studied poison frogs. ==Home== This frog lives in the dead leaves on the ground in cloud forests between 1800 and 2100 meters above sea level. Some of the places where this frog lives are protected parks: Mesenia-Paramillo Nature Reserve, the Hummingbird Conservancy, and Reserva Regional del Citará. ==Young== The male frog calls to the female frog during the middle of the day. The female frog calls back. Scientists think this frog lays eggs during March and April, when there is the most water. Scientists have seen male frogs carrying tadpoles on their backs. They have seen frogs swimming in water in bromeliad plants and in Wettinia palm plants. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because people change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for cows to eat grass and get wood to build with. Chemicals that make plants grow and other bad chemicals can also kill this frog. Scientists think people might also catch this frog to sell as a pet. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
