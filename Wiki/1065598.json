The arena was also the home of the Atlanta Thrashers of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1999 until 2011 and the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 2008 until 2016, and again in 2019. They first started to build the stadium on June 5, 1997 on the site of the demolished Omni Coliseum. The arena opened on September 18, 1999 and the first event was a concert by Sir Elton John on his Medusa Tour. The Hawks had their first game in the arena on November 4, 1999. In their first game, they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks 199–109. The Thrashers had their first game at the arena on October 2, 1999.
