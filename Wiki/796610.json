 "text": "The Supercoppa Italiana () is an annual football competition. It is usually held the week before the Serie A season begins in Italy, or more recently in other countries during the winter. It is contested by the winners of the Serie A and the Coppa Italia in the previous season, as a curtain-raiser to the new season. If the same team wins both the Serie A and Coppa Italia titles in the previous season, the Supercoppa is contested by the Serie A winner and the Coppa Italia runner-up. ==History== Created in 1988, 18 of the first 21 Supercoppa Italiana contested were played at the home of the Serie A champions, the exceptions being in 1993 and 2003, when it was held in the United States cities of Washington, D.C., and East Rutherford, New Jersey, and in 2002 when the game was played in the Libyan capital Tripoli. Since 2009, the venues chosen have mostly been outside of Italy. Of the 32 finals played to date, the venues have been as follows: * 19 times at the home of the Serie A champion * 4 times in China * twice in the United States * twice in Doha, Qatar * twice at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome acting as a \"neutral venue\" (where it was not the home ground of the Serie A champion). * twice in Saudi Arabia * once in Tripoli, Libya Since the game was first established, the Serie A scudetto and Coppa Italia have been won by the same team eight times, thus making the Coppa Italia runner-up the second participant in the subsequent Supercoppa. This occurred in the following years: 1995, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (Juventus), 2000 (Lazio), 2006 and 2010 (Internazionale). In 2018, the Serie A entered into a contract with the General Sports Authority, under which Saudi Arabia will host three out of the next five Supercoppa events. ==Winners== Year Serie A champion Result Coppa Italia representative ScorersSerie A winner's scorers listed first.
