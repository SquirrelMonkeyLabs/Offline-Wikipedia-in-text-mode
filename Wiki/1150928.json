 "text": "General elections were held in Uruguay on 25 October 2009 alongside a two-part referendum. As no candidate for president won more than 50% of the vote, a second round was held on 29 November between the top two candidates, Jos√© Mujica of the Broad Front and former president Luis Alberto Lacalle of the National Party. Mujica won the run-off with 55% of the vote. In the parliamentary elections, the Broad Front kept its majorities in both chambers, winning 16 of the 30 seats in the senators and 50 of the 99 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. ==References== Category:21st century in Uruguay Category:2000s in South America Category:2009 elections Category:Elections in Uruguay Category:October 2009 events Category:November 2009 events",
