 "text": "Source bias is a term from psychology. It means that when people select sources from where to get their information, they are more likely to pick either those sources that confirm what they already believe, or those that are very negative. This will then create so-called echo chambers for them. In news reporting, source bias affects how news organizations do news gathering in whom they choose to talk, and in news analysis, what they imply in the way they arrange facts collected. == References == Category:Bias Category:Mass media",
