In 1962, Adams became a secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Not long after becoming more involved in civil rights, Adams led a boycott against businesses in Hattiesburg. She also helped to organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Adams, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Annie Devine (fellow activists) were chosen to be the represent the MFDP. They traveled to Atlantic City to go to the Democratic Convention.
