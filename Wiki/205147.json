 "text": "Vassiriki Abou Diaby (born 11 May 1986), known as Abou Diaby, is a French former professional footballer. He played primarily in a box to box role, adept at both attacking and defending, and was described as a player who was \"languid, elusive, and athletic\" that could either \"dribble past opponents or slip passes to team-mates\". Of Ivorian descent, Diaby also possessed \"superb touch\" and \"excellent close control\". Diaby's career was hampered by numerous repetitive injuries, a problem that existed from his time in France. His physical appearance and positional preference evoked comparisons to Arsenal compatriot Patrick Vieira. == Career statistics == === Club === Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National cup League cup Europe Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Auxerre 2004–05 Ligue 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 2005–06 Ligue 1 5 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 1 Total 10 1 0 0 0 0 4 0 14 1 Arsenal 2005–06 Premier League 12 1 1 0 1 0 2 0 16 1 2006–07 Premier League 12 1 1 0 4 0 1 0 18 1 2007–08 Premier League 15 1 2 0 5 1 6 2 28 4 2008–09 Premier League 24 3 5 0 0 0 7 1 36 4 2009–10 Premier League 29 6 1 0 0 0 10 1 40 7 2010–11 Premier League 16 2 3 0 0 0 1 0 20 2 2011–12 Premier League 4 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 5 0 2012–13 Premier League 11 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 15 0 2013–14 Premier League 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2014–15 Premier League 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 Total 124 14 16 0 11 1 29 4 180 19 Marseille 2015–16 Ligue 1 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2016–17 Ligue 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 Total 5 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 Career total 139 15 17 0 11 1 33 4 200 20 === International === Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Season Apps Goals France 2006–07 2 0 2007–08 0 0 2008–09 0 0 2009–10 6 0 2010–11 7 0 2011–12 0 0 2012–13 1 1 Total 16 1 :Scores and results list France's goal tally first, score column indicates score after Diaby goal.
