He originally became famous as a running back at the collegiate and professional levels, and was the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He later worked as an actor, spokesman, and broadcaster. O. J. Simpson is famous for being accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994.

Simpson was put on trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. The court case took many months, and the newspapers and television news followed it closely. The criminal court in Los Angeles, California found that Simpson was not guilty of those murders in 1995. However, Goldman's family sued Simpson for wrongful death in civil court. In 1997, the civil court said Simpson was liable for their wrongful deaths, but to date he has paid little of the $33.5 million he was ordered to pay. In late 2006, Simpson wrote a book titled If I Did It. The book is a first-person fictional story of the murder of Brown and Goldman if Simpson had done it. It was withdrawn by the publisher just before its release. The book was later released by the Goldman family and the title of the book was expanded to If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer (). As of March 2016, interest has grown in his murder case after a former police officer came forward with a knife that may have been used as the murder weapon. ==Conviction== In September 2007, Simpson faced more lawsuits.
