 "text": "The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the Sultanate of Zanzibar, a state in and capital of the country of Zanzibar, and the United Kingdom on 27 August 1896. Lasting between 38 and 45 minutes, it is the shortest recorded war in history. ==Background== The current Sultan (the person who rules the Sultanate of Zanzibar), Sultan Hamad bin Thwaini, who was pro-British, died. While he was alive, because he was English Council approved, he and the Sultanate of Zanzibar were on good terms with England, but when he died, a new Sultan was needed. Sultan Khalid bin Barghash, his 29-year-old nephew eventually became his successor, but Khalid was no-longer approved by England, now making him and his state enemies with the English Army. England told him to come out of hiding, but the new Sultan's response was to barricade himself in his palace even more. As expected, the Sultanate of Zanzibar was absolutely destroyed by the English Army, which led to what we know today as the Anglo-Zanzibar war, the shortest recorded war in history that lasted between 38 and 45 minutes. == Casualties and losses == There were varying casualties on both sides. For England, only a single sailor was wounded, but for the Sultanate of Zanzibar five hundred were killed or injured (including civilians), 4 artillery pieces were destroyed, a shore battery was destroyed, two other boats were sunk, and the HHS Glasgow (the Sultan's personal royal ship) was sunk. The Sultan's palace was also burned down to the ground. == Aftermath == Khalid was captured by English forces in 1916, and a new Sultan, Sultan Hamoud, became his successor. This new leader was extraordinarily loyal to England and their council, which definitely helped Zanzibar recover from this attack, as England decided not to impose new harsh rules on their relationship with the sultanate. ==References== Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:1896 Category:Zanzibar",
