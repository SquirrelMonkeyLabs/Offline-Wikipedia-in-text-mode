It tells the story of the Forrester family, who owns a fashion empire called Forrester Creations. The major members of the family are Eric Forrester (played by John McCook), the president of Forrester Creations, his wife Stephanie (Susan Flannery), their eldest son Ridge (Ronn Moss) and Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang), who was married to both the father and the son. She owns most of Forrester Creations. This is because she created BeLieF, a formula which earned much money for the company. There used to be a second fashion company called Spectra Fashions. It was Forresterâ€™s main competitor. The conflicts between the Forrester and the Spectra families was one of the major themes of the story. == List of actors/characters on the show == Actor Character Texas Battle Marcus Walton Brandon Beemer Owen Knight Drew Tyler Bell Thomas Forrester Don Diamont Bill Spencer Lesley-Anne Down Jacqueline Payne Marone Susan Flannery Stephanie Forrester Jennifer Gareis Donna Logan Forrester Harley Graham Alexandria Forrester Winsor Harmon Thorne Forrester Mykel Shannon Jenkins Detective Charlie Baker Ashley Jones Dr. Bridget Forrester Marone Lesli Kay Felicia Forrester Katherine Kelly Lang Brooke Logan Kyle Lowder Rick Forrester John McCook Eric Forrester Daniel McVicar Clarke Garrison Alley Mills Pamela Douglas Ronn Moss Ridge Forrester Amanda and Rachel Pace Hope Logan Ridge Perkett R.J.
