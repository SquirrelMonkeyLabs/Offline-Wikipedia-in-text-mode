 "text": "Sonic & Knuckles is the fifth video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It was made by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis in 1994. It is the second part of Sonic the Hedgehog 3. In the game, players are able to play as Sonic the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna. A Sonic 2 or Sonic 3 cartridge can be inserted into it to unlock new modes for those games. This is called \"Lock-on Technology\". ==Plot== Continuing right after the ending of Sonic 3, Sonic and Tails discover the Super Emeralds in Mushroom Hill Zone. They are more powerful versions of the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic and Tails head to Hidden Palace Zone and fight Knuckles. After Sonic and Tails win, the three see Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald and betraying Knuckles. Knuckles switches sides and joins Sonic and Tails. Using the last of his energy, Knuckles leads them to Sky Sanctuary Zone so that they can climb onto the now- repaired Death Egg and confront Robotnik. If the player has collected all of the Super Emeralds in the special stages, Hyper Sonic can fight Robotnik's final weapon in outer space. After destroying it, Sonic returns the Master Emerald and leaves with Tails. Knuckles, as the emeralds' guardian, stays on the island. ==Gameplay== ==Notes== Category:1994 video games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video game expansion packs Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Virtual Console games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games",
