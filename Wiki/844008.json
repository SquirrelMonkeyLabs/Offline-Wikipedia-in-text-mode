 "text": "Ronald Reagan announced his candidacy for President of the United States on November 20, 1975. Reagan won primaries in several states, but eventually lost the nomination to incumbent president Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention. In 1976, Reagan challenged incumbent President Gerald Ford when they both tried to become the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon created himself as the conservative candidate. However, as the GOP convention neared, Ford appeared close to victory. Ford won the nomination with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070. Ford would go on to lose the 1976 presidential election to the Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter. ==References== Category:1976 in the United States Category:Ronald Reagan Reagan 1976",
