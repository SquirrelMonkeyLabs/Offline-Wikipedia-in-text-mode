 "text": "Interstate 80 is an Interstate Highway in the United States. It goes from San Francisco, California east to Teaneck, New Jersey (just outside of New York City). The route is long, making it the second longest Interstate Highway in the United States behind I-90. It goes through 11 states: California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. I-80 is the Interstate Highway that closely follows the route of the historic Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. The highway traces other historical routes in the Western United States: the Oregon Trail across Wyoming and Nebraska, the California Trail across most of Nevada and California, and except in the Great Salt Lake area, the entire route of the First Transcontinental Railroad. From near Chicago, Illinois, east to near Youngstown, Ohio, Interstate 80 is a toll road, containing the majority of both the Indiana Toll Road and the Ohio Turnpike. It also has a small part of the Illinois Tollway. I-80 and Interstate 90 share the same road from near Portage, Indiana to Elyria, Ohio. I-80 becomes the Keystone Shortway (a freeway built across rural northern Pennsylvania.) The eastern end of I-80 is its junction with the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 95 just west of the George Washington Bridge entering New York City. == References == 80",
