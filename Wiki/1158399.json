At the age of 100 years, 89 days, Carter was the longest-lived U.S. president in history and the only president to have turned 100 years old. ==Background== After many years of health problems, such as being diagnosed with melanoma that metastasized to his brain and liver, the Carter Center announced on February 18, 2023, that Carter was staying at home to receive hospice care instead of more medical help. The following week after the announcement, it was said that Carter's close family members had come to his home in Georgia to spend his final days with him, although local news reported four months later that Carter was \"in great spirits, visiting with family and still enjoying ice cream\". ==Death== On December 29, 2024, Carter died at his home in Plains, Georgia. Carter's son, James E. Carter III, announced his death at 3:45 p.m. EST. ===Reactions=== President Joe Biden said that \"America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian\", and president-elect Donald Trump said Carter \"did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans.\" In an address from Saint Croix, Biden said that Carter was a \"remarkable leader\". Former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton paid tribute to Carter. Other world leaders such as French president Emmanuel Macron, European Council president António Costa, Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, British prime minister Keir Starmer, King Charles III, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel, Bangladeshi Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, German chancellor Olaf Scholz and Hungarian prime minster Viktor Orban released statements mourning Carter. Senator Bernie Sanders, for whom Carter voted during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, stated that \"Jimmy Carter, both for what he did as president and in his later years, will be remembered as a decent, honest and down-to-earth man.\" In Carter's home state of Georgia, political leaders such as Governor Brian Kemp, former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler, the state's congressional delegation and many others by both Republicans and Democrats in Georgia released statements. A moment of silence was held for Carter at the United Nations Security Council on December 30. ==Funeral== ===Georgia memorial=== On the morning of January 4, 2025, Carter's remains were taken by motorcade to Atlanta from Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia.

It then travelled to his boyhood home in nearby Archery, where the National Park Service saluted him, and the farm's bell rang 39 times in honor of him being the 39th U.S. President. It then made its way to Atlanta, where his service as Governor of Georgia was honored at the Georgia State Capitol with a moment of silence led by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, Lt.
