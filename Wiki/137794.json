 "text": "The third law of thermodynamics says: *If an object reaches the absolute zero of temperature (0 K = −273.15C = −459.67 °F), its atoms will stop moving. The definition is: at absolute zero , the entropy of a perfectly crystalline substance is zero. Experimentally, it is not possible to obtain −273.15°C, as of now. It is found that most of the gases either liquify or solidify before reaching such a temperature, gaseous molecules no longer remaining. So far, scientists have been able to get close to, but not exactly, absolute zero. This may change in the future. ==Related pages== *Zeroth law of thermodynamics *First law of thermodynamics *Second law of thermodynamics Category:Thermodynamics Category:Laws of physics",
