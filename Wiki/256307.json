Over 12 million people live in it. Its provincial capital is Suwon. Its name, Gyeonggi, means 'surrounding the capital' and it surrounds Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It is also next to Incheon. == History == Gyeonggi-do has been important since King Onjo of Baekje (one of the three kingdoms of ancient Korea) built Wiryeseong and founded the government in it. After King Taejo of Goryeo made the capital in Gaegyeong, (now Kaesong), the province became much more important, and since King Hyeonjong's period it has been called Gyeonggi. == Population == Gyeonggi-do's population increased rapidly after the modernization of South Korea because the capital, Seoul, the economic and cultural center of South Korea, is very close to it. Now the population of Gyeonggi-do is 12,649,894. == Districts == Gyeonggi province consists of 28 cities and 3 counties. == Transport == Gyeonggi Province's transport is well-developed because it is very close to Seoul—South Korea's capital—and Incheon, where Korea's biggest international airport is located. It is easy to access the capital and easy to go abroad by plane. Much of Gyeonggi Province is served by the Seoul Metropolitan Subway. ==References== == Other websites == * * Category:Provinces of South Korea",
