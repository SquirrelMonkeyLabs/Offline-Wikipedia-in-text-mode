At various times it included the towns of Deloraine, Beaconsfield, Devonport, Latrobe and New Norfolk. The Division was named after Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, the sixth Lieutenant- Governor of Tasmania. It was set up for the 1903 election. The division was abolished in 1984, and new boundaries were created. Much of the area is now included in the Division of Lyons. ==Members== Member Party Term Sir Edward Braddon Free Trade 1903–1904 Norman Cameron Free Trade 1904–1906 Independent 1906–1906 Llewellyn Atkinson Anti-Socialist 1906–1909 Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1917 Nationalist 1917–1921 Country 1921–1928 Nationalist 1928–1929 Joseph Lyons Labor 1929–1931 United Australia 1931–1939 Lancelot Spurr Labor 1939–1940 Allan Guy United Australia 1940–1946 Gil Duthie Labor 1946–1975 Max Burr Liberal 1975–1984 The most famous member was Joseph Lyons, a Premier of Tasmania, who later became the 10th Prime Minister of Australia.
