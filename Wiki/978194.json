It became the territory's anthem in 2013. The words of the song were written by Howard Fergus, and the music was composed by George Irish. Since Montserrat is a British Overseas Territory, the official national anthem is \"God Save the King\". ==Lyrics== Words of the song in English Oh Montserrat, dear Motherland Your children raise your standard high. In toil and tears to serve you well, A crowning jewel from Godâ€™s hand. Oh Montserrat, by nature blest To you your children sing Come well or woe, come friend or foe To you your people cling. Rise up and make our country great With art and skill and sacrifice With masque and drum we celebrate, Triumphant masters of our faith We sing our land in harmony May God be our eternal God And make Montserrat a house of hope, A haven in the Carib Sea. No pestilence shall mar your shore No fount of sadness overwhelm A people striving under God Their spirits free forevermore No pestilence pollutes her shore No fount of sadness overwhelm A people striving under God Their spirits free forever more. ==References== Category:Montserrat Mont",
