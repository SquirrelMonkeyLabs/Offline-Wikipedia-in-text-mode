 "text": "Taktabáj formerly Báj is a village in Tokaj District of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. Its population in 2024 was 578. == Location == It is in Taktaköz, on the right bank of the Tisza, a few kilometers north of the river. The immediate neighboring settlements are: Tarcal to the north, Csobaj to the east, and Prügy to the west, and for a short stretch its territory also touches that of Tiszadada, located on the other bank of the river. == History == The village of Taktabáj has a very old history, going back to before the time of Christ. This is proven by findings from digs in 1981, which are now shown in the Tokaj Museum. A famous old book, the Gesta Hungarorum by Anonymus, says that when the Hungarians came to this area, they took over nearby Tarcal. They brought or found a group called the Kabars, and together they protected the important military area of Taktaköz. The village was first mentioned in a document in 1413 with the name Bay. In 1446, it was called Báj, and the Zombori Cseh family owned land here. From 1700, the Patay family owned it and even got their noble title from this place. In 1726, Patay Sámuel and his wife, Mária Udvarhelyi, built a castle in the village with the help of a builder named Tamás Tornyossi from Kassa. This castle had stairs on both sides leading to a porch, a special roof, and towers on the corners. Around 1890, it was rebuilt. The park around the castle is very valuable and is now protected because of its special trees and birds. The Patay family also built a Reformed church in the village in 1782. It was fixed up in 1867. This church is special because, even though it is a Reformed church, it has colorful painted pictures and writings on the walls, and its organ still works. The Patay family’s tomb is inside the church. The church is also famous for a table where the Peace of Szatmár was signed in 1711. In 1785, the village was called Baáj, and 395 people lived there in 54 houses, making up 72 families. They worked as farmers and fishermen because the Tisza and Takta rivers often flooded the area, keeping the land underwater for a long time. == Politcs == === Mayors === * 1990–1994: János Kékedi (independent) * 1994–1998: János Kékedi (independent) * 1998–2002: János Kékedi (independent) * 2002–2006: Zoltánné Virág (independent) * 2006–2010: Zoltánné Virág (independent) * 2010–2014: Zoltánné Virág (independent) * 2014–2019: Zoltán Károlyné Virág (independent) * 2019–2024: János Rézműves (independent) * 2024–: János Rézműves (Association of Gypsy Communities) == Population == In 2022, 76.6% of the population identified as Hungarian, 7.1% as Roma, 0.2% as Ukrainian, and 0.2% as belonging to other non-domestic nationalities (23.4% did not declare; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%).
