 "text": "The white tiger or bleached tiger is a color variation of the Bengal tiger. It is sometimes reported in the wild in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar in the Sunderbans region and especially in the former State of Rewa. White tigers have the same black stripes as other Bengal tigers but they have a white or near-white coat. The white color in Bengal tigers is a result of a genetic mutation. White Bengal tigers do not have the pigment pheomelanin, which gives the orange color to regular Bengal tigers. == Appearance == White Bengal tigers have a distinctive appearance due to their white or near-white fur. They have the typical black stripes of a tiger, but their coat does not have the orange color found in regular Bengal tigers. == Genetics == The white fur is because the tiger does not have the pigment pheomelanin, which is responsible for the orange color in regular Bengal tigers. Both parents must carry the unusual gene for white coloring for a white Bengal tiger to be born naturally (a rare occurrence, happening about once in 10,000 births). Dark-striped white individuals have been documented historically in Bengal tiger subspecies and other subspecies. == Size and growth == White Bengal tigers tend to grow faster and become heavier than their orange counterparts. They are somewhat bigger at birth and as fully grown adults. Fully grown white male tigers can weigh between and reach up to in length. == Conservation and popularity == Currently, several hundred white tigers are in captivity worldwide. About one hundred are found in India. Their unique coloring has made them popular in entertainment and zoos. Their rarity could be because of reduced camouflage, affecting their ability to stalk prey or avoid predators. ==Related pages== *Bengal tiger ==References== Category:Genetics Category:Tigers Category:Endangered species",
