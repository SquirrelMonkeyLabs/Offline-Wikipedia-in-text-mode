Steele, 1982 ==History== ===19th century=== In 1879, Stafford County was created. The borders of Stafford County were defined by the Kansas Legislature of 1870. For several years, the county was still unorganized. The Legislature of 1875 gave the territory in Stafford County to other counties. They wanted to get rid of Stafford County. They gave the part in Range 15 West to Pawnee County; the portion included in Ranges 11, 12, 13 and 14 to Barton County; and the south half of the county, excepting the portion in Range 15, was added to Pratt County. But after each of the counties had taken its part, a strip six miles wide and twelve miles long (two townships) remained as Stafford County. This was the county until April 25, 1879. The Supreme Court of Kansas said that dividing the county was unconstitutional.
