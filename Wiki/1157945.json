 "text": "Comuna Izvoru Crișului () is a commune in Cluj County, Romania. == History == In 1276, the place was first mentioned as Crisfeu. During the Árpád era, this area, along with the sources of the Kalota and Almás rivers, belonged to Bihar under the Várad bishopric. However, by 1282, it was listed under Kolozs County. Its customs duties went to György Bebek (or Böbek), the royal treasurer, in 1371, and then to the Bánffy family of Losonc in 1471. In 1493, a peasant named Antal Magyar from Körösfő is mentioned as belonging to the Transylvanian bishop, and in 1504, another peasant named János Gyalui is recorded. These are the first people from Körösfő whose names we know. == Population == According to the 2011 census, the commune had a population of 1,632 people.
