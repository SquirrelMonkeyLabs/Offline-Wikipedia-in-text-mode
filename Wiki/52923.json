 "text": "Cerulean is a range of colours from teal-blue, sky-blue, bright blue, or azure to deep cyan. The word cerulean comes from the Latin word caeruleum, which means \"sky\" or \"heavens\". This was in turn from Latin caeruleus deep blue: resembling the blue of the sky. In classical times, this term was used to describe blue pigments, particularly mixtures of copper and cobaltous oxides, called genuine cerulean. These early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish hues and lack of permanence. When the artificial pigment cerulean blue was invented people started using this instead. The first recorded use of cerulean as a colour name in English was in 1590.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 190; Color Sample of Cerulean: Page 89 Plate 33 Color Sample E6 ==Meaning of cerulean== * Cerulean represents the \"sky\" or \"heavens\", or sometimes the ocean. * The United States Navy Blue Angels aerobatics team wears uniforms that are a bright rich tone of cerulean. ==Tones of cerulean color comparison chart== Name Color HEX Code Red Green Blue Hue Sat Lum Source Spanish Cerulean #A8D9F3 168 217 243 201° 76% 81% Gallego & Sanz (Ceruleo Inspecifico) Pale Cerulean #98B4D4 152 180 212 212° 41% 71% Pantone TPX 15-4020 Cerulean Frost #6D9BC3 109 155 195 208° 42% 60% (Crayola Silver Swirls) Light Artificial Cerulean #3AA1C1 58 161 193 194° 54% 49% (Gallego & Sanz) Ceruleo Sustituto Aclarado Bright Cerulean #02A4D3 2 164 211 193° 98% 42% (Crayola Cerulean) Genuine Cerulean #0096D6 0 150 210 198° 100% 42% Gallego & Sanz Ceruleo Genuino French Cerulean #0F9DEB 15 157 235 201° 88% 49% Pourpre.com (Intense) Ceruleen Intense French Cerulean #357AB7 53 122 183 208° 55% 46% Pourpre.com (Somber) Ceruleen Sombre Cerulean Blue Hue #3176AF 49 118 173 207° 56% 44% Liquitex Basic Colors #470 Cerulean Blue #2A52BE 42 82 190 224° 64% 45% Maerz & Paul (Cerulean blue pigment) Cerulean #007BA7 0 123 167 196° 100% 33% (Cerulean pigment) Artificial Cerulean #006594 0 101 148 199° 100% 29% Gallego & Sanz Ceruleo Sustituto Dark Cerulean #08457E 8 69 126 209° 88% 26% ==Related pages== * List of colors ==References==",
