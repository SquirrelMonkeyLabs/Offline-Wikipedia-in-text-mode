Hawpa was established on the first day of Nowruz in 2020. Hawpa has undertaken a campaign to promote their belief that Arabs should be expelled from the Kurdistan Region, while Turkmen and Assyrians should be subject to genocide. ==Ideology== Hawpa claims its ideology belongs to the Third Position and strives for the establishment of a corporatist state. Hawpa's ideology has its origins in the Hîwa Party (1939 – 1946) and the Kajik Party (1959 – 1975), which were founded on the basis of fascist and Nazi ideas. In addition, the ideology also refers to former Kurdish politicians and figures such as Ramzi Nafi Agha and Rafiq Hilmi. ==History== The party gained initial recognition subsequent to their active participation in the 2022 Nowruz festival held in Diyarbakir. During the festival, they prominently brandished flags depicting their flag, along with flags adorned with the portraits of Qazi Muhammad and Ramzi Nafi Agha. There were reports indicating their perpetration of assaults targeting Turkish communists and members of the LGBT community. ==Related pages== * Fascism * Antisemitism * Islam and fascism ==References== Category:Racism Category:Fascism Category:Middle East Category:Political movements",
