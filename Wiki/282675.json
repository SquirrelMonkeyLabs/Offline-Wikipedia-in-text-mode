Today, there are more than 44,000 Subway locations in 112 countries across the world, making it the world's largest fast food restaurant chain by number of stores. It has more stores than McDonald's, but McDonald's earns more revenue than Subway. Since 2007, Subway has consistently ranked in Entrepreneur Magazines' top 500 franchise list.
