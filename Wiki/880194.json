 "text": "Cruziohyla is a genus of frogs in the family Phyllomedusidae. They live in Honduras in Central America down to the Amazon Basin in South America. Scientists first decided to put frogs in this genus in 2005 when they were reexamining the way they organized frogs in the Hylidae. Cruziohyla was fully reviewed in 2018. The species in this genus were in Agalychnis and Phyllomedusa before. These frogs have a lot of webbing on their front and back feet. Their eyes have two colors in their irises. Tadpoles grow in water- filled holes in fallen trees. The name Cruziohyla is for the Brazilian amphibian scientist Carlos Alberto Gonçalves da Cruz. ==Species== There are three Cruziohyla species: * Cruziohyla calcarifer (Boulenger, 1902) — splendid leaf frog * Cruziohyla craspedopus (Funkhouser, 1957) — fringe tree frog * Cruziohyla sylviae (Gray, 2018) — Sylvia's tree frog ==References== ==Other websites== *Amphibian Species of the World Category:Frogs of South America",
