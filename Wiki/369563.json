Common colors are orange and red, but white, brown, and pink habanero chilis are also seen. Typically a ripe habanero chili is long. Habanero chilis are very spicy; they are rated 100,000â€“350,000 on the Scoville scale. The habanero chili comes from the Amazon basin. From there, it was spread in Mexico. The habanero is a perennial flowering plant. With proper care and growing conditions, it can produce flowers (and thus fruit) for many years. ==References== Category:Capsicum Category:Belizean food Category:Mexican food",
