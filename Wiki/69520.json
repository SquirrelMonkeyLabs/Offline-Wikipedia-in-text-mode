Its job is to protect and expand Britain's forests and woodlands and increase their value to society and the environment. Some of its forests are pine trees which the commission manages and carefully cuts down trees for wood and paper making. The money from this helps the commission to maintain it other forests which are not farmed but which are used for recreation, by people wanting to visit the countryside, and also to fund some scientific research into the ways to grow trees and to keep them healthy. The Forestry Commission looks after a lot of the forests in the list of Forests in the United Kingdom Category:Departments of the United Kingdom Government Category:Government agencies of the United Kingdom Category:Forests of the United Kingdom Category:Forestry",
