 "text": "Homo is a genus of upright primates that walk on two legs. The only living species in this genus is Homo sapiens: modern humans. == Ancestry == The genus began about 2.3 million years ago. Its ancestors were almost certainly some line of Australopithecine apes. Compared to them, species of Homo have: #A larger brain (above 900ml) #Improved walking and running ability. == Evolution == As the genus evolved, the forehead became more vertical, the skull became rounder, the teeth got smaller, the arms got shorter and the legs got longer. The skeleton became more delicate, particularly in our species. All Homo species used stone tools, but there is no evidence of when language developed. Human evolution remains a much-studied topic.Alexander, Richard D. 1990. How did humans evolve? Reflections on the uniquely unique species. Special Publication.
