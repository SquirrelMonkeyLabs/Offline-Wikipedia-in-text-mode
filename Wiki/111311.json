The level of preservation is such that it is a main part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney. This is one of four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Scotland, the others being the Old Town and New Town of Edinburgh; New Lanark in South Lanarkshire; and St Kilda in the Western Isles. == Discovery and features == Until 1850, Skara Brae lay under years of soil sediment when in the winter of that year a large storm stripped the grass from the large mound known as Skerrabra. The outline of several of stone buildings was revealed and initial excavations were undertaken by William Watt, the laird of Skaill. It was fully excavated between 1928 and 1930 by Vere Gordon Childe following another storm in 1926. == Related pages == *Heart of Neolithic Orkney *St Kilda *Edinburgh Old & New towns *New Lanark *The Antonine Wall is the most northerly part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site, shared with England (Hadrian's Wall) and Germany (Limes Germanicus). ==References== ==Other websites== *Historic Scotland Official Website *Orkneyjar Category:Neolithic Category:World Heritage Sites in the United Kingdom Category:Prehistoric buildings and structures on Orkney Category:4th millennium BC buildings and structures",
