 "text": "The Crosby–Schøyen Codex (MS 193; Crosby Codex, Mississippi Coptic Codex I, or the Savery Codex) is a biblical manuscript written in Coptic on papyrus. By comparative writing styles (palaeography), it has been dated to 3rd-century CE. The manuscript comes from Alexandria. The codex consists of 104 pages (52 leaves), and contains the earliest surviving whole copies of the Book of Jonah and 1 Peter; It also contains Peri Pascha, part of 2 Maccabees (5:27 to 7:41), and an Easter homily. It is considered an early example of the transition from scroll to codex. == References == Category:3rd-century biblical manuscripts",
