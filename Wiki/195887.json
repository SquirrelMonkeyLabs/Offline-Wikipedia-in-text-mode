 "text": "Women's suffrage (the right to vote) in the United States started slowly, at state and local levels, during the 19th Century and early 20th Century, ending in 1920 with the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provided: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\" ==Beginnings== Lydia Chapin (Taft) (d. 1778) was a starter of women's suffrage movement in Colonial America. She was the first woman legally allowed to vote in colonial America. After the death of her wealthy husband and elder son, the family was left without an adult Heir apparent. She was given this right by the town meeting of Uxbridge, Massachusetts in 1756. For the great majority of American women, voting rights for women were not granted until much later on. In 1915, the Justice Bell was taken on a trip, and it was showed, in all 67 Pennsylvania counties, on the bed of a modified pickup truck; The trip was 5,000 miles long; It has been called a \"suffrage awareness tour\". ==Recognition of important people== Because Susan B. Anthony was important, the United States made a coin; The Susan B. Anthony dollar is a United States dollar coin; It was made (or minted) from 1979 to 1981. == References == Category:History of the United States Category:Women's suffrage",
