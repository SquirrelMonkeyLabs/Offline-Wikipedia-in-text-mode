 "text": "N'Golo Kanté (; born 29 March 1991) is a French football player. He plays for Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad and the French National Team. He made his name in the English Premier League with Leicester City. They won the league on 2015/16, largely because his tackles in midfield and passes to Jamie Vardy created so many goals. Chelsea bought him next year (2016–17) for £32 million, and they also won the league that year. Since then opposing sides have adjusted to his particular skills, and he has been somewhat less successful. Nevertheless, his performance has been extraordinary as a midfielder only 5'6\" tall in an era where most defenders are much taller. Kanté made his senior international debut for France in 2016. In 2017 Kanté was named the French Player of the Year, a first for a player from the Premier League in seven years. 12 months later he was a key member of the 2018 FIFA World Cup winning squad. == Personal life == Kanté's parents moved to France in 1980 from the African country of Mali 11 years before his birth. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National cup League cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Boulogne 2011–12 Ligue 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 — — 1 0 2012–13 Championnat National 37 3 2 1 0 0 — — 39 4 Total 38 3 2 1 0 0 — — 40 4 Caen 2013–14 Ligue 2 38 2 4 1 1 0 — — 43 3 2014–15 Ligue 1 37 2 1 1 1 0 — — 39 3 Total 75 4 5 2 2 0 — — 82 6 Leicester City 2015–16 Premier League 37 1 1 0 2 0 — — 40 1 Chelsea 2016–17 Premier League 35 1 5 1 1 0 — — 41 2 2017–18 Premier League 34 1 5 0 2 0 6 0 1 0 48 1 2018–19 Premier League 36 4 2 0 5 1 10 0 0 0 53 5 2019–20 Premier League 22 3 1 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 28 3 2020–21 Premier League 30 0 4 0 1 0 13 0 — 48 0 2021–22 Premier League 26 2 3 0 4 0 6 0 3 0 42 2 2022–23 Premier League 7 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 — 9 0 Total 190 11 20 1 13 1 41 0 5 0 269 13 Al-Ittihad 2023–24 Saudi Pro League 25 2 3 1 — 6 0 6 1 40 4 Career total 365 21 31 5 17 1 47 0 11 1 471 28 ===International=== Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals France 2016 13 1 2017 7 0 2018 16 0 2019 3 0 2020 5 1 2021 7 0 2022 2 0 Total 53 2 :France score listed first, score column indicates score after each Kanté goal List of international goals scored by N'Golo Kanté No. Date Venue Cap Opponent Score Result Competition 1 29 March 2016 Stade de France, Saint- Denis, France 2 1–0 4–2 Friendly 2 14 November 2020 Estádio da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal 44 1–0 1–0 2020–21 UEFA Nations League A ==Honours== Leicester City *Premier League: 2015–16 Chelsea *Premier League: 2016–17 *FA Cup: 2017–18; runner-up: 2016–17, 2019–20, 2020–21, 2021–22 *UEFA Champions League: 2020–21 *UEFA Europa League: 2018–19 *UEFA Super Cup: 2021 *FIFA Club World Cup: 2021 *EFL Cup runner-up: 2018–19, 2021–22 France *FIFA World Cup: 2018 *UEFA Nations League: 2020–21 *UEFA European Championship runner-up: 2016 Individual *PFA Team of the Year: 2015–16 Premier League, 2016–17 Premier League *ESM Team of the Year: 2015–16, 2016–17 *Leicester City Players' Player of the Year: 2015–16 *L'Équipe Team of the Year: 2016, 2017, 2018 *PFA Players' Player of the Year: 2016–17 *Premier League Player of the Season: 2016–17 *FWA Footballer of the Year: 2016–17 *Chelsea Players' Player of the Year: 2016–17 *Chelsea Player of the Year: 2017–18 *UNFP Best French Player Playing Abroad: 2017, 2018 *French Player of the Year: 2017 *FIFA FIFPro World11: 2018, 2021 *UEFA Team of the Year: 2018 *UEFA Europa League Squad of the Season: 2018–19 *UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season: 2020–21 *UEFA Champions League Midfielder of the Season: 2020–21 Orders *Knight of the Legion of Honour: 2018 == References == Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Paris Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Leicester City F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:UEFA Euro 2016 players Category:2018 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2024 players",
