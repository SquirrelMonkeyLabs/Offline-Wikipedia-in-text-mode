 "text": "Goodie Mob is an American hip hop group that was formed in 1991 by Cameron \"Big Gipp\" Gipp, Willie \"Khujo\" Knighton Jr., CeeLo Green (born Thomas Callaway), and Robert \"T-Mo\" Barnett in Atlanta, Georgia. The group's first studio album was Soul Food (1995). The album contained social and political issues such as racism, discrimination, geopolitics, and gentrification. The album's first single \"Cell Therapy\" reached number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart. In 1998, Goodie Mob released their second album Still Standing. The album continued the group's style of social commentary. CeeLo's singing abilities have been used more often. Their third album, 'World Party']', has moved away from its gritty (hard-edged) style. It instead incorporated lighter beats and party related subject matter. During the production of the album, CeeLo left the group for a solo career when he was unhappy with the direction of the project. After Goodie Mob's fourth album, One Monkey Don't Stop No Show, was released in 2004, Big Gipp also left the group. In 2006, all four members of Goodie Mob reunited and performed together following a concert by Gnarls Barkley. In 2011, Goodie Mob signed with Elektra Records. Their new album Age Against the Machine was released in 2013. After a seven years gap, they released a new album in November 2020, titled Survival Kit. == References == Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Musical groups from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American rap music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:Musical groups from Atlanta",
