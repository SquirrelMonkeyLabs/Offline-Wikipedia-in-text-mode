These means people under 18 cannot look at, buy or rent any movie under this rating. Movies with such a rating often have very strong language, explicit sexual content or heavy violence. If the content of the movie is higher than the 18 rating, the movie is then banned entirely. ==Australia== Refused Classification is the very strongest rating in Australia. This rating means a movie has been banned from a part of Australia. In some cases, it has been banned in all of the country.
