Twenty-five children were present at the workshop. The attacker stabbed eleven children and two adults. Two girls died at the scene. Six of the injured children and both adults were in critical condition when taken to hospital, and a third girl died the following day. On 30 July, far-right protesters clashed with police in Southport. They had false informatioon about the attackers identity. They damaged a mosque. Over the next few days, protests and riots spread nationwide. So far, no motive for the attack has been given. The police said that they were not treating the incident as terrorism. On 1 August, Liverpool Crown Court disclosed Rudakubana's identity – despite his still being a minor at that point – to counter speculation and misinformation.
