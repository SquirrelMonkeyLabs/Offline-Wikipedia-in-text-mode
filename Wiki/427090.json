 "text": "The NXT Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling tag team championship in the WWE. The title is an NXT-only championship. ==History== The title was presented by special guest Shawn Michaels on the January 23, 2013 edition of NXT. He announced that there would be a tournament held to crown the first champions. A team called British Ambition (whose members were Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey) beat a team called The Wyatt Family (Luke Harper and Erick Rowan) to become the first champions on January 31, 2013 (but it could not be watched on TV until February 13). In their first match for the title, Neville and Bo Dallas fought the Wyatt Family because Grey was hurt badly and could not fight. Neville and Dallas lost. Neville and Corey Graves beat the Wyatt Family for the titles on June 20 (shown on TV on July 17) and Neville became the first wrestler to win the title twice. At NXT TakeOver: The End in June 2016, The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson) became the first team to win the title twice by beating American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan). ==Reigns== Right now, the champions are Hank Walker and Tank Ledger, who are in their first reign, both as a team and individually. They won the title by defeating previous champions Fraxiom Nathan Frazer and Axiom at Stand & Deliver on April 19, 2025, in Paradise, Nevada. {{PWtitlereign |number = 38 |champion = Nathan Frazer and Axiom |reign = 2 |date = |days = ==Combined reigns== As of , . † Is the current champion ===By team=== Rank Team No. of reigns Combined days Combined days rec. by WWE 1 3 2 1 364 343 3 FraxiomNathan Frazer and Axiom † 2 4 2 326 306 5 Imperium 2 263 262 6 (Wesley) Blake and (Buddy) Murphy 1 219 205 7 2 208 207 8 1 203 202 9 2 177 10 Gallus 1 176 175 11 1 153 152 12 2 150 149 13 1 126 139 14 1 102 123 15 1 95 109 16 1 92 91 17 1 91 83 18 1 87 86 19 Adrian Neville and Corey Graves 1 84 76 20 1 75 88 21 1 70 69 22 1 68 67 23 1 61 81 24 1 56 56 24 The New Day 1 56 56 24 Bron Breakker and Baron Corbin 1 56 55 27 1 49 69 28 Chase U 2 40 40 29 Hank and Tank † 1 + 30 1 2 22 ===By wrestler=== Rank Wrestler No. of reigns Combined days Combined days rec. by WWE 1 3 606 550 2 2 387 352 3 1 364 343 3 1 364 343 5 2 7 2 326 306 7 2 326 306 9 2 288 378 10 2 263 12 1 219 205 12 1 219 205 14 2 208 207 14 208 207 16 1 203 202 16 1 203 202 18 2 177 20 1 176 175 22 2 175 159 23 1 153 152 25 2 150 149 27 1 126 139 27 1 126 139 29 1 102 123 29 1 102 123 31 1 95 109 1 95 109 33 1 92 91 33 1 35 1 91 83 36 1 87 86 36 1 87 86 38 1 84 76 39 1 75 88 41 1 70 69 41 1 70 69 43 1 68 67 43 1 68 67 45 1 61 81 45 1 61 81 47 1 56 56 47 1 56 56 47 1 56 56 47 1 56 56 47 1 56 55 47 1 56 55 53 1 49 69 53 1 49 69 55 2 40 40 56 1 21 21 57 1 19 19 58 † 1 + 58 † 60 1 4 180 61 1 2 22 61 1 2 22 == Notes == == References == == Other websites == * Official NXT Tag Team Championship title history * Category:World Wrestling Entertainment championships Category:2013 establishments in the United States",
