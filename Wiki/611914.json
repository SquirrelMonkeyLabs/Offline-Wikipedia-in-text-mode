 "text": "There are 4 arrondissements in the Haut-Rhin department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of Haut-Rhin are: Arrondissements of Haut-Rhin INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 681 Altkirch Altkirch 69,645 663.1 108 682 Colmar- Ribeauvillé Colmar 200,243 1,127.3 98 684 Mulhouse Mulhouse 350,032 707.1 79 686 Thann-Guebwiller Thann 140,214 1,027.7 81 ==History== Haut-Rhin is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was divided in three districts: Altkirch, Belfort and Colmar, with Colmar as is capital. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the three districts were changed into five arrondissements: Colmar, Altkirch, Belfort, Delémont and Porrentruy. The arrondissements Delémont and Porrentruy were eliminated in 1814 and transferred to Switzerland. The subprefecture of Altkirch was moved to Mulhouse in 1857. The Haut-Rhin department was eliminated in 1871 when the territory became part of Germany except for a part that forms the Territoire de Belfort. In 1919, Haut-Rhin is again an department when the territory became part of France with the arrondissements Colmar-Ville, Colmar-Campagne, Altkirch, Guebwiller, Mulhouse, Ribeauvillé and Thann. Its capital is Colmar. The arrondissements Colmar-Ville and Colmar-Campagne were combined in 1934 to form the arrondissement of Colmar. The arrondissement of Guebwiller was eliminated in 2015 and its territory combined with Tharn to form the arrondissement of Thann-Guebwiller. In that same year, the arrondissement of Ribeauvillé was also eliminated and its territory combined with Colmar to form the arrondissement of Colmar- Ribeauvillé.Décret n° 2014-1720 du 29 décembre 2014 portant suppression des arrondissements de Guebwiller et de Ribeauvillé (département du Haut-Rhin) ==Related pages== * List of arrondissements of France ==References== Haut-Rhin",
