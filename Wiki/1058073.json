The city area also includes four settlements: Gulshat, Sayak, Saryshagan and Shashubai. ==History== ===Early history=== Copper was found the area in 1928. This led to the city being built. Small settlements for workers were built around the Balkhash mining and metallurgical plant. On April 11, 1937, Balkhash became a city. The plan of the city was designed by the Leningrad Research and Design Institute of Urban Planning. People from all over the Soviet Union took part in the construction of the city and the copper plant. The Balkhash construction project was then called the “Balkhash Giant”, and it was prestigious to work on the construction. This can be confirmed by the words of the first secretary of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR, Levon Mirzoyan: > “Years will pass, the construction of the Balkhash giant will end, and a > person who says that he spent five years on this construction site will be > treated with great respect. Anyone who works on Balkhash , earns an > honorable position in the country\". On January 12, 1936, the first house with a large number of floors for living was built in the city. A significant part of the workers moved to comfortable apartments. For the period from 1938 to 1941, the government invested 550 million Soviet rubles in the construction of the city, of which 122 millions were for the construction of houses for living. The city began to develop very fast. In the 1940s, about 40,000 people lived in this city.

Several bus routes were opened throughout the city. ===Great Patriotic War=== On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the territory of the USSR, this became the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. During the Great Patriotic War (the Russian name for World War II), most of the men went to war and women replaced them at the copper factory. 11,532 people of Balkhash fought during the war. A system of distributing goods by cards was introduced. There was a shortage of goods in the country. Residents of the city were given cards for bread, sugar and other goods.
