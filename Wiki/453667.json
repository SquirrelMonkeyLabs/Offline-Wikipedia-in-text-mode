 "text": "Oppositional defiant disorder is a mental disorder. It causes irritable and angry behaviour for at least 6 months. This behavior is noticeable in communication with other people. Most people with ODD do not usually get aggressive towards other people or animals, steal, or cause destruction. This is different from people with conduct disorder. But people with ODD do argue, and they often deliberately cause trouble. ==Symptoms== To be diagnosed with ODD, the person must have a behavior pattern for at least six months. At least four of these eight symptoms must be there in that time: *Often argues with adults *Goes against adults' requests and rules *Deliberately annoys other people *Blames other people for things they themselves have done wrong *Angry and resentful of other people *Spiteful/seeks revenge *Gets annoyed easily About 10.2% of people have or have had ODD (11.2% of males and 9.2% of females). In many cases this condition worsens into conduct disorder, which often worsens into antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). This is more likely in boys than girls, and more likely if the person also has ADHD. ODD typically begins in childhood. It is the most common mental disorder in children. It is unusual in adults, because the affected person usually either recovers or develops Antisocial personality disorder ODD is more common in family members of people who have ODD, CD or ASPD. It is more common in poor urban areas. Most people who have ODD also have other mental disorders, most often ADHD. Many children who have ODD have problems with alcohol and drugs in their adolescence and adulthood. == References == Category:Mental illnesses",
