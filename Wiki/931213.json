 "text": "Parliament Square has the Palace of Westminster. It is in the City of Westminster in central London. It was laid out in the mid-19th century. It has a large open green area in the centre. The Square is one of London's main tourist attractions. It has official buildings: the Houses of Parliament, and the Palace of Westminster. There are civil service executive offices to the north (on Whitehall). The Supreme Court) is to the west, and Westminster Abbey to the south. The crowding together of Parliament, government and law is deliberate. It makes it possible to walk from one place to another. This helps the various parts of government to co-operate. Unfortunately, the arrangement also attracts protestors, and even criminal assaults. Protesting is controversial, and has been tested in law.\"Parliament Square protesters lose eviction appeal â€“ BBC News\".
