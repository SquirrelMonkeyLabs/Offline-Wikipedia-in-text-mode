 "text": "The Yapitya rocket frog (Hyloxalus exasperatus) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 17.5–20.1 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 20.7–21.2 mm. The adult female frog has a white belly and the adult male frog has a spots on its belly. This frog has stripes on its sides. The male frog's male frogs are white in color. ==Name== Scientists named this frog exasperatus after the feeling exasperation: They got tired of waiting for scientist Stephen R. Edwards to finish writing his paper about the genus Colostethus. It took fifteen years. ==Home== This frog lives in rainy forests and cloud forests that are not too high up in the mountains. People have seen this frog between 970 and 1981 meters above sea level. Scientists found some of these frogs in one protected park: Bosque Protector Cordillera Kutuku-Shaimi. ==Young== Scientists think the frog has young the same way many other frogs in Hyloxalus do: the female frog lays eggs on the ground and the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Scientists found it in the 1980s but have not seen it since then, even though they went to its home to look for it and saw different frogs. Scientists say this frog might be all dead today. They say there are 250 or fewer of these frogs alive today, not 50 or fewer in any one place. This frog is is in danger because people change the places where it lives to make farms, get wood to build with, and dig gold and copper out of the ground. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
