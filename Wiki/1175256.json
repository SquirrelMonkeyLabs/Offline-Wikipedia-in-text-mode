Its population in 2024 was 252. == Location == It lies in a southeastern valley basin of the Prešov–Tokaj Mountains, along road 3718; its average altitude above sea level is 140 meters. == History == The village’s name reminds us that from the mid-14th century, gold and silver were mined in its area. The Slavic word \"Ruda\" also means ore mining. In the early 1700s, Rusyn settlers came here. In 1851, Elek Fényes described it as a Rusyn- Hungarian village. After the mine ran out, people had to farm the land. The biggest landowner was Prince Trautsohn, with 15 serfs. According to the 1844 land register, the serfs’ inner plots covered 36 acres, farmland 485 acres, meadows 104 acres, and pastures 365 acres. The biggest landowner then was József Fodor, with 19 serfs. In the 19th century, farmland grew because of land clearing. Most people (84%) worked in farming, and small or tiny plots were common. Most people here are Greek Catholic, and until 1959, their church services were in Old Church Slavonic. Their church, built in 1774, has a front tower, supporting pillars, a four-section nave, and a semi-circular sanctuary. The tower was added in 1888. In 1881, 453 people said their native language was Slovak, 21 said Rusyn, and 19 said Hungarian. In 1910, 569 said Slovak and 71 said Hungarian. In 1940, due to political pressure (like population exchanges), 84% of people said they were Hungarian, but they still used Slovak in daily life for many decades and still do. People here still speak a type of eastern Slovak language that includes Slovak and Rusyn elements. Older people use it every day, and younger people use it when talking to the elderly, keeping their ancestors’ language alive. In 1981 the village was annexed to the town of Sátoraljaújhely. == Notes == Category:Settlements in Borsod-Abaúj- Zemplén County Category:Villages in Hungary",
