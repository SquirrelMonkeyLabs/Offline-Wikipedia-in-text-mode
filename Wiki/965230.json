 "text": "The Nadir crater is an undersea feature on the Guinea Plateau in the Atlantic Ocean. It is off the coast of Guinea. It is thought to be an impact crater. The feature is around 8.5-km-wide. The paper announcing the discovery of the feature was published in Science Advances in 2022.It was formed at or near the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene boundary about 66 million years ago, around the same time as the Chicxulub crater. It has been suggested that the structure should be drilled to confirm or disprove the impact origin. == References == Category:Atlantic Ocean Category:Impact craters",
