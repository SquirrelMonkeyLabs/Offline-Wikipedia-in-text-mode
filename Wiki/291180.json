 "text": "Sports Illustrated Stadium, known before December 2024 as Red Bull Arena, is a soccer stadium in Harrison, New Jersey in the United States. It is home to two teams that each play in the top level of American soccerâ€”the New York Red Bulls, a men's team playing in Major League Soccer, and NJ/NY Gotham FC, which plays in the National Women's Soccer League. The construction started in 2006, but through differences of the clubowner and the state of New Jersey there was a delay. After the former Metro Stars were bought by the Red Bull company, the stadium was opened on March 20, 2010 with a friendly match of the NY Red Bulls versus FC Santos from Brazil. One week later the first league match was held in the new stadium versus Chicago Fire. The stadium has 30 luxury suites and 1,000 premium seats. The design is customized to the design of the owner company, Red Bull. On December 11, 2024, the Red Bulls announced that the stadium would be renamed Sports Illustrated Stadium. The renaming is part of a partnership between the team and Sports Illustrated Tickets, an online ticketing platform that licenses the name of the famed magazine from the magazine's owner. ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Other websites== *Red Bull Arena Homepage *See also:Red Bull Arena (Salzburg) Category:Soccer stadiums in the United States Category:2010 establishments in New Jersey",
