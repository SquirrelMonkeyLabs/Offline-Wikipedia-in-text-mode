 "text": "The epidermis is the skin or surface layer of an animal or plant. At its most basic, it is a sheet of cells. The cells are continually replaced by cell division (mitosis), and the layer (in animals) is sensitive to stimuli such as touch. In land vertebrates the epidermis has many layers; the outer layers may be reinforced by keratin. ==Related pages== * Skin * Epidermis (botany) * Epidermis (zoology) Category:Integumentary system",
