Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark. His father was a shoemaker, and his mother washed clothes for customers. The family was poor. When Andersen was 11, his father died. At 14, Andersen left his mother and his home. He moved to Copenhagen. The king helped Andersen finish his education. Andersen wanted to be an actor or dancer. He did not have the talent for either. He started to write novels, plays, poems, short stories, and travel books. In 1835, he published four fairy tales that were liked by the readers. After this success, he wanted to write more fairy tales. Andersen's stories were popular all over Europe. He was invited into the homes of rich and powerful people. He fell in love with several men and women. He was in love with singer Jenny Lind. He also fell in love with ballet dancer Harald Scharff. Andersen was a happy and carefree man. He travelled all over Europe. He wanted to see the sights. He hoped travelling would make him even happier. He always carried a rope with him. He planned to use this rope as a fire escape if needed. In the spring of 1872, Andersen fell off of his bed and suffered major injuries. He never recovered fully. Soon after that, Andersen showed signs of liver cancer. He died on 4 August 1875 from liver cancer. == Works == * The Princess and the Pea (1835) * The Tinderbox (1835) * Thumbelina (1835) * The Little Mermaid (1837) * The Emperor's New Clothes (1837) * The Steadfast Tin Soldier (1838) * The Wild Swans (1838) * Ole Lukøje (1841) * The Swineherd (1841) * The Angel (1843) * The Nightingale (1843) * The Ugly Duckling (1843) * The Little Match Girl (1845) * The Red Shoes (1845) * The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep (1845) * The Snow Queen (1845) * The Fir Tree (1845) * The Shadow (1847) * The Story of a Mother (1847) * The Marsh King's Daughter (?) ==Related pages== *List of Danish writers ==References== Category:1805 births Category:1875 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Bisexual people Category:Children's writers Category:Danish poets Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Cancer deaths in Denmark Category:LGBT writers Category:Danish novelists Category:Odense",
