 "text": "Treehouse of Horror, or The Simpsons Halloween Specials, is a seasonal special TV episode that is aired in every season (except the first one) where there are three different Halloween-based stories. Most of the time the episodes are about something really scary, unusual, or science-fictional event happening to the family. Since they have nothing to do with the real episodes, they are considered non-canonical (things that do not really happen). Most of the time the family encounter horrible things like zombies, aliens, monsters, witches, or sometimes each other. Some episodes spoof horror or science-fiction films (most notably, shows from The Twilight Zone). ==Related pages== *List of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episodes ==Other websites== *Top 10 Treehouse of Horror Segments on IGN.com *Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror #13 Comic Preview on ComicsAlliance.com Category:The Simpsons",
