 "text": "A stereotype is a mistaken idea or belief many people have about a thing or group that is based upon how they look on the outside, which may be untrue or only partly true. Stereotyping is often seen as a form of prejudice because how someone looks on the outside is only a small part of who they are on the inside. In fiction and jokes, stereotypes are sometimes used to be funny. But like other false beliefs about race, stereotypes are part of racial stories that keep people with less power down, so the powerful group can stay on top and get better jobs and more money. The term was invented in the late 18th century for a method of printing.Twyman M. 1970. Printing 17701970: an illustrated history of its development and uses in England. London: Eyre & spottiswoode. In the mid-19th century it meant the faithful reproduction of everything which could be printed, whether words or pictures. It made the printing of cheap editions possible, and was used in printing newspapers. The term got its psychological meaning in the 20th century. == Related pages == *Gender role *Stereotype threat *Women and video games == References == Category:Psychology Category:Social issues Category:Printing",
