 "text": "Savage's brook frog (Duellmanohyla lythrodes) is a frog. It lives in Costa Rica and Panama, in the Cordillera de Talamanca. Scientists have only seen it between 170 and 440 meters above sea level. As of 2009, scientists had seen exactly three of these frogs. The adult male frog is about 30-33 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 30-36 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is green or brown. There is a white stripe from the nose to where the legs meet the body. There is a white spot under each eye. The skin on the belly is yellow. The throat is white. The iris of the eye is red in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were. Human beings change the places where it lives. They cut down trees for wood and to make farms and towns and places for cows and other animals to eat grass. Human beings build dams that change the way the water moves. Diseases can also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
