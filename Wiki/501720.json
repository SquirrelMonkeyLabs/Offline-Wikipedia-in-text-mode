 "text": "Scarborough is a coastal suburb on the northern beaches of Perth, Western Australia. Scarborough Beach is a popular beach in Western Australia. The beach has white sand made of sea shells and limestone. This makes the sand fine, not coarse. There is seaweed and reefs further out into the ocean waters. To the south is Brighton Beach, and further to the north is Trigg Beach. Scarborough has full-time surfing and lifeguard volunteers present, throughout the warm and hot summer months. == References == Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia",
