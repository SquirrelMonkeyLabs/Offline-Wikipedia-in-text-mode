 "text": "Red is a programming language made to improve upon the older Rebol programming language. It can be used for both high and low level programming. Red was created by Nenad Rakočević in 2011. ==Some technical details== Red has two parts, Red/System and Red: * Red/System is a lower language that has a similar purpose to C, but uses a different syntax. * Red is a higher language and interpreted, used for general-purpose tasks. The language is able to cross- compile. Red applications can run on many different operating systems. At this time, Red applications are 32-bit, but it is planned to switch to 64-bit in the future. Red uses a garbage collector \"the Simple GC\". == Examples == Here is a hello world program in Red. Hello World! Red [Title: \"Simple hello world script\"] print \"Hello World!\" Here is an example of using a variable: * To bind a word to a value, use a colon. Red [] name: \"John\" print name Here are examples of conditionals in Red. >> if 10 > 5 [print \"large\"] large >> unless 10 > 5 [print \"large\"] == none >> unless 5 > 10 [print \"large\"] large >> either 10 > 5 [print \"bigger\"] [print \"smaller\"] bigger >> either 5 > 10 [print \"bigger\"] [print \"smaller\"] smaller ==References== == Further reading == * ==Other websites== * Red's website * Red's newest downloads * Red Programming Language on GitHub * Redprogramming.com * Helpin' Red Category:Programming languages Category:Cross-platform software Category:Multi-paradigm programming languages",
