 "text": "Achelousaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur first described by paleontologist D. Scott Sampson in 1995, based on its fossil remains discovered in Montana (USA), in North America. The scientific name Achelousaurus horneri was chosen in honor of the American paleontologist Jack Horner. A skull of an adult Achelousaurus dinosaur is on display at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. In terms of its impressive appearance, this prehistoric animal is very similar to the dinosaur Pachyrhinosaurus and the dinosaur Einiosaurus - both were herbivores and lived in forested areas, and their obvious hair ornaments were intended to attract females during the rut. Achelousaurus had the shield on the back of the head very well developed, provided with two slits that greatly reduced its weight. Above the eyes it had two bony protrusions, and on the nose instead of the curved horn (which appears in Einiosaurus) it had another elongated bony protrusion. Category:Dinosaurs",
