 "text": "The Panzer V (known as the \"Panther\") was armed with the 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70. It was made in response to the T-34, and had angled armour much more capable of bouncing rounds off then its predecessor, the Panzer IV and the Tiger I. It had interleaved road wheels much like the Tiger I, being much cheaper than its counterparts, but the trade-off was that it had weaker side-armour and worse High-Explosive ammunition. It, however, was unreliable, much like its other German counterparts. It served untill the end of fall of Nazi Germany. == References == Category:Military of Germany Category:Tanks",
