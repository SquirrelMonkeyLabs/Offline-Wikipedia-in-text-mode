 "text": "Diego Armando Maradona (30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional footballer and manager. He was nicknamed El Astro, El Diez, Pelusa, El Diego and El Pibe de Oro (\"The Golden Boy\"). He is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. He has often been compared to Brazilian legend Pelé; both were winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th century award. Maradona made 91 appearances and scored 34 goals with Argentina. He played at four World Cups. His greatest and most important achievement was winning the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades and led the club to Serie A title wins twice. In 1983, he became the first Barcelona player to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu, a feat later achieved by Brazilian legend Ronaldinho in 2005. ==Club career== Maradona made his professional debut with Argentina on 20 October 1976 wearing the number 16 shirt, a week before his 16th birthday. He scored his first goal in November 1976 two weeks after turning 16. In 1981, he transferred to Boca Juniors, and won the league title with them that same year. His performances at the 1982 FIFA World Cup attracted the interest of FC Barcelona, and they signed him shortly after the tournament. ===1984 Copa Del Rey=== In the 1984 Copa Del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao, Maradona was involved in a fight with several other Bilbao players. During the game, Bilbao player Andoni Goikoetxea made a rough tackle on Maradona, and Bilbao fans insulted Maradona and his family. This made him very angry. Barca lost 1-0, and when he was insulted by Miguel Sola at the end of the match, Maradona lost control and became furious. He headbutted Sola, kneed Bilbao's goalie in the head, elbowed another one in the face, and kicked and punched other players as well. This ended up being his last game with the Catalan club. Maradona signed for Napoli in the summer of 1984 for around €8 million. At his presentation, he was greeted by 75,000 fans at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. He led the club to its first Serie A title in 1987. That same year, he won the Coppa Italia. For the 1987-88 season, Maradona was top scorer of the league, with 15 goals. Napoli also finished second in the league to A.C. Milan. In the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against VfB Stuttgart, Maradona played an important role in Napoli's victory. He scored and assisted Careca's goal in the 2-1 victory during the first leg. In the second leg, he assisted Ciro Ferrara's goal in a 3-3 draw (5-4 on aggregate). The following year, Napoli won the Supercoppa Italiana with a 5-1 demolishing of Juventus. ===1990s=== In March 1991, Maradona failed a drug test for cocaine. He was given a 15-month ban and a fine, so he missed the rest of the 1990-91 season and the entire 1991-92 season. After being allowed to return to football in June 1992, he didn't want to return to Napoli, and he asked for a transfer. He eventually signed for Spanish club Sevilla. He stayed there for one year. He moved back to the Argentine League with Newell's Old Boys in 1993, and stayed there for one season. Maradona ended his career by making a return to Boca Juniors in 1995. He stayed there for two years until retiring on 25 October 1997. He played his last match against Boca's rival River Plate, and Boca won 2-1. ==International career== Maradona played his first match for the Argentina national team on 27 February 1977 against Hungary, as a 16 year old. Maradona is most famously known for his performance against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter final, where he scored two legendary goals. The first one was controversially scored with his hand. It started with a poor clearance from an English defender that sent the ball into the penalty box. As goalkeeper Peter Shilton came off his line to challenge the ball, Maradona jumped and punched it in past Shilton, while also adding a movement as if he hit the ball with his head that fooled the referees. He later called it the \"Hand of God\", and said that he used his hand because he knew he was not going to reach the ball. The second one was voted the best goal scored in World Cup history in 2002 and many people call it the \"Goal of the Century\", where he received the ball behind the half-field line and dribbled five England players before juking out goalkeeper Shilton and passing the ball with his left foot into the open net from 6 yards out. The match ended 2-1 in favor of Argentina. Argentina won the World Cup after defeating West Germany in the final, and Maradona was named as the tournament's best player. The British named him \"athlete of the decade.\" == Legacy == Diego Maradona is often considered the best due to his remarkable influence both on and off the field. His unique talent, iconic moments, and cultural significance have left a lasting impact. Brescia et al. (2023) explain, “Maradona’s importance as a cultural icon deserves a more systematic inquiry.” His influence goes beyond football, touching on art, politics, and religion. Maradona's legacy also encompasses his controversies, which only added to his larger-than-life image, solidifying his status as a global icon in sports and popular culture. Maradona’s influence went beyond his artistic brilliance. His ability to captivate audiences was rooted not only in his playing style, but also in his rebellious and defiant spirit, most notably when he scored twice against England in the 1986 World Cup. Remarkably, both goals have become famous and have been given a distinctive name. The second goal was called the ‘cosmic kite’ according to Salazar et al. (2008), “In the second goal, Maradona weaved his way through the entire England defence in an outstanding solo move that became known as the ‘cosmic kite’ (el barrilete cósmico)”. While the first goal, scored with his famous hand, reflects the complexity of his personality, where genius is mixed with controversy. The goal was called the Hand of God, according to Salazar et al. (2008), Maradona described his (in)famous handball as ‘something that came from deep inside, having done it in the wasteground (potrero), having done it in Fiorito’ (Quoted in La Noche del 10, my translation)\". Furthermore, Maradona fed the international press with a timeless soundbite: ‘the Hand of God’, which was to magnify the message of England’s humiliation way beyond the football pitch\". These moments helped to showcase different aspects of his unique personality, making him considered by many to be the best footballer of all time and enhancing his iconic status in football. == Personal life == === Health problems === Maradona was addicted to cocaine from the mid-1980s until 2004. During his time at Napoli, he failed a drug test in 1991 and had his conversations wiretapped by police. He was also accused of working with the Italian mafia. In 2000 he suffered a heart attack caused by cocaine overdose. In 2004, he was placed in intensive care with high blood pressure, respiratory failure, and a lung infection. After Maradona retired, he suffered from obesity. At one point, he weighed 280 lbs (130 kg). In March 2005, Maradona had a Gastric bypass surgery in Cartagena, Colombia and was placed on a liquid diet for three months to try to reduce his obesity. ==Death== On 2 November 2020, Maradona was hospitalized in La Plata because of mental health reasons. A day later, he had emergency brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma. He was released on 12 November after successful surgery. On 25 November 2020, Maradona died of a heart attack at his home in Tigre, Buenos Aires, Argentina at the age of 60. == Club career statistics == Club Season League Cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Argentinos Juniors 1976 Primera División 11 2 – – – 11 2 1977 49 19 – – – 49 19 1978 35 26 – – – 35 26 1979 26 26 – – – 26 26 1980 45 43 – – – 45 43 Total 166 116 – – – 166 116 Boca Juniors 1981 Primera División 40 28 – – – 40 28 Barcelona 1982–83 La Liga 20 11 5Appearances in the 1982–83 Copa del Rey 3 4Appearances in the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup 5 6Appearances in the 1983 Copa de la Liga 4 35 23 1983–84 16 11 4Appearances in the 1983–84 Copa del Rey 1 3Appearances in the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup 3 – 23 15 Total 36 22 9 4 7 8 6 4 58 38 Napoli 1984–85 Serie A 30 14 6Appearances in the 1984–85 Coppa Italia 3 – – 36 17 1985–86 29 11 2Appearances in the 1985–86 Coppa Italia 2 – – 31 13 1986–87 29 10 10Appearances in the 1986–87 Coppa Italia 7 2Appearances in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup 0 – 41 17 1987–88 28 15 9Appearances in the 1987–88 Coppa Italia 6 2Appearances in the 1987–88 European Cup 0 – 39 21 1988–89 26 9 12Appearances in the 1988–89 Coppa Italia 7 12Appearances in the 1988–89 UEFA Cup 3 – 50 19 1989–90 28 16 3Appearances in the 1989–90 Coppa Italia 2 5Appearances in the 1989–90 UEFA Cup 0 – 36 18 1990–91 18 6 3Appearances in the 1990–91 Coppa Italia 2 4Appearances in the 1990–91 European Cup 2 1Appearance in the 1990 Supercoppa Italiana 0 26 10 Total 188 81 45 29 25 5 1 0 259 115 Sevilla 1992–93 La Liga 26 5 3Appearances in the 1992–93 Copa del Rey 3 – – 29 8 Newell's Old Boys 1993–94 Primera División 5 0 – – – 5 0 Boca Juniors 1995–96 24 5 – – – 24 5 1996–97 1 0 – – 1Appearance in the 1997 Supercopa Libertadores 0 2 0 1997–98 5 2 – – – 5 2 Total 70 35 – – 1 0 71 35 Career total 491 259 57 36 32 13 8 4 588 312 Notes == International career statistics == |- |1977||3||0 |- |1978||1||0 |- |1979||8||3 |- |1980||10||7 |- |1981||2||1 |- |1982||10||2 |- |1983||0||0 |- |1984||0||0 |- |1985||10||6 |- |1986||10||7 |- |1987||6||4 |- |1988||3||1 |- |1989||7||0 |- |1990||10||1 |- |1991||0||0 |- |1992||0||0 |- |1993||4||0 |- |1994||7||2 |- !Total||91||34 |} == References == == Other websites == * Category:1960 births Category:2020 deaths Category:1982 FIFA World Cup players Category:1986 FIFA World Cup players Category:1990 FIFA World Cup players Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentine football managers Category:People from Buenos Aires Province Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:FC Barcelona players",
