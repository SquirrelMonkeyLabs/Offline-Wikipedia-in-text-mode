 "text": "The Brandon Wheat Kings are a Canadian junior ice hockey team based in Brandon, Manitoba. They compete in the Western Hockey League, and joined the league in the 1967–68 season. Prior to that they played in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League and were known as the Brandon Elks for a short time in the 1940s. They won 8 Turnbull Cup Championships as Manitoba Junior Champions, 1939, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1960, 1962, 1963, & 1964 and appeared in the Memorial Cup five times: in 1949 (as an MJHL team), 1979, 1995, 1996 and 2010, losing each time. The team plays its home games in Westman Communications Group Place (Keystone Centre). They also played at Wheat City Arena until 1969, and the Manex Arena from 1969 to 1972. Starting in 1973, the Wheat Kings owned and operated a farm team in the MJHL, called the Travellers. An earlier incarnation of the Wheat Kings played for the Stanley Cup in 1904, but lost to the Ottawa Senators. The 1949 Brandon Wheat Kings won the Abbott Cup defeating the Calgary Buffaloes. They went on to lose the Memorial Cup to the Montreal Royals. The 1949 Brandon Wheat Kings were inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in the team category. The Wheat Kings hold the CHL record for most points (125) in a single season, setting the mark in 1978–79. The Western Hockey League announced on October 16, 2008, that the Wheat Kings were chosen to host the 2010 Memorial Cup championship at the Keystone Centre. They reached the final game, losing to the Windsor Spitfires. == Season-by-season record == Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against Season GP W L T OTL GF GA Points Finish Playoffs 1936-37 15 10 3 2 - 74 32 22 4th MJHL 1937-38 16 13 3 0 - 116 52 26 1st MJHL 1938-39 18 14 4 0 - 102 60 28 1st MJHL Won League 1939-40 24 10 10 4 - 99 95 24 4th MJHL 1940-45 Leave due to World War II 1945-46 10 7 2 1 - 102 35 15 2nd MJHL 1946-47 16 13 2 1 - 122 50 27 1st MJHL Won League 1947-48 24 15 9 0 - 115 99 30 2nd MJHL 1948-49 30 27 3 0 - 172 72 54 1st MJHL Won League, Won AbC 1949-50 36 27 9 0 - 181 113 54 1st MJHL Won League 1950-51 36 26 8 2 - 231 123 54 1st MJHL 1951-52 36 21 14 1 - 160 144 43 2nd MJHL 1952-53 36 24 11 1 - 164 123 49 1st MJHL 1953-54 36 13 22 1 - 132 151 27 2nd MJHL 1954-58 Granted Leave 1958-59 30 15 14 1 - 152 122 31 3rd MJHL 1959-60 32 23 6 3 - 185 79 49 1st MJHL Won League 1960-61 32 24 8 0 - 219 136 48 1st MJHL 1961-62 40 26 12 2 - 238 137 54 1st MJHL Won League 1962-63 39 32 7 0 - 206 124 64 1st MJHL Won League 1963-64 30 27 1 2 - 209 67 56 1st MJHL Won League 1964-65 56 30 21 5 - 230 216 65 3rd SJHL 1965-66 60 32 21 7 - 283 262 71 3rd SJHL 1966-67 57 47 9 1 - 416 178 95 2nd MJHL Lost Final 1967–68 60 21 33 6 - 238 279 48 8th Overall Lost quarter-final 1968–69 60 18 40 2 - 224 350 38 4th East Lost quarter-final 1969–70 60 23 34 3 - 234 272 49 4th East Lost quarter-final 1970–71 66 20 46 0 - 247 387 40 5th East Out of playoffs 1971–72 68 35 33 0 - 338 331 70 3rd East Lost semi-final 1972–73 68 29 30 9 - 307 304 67 4th East Lost quarter-final 1973–74 68 27 37 4 - 305 348 58 5th East Out of playoffs 1974–75 70 24 35 11 - 276 320 59 4th East Lost quarter- final 1975–76 72 34 30 8 - 341 303 76 2nd East Lost quarter-final 1976–77 72 54 10 8 - 447 242 116 1st East Lost final 1977–78 72 46 12 14 - 424 299 106 1st East Eliminated in divisional semi-final 1978–79 72 58 5 9 - 491 230 125 1st East Won championship 1979–80 72 33 37 2 - 319 343 68 5th East Eliminated in East Division semi-final 1980–81 72 29 40 3 - 342 352 61 6th East Lost East Division quarter-final 1981–82 72 34 38 0 - 372 413 68 5th East Lost East Division quarter-final 1982–83 72 21 51 0 - 327 460 42 7th East Out of playoffs 1983–84 72 44 26 2 - 463 246 90 3rd East Lost East Division semi- final 1984–85 72 17 54 1 - 264 481 35 8th East Out of playoffs 1985–86 72 24 46 2 - 324 438 50 7th East Out of playoffs 1986–87 72 19 49 4 - 282 443 42 8th East Out of playoffs 1987–88 72 26 43 3 - 348 371 55 6th East Lost East Division quarter-final 1988–89 72 25 43 4 - 286 331 54 7th East Out of playoffs 1989–90 72 28 38 6 - 276 325 62 7th East Out of playoffs 1990–91 72 19 51 2 - 265 380 40 8th East Out of playoffs 1991–92 72 11 55 6 - 246 356 28 8th East Out of playoffs 1992–93 72 43 25 4 - 347 258 90 2nd East Lost East Division quarter-final 1993–94 72 42 25 5 - 291 251 89 2nd East Lost East Division final 1994–95 72 45 22 5 - 315 235 95 1st East Lost final 1995–96 72 52 19 1 - 369 231 105 1st East Won championship 1996–97 72 47 24 1 - 339 208 95 1st East Lost Eastern Conference quarter-final 1997–98 72 45 21 6 - 322 235 96 3rd East Lost final 1998–99 72 39 29 4 - 293 267 82 2nd East Lost Eastern Conference quarter-final 1999–2000 72 25 38 4 5 212 260 59 6th East Out of playoffs 2000–01 72 32 32 5 3 244 242 72 4th East Lost Eastern Conference quarter-final 2001–02 72 43 23 4 2 261 210 92 1st East Lost Eastern Conference final 2002–03 72 43 17 9 3 258 187 98 1st East Lost Eastern Conference final 2003–04 72 28 32 9 3 230 224 68 3rd East Lost Eastern Conference semi-final 2004–05 72 45 21 5 1 255 199 96 1st East Lost final 2005–06 72 30 32 6 4 218 259 70 4th East Lost Eastern Conference quarter-final 2006–07 72 41 20 3 8 258 214 94 1st East Lost Eastern Conference semi-final 2007–08 72 42 24 3 3 253 209 90 2nd East Lost Eastern Conference quarter-final 2008–09 72 48 19 3 2 295 220 101 2nd East Lost Eastern Conference final 2009–10 72 50 18 1 3 321 204 104 1st East Lost Eastern Conference final;
