 "text": "Gregory Rabassa (March 9, 1922 – June 13, 2016) was an American literary translator from Spanish and Portuguese to English. He taught for many years at Columbia University and Queens College. He worked primarily out of Spanish and Portuguese. He made English-language versions of the works of several major Latin American novelists, including Julio Cortázar, Jorge Amado and Gabriel García Márquez. On the advice of Cortázar, García Márquez waited three years for Rabassa to schedule translating One Hundred Years of Solitude. He later declared Rabassa's translation to be better to the Spanish original. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Educators from New York City Category:Writers from New York City",
