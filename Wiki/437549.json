It covers the outer north- western suburbs of Brisbane, including Albany Creek, Arana Hills, Bray Park, Brendale, Cashmere, Dayboro, Eatons Hill, Everton Hills, Ferny Hills, Joyner, Kallangur, Lawnton, Mount Glorious, Mount Nebo, Petrie, Samford Valley, Strathpine, and Warner. ==1993 Election== There was an unusual circumstance at the 1993 election. One of the candidates, an independent, died very shortly before the election. Because of this another election had to be called for the division a month later than the general election. The Labor Party won the election, and Prime Minister Paul Keating selected his new ministers on 27 March. He did not include an Attorney-General, keeping the position open for Michael Lavarch. Lavarch won the division, and was appointed to the ministry on 27 April. ==Members== Member Party Term Michael Lavarch Labor 1993–1996 Tony Smith Liberal 1996–1998 Independent 1998–1998 Cheryl Kernot Labor 1998–2001 Peter Dutton Liberal 2001–2010 Liberal National 2010–2025 Ali France Labor 2025-present Michael Lavarch had previously had been member for the Division of Fisher.
