 "text": "John Anthony Frusciante is an American musician. He was born on March 5, 1970 in Queens, New York. He was the guitarist of the funk rock band, Red Hot Chili Peppers. He has also made a number of solo records. Some of these albums have been made with other artists, for example Josh Klinghoffer. In December 2009 Frusciante claimed on his website that he had left the band over a year ago. He was number 18 on Rolling Stones list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2003. In 2011, he was at number 72. == Early RHCP era (1988-92) == John Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 after the previous guitarist, Hillel Slovak, died of a drug overdose. The band went on to record and release their fourth album, Mother's Milk in 1989. Following an international tour, Frusciante co-recorded the band's fifth album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. In 1992, he left the band because he was overwhelmed by the international success of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Frusciante abruptly announced his departure from the band just a few moments before a performance in Tokyo. He ended up playing the show and left quickly for a plane back to the USA. == 1992 to 1997 == From 1992 to 1997, he recorded a couple of solo albums, which received various criticism due to Frusciante's use of lo-fi and strange synthesizer effects. Frusciante released Niandra LaDes & Usually Just A T-Shirt in 1994 as a cure for there being \"no good music around any more\". From the time of being out of the band, Frusciante had started to experiment with drugs such as cocaine and heroin. In 1997, he released Smile From The Streets You Hold because he needed money for drugs at the time. He later took the album off the shelves as he did not feel comfortable with it being sold. == Return and success == Bandmate and long-time friend Flea asked John if he would like to rejoin the band in 1998. Frusciante was so overjoyed by the question that the band regrouped and started the recording process. In 1999, the band released Californication. During the Californication tour, Frusciante recorded some more songs in what would eventually become To Record Only Water For Ten Days, which was released in 2001. Frusciante returned to the recording studio in early 2002 in which they would later release the band's eighth album, By the Way. Four Years later the Peppers released their ninth studio album, Stadium Arcadium. In December 2009 he announced that he would leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers and focus more on his solo albums. == Solo records and side projects == After yet another world tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante decided to release some more of his own material between 2004 and 2005. During this time, John released six of his own solo records, some of which were co-written by Josh Klinghoffer. == Music == === As a solo artist === * Niandra LaDes & Usually Just A T-shirt (1994) * Estrus EP (1997) * Smile From The Streets You Hold (1997) * Going Inside EP (2001) * To Record Only Water For Ten Days (2001) * From The Sounds Inside (2001) * Shadows Collide With People (2004) * The Will To Death (2004) * DC EP (2004) * Inside Of Emptiness (2004) * A Sphere In The Heart Of Silence (2004) * Curtains (2005) * The Empyrean (2009) * Letur- Lefr EP (2012) * PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone (2012) * Outsides (2013) === Red Hot Chili Peppers === * Mother's Milk (1989) * Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) * Californication (1999) * By the Way (2002) * Stadium Arcadium (2006) * Unlimited Love (2022) === Ataxia === * Automatic Writing (2004) * AW II (2007) ==References== == Other websites == * John Frusciante's official website * Red Hot Chili Peppers official website Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers members Category:1970 births Category:20th- century American composers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American singers Category:21st-century American composers Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters Category:American electronic musicians Category:American record producers Category:American rock guitarists Category:American rock singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American tenors Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:Living people Category:Punk musicians Category:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Category:Singers from New York City Category:Warner Bros.
