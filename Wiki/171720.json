The law states: \"As a discussion on the Internet grows longer, the likelihood of a person/s being compared to Hitler or another Nazi, increases.\" That means that as more people talk on the Internet for a longer time, it becomes more and more likely that someone will talk about Hitler or the Nazis. ==Related pages== * Association fallacy * Troll (Internet) == References == Category:Internet Category:Nazism",
