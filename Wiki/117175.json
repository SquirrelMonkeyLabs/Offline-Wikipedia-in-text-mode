 "text": "The Atlantic Hockey Association (AHA), also known for short as Atlantic Hockey, was a group of American colleges and universities that played NCAA Division I men's ice hockey against one another every season. The conference began play in 1997 as the hockey league of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and split from that league in 2003. It played through the 2023â€“24 season, after which it merged with the women-only College Hockey America (CHA) to form Atlantic Hockey America. Before the merger, the Association and CHA were closely linked. Although the conferences had separate bylaws and governing boards, they had a single commissioner and a combined office staff from 2010 to the merger. Also, three of the Association's final members housed their women's teams in CHA. All members of both conferences became members of the merged AHA. == Final members == *United States Air Force Academy (\"Air Force\") *American International College *United States Military Academy (\"Army\") *Bentley University *Canisius University *College of the Holy Cross *Mercyhurst University *Niagara University *Robert Morris University *Rochester Institute of Technology (often \"RIT\") *Sacred Heart University ==References== *",
