Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe. Knopf, 2007 * * The sudden invasion caused such chaos that the NKVD was ordered to kill or evacuate 140,000 prisoners from Soviet-occupied eastern Poland, which ended up in two-thirds of the said prisoners being killed. ==Massacre== On June 24, 15 Lithuanians who had received death sentences before the evacuation were executed (among them was , Lithuanian Minister of the Interior in 1929–1934). On June 25, about 2,000 prisoners were marched on foot by troops from the 42nd NKVD brigade to Chervyen. 500 prisoners were executed along the way for not walking fast enough. On June 27, while the remaining prisoners were put in Chervyen prison, the Belarusian NKVD received a telegram from Mikhail Ivanovich Nikolsky, head of the NKVD prison department in Moscow, ordering him to leave 400 prisoners in Chervyen and execute the rest. Hundreds more prisoners were shot during further evacuation. 200 prisoners escaped, while 40 Lithuanian prisoners survived. ==Related pages== * Naliboki massacre * Genocides by the Soviet Union * Guerrilla war in the Baltic states ==References== Category:Racism Category:War crimes Category:Communism Category:Soviet crimes against humanity",
