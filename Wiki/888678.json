== Sardar Azmoun was born into a Sunni Turkmen family. He speaks several languages fluently, including Persian, Turkmen, Turkish, English, and Russian. Azmoun enjoys horseback riding and communicated with his Turkmenistani coach, Kurban Berdyev, in Turkmen during his time at FC Rubin Kazan and FC Rostov. He chose jersey number 69 at Kazan as a tribute to the vehicle registration code of his hometown. Azmoun supports Real Madrid and has said playing for Fenerbahçe has been his childhood dream. His father, Khalil Azmoun, is a former Iranian national volleyball player and coach, having managed teams like Golgohar Sirjan and Javaheri Gonbad VC. === Retirement and Return to Football === After Iran's exit from the 2018 World Cup, Azmoun retired from international football at the age of 23. He faced heavy criticism from fans, which he said worsened his mother’s illness. To support his family, he stepped away from the national team but later returned after taking a break. === Humanitarian Efforts === Azmoun is a member of the Humanitarian Association of World Turkmens. === Other Interests === Outside of football, Azmoun is passionate about horses and runs the Serik Horse Complex in his hometown, Gonbad-e Kavus. He owns 52 horses and is involved in thoroughbred racing and breeding. In 2020, he purchased a horse named Serlik for $500,000, and in 2021, he bought another horse for $70,000. Both horses are trained by Australian jockey Michelle Payne. Azmoun also owns the Serik Gonbad Kavus Women’s Volleyball Club, which competes in the Iran Women’s Volleyball Premier League as of the 2022–23 season. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Serdar Azmoun * * Interview with RubinTV Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian footballers Category:Iranian expatriate footballers Category:Iran international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:2018 FIFA World Cup players Category:2019 AFC Asian Cup players Category:2022 FIFA World Cup players",
