 "text": "Badminton is a sport for two or four( \"singles\" or \"doubles\") people. The game is either one player against one player or a team of two players against another team of two players. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net but if it goes too far it will be an out. It is often enjoyed in various settings, from casual backyard matches to to intense professional tournaments. The aim of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net in a way that the other player or pair cannot hit it back properly before it hits the floor. Every time this is done, the player or pair gets one point. They also get to serve. The first player or pair to reach 21 points wins a set. The winner of the match is the first to win 2 sets. == History == Badminton traces its history to a game called George Cajoles, which was played in Pune, India in the 19th century by the British military officers stationed there. This game was taken by retired officers back to England where it developed and quickly grew in popularity. In 1877, the first set of written rules were arranged by the newly formed Bath Badminton Club. The All England Open Badminton Championships, the first badminton competition in the world, was held in 1899. Badminton has been an Olympic sport since 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Although badminton originated in England, it is mainly played in countries of Asia such as China, Nepal, Indonesia, India, and the Republic of Korea that now dominates this sport. The first Indian to win the All England Badminton Championship was Prakash Padukone in the year 1980. ==Equipment== *Rackets *Shuttlecocks *Net/ court *Line Courtyard *Badminton shoes ==References== == Other websites == * International Badminton Federation * Badminton Central * Badminton World Federation * https://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/",
