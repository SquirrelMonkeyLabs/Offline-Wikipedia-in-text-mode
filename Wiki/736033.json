It is about a human detective named Elijah Baley who goes to another planet called Solaria and has to try and solve a murder with the help of a robot named Daneel Olivaw. The people on Solaria hate having to be in the same room as other humans are in and have robots to do everything for them. The robots can't do anything to hurt anyone because of the Three Laws of Robotics. The only person who was ever in the same room as the victim was his wife but Baley doesn't believe she did it. Baley has to try and prove that robots were tricked into killing her without realising that that is what they were doing by a scientist who hated and was afraid of people and to figure out why he did it.
