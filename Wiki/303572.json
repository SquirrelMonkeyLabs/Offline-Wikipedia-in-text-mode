 "text": "In computer networking, mainly Internet Relay Chat (IRC), netsplit is the event when two servers disconnect. Because how IRC networks are built, a disconnection between two servers splits the entire network into two parts. This makes it look like people on the other half of the network have quit from IRC. ==Appearance of netsplits== Below is an example of typical netsplit. When two servers split, a user sees this as large number of users quitting. After the servers are reconnected, a user sees the other users rejoining. ;On GUI IRC clients * usera has quit (a.irc.net b.irc.net) * userb has quit (a.irc.net b.irc.net) * userc has quit (a.irc.net b.irc.net) * usera has joined #channel * userb has joined #channel * userc has joined #channel ;On command-line client irssi 00:00 -!- Netsplit a.irc.net <-> b.irc.net quits: usera, userb, userc 00:00 -!- Netsplit over, joins: usera, userb, userc ;To a user on a private network * usera has quit (*.net *.split) * userb has quit (*.net *.split) * userc has quit (*.net *.split) * usera has joined #channel * userb has joined #channel * userc has joined #channel ==References== * == Other websites == * Netsplit Manual (retrieved 2009-12-2) Category:Internet Relay Chat Category:Computer networking",
