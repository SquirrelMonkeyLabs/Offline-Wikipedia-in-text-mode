 "text": "The burning of the Jaffna Public Library () was an attack at the central library in the city of Jaffna, Sri Lanka. It was one of the events that led up to the Sri Lankan Civil War. The first attack on the library building was on 1 June 1981. A group of Sinhalese rioters burned the library that was one of the important libraries in Sri Lanka and one of the biggest in Asia. This was one of the most violent examples of ethnic-based book burnings of the 20th century. At the time of its destruction, the library was one of the biggest in Asia, containing over 97,000 books and manuscripts.Wilson, A.J. Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism: Its Origins and Development in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, p.125 In 1984 the library was repaired. However, the civil war had begun the previous year. The building was burned several times during the years of fighting, until 1998 when the president tried to make peace between the Sinhalese and Tamil sides. In 2003 the rebuilt library reopened again. ==References== == Other websites == *About Jaffna Library in Tamil *Official website of the Jaffna library *Jaffna library vandalized 2010 *Documentary on the burning of the library by Someetharan *History of the Jaffna public library *Burning Books - Reported by Kevin Sites Category:1981 crimes Category:1981 in Asia Category:1980s fires Category:1980s riots Category:Arson Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Asia Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in the 1980s Category:Building and structure fires in Asia Category:Jaffna District Category:1981 events Category:Libraries in Asia Category:Mass murder in Asia Category:Mass murder in the 1980s Category:Sri Lankan Civil War Category:June events",
