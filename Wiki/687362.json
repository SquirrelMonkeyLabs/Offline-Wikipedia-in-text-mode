In 1988, Miglin-Beitler Developments revealed plans to build a 1,999 foot 125-floor skyscraper in Chicago to be called the Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle. This would have been the tallest building in the world at the time of its planned completion. However, the building was never built. Miglin- Beitler had held hopes of creating the project, but these plans would never happen following Miglin's murder. Miglin was murdered at his garage in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood on May 4, 1997 by serial killer Andrew Cunanan. He was 72 years old. He had been tortured with a saw and a screwdriver, his ribs had been broken, he had been beaten and stabbed, and his throat had been slashed with a gardener's bow saw.
