The high dome of the monument is crowned by red sandstone and marble pinnacle, none of which are visible now, possibly because of the damage by atmospheric weathering. ==History== The monument is believed to be around 600 years old, and was possibly built in the Lodi Era considering its symbolic architecture. According to archaelogists, the tomb was built in rememberance of Bijri Khan who was probably a nobleman in the Lodi court. No other significant information about the tomb or Bijri Khan is available. The grave present inside the tomb doesn't have a clear inscription of who exactly was buried inside the sepulchre. ==Recent developments== In March 2021, the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the archaelogy department of Delhi government to promote the monument as venue for cultural and literary events under the 'adopt a heritage scheme'. The MoU also states that the venue once ready, will be available for events and activities such as Sufi musical recital, theaterical plays, book readings, and for product launches. The site will also be availabe for coporate and private events. ==Related pages== *Sikandar Lodi ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in New Delhi",
