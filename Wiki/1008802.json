 "text": "The Thao whipping frog, brown-folded tree frog, Fea's treefrog, Fea's gliding tree frog or Fea's large tree frog (Zhangixalus feae) is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India and China. This frog lives in trees. People have seen it in evergreen forests near water. People have seen this frog between 600 and 1400 meters above sea level. The female frog makes a nest out of foam over the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. It lives in protected parks: Hoang Lien National Park, Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, and Phou Dendin National Biodiversity Conservation Area. But it is in some danger because people cut down forests to build roads and towns and other things that people need. Visitors to the island may also hurt this frog. Sometimes people catch this frog to eat or to sell as a pet. People keep these frogs as pets or in zoos because of its bright colors. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
