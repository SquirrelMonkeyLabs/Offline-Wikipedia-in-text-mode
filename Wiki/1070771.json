 "text": "The Everett's flying frog (Philautus everetti) is a frog. It lives in Borneo and the Phillippines. People have seen it on Palawan Island. People usually see it between 750 and 1800 meters above sea level. Sometimes people see it as low as 300 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 30-32 mm from nose to rear end and the adult female frog 45-49 mm. This frog can be green or brown in color. There is a mark between the eyes. There are fewer of this frog than there were. Scientists say this is because humans change the places where the frog lives. For example, humans cut down forests where the frog lives to get wood to build with. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
