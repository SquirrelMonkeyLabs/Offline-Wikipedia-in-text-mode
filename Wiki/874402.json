 "text": "Phrynomedusa is a genus of tree frogs from Brazil. They live in the Southeast and South parts of Brazil. Scientists used to think these frogs were part of the genus Phyllomedusa, and thy called them the \"Phyllomedusa fimbriata group.\" They are called colored leaf frogs and monkey frogs in English. ==Ecology and conservation== Phrynomedusa frogs live in mountain streams and nearby ponds in the Atlantic Forest. The female frogs lay their egg clutches in cracks in the rocks above the water; the tadpoles grow in the water. Phrynomedusa are rare and humans do not know much about them. Except for P. appendiculata and P. marginata, scientists have only seen a few individual frogs from each species. Conservationists are sure that two species live in protected areas, but they do not know about the other frogs. ==Description== Phrynomedusa are small tree frogs: adult males are from nose to rear end, and females . The iris has two colors: a horizontal dark stripe in middle of the eye with dark yellow in the upper and lower surfaces. The back of this frog is smooth. There is only a little webbing on its front and back feet. They do not have flash colors on their sides, thighs, or othe rbody parts, like other phyllomedusid frogs do. Males frogs have vocal sacs and vocal slits. ==Species== There are six species, and one of them is probably extinct: Binomial name and author Common name Phrynomedusa appendiculata Santa Catarina leaf frog Phrynomedusa bokermanni Bokermann's leaf frog Phrynomedusa dryade â€ Phrynomedusa fimbriata Spiny-knee leaf frog Phrynomedusa marginata Bicolored leaf frog Phrynomedusa vanzolinii Vanzolini's leaf frog ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
