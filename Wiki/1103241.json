 "text": "Peter's foam-nest tree frog, central foam-nest tree frog, or Peter's foam-nest frog (Chiromantis petersii) is a frog. It lives in Kenya and Tanzania. Scientists think it might live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia too. This is a small frog. It has only a small amount of webbed skin on its feet. Some frogs have long lines on their backs. People see this frog in grassy land with some trees, farms, and places where people live, not far from cities. They see this frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. The female frog finds a small body of water that dries up for part of the year. She lays her eggs there. She lays them in a nest made out of foam. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and it can live in many kinds of places. Sometimes people let cows eat too much grass where the frog lives. Sometimes people catch this frog to sell as a pet. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
