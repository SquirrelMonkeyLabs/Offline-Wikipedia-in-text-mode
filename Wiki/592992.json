 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of John Delaney, the U.S. Representative representing Maryland's 6th congressional district, was announced on July 28, 2017. He became the first major Democrat to announce their campaign for President. His campaign launched with the publication of an editorial on the Washington Post's website. On the same day, he launched a campaign Twitter account and YouTube account, on which he posted a five-minute video telling voters of his plans. He ended his campaign in January 2020. ==Background== Rumors of Delaney's campaign broke the day before the publication of his editorial. Harry J. Enten wrote in FiveThirtyEight the day after the campaign's announcement that it was highly unusual for a serious presidential candidate to announce so early. Before Delaney, Pierre S. du Pont IV had held the record of the earliest announcement before the presidential primary season when he announced his campaign for the 1988 election in 1986, 615 days before the start of the Iowa caucuses. Delaney ended his campaign on January 31, 2020 after falling in poll numbers and failing to qualify for the debates. ==Endorsements== * David Trone, businessman ==References== ==Other websites== * Campaign Website Category:2020 United States presidential campaigns",
