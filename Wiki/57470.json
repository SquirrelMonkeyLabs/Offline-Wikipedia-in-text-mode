 "text": "Scottie Maurice Pippen (born September 25, 1965nba.com) is a retired American basketball player. He played for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for most of his career and won six championships with the Bulls, although he also played with Charles Barkley in 1999 for the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers near the end of his career. In addition to his chemistry with Michael Jordan, Pippen was known for his defense. His unusually long wingspan allowed him to clog passing lanes and make chase-down blocks. Pippen went by Scott Pippen early in his NBA career. Later on he earned the nicknames Pip, Robin (to Michael Jordan's Batman) and later Batman (Jordan was then called Superman). Off the court, Pippen developed a reputation for not leaving tips at restaurants, and got the nickname No Tippin' Pippen. Pippen's nephew Kavion Pippen currently plays basketball for the Southern Illinois Salukis. == References == ==Other websites== *NBA legends profile Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:African- American basketball players Category:American basketball players Category:Chicago Bulls players Category:Freemasons Category:Houston Rockets players Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters Category:National Basketball Association players with retired numbers Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States Category:Portland Trail Blazers players Category:Small forwards Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Sportspeople from Arkansas",
