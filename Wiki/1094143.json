 "text": "The Kon Tum frilled tree frog (Kurixalus motokawai) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam in the Annamite Mountains. People have seen it between 1050 and 1400 meters above sea level. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with darker brown marks. Scientists studied the frog's DNA and say it is most like Kurixalus banaensis and Kurixalus viridescens This frog lives in evergreen forests and places with smaller plants on tall hills. It sits on plants .5 to 1 meter above the ground. It can live in places that human beings have changed. Scientists think it might lay eggs in holes in trees that have water in them, like other frogs in Kurixalus. Scientists believe this frog is at some danger of dying out. Two of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve and Kon Ka Kinh National Park. Human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms. Human beings build dams to use water to make electricity. These dams can cause floods and earthquakes where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
