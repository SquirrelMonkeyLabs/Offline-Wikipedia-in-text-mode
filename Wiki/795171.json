 "text": "Alas is a landform that is a little bit lower than the surface around it. It mainly occurs in Yakutia. An alas first develops as a shallow lake. The lake eventually dries out and is replaced by grass and other plants. Alases are often used as a pasture for horses. They are common in the Central Yakutian Lowland. The largest alas in the world is Myuryu, found in Ust-Aldan District. ==References== Category:Landforms Category:Geography of Russia",
