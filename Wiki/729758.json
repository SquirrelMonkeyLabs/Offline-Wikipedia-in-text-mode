 "text": "On 3 January 2020, the United States Air Force launched an airstrike against a convoy traveling near Baghdad International Airport that was carrying several passengers, including Iranian Major General and IRGC Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces commander Abu Mahdi al- Muhandis. Several missiles reportedly struck the convoy. Five Iranians and five Iraqis were killed. In response to the killing of Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, Iran launched attacks against the United States and Iraq kicked out American soldiers from the country. Donald Trump, the president at the time, said that Soleimani was killed because he had an arrest warrant for terrorism put out by Ayatollah Khamenei. ==References== Category:2020 in Asia Category:2020s in international relations Category:2020s in Iraq Category:Airstrikes Category:Assassinations 2020 International Airport airstrike Category:January 2020 events Category:United States Air Force",
