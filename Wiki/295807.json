 "text": "The Four Asian Tigers or Asian Dragons are the highly developed economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. These regions were the first newly industrialized countries. They are known because they had very high growth rates (they became rich very fast) and fast industrialization between the early 1960s and 1990s. Four economies are currently well rich economies (developed countries). All four Asian Tigers have a highly educated and productive work force compared to others in the region. The economic success of South Korea and Taiwan were known as the \"Miracle on the Han River\" and the \"Taiwan Miracle\" respectively. The four tigers has accomplished rapid economical growth in a short period of time. All the Asian Tigers tried to export (sell) products to rich industrialized nations. They grew rich very quickly (they had double-digit economic growth) for decades. Each nation was not a democracy, and people were not very free in the early years. All of these countries later became freer, and people now think Taiwan and Korea are liberal democracies. ==References== ==Things you can read== * Ezra F.
