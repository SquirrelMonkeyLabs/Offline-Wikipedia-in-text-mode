 "text": "The Kansas City Monarchs were an American baseball team. They were the the longest-running team in the history of the Negro leagues. The team played in Kansas City, Missouri. It was owned by J. L. Wilkinson. They were members of the Negro National League from 1920 to 1930. In 1930, the Monarchs became the first professional baseball team to use a portable lighting system. It was moved from game to game in trucks to play games at night. They used the system for five years before any major league team did. The Monarchs won ten league championships before integration. They won the first Negro League World Series in 1924. The Monarchs had only one season without a winning record. The team had more major league players than any other Negro league franchise. It was disbanded in 1965. ==Baseball Hall of Famers== Players and managers listed in bold are depicted on their Hall of Fame plaques wearing a Monarchs cap insignia.
