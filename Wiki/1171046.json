 "text": "Second Cold War, Cold War II, or the New Cold War is a term that has been used by analysts and scholars to describe the growing geopolitical tensions between the United States, its allies, and the alliance of China and Russia in the 21st century. This term draws comparisons to the original Cold War that lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. During the first Cold War, the world was divided into two opposing sides: the U.S. and its allies on one side, and the Soviet Union and its allies on the other. This Second Cold War, however looks very different due to competition for global influence, military power, and economic control. ==References== Category:2010s in China Category:2010s in Russia Category:2010s in the United States Category:China-related lists Category:Russia-related lists Category:Presidency of the United States Category:21st century",
