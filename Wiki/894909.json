 "text": "A crêpe or crepe ( or , , Quebec French: ) is a type of pancake. The dough is made of flour, eggs, and a liquid, usually milk or water. The crepe is then cooked on both sides. Originally, crêpes came from Brittany in France, where they originated in the 13th century. Today, they can be found all over the world. There are two varieties: the sweet crêpe, crêpe sucrée, and the salty one, which is usually called galettes. Crêpes are usually consumed with a filling. When preparing the gallettes, usually a different kind of flour is used (blé de Sarassin, from Buckwheat), and less sugar is used. Special places that mainly servecrêpes are called crêperie in France.
