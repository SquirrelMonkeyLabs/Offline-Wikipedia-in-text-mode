Interscope Records released it on 23 November 2004 in the United States. The album is similar to All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), the band's tenth album. This is because it has rock music on it, instead of the alternative rock and dance music the band made in the 1990s. Steve Lillywhite produced the album. Other people also helped produce the album, such as Brian Eno and Chris Thomas. U2 started recording the album in February 2003. After nine months, the band had enough music for an album. However, they did not like the music. They hired Lillywhite to produce the album in January 2004. He worked with the band for six months. They changed songs and recorded them again during this time.
