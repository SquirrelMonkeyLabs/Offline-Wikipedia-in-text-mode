 "text": "The Electronic Entertainment Expo (Exposition) or E3, first held in 1995, was one of the biggest conferences for video games. Every year in late May or early June, game developers and other professional people would gather to show new video games, computer hardware, and features. It was only open to people who had been invited and people that were visiting had to be over eighteen years old. In 2019, personal information of more than 6000 people were leaked. As a result, people were harassed. On December 12, 2023, it was announced that E3 was being retired. == References == == Other websites == * Category:1995 establishments in California Category:2023 disestablishments in the United States Category:Video game events",
