Bears quarterback Rex Grossman had his throws intercepted by the Cardinals defense 4 times. Despite this issue, the Bears were able to get away and won in the second half of the game. The game became famous after Cardinals coach Dennis Green became very angry in an interview with reporters, and is one of the best comebacks in NFL history. ==The Game== The Cardinals started off strong, as Matt Leinart threw 2 touchdown passes. Rex Grossman wasn't as good, since the defense took the ball away from him 6 times. The Bears game back in the 3rd quarter, as kicker Robbie Gould scored the Bears first points. The Bears defense scored twice, and the Bears went ahead after rookie Devin Hester scored the game-winning touchdown on an 83-yard punt return. The Cardinals tried to come back, but their kicker Neil Rackers missed the game- winning kick. ==Dennis Green== The game reached a new level in fame for the after game interview.
