The server has gained significant attention on YouTube, with numerous videos about it amassing millions of views. ==History== The Minecraft server 2b2t.org was founded in 2010 by an unknown owner, known online as Hausemaster. It was advertised on 4chan and Reddit. Members from different forums launched raids against each other and their work. YouTuber TheCampingRusher uploaded a YouTube video on June 1, 2016, where he played on 2b2t. This caused a conflict on the server known as \"The Rusher War\". A queue to enter the server was soon added due to the massive influx of new players caused by the video's popularity. Players can also pay $20 to access a separate priority queue for a month. Since its creation, the server gained attention from the news. Articles were created about 2b2t on Kotaku, Vice, IGN, Newsweek and The Independent. In the book Master Builder 3.0 Advanced, in April 2015, 2b2t was described as crazy, that it can get \"outright wild,\" and that the server is a \"nightmare wasteland.\" The book also stated that it is known as \"online royalty\" among Minecraft servers. ==Other websites== *Official Reddit page ==References== Category:Minecraft",
