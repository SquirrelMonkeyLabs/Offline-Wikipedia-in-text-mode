During the war he was the highest scoring flying ace in his P-51 Mustang squadron. Towards the end of Anderson's two combat tours in Europe in 1944 he was promoted to major at 22, a young age even for a highly effective officer in wartime. After the war Anderson became a well regarded fighter test pilot, and a fighter squadron and wing commander. He served his wing commander tour in combat in the Vietnam War. He retired as a full colonel in 1972, after which he worked in flight test management for McDonnell Douglas. A member of the National Aviation Hall of Fame, Anderson has remained a sought-after speaker at aviation and military events well into his 90s. On December 2, 2022, Anderson was promoted to the honorary rank of brigadier general by Gen. CQ Brown Jr., the Air Force chief of staff at the Aerospace Museum of Oklahoma. Anderson died in his sleep on May 17, 2024, aged 102, at his home in Auburn, California. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Military people from California Category:United States Air Force Category:People from Oakland, California Category:American aviators Category:American centenarians Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Congressional Gold Medal recipients",
