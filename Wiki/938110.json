 "text": "DHL is an American founded German international logistics company. The company is providing courier, parcel delivery and express mail services. DHL is a division of the multinational logistics company Deutsche Post. DHL delivers more than 1.6 billion packages a year. It is headquartered in Bonn, Germany. ==History== ===Background=== At the beginning of the mass adoption of containers for shipping goods in the 1960s, mail services, mostly monopolies, were inefficient. The cargo documents related with the contents of the containers often also traveled by ship, so they arrived after the cargo, causing the accumulation of containers in the ports. ===Establishment=== Between the three founders, they came up with the idea of delivering shipping papers early, by plane, from San Francisco to Honolulu. In this way, customs formalities could begin before the ship reached port. Unloading time was reduced, saving shipowners costs. To make these shipments, the company often gave away airline tickets to travelers willing to carry a suitcase of business documents. The idea was the start of a new industry. This is the international express delivery service that was initially nicknamed \"Smuggling as a service\". ===Foreign offices=== From there, it underwent a great development. In 1970, DHL entered the East Coast of the United States and expanded into the Pacific in 1971. In 1974, it made its first European office in London. Since 1977, DHL has been present in the Middle East and in 1978 it opened its first office in Germany. == References == ==Other websites== * * Major DHL Express feature on Global Aviation Resource Category:Companies of Germany Category:Logistics Category:Bonn",
