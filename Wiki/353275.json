Much Latin music is accompanied by song (singing) in Spanish. Latin music is a part of world music, which is the study of popular and traditional music in all countries.Broughton, Simon & Ellingham, Mark 2000.World music. Volume 2: Latin and North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific. London: The Rough Guide. Hanly, Francis & May, Tim 1989. Rhythms of the world. London: BBC Books. Part of the story is also the influence of Latin music in other parts of the world, especially North America.Roberts, John Storm 1979. The latin tinge: the impact of latin american music on the United States. Oxford University press. Roberts, John Storm 1999. Latin jazz: the first of the fusions, 1880s to today. New York: Schirmer. In discussing Latin music these themes are important: # Place: the country and sometimes the region of the music's origin. # The former European colonial power and its heritage # The culture of aboriginal inhabitants (the Indian tribes) # The culture of slaves brought from Africa # Musical style; for instance, church music will be different from art music, and different again from popular music. In this article we shall talk mostly about popular music. For example, differences in the music of Peru from that of Brazil are influenced or caused by such differences: # Peru had few African slaves. Its colonial power was Spain, and its Indian culture was and is quite strong. Most of the population is of mixed European and Indian descent. # Brazil had many African slaves, especially in the Bahia province, and today has many people of mixed descent. Its colonial power was Portugal, and its people speak Portuguese, not Spanish. It is also geographically a vastly different country from Peru. == The influence of Europe == The influence of Europe, and in particular Spain, to Latin music is as follows: # Musical notation. Not only does this allow music to be played by any groups who wish to, it enables composers to make money. In turn, this encourages musicians to write down the music and get it published. When music is published, it can give us a record of music which is no longer played regularly or even forgotten. # European musical instruments. In every single South American and most Caribbean islands, the Spanish guitar is the most common instrument. In addition, variations of the guitar such as the Cuban tres and the Puerto Rican quattro, are widespread. Other important instruments are the cornet (later, the trumpet), the piano, the double bass, the violin and other instruments. # Systematic teaching for composers, musicians and singers began with the first cathedral in Cuba (in Santiago de Cuba). The idea of formal instruction is used widely today to get a kind of uniformity, so that a band can replace a musician with another one who can perform to a similar standard. == The influence of Africa == The influence of Africa comes mostly from slaves who originally belonged to the Yoruba, Dahomey and Congo peoples. Its importance in a Latin country varies according to whether many slaves were brought to that country hundreds of years ago. The freeing (liberation) of slaves took place at various times from the middle to the end of the 19th century.Thomas, Hugh 1997. The slave trade: the history of the Atlantic slave trade 1440-1870. Picador, London. In Latin music its influence was: # Percussion: most types of percussion, especially drums. In Cuba there were originally about 100 different types of drum.Ortiz, Fernando 1952. Los instrumentos de la musica Afrocubana. 5 volumes, La Habana. This has been simplified to only three in common use: the conga drums, the bongos, and the timbales. The first two are of African origin. Other examples of African percussion instruments are the clavés,short hardwood sticks and the shekeres.hollow gourds with a network of beads on the outside. Percussion is very important in almost any Afro-Latin group or orchestra. It is common for a conjunto (musical group) of ten or 12 musicians to have half of them playing percussion, and for even the stringed instruments to be plucked rather than bowed. # Call and response in both music and song is common. A famous example is in the film Casablanca between the character Sam (Arthur \"Dooley\" Wilsonn) nd the band in the song Knock On Wood: CALL: Who's got trouble? RESPONSE: We've got trouble! CALL: How much trouble? RESPONSE: Too much trouble! # Just as the Spanish brought the Catholic church, so the slaves brought their African religions, which today go by various names. The word santería means the fusion of catholic saints and African spirits, so for example the African orisha (spirit) Babalú is the counterpart of the Catholic saint San Lazaro.Murphy, Joseph M. 1988. Santería: an African religion in America. Boston: Beacon Press. Canizares, Raul 1993. Walking the night: the afro-cuban world of santeria. Rochester, Vermont: Destiny. The Yoruban religion in Cuba is usually called regla de ocha, while the Brazilian version of the same religion is called conbomblé. The ancient religions were not just a set of beliefs; they were the center of life in an uncertain world. The slaves brought their beliefs, their dances, their music, their instruments and their ceremonies with them in their minds. Where their masters allowed it, they reproduced the culture they had left behind. Since then, it has heavily influenced popular music in the Afro-Latin countries.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago Review Press, Part III Afro-Cuba p159 et seq. == Influence of indigenous peoples == West of the Andes, the music is clearly influence by the indigenous Indian peoples. The panpipes and flutes of Peru are distinctive, as is their most popular rhythms. In Ecuador forms of the flute occur, but most of the music is influenced by the European waltz (as the pasillo) and by various Afro-Latin styles from the Caribbean. Chile has the cueca, introduced in 1824. It was the \"most popular air of Chile\".La Tonada Despite this, the influence of the indigenous Indian peoples on Latin music is much less noticeable than the influence of European and African music. There are dozens of folk rhythms which survive,Box, Ben (1992 [and subsequent editions]). South American Handbook. New York City: Trade & Travel. At the beginning of each chapter (except the Guianas) is a section on \"Music and Dance\" written by Nigel Gallop, an Englishman, fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, who lived and worked in almost every country of South America. but usually they have had had little or no effect outside their particular locale, whereas the influence of the Spanish and African peoples is seen almost everywhere. In Argentina, the famous tango uses a rhythmical device known as the cinquillo. This is a syncopated rhythm similar to that in the Cuban habanera.habanera: a Cuban rhythm and dance of the second half of the 19th century. Its music is, like most Cuban music, Afro-latin in style. Syncopation and polyrhythms are unmistakable signs of Africa. Argentine music has a number of folk tunes and rhythms of Indian origin, but the tango is dominant and the other rhythms are not. == Latin Music in North America == Lydia Mendoza (19162007), a singer of Mexican descent, became the first American-born Hispanic to record a song in Spanish (1928).Associated Press. \"Talented Texans to be honored,\" Houston Chronicle, February 7, 2003, page 2.\"Thanks for telling the story of Texas through the arts\" (editorial), Austin American-Statesman, February 9, 2003.\"Legislature honors 13 artists, patrons,\" San Antonio Express-News, March 26, 2003, page 2B. Hispanics recording music was rare during the early 1900s. In 1960s, Tejano music (in Southern United States, Mexico), Spanish folk (in Spain), salsa (in Puerto Rico), cumbia (in South America), and bachata (in Dominican Republic) were the most popular forms of Latin music at the time. Latin music became very popular in North America and the United States in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, especially mambo, cha-cha-cha, Boogaloo and Latin soul. The popular television program I Love Lucy (1951-57) featured the character Ricky Ricardo, who was the bandleader of a Cuban orchestra in New York. In the 1970s, bolero became a popular music genre in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe became one of its important musicians. In the United States, many Hispanics were discriminated against for speaking Spanish. Because of this, many children and young adults favored English music such as rock and roll and tried not to speak Spanish outside of their home. In the 1980s, Latin music started becoming popular again. American music magazine, Billboard added several Latin music-categories. These include Top Latin Albums, Regional Mexican Albums, Tropical Albums and the Latin Pop Albums chart. Because of this, younger generations became interested in recording Latin music. During the late 1980s, freestyle music became a popular Latin music genre. Freestyle music was rarely recorded in Spanish. In the 1990s, artists including Selena, Gloria Estefan, Luis Miguel, and Thalía became popular in this decade. They helped Latin music and recording Latin music popular for young children and adults. Selena became the most popular Latin artist of the United States in 1995, when she was murdered at 23.

At the time of her death, she was competing with Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson with her album Dreaming of You (1995) which sold 3,000,000 copies its first year.
