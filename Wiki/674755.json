 "text": "Capital Development Authority (abbreviated as CDA), is a public benefit corporation responsible for providing basic services in Islamabad Capital Territory, which may include sanitation, water, streets, the public library, schools, food inspection, fire department, police, ambulance, and other health department issues and transportation. City governments often operate or contract for additional utilities like electricity, gas and cable television. The CDA was established on 14 June 1960 by executive order entitled Pakistan Capital Regulation. As of 2016, most of CDA's municipal services and departments have been transferred to the newly created Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, although CDA is still in charge of estate management, project execution and sector developments. == Other websites == * CDA Official Website Category:1960s establishments in Pakistan Category:1960 establishments in Asia Category:Government of Pakistan Category:Islamabad",
