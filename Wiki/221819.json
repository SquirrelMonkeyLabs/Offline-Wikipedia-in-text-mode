Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown. Females and young have a green crown, a grey throat with some red markings, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers. These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long tongue. They also eat small spiders and insects caught in flight. While collecting nectar, they also help in plant pollination. This species sometimes eats tree sap. Category:Birds of North America Category:Hummingbirds",
