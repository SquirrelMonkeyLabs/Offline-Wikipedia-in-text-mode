 "text": "The University of Colorado Boulder (abbreviated \"CU\") is a public university in Boulder, Colorado. The university has about 30,196 students. It was founded in 1876. ==Sports== The athletics teams of the university are called the Buffaloes. CU, a member of NCAA Division I, has 16 varsity teamsâ€”six for men and nine for women, plus a coeducational skiing team. Of these teams, all but skiing compete in the Big 12 Conference, which CU rejoined in July 2024 after spending 13 years in the Pac-12 Conference. Because neither the Big 12 nor the Pac-12 runs a skiing league, that team is a member of the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association. == Law school == The Law School at University of Colorado, Boulder, is ranked #40 by U.S. News & World Report. This is for the 2016 rankings and is out of 196 law schools. == References == ==Other websites== *The University of Colorado Boulder *Colorado Buffaloes Category:Association of American Universities Category:Big 12 Conference Category:Colleges and universities in Colorado Category:Boulder, Colorado Category:1876 establishments in the United States Category:1870s establishments in Colorado",
