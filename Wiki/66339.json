 "text": "When dealing with money, denomination is the value of the individual currency. For example a one dollar bill, a 100 dollar bill, a penny and a quarter are all different denominations of money. A one dollar bill and a one dollar coin are the same denomination as they are the same value. ==Monetary union== When countries form a monetary union, redenomination may be required and the conversion ratio is often not a nice even number, or even less than 1. New unit = x Old unit year Monetary union Austro-Hungarian krone = 0.5 gulden/forint 1892 Latin Monetary Union euro = 0.787564 Irish pound 1999/2002 Eurozone euro = 40.3399 Luxembourgish francs 1999/2002 Eurozone This table is not exhaustive.

In the £sd system, £1 = 20s and 1s = 12d, so £1 = 240d. However in the new systems £1 = 100p or $1 = 100¢ or 100c - a decimal-based system, hence the word \"decimalised\".
