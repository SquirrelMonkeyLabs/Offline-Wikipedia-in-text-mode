 "text": "The South African Military Health Service (SAMHS) is the branch of the South African National Defence Force responsible for medical facilities and the training and deployment of all medical personnel within the military. This is unusual, because most national militaries have their medical structures integrated into their existing service branches. The SAHMS plays a large part to control HIV/AIDS in the SANDF.
