 "text": "The Saturn Sky was a 2-seat Roadster. It was made by Saturn from the years of 2006 to 2009. It was sold as a 2007 to 2010 model year. The Saturn Sky was a rebadge of the Pontiac Solstice. It came out a year later. The Saturn Sky came in two trim levels. It could come as a base model or a Red Line model. It did not recieve the same hardtop coupe variant from the factory as the Pontiac Solstice did. == Base Model == The base model Saturn Sky came with a Ecotec engine. It had a four-cylinder engine with 2.4 liters of displacement. It was called LE5, and it made 177 horsepower and 173 pound-feet of torque. It could be equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission called the GM 5L40-E. It could also be equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission called the Aisin AR-5. It came with 18-inch wheels and a convertible soft top. == Red Line Model == The Red Line model Saturn Sky came with a more powerful Ecotec engine. It had a four-cylinder engine called LNF. Even though it only had 2 liters of displacement, it was turbocharged, so more powerful than the base model's 2.4 liter engine. Its engine made 260 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. This could be upgraded from the dealership with changes to the engine's computer and sensors. This optional package could boost the engine up to 290 horsepower and 345 pound-feet of torque (or 325 pound-feet of torque on automatic transmission-equipped models.) Like the base model, it could also be equipped with either a five-speed automatic or manual transmission. The difference came in the differential, which was longer in the Red Line compared to the base model. == References == Category:Roadsters Category:Saturn automobiles Category:2000s automobiles Category:Sports cars",
