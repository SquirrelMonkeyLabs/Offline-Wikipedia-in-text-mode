 "text": "\"Taps\" is a song. It is used as the final bugle call of the day (\"lights out\") and at solemn ceremonies such as military funerals. It was written in 1862 by General Daniel Butterfield, commander of a Union brigade camped in Virginia. \"Extinguish Lights\" was the original title. The words of the song (Day is done; Gone the sun) were written at later date. When or why \"Taps\" replaced the original title is unknown. The meaning of \"Taps\" is also unknown, but may refer to the sound of a muffled drum beat. Taps was adopted as part of military funerals in 1891. Taps",
