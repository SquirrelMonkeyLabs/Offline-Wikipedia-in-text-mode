The adult frog is 30-35 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back can be green or brown in color. The belly and inner legs are yellow in color. Parts of the hind legs are blue and brown in color. This frog can change color. The same frog may look different during the day and at night. The iris of the eye is gray in color with dark brown marks and a blue circle. The male frogs sit on plants 5 m over pools of water. Then they sing for the female frogs. The scientists named this frog after their friend Ken Aplin. Dr. Aplin helped study the animals of New Guinea for many years. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
