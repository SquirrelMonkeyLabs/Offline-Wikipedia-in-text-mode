 "text": "The Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 is a work for organ by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was written about 1708. It is often identified with melodramatic silent movies and scary movies, and was made famous when Walt Disney included the music in his animated movie Fantasia. Today, though, the original manuscript is lost and the work is known through copies made by Bach's students. ==In Popular Culture== Toccata has been referenced many times throughout popular culture. It is often used to represent fright, mystery, or the macabre, possibly due being written in a minor key. ==References== * Woodstra, Chris, et al. 2005. All Music Guide to Classical Music.
