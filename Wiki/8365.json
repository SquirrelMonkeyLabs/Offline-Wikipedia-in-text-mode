 "text": "Olivine (or chrysolite) is a silicate mineral made of magnesium iron silicate with the formula . It ranges in colour from chartreuse green to pale olive. In its gem form, it is called peridot. Dunite contains (or has) over 90%+ olivine in it. Dunite and other peridotite rocks are major constituents of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400 kilometers. Dunite is rarely found on land, except where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone have been thrust onto continental crust. Olivine has also been found at several extraterrestrial locations, such as the moon and many passing space rocks - as well as the outer layers of dust orbiting young stars. Chrysolite should not be confused with chrysotile, which is a form of asbestos.
