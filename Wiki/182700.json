 "text": "Frisia is an area along the coast of the North Sea. Frisians live in this area. After Wijerd Jelckama and Pier Gerlofs Donia lost a rebellion against the Burgundians and the Saxons, Frisia lost its independence. Less than a century later, parts of Frisia were conquered by the Netherlands. Those are now known as the Dutch province of Friesland or Frysl√¢n. Languages spoken in Frisia are Frisian (Frysk, Frasch/Fresk/Freesk/Friisk, Saterland Frisian), Low German ((West Low German) East Frisian, Gronings), Dutch, German, Danish.
