 "text": "A formal organization is an organization with a set of rules of procedures. It is usually used with simple writing, with a language of rules that leave little confusion for understanding. This is because people need to understand the rules otherwise they might lose employees and possibly reduce the employee expectation. Sociologist Max Weber designed a model of formal organization known as the \"bureaucratic model\" that is generally about the rationality of activities through procedures. It is one of the most efficient models for organization. In some organizations, the rules may be strictly followed, and if someone breaks that rule, they might get warned or fired; while others are be more lenient with it. == Parts of formal organization == === Stability === An important part of a formal organization is its stability. Therefore, the formal organization grows and expands with time. === Work Division === The structure of the formal organization is based on jobs to be performed by the person, and not the other way around. Roles are hierarchical, which means there are people of higher power than a certain role or there are people of lower power than a certain role. Work is assigned to people on the basis of understanding and capability. ==References== Category:Organizations by type",
