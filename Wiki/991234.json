 "text": "Sophomore is a term used in the United States to describe a student in the second year of study (generally referring to high school or university study). The word is also sometimes used in the USA as jargon for the second album released by a musician or group, the second movie of a director, or the second season of a professional athlete. The word comes from Greek, sophisma ‘clever device’ from sophizesthai ‘to devise, become wise’, and the original English spelling was \"Sophumer\". \"Your Argument..is so sillie, as that not some exq[u]isite Sophister, but any punie Sophumer may at first sight discover the feebleness of it.\" It was not until 1726 that the spelling was established in America as \"sophomore.\" == Education == === High school === In the United States, the 10th grade is usually the second year of a student's high school period and is referred to as sophomore year. High school sophomores are expected to begin preparing for the college application process, including reducing and focusing their extracurricular activities. Most students reach the age of 16 while they are sophomores. The year is considered a watermark for independence, closely connected with getting a driver's license in most states. The PSAT, a college preparatory exam taken across the U.S., is now most commonly taken during a student's sophomore year. Students at this level are also considered to be developing greater ability for abstract thinking.Sophomore Year: Between Lark and a Hard Place === College === In the U.S., colleges generally require students to declare an academic major by the end of their sophomore year. College sophomores are advised to begin thinking about career options and to get involved in volunteering or social organizations on or near campus. == References == Category:Education in the United States",
