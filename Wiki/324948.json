 "text": "Stupid was a short-lived grouping of constructivist artists, formed in Cologne in 1919. The founding members were Willy Fick, Heinrich Hoerle and his wife Angelika Hoerle (1899–1923), Anton Räderscheidt and his wife Marta Hegemann, and Franz Wilhelm Seiwert.Dempsey, 2002, p. 295. The Stupid group aimed to address sociopolitical issues through an art of proletarian character. Seiwert and Räderscheidt were at the time active in the local Dada scene. Räderscheidt's studio was their base of operations, but by 1920 he had abandoned the constructivist style. The group exhibited together and issued a publication, \"Stupid 1\", before disbanding. ==Notes== ==References== *Dempsey, Amy (2002). Art in the Modern Era: A Guide to Schools and Movements.
