 "text": "Super Typhoon Nancy had extremely intense winds near 215 miles an hour, giving her the strongest recorded winds of any tropical cyclone. It happened September 1961. The comparable cyclones of Typhoon Tip, Typhoon Keith, Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Allen all had winds at 190 miles an hour. The Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale did not exist during 1961, although Nancy would have been classified as Category Five for five and a half days, which would be a record in the Northern Hemisphere. Nancy was also destructive: she created over $500 million (1961 USD) in damage and killed around 174 people in Japan. Nancy hit Guam before that.
