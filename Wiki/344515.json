The series of pretender emperors in Kyoto were supported by the Ashikaga shogunate, but some disputed whether they were true monarchs. During these years, a Southern Court was established in the Yoshino District of what is today Nara Prefecture. The series of emperors in Yoshino were rejected by the Ashikaga shoguns and their supporters. Forces loyal to the two rival courts fought for more than six decades. This period of rivalry is sometimes identified as the early part of the Muromachi period of the History of Japan. In 1392, the Southern court stopped fighting; and the Northern Court seemed to have won the long struggle. However, the claims of the Kyoto pretenders were undermined by scholars and historians. The so-called \"emperors\" in Kyoto did not have of the essential Imperial regalia until after 1392. The succession (senso) was not passed to them from Emperor Go-Daigo. The pretenders were not confirmed with valid ceremonies (sokui). In 1911, an Imperial decree confirmed that the only legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the Southern Court emperors. ==Northern Court pretenders== * Emperor Kōgon, 1331–1333 * Emperor Kōmyō, 1336–1348 * Emperor Sukō, 1348–1351 * Emperor Go-Kōgon, 1352–1371 * Emperor Go-En'yū, 1371–1382 * Emperor Go- Komatsu, 1382–1412 ==Southern Court emperors== * Emperor Go-Daigo, 1318–1339 * Emperor Go-Murakami, 1339–1368 * Emperor Chōkei, 1368–1383 * Emperor Go- Kameyama, 1383–1392 ==Related pages== * Northern Court * Southern Court * List of Japanese eras * Muromachi period * Sengoku period ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Periods in Japanese history Category:1330s establishments in Japan Category:1390s disestablishments in Japan Category:1392 disestablishments",
