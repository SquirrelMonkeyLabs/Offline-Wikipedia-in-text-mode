 "text": "The conservation movement, also known as nature conservation, is a political, environmental and a social movement that seeks to protect natural resources including animal and plant species as well as their habitat for the future. The early conservation movement included fisheries and wildlife management, water, soil conservation and sustainable forestry. The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement's emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of wilderness areas to include conservation biology and preservation of biodiversity. ==Other websites== * A history of conservation in New Zealand * For Future Generations, a Canadian documentary on conservation and national parks * Category:Social movements",
