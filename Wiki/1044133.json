 "text": "\"Run It Back!\" is a song by American rappers Craig Xen and XXXTentacion. The song was released on June 11, 2019. The song was released on almost the one- year anniversary of XXXTentacion's murder. Xen describes X's verses as the final parts of his \"half-blonde\" era. During that era, X's songs were more violent and hardcore. Xen said that the song was an \"important piece to the culture because a lot of the new fans either don’t know about the roots of his sound or haven’t gotten into the older works\". In the song, Xen and XXXTentacion rap about the things they have and all the money they have. They also rap about hurting and killing the people who talk bad about them or their crew. A music video for the song was released. It was directed by JMP. In the video, a man looks in the mirror and carries a gun out of his house. He enters a car filled with Xen and a crew. They all put on balaclavas and drive around the hood. They enter a auto parts shop and rob the people at gunpoint. The video goes ahead a few decades and an older Xen is telling a story to children outside of XXXTentacion's mausoleum. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2019 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
