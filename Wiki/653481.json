Jolliet and Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette, a Catholic priest and missionary, were the first non-Natives to explore and map the Mississippi River in 1673. This journey would lead them to present-day Chicago River and discovered an area near a portage which would later be known as Chicago. ==References== Category:1645 births Category:1700 deaths Category:French explorers Category:People from Quebec City",
