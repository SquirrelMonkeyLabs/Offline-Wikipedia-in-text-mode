 "text": "Pan Am Flight 103 was a Pan American World Airways passenger flight that flew from London to New York City across the Atlantic Ocean. On 21 December 1988, the aeroplane flying this route was destroyed by a bomb. The explosion caused the plane to crash onto Lockerbie, Scotland. The crash killed everybody on the plane and eleven more people on the ground. The attack is also known as the Lockerbie bombing. The aircraft was a Boeing 747–121 named “Clipper Maid of the Seas”. All 243 passengers and 16 crew members died. Eleven more people in Lockerbie died when the plane fell onto the town and crashed into houses. After many years of investigation, the attack was blamed on airline officials working for Libya's government. Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan man, was convicted of murder over the attack, and later freed as he had terminal cancer. Megrahi died almost three years later. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was said to have ordered the attack until his assassination in 2011.\"Colonel Gaddafi 'ordered Lockerbie bombing'\" at bbc.co.uk == Airplane involved == The airplane that crashed was a Boeing 747–121, registered and named Clipper Maid of the Seas and it was 18 years old. ==Flight and disaster== Flight 103 had originated at Frankfurt Airport, operated by Boeing 727.

Kennedy International Airport, and then to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. At 19:02:44 Flight 103 disappeared from air traffic control, then at 19:02:50 then plane returned as five echos instead of one. A British Airways pilot, reported that he could see a huge fire on the ground. The explosion punched a 50-cm (20-inch) hole on the left side of the fuselage. As it descended, the fuselage broke up into smaller pieces, with the section attached to the wings landing first. 200,000 lb (91,000 kg) of jet fuel it contained, ignited, the resulting fireball destroyed several houses and tore a large crater through the center of Lockerbie killing 11 people on the ground. ==Victims== All 259 passengers and crew and eleven people on the ground died in the crash. Of the 259 people on the plane 190 people were Americans, 43 were British, and many more were represented, with four or fewer passengers per country.
