 "text": "Phoenix Netts is a woman whose body was found hidden in two suitcases in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, near the England–Wales border in May 2020. ==Investigation== ===Discovery=== The investigation began after a member of the public told police about a car being driven suspiciously on the A4136 road near Coleford in the Forest of Dean. Police found the car a short while later and they spoke to two people. Two suitcases containing a human body were found. The two people were arrested and a car taken by police. The body was found on May 12, 2020, around the time 11:30pm. ===Search=== A search began of Stowfield quarry and the village of Staunton. There were a lot of police in the area. There was a police helicopter and many roads were closed. The A4136 was closed between Monmouth and Coleford. Closures were expected to remain until Friday 15 May 2020. On Friday 15 May 2020 police searched places in Wolverhampton and Birmingham. The police used DNA tests to identify the victim. ===Police statements=== Detective chief inspector John Turner, the senior investigating officer, said \"The nature of this incident is distressing and we’re working around the clock to fully understand what has happened. Someone’s life has been lost and our priority is to identify the victim and get answers for her family. Searches have taken place in the surrounding area for evidence-gathering and no remains have been found as part of these searches. Our major crime investigation team is working in collaboration with the West Midlands police homicide team to carry out further enquiries.\" On Thursday 14 May 2020 a Gloucestershire police spokesman said \"Officers have been granted a 36-hour magistrates’ extension to continue questioning two people who were arrested on suspicion of murder. Overnight a 12-hour custody extension had been granted for both the woman aged in her 20s and from Birmingham and the man aged in his 30s and from Wolverhampton. The further 36-hour extension was granted at around midday today and means they can remain in custody for further questioning. Due to the ongoing investigation, road closures and scene guards are likely to remain in place. Gloucestershire constabulary would like to thank local residents and those impacted by the cordons for their patience during this time.\" On Friday 15 May 2020, Gloucestershire police said \"A postmortem examination yesterday was found to be inconclusive and further examinations are ongoing to establish the cause of death. DNA testing is also ongoing to identify the female victim. Searches have continued today around the area of Stowfield Quarry, near Coleford, and some road closures remain in place in the surrounding area. ===Impact=== Key workers had to find ways around the closed roads. Some thought that the roadblocks were to stop people travelling from England to Wales to exercise. People are only allowed to exercise in their own area because of COVID-19. ==Charges== A 27 year old woman from Birmingham appeared before Cheltenham Magistrates' court on 19 May 2020 and was charged with killing the woman between 14 April and 12 May 2020 at her home in Birmingham. She was remanded to appear in Gloucester Crown Court on 19 May 2020. A 38 year old man from Wolverhampton was charged with assisting an offender between 25 April and 12 May 2020 and was also remanded to appear before Gloucester Crown Court on 19 May 2020. Both were refused bail appeared before magistrates in Cheltenham via video-link. ==Identification== The body was that of Phoenix Netts, a 28 year old woman from Birmingham.

He must also give police his travel documents. No application for bail was made for the woman from Birmingham. Both suspects were to next appear at Bristol Crown court on 4 August and a provisional trial date of 10 November has been set. In November 2020 all charges against the man were dropped.
