He was the son of Ramji Bhangare, a Koli who also resisted the British rule and was subsequently hanged in Cellular Jail. He was only ten years old when he took up arms against British rule in Maharashtra. Raghoji Bhangare turned to rebellion after his mother was tortured by British officials with the assistance of some Marwadis of village. The Indian social activist, thinker, anti-caste social reformer and writer from Maharashtra Jyotirao Phule may have been inspired by the revolts of Raghoji Bhangre, among others. The revolts of Raghoji Bhangare are considered as highly significant in the history of Maharashtra. Compared to the revolts made by Raghoji Bhangre, the other revolts were not very significant though they continued to take place until 1946-47. Raghoji Bhangre became known by the honorific title Bandkari for his exploits.
