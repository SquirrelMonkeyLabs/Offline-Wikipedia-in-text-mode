 "text": "The Seuna (Yadava) Civil War was a time of civil war in the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty of the Deccan region in the late 13th century. The conflict was between two brothers, Ramchandra Yadava and Ammana, who both wanted to control the kingdom. Ramchandra, with the help of his generals Hemad Pant and Tikkama Saluva, defeated Ammana's faction. Ammana was captured after his defeat. Ammana was punished in a cruel way. His eyes were destroyed, and he was later executed. His general, Narasinha, was taken as a prisoner. After this victory, Ramchandra Yadava became the ruler and brought an end to the conflict. This event was an important turning point in the history of the Yadava dynasty. ==Background== ===Mahadeva of Devagiri=== Mahadeva, ruled around 1261–1270 CE) was a king of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty in the Deccan region of India. He became king after his brother Krishna. Mahadeva defeated the Shilaharas of Kolhapur and stopped a rebellion by the Kadamba rulers who were under his control. He attacked nearby kingdoms, fought an unclear battle with the Kakatiya queen Rudrama, and lost to the Hoysala king Narasimha II. Some records from his time mention other victories, but these may have been exaggerated. ===Ascension to the Throne of Devagiri=== ====Death of Krishna of Devagiri==== Krishna's last inscription is dated to May 1261. At the time of his death, his son Ramachandra was likely either not yet born or too young to hold the title of yuvaraja (heir apparent) or ascend the throne. Consequently, Krishna was succeeded in 1261 by his brother Mahadeva, who had been designated as the heir apparent since at least 1250 and had assisted in the administration during Krishna's reign. ==Prelude== ===Ammana's Ascension to the Throne of Devagiri=== Ammana was the son of Mahadeva, a king of the Yadava dynasty. Mahadeva became king around 1261 after his older brother Krishna died. He likely took the throne because Krishna's son, Ramachandra, was too young to rule. When Mahadeva died around 1270, Ammana became king. However, Ramachandra challenged Ammana's claim to the throne. ===Ramachandra's Escape and Preparations=== Many people supported Ramachandra, including important officers and generals like Hemadri and Tikkama. These officers had been loyal to Mahadeva but switched their support to Ramachandra after Ammana became king. When Ramachandra decided to claim the throne, Ammana could not stop or capture him. Ramachandra escaped from the capital and started planning to take the throne using a clever strategy. ==The Senua Interregnum== Ammana, a young and carefree king known for his love of dancing and music, ruled over Devagiri. Ramachandra, a determined leader, planned a bold coup to take over the fort of Devagiri. Disguised as a leader of a group of traveling performers, he and his followers gained access to the fort. Once inside, they arranged a performance for Ammana. During the show, Ramachandra and his group removed their disguises, captured Ammana, and took control of his main supporters. This plan succeeded because many of Ammana’s generals, except for Narasimha, did not fully support him. A document from Ramachandra himself confirms this account, making it a reliable version of events. ===Imprisonment or Execution of Ammana=== According to the Mahanubhava writings, such as the Lila Caritra, Ramachandra took the throne by blinding his cousin Ammaṇa. This account is considered believable because it reflects the fear and reactions of people at the time. Another text, Smriti-stala, criticizes Ramachandra for this act and blames it for his later defeat by Muslim forces. However, this account seems biased and less accurate. A third Mahanubhava text, Bhanuvijaya, gives a highly exaggerated version of the event about execution of Ammana and is not seen as reliable. ==Aftermath== After taking the throne from his cousin Ammana through a coup in the capital Devagiri, he expanded the Yadava kingdom by fighting neighboring states such as the Paramaras, Vaghelas, Hoysalas, and Kakatiyas. In 1296 CE, he had to pay yearly tribute to Alauddin Khalji after a Muslim army from the Delhi Sultanate invaded. When he stopped paying the tribute in 1303-1304 CE, Alauddin sent his general Malik Kafur to attack him in 1308, making the Yadavas vassals of the Delhi Sultanate. After this, Ramachandra became a loyal supporter of Alauddin, helping him defeat the Kakatiyas and Hoysalas. == References == Category:13th-century conflicts Category:13th century in India Category:Wars involving Asia Category:Maharashtra",
