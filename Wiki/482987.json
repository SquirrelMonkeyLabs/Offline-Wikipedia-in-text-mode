 "text": "Roger Cecil (18 July 1942 - 22 February 2015) was a Welsh painter and mixed media artist. He was born in Abertillery, and studied at Newport College of Art and St Martinâ€™s School of Art. In 1964 he won the David Murray Landscape Award from the Royal Academy. He was known for both his figurative and largely abstract paintings, \"rich in imagery, poetry and colour, which are drawn from his environment, the industrial valley towns and mountains.\" In later years Cecil suffered from dementia. He was reported as missing from hospital on 21 February 2015, and was last seen in the early hours of 22 February. After a search, his body was found on 24 February in a field near Cwmbran. Gwent Police treated the death as unexplained. They referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because a member of the public had spoken to a police officer about Cecil before his body was found.
