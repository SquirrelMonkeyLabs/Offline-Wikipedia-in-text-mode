 "text": "The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack is an animated television series made for Cartoon Network. The show was made by cartoonist Thurop Van Orman, who has worked as a writer and storyboard artist on Camp Lazlo and The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy. The main characters Captain K'nuckles, Flapjack & Bubbie, are trying to find the magical island \"Candied Island.\" Flapjack is an adventurous little boy taking after and learning from Captain K'nuckles. K'nuckles plays the role of a lazy sailor who is addicted to maple syrup. Bubbie is a antropomorphic whale who is the foster mother of Flapjack and protects him from dangerous situations, while he is being accompanied by K'nuckles. == Characters == * Flapjack (voiced by Thurop Van Orman) is a cheerful yet gullible orphan who was raised by Bubbie at a young age. Flapjack's biological parents are never seen or mentioned. Flapjack is na√Øve and oblivious to danger, and he is easily caught in dangerous situations. He holds K'nuckles in extremely high regard, with his affection for the captain sometimes bordering on obsession, although he can exhibit some anger towards K'nuckles when he lies to him. During the ending of the final episode, Thurop's son Leif plays the role of Flapjack. Flapjack's original voice actor was meant to be Paul Reubens, but Reubens never showed up to any recording sessions, so Van Orman voiced Flapjack himself. * Captain K'nuckles (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray) is an old Irish sea captain. He claims to be a great adventurer, often telling Flapjack fabricated or exaggerated stories of his past experiences. K'nuckles enjoys candy and maple syrup, often valuing the acquisition of candy more than his relationships. Because of his often sociopathic behavior, K'nuckles has earned the open hostility and disrespect of nearly everybody in Stormalong. Although he often exploits Flapjack for his own needs, he is fond of him and will often attempt to get him out of trouble or make things right when a scheme of theirs goes too far. His hands, legs, and bottom are wooden prosthetics. During the ending of the final episode, Thurop Van Orman portrays live-action K'nuckles. * Bubbie (voiced by Roz Ryan) is an anthropomorphic whale. She is Flapjack's adoptive mother; she found him at sea in a bed of seaweed when he was a baby. Knuckles and Flapjack live inside her mouth, and she serves as their transportation as well as home. Bubbie disapproves of Flapjack's adventures, and she views K'nuckles as a bad influence on him. However, she often caves in, allowing Flapjack to go on adventures despite her wishes. == Episodes == === Season 1 (2008-2009) === # Several Leagues Under the Sea / Eye Sea You (June 5, 2008) # Several Leagues Above the Sea / That's a Wrap!
