 "text": "The commutative property says that the order of the numbers when adding or multiplying can be changed without changing the answer. For example, both 2+8 and 8+2 are equal to 10, and both 5*7 and 7*5 are equal to 35. This can be done with any numbers, or with more than two numbers. ==Definition== The definition of commutative property of addition is a+b=b+a. a and b are variables and can be any number. Some operations like dividing are not commutative. For instance, 6\\div3 is 2, but 3\\div6 is \\frac{1}{2}. Subtraction is not commutative either: 6-2 is 4, but 2-6 is negative 4. ==Higher mathematics== In higher mathematics like calculus, there are other commutative operations besides adding and multiplying. Commutative property must hold for each two elements of an Abelian group. Category:Algebra Category:Rules of inference",
