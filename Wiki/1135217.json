 "text": "Liquid breathing is when an organism that usually breathes air breathes a special liquid rich in oxygen. This liquid can exchange carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen, like perfluorocarbon (PFC).GAEDEKE NORMS, M., RN, MSN, CCRN, CS, et al. Liquid Ventilation: It's Not Science Fiction Anymore. AACN Clin Issues Crit Care Nurs. 1994;5(3):246-254. Cited in: Your Journals@Ovid Full Text at http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE;=reference&D;=yrovftb&NEWS;=N&AN;=00002245-199408000-00004 . It should possess some properties like dissolving of gases in it, appropriate viscosity and stability. Correct selection of PFC is highly important based on medical application, whether respiration or drug delivery or blood substitution is required. PFC liquids can carry more oxygen and more CO2 as compared to blood. Liquid breathing could save the life of a person who has sustained serious injury to their lungs or heart. Liquid breathing has also been proposed for use in deep diving It could also be used for deep-sea diving and space travel.Featured on the ABC television program That's Incredible. Cathy Lee Crosby describing diving and spaceflight applications. Voice-over with stock video. But there is no standard way to use it yet. == References == Category:Respiratory system",
