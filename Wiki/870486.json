 "text": "The red-rimmed leaf frog (Phyllomedusa boliviana) is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. People have seen it between 200 and 1800 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog on the sides of the Andes Mountains, where the ground is dry, in forests and near forests. People have also seen the frogs in places that people have changed, such as human- made ponds and places where cows drink water. The female frog finds a leaf hanging over the water. She pulls the leaf into a cone shape. She lays her eggs in the cone. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. The frog might have problems in a few places where human beings go into the forests to cut wood for fuel. Scientists think this might be more than one species of frog and think they should look at this frog more to be sure. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
