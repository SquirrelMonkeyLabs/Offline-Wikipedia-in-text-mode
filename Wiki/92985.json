 "text": "Mecklenburg-Strelitz is a former district in the southern part of Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania, Germany. The district-free city (urban district) of Neubrandenburg is nearly completely surrounded by Mecklenburg-Strelitz district. The capital of the duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the town of Strelitz. In 1712 a fire completely destroyed the town. The duke decided to build a new town on the shores of a small lake called the Zierker See. This town became Neustrelitz, or in English New Strelitz. The district was created by joining the three old districts Neubrandenburg, Neustrelitz and Strasburg in 1994. == Coat of arms == The bull head on a yellow field is the coat of arms of the dukes of Mecklenburg. The tower stands for the castle of Stargard, the longtime home of the dukes of Mecklenburg since it was built in the 13th century; it remains the northernmost mountain-top castle in present-day Germany. The Maltese cross is a reminder of the Order of St. John of Malta who owned a lot of loand in the area before 1648. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Amt-free municipalities #Neustrelitz #Feldberger Seenlandschaft Ämter Ämter Ämter *1.
