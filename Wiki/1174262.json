 "text": "The 1910 Lille international women's fencing tournament was an international women's foil fencing competition that took place in Lille, France in late June 1910. It was one of the earliest women's international fencing cometition in history. ==Background== While fencing was already practiced by women during the 19th century, fencing was in this era a male-dominated sport. This fencing competition was one of the earliest international fencing competition in the history of women's fencing, after the 1910 Englandâ€“Belgium women's fencing competition three months earlier in 1910. ==Tournament== On 25 June 1910 it was announced that the Verbrugge Fencing Hall from Antwerp, Belgium would send a delegation of fencers of the Ladies Fencing Club to participate in the tournament. These Belgian fencers were Marthe Pungs and Leni Preetorius. The competition was attended by among others the French minister of War Jean Brun and notables of the French Army. Belgian Marthe Pungs finished second ahead of Belgian Leni Preetorius who finished third. After the competition an assault of Belgian fencers Marthe Pungs and Leni Preetorius was organized. ==Responses== The event was reported positively in the Belgian media. The Belgian fencers were described as \"charming\" and \"sympathetic\". The style of the two Belgian women was praised. A part Fernand Lenoir wrote for Le Matin: ==Legacy== Others international women's fencing meetings were organized in the following years in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. These international fencing meetings contributed to the progress of women's fencing and closing the gap between women's fencing and men's fencing. As a result women's fencing was introduced in 1924 at the Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1910s in women's fencing Category:Sport in France Category:1910 in Europe Category:1910s in France",
