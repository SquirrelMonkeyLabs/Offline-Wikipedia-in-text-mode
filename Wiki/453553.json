 "text": "Jeff Plewman (March 26, 1948 - May 10, 2014), better known by his stage name Nash the Slash, was a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician. He was best known for being the founding member of the progressive rock band FM and performing with British musician Gary Numan. He was also a multi- instrumentalist who played mostly the electric violin and mandolin, as well as harmonica, keyboards, glockenspiel, and other instruments. Nash's musical trademark was his face being covered in surgical bandages. He got the name \"Nash the Slash\" by using the name of the main antagonist of the Laurel and Hardy silent movie Do Detectives Think? (1927). Nash was born in Toronto, Ontario. In 1998, he revealed that he was gay at Toronto's Pride Week. He retired in 2012. Nash died on the weekend of May 10, 2014 at his home in Toronto, aged 66. The cause of his death was a suspected heart attack. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1948 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Canadian guitarists Category:Canadian LGBT people Category:Canadian rock musicians Category:Canadian singer-songwriters Category:Gay men Category:LGBT musicians Category:Rock singers Category:Singers from Toronto",
