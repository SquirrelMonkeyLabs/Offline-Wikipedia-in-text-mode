 "text": "General elections were held in Guatemala on 25 June 2023 to elect the president and vice president, all 160 seats of the Congress, all 20 members of the Central American Parliament, and mayors and councils for all 340 municipalities in the country. Current president Alejandro Giammattei was not allowed to run for a second four-year term. Since no presidential candidate won over 50% of the vote, a second round is scheduled between the top two finishers on 20 August. Former First Lady Sandra Torres from National Unity of Hope and Congressman Bernardo Arévalo from Semilla won the first round, both advancing to the run-off. However, there was a recount since Arévalo's victory caught everyone by surprise as he was not doing well in the polls. On 13 July, the Constitutional Court, the highest court for constitutional law approved of the results, allowing the run-off to continue for 20 August 2023. Arévalo defeated Torres in the second round with nearly 61 percent of the vote in what was seen as a landslide. ==Major candidates== * Bernardo Arévalo (Semilla), Member of Congress (since 2020) and son of former President Juan José Arévalo * Armando Castillo (VIVA), Member of Congress (since 2020) * Manuel Conde Orellana (Vamos), Member of Congress (since 2016) * Edmond Mulet (Cabal), former President of the Congress (1992–1993) and 2019 presidential candidate * Carlos Pineda (PC), businessman * Zury Ríos (Valor-PU), former Member of Congress (since 1996-2012), 2015 presidential candidate and daughter of former President Efraín Ríos Montt * Sandra Torres (UNE), former First Lady (2008-2011) and 2015 and 2019 presidential candidate * Manuel Villacorta (VOS), Ambassador to Israel (1999-2000) ==References== Category:2023 elections Category:2020s in Guatemala Category:Elections in North America Category:June 2023 events Category:August 2023 events",
