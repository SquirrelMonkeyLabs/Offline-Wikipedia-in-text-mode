 "text": "Welcome to Sky Valley, also known as just Sky Valley, is the third studio album by American rock band Kyuss. It was released on 28 June 1994 on Elektra and Chameleon Records. ==Background and composition== Welcome to Sky Valley was recorded in early 1993 and was first meant to be released in January 1994. Because their last album did fairly well, they moved to the main record label Chameleon from the smaller label \"Dali\". In November 1993, Chameleon suddenly shut down. Elektra then quickly signed the banned and planned to release Welcome to Sky Valley in March 1994. The release was then slowed down even more and the album wasn't released until June 1994. The album has been called stoner rock, stoner metal, and desert rock. The album was the first Kyuss album to have bassist Scott Reeder playing on it. He replaced Nick Oliveri in 1992. It was also the last with Brant Bjork playing on it. ==Packaging== Welcome to Sky Valley is named after the place in California of the same name. The album cover shows a welcome sign in Sky Valley next to a road that says the album's name, \"Welcome to Sky Valley\". The photograph was taken at dusk and the road is dark with a purple sky behind. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits taken from the album's liner notes.
