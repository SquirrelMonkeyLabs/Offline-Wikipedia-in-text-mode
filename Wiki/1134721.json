 "text": "Hippalus (Ancient Greek: Ἵππαλος) was a Greek navigator and merchant, likely active in the 1st century BCE. He is credited with discovering a direct maritime route from the Red Sea to Tamilakam, located on the Indian subcontinent, over the Indian Ocean. This route facilitated more efficient trade between the Roman province of Aegyptus and India. == Use of Monsoon == Hippalus is associated with the discovery of the direct sea route and the use of the monsoon winds to navigate it. The 1st-century CE text, Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, attributes the route discovery to Hippalus. While Pliny the Elder attributed the discovery of the monsoon winds themselves to him, some historians suggest this may be due to confusion between names and the common knowledge of the winds in the Hellenistic era. == Significance == Hippalus's route revolutionized trade by recognizing the north–south orientation of India’s west coast and facilitating direct sea voyages across the Arabian Sea to the Malabar coast, enhancing trade between the Roman Empire and Indian kingdoms. == References == Category:Ancient Greeks",
