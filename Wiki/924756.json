 "text": "Hilda Reyes Jensen (née Reyes) was a former Brown Beret. She was a big contributor to the Chicano movement and women's rights within the movement. == Early life and Career == Jensen joined the Brown Berets when she was 14 years old. A photographer took a picture of her wearing a bandolier. The photo became the face of the Brown Beret movement. The image was put on posters, buttons, books and more things to raise funds for the Brown Berets. Because of the sexist environment of the Brown Berets, Jensen ended up leaving the it and forming a new movement with other former Brown Beret women called Las Adelitas de Aztlán. Unfortunately, violence occurred at a rally leaving many protestors dead, in the same year Las Adelitas de Aztlán fell apart. Jensen decided not to ever join an organization again because of the lives that had been lost. == References == Category:American activists",
