 "text": "Paulo Sérgio Rosa, commonly known as Viola (born 1 January 1969), is a former Brazilian footballer who played as a forward. He was given his nickname in his youth, which was a reference to the brand–name of his first pair of football boots. ==Career== Viola is famous for his strong personality on the pitch and great appearances in several teams he has played for throughout his long playing career. His first great appearance was in his second match, in the final game of 1988 Campeonato Paulista (1st Division Championship of São Paulo State) between Corinthians and Guarani, considered by the press as having a better team. Viola was called just because the main Corinthians forward, Edmar, was called by the Brazil national football team and then sold to Pescara – and because his main substitute, Marcos Roberto, was with a broken arm. Viola was not having a great offensive presentation, but could score the title goal in the extra time – by putting his leg in the way of a lopsided shot from Wilson Mano, turning it into an assist. Although Viola became a unexpected and immediate star, Viola did not have a regular basis of good presentations and passed through some loanings until 1992 – he was not part of the first Corinthians title at Brasileirão, in 1990, when he was loaned to São José. He then had a reasonable year in 1992, not being similar to the skinny boy from 1988. In 1993, Viola almost did another title goal to Corinthians in the Campeonato Paulista, celebrating it with a pig imitation – mocking the Palmeiras nickname. But in the second final match, the rivals won the tournament. However, Viola continued to celebrate his goals in joking ways, increasing his popularity. He was then first called by the Brazil team, going to 1993 Copa América and to 1994 FIFA World Cup when he came as a substitute in the extra time, bringing an dynamic performance to a tied game. Viola also ended 1994 as runner-up with Corinthians in the Brasileirão. By the beginning of 1995, Viola was sold to Valencia, but remained for a further six months in Corinthians - the winning the Campeonato Paulista and the Copa do Brasil. However, he did not fit in Spain. Although Viola had reasonable goal numbers, he chose to return to Brazil by the mid of 1996, even signing with Palmeiras. He did not have a regular frequency of good presentations, and left the club after the runner-up campaign in the 1997 Brasileirão, signing with Santos. He then earned again good performances, leading the team to the semifinals of the Campeonato Paulista and of the Brasileirão, and to the 1998 Copa Conmebol title. He also ended the Brasileirão as top scorer. His career's last good moments were in Vasco da Gama, by 1999 and 2000, as a supporting member of the runner-up squad of 2000 FIFA World Club Cup and of the 2000 Copa Mercosur and Brasileirão champions. Viola then had an unsuccessful return to Santos in 2001. In he left Brazil again to join Turkish side Gaziantepspor, where he scored 18 goals in 46 Super Lig matches during a -season spell. His last coming back trial was in Taboão da Serra, in 2015. ==Honours== ===Club=== Corinthians *São Paulo State League: 1988, 1995 *Copa do Brasil: 1995 Santos *Copa Conmebol: 1998 Vasco da Gama *Brazilian League: 2000 *Copa Mercosur: 2000 ===International=== Brazil *FIFA World Cup: 1994 ===Individual=== *São Paulo state league's top scorer: 1993 *Brazilian league's top scorer: 1998 *Copa Conmebol's top scorer: 1998 ==References== ==Other websites== * *Guardian Article * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from São Paulo Category:Association football forwards Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players",
