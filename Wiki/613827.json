 "text": "Inversion (or finding the inverse) is an idea from mathematics, which is about finding a number, function or mathematical structure which is different from the current one, but which has similar properties. The simplest case of this is negation: Given a positive number, find the negative number which has the same value, except for the sign. Inversion can refer to the following concepts: *The inverse element for addition or for multiplication. *An inverse function *Inverse (logic) *The inversion of an Invertible matrix *The Fourier inversion theorem states that sometimes, it is possible to reconstruct the original function, after a Fourier transform *In Set theory, the complement will return all elements not in the set. *Inversive geometry studies the properties of a shape that are preserved after geometrical inversion.",
