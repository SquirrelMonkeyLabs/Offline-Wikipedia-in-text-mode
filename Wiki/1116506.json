Scientists think it might also live in Bolivia. ==Body== The adult frog is about 13.04-16.16 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog has unusual colors: It has red-orange stripes down its sides and backbone. It has a big yellow stripe on each side of its body. It has a black mark in the shape of the letter U on its head. All four legs are blue with small black dots and spots. The iris of the eye is black in color. ==Home== This frog lives in rainforests that have never been cut down and rainforests that have been cut down and have had a long time to grow back and in many other places. This frog mostly lives on the ground, but it sometimes climbs up to where the tree branches come together like a roof. It lives in forests that are not too high up in the mountains. People have seen this frog between 0 and 500 meters above sea level. ==Young== The male frog finds a high plant to sit on and calls to the female frogs. His voice sounds like a buzz. The frogs lay eggs all year. She lays 2-7 eggs at a time. If there is enough food for her to catch and eat, she can lay eggs four times a month, all year. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries them on his back to different pools of water in bromeliad plants. People have seen male frogs carrying four tadpoles at a time. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not danger of dying out because it lives in a large place and there are many of them. But it is in danger in some places because people cut down trees to make farms. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
