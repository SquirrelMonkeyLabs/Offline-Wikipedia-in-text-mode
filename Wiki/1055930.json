Devitt would leave New Japan Pro-Wrestling after his loss. == Leadership under AJ Styles == After Okada's tag match, he would stare down Fale. A hooded man would then run into the ring and attack Okada. He would take the hood off and he would be revealed as AJ Styles. At Wrestling Dontaku 2014, Styles would face Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Okada's former CHAOS stable member Yujiro Takahashi would turn on and attack Okada behind the referee's back.
