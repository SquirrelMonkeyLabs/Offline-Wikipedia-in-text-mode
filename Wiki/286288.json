He participated in the movement for labour-union formation and also in drafting the law of separation of church and state. Briand was criticised for trying to make peace with Germany. However, it was Briand who played a leading role in formulating the Locarno Pact, a treaty intended to establish peace in western Europe and ease relations with Germany. == References == ==Other websites== * Nobel biography * Timeline for the 150th anniversary of Aristide Briand Category:1862 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Prime ministers of France Category:French Nobel Prize winners",
