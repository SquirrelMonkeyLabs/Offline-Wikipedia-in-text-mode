 "text": "Ruben Salazar (March 3, 1928 – August 29, 1970) was a Mexican-American civil rights activist and a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. He was the first Mexican-American journalist from mainstream media to cover the Chicano community. He was born in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. Salazar was killed, aged 42, on August 29, 1970, in Los Angeles, California after he was hit by a tear-gas projectile fired by a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy. No criminal charge was filed, but Salazar's family reached an out-of-court financial settlement with the county. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in the United States Category:Police misconduct in the United States Category:American murder victims Category:Mexican journalists Category:Mexican activists Category:American civil rights activists Category:Journalists from Los Angeles",
