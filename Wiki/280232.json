 "text": "The Scion xB was a car made by Toyota for the United States and was sold under the Scion brand. It is a box-shaped, 5-door small car and is sometimes called the box car. There are two types of Scion xB cars on the road today. The first type was made from 2004 until 2006. This type was known for its boxy shape and high fuel economy. The second type was made from 2008 until 2015. This type looks much rounder and it is more powerful than the first type of car. This type is also not as popular because it is a more generic type of car. There has been a lot of criticism about the second type of Scion xB because of this reason. Also, many original xB owners despise the xB2 even being called an xB. The xB2 has its own name in other markets. Scion used the xB name in an attempt to help sell it in America.
