 "text": "Data management is the practice of collecting and using data as effectively as possible. It is sometimes called information management or knowledge management. Data management makes information useful by organizing it and making it easy to access. It is important to manage data correctly, or it might be lost or accidentally deleted by scientists trying to use the data. Usually, data is stored in central collections (called \"warehouses\") for management. Data management applications make it possible to search for specific data in these collections. ==Related pages== * Data collection * Generative artificial intelligence ==References== Category:Knowledge Category:Computers",
