It lives in Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and parts of Victoria. This frog lives in forests. It lives in dry forests and wet forests, such as rainforests. It can also look for food on land that humans use to graze animals. The female lays eggs in pools next to streams and other places where the water does not flow quickly. The eggs stick to the undersides of rocks and to the bottom of the body of water. This frog can catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of Australia",
