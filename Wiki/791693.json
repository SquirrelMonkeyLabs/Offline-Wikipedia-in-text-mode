He was National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and counter-terrorism for the United States between 1998 and 2003. Clarke worked for the State Department during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush appointed him to chair the Counter-terrorism Security Group and to a seat on the United States National Security Council. President Bill Clinton kept Clarke and in 1998 promoted him to be the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism, the chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council. Under President George W. Bush, Clarke initially continued in the same position but no longer had Cabinet-level access. He later was appointed as the Special Advisor to the President on cybersecurity. Clarke left the Bush administration in 2003 after criticizing him over invading Iraq after the September 11 attacks. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American political writers Category:American political commentators Category:Politicians from Boston Category:Writers from Boston Category:People from Dorchester, Massachusetts",
