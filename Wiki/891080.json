 "text": "Oldwick is a place in Hunterdon County in New Jersey. It is an unincorporated area. That means it is not officially a town. ==History== The first European people to live in this place were English. In the early 1700s, they called their village Smithfield. People whose ancestors came from Germany moved there too. In the 1750s, they changed the name to \"New Germantown.\" In 1918, the United States was at war with Germany, so the people in the town changed the name again. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in New Jersey Category:Hunterdon County, New Jersey",
