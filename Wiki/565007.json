 "text": "A Chromebook is a laptop that uses the Linux-based Chrome OS as its operating system was introduced on May 11, 2011 manufactured by Acer and Samsung. It uses the Internet. Most applications and data are in the \"cloud\". A Chromebook is an example of a thin client. It is a lightweight computer which uses remote access to a server. It depends heavily on another computer (its server) to do its computation. In March 2018, Acer and Google announced the creation of the first Chromebook tablet, the Chromebook Tab 10. This device was to compete with the market for cheap Apple iPad tablets in the education market. The Tab 10 screen (9.7 inches, 2048 x 1536 resolution) was identical to that of the iPad. The device includes a stylus. Neither device included a keyboard. In March 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools used Chromebooks to do school online, and put apps onto it like Google Meet and Zoom. 30 million Chromebooks were bought by schools in 2020 alone because of it. Some schools used iPads, but since they are too expensive for other schools, they use Chromebooks instead. == References == Category:Laptops Category:Google",
