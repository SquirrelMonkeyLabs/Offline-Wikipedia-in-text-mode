 "text": "G11 is a German assault rifle. It was invented by Heckler & Koch in the years between 1968 and 1990. It is able to shoot in semi automatic, or single shot, 3 round burst, or full auto. The magazine held 45 or 50 of the 4,73mm caseless rounds. The German army (Bundeswehr) and the US Army tested the weapon but they didn't want it because it was too expensive after the Cold War. So it stayed to be a prototype and never got into mass production. == References == Category:Assault rifles Category:Bullpup rifles",
