He disliked it. He walked out while of the London premiere and withdrew his permission to use his song \"Here Comes the Sun\". It was replaced with \"Good Day Sunshine\". After part of the play was shown on BBC television, Paul McCartney criticised it for being biased against him and in favour of Lennon. He objected to the suggestion that it was McCartney and not Lennon who was responsible for the break-up of the Beatles. McCartney blocked a proposed film version of the musical. ==References== ==Other websites== *Willy Russell site *Discogs Category:Plays by Willy Russell Category:1974 works Category:1970s musicals",
