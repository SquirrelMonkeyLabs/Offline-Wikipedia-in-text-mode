The song was certified 4Ã— Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song has over 1 billion streams on Spotify. The song is about a teen who doesn't want to follow in their parents footsteps. They feel trapped by their overbearing parent and don't feel like they can live up to their expectations. They would rather be their own person instead of what their parent wants them to be. A music video for the song was released. In the video, the band is playing in a church. An outcast girl (played by Briana Evigan) is in class drawing. She gets laughed at by other students after the teacher yells at her for not paying attention. Nobody wants to be near her and nobody helps her when she gets bumped and falls down in the hallway. It's shown that she has scars that spell out NUMB from cutting her forearm. She is shown painting and then runs to the church where the band is playing but they aren't there. The music video has over 2 billion views on YouTube. There was remix released called \"Numb/Encore\" in 2004. It featured American rapper Jay-Z. The remix won Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Grammy Awards. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2003 songs Category:Linkin Park songs",
