 "text": "A chief operating officer (COO), also referred (talked to as) to as a chief operations officer, is one of the most important people in an organization, responsible for making sure that the company they work for is in good condition. The Chief Operating Officer is often the second-in-command at the organization. The Chief Executive Officer is often in control of the organization, and they often are the founder of the organization itself. The COO often reports to their boss, the CEO. == Requirements and different titles == Unlike the CEO position, which is generally thought of as the most important person in an organization, the COO position's name and job description (something described) is usually linked to what the CEO's job is. The selection of a COO is similar to electing a person like the Vice President or Speaker of the House: the more power and responsibility the position holds, the more experience and trust required to get hired to be a COO. There can be more than one COO in a company, such as a company which supplies roofing tiles, or an organization that makes clothes. Companies that make or refine goods naturally need more COO positions. === President === The term \"President and CEO\" is often heard in companies, but the person who uses this term is usually a CEO. COOs often use the \"vice-president\" term to describe themselves. The position of \"President\" is still below the CEO position. ==References== Category:Business occupations",
