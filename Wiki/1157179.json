 "text": "The Kadamba Rebellion was an important event in South Indian history during the 13th century. After Mahadeva, the ruler of the Seuna (Yadava) dynasty, was defeated by the Hoysalas, one of his former vassals, Kadamba king Kavadeva, rebelled against him. Kavadeva, seeking to take advantage of the weakened Seunas, aimed to establish independence for the Kadamba kingdom. This rebellion posed a serious challenge to Mahadeva’s authority. To suppress the uprising, Mahadeva sent his trusted general, Balugideva Saluva, to confront Kavadeva. Balugideva not only defeated the Kadamba forces but also killed Kavadeva, bringing the rebellion to an end. This victory helped restore Seuna control over the region and reinforced Mahadeva’s authority despite earlier setbacks against the Hoysalas. The rebellion and its suppression marked a key moment in the power struggles of medieval South India. ==Battle== During Mahadeva's rule, he decided to expand his kingdom and marched south. As part of his campaign, he first went to the territory of the Kadamba chief, Kavadeva. The Kadambas of Banavasi had been defeated earlier during the reign of Simhana and had become subordinates to the Sola kings. However, during Mahadeva's time, Kavadeva rebelled against the king's authority. This rebellion forced Mahadeva to take action. In April 1268 CE, Mahadeva sent his army, led by his general Baligadeva, to fight Kavadeva. Baligadeva was supported by another commander, Vithala-dandanayaka. An inscription from the same year mentions a battle during which a warrior from the Kadamba side lost his life. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:13th century in India Category:1268",
