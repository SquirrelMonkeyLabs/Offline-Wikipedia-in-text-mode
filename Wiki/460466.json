 "text": "Azerbaijani rock is a type of rock music sung by Azerbaijani people. In the Soviet era, rock music was forbidden because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believed it was a \"Western anti-socialist\" influence. However, in the 1980s popular rock bands in Azerbaijan began to emerge. The Azerbaijanis blended folk music with their rock music. After Bolshevism, progressive rock music began to be popular among Azerbaijani people. Since 2004, the Azerbaijan Music Awards honors musicians who record rock music. == Other websites == * Azerbaijans.com - Music Â» Rock Category:Rock music Category:Azerbaijani music",
