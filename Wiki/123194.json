 "text": "Lachulanga la (el. 5059 m) is a mountain pass on the Leh-Manali highway. It located 54km from Sarchu and 24km from Pang on the Manali Leh highway. This is one of the easier 16000+ passes and it can be traversed cross country by moving along the nala on both sides. However due to lack of greenry in this region, the climbers/hikers face breathlessness during climb and those who have not undergone acclimatisation may face severe symptoms of AMS.
