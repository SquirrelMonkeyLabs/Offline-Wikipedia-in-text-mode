But unfortunately, due to discipline issues, problems with Alcohol, neglecting training and then getting caught when he was driving under the influence of alcohol saw Rutkowski getting kicked out of the national team the following season. He never returned to the ski jumping after that. After that for a very long time it was not known what was happening in his life.
