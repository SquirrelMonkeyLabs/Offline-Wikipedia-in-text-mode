There is a yellow triangle on the head. There is a mark on the head in the shape of a bat with open wings. There are bar stripes on the back legs. The bottoms of the back legs are yellow. The belly is light brown with dark marks. The top of the iris of the eye is gold or yellow-bronze in color with black lines. ==Home== This frog lives in forests with Nothofagus plants where there is water in the air. People see them under logs. Scientists saw it in one protected place: Parque Oncol, which is a private park. They also saw it near an ecological reserve in Llenehue and they think it might live in this park too. Scientists have seen this frog between 400 and 700 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists believe this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole, like other frogs in Alsodes. ==Threats== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Cutting down too many trees and building too many buildings might hurt this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
