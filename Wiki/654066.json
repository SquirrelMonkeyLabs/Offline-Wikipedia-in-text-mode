 "text": "The National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland, was formed in 2006 with the merger of two museums. They were the new Museum of Scotland (Scottish objects, culture and history) and the Royal Museum (science and technology, natural history, and world cultures). The two buildings are next to each other and are connected. They are on Chambers Street, by the George IV Bridge. The museum is part of National Museums Scotland. Admission is free. As well as the national collections, the museum contains artefacts from around the world: geology, archaeology, natural history, science, technology, art, and world cultures. A Scottish invention that is a perennial favourite with school parties is The Maiden, an early form of guillotine. In 2017, the museum received 2,165,601 visitors, Scotland's most popular visitor attraction that year. == References == Category:Museums in the United Kingdom Category:National museums Category:Organisations based in Scotland",
