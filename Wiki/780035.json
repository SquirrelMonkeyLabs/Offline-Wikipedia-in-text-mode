 "text": "Zweifel's big-eyed tree frog (Litoria zweifeli) is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean. Some scientists, for example Paul Menzies, say this frog is closely related to Grant's big-eyed tree frog. This frog was named after the scientist Richard George Zweifel. Zweifel described, or wrote the first formal papers about, many other frogs and wrote many studies about frogs and other amphibians. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
