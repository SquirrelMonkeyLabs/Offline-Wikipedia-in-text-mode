 "text": "x86-64 is the general name of a series of 64-bit processors and their associated instruction set architecture. These processors are compatible with legacy x86 software. AMD and Intel are the major manufacturers, and VIA also supported it with VIA Nano processors. They call their own 64-bit processors AMD64, Intel64 and VIA x86-64 processors, respectively. Game consoles such as Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 use their own semi-customized AMD64-based APU as main processors. x64 is another name used to refer to 64-bit extended systems\"The latter two processor families are called 64-bit extended systems and in this book are referred to as x64.\" on page 37 of WindowsÂ® Internals 6th Part 1 based on this kind of processors. People often use x64 to refer to its associated instruction set architecture and processor. == Desktop Processors == === AMD64 === * AMD Athlon 64 * AMD Athlon X2 * AMD Athlon II * AMD Sempron * AMD Sempron X2 * AMD Phenom * AMD Phenom II * AMD FX * AMD APU A4/A6/A8/A9/A10/A12 * AMD APU Athlon * AMD APU Sempron * AMD Ryzen === Intel 64 (EM64T) === * Intel Pentium 4 * Intel Pentium D * Intel Celeron D * Intel Pentium Dual Core * Intel Celeron * Intel Core 2 * Intel Core i3/i5/i7/i9 * Intel Atom === VIA x86-64 === VIA Nano == Desktop Operating System == Windows XP Professional x64 Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10 x64 Windows 11 (Only x64) Mac OS X 10.4.7 and later Solaris 10 and later Linux 2.4.x and later == References == Category:Computer hardware",
