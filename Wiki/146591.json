 "text": "Bo'ness (short for Borrowstouness) is a town in the Falkirk council area of Scotland, UK. Bo'ness is well known for its iron. Even if Bo'ness is the form of name it's known for and being used on road signs, its original name Borrowstounness. == Name history == The usage of the name dates back to the early 1400s when the Burgh of Linlithgow built a harbour on a broad promontory (or \"ness\"). The \"burgh's town on the ness\" then became Borrowstounness. It eventually became known as Bo'ness. == References == Category:Towns in Falkirk == Other websites == * Bo'ness official railway",
