 "text": "A suggestion is an idea that one suggests, or says is good for another (or others) to follow. Some people may agree to it, and some may disagree. If they disagree or have a different suggestion, the person who first suggested the idea will usually discuss with the other people and find a good conclusion that satisfies both and is good. A suggestion is someone's opinion on how to do any task, but a person is not necessarily expected to do it. == References == Category:Basic English 850 words",
