 "text": "Cayetano Arellano High School, commonly known as Arellano High School, situated Santa Cruz, Manila, Philippines, is one of the oldest public high schools in the city. ==History== The first American-established public high school in Manila was Manila High School which, according to the Philippine National Historical Institute was founded in 1906. In 1921, the Manila city government mandated secondary schools in each of its four districts: Manila North High School, Manila South High School, Manila East High School, and Manila West High School. In June 1930, the schools in each quadrant were renamed after jurists; Cayetano Arellano (North), Manuel Araullo (South), Victorino Mapa (East), and Florentino Torres (West). In line with this, Manila High School was split into two — Manila South High School becoming Manuel Araullo High School and Manila North High School becoming Cayetano Arellano High School. ===Annexes=== * In the years 1945–48, Cayetano Arellano High School had become the largest public school in Manila. The school annexed units to accommodate the growing number of post-liberation students. Units acquired in the La Chambre Building in Binondo, Manila later became the Jose Abad Santos High School. * In 1949, further annexes along Rizal Avenue, Manila were spun off to become the Manuel L. Quezon High School. In 1961, other annexes in Santa Cruz, Manila were integrated to become the Doña Teodora Alonzo High School. ==References== Category:High schools in the Philippines Category:Education in the Philippines",
