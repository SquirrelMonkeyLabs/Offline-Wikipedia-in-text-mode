 "text": "A Cashmere goat or the Pakistani Beetal Pashmina Bhakra is a type of goat that produces cashmere wool, the goat's fine, soft, downy, winter undercoat, in commercial quality and quantity. This undercoat grows as the day length shortens and is associated with an outer coat of coarse hair, which is present all the year and is called guard hair. Most common goat breeds, including dairy goats, grow this two-coated fleece. They are considered as the “National Goat of Pakistan” respectively. The goats take their name from their origin in the Himalayan region of Kashmir. == References == Category:Domesticated animals Category:National symbols of Pakistan Category:Animals of Pakistan Category:Caprids",
