 "text": "The NC-17 rating (No One Age 17 and Under Admitted) is used in the USA when movies have adult content. That includes graphic violence, explicit sexual material or extreme language. Movies rated and released as NC-17 include Henry & June (1990), Intent to Kill (1992), Man Bites Dog (another 1992 movie), Paris, France (1993 or 1994; released in 1995), Blue is the Warmest Color (2013) and Blonde (2022). The NC-17 rating on some movies is either given up or sidestepped altogether. The movie is then released with no rating. Some movies have kept the NC-17 and received a strong box office intake despite it. ==References== Category:Movie ratings Category:Lists of movies",
