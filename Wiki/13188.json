 "text": "Phish is an American rock band. They formed in Vermont in 1983, broke up in 2004, and reformed in 2009. Their lead singer is Trey Anastasio. Phish was often compared to the Grateful Dead, and had a similar following of \"Phish Heads\" following the band on tour. They went on a 5-year-long hiatus from 2004 to 2009. Their hiatus ended when they played shows on March 6, 7 and 8 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, VA. The band surprised the audience with longer sets than usual. Their music has a lot of improvisation, so when they play live, their songs are sometimes a lot longer. They use elements from many genres, including rock, jazz, funk, progressive rock, bluegrass, country, reggae, blues, Latin, and psychedelic rock. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * The White Tape (1986) * The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday (1987) * Junta (1989) * Lawn Boy (1990) * A Picture of Nectar (1992) * Rift (1993) * Hoist (1994) * Billy Breathes (1996) * The Story of the Ghost (1998) * The Siket Disc (1999) * Farmhouse (2000) * Round Room (2002) * Undermind (2004) * Joy (2009) * Fuego (2014) * Big Boat (2016) * Sigma Oasis (2020) * Evolve (2024) ==References== Category:American rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1983 Category:2004 disestablishments in the United States Category:Burlington, Vermont Category:1983 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Vermont",
