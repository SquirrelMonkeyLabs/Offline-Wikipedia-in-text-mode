He became well known in 1960 after his report on the independence of the Congo \"Afrika im Jahre Null\" (\"Africa in Year Zero\"). This included a photo of an African boy standing next to the steel scabbard of Belgian King Baudouin. That picture remains his \"calling card\".Glasenapp, Jörn (2008) '\"Der Degendieb von Léopoldville. Robert Lebecks Schlüsselbild der Dekolonisation Afrikas\" In Paul, Gerhard (ed.)
