 "text": "The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) was a major British railway company before the 1923 Grouping. It was created in 1847 by joining the Manchester and Leeds Railway and a number of smaller railway companies. It was the third largest railway system based in Northern England. Only the Midland Railway and the North Eastern Railway were bigger. It was the first mainline railway to introduce electrification of some of its lines. It also ran steamboat services across the Irish Sea and North Sea. It was a bigger shipowner than any other British railway company. It amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922. One year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway under the Railways Act 1921. ==Related pages== * LYR electric units Category:Pre-grouping British railway companies",
