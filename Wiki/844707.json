 "text": "Rosuvastatin is a statin drug. It is also known by the brand names: Crestor, Sandos (AU), Ezallor, or Rosuvastatin Calcium. It acts by working on the liver to stop it making cholesterol. It starts to work within a week to reduce cholesterol, but it can take up to a month to achieve its full effect. A doctor may prescribe rosuvastatin for diabetes or kidney disease, or if there is family history of rheumatoid arthritis or heart disease. These factors, and having too much cholesterol (such as high LDL), increase risk of heart problems. Rosuvastatin is used to lower high blood cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia). The drug is also used to prevent strokes and cardiovascular disease in people with high risk. Common side effects are abdominal pain, nausea and headaches. Serious side effects, though uncommon, are type 2 diabetes and liver conditions. The drug was patented in 1991. It was approved for medical use in the United States twelve years later. == Related pages == * LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and lDL (little L) * Beta blocker ==References== Category:Statins Category:Organonitrogen compounds Category:Organosulfur compounds Category:Organofluorides",
