The distance between a man's outstreched arms is about a fathom. By this definition, a statute mile is 880 fathoms long. According to the directive 80/181/EWG, one fathom is 1,829 meters long. One fathom is equal to: * 1.8288 metres exactly (1 metre is about 0.5468 fathoms) * 2 yards (1 yard is exactly 0.5 fathoms) * 6 feet (1 foot is about 0.1667 fathoms) * 18 hands * 72 inches In 1959 the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom defined the length of the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metre. With the adoption of the metric SI system the use of fathoms declined. ==References== Category:Imperial units Category:Units of length",
