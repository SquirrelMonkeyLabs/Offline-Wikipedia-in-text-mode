 "text": "Pseudophilautus maia was a frog. It lived in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it exactly one place: Poojagoda Estate. Scientists have seen it 1400 meters above sea level. Unlike other frogs in Pseudophilautus, P. maia had a tympanum, or eardrum, that is easy to see. This frog is extinct. There are none alive now. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down too many trees to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
