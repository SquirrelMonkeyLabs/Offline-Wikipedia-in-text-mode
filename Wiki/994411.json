 "text": "The Century Magazine (officially The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine) was a monthly magazine with pictures. It was first published in the United States in 1881. It was made by The Century Company of New York City to come after Scribner's Monthly Magazine. It ended in 1930 when it was combined with The Forum. The magazine gave readers a mixture of literature, history, current events, and very good illustrations. Every month it printed parts of novels like William Dean Howells's The Rise of Silas Lapham, Jack London's The Sea- Wolf, and Henry James' The Bostonians. It printed a biography of Abraham Lincoln and short writing like \"The Lady or the Tiger?\" and Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus stories. ==References== Category:Magazines published in New York City Category:19th-century monthly magazines",
