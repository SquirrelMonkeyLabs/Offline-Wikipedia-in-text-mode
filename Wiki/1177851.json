 "text": "József Székely József Székely (1 March 1825 – 16 September 1895) was a Hungarian writer, poet, journalist, and archivist. His life and work were deeply rooted in Hungarian culture. ==Early life== József Székely was born on March 1, 1825, in Debrecen, Hungary. He studied at the Protestant College in Debrecen before continuing his education in law at Miskolc and Budapest. He received his law degree in 1847. ==Career== Székely played an active role in the youth movement during the parliamentary sessions of 1847/48 in Pressburg (now Bratislava) and participated in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, which was unsuccessful. After the revolution was suppressed, he turned to journalism and worked for several significant newspapers, including the Pesti Napló and Magyar Sajtó in Vienna. Later, he became an archivist for Pest County. ==Literary work== Székely is known for his poetic works, which often featured a mix of patriotic fervor and vivid imagination. His poems are noted for their lively depictions and sometimes extravagant and picturesque expressions. He also worked occasionally as a translator, translating major literary works from German, French, and English into Hungarian. ==Legend of Szeged Goulash== Székely is associated with the Hungarian national dish known as Szeged Goulash, or Székelykáposzta, which combines sauerkraut, pork, and paprika. It is said that the dish was named after him because he supposedly inspired or popularized it. However, this connection is more of a legend than a documented fact, as there are no historical records directly linking Székely to the creation or introduction of the dish. ==Death== József Székely died on September 16, 1895, in Budapest. His literary and cultural contributions have made him a significant figure in Hungarian literary history. ==Source== *https://www.werwareigentlich.de/szekely-jozsef.shtml",
