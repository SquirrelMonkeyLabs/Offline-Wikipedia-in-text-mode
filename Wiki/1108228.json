 "text": "Chlamydia pneumonia, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae is the most common Chalmydia infection. It is a major cause of pneumonia. It was originally known as the Taiwan acute respiratory agent (TWAR) from the names of the two original isolates â€“ Taiwan (TW-183) and an acute respiratory isolate named AR-39. The first known case of infection with C. pneumoniae was a case of conjunctivitis in Taiwan in 1950. There are no known cases of C. pneumoniae in human history before 1950. Originally it was thought to have been caused by a virus. ==Reproduction and spread == Chlamydia is a bacteria which spreads person to person. It cannot survive or reproduce on its own. Instead it relies on the energy and resources of the body it lives in, because it is a parasite. It infects and causes disease in humans, including previously healthy people. C. pneumoniae also infects koalas, emerald tree boas (Corallus caninus), iguanas, chameleons, frogs, and turtles. == Symptoms == The illness has two phases (also known as biphasic illness). Signs and symptoms include inflammation of the lining of the oropharynx (pharyngitis), hoarseness, an ear infection (called otitis), then followed by pneumonia. This atypical bacterium commonly causes bronchitis, coronary artery disease and atypical pneumonia and several other possible diseases. Chlamydia pneumoniae is thought to be linked to an increased risk of developing lung cancer in the future. ==Related pages== *chlamydia psittaci *MERS == References == Category:Bacteria Category:Diseases caused by bacteria",
