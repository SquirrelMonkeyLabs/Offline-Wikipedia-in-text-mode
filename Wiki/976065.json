 "text": "\"Libya, Libya, Libya\" () is the national anthem of Libya. ==Lyrics== The rewritten third verse is not always sung. Arabic original Transliteration IPA transcription English translation O my country, o my country, With my struggle and gladiatorial patience, Drive off all enemies' plots and mishaps Be saved, be saved, be saved Be saved all the way We are your sacrifices Libya, Libya, Libya! I O my country, You're the heritage of my ancestors May Allah not bless any hand that tries to harm you Be saved, we are for ever your soldiers No matter the death toll if you've been saved Take from us the most credential oaths, We won't let you down, Libya We will never be enchained again We are free and have freed our homeland Libya, Libya, Libya! II Our grandfathers stripped a fine determination When the call for struggle was made They marched carrying Qur'an in one hand, and their weapons by the other hand The universe is then full of faith and purity The world is then a place of goodness and godliness Eternity is for our grandfathers They have honoured this homeland Libya, Libya, Libya! III Hail Al Mukhtar, the prince of conquerors He is the symbol of struggle and Jihad He raises our flag high And we follow him, freeing our homeland, He was praised with glory and conquest manifest And raises hope for Libya in heaven, A free flag Over a rich country, Libya, Libya, Libya. IV O son of Libya, O son of lions of the wild We're for honour and the honours are for us Since we began struggling, people all over praised May Allah bless our Independence So seek height as a quality in mankind Our cubs, be prepared for the foreseen battles Our youths, to prevail Life is only a struggle for homeland Libya, Libya, Libya! ===Berber version=== Berber lyrics (Tifinagh) Berber lyrics (Latin) ==References== Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of Libya",
