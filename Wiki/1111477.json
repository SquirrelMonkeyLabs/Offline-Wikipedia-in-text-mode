 "text": "Transudates are fluids that pass through a membrane or squeeze through tissue or into the extracellular space of tissues. Transudates are thin and watery and contain few cells or proteins. To tell exudates apart from transudates, the patient's serum is taken and tested. If total protein is normal and the pleural fluid protein is < (less) than 25g/L the fluid is a transudate. Also, if the pleural fluid protein is > (higher) than 35g/L the fluid is an exudate. Transudate is usually clear also. The appearance is used in diagnosing the liquid when it comes out before testing. ==Related pages== * chemistry * exudate * immune system ==References== Category:Physiology",
