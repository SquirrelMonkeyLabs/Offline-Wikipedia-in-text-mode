This is what most people will associate with 'sauce chasseur'. == History == Chasseur is named after the French word for \"hunter\", hinting at the traditional pairings of mushrooms with venison, rabbit, wild fowl, and other game meats. Traditionally, while returning from the hunt, the hunters picked the mushrooms they would use to prepare the game meat. Chasseur is thought to have been invented by Philippe de Mornay, who is also said to have invented Mornay sauce, BÃ©chamel, sauce Lyonnaise and sauce Porto.History of Sauces ==References== Category:Sauces",
