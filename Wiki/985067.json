 "text": "Roy Thomas Baker (born 10 November 1946) is an English record producer, songwriter and arranger. He helped create a series of extremely popular pop and rock records from the 1970s to the present day. Although he was born in London, England, he now divides his time between his homes in Los Angeles, Europe, and his recording studio in Arizona. Baker started at Decca Records in England at the age of 14. He later moved to Trident Studios, where he worked with the likes of Gus Dudgeon and Tony Visconti. ==Works== One of his best known productions is the hit song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen. He also produced artists such as Nazareth, Guns N' Roses, The Who, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, The Cars, Foreigner, Journey, Pilot, Ozzy Osbourne, Mötley Crüe, T. Rex, Devo, The Stranglers, Dusty Springfield, Starcastle, T'Pau, Yes, Cheap Trick, Gasolin' and The Darkness. Most recently he has worked with The Smashing Pumpkins on their 2007 album Zeitgeist. In 2008 he produced in his Arizona recording studio \"The Storm\" which has become a gold record. In 2008 he produced a track on the Smashing Pumpkins EP American Gothic. According to Jimmy Chamberlin, the only times Baker complained during the making of Zeitgeist were when he was denied permission to build a helipad on his California mansion and when he had to sell a castle he owned in England. ==Discography== Roy Thomas Baker put production on: *Arnold Corns: \"Man in the Middle\" (1971 – released 1985) *Free: Fire and Water (1970) *Nazareth: Nazareth (engineer) (1971) *Nazareth: Exercises (1972) *Gasolin': Gasolin' 3 (1973) *Gasolin': Stakkels Jim (in English: \"Poor Jim\") (1974) *Queen: Queen (1973) (Credited as Roy Baker) *Queen: Queen II (1974) *Hawkwind: Hall of the Mountain Grill (1974) *Robert Calvert: Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters (1974) *Man : Rhinos, Winos and Lunatics (1974) *The Trammps: ‘’The Legendary Zing Album’’ (1975) *Queen: Sheer Heart Attack (1974) *Queen: A Night at the Opera (1975) *Jet: Jet (1975) *Be-Bop Deluxe: Futurama (1975) *Gasolin': Gas 5 (1975) *Lewis Furey: The Humours Of (1976) *Pilot: Morin Heights (1976) *Ian Hunter: Overnight Angels (1976) *Gasolin': Efter endnu en dag (1976) *Starcastle: Fountains of Light (1977) *Starcastle: Citadel (1977) *Dusty Springfield It Begins Again (1978) *The Cars: The Cars (1978) *Queen: Jazz (1978) *Journey: Infinity (1978) *Journey: Evolution (1979) *Yes: Paris Sessions aka Golden Age Sessions (1979; unreleased) *Ron Wood: Gimme Some Neck (1979) *The Cars: Candy-O (1979) *Foreigner: Head Games (1979) *Alice Cooper: Flush the Fashion (1980) *The Cars: Panorama (1980) *The Cars: Shake It Up (1981) *Heavy Metal: \"Motion Picture Soundtrack\" (1982) *Cheap Trick: One on One (1982) *Devo: Oh, No!
