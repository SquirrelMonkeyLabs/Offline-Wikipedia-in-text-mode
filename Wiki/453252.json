 "text": "Snot is an American hardcore punk band from Santa Barbara, California. Snot was formed in 1995 by lead singer Lynn Strait and guitarist Mike Doling. The band then signed with Geffen Records and worked on their debut album Get Some which was released on May 27, 1997. Snot performed on the Ozzfest 1998 tour. Lead singer Lynn Strait was arrested for indecent exposure in Mansfield, Massachusetts on July 9, 1998 after he was dared by singer Fred Durst to exit nude from the oversized toilet prop that was used by Limp Bizkit in their performances. Strait along with his boxer and band mascot Dobbs died in a six- car crash on December 11, 1998 after a pickup truck struck his car. The band would then disband after his death. The band would reunite and disband many times afterwards. Their latest reunion was on February 11, 2014 at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood. == Band members == ;Original *Lynn Strait — Vocals (1995–1998) (†) *Mike Doling – Guitar (1995–1998, 2008–2011) *Sonny Mayo – drums (1995–1998, 2008–2009) *John Fahnestock – Bass (1995–1998, 2008–2011) *Jamie Miller – Drums (1996–1998, 2008–2011) ;Others *James Fed Carrol - drums (1995-1996) *Shannon Larkin - drums (1998) *Mike Smith - guitar (1998) *Tommy Vext - vocals (2008–2009) *Brandon Espinoza - vocals (2009–2010) == Discography == ===Albums=== *Get Some (1997) *Strait Up (2000) *Alive!
