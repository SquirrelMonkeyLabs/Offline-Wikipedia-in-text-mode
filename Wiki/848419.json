 "text": "Zohra Shah () was an eight-year-old Pakistani domestic worker (or slave) of a married couple, Hassan Siddiqui and Umme Kulsoom. She was tortured and killed for mistakenly releasing her employersâ€™ parrots in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi on 1 June 2020. Her death caused an outcry in Pakistan and led to legislative changes which outlawed child domestic labour in the country. == Early life == She was from Basti Maso Shah in Muzaffargarh District of southern Punjab approximately 580 kilometres from the capital, Islamabad. == Murder == Allegedly, she was murdered for releasing valuable parrots from their cages. Evidence such as 'older scars and marks' suggest Shah had been repeatedly abused while working for Siddiqui and Kulsoom, and 'wounds on her thighs' were 'consistent with sexual assault'. == Aftermath == Siddiqui and Kulsoom were arrested and put on judicial remand. == References == Category:2020 crimes Category:2020 in Pakistan Category:Child sexual abuse Category:Torture victims Category:2012 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Children victims of violence Category:Murdered children Category:People murdered in Pakistan",
