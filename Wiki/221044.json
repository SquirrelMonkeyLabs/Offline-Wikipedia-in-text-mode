 "text": "\"Some Enchanted Evening\" is the thirteenth and final episode of the first season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on the Fox network on May 13, 1990. Although it was the first episode made, it started on television as the season finale because of many animation problems. In the episode, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie meet the notorious \"Babysitter Bandit\". After answering a marital dilemma, Homer and Marge want to spend a night on the town so they need a babysitter to look after their children. They hire Ms. Botz through a babysitting service. Ms. Botz is later known to be the \"Babysitter Bandit\" and after tying up Bart and Lisa, she robs the family. The episode has references to such films as \"The Night of the Hunter\" and \"Psycho\" as well as a musical reference to \"A Star Is Born.\" It got some good and bad reviews; some people thought it the best episode of the season, while others thought it was the season's worst. == Other websites == * * * Category:1990 television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 1) episodes",
