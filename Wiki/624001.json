The first of these reports were published in June 2013. The reports were about the United States and British global surveillance programs. They were based on classified documents disclosed by Edward Snowden. Greenwald and the team he worked with won both a George Polk Award and a Pulitzer Prize for these reports. Greenwald has written several best-selling books, including, No Place to Hide. Greenwald's work on the Snowden story was featured in the documentary, Citizenfour, which won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Greenwald appeared on-stage with director Laura Poitras and Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsey Mills, when the Oscar was given. In the 2016 Oliver Stone feature film Snowden, Greenwald was played by actor Zachary Quinto.
