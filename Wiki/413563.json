The actual position of the waitline can be different depending on the fashion or how the person chooses to wear the garment, but it is normally just above the hips. Waistlines can be secured with a variety of methods, such as buttons, knots and zippers. A waistband is a strip of elastic rubber that adjusts to keep the item tight against the body.
