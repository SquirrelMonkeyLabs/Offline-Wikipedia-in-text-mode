 "text": "The Bush Doctrine is a term which many people use to describe several foreign policy and national defense decisions that President George W. Bush made. The Bush Doctrine is usually used to describe how Bush invaded Iraq in what is known as pre-emptive war (which means to attack the enemy before they can attack you). George W. Bush did not make up this term and he never said what he thought about the term. There are other United States presidential doctrines also. Category:Foreign relations of the United States",
