 "text": "The Sui Dynasty (, ) was an imperial dynasty of China between the years 581 and 618. It followed the \"Jin period\" and was followed by the Tang Dynasty. It ended nearly four centuries of division between rival regimes. The Sui Dynasty was founded by Emperor Wen, or Yang Jian. Its capital was Chang'an (present- day Xi'an). The dynasty is important because it reunited Southern and Northern China and the Grand Canal was built in that time. ==Related pages== *History of China ==References== ==Other websites== *Sui Dynasty at mnsu.edu Category:Chinese dynasties Category:Establishments in China Category:7th- century disestablishments in Asia Category:6th-century establishments in Asia Category:Disestablishments in China",
