 "text": "Mantellidae is a family of the order Anura. These frogs are found only in Madagascar and Mayotte. These frogs are very different from each other. Most species live on land, though some live in trees. Body size ranges from 3 to 10 centimetres in length. The genus Mantella has many similarities with the South American poison dart frogs. They are small, aposematically coloured, and secrete alkaloid toxins. Some members of this group are kept as pets due to their bright colors. ==References== Category:Frogs of Africa",
