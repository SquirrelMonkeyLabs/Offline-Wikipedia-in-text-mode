It is situated 9 miles north of the county town of Shrewsbury. ==History== The name of the town comes from the Old English \"wamm\", meaning a marsh, as a lot of marshy land exists in the area of the town. Over time, this formed the name \"Wem\". The area now known as Wem is believed to have been inhabited by the Cornovii, Celtic Iron Age settlers, before the Roman Conquest of Britain. The town is recorded in the Domesday Book as consisting of four manors in the hundred of Hodnet. In 1202, Wem became a market town. Now, the town has a population of 5,142. Each year, Wem holds a traditional town carnival which is held on the first Saturday of September, as well as the Sweet Pea Festival on the third weekend of July. ==Transportation== The town has a small railway station on the Welsh Marches line that provides direct trains to Crewe, Manchester and Shrewsbury. The town also has a semi-professional football club, Wem Town FC. ==Gallery== File:St_Peter_and_St_Paul's_Church,_Wem.jpg|Anglican Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wem File:Wem_Shropshire_High_Street.jpg|Wem High Street File:Creamore Grove, Wem.jpg|Creamore Grove, Wem Category:Towns in Shropshire Category:Market towns in England",
