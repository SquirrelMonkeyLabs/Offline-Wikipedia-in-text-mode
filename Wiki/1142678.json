 "text": "The Bilsa white-chested frog (Leucostethus bilsa) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 21.7–24.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 27.4–28.2 mm. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color, darker brown to gray with some black marks. The sides are brown to black in color with a cream-white stripe on each side from the middle of the body to the rear end. The black color stops at a stripe between the white belly and the yellow color where the legs (all four) meet the body). The adult frog has a white belly, but it can have gray spots on the throat and chest. The male frog's male organs can be white or gray in color. The upper lip is cream-white in color with some light gray. The upper parts of the feet are brown in color with three dark brown bands and one line.The bottoms of the feet are yellow. Other parts of the frog are light brown in color. The iris of the eye is yellow-gold in color with some copper or brown, with some small black marks. ==Name== Scientists named this frog for the place where they saw it: Bilsa Biological Reserve. People named the reserve for the Bilsa River. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. Scientists saw it in forests that had never been cut down and forests that had been cut down and are growing back. They saw the frog on the dead leaves on the ground, near streams. Scientists saw it in the Bilsa Biological Reserve. Scientists saw them between 426 and 515 meters above sea level. ==Young== After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to streams. Scientists see the tadpoles in the water from August to June, so they think the frog lays eggs all year. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. They think it only lives in one small piece of forest. Human beings cut down the rest of the forest to get wood to build with, to make palm oil farms, and make places for cows to eat grass. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
