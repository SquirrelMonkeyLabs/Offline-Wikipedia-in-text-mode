After retiring from his teaching job, Coker was still a director of a think tank of LSE until his death. == Ideas and research == In a 2019 book, Coker investigated how Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin challenge the Weste with ideas of civilizational states. In a 2021 book, Coker said that war is the result of human nature. Therefore, he believed that human will not see the end of war until it runs out its evolutionary possibilities. == Single-authored books == * Why War?
