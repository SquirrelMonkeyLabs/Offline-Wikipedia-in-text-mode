 "text": "Saiph is the sixth-brightest star in the constellation of Orion. It is the star at the South-Eastern corner of Orion. When viewing Orion from the northern hemisphere, Saiph would be found in the lower left of Orion. A southern hemisphere viewer would find Saiph in the upper right section of the constellation. Parallax measurements have found that Saiph is about 650 light years away from the sun, which is about the same as Betelgeuse. Although being smaller and less bright, Saiph has a hotter surface than Rigel. == References == Category:Stars",
