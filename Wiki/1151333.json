 "text": "Brownie (born 2015) is a Chilean mixed breed dog, known for being the family pet of the president of Chile, Gabriel Boric, gaining popularity during the electoral campaign of said candidate and after his election . == Biography == He was born in Punta Arenas in 2015, and as a 45-day-old puppy he was adopted by Tomás —Gabriel Boric's brother—, who picked him up from a house in Punta Arenas that was giving away dogs from a new litter ; He was chosen because he had an injury on one of his hind legs and was limping, which is why he had not been chosen by other people for adoption. The Boric family chose the name Brownie for the dog, whose fur is brown, because this food is one of the family members' favorite dishes. According to members of the Boric family, he is characterized by being \"a curious dog who likes to go out and explore\", which is why he has also been called \"the libertarian dog\"; As a result of this situation, on September 24, 2019 he got lost in the streets of Punta Arenas and was found the next day. Brownie is also described as a \"clumsy but well-intentioned\" and \"friendly and gentle\" dog who has a special bond with Gabriel Boric's mother—María Soledad Font—and, being a dog raised in the Magallanes region, is accustomed to the cold and sleeps in a doghouse in the yard of his caretakers' home. He gained notoriety on June 18, 2021, when he was present at the launch of Gabriel Boric's campaign for the Apruebo Dignidad presidential primaries, held on the Costanera in Punta Arenas. He subsequently appeared in different chapters of the electoral segment broadcast on television, and on the day of the presidential election (December 19, 2021) his presence at the entrance of Boric's house caused the presidential candidate - who was on his way to the vehicle that would take him to his voting place in Punta Arenas - to deviate from his route to caress him and say goodbye to him. Following Gabriel Boric's victory in the presidential election in December 2021, different names for Brownie emerged as the pet of the president-elect; among the names installed are \"First Dog of the Republic\", \"First Presidential Dog\" and \"First Dog of the Nation\". On December 21, 2021, the official accounts of the dog were created on the social networks Instagram and Twitter, reaching more than 110 thousand followers in the first hours and 247 thousand the next day; It is sought that with these accounts it is possible to generate awareness about the care of animals . There was also speculation about his possible transfer to Santiago and to the Palacio de La Moneda (seat of government) to accompany the president, which was ruled out as he is a dog that is cared for by the entire Boric Font family in Punta Arenas. == Related pages == *List of Presidential dogs of Chile == References == == Other websites == * * Category:Individual dogs Category:Pets of world leaders",
