 "text": "The dancing plague (or dance epidemic) of 1518 was a massive case of dancing mania that happened in Strasbourg, Alsace (now modern-day France), in the Holy Roman Empire. In July of 1518, somewhere between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for days. The outbreak began in July 1518 when one woman began to dance randomly in a street in Strasbourg. Some sources claim that, for a short time, the plague killed around fifteen people per day. However, the sources of the city of Strasbourg at the time of the events did not mention the number of deaths, or even if there were any deaths. All evidence points to mass hysteria caused by people seeing the first woman dance. ==References== Category:1518",
