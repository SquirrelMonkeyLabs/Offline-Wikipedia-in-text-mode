 "text": "Steiner's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus steineri) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Corbett's Gap in Knuckles Hills, between 1100 and 1400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 30.2 – 31.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 30.4 – 41.6 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is green in color with blank marks. The sides of the frog are gray-green in color. There is a brown mark between the eyes. Parts of the mouth are white with brown marks. Some parts of the back legs are green in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
