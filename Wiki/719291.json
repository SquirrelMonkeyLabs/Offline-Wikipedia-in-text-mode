 "text": "Bee Movie is a 2007 comedy movie made by DreamWorks Animation. It is about a bee attempting to restore flowers for honey. == Plot == The main character is Barry B. Benson, who is a bee. Barry leaves his beehive for a job and meets a woman called Vanessa. They both become friends and when they are at the shop, Barry sees honey and realises that humans have been stealing their honey, so he and Vanessa go to court to give all of the honey back to the bees. After they win the lawsuit, all bees lose their jobs and the flowers start dying because they aren't getting pollinated by the bees. Barry and Vanessa go to the flower parade (where the last alive flowers are), steal a festival car and bring it into a plane. They want to bring the flowers back to the bees to make the flowers alive again. Vanessa is forced to fly the plane with the help of Barry halfway through the flight and successfully lands with the help of the bees. In the end, they manage to pollinate the flowers, make the nature alive again and all bees get their jobs back. == Voice cast == * Jerry Seinfeld as Barry B.
