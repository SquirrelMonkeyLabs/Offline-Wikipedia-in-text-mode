She did not regain her citizenship until 1944. Her husband died in 1959. She died on January 21, 1984 at the Leila Y. Post Montgomery Hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan. ==References== ==Other websites== *Rebecca Shelley papers at the University of Michigan Category:1887 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Nonviolence advocates",
