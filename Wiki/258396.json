 "text": "Serena Deeb (born June 29, 1986) is an American professional wrestler currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW). She is best known for wrestling with World Wrestling Entertainment on their SmackDown brand under the ring name, Serena, where she was part of CM Punk's wrestling stable Straight Edge Society. While part of Ohio Valley Wrestling, Serena was won the OVW Women's Championship six times and was named Queen of FCW one time while part of Florida Championship Wrestling. Serena was released from her WWE contract for not portraying her Straight Edge Society gimmick in real life, but because SmackDown was pre-recorded, her release was not revealed immediately, and gave her one last appearance on WWE programming which aired on August 27, 2010. She returned in 2017 to compete in the Mae Young Classic. She then became a coach at the Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. She was released for a second time on April 15, 2020, and joined AEW that September. Deeb also works as a yoga teacher. == Championships and accomplishments == * Florida Championship Wrestling ** Queen of FCW (1 time) * Great Lakes Championship Wrestling ** GLCW Ladies Championship (1 time) * International Catch Wrestling Alliance ** NWA France Women's Championship (1 time) * Memphis Championship Wrestling ** MCW Women's Championship (1 time) * National Wrestling Alliance ** NWA World Women's Championship (1 time) * Ohio Valley Wrestling ** OVW Women's Championship (6 times) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** Ranked No. 11 in the top 150 female wrestlers in the PWI Women's 150 in 2021 ** Ranked No. 16 of the top 50 female wrestlers in the PWI Female 50 in 2011 * Wrestling New Classic ** WNC Women's Championship (1 time) ** WNC Women's Championship League (2013) == References == == Other websites == * Serena on WWE.com (archived) Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:All Elite Wrestling people Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Female professional wrestlers Category:Former WWE wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from Virginia",
