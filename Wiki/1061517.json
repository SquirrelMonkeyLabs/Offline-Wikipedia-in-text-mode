 "text": "WrestleDream (2023) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It took place on October 1, 2023 at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, Washington. It was the first WrestleDream event held by AEW. The event was held as a tribute show for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) founder Antonio Inoki on the one-year anniversary of his death. The main event of the show saw Christian Cage defeat Darby Allin in a two out of three falls match to keep his AEW TNT Championship. During the match, Cage ended up spearing the referee. He would pick up his TNT Championship and go to hit Allin with it but had the title taken away by Nick Wayne. Wayne then hit Allin with the title himself and turned heel. Cage then got the pinfall victory on Allin for his second fall. The event was also notable for the debut of Adam Copeland, previously known as Edge for 25 years in WWE. He saved Sting from a beatdown from Christian Cage, Nick Wayne, and Luchasaurus. In the post-event media scrum, it was announced by AEW owner Tony Khan that Copeland had signed a contract to compete full-time with AEW. ==Matches== No. Results Stipulations Times 1 Athena, Billie Starkz, Keith Lee, and Satoshi Kojima defeated Shane Taylor Promotions (Lee Moriarty and Shane Taylor), Diamanté, and Mercedes Martinez) Eight-person mixed tag team match 5:45 2 Claudio Castagnoli (with Jon Moxley) defeated Josh Barnett Singles match 8:15 3 Luchasaurus defeated Nick Wayne Singles match 4:55 4 Billy Gunn and The Acclaimed (Anthony Bowens and Max Caster) (c) defeated TMDK (Bad Dude Tito, Mikey Nicholls, and Shane Haste) Trios match for the AEW World Trios Championship 9:20 5 MJF (c) defeated The Righteous (Dutch and Vincent) 2-on-1 handicap match for the ROH World Tag Team Championship 9:40 6 Eddie Kingston (c) defeated Katsuyori Shibata Singles match for the ROH World Championship and Strong Openweight Championship 11:00 7 Kris Statlander (c) defeated Julia Hart (with Brody King) Singles match for the AEW TBS Championship 9:00 8 The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) defeated The Lucha Brothers (Penta El Zero Miedo and Rey Fenix) (with Alex Abrahantes), The Gunns (Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn), and Orange Cassidy and Hook Four-way tag team match for a AEW World Tag Team Championship match in the future 12:40 9 Swerve Strickland (with Prince Nana) defeated \"Hangman\" Adam Page Singles match 20:15 10 Ricky Starks defeated Wheeler Yuta Singles match 9:55 11 Bryan Danielson defeated Zack Sabre Jr. Singles match 22:45 12 The Don Callis Family (Konosuke Takeshita, Will Ospreay, and Sammy Guevara) (with Don Callis) defeated Chris Jericho and The Golden Elite (Kenny Omega and Kota Ibushi) Trios match 22:35 13 FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) (c) defeated Aussie Open (Kyle Fletcher and Mark Davis) Tag team match 20:25 14 Christian Cage (c) defeated Darby Allin 2–1 Two out of three falls match for the AEW TNT Championship 25:25 ==References== Category:2023 in sports Category:2023 in the United States Category:All Elite Wrestling shows Category:Sports in Seattle",
