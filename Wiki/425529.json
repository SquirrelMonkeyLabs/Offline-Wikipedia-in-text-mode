 "text": "\"She's Out of My Life\" is a song written by American songwriter Tom Bahler and performed by American singer Michael Jackson from his album Off the Wall, released in 1979. The song is a poignant ballad about heartbreak and loss, exploring themes of love and longing. Michael Jackson's emotive vocal delivery adds to the song's emotional authenticity. == Music video == A music video was produced to promote the song, which showed Michael in a blue-green shirt, dark pants, and sitting on a barstool with a spotlight shining behind him. The video uses a split screen technique to simultaneously show Jackson from two different angles during the second and third verses. It was directed by Bruce Gowers, who also directed a similar video for Jackson's previous single \"Rock with You\". The video is shown far less frequently than Jackson's later videos, but it is included on the DVD box set Michael Jackson's Vision, marking its first DVD release.",
