Local Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70 Its pattern of two-tier councils remains in use today in large parts of England, although the metropolitan county councils were abolished in 1986 and it was replaced with unitary authorities in many areas in the 1990s. In Wales, it established a similar pattern of counties and districts.Arnold-Baker, C., Local Government Act 1972, (1973) These have since been entirely replaced with a system of unitary authorities. In Scotland, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 established a similar system of two-tier regions and districts in 1975 â€“ this was also replaced by a system of unitary council areas in 1996. Elections were held to the new authorities in 1973, and they acted as 'shadow authorities' until the handover date. Elections to county councils were held on April 12, for metropolitan and Welsh districts on May 10 for non-metropolitan district councils on June 7.The Times, April 13, May 11, June 8, 1973 ==England== === Metropolitan counties === Metropolitan county Existing geographic county or subdivision County boroughs Other parts Greater Manchester Cheshire Stockport urban north-east Cheshire Greater Manchester Lancashire Bury, Bolton, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Wigan urban south-east Lancashire Greater Manchester Yorkshire, West Riding none Saddleworth urban district Merseyside Cheshire Birkenhead, Wallasey most of Wirral peninsula Merseyside Lancashire Bootle, Liverpool, St Helens, Southport urban south-west Lancashire South Yorkshire Yorkshire, West Riding Barnsley, Doncaster, Sheffield, Rotherham southern West Riding South Yorkshire Finningley Tyne and Wear Durham Gateshead, South Shields, Sunderland urban north-east Durham Tyne and Wear Northumberland Tynemouth, Newcastle upon Tyne urban south-east Northumberland West Midlands Staffordshire Dudley, Walsall, West Bromwich, Wolverhampton Aldridge-Brownhills West Midlands Warwickshire Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull Sutton Coldfield, Meriden Gap West Midlands Worcestershire Warley Halesowen and Stourbridge West Yorkshire Yorkshire, West Riding Bradford, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds, Wakefield western West Riding of Yorkshire ===Metropolitan districts=== Metropolitan county Metropolitan district County boroughs Other components Greater Manchester Bury Bury Prestwich, Radcliffe, Ramsbottom (part), Tottington, Whitefield (Lancashire) Greater Manchester Bolton Bolton Blackrod, Farnworth, Horwich, Kearsley, Little Lever, Turton (part), Westhoughton (Lancashire) Greater Manchester Manchester Manchester Ringway from Bucklow Rural District (Cheshire) Greater Manchester Oldham Oldham Chadderton, Shaw and Crompton, Failsworth, Lees and Royton (Lancashire);

A further eighteen districts were added in the final proposals of November 1972, which were then ordered. The splits were as follows (in most cases the splits were not exact, and many other changes to the borders of the districts took place at this time) *Devon: Torridge/North Devon *Dorset : Weymouth and Portland/Purbeck, North Dorset/East Dorset *Durham : Wear Valley/Teesdale *Hereford and Worcester : Hereford/South Herefordshire/Leominster *Humberside: Holderness/North Wolds *Isle of Wight: South Wight/Medina *Lancashire: Hyndburn/Rossendale *Leicestershire : Rutland/Melton, Harborough/Oadby and Wigston *Lincolnshire: Boston/South Holland *Northamptonshire: Daventry/South Northamptonshire *Northumberland : Berwick-upon-Tweed/Alnwick *Shropshire : Oswestry/North Shropshire, Bridgnorth/South Shropshire *Somerset: Taunton Deane/West Somerset *Suffolk: Forest Heath The new district in Suffolk was necessitated by the decision to keep Newmarket in Suffolk; which would otherwise have become part of the South Cambridgeshire district. ===Isles of Scilly=== Section 265 af the Act allowed for the continuation of the local government arrangements for the Isles of Scilly. The Isles of Scilly Rural District Council became the Council of the Isles of Scilly, and certain services were to continue to be provided by Cornwall County Council as provided by order in council made by the Secretary of State, although the Isles were not technically in Cornwall before or after 1974. ==Wales== New county Existing geographic county County boroughs Other parts Clwyd Flintshire none all Clwyd Denbighshire none all except Llanrwst and area Clwyd Merionethshire none Edeyrnion Rural District Dyfed Cardiganshire none all Dyfed Carmarthenshire none all Dyfed Pembrokeshire none all Gwent Monmouthshire Newport except parts in Mid Glamorgan and South Glamorgan Gwent Breconshire none Brynmawr and Llanelly Gwynedd Anglesey none all Gwynedd Caernarvonshire none all Gwynedd Merionethshire none all except Edeyrnion Rural District Gwynedd Denbighshire none Llanrwst and area Mid Glamorgan Glamorgan Merthyr Tydfil Aberdare, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Pontypridd, Rhondda etc. Mid Glamorgan Breconshire none Penderyn and Vaynor Mid Glamorgan Monmouthshire none Bedwas and Machen, Rhymney, part of Bedwellty Powys Montgomeryshire none all Powys Radnorshire none all Powys Breconshire none all except parts to Gwent and Mid Glamorgan South Glamorgan Glamorgan Cardiff Barry, Cowbridge, Penarth South Glamorgan Monmouthshire none St Mellons West Glamorgan Glamorgan Swansea Glyncorrwg, Neath, Llwchwr, Port Talbot ==Elections== Elections were held to the new authorities on three different Thursdays in 1973. Each new county and district was divided into electoral divisions. For county councils, each electoral division elected one member; for metropolitan district councils, each ward elected three members; and wards in non-metropolitan districts could elect a varying number of members. There was not sufficient time to conduct a full warding arrangement so a temporary system was used: in some county councils electoral divisions elected multiple councillors.Wood, Bruce.
