He left school in 1919. He continued to develop his art skills in Geneva where he enrolled at the École des Arts Industriels. He travelled to Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Here, he was influenced by the collections of Egyptian art he studied. African and Oceanic art also inspired him. He also focused on the surrealism of art. Example of this are Suspended Ball and The Palace at 4 a.m. From 1922, he lived and worked mainly in Paris. He regularly visited his hometown Borgonovo to see his family and to work on his art. In 1940, Giacometti and his brother, Diego, went to the south of France to escape Nazi invasion. He returned to Paris in 1941. He died on 11 January 1966.
