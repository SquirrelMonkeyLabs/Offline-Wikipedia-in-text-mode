Each episode runs for about 40 minutes. The series is loosely based on a Star Trek related theme. It is based on material by Gene Roddenberry. His widow, Majel Barrett, helped produce it. As of 2021, Andromeda is one of two TV series (the other is Earth: Final Conflict) based on ideas Roddenberry had as early as the 1960s and 1970s. Roddenberry died in 1991, nine years before the series premiere. The name \"Dylan Hunt\" was used for the hero of two TV pilots Roddenberry had produced in the mid-1970s, Genesis II, and Planet Earth. Both had a similar setting. == Related pages == *A for Andromeda tv series, 2006 film and book.
