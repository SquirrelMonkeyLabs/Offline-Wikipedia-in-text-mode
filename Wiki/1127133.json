 "text": "Scrub Daddy is a line of cleaning products made by Scrub Daddy, Inc. Their best known product is a sponge in the shape of a smiley face. Most of their products are made of a polymer that becomes hard in cold water and soft in warm water. As of 2019, Scrub Daddy made more money than any other product shown on Shark Tank, a reality TV series created by ABC. == History == While he was working as a car cleaner, Aaron Krause damaged the outside of a car, so he started a company that made cleaning pads. In August 2008, 3M bought his company, but not the sponges, which were not sold. Four years later, he realized they could be successful after he used them to clean his dishes and lawn furniture. Scrub Daddy, Inc. was founded in 2012. In October that year, Aaron was on Shark Tank, of which Lori Greiner gave him $200,000 to own 20% of the company. The next day, they sold 42,000 sponges in under seven minutes on QVC. Greiner then helped Scrub Daddy to be sold in stores such as Bed Bath & Beyond. In January 2017, Scrub Daddy, Inc. reached $100 million in sales, more than any other Shark Tank product. As of October 2019, the company had sold $209 million of products. In Season 14 Episode 13, it was said that Scrub Daddy had 273 employees and 160 products, which were sold in 257,000 retail locations. They were also one of the five companies on Shark Tank to have made the most money, with more than $670 million in sales. == Products == === Scrub Daddy === Scrub Daddy is made from a strong polymer.
