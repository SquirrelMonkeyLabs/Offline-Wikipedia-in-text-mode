 "text": "On March 24, 1998, at 12:40 pm, a mass shooting occurred at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, United States. At least 5 people were killed and many others injured. The shooters were later identified by police as 13-year-old Mitchell Johnson and 11-year-old Andrew Golden, who were students from the school. The incident was the third fatal mass shooting at an American school since October 1997, following the Pearl High and the Heath High School shootings. Then-President Bill Clinton ordered Attorney General Janet Reno to organize experts on school violence to analyze the recent incidents, determine what they may have had in common and what steps could be taken to reduce the chance of a similar incident. On August 11, 1998, Johnson and Golden were convicted of the shooting. As they were under 14, they couldn't be given the maximum sentence according to Arkansas law. As a result, both boys were sentenced to confinement until they reached the age of 21, which was the maximum sentence available under Arkansas law. They would have served until age 18 had federal authorities not added additional confinement for weapons charges. ==Victims== * Shannon Wright, 32 * Stephanie Johnson, 12 * Natalie Brooks, 11 * Paige Ann Herring, 12 * Brittney Varner, 11 == References == Category:1998 in the United States Category:1990s murders in the United States Category:20th century in Arkansas Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Massacres in the United States",
