 "text": "The Chagos Archipelago ( or ) or Chagos Islands (formerly the Bassas de Chagas, and later the Oil Islands) is a group of seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. The atolls are made up of more than 60 individual islands. The islands are located about south of Maldives. The International community has a strong consensus that the islands are part of Mauritius, but nevertheless, they remain illegally occupied by the United Kingdom, which rents out the islands to the US for a military base. On 25 February 2019, in an advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice found that the United Kingdom illegally separated the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius after its independence in 1968. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on May 22, 2019, commanding Great Britain to return the Chagos Archipelago to the Republic of Mauritius within six months, which would allow Chagossians to recover their land, but Great Britain refused to comply. On 3 October 2024, the UK Government made a joint statement with the Mauritian government that they had negotiated for the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands following two years of negotiation whilst still enabling the running of the American military base in occupied Diego Garcia. Chagossians werenâ€™t directly involved in the negotiations. Following resumed negotiations a treaty was signed on 22 May 2025 that will formally transfer the sovereignty of the territory to Mauritius once it comes into effect, while the Diego Garcia military base remains under British control during a 99-year lease. ==Related pages== *Chagossians ==References== Category:Archipelagos Category:Territorial disputes Category:Islands of Asia Category:British Indian Ocean Territory",
