 "text": "The Scramble for Africa, also called the Race for Africa was a time in history when colonial expansion in Africa became rapid. It lasted from the 1880s until the beginning of World War I. Many European countries started colonies in Africa. The period is academically known as the age of New Imperialism. ==Background== The second half of the 19th century saw a change in the way countries controlled their colonies. In the old imperialism, Europeans had direct control over only small coastal areas. That had changed from economic control by settlement to political and military control of the colonies' resources. That was seen in the fight for areas that were controlled by European nations. ===Public opinion=== Many people became famous for helping European countries find more land in Africa. They included the explorers David Livingstone, Henry Morton Stanley, and Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza as well as the politician Jules Ferry. ===Berlin Conference=== The Berlin Conference (1884â€“85) tried to end disputes between the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other European countries. They agreed that \"effective occupation\" would be the rule for colonial claims. Laws had to be made for direct rule on a colony, backed up by military power. == Other reading == * Maria Petringa, Brazza, A Life for Africa (2006) Category:19th century in Africa Category:20th century in Africa Category:Colonialism",
