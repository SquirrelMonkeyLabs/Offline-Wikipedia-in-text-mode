Like all of China including both “China Proper” and the other outer east asian regions such as Tibet, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, it is also claimed by the current Chinese state known as the Republic of China. It is a large area with few people. It is over 1.6 million km2, which takes up about one sixth of the country's land. It is mainly inhabited by Uyghurs who are Turkic people. In the 19th century, when the name of the Silk Road was first used by a German geographer, it just included the land route from Xinjiang to Central Asia. Xinjiang sits at the heart of the Silk Road in China.Tourist map of Silk Road At that time, the country was often called \"Chinese Turkestan\" for its many Turkic peoples. Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and Jammu and Kashmir's Leh District to the south and Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the southeast, Mongolia to the east, Russia to the north and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan to the west, Pakistan and Kashmir region to the southwest.
