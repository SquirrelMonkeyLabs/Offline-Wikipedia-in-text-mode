Making Standards Work, p. 7. ==History== The story may have come from Aesop.Detlor, Theda. (2012). Teaching With Aesop's Fables, pp. 12-15. The earliest recorded versions are from the Middle Ages.Jamieson, John. (1808). An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language, p. 6; Perry, Ben Edwin. (1965). Babrius and Phaedrus, p. 487 n373. == Story == The story is about a group of mice who talk about what to do about a cat which threatens them. One wants to place a bell around the cat's neck. All agree. Then one mouse asks who will volunteer to put the bell on the cat? Not one stepped forward. The story is about the difference between a good idea and what may be needed to convert an idea into action. ==Idiom== The story gives us the idiom to bell the cat, which means to try an impossible or near- impossible task. In other words, it is easier said than done.Howard, Peter. (2004). Basic Reading Skills Years 3-4, p. 7. == References == Category:Fables Category:Idioms",
