It hangs in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. The Gallery writes, \"...[The Mill] speaks to us as a powerfully expressive work. Rembrandt evokes a feeling of the forces of nature in the dramatic confrontation of the iconic mill, so central to the Dutch way of life, against the sweep of the sky. At the same time, the figures within the landscape give it a human element that we can respond to on a personal basis.\"The Mill National Gallery of Art, Washington DC ==References== Category:Paintings in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC Category:Paintings by Rembrandt van Rijn Category:1640s paintings",
