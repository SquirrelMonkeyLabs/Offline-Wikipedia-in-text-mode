 "text": "A Mathematician's Apology is a book about mathematics which was written in 1940. == Overview == It was written by a British mathematician called G. H. Hardy (1877â€”1947). He used the essay to try to justify spending his life working on mathematics. It is said he wrote it for two reasons: #He was getting old and found it more difficult to work on mathematics. He spent time writing the essay instead because discovering new mathematical ideas was now too hard for him. #He believed that mathematics should be investigated for interest, instead of for making other things like weapons. == References == *G.
