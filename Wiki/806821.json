 "text": "In ecology, intraspecific competition is when two individuals of the same species compete for limited resources. Usually, the one winning the competition has a better fitness, and may better be able to reproduce. Examples for resources are food, water, space, light, or mates. This is different from interspecific competition vwhere members of different species compete. Intraspecific competition is important, because through evolution, species can become better adapted to where they live. Category:Biological competition",
