 "text": "Tavistock Square is a public town square in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden. ==History== The area was where one of the 7/7 attacks took place, when Hassib Hussain exploded a bomb on a bus near Woburn Place. The explosion would kill 13 people. This was the only bombing of the 4 bombings on that day that took place on a bus. The bus had went on a different route than usual because of the attacks earlier. ==Art== In the middle of the gardens is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi, made by Fredda Brilliant and put into the gardens in 1968. It is for people to leave flowers to remember him for his peaceful campaigning. A cherry tree was planted in 1967 to remember people who died to the nuclear bombings in Japan. The square contains a place to remember the doctor Dame Louisa Aldrich-Blake (1865 â€“1925), with a statue of Aldrich-Blake by Arthur George Walker planned out by Sir Edwin Lutyens. ==Images== Image:DSCN1999TavistockSqConcObj.jpg|stone remembering dead people, on the north area of the square.
