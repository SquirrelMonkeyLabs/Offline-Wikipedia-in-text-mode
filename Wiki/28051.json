 "text": "Lancashire is a ceremonial county in the North West of England. Its two cities are Lancaster and Preston. Before 1974, Liverpool and Manchester were part of the administrative county of Lancashire. ==Rivalry== The county has developed a fierce rivalry with Yorkshire, the next county east. This comes from rivalry in sport, such as in cricket, and comes from the War of the Roses. ==Places== A big attraction in Lancashire is Blackpool, an English seaside resort, which has a theme park called Blackpool Pleasure Beach. It has the second largest rollercoaster in Europe (\"The Big One\") and Blackpool Tower, a tower which was made to look like the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Lancashire has market towns (like Chorley) and small villages (like Bretherton, Croston and Eccleston). It is just south of an area of outstanding natural beauty called the Lake District. Lancashire also has a lot of pleasant countryside such as White Coppice and the Rivington Moors. ==Food== A famous food from Lancashire is \"Lancashire hotpot\" which is made of meat, onion or other vegetables and potatoes. It is often found on many pub menus in the county and in other places in Britain. ==People== The people of Lancashire are known for their friendly nature.
