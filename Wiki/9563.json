This was a full-size car. It was made between 1989 and 1999 after the company stopped the production of Peugeot 505. After this, the company made a smaller car named Peugeot 405, and a bigger car named Peugeot 605. The Peugeot 605 is a car of the luxury-family car class. === Peugeot 306 === The Peugeot 306 is the name of a car that started being made in 1993 and stopped being made in 2002. It was a small, family car. There were several verities of this car: from the slowest version, the 1.4, all the way up to the fastest version which was called the GTI-6. The Peugeot 306 also came in a diesel veriety, which many people see as an important step in bringing economical diesel oil powered car to people. This version came in 1.8 litre, 1.9 litre, and 1.9 litre turbocharged versions. In 1999, Peugeot replaced these diesel engines with the 2.0 litre HDI engine which was better at saving fuel than all the other engines. === Peugeot 3008 === The Peugeot 3008 was launched in 2008 as part of Peugeot's range . The design of this crossover aimed to combine the genres of an MPV and a hatchback. The 3008 comes with turbocharged 1.6-litre petrol engines, plus 1.6 and 2.0-litre diesels. Following the original 3008 model, Peugeot revealed the 3008 HYbrid4 later in the 2010 Paris Motor Show. It is the first diesel electric hybrid car. In 2012, the 3008 was facelifted. In May 2016, the 3008 received an all- new second generation. It now resembles a proper SUV rather than a MPV, and it comes with Peugeot's i-Cockpit from the 208. In September 2020, the second generation 3008 was facelifted with a new front end. === Current Vehicles === Model Calendar year introduced Current model Current model Vehicle description Introduction Update/facelift Hatchbacks 200x200px 208 208 2012 2019 2023 B-segment/subcompact hatchback, successor of the 207.
