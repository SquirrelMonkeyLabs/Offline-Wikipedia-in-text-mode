 "text": "Sacrifice (2014) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It was held on April 27, 2014 at the Impact Zone in Orlando, Florida. It was the ninth Sacrifice event that TNA held and was also the second event in TNA's 2014 pay-per-view schedule. There were eight matches on the card with three main events. The main events saw Eric Young defeat Magnus to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, Gunner defeat James Storm in \"I Quit\" match and Bobby Roode defeat Bully Ray in a Tables match. Sacrifice gained mixed reviews with James Caldwell, from Pro Wrestling Torch, saying \"there were probably three or four independent shows this weekend with more star-power in their main events\". Caldwell also gave the Bobby Roode-Bully Ray match minus two stars. ==Matches== # Results Stipulations Times 1 The Wolves (Eddie Edwards and Davey Richards) defeated The BroMans (Robbie E, Jessie Godderz and DJ Z) (c) 3-on-2 Handicap No Disqualification match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship 10:14 2 Mr. Anderson (with Christy Hemme) defeated Samuel Shaw Committed match 10:30 3 Kurt Angle and Willow defeated Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud Tag team match 9:04 4 Sanada (c) defeated Tigre Uno Singles match in match #3 of a best-of-three series for the TNA X Division Championship 9:29 5 Gunner defeated James Storm \"I Quit\" match 18:50 6 Angelina Love (with Velvet Sky) defeated Madison Rayne (c) Singles match for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship 8:08 7 Bobby Roode defeated Bully Ray Tables match 13:42 8 Eric Young (c) defeated Magnus Singles match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship 15:50 (c) â€“ refers to the champion(s) heading into the match ==References== ==Other websites== *Official TNA Sacrifice website Category:2014 in American television Category:2014 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in Orlando, Florida Category:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view events Category:2010s in Orlando, Florida Category:2014 in Florida",
