 "text": "The INS Dakar was a submarine of the Israeli Navy. It disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea in 1968. It had formerly belonged to the Royal Navy as the HMS Totem. After sea trials it departed Scotland in January 1968 for Israel. She never arrived and was lost at sea with her entire crew. In 1999 the wreckage was found between Cyprus and Crete. The cause of her sinking is still not known. In 1971 a memorial to the submarine was established in Gan HaNe'edarim in the National Military and Police cemetery at Mount Herzl, Jerusalem. The bridge portion of the vessel was salvaged and is on display at the Israeli Naval Museum in Haifa. == Related pages == * INS Dakar Memorial == References == == Other websites == * a memorial website for the INS Dakar Category:Submarines Category:Israel Defense Forces Category:Maritime disasters",
