 "text": "The history of genetic engineering started around 12,000 BC. At the time, humans tried to domesticate animals. The first artificial genetic engineering occurred in 1972. Two scientists named Herbert Norman Cohen transferred DNA then. In 1983, the first tobacco plant was created using genetic engineering. A gene that resisted antibiotics was introduced to the pl ant. ==Agriculture== Officially, genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of the genome with techniques developed in the 1970s. Without technology, genetic engineering has occurred in ancient times. It was through domestication and artificial selection that plants and animals were engineered. It is believed that the dog is the first domesticated animal, most likely from wolves. ==Research== Development of genetic engineering allows scientists to study diseases.
