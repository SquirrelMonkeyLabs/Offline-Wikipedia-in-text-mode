 "text": "A scarecrow is a figure usually made of sticks. It looks like a person. It is dressed in old clothes. A farmer puts a scarecrow in a field after he has planted seeds. He hopes the scarecrow will frighten birds away from the field. Some birds such as crows and sparrows eat the seeds the farmer plants. He does not want the birds to do this. If the birds eat the seeds, the farmer will not have a big crop of things to eat.Lesley Brown (ed.). (2007). \"Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles\". 6th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . ==Scarecrows in stories and literature== Scarecrows are sometimes characters in stories. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a story about a scarecrow who comes to life in \"Feathertop\". The most famous storybook scarecrow is probably the one in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. == References == == Other websites == *British history of the scarecrow *Photo of a crow trap in Australia *A typical English scarecrow made of discarded clothing Category:Agriculture",
