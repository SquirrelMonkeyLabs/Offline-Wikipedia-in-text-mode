 "text": "A police station is a building where police officers work. Other members of the law enforcement may work there as well. These buildings often contain offices and accommodation for staff. A small police station may have nothing apart from office space. Some police stations have cells for holding people who have been arrested. They may also have special rooms for interviewing people and rooms for storing evidence.",
