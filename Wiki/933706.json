 "text": "This is a list of Canadian One-day International cricketers. A One Day International, or an ODI, is an international cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. The list is arranged in the order in which each player won his first ODI cap. Where more than one player won his first ODI cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname. ==Key== General * – Captain * – Wicket-keeper * First – Year of debut * Last – Year of latest game * Mat – Number of matches played * Win% – Winning percentage Batting * Runs – Runs scored in career * HS – Highest score * Avg – Runs scored per dismissal * * – Batsman remained not out Bowling * Balls – Balls bowled in career * Wkt – Wickets taken in career * BBI – Best bowling in an innings * Ave – Average runs per wicket Fielding * Ca – Catches taken * St – Stumpings taken ==Players== :Statistics are correct as of the Canada's most recent ODI, against the Netherlands on 28 January 2014.
