 "text": "The WAGR P class were a total of 17 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (trading as Westrail) from 1989 to 2000. The P class were built by A. Goninan and Coy of Bassendean from 1989 to 1991. They entered service primarily on grain and general goods traffic, replacing 21 locomotives operating at the time. They became the primary motive power on the line of the old Midland Railway. All were included in the sale of Westrail to the Australian Railroad Group (ARG) in late 2000. All units remain in traffic mainly on agricultural goods trains around the Wheatbelt. == Gallery == Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives File:P 2509 P 2513, Katanning, 2007.jpg|link=|No. 2509 Shire of Three Springs (formerly 2009) and No. 2513 Shire of Morawa (formerly 2013) at Katanning in 2007.
