 "text": "Allobates caeruleodactylus is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Home== These frogs live in igapó forests that have streams in them. The frog only lives where the streams flood for part of the year so that they connect and make pools. Scientists have seen the frog in a few protected places: Floresta Nacional de Balata-Tufari, Floresta Nacional de Carajás, and Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentável Rio Amapa. ==Young== The male frogs sit on top of the dead leaves on the ground and call to the female frogs. The male frogs fight each other over good places to call to the female frogs. They do this in April and May. The tadpoles swim in pools of water that the streams make when they flood. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings do cut down trees to get wood to build with. People also build towns and dig into the ground for good rocks and metal. Scientists are not sure if people catch this frog to sell as a pet, but people have seen frogs in Colostethus that look like A. caeruleodactylus being sold as pets. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
