 "text": "A triangle choke, or sankaku-jime in judo, is a type of Choke hold that encircles the other person's neck and one arm using your legs. This resembles the shape of a triangle. When pressure is applied using the legs and the other persons shoulder, the blood flow from the carotid artery to the brain is constricted, resulting in a loss of consciousness. On average, it will take 9.5 seconds for the other person to lose consciousness when the choke is applied. This choke is also commonly used in jujutsu and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. == Technique == The triangle choke is usually applied from the guard position, where you are controlling the opponent with your legs. However, the choke can also be applied from different mounting positions. == References == Category:Martial art techniques",
