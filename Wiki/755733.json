 "text": "Lao script is the writing system used to write the Lao language. It is based on the Khmer script. Since the Thai script was also based on the Khmer script, Lao script is very similar. Like Thai, it is an abugida, it has tone markers, and it has three classes of consonants that decides the tone of syllables. However, it is different from the Thai script because it has fewer consonants and the characters are much curvier than Thai, which are more angular. It also does not have the extra letters from Sanskrit and Pali like Thai does. The Lao script has 27 consonant letters, 7 consonant ligatures, 33 vowel markers, and 4 tone markers. ==References== Category:Writing systems Category:Lao language",
