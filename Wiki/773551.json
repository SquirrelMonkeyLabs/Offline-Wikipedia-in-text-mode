Three singles were released from the EP: \"Find an Island\", \"Monsta\", and \"Supalonely\". The last became very popular in 2020 after many people shared the song on video-sharing app TikTok. Benee said she got the name for the EP from the sentence \"I am Stella and my car is called Steve\" (Benee's real first name is Stella). The cover shows Benee standing on top of a car with the licence plate \"STEVE\". ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart (2019â€“2020) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 19 Canadian Albums (Billboard) 91 French Albums (SNEP) 150 US Billboard 200 138 ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Australia/New Zealand 15 November 2019 Digital download, streaming Republic ==References== Category:2019 albums",
