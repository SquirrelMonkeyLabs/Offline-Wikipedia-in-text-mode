 "text": "Saikan (斎館, Saikan), which was previously known as Kezō-in, is a large temple lodging located on the top of Mount Haguro (Haguro-san), one of the Three Mountains of Dewa (Dewa Sanzan) in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan. There is a long passageway that climbs up the mountain and connects directly to the main temple of the complex. Visitors can enjoy elaborate Gohonbo Bassho-zen meals there. Traditionally, people would climb up 2,466 stone steps on the side of the mountain to reach the temple, but it is now accessible by car or bus as well. == Sources == == Other websites == Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Shinto shrines in Yamagata Prefecture",
