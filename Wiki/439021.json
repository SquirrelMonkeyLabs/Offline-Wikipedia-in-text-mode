 "text": "A fossil-fuel power station is a power station that makes electricity by burning certain fuels. Its machines change the heat energy that comes from burning the fuels into mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is then used to work an electrical generator. The generator makes the electricity. The fuels used in these kind of power stations are fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, which when burnt give off carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. Fossil-fuel power stations are the biggest cause of global warming. ==Types== * Coal-fired power station * Gas-fired power station Category:Power plants",
