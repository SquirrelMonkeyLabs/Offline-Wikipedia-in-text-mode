The mountain is in the south east corner of New South Wales, where it is part of the Great Dividing Range. The Indigenous Australians called the whole mountain Tar-gan-gil. The first European to visit the mountain was the Polish explorer, Count Paul Strzelecki in 1840. He named it Kosciuszko after the Polish patriot, Thaddeus Kosciuszko (1746 - 1817). Mount Kosciuszko is now part of the large Kosciuszko National Park. ==References== ==Other websites== * Kosciuszko National Park * Mt Kosciuszko Inc - Perth Kosciuszko Category:Geography of New South Wales",
