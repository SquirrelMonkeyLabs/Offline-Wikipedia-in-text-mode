 "text": "This is a list of current divided U.S. Routes. Some routes are given letters to show a split of the main route. For example, U.S. Route 25 (US 25) splits into US 25E (east) and US 25W (west) between Newport, Tennessee and North Corbin, Kentucky. These splits were in the U.S. Highway system from the beginning. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) no longer signs these letters. Current divided routes can be removed as agreements are reached. This was adopted in 1996. Many of these routes still exist, mostly in Tennessee. __TOC__ ==List of current routes== ==References== Category:U.S. Highways",
