 "text": "The story of Dhu al-Qarnayn (in Arabic: ذو القرنين, literally \"The Two-Horned One\"); is mentioned in Surah Al-Kahf, Ayahs 83–101 of the Qur'an. Dhu al- Qarnayn appears in the Qur'an as one established with power on earth by Allah, who reaches the setting and rising of the sun and sets up a barrier between a certain people and Gog and Magog. Elsewhere the Qur'an tells how the end of the world will be signaled by the release of Gog and Magog from behind the barrier. Dhu al-Qarnayn is identified by most Western and traditional Muslim scholars as a reference to the king of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon Alexander the Great. Ancient Ethiopic texts written by Jewish and Christian scribes have also referred to Alexander the Great as Dhu al- Qarnayn.https://books.google.com/books?id=fZ9NAAAAQBAJ&dq;=alexander+dhu+al- qarnayn&pg;=PA407 == References == Category:Quranic figures",
