 "text": "The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps is the venue of the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix and the Spa 24 Hours and 1000 km Spa endurance races. It is also home to the all Volkswagen club event, 25 Hours of Spa, run by the Uniroyal Fun Cup. It is one of the most challenging race tracks in the world. This is mainly because of its fast, hilly and twisty nature. Spa is a favourite circuit of many racing drivers and fans. The track was designed in 1920 by Jules de Their and Henri Langlois Van Ophem. The first car race was held at the circuit in 1922. 1924 was the first running of the now famous 24 Hours of Francorchamps race. The circuit was first used for Grand Prix racing in 1925. ==References== Category:Motor sports Category:Formula One circuits Category:Sport in Belgium Category:Wallonia Category:Li√®ge (province) Category:1922 establishments in Europe Category:1920s establishments in Belgium",
