They are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and the second largest in Pakistan. Their native language is Pashto, but many of them also speak Dari, Hindko and Urdu languages. They are the original or native people of the area south of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan and west of the Indus River in Pakistan. However, in the modern period, they have spread to cities outside their native land. According to researchers, the total population of the group is estimated to be around 90 million. ==Origins== Many Pashtuns believe that their ancestors were ancient Hebrews who arrived to what is now Afghanistan over 6000 years ago and settled there however this claim has no basis and the likely origins of the Pashtuns are that their ancestors were ancient Iranian farmers who settled down in the region from Central Asia. \"Pashtun.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. They were first mentioned by a Greek historian in 500 BC, then by Alexander the Great, and in the 3rd century they are called \"Abgans\" (\"Afghans\") by the Persian rulers. In the army of the Ghaznavids and Ghurid Sultanate thousands of Afghans were reported to be serving. They ruled Delhi Sultanate in the past and also Persia between 1725 to 1729 until they established the last Afghan empire that became what is now Afghanistan. There are also some Pashtuns who believe that they were Turkic, specifically Ghilzai Pashtuns, as DNA evidence shows and the thought that they descended from the Khalaj people, a Turkic ethnic group in Iran. ==Tribal code== The Pashtun people follow a strict code of honor, known as Pakhtunwali, that requires them to support the poor, the weak, and the challenged; to fight evil; to provide shelter to anyone who needs it and many more. Pashtun are also strict with obedience in their families and society. They are also known as the best at welcoming guests and taking good care of them. They really love to see respectful people in society, with great manners and obedience.National Geographic, Travel, Countries, Afghanistan Quiz http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/afghanistan-quiz/ ==Tribes== The three largest tribes of Pashtuns are the following: * Durrani * Ghilzai * Yusufzai ==Occupations== The Pashtuns are mostly farmers, herdsmen, and warriors but many of them are also businessmen and politicians.
