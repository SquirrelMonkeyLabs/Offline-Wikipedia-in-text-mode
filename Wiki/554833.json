 "text": "On April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr (August 16, 1989 â€“ April 19, 2015), a 25 year old African-American man from Baltimore, Maryland, was arrested by the Baltimore Police Department for having what police thought was an illegal switchblade. While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and had to be taken to a local trauma center as a result of the officers not securing him in the van. Gray later died resulting from injuries to his spinal cord. Six Baltimore police officers were suspended with pay. Gray's hospitalization and death resulted in protests and riots in downtown Baltimore starting on April 25. There were multiple arrests and 15 police officers were injured. On April 27, following Gray's funeral, civil disorder intensified with the looting and burning of local businesses, and a CVS Pharmacy. ==References== Category:2015 in Baltimore Category:April 2015 events Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Deaths by person in the United States",
