 "text": "Marcy Borders (July 19, 1973 - August 24, 2015) was an American legal assistant who worked for Bank of America. She is also known as \"The Dust Lady\". This is because of a picture taken of her by Stan Honda. The picture was of Borders completely covered in dust after surviving the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York City, as part of the September 11 attacks. At the time of the attacks, she was working on the 81st floor of the North Tower. After the attacks, her personal life and mental health declined. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She had problems with alcohol, broke up with her boyfriend, and lost custody of her children. She said that hearing the news of Osama Bin Laden's death made her start to turn her life around. In August 2014, she was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Her family and her blamed the toxic dust from the attacks as the reason why she got cancer. She died from the cancer on August 24, 2015. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:People from Bayonne, New Jersey Category:September 11 attacks",
