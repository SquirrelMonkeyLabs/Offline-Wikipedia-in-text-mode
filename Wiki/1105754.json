 "text": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series are American superhero television shows based on Marvel Comics characters. Marvel Television produced all the series released from 2013 to 2020. The shows were split into groups: the ABC series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, and Inhumans), the Netflix series (Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, and The Punisher), the young adult series (Runaways and Cloak & Dagger), and Adventure into Fear (Helstrom). While the shows were set in the MCU, the MCU movies rarely referenced the shows and the shows rarely referenced the movies, except for the early seasons of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Carter. From 2021 to now, Marvel Studios is the one to produce the shows. The shows are now part of the MCU phases, which were previously only movies. The Phase Four shows include WandaVision (2021), The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021), Loki season 1 (2021), What If...? season 1 (2021), Hawkeye (2021), Moon Knight (2022), Ms. Marvel (2022), and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022), while the Phase Five shows include Secret Invasion (2023), Loki season 2 (2023), What If...? season 2 (2023), Echo (2024), Agatha All Along (2024) and the upcoming shows Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (2024), Daredevil: Born Again (2025), and Ironheart (2025). Phase Six will consist of Eyes of Wakanda (2025), Marvel Zombies (2025), Wonder Man (2025) and Vision Quest (2026). Since Marvel Studios also produces the MCU movies, the shows and the movies are more connected now. == Marvel Television == === ABC series === Series Season Episodes Originally aired Showrunner(-s) First aired Last aired Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 1 22 September 24, 2013 May 13, 2014 Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell 2 22 September 23, 2014 May 12, 2015 3 22 September 29, 2015 May 17, 2016 4 22 September 20, 2016 May 16, 2017 5 22 December 1, 2017 May 18, 2018 6 13 May 10, 2019 August 2, 2019 7 13 May 27, 2020 August 12, 2020 Agent Carter 1 8 January 6, 2015 February 24, 2015 Tara Butters, Michele Fazekas, and Chris Dingess 2 10 January 19, 2016 March 1, 2016 Inhumans 1 8 September 29, 2017 November 10, 2017 Scott Buck === Netflix series === Series Season Episodes Originally aired Showrunner(-s) First aired Last aired Daredevil 1 13 April 10, 2015 Steven S.
