It is made of the Senate (upper chamber), and the House of Representatives (lower chamber). although in the Philippines the term congress commonly refers to just the latter. The Senate is made of 24 senators half of which are elected every three years. The House of Representatives is currently made of 297 congressmen. A regular session can last until thirty days before the opening of its next regular session in the succeeding year. The President may, however, call special sessions which are usually held between regular legislative sessions to handle emergencies or urgent matters. ==References== Category:Government of the Philippines Category:Bicameral legislatures",
