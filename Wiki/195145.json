 "text": "An articulated vehicle is a vehicle which has a pivot joint. This allows the vehicle to turn more sharply. There are many kinds of articulated vehicles: buses, trams and trains may be articulated. Steam locomotives were sometimes articulated so the driving wheels could pivot around turns. In fact, the whole idea of a train is an articulated set of vehicles which run along a track. Any vehicle towing a trailer could be described as articulated. The term (UK) of \"articulated lorry\" refers to the combination of a front part which pulls (the \"tractor\") and a rear part which follows (the \"trailor\"). In American English, these may be called semi-trailer trucks.. Category:Vehicles",
