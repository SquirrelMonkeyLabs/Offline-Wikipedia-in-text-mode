The company is headquartered in Norway. It has additional offices in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Poland. On January 30, 2015, it was told that Aspiro had received a $56 million takeover bid from Project Panther Bidco Ltd. That was indirectly owned and controlled by entertainment mogul Jay-Z. Even though some minority shareholders opposed the takeover and argued that Project Panther undervalued the growth potential in their bid, the acquisition was announced finalized on March 13. That was after being accepted by over 90% of the shareholders. ==References== Category:Jay-Z Category:Companies of Norway",
