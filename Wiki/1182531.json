 "text": "The United Transitional Cabinet of Belarus () is a government-in-exile for Belarus formed on August 9, 2022. ==Creation== Following the disputed 2020 Belarusian presidential election, opposition forces, led by presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya formed the Coordination Council to fight for a transition to democracy in the country. Tsikhanouskaya and other members of the council were forced to leave Belarus or were placed under arrest during the protests that broke out following the election. The United Transitional Cabinet was formed on August 9, 2022 during a two-day conference in Vilnius after members of the Belarusian opposition requested Tsikhanouskaya to form \"a united interim government\". ==Recognition== The European Parliament passed a resolution welcoming the formation of the United Transitional Cabinet on November 24, 2022, on top of the European Union's non-recognition of Lukashenko's so-called victory in the 2020 presidential election, which was neither free nor fair, and widely considered fake. ==Members== Membership of the Cabinet is for a term of six months. The former and current members of the transitional cabinet are as follows: Portfolio Name Photo Dates Head Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya 9 Aug 2022–present Deputy Head and Representative for the Transfer of Power Pavel Latushko 9 Aug 2022–present Deputy Head and Representative for Foreign Affairs Valery Kavaleuski 9 Aug 2022–26 June 2024 Vladzimir Astapenka (Deputy Representative for Foreign Affairs) September 2022–present Representative for Law and Order Aliaksandr Azarau 9 Aug 2022–6 Aug 2023 Representative for Defence and National Security Valery Sakhashchyk 9 Aug 2022–Aug 2024 Vadzim Kabanchuk 4 Aug 2024–present Representative for Finance and Economy Tatsiana ZaretskayaResigned. 9 Sep–2 Nov 2022 Representative for National Revival Alina Koushyk 16 Sep 2022–present Representative for Social Issues Volha Harbunova 26 December 2022–present Representative for Youth Policy Marharyta Vorychava 4 Aug 2024–present Notes: ==References== Category:Democracy movements Category:Politics of Belarus",
