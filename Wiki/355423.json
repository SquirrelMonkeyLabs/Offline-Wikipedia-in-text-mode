The E. macmahonii is also known as the \"McMahon's Viper\", the \"Asian Sand Viper\", the \"Leaf-nosed Viper\", and the \"Whiskered Viper\". == Description== The McMahon's Viper is a small species of snake, growing up to less than one meter. Males are smaller than females; males can grow up to the length of 22-40 cm, and females can grow up to the length of 28-72 cm.

Typically lives up to 15 years in the wild. == Behavior== The McMahon's Viper is said to be nocturnal, but some say it is crepuscular, meaning it is active during the early morning or late evening. It is able to sidewind on loose sand, and sometimes climbs into bushes. It is a aggressive snake, hissing very loudly when disturbed or annoyed, and sometimes it raising its head of the ground and starts striking aggressively.
