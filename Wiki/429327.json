It was released on August 29, 2005 in North America, September 23, 2005 in Europe, October 7, 2005 in Australasia. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 8.5 out of 10 saying \"The control mechanics, already solidly grapple-heavy and speedy, are made more intuitive still by a strategic synergy between stamina and submission systems, and complemented again by a fun momentum shift. The result is a wrestling game with less button mashing and more strategy.\" GameSpot gave the game a 8.1 out of 10 and stated \"Though some may be disappointed by the fact that it isn't a huge leap past what Day of Reckoning put forth, fans of the first game are certain to have a great time with the sequel.\" ==References== Category:2005 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo GameCube games Category:Nintendo GameCube-only games Category:Professional wrestling video games Category:THQ games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Day of Reckoning 2 Category:Yuke's games",
