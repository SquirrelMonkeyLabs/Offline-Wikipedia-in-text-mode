 "text": "\"Tilt Ya Head Back\" is a hip hop/pop song by American rapper Nelly featuring singer Christina Aguilera. Christina Aguilera's singing role was originally meant for Britney Spears. However, her record label Jive Records wouldn't allow her to because they thought the song was \"too urban\" even though Britney wanted to do the song anyways. The song is the second single from Nelly's third studio album Sweat. The song was released on September 15, 2004. The song reached number 4 on the New Zealand RIANZ Singles Chart, and 5 on both the UK Singles and Australian ARIA Charts Singles Charts.
