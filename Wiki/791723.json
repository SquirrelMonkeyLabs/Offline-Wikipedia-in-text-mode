 "text": "Hamdi Benani (; 1 January 1943 – 21 September 2020) was an Algerian singer and musician. ==Career== He was known for his 1963 song Ya Bahi El Djamel, which drove him to pursue a career in singing and violin. He brought new life to the Malouf genre of music with the tracks Mahbounati and Adala Ya Adala, which earned him great public success. This helped him be noticed by senior members of the Malouf singing community, such as Hassen El Annabi, Mohamed Tahar Fergani, and Abdelmoumène Bentobal. Benani was nicknamed \"l’ange blanc\" (The White Angel) because he was always seen in a white suit with his white violin. ==Personal life== Benani was born in Annaba. Benani died of COVID-19 in Annaba on 21 September 2020 at the age of 77. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1943 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Algerian singers Category:Violinists Category:Deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in Algeria",
