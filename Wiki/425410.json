 "text": "Fuzz bass (also called \"bass overdrive\" or \"bass distortion\") is a style of playing the electric bass. When a person plays fuzz bass, the bass sounds buzzy and distorted. Fuzz bass is created by turning up the volume on a bass amplifier very high, or by using an electronic fuzz pedal. In the mid-1960s, some bass players began to play fuzz bass. The Beatles' 1965 song \"Think for Yourself\" (from Rubber Soul) has fuzz bass. The 1965 Rolling Stones song \"Under My Thumb\" has fuzz bass. Category:Music technology Category:String instruments",
