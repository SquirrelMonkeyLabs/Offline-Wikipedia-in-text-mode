He worked in the Uganda Protectorate in 1912. He then moved to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan where he lived until 1925. When he was living there he wrote a book called The Lango: A Nilotic Tribe of Uganda. It was about the Lango people who lived in Uganda. The book was very important and he was called an anthropologist after he wrote it. He moved back to London, England and went to college at the London School of Economics. He then started working as a professor at the University of Cambridge. He also served in World War II.
