 "text": "Pectodens (meaning \"comb tooth\") is an extinct archosauromorph from Middle Triassic China.The type and only species of the genus is Pectodens zhenyuensis, named by Chun Li and colleagues in 2017. It may be a member of the Protorosauria; an unusual combination of traits similar (such as the long neck) and dissimilar (such as the absence of a hook on the fifth metatarsal bone) to other members causes Pectodens to elude exact classification.
