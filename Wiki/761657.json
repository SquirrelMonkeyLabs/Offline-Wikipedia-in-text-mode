 "text": "Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. Fake news is also known as prototype news, junk news, pseudo-news, alternative facts or hoax news. It is a form of news made up of misinformation, hoaxes or outright lies spread through large news media (print and broadcast) or online social media. In many cases, fake news is spread on purpose. The term was used and made popular by American President Donald Trump. Although false news has always been spread throughout history, the term \"fake news\" was first used in the 1890s when sensational reports in newspapers were common in the U.S.A.\"The real story of 'fake news': The term seems to have emerged around the end of the 19th century\". Merriam-Webster. Retrieved October 13, 2017. One reason fake news is more common today is that various websites pay for contributions according to the number of views. It stands to reason that a sensational claim will get more views than a correct but boring statement. Thus contributors are paid more for invented controversy than true non-sensational facts. This amounts to a premium payment for lies over truth. ==References== Category:Donald Trump Category:News Category:Disinformation",
