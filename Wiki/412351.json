 "text": "Amazing Alex was a puzzle game developed by Rovio Entertainment. It is one of the first Rovio games to not be in the Angry Birds series since the original Angry Birds game. == Reception == On Google Play, this game is rated as 4.3 out of 5 stars. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer a player of this game, prefers Angry Birds to Amazing Alex. He said, \"That's not to say that Amazing Alex isn't an addictive experience - it's just that compared to Angry Birds, there's less excitement involved. You rarely feel like throwing your arms in the air when you've completed a puzzle, for example, and the absence of any kind of antagonist reduces the stakes slightly.\" == Reference == Category:2012 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Puzzle video games",
