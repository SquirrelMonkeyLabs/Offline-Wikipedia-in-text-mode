 "text": "The Church of North India (CNI) is a major Protestant denomination in northern India. It is a united church established on 29 November 1970 by bringing together the main Protestant churches working in northern India; it is a province of the worldwide Anglican Communion. It is one of the three successors of the Church of England in South Asia, the others being the Church of Pakistan and the Church of South India. The merger resulted from discussions begun in 1929; it came eventually between the Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon (Anglican), the United Church of Northern India (Congregationalist and Presbyterian), the Baptist Churches of Northern India (British Baptists), the Church of the Brethren in India, which withdrew in 2006, the Methodist Church (British and Australian Conferences) and the Disciples of Christ denominations. The CNI's jurisdiction covers all states of the Republic of India with the exception of the four states in the south (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and has approximately 1,250,000 members (0.1% of India's population) in 3,000 pastorates.Reformed Online : \"Church of North India\" .
