Sharp talks about how important Nevison and the Men's League for Women's Suffrage is: \"It is impossible to rate too highly the sacrifices that they (Henry Nevinson and Laurence Housman) and H. N. Brailsford, F. W. Pethick Lawrence, Harold Laski, Israel Zangwill, Gerald Gould, George Lansbury, and many others made to keep our movement free from the suggestion of a sex war.\" Sharp's journalism made her more aware of working-class women's problems. She joined the Women's Industrial Council and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In the autumn of 1906 Sharp was sent by the Manchester Guardian to cover the first speech by Elizabeth Robins. After that speech, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union. == References == == Other websites == * * * * Biography at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography * * Category:1869 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Suffragettes Category:Journalists from London Category:English children's writers",
