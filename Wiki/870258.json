 "text": "Traditionalist theology (Arabic: الأثرية—al-Aṯharīya) is an Islamic scholarly movement, originating in the late 8th century CE, who reject rationalistic Islamic theology (kalam) in favor of strict textualism in interpreting the Quran and Hadith. The name derives from \"tradition\" in its technical sense as a translation of the Arabic word athar. It is also sometimes referred to by several other names. == History == Traditional theology spread in the late eighth century AD among muhaddiths, who regarded the Qur'an and pure hadith as the only acceptable source of law and religion.
