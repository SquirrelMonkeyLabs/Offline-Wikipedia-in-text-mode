 "text": "Paul Kagame (born October 23, 1957) is the President of Rwanda since 2000. Though a member of the Tutsi ethnic group, he tends to downplay the importance of his ethnicity. He is responsible for ending the Rwandan Genocide. However, he is often seen as a dictator, and has a bad human rights record. From 2018 to 2019, he was the Chairperson of the African Union. In 2022, he became the Commonwealth Chair-in-Office.
