For her contribution as a children's writer she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1966. Jansson is best known as the author of the Moomin books for children. The first such book, The Moomins and the Great Flood, appeared in 1945, though it was the next two books, Comet in Moominland and Finn Family Moomintroll, published in 1946 and 1948 respectively, that brought her fame. Jansson died in Helsinki, Finland from natural causes at the age of 86. ==Visual art== *\"Party in the city\", 1947; It is a mural; Helsinki Art Museum (HAM)https://www.moomin.com/en/blog/with-the-murals-tove-jansson-painted-she- brought-light-and-color-to-finland-that-was-recovering-from-the-wars-see-the- photos/#751cacd1.
