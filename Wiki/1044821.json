 "text": "Raorchestes primarrumpfi is a type of frog. It lives in India. It lives high in the Nilgiri Massif mountains. This frog lives in grasslands high up in the mountains, especially swampy parts of the grasslands. People have seen this frog between 2212 and 2359 meters above sea level. It can only live in grasslands with a large amount of water in the air. The female frog lays eggs on grass. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, it hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists say this frog is in a large danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place and human beings change that place in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. Scientists say the largest danger to this frog is climate change. Climate change could change the monsoon weather that makes the frog's home wet enough for the frog to live there. Human beings also change the grassland to farms for eucalyptus, sticks for building, and wood for building. Visitors to nearby national parks leave plastic garbage that can hurt the frog. People who moved nearby to live brought cats (and some of the cats ran away to live like wild animals) that can catch and kill the frog. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Raorchestes, so they think it could infect R. jayarami too. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Raorchestes tinniens but now they think that are two different species of frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
