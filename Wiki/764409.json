 "text": "A write-in candidate is a candidate in an election whose name does not appear on the ballot, but for whom voters may vote by writing in the person's name. Write-in candidates do not win very often. Sometimes write-in votes are cast for people who cannot hold office, or they are fictional characters. Some places require write-in candidates be registered as official candidates before the election.See, for example, Section 1-4-1101, Colorado Revised Statutes (2008) ==References== Category:Voting Category:Elections",
