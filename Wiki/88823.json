 "text": "Theta (uppercase Θ / lowercase θ), is a letter in the Greek alphabet. It represents the \"th\" sound (as in \"think\") in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 9. The Cyrillic letter Ѳ came from theta. In mathematics, the lowercase θ is used as a variable to represent an angle, and the uppercase Θ is used in big-theta notation (a variant of big-O notation). The lowercase θ is also used to represent the potential temperature in meteorology. == References == Category:Greek alphabet",
