 "text": "Liberal Christianity is a term which is used for several movements in Christianity. These movements formed between the 18th and 20th century. Their philosophical and theological ideas have been influenced by those of Enlightenment. They are not liberal in a political sense. They want to remain independent from dogmas defined by the different Christian Churches. When Liberal Christians interpret the Bible, they reject Biblical inerrancy and Papal authority. A Liberal Christian may have certain beliefs that are the same as those of more conservative Christians. Well known proponents include Hans Küng, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Albert Schweitzer. Conservative theologians and scholars strongly criticize Liberal Christianity’s rejection of orthodox doctrines and willingness to adapt to the modern era, claiming that it goes against traditional conceptions of Christian faith. Liberal Christianity has also been criticized for its pluralistic and relativistic leanings in theology. Modernism has been denounced by the Catholic Church as a heresy. ==Related pages== *Quaker *Episcopalian *Unitarian Universalism == References == Category:Christian movements and denominational families",
