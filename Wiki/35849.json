It is in the northeastern part of the island. It is next to Taipei County. Nicknamed the Rainy Port for its frequent rain and maritime role, the city is Taiwan's second largest seaport (after Kaohsiung). ==History== ===Early History=== Keelung was first inhabited by the Ketagalan, a tribe of Taiwanese aborigine. The Spanish expedition to Formosa in the early 17th century was its first contact with the West; by 1624 the Spanish had built San Salvador de Quelung, a fort in Keelung serving as an outpost of the Manila-based Spanish East Indies. The Spanish ruled it as a part of Spanish Formosa. From 1642 to 1661 and 1663–1668, Keelung was under Dutch control. The Dutch East India Company took over the Spanish Fort San Salvador at Santissima Trinidad. ==International relations== ===Twin towns – Sister cities=== Keelung is twinned with: * Bacolod and Davao City, Philippines * Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands * Campbell, California, U.S. * Corpus Christi, Texas, U.S. * East London, South Africa * Marrickville, New South Wales, Australia * Miyakojima, Okinawa, Japan * Rosemead, California, U.S. * Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S. * Sangju, North Gyeongsang, South Korea * Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada * Yakima, Washington, U.S. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * WorldStatesmen.org — Taiwan * Category:Cities in Taiwan Category:Ports and harbours of Taiwan",
