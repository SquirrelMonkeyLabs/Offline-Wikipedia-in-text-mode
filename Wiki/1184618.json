 "text": "On April 26, 2025, a vehicle-ramming attack happened during the Lapu Lapu Day festival in Vancouver, Canada. The festival celebrates Filipino heritage. Eleven people were killed and more than twenty were hurt. It is one of the deadliest vehicle attacks in Canadian history, tying with the 2018 Toronto van attack. The next day, it was reported by the Ministry of Health that number of injured had risen to 32 people. According to the Vancouver Police Department, the car attack was not an act of terrorism. A black Audi Q7 SUV drove through East 43rd Avenue west of Fraser Street at around 8:14 p.m. PDT. It hit multiple people and the driver, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, was held down by bystanders and arrested when he tried to run away from the scene. He was charged with eight counts of second-degree murder. == References == Category:Coordinates on Wikidata Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:April 2025 events Category:2025 crimes Category:2025 in Canada Category:Vancouver",
