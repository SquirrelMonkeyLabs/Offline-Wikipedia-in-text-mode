The iris of the eye is black in color. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives in forests that people have not changed too much. The frog lives near streams and other waters. People have seen this frog looking for food in dead leaves on the ground. People have seen this frog between 200 and 400 meters above sea level. This frog's young live in pools of water in Heliconia plants. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place.

At least one of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional del Serra do Divisor. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
