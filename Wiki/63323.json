 "text": "A drum stick or drumstick is a wooden stick that is used to hit percussion instruments to make sound. There are many kinds of drumsticks. Some sticks are made for certain instruments. For instance, a drum kit stick may look very different from a snare drum stick. Weight, length, and tip size are all altering factors in a stick. Some drums, such as bongo drums, use no drumstick.
