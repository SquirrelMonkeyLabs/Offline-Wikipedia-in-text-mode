 "text": "David Bennett Hill (August 29, 1843 - October 20, 1910) was the Democratic Governor of New York between 1885 and 1891. ==Life== Hill was born in Havana, New York on August 29, 1843 and was educated in New York's public schools. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1864. Hill was a member and speaker of the New York House of Representatives in 1871-1872, alderman of Elmira in 1880-1881, mayor of Elmira in 1882, and New York Lieutenant Governor in 1882-1885. When New York Governor Grover Cleveland resigned on January 6, 1885 in order to become U.S. President, Hill become New York's Governor. Hill later won elections for New York Governor in both November 1885 and November 1888. When Hill was New York Governor, child labor reform laws were supported, New York's economy was good, and the first person ever was executed using the electric chair. Also, as Governor, Hill vetoed a bill to have another census in New York in 1885 because this proposed census would ask too many questions and thus be too expensive for New York state taxpayers (who would have to pay for this census). Later on, Hill was U.S. Senator from New York between 1892 and 1897 and then retired from politics and went back to practicing law. Hill was also the president of the New York State Bar Association in 1885-1887. Hill died on October 20, 1910 and was buried in Mountour Cemetery in Montour Falls, New York. ==References== Category:1843 births Category:1910 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Governors of New York (state) Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians",
