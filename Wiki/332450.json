 "text": "Pentane is an organic compound with the chemical formula of . It is an alkane with five carbon atoms. Usually, \"pentane\" represents all three isomers (n-pentane, isopentane and neopentane). But in the IUPAC, pentane only represents n-pentane. In the IUPAC, the other two isomers is 2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane. Cyclopentane's chemical formula is , so it is not an isomer of pentane. ==Isomers== Common name normal pentane unbranched pentane n-pentane isopentane neopentane IUPAC name pentane 2-methylbutane 2,2-dimethylpropane Molecular diagram Skeletal diagram ==Reaction== All isomers of pentane burn with oxygen to make carbon dioxide and water: :+8->5+6. ==References== 5",
