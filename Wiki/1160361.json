 "text": "Linguistic anthropology is the study of how language affects social life. It is a part of anthropology that started with the effort to record languages that might disappear and has grown over the last hundred years to cover most parts of how language is built and used. Linguistic anthropology looks at how language shapes how people talk, creates social identity and belonging, helps organize big cultural ideas and beliefs, and builds a shared way of seeing the natural and social world. == References == Category:Anthropology",
