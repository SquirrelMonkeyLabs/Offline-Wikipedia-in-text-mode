 "text": "A type foundry is a company that makes different styles of letters and symbols for writing. In the past, people used to carve these letters, known as glyphs, into metal or wood by hand. But nowadays, they use computers to design and publish various fonts. These fonts can be used in books, websites, and other places where words are written. Creating a font involves carefully designing each letter, number, and symbol using special computer programs. Designers adjust things like size, shape, and spacing to make sure the letters look good together. Once a font is finished, it can be sold or licensed to people who need it for their projects. ==Related pages== * Typography * Type design * Typeface Category:Typography",
