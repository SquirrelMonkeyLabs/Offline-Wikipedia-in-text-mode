 "text": "The Hungarian National Socialist Party () was a Nazi party in Hungary. For the first time in history, this party united nearly all Nazi political initiatives in the country. ==History== The party was established on October 24, 1937, through the merger of seven far-right parties and groups. This event was publicly declared at an event held on the same day at the Buda Vigadó. Szálasi regarded this as a tremendous success and harbored grand plans: it appeared that the international situation – marked by the successes of Hitler’s Germany and the retreat of Western democracies – was also favorable to Hungarism. ==Resources== * Brief party history, vokscentrum.hu Category:Nazism Category:Racism Category:Defunct political parties in Hungary",
