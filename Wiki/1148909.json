 "text": "The inscriptions of Prithivishena II, the son and successor of Narendrasena, claim that Narendrasena's authority was recognized by the rulers of Kosala, Mekala, and Malava captured form local feudatories of Guptas or from Skandagupta. While many historians view this assertion as an exaggerated boast, it is possible that Narendrasena did significantly extend the Vakataka influence. During this period, the Gupta Empire, the dominant power in northern India, was preoccupied with defending against Huna invasions, which may have allowed the Vakatakas to expand their territory in central India. However, Malwa wasn't under Vakataka for long as it was recaptured by Skandagupta Furthermore, Narendrasenaâ€™s campaign against the Nalas could have played a key role in this expansion, particularly in the region around present-day Chhattisgarh. ==Related pages== *Kumaragupta's Deccan Campaign *Conquests of Harishena ==Notes== == References == Category:455",
