 "text": "Burial is the act of placing an object or dead body into the ground, specifically a grave. Human bodies are usually buried in a cemetery. It is common practice in many places to put bodies into a coffin and place the coffin into the grave. The grave is then usually marked with a headstone so that people know who has died and can visit them. In the past, often during times of war, many bodies have been placed into the same grave without coffins. This is called a mass burial or a mass grave. ==Related pages== * Death * Funeral * Cremation Category:Death customs",
