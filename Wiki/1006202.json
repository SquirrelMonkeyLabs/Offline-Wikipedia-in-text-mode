It is sometimes referred to as Tsuchimikado Shinto. Tensha Tsuchimikado Shinto was created by Abe no Seimei in the 900s and was influenced by Onmyodo. It has strong connections to the Abe clan. Yoshihito Fujita is the current leader of Tensha Tsuchimikado Shinto. In 1870, Tsuchimikado Shintō was abolished along with Onmyōdō due to a government ban. It was only permitted again in 1945, after the abolition of State Shinto and the establishment of religious freedom in Japan. In 1954, a new organization was formed for Tsuchimikado Shintō. == Related pages == * Confucian Shinto == References == Category:Confucian Shinto Category:13 Shinto Sects",
