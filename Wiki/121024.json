 "text": "Euplocephalus (meaning \"well-armored head\") was a large armored dinosaur, measuring about 20 feet (6 m) long; it weighed about 2 tons. Its wide head had a horny, toothless beak, small, peg-like cheek teeth, bony horns, and a small brain. Among its contemporaries were the large meat-eating Tyrannosaurus and Deinonychus. Fossils from more than 40 individuals have been discovered in Alberta, Canada and Montana in the United States, making Euoplocephalus the best known ankylosaurid.Arbour V.M.; Currie P.J. 2013. Euoplocephalus tutus and the diversity of Ankylosaurid dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada, and Montana, USA. PLOS ONE. 8 (5): e62421. This includes 15 skulls, teeth, and a few almost-complete skeletons, found with the armor still attached.Vickaryous M.K. et al. 2004. \"Ankylosauria\" In D.B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, and H.
