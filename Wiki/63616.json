 "text": "Shushanik Kurghinian (Popoljian) (1876-1927) was an Armenian poet. Kurghinian received little or no recognition for her outstanding poems. Although a socialist with some stirring poems of labour's rebellion to her name, she remained a dim star even in the Soviet era. Today she is almost unknown, away from the literary canon in Armenia and the Diaspora. == Background == Shushanik Kurghinian was born on August 18, 1876, in Alexandrapol, in the Yerevan province of Eastern Armenia, into a poor family of Popolji Harout. In her autobiography Shushanik writes of her childhood: “Sometimes father would bring his [shoe-repair] ‘workstation’ home, in order to save money, and I would work for him – demanding my wages, every single kopek (Coin). My mother, having been raised in a traditional household, would reprove my ‘ill behavior toward my parent,’and blamed those harmful books for corrupting me.” == Works == `Whoever is without hope, dulled, without spirit, alone and lacking faith... bring them to me my spirit is free I will give them of my soul...' (Selected Works, 1982 Yerevan p260) == Other websites == *`I Want to Live: Poems of Shushanik Kurghinian' or at ArmeniaPedia.org Category:Armenian poets Category:Autobiographers Category:1876 births Category:1927 deaths",
