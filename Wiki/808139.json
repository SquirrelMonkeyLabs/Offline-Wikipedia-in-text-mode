Previously known as the township of Michipicoten, after a nearby river of that name, the township was officially renamed in 2007 for its largest community of Wawa. This area was first made for fur trading. In the late 19th century, both gold and iron ore were found and mined, leading to the region's rise as the steel industry developed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. From 1900 to 1918 the Helen Mine had the highest production of iron ore of any mine in Canada. The township includes the smaller communities of Michipicoten and Michipicoten River, which are small port settlements on the shore of Lake Superior. These names are from the Ojibwe term for the river. == Demographics == Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006 census. * Population in 2021: 2,705 * Population in 2016: 2,905 * Population in 2011: 2,977 * Population in 2006: 3,204 * Population in 2001: 3,668 * Population in 1996: 4,145 * Population in 1991: 4,154 == Modern politics in Wawa == The municipal council is made up of one mayor and four councillors.
