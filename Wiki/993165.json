 "text": "Attendance Allowance is a Social Security benefit for disabled people in the United Kingdom. It was started in 1970. To get it people must show that they need help or have difficulty in connection with their bodily functions or need to be looked after all the time. Bodily functions are things that most people would do for themselves; they do not include things like cooking, housework or getting food. From 1992 people below pension age had to claim Disability Living Allowance instead. From April 2023 the amount is: * Higher rate: £101.75 per week for day and night care, or terminal illness. * Basic rate: £68.10 per week for day or night care. People who get Attendance Allowance may get increased means tested benefits. == References == Category:Social security in the United Kingdom Category:Disability Category:Old age",
