 "text": "Tiszaladány is a village in Tokaj District of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. Its population in 2024 was 575. == Location == Tiszaladány is located in the northeastern part of Hungary, in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County, in the Taktaköz region of the Great Plain, only 6 kilometers from Tokaj. Its borders connect three geographical regions; the northern part is low-lying, while the southern part, especially along the Tisza River, is hilly. Its current landscape was formed during the Pleistocene–Holocene period, with water and wind playing a major role in shaping it. The directly bordering settlements are: Tokaj to the north, Tiszaeszlár to the east, Tiszalök to the south (the latter two are located on the other bank of the Tisza), Tiszatardos to the southwest, Csobaj to the west, and Tarcal to the northwest. == History == The name Tiszaladány was first mentioned in a document from 1446 in the Kállay family archives. The settlement was once part of the Rákóczi estate, then later belonged to the Treasury. In the early 20th century, it was recorded as part of Baroness Róza Győrffy's estate. At the beginning of the 1900s, it had 1,142 residents, all of whom were Reformed. At that time, there were 120 houses. == Population == In 2022, 93.2% of the population identified as Hungarian, 16.2% as Roma, 0.7% as German, 0.2% as Rusyn, 0.2% as Polish, and 1.6% as belonging to other non- domestic nationalities (6.3% did not declare; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%). In terms of religion, 6.5% were Roman Catholic, 51.8% Reformed, 1.9% Greek Catholic, 0.2% other Christian, 0.3% Lutheran, and 13.1% non-denominational (25.1% did not respond). == Notes == == Other websites == * Tiszaladány Municipality website Category:Settlements in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Category:Villages in Hungary",
