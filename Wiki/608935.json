(also called 4000 Parvat State) continued for 300 years only to be defeated by Dimba Bam Malla to form bigger Parbat State. Yashodhara Thapa, King of Jyamrukot (Jamarik), is the male progenitor of the Bhimsen Thapa family and leading Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. ==Fictitious Account== In the Thapa genealogy, he is also accredited to have ruled over Doti from Kāndāmalika. The genealogy claims that he was son of fictitious Kshatriya named Vatsaraja () born from Ashwamedha Yagya (holy fire) and fictitious Vasundhara Devi, daughter of fictitious Kanyakubji Rajput chief Radha Madhav Rajput. The genealogy claims Vatsaraja to be giant sized and thus achieving title of Abhaya Narsingh Maharaja and his son Kalu Thapa achieving title of Abhaya Narsingh Kumar. The genealogy traces the lineage of all Bagale Thapas to a male progenitor (Mūlapuruṣa) King Kalu Thapa Kshatri, who first ascended to the throne at Kāndāmālikā on Saka Era 1111. ==Children== He had four sons who descended the four divisions of his state; * Purnakhar Thapa (Punyakar) - succeeded Pulachour Kingdom * Tarapati Thapa (Tarasimha) - succeeded Takam Kingdom * Biru Thapa - succeeded Rukumkot Kingdom * Dharmaraj Thapa (Yashodhar/Jashodhar) - succeeded Jyamrukot (Jamarik) Kingdom Later, all these states were conquered by Samalvanshi Thakuri King Dimba Bam Malla. ==References== Category:History of Nepal",
