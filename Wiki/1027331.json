 "text": "A shopping bag is a bag that is used to carry items that were purchased during shopping, for example in a grocery store or supermarket. There are different designs for such bags: *Many are single-use. When people reach their home, they throw away the bag. *Some can be used again. These bags can be made of paper, of different kinds of plastics or of a natural fiber, such as jute or hemp. Because plastic bags take a long time to decay, some countries have banned single-use plastic bags. Category:Everyday life",
