According to the Tibet Information Network, unnamed sources say that the government banned the book about September 2003. According to UNPO, Woeser lost her job shortly after the ban. Radio Free Asia said that she continued to write poems and articles on her two blogs: Maroon Map (绛红色的地图, oser.tibetcul.net), which, according to the author, was visited mostly by Tibetans, and the Woeser blog (blog.daqi.com/weise), which was visited mostly by those of Han ethnicity. According to RFA, on July 28, 2006, both blogs were closed by the government. The blogs were probably closed because she wrote birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama and wrote about other sensitive topics. Woeser said that she would continue to write and to speak.
