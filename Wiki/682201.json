 "text": "The NXT UK Women's Championship was a professional wrestling title owned by WWE and competed for by the women of NXT UK. It was created on June 18, 2018 during the first night of the 2018 United Kingdom Championship Tournament. There was an announcement during the tournament that an 8-woman tournament would happen on the first episodes of NXT UK and it would decide the first NXT UK Women's Championship. Rhea Ripley beat Toni Storm in the final to become the first champion. In August 2022, WWE announced that the NXT UK brand would end and restart as NXT Europe at a later time. So the NXT UK Women's Championship was retired on 4 September 2022 at Worlds Collide. At the event, Mandy Rose defeated Blair Davenport and reigning NXT UK Women's Champion Meiko Satomura in a triple threat match to make the NXT UK Women's Championship into one with Rose's NXT Women's Championship. Satomura is listed as the final NXT UK Women's Champion. Rose went on as the unified NXT Women's Champion. == Tournament == == Reigns == == Notes == ==References== == Other websites == * NXT UK Women's Title History Category:World Wrestling Entertainment championships",
