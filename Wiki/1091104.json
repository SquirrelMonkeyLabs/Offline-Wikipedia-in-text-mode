 "text": "The bana bubble-nest frog or bana frilled tree frog (Kurixalus banaensis) is a frog. It lives in Laos and Vietnam. People have seen it between 109 and 1510 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have mostly evergreen trees. People have not seen them anywhere that is not a forest. Scientists think this frog's tadpoles swim in water that does not move. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Bach Ma National Park, Song Thanh Nature Reserve, and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
