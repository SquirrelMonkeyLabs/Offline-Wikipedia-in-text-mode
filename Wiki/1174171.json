 "text": "Pányok (Slovak: Paňovce) is a village in Gönc District of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County. Its population in 2024 was 84. == Location == It lies near the Hernád River, at the western foothills of the Zemplén Mountains, 74 kilometers northeast of Miskolc, the county seat. The neighboring settlements are Kéked to the north, Telkibánya to the south, and Abaújvár to the west. The nearest town is Gönc (16 km away). == History == Pányok is an old settlement from the 1200s. Its name was first mentioned in documents in 1263 as Panc. Later, it appeared as Pank in 1266, Panky in 1270, Panch in 1276, and Paynk in 1298. In 1266, settlers from Abaújvár asked for Pányok, but since it was the inherited land of the Pányoki family, they didn’t get it. In 1325, when the family divided their lands, Pányok stayed a shared property. During the Turkish occupation, it became empty, and by 1715, it was a wasteland. It was repopulated by the end of the 18th century. According to the 1910 census, out of 420 residents, 417 were Hungarian. Of these, 69 were Roman Catholic, 321 were Reformed, and 18 were Jewish. == Population == In 2022, 39.7% of the population identified as Hungarian and 15.9% as Slovak (52.4% did not respond; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%). Regarding religion, 9.5% were Roman Catholic, 14.3% Reformed, 1.6% Greek Catholic, 4.8% Lutheran, and 3.2% non-religious (66.7% did not answer).Pányok ==References== Category:Villages in Hungary Category:Settlements in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Category:Gönc District",
