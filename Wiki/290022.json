He began playing for the Indianapolis Capitals of the AHL for the 1948–49 season. The Detroit Red Wings promoted him in 1951, and his defensive play would help them secure the Stanley Cup in 1952, 54, and 55. Woit was traded to Chicago Black Hawks following the 1954–55 season but never produced as he did with the Red Wings.
