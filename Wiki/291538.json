 "text": "The Gerhard Hanappi stadium was a football stadium in Vienna, Austria. It was the homeground of SK Rapid Wien and is named after Gerhard Hanappi, the architect of the stadium and former player of Rapid Wien. ==History== The work started in 1971 but there was a delay in finishing it. The plan was not fully built because it should be cheaper. The new stadium was named \"Weststadion\" (western stadium) because it lays in the western part of Vienna. It was planned that the two major clubs should play in this new stadium, but Austria Wien was not amused that her rival has got a stadium in its own district, so they went back to their former homeground, the Franz Horr stadium. But till 1992 they often came back because the Horr stadium was not licensed for international matches. In April 1981 it got the name of its architect Gerhard Hanappi, who was player for Rapid Wien. The first match which was played here was a leaguematch SK Rapid versus Austria Vienna. But the official opening was on September 14th, 1977 with a UEFA-Cup match Rapid versus FK Inter Bratislava (1:0). It was not love at first sight between the fans and the new stadium, but meanwhile they accept it. It is even called \"Saint Hanappi\" following the slogan of the fans \"Rapid is our religion.\" The stadium was demolished in 2014 to build the Allianz Stadion, which was opened on 16 July 2016. During its construction, Rapid Vienna played their home games at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion in the Prater. ==Special matches in the Gerhard-Hanappi-stadium== === ÖFB-Cup finals=== * 1977: FK Austria Wien – Wiener Sport-Club 3:0 (2:0) * 1983: SK Rapid Wien – Wacker Innsbruck 3:0 (1:0) * 1984: SK Rapid Wien – FK Austria Wien 2:0 (2:0) * 1985: SK Rapid Wien – FK Austria Wien 3:3 (1:1) (0:0) n.
