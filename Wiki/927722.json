 "text": "Bally's Chicago is an approved casino resort that will be built in Chicago, Illinois, the United States. In May 2022, Mayor Lori Lightfoot approved Bally's Corporation's bid to build a casino area in the city. It will be located in the city's River West neighborhood near the Chicago River. In April 2021, Lightfoot announced that the \"casino-resort\" would have a 500-room hotel, meeting space, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. The goal for this casino was to create a $200 million in annual tax revenue from the casino to fund police and firefighter pension funds. A casino run by Rush Street Gaming with a location at the South Loop and Chinatown along the Chicago River and a proposal from Hard Rock to build the casino near Soldier Field were also discussed. The James R. Thompson Center was also seen as a possible casino location. On May 5, 2022, Lightfoot announced that she had selected the bid from the Bally's Corporation. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Chicago Category:Casinos",
