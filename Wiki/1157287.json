OCLC 426069353. == Background == Krajë was a border area between Montenegro and Albania, with the village of Cermnicë in the middle. In the 1700s, the tribes of Cermnica and Limnjan, with help from Cetinje, fought against Albanians in Krajë. The border between the Ottoman Empire and Montenegro was officially decided in 1859, running through Lake Skadar and nearby mountains. After Prince Nikola I replaced Danilo I in 1860, Montenegro strengthened its defenses and expanded into Albanian lands. For 400 years, Krajë had been an important region for the Malësors in terms of history, culture, and economy.\"Të dhëna të ndryshme mbi popullsinë\". Koha Javore. 2018-02-16.

The Montenegrins aimed to kill as many Albanians as possible and loot their belongings. The Albanians, with help from their women, fiercely defended their homes, and many houses became strong fortresses. The Montenegrins were defeated, and Pope Savo Vujović was killed, just as he had predicted. News of the battle spread, and people from Shkodra came to help. Reinforcements were sent to the Montenegrins, but the fighting stopped, and they retreated to Krricë and Cermicë. The people of Šestani did not fight the Montenegrins during or after the attack on Muriq, but they killed eight Montenegrins from Orahova who had stayed behind in Lower Šestani.\"Lufta e Muriqit\".
