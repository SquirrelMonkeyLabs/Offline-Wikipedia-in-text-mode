 "text": "Ohi Day (or Oxi Day) is a day that people in Greece celebrate on 28 October (the actual date of it being 28 October 1940). This is an event where people in Greece fought the Italians (the axis forces) during World War II over Greek land. On this day, an Italian messenger had come up to Ioannis Metaxas and proclaimed to him that if he did not give the Italians their land, there would be trouble. Metaxas, still in his pyjamas, formerly replied in French, \"There will be war.\" Men from all around Greece happily marched off to war, and eventually won the battle, the Italians having underestimated them. And that is Oxi Day. Category:Greek culture",
