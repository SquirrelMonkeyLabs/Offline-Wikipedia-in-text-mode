 "text": "Zhangixalus lishuiensis is a frog. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Fengyang Forest Station. This is in Zhejiang Province, China. People have seen it between 700 and 1100 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in forests on mountains. These forests have both trees with needles and trees with leaves. The male frogs dig holes near the roots of Jiaobai plants. These holes have openings that are underwater so the frogs must swim to get into them. The female frogs go into these holes to lay eggs. But sometimes they lay eggs on the stems of the Jiaobai plants or on the water. Scientists do not know much about this frog, but they think the number of frogs in the world stays the same year after year. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
