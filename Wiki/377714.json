After DNA testing confirmed his identity, the remains were removed from the tomb and returned to Blassie's family, but the Medal of Honor remained as a tribute to those veterans still unknown. The Blassie family requested that the Medal of Honor be granted to him but the request was denied by the Department of Defense. ==References== : * Vietnam War Category:Vietnam War",
