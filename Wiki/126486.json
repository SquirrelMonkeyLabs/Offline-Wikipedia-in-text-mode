 "text": "A stable is a building for livestock animals such as horses or cows to live in. A stable often has a loft where food such as hay can be kept to feed the animals in the winter. The stable may be divided into enclosures or stalls to keep the animals separate. A stable is most likely to be built near a farmhouse. According to the Christian Bible, the baby Jesus was born in a stable. He was wrapped up and put to sleep on the straw in a manger. Category:Agriculture Category:Animal enclosures",
