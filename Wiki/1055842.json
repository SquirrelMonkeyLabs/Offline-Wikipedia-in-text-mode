 "text": "The Blockade of the Gaza Strip (2023) was the blockade of Gaza, which involved the operations carried out during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war by Israel in order to restrict supplies such as food, water, and medicine. Fuel and electricity were also restricted by Israel. The Israeli Energy Minister, Israel Katz stated that the lifting and end of the blockade would not occur until hostages, who were captured by Hamas, are released and are safely returned to their country. The blockade of Gaza was undertaken by Israel, in response to the Hamas offensive against Israel. The blockade began in the Gaza Strip on 9 October 2023. Even though the blockade was lifted after couple of weeks, it resulted in a serious humanitarian crisis. == Related pages == * Gaza genocide * Gaza humanitarian crisis (2023–present) * Blockade of the Gaza Strip == References == Category:2023 in Asia Category:2024 in Asia Category:Gaza genocide Category:History of the Gaza Strip",
