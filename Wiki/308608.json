 "text": "Tangier, also Tangiers (Tifinagh: ⵜⴰⵏⵊⴰ Tanja, archaic Berber name: Tingi, Arabic: طنجة Ṭanja) is a city in northern Morocco with a population of about 700,000 (2008 census). It lies on the North African coast at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Spartel. It is the capital of the Tangier-Tetouan Region and of the Tangier-Asilah prefecture of Morocco near the Spanish border. The history of Tangier is very rich due to the historical presence of many civilizations and cultures starting from the 5th century BC. Between the period of being a Phoenician town to the independence era around the 1950s, Tangier was a place—and, sometimes a refuge—for many cultures. However, it was not until 1923 that Tangier was attributed an international status by foreign colonial powers, thus becoming a destination for many Europeans, Americans and Indians alike. The city is currently undergoing rapid development and modernization. Projects include new 5-star hotels along the bay, a modern business district called Tangier City Centre, a new airport terminal and a new soccer stadium. Tangier's economy is also set to benefit greatly from the new Tanger-Med port. == Other websites == *Official site of The Tangier American Legation Institute for Moroccan Studies *Travel article with photos *Tangier photo gallery * Navigating Tangier’s Labyrinth – slideshow by The New York Times Category:1945 establishments Category:Establishments in Morocco Category:1940s establishments in Africa Category:Phoenician colonies Category:Cities in Morocco",
