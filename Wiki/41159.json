The last time he was measured was on January 15 of 2005. On August 7, 2007 Leonid Stadnyk was measuring and was found to be taller than him. In September 2005 he made his first trip outside of China to London to visit Guinness World Records. Xi Shun served in the People's Republic of China army but got discharged because of rheumatism. He once saved some dolphins' lives by getting pieces of plastic from their stomachs that veterinarians could not reach. Radhouane Charbib was the tallest man by Guinness world records until Bao Xishun beat his record on 15 January 2005. That is where he was measured 2 millimetres taller in the Chifeng Hospital in China. Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:People from Inner Mongolia Category:World record holders",
