 "text": "The Silvia Night Show is a 2007 Icelandic television series following the controversial fictional character Silvia Night. It is the English version that was made to promote her participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. The show followed Silvia Night during her appearance in Eurovision Song Contest 2006, and her tantrums after she realised she did not qualify for the final. Silvia also received a lot of attention from media when she, on the premiere day of her own television program, protested against it on the streets of Reykjavík saying that \"the show is total junk\". The show will be available on DVD sometime soon. The Silvia Night Show started airing in Sweden on the channel TV400 on October 10, 2007. == Other websites == * *The Silvia Night Show (episodes online) - at Skjárinn * Category:2007 television series debuts",
