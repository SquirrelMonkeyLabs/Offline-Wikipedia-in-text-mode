 "text": "Fish sauce is an Asian cooking ingredient. It is made from fish or krill which has been coated in salt and then fermented for up to two years. It is used as a seasoning in quite a lot of Asian dishes, particularly those from Burma, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Fish sauce is used by chefs to add the umami flavor to dishes. Soy sauce is sometimes considered a vegetarian alternative to fish sauce. In French and international cuisine the corresponding term is fish stock. That is made differently and tastes different. ==References== Category:Condiments Category:Sauces Category:Fish dishes Category:Cambodian food Category:Chinese food Category:Korean food Category:Laotian food Category:Filipino food Category:Thai food [[Category:Vietnamese food]",
