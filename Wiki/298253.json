On March 10, 2014, during a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets, he collapsed on the team bench. He has had heart conditions in the past and missed a few games the week earlier when he didn't feel well after a game. He is in stable condition. The NHL released a state on Peverley's health saying: \"Dallas player Rich Peverley is doing well and is in stable condition. He was transported to the hospital.\" As a result of the emotional state of the players on both teams caused by the medical emergency, the game was rescheduled to April 9. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Atlanta Thrashers players Category:Boston Bruins players Category:Canadian ice hockey centres Category:Dallas Stars players Category:Milwaukee Admirals players Category:Nashville Predators players Category:Sportspeople from Kingston, Ontario Category:Portland Pirates players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Ice hockey people from Guelph Category:ECHL players",
