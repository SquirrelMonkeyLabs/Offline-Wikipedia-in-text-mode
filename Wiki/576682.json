After learning to climb at Tahquitz he went on to make first ascents of many big wall routes in Yosemite. As an early proponent of boltless, pitonless clean climbing, he, along with Yvon Chouinard, was instrumental in changing the climbing culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s by encouraging the use and preservation of the natural features of the rock. He went on to become a well-known kayaker. Robbins died on March 14, 2017 in Modesto, California from a long-illness, aged 82. ==References== ==Other websites== *Royal Robbins website apparel company site Category:1935 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Businesspeople from California Category:Businesspeople from West Virginia Category:Writers from West Virginia Category:Sportspeople from West Virginia Category:Sportspeople from California Category:Writers from California Category:People from Modesto, California Category:American mountain climbers Category:Kayakers",
