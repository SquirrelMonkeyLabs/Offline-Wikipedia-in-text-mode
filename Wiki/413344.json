He was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck where he was in critical but stable condition. According to his doctor, even though he was trapped for a relatively short time and hopes had originally been higher, subsequent neurological tests showed that after fifty minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in moderate hypothermia he suffered massive brain damage due to oxygen shortage. The prince was in a minimally conscious state and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness. After nearly a year and a half in a coma, he died on 12 August 2013. ==References== ==Other websites== * Geen Toestemmingswet Huwelijk Friso en Mabel, archived from regering.nl, 10 October 2003 (Dutch) Category:1968 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Skiing deaths Category:Dutch businesspeople Category:Dutch princes and princesses",
