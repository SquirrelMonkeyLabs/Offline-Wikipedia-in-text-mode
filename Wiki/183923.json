It started in 1950. It operates the largest network in the Middle East. The airline's current announced network stretches from Europe to Asia, connecting 58 places, with a fleet of 34 aircraft. == History == 1949 - 1973: Gulf Aviation as operating company In the late 1940s, Freddie Bosworth, a British pilot and entrepreneur, began an air taxi service to Doha and Dhahran from Bahrain. Bosworth later expanded the service and, on 24 March 1950, registered Gulf Aviation Company Limited as a private shareholding company. This makes Gulf Air, one of the oldest carriers in the Middle East. The early fleet contained seven Avro Ansons and three de Havilland DH 86B four-engine biplanes. In October 1951, British Overseas Airways Corporation became a major shareholder in Gulf Aviation, holding a 22% stake through their subsidiary company BOAC Associated Companies. 1970s: Multinational Ownership In 1973 the governments of the Emirate (now Kingdom) of Bahrain, the State of Qatar, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the Sultanate of Oman agreed to purchase the BOAC Associated Companies holding in Gulf Aviation. The Foundation Treaty was signed on 1 January 1974 and gave each government a 25% shareholding in Gulf Aviation, which became a holding company. Gulf Air became the flag carrier for the four states. With leased Lockheed L-1011 Tristar and Boeing 737 Aircraft joining the fleet, by 1976 Gulf Air had expanded its route network to include Amman, Amsterdam, Athens, Baghdad, Bombay, Bangkok, Beirut, Cairo, Colombo, Delhi, Dhaka, Hong Kong, Jeddah, Karachi, Khartoum, Larnaca, Manila, Paris, Ras Al-Khaimah and Sana'a. The fleet comprised four Vickers VC10, three BAC One-Elevens, two Lockheed L-1011 Tristar 200s, and five Boeing 737-200s. In 1978, the airline doubled the Tristar fleet to replace the VC10s. Meanwhile, the airline increased the Boeing 737 fleet to nine and phased out the One-Elevens. 1980s - 1992: Expansion The 1980s saw an increase in air travel and growth for Gulf Air. in 1981, Gulf Air became an IATA member, and in the following year became the first international airline to land in Riyadh. In 1985, Emirates, the startup national carrier of Dubai, began operating. In 1988, Boeing 767s joined the fleet and the airline launched services to Frankfurt, Istanbul, Damascus, Dar Es Salam, Fujairah, and Nairobi, and resumed their services to Shiraz and Baghdad. The original Gulf Air livery consisted of a white fuselage with three stripes: Maroon, brown, green and red with a golden falcon on the three-striped tail fin. This livery was used in the following Gulf Air airlines: Lockheed L1011-200 Tristar (1976), Boeing 737-200 (1977), Boeing 767-300ER (1988), Airbus A320-200 (1992), Airbus A340-300 (1994), and Airbus A330-200 (1999). Gulf Air celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1990. The light-blue and peach Balenciaga- designed uniform was introduced.

The airline ran a series of advertisements in local newspapers, thanking Abu Dhabi for its contribution to Gulf Air. As the National Carrier for the United Arab Emirates for over 35 years, it had a large customer base located in Abu Dhabi. Gulf Air endeavored to show continuing support for flights to Abu Dhabi from Bahrain and Muscat, connecting to the rest of the Gulf Air network, via advertisements placed in local newspapers.
