 "text": "Vanzolini's leaf frog (Phrynomedusa vanzolinii) is a frog that lives in southeastern Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in two places: Estação Biológica de Boracéia and Teresópolis. People have seen it between 800 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests where the tree branches come together like a roof. People have seen its tadpoles swimming in pools near streams. Scientists say all the frogs in this species might be dead now. If any are alive, it is probably very few. Scientists have not seen this frog since the 1980s. They do not know for sure why it died, but it happened about the same time that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis came to the place where it lives. Scientists say that if anyone sees this frog again, people should make a program to take them out of the forest and breed them in human- controlled places. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
