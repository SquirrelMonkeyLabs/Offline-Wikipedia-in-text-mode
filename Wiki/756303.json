Ortmann is a three-time world champion, winning the 1995 WPA World Nine-ball Championship and both the 2007 and 2010 Straight pool world championships. With 14 wins, he is one of the best players at the European Pool Championships. Ortmann is the second to Ralf Souquet on the Euro Tour, winning 14 events. Ortmann was the first player from Europe to win the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship, in 1989. He has been on Europe's team 8 times in the Mosconi Cup from 1994 to 2004. He was on the winning side in 1995 and 2002. With 44 German national medals, Ortmann is one of the best German pool players ever. In 1996, he was the first cue sports player to receive the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, the highest sporting award given in Germany. Ortmann was put into the Straight Pool Hall of Fame in an August 2013 ceremony in New York City. The following year, he was entered into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame. ==Career== ===Early career=== Ortmann was born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. At age six he began playing on a pool table in his parents' restaurant. Ortmann won his first event in 1985 at age 17 (the 8-Ball Junior European championships), defeating Sweden's Per Anda in the final. The following year he won his first German national championship (the straight pool championship), after meeting Thomas Engert in the final. Ortmann studied in Munich to become an electronics technician, and at age 20 he became the manager of a billiard centre with 80 pool and billiard tables. He was the first player from Europe to win the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship in 1989. He won the event despite it being his first trip outside of Europe. As an unknown player, Ortmann defeated Steve Mizerak in the final. Ortmann also won his first of many adult European Pool Championship events that year, beating Waldemar Markert in the straight-pool final. ===Professional career (1993–2010)=== He entered his first Euro Tour event in 1993 and finished second at that year's German Open. He also won the following events in Austria and Hungary. Ortmann won his second US championship later that year, again in straight pool. He won five Euro Tour events the following year, and finished second twice. During the nine-event season he went to the finals seven times. He won his first world championship (the 1995 WPA World Nine-ball Championship), playing Dallas West in the final. In 1996, Ortmann was the first cue-sports player to receive the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt. Ortmann won the winner-take-all International Challenge of Champions event in 1997. He was second place two years later, losing the final to Francisco Bustamante. In 2000, however, Ortmann beat Bustamante in the final for his second championship. In 2004, Ortmann made a business called Ortmann Billiards, which makes pool products. Ortmann Billiards also makes air hockey, darts and poker supplies. Ortmann reached the final of the 2004 World Pool Masters, but was defeated 6–8 by Thomas Engert. Two years later, he joined the International Pool Tour and continued competing in events sanctioned by other organizations. Ortmann won the 2007 World Pool-Billiard Association World Straight Pool Championship, defeating Danny Barouty 200–56, Dennis Orcollo 200–7, and Danny Harriman 200–123 to reach the final. There, he defeated Huidji See 200–171 for his second world championship. Ortmann made the tournament's third-highest , a 131. He also played in the 2007 World Pool Masters, defeating Naoyuki Ōi 8–3 in the first round before losing 3–8 in the quarter-finals to David Alcaide. Ortmann reached the quarter-finals of the 2008 world straight pool championship (which he won the previous year) before losing to Jasmin Ouschan 133–200. He progressed to the semi-finals the following year, defeating Earl Herring and Jonni Fulcher before losing to Mika Immonen. Ortmann won his third world championship in 2010, defeating Immonen in the straight-pool final. Since the straight-pool tournament (also known as the World Tournament) is no longer sanctioned by the WPA, Ortmann remains the last official world straight-pool champion. He is the second player to win three world championships, after Earl Strickland (who won the nine-ball championship in 1990, 1991 and 2002). ===Later career (2010–present)=== Ortmann reached the semifinals of the 2010 World Pool Masters in May of that year by defeating Darren Appleton, Thorsten Hohmann and Thomas Engert before losing 3–8 to Toru Kuribayashi. He entered the 2011 WPA World Eight-ball Championship and defeated Mika Immonen 7–2 in the double-elimination round before losing in the round of 32 to Ronato Alcano. Ortmann defeated in the first knockout round, followed by Nick van den Berg and Li Hewen, before losing to eventual champion Chang Jung-Lin the following year. His Euro Tour wins include the 2009 Netherlands Open. This victory, Ortmann's 14th on the tour, placed him second on the all-time list of winners behind Ralf Souquet (23). He has reached the semi-finals of a tour event 35 times, with 8 second-place finishes. Ortmann was inducted into the Straight Pool Hall of Fameduring a ceremony in New York City in August 2013. Two years earlier, he said: \"It would be a great honor for me to be one day inducted into the Straight Pool Hall of Fame with the greatest players in straight pool.\" In 2014, Ortmann was inducted into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame with Charles Ursitti. He is a three-time European player of the year, receiving the award in 1990, 1993, and 1996. ===Team events=== Ortmann first represented Europe at the Mosconi Cup in the first competition in 1994 with the USA winning 16–12. The following year, Ortmann competed in the Continent's first win, and Ortmann was also on the winning side in 2002. The 2002 victory with Ortmann was described by six-time snooker world champion Steve Davis as \"one of the best moments of my career\". Ortmann competed in the team on eight occasions (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2004), and was the non-playing captain in 2003. Ortmann's eight appearances is the fifth most of any European player. At the World Cup of Pool, Ortmann has represented Germany three times.
