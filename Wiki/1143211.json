The album is a blend of pop rock and traditional Irish folk music, marking the beginning of The Corrs' international success. Produced by David Foster, it became a commercial hit, particularly in Ireland, Australia, and several European countries. == Background and Recording == The Corrs, a family band consisting of siblings Andrea Corr (lead vocals, tin whistle), Sharon Corr (violin, backing vocals), Caroline Corr (drums, bodhrán, backing vocals), and Jim Corr (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), had been performing locally before attracting the attention of producer David Foster. After an audition in Los Angeles, Foster signed the band to his label, 143 Records, under Atlantic Records, and produced Forgiven, Not Forgotten. The album was recorded in Malibu, California and saw the group combining their Irish musical roots with contemporary pop and rock production. The album showcases Andrea’s lead vocals, Sharon’s violin, and a mixture of traditional Irish instruments alongside more modern production techniques. == Musical style and themes == Forgiven, Not Forgotten blends pop, rock, and Celtic influences. The album includes both uptempo pop songs and instrumental tracks featuring traditional Irish melodies. Themes in the album revolve around love, loss, and forgiveness, a reflection of the emotional depth in the band’s songwriting. Notable tracks include: * \"Runaway\", a love ballad that became one of their signature songs. * \"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\", the title track that combines rock elements with a melancholic Celtic mood. * Instrumental tracks like \"Erin Shore\" and \"Toss the Feathers\", which showcase the band’s Irish heritage. == Singles == Several singles were released from Forgiven, Not Forgotten, many of which contributed to the band's rising popularity: # \"Runaway\" – The album's standout hit, a soft ballad that received extensive airplay, especially after its re-release in 1999. # \"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\" – A haunting, rhythmic track combining pop and folk elements, which became another radio favorite. # \"The Right Time\" – A more upbeat pop track that further showcased the band’s versatility. # \"Love to Love You\" – A catchy, upbeat song that helped maintain the album's momentum in several markets. == Critical reception == Critics generally praised Forgiven, Not Forgotten for its polished production and unique blend of genres. AllMusic gave the album positive reviews for its catchy melodies and the seamless integration of Irish folk elements with mainstream pop-rock. The Corrs were also lauded for their musicianship, particularly Sharon’s violin work and Andrea’s evocative vocals.
