However, in the modern APG III system of classification,Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2009. An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 161 (2): 105â€“121. asterid and euasterid are names for clades. Their member families are similar to those of the Asteridae. One of the better-known systems that recognized subclass Asteridae was the Cronquist system, which included the orders: * Gentianales * Solanales * Lamiales * Callitrichales * Plantaginales * Scrophulariales * Campanulales * Rubiales * Dipsacales * Calycerales * Asterales Most of the above orders as defined by Cronquist have been dramatically redefined on the basis of recent molecular systematic studies. == References == Category:Asterids",
