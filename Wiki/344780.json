 "text": "Managed services is the practice of outsourcing day-to-day management work. It is a calculated way for improved operations inclusive of production support and life cycle build/maintenance activities. The business owner or administrator, who has direct oversight of the organization or system being managed, is referred to as the client, or customer. The person or organization that manages and provides the service is regarded as the service provider. It is an alternative to the break/fix or on-demand outsourcing model where the service provider performs on-demand services and bills the customer only for the work done. == Related pages == * Outsourcing ==References== Category:Business Category:Management Category:Marketing",
