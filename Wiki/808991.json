This is because the sensor lacks an IPR filter. OnePlus later asked for an apology for \"creating privacy issues and causing problems to OnePlus users and other network users\" and temporarily disabled the filter on Chinese models from HydrogenOS. OxygenOS 10.5.9 has disabled the filter worldwide. However, OnePlus later stated that it was a mistake, and subsequently pulled the update. With the upcoming update, the filter should return. This feature was still available after enabling the ADB command. ==Other websites== * * Category:OnePlus mobile phones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020 Category:Mobile phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording",
