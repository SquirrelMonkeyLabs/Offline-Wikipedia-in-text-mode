The group is important because it includes all living sharks, skates, and rays. They rapidly diversified during the Upper Triassic. The group is descended from a primitive type of shark in the Devonian period.Underwood C.J. 2006. Diversification of the Neoselachii (Chondrichthyes) during the Jurassic and Cretaceous (PDF).
