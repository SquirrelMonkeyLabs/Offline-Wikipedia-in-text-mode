Common marmosets eat gum, sap, latex, and resin from trees the most out of all the members of the Callithrix family.Kinzey WG. 1997. \"Synopsis of New World primates (16 genera) \".

Oxford (England): Oxford Univ Pr. p 262-72. A common group of marmosets is made up of 15 members, but usually has nine members.Stevenson MF, Rylands AB. (1988) \"The marmosets, genus Callithrix\". In: Mittermeier RA, Rylands AB, Coimbra-Filho AF, da Fonseca GAB, editors. Ecology and behavior of neotropical primates, Volume 2. Washington DC: World Wildlife Fund. p 131-222. Common marmosets have a complex mating system. In a group of marmosets, there will usually be one or two females that will have babies and one male to be the father. The females are usually closely related, while the male is distantly related. If the male dies, the group will break up and form new groups. When marmosets get older, they leave the group they were raised with. It is not known why.Ferrari SF, Lopes Ferrari MA. (1989) \"A re- evaluation of the social organization of the Callitrichidae, with reference to the ecological differences between genera\". Folia Primatol 52: 132-47. To show fear or submission, marmosets flatten their ear-tufts close to their heads. Marmoset alarm calls tend to be brief and high-pitched. Marmosets monitor and find group members with calls called \"trills\".Lazaro-Perea C.
