 "text": "\"This is the Home of the Brave\" (, ) is the national anthem of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Afghanistan during Taliban rule). It was first used between 1996 and 2001, but was adopted again in 2021 after the Fall of Kabul. This is when the Taliban took over the capital city of Kabul. This song is an a cappella song, meaning that the song has no instruments, just words. Many Islamic scholars (called ulama) consider instruments to be haram (or taboo), and the use of instruments is forbidden. == Lyrics == === Pashto original === Arabic script Latin script IPA transcription === Translations === Dari translation English translation We defend thee with our blood, this is the home of martyrs 𝄆 This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave 𝄇 We defend thee with our blood, this is the home of martyrs 𝄆 This is the home of the brave, this is the home of the brave 𝄇 I All thy stones and bushes look like rubies to us 𝄆 All thy stones and bushes look like rubies to us 𝄇 Upon them blood is spilt, they are all red like roses 𝄆 Upon them blood is spilt, they are all red like roses 𝄇 𝄆 Dost thou think 'tis conquerable?
