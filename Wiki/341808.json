 "text": "The Vice President of Argentina is a senior official of Argentina who integrates the electoral team accompanying the citizen who is elected President of Argentina, and whose main function is to replace him in case of temporary absence, or in case of permanent absence for disability, death or resignation. In Argentine history, there have also been de facto vice presidents, imposed as a result of coups d'état, although not all governments headed by de facto presidents had the presence of a vice president. This is the second highest political position in Argentina. The Vice President replaces the President if the President cannot do the job. The vice president is not a member of the National Executive Power and only assumes the presidency in the absence or inability of the president to exercise power. The following is the list of vice presidents of the Argentine Confederation and the Argentine Republic, taking into account that the first was a state that did not include the Province of Buenos Aires, which at that time also included the City of Buenos Aires: == List of vice presidents == === Argentine Confederation (1854–1861) === Portrait Name Term of office Elections Political party President Notes Start End Salvador María del Carril (1798–1883) 5 March 1854 5 March 1860 1853 Unitarian Justo José de Urquiza Juan Esteban Pedernera (1796–1886) 5 March 1860 4 November 1861 1860 Unitarian Santiago Derqui Assumed the presidency after the resignation of Santiago Derqui. colspan=7 Juan Esteban Pedernera Juan Esteban Pedernera resigned. === Argentine Republic (1861–present) === Portrait Name Term of office Elections Political party (Coalition) President Notes Start End colspan=7 Bartolomé Mitre Marcos Paz (1811–1868) 12 October 1862 2 January 1868 1862 Liberal Acting president between 12 June 1865 and 2 January 1868.
