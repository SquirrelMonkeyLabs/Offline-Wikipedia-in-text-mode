 "text": "In the United States of America, there has id,ccc.4.0usually only been two main political parties. But there are many different factions with varying viewpoints within the two main parties. Since the 1860s, the two main parties have been the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Currently, the Republican Party has the most seats in the House of Representatives while the Democrats have the most seats in the Senate. The Vice President, a Democrat, holds a tie breaking vote in the United States Senate. The United States currently has two major political parties: the Democrats and the Republicans. But there are other parties that aren't as represented in the United States government and are usually underfunded or misrepresented. Usually these smaller parties arenâ€™t as well known, which makes it difficult for them to win elections. The major parties have a duopoly, meaning that they share almost all the political power in the country. Most constitutional republic countries have more than two parties. For other political parties not listed, see List of political parties in the United States. == Political parties in Congress == These two parties have members in the United States Congress, the legislative branch of the United States government. They are also called \"major parties\". ===Democratic Party=== The Democratic Party was started in 1828 as a pro- slavery party and the first President was Andrew Jackson in 1829. However, through the economic resurgence after the Great Depression in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the Democratic party became a proponent of racial equality. Many 20th century United States Presidents such as Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and 21st century presidents such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden are Democrats. They have 48 out of 100 seats in the U.S. Senate (independents caucusing with the democratic party hold two seats in the U.S. senate) and 222 out of 435 seats in the House of Representatives. 24 out of 50 state governors are also Democrats. The party generally promotes liberalism and is often classed as a center-left to left- wing party. Currently, the party has 60 million registered voters across America. The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, anti-gun laws, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy. ===Republican Party=== The Republican Party was started in 1854 as an anti-slavery party and its first President was Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Others include Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump. In the Nixon years, there was a shift to appeal to the implicit racial biases of white voters that did not like the civil rights movement of the 1960's in what is called the southern strategy. This strategy created the appearance of equity while ignoring minorities in the process. 26 out of 50 states have a Republican governor. It has around 55 million registered voters across America. Currently, the Republican Party is identified as conservative. The party philosophy centers around social and economic independence, and a capitalist economic system. It is also known for its anti-abortion efforts, pro-gun laws, anti-regulatory policy, and reduction of government intervention in the economy as well as being in support of privatized health care. The party believes in lower taxes, less social programs, and personal liberty.
