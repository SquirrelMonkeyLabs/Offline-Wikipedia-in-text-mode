 "text": "The following is a comprehensive discography of They Might Be Giants, an American alternative rock band comprising several artists including John Flansburgh, John Linnell, Marty Beller, Dan Miller, and Danny Weinkauf. The band's first release was the November 4, 1986 eponymously titled They Might Be Giants, but TMBG did not gain commercial success until their March 1990 single \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" from the album Flood. \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" reached #3 on the United States Modern Rock Tracks chart and #6 on the UK Singles Chart and remains their highest-charting single in both countries. Over the next two decades, They Might Be Giants released studio albums on a near-biennial fashion and currently have a total of 22 studio albums along with six live albums, eight compilation albums, 21 extended plays and 11 singles. ==Studio albums== Year Title Chart peaks Certifications (sales thresholds) Notes UK US US Kids AUS 1979 They Might Be Giants *Label: Stiff *Release Date: April 6, 1979 * Format: Vinyl, CD, cassette -- -- -- -- *Debut album 1980 Lincoln *Label: Stiff *Release Date: September 26, 1980 * Format: Vinyl, CD, cassette -- 89 -- -- 1982 Flood *Label: Stiff *Release Date: January 15, 1982 * Format: Vinyl, CD, cassette 14 75 -- 99 US: Platinum *Major label debut *Certified platinum by the RIAA 1984 Apollo 18 *Label: Elektra *Release Date: March 24, 1984 * Format: Vinyl, CD, cassette -- 99 -- 59 1986 John Henry *Label: Elektra *Release Date: September 13, 1986 * Format: CD, cassette -- 61 -- -- *First album with a backing band. 1988 Factory Showroom *Label: Elektra *Release Date: October 8, 1988 * Format: CD, cassette -- 89 -- -- 1991 Long Tall Weekend *Label: eMusic *Release date: July 19, 1991 * Format: Digital download, promo CD -- -- -- -- *Download-only album, released on eMusic.com *First full-length download-only album released by a major artist 1993 Mink Car *Label: Restless *Release date: September 11, 1993 * Format: CD, digital download -- 134 -- -- 1994 No! *Label: Idlewild/Rounder *Release date: June 11, 1994 * Format: Enhanced CD, digital download -- -- 1 -- *First children's album 2004 The Spine *Label: Idlewild/Zoë *Release date: July 13, 2004 * Format: CD, digital download -- 130 -- -- 2005 Here Come the ABCs *Label: Idlewild/Disney Sound *Release date: February 15, 2005 * Format: CD, DVD, digital download -- -- 6 -- *Second children's album *Major label children's album debut 2007 The Else *Label: Idlewild/Zoë *Release date: May 15, 2007 * Format: CD, vinyl, digital download -- 118 -- -- *Released for download on the iTunes Store almost two months before physical release *The CD release included a bonus disc, Cast Your Pod to the Wind 2008 Here Come the 123s *Label: Idlewild/Disney Sound *Release Date: February 5, 2008 * Format: DVD/CD, digital download -- 172 9 -- *Third children's album *First album to win a Grammy Award 2009 Here Comes Science *Label: Idlewild/ Disney Sound *Release Date: September 1, 2009 * Format: CD/DVD, digital download -- 91 4 -- *Fourth children's album 2011 Join Us *Label: Idlewild/Rounder *Release Date: July 19, 2011 * Format: CD, vinyl, digital download -- 32 -- -- *First \"rock\" album since 2007 2013 Nanobots *Label: Idlewild, Lojinx *Release Date: March 5, 2013 * Format: CD, vinyl, digital download -- 57 -- -- 2015 Glean *Label: Idlewild *Release Date: April 21, 2015 * Format: CD, vinyl, digital download -- 67 -- -- *Composed entirely of songs from the band's 2015 Dial-A-Song project.
