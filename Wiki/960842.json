Usually in a dancing game, you follow the rules or dances shown on the screen and follow them to the best you can and score the most points to win. Most dancing games, you usually dance while music is playing to help you get into rhythm. == History == The first dancing created in 1987 was Dance Aerobics where you get into fit while dancing. In 1998 a new dancing game called Dance Dance Revolution by Konami. In Dance Dance Revolution, you follow the arrows on the screen with your feet while it goes to music. You can find Dance Dance Revolution or copies of it in arcades. In 2009, a new dancing game called Just Dance was released. In Just Dance, you must hold the controller(Wii remote, switch controller, phone app, PS Move) or use the Kinect or PS4 Camera to dance. You have to hold the controller in your right hand and follow the dancer(s) on screen like a reflection. Just Dance is normally a fun family party game that you can find in homes but it has grown to where it is competitive. == Related pages == * Dance Dance Revolution * Just Dance (video game series) ==References== video game Category:Video game genres",
