 "text": "A cloaking device or invisibility cloak has long been featured in science fiction. Attempts have been made to devise a way to do it with objects, but results were disappointing until now. A paper in Nature Communications for September 2013 announces a new approach.Hongsheng Chen 2013. Ray-optics cloaking devices for large objects in incoherent natural light. Nature Communications. 4, 2652. :\"Invisibility cloaking was almost inconceivable until the ingenious theory of macroscopic invisibility cloaking was proposed based on transformation optics principles.Leonhardt U. 2006. Optical conformal mapping. Science 312, 1777–1780.Pendry J.B; Schurig D. & Smith D.R. 2006. Controlling electromagnetic fields. Science 312, 1780–1782. ... We successfully demonstrate the cloaking of living creatures, a cat and a fish, from the eye. From reference 1, the two \"supplementary movies\" show the successful cloaking of a goldfish and a cat so far as they are within the experimental space. == Overview == A recent review said these methods were possible: Summary is from Morgan, James 2013. New 'invisibility cloak' type designed. BBC Science & Technology. Monticone, Francesco & Alù Andrea 2013. Do cloaked objects really scatter less? Physical Review X, 3, #4. #Optical camouflage: A modified background image is projected onto a cloak of reflective material (the kind used to make projector screens). The wearer becomes invisible to anyone standing at the projection source. #The \"mirage effect\": Electric current is passed through submerged carbon nanotubes to create very high local temperatures. This causes light to bounce off them, hiding objects behind. #Adaptive heat cloaking: A camera records background temperatures, these are displayed by sheets of hexagonal pixels which change temperature very quickly, camouflaging even moving vehicles from heat- sensitive cameras. #Calcite crystal prism: Calcite crystals send the two polarizations of light in different directions. By fixing prism-shaped crystals together in a particular way, polarised light can be directed around small objects. This effectively cloaks them. == References == Category:Optics Category:Science fiction",
