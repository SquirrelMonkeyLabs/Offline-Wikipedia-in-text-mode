 "text": "Ferdinand Magellan (1480 â€“ 27 April 1521) was a Portuguese explorer. He became the first European to sail the Pacific Ocean, and the first to sail around the world. Though ancient Greek philosophers and astronomers had proposed that the earth was round as early as the 5th century BC, Magellan's voyage confirmed this. == Early life == Magellan was born in 1480. Records disagree about whether he was born in Sabrosa or Porto in Portugal.Daniel Rogers, Magellan and da gama Magellan's parents were members of the Portuguese nobility. As a result, after they died, Magellan was able to get a job in the royal court. At age 10, he became a page for the Queen of Portugal. In the royal court, he learned many important skills, including map-making, navigation and astronomy. == Accomplishments == In 1505 Magellan joined the Portuguese navy. He traveled to many parts of the world, such as India, the Spice Islands, East Africa, and Morocco. He was wounded in Morocco in 1513, and walked with a limp for the rest of his life. After he lost his job for the King of Portugal, Magellan went to work for the King of Spain, Charles V.Charles V gave Magellan five ships for his voyage around the world. Only one ship, the Victoria, completed the voyage. In 1520, during his circumnavigation voyage, Magellan became the first European to sail through the Strait of Magellan (which was then named for him). == Death == Magellan was killed in Mactan, Philippines on April 27, 1521, aged 40-41. He was accused of stealing from the native people, which led to a battle. He was killed by a Filipino leader called Lapulapu and his warriors. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * made by Noor Mohammad I.
