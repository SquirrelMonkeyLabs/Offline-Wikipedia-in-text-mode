This means the sound is made by curling the tongue back in the mouth and letting the air flow through the nose. For example, the word “अणु” (aṇu), which means “atom” in Sanskrit, is pronounced like “aṇu”. == Usage in different languages == === Sanskrit === Also see: Sanskrit language The letter ṇ is used in many Sanskrit words.
