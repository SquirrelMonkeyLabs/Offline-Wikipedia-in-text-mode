 "text": "The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s and 1930s when jazz music and dance styles became popular. The Jazz Age came first in the United States, where jazz started in New Orleans. It came from the culture of African Americans. Jazz played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on popular culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to with the Roaring Twenties. It overlapped in significant cross-cultural ways with the Prohibition Era. It was affected by the introduction of radios. During this time, the Jazz Age was intertwined with the developing youth culture. It spread into Europe. ==References== Category:Jazz music Category:1920s in the United States",
