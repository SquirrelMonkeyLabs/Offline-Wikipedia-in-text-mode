 "text": "For the Rosario Railroad station to Puerto Belgrano, see Bajo Hondo Train Station. Bajo Hondo Train Station is a railway station, located in Bajo Hondo town, Coronel Rosales Municipality, in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. == Services == It is a small station of the branch belonging to the General Roca Railway, from the Tandil to the Bahía Blanca station. It does not provide passenger services. == History == The station was founded in 1891 by the British capital company. Although it had been founded as the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (BAGS), it was almost immediately called the Ferrocarril del Sud. The Bajo Hondo station was one of the 504 active stations that the company had until its nationalization. During the presidency of General Juan Domingo Perón, that company was renamed General Roca Railroad until today. The date of inauguration of this station also doubles as the birth date of the Bajo hondo town. Since the privatizations of the state-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos in the 90's, the Bajo hondo train station stopped providing services to passengers. The station is currently inactive. The building at the station has a certain degree of deterioration, and is currently used as a private home. == References == Category:Railway stations in South America Category:Rail transport in Argentina Category:Buenos Aires Province",
