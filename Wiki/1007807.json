 "text": "The Patsarlamdam flying frog, Yunnan flying frog, Gongshan tree frog, or Burmese gliding tree frog (Zhangixalus burmanus) is a frog. It lives in China, Myanmar, India, and Bhutan. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have not seen it on farms, but sometimes people see it near towns or houses. People have seen this frog between 1000 and 2080 meters above sea level. This frog lays eggs near pools of rainwater. It hatches out of its egg as a tadpole. Scientists say that this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. But people cut down forests to get wood to build with and make farms. Sometimes people catch this frog to eat. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
