Since they joined the EU in 2004, they are free to live in other EU countries, including the UK. There are many Russian language schools in London and the South East. These schools were founded by immigrants from Russia to the United Kingdom. They send their children to the schools so the children can learn about their parents' culture. == Other websites == *Russian shops in the United Kingdom *British Russian Society *Понаехали тут!
