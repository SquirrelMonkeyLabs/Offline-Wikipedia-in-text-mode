 "text": "Miguel Ángel Indurain Larraya (born July 16, 1964) is a Spanish retired road racing cyclist. He was a professional cyclist from 1985 to 1996. He was the first person to win the Tour de France five times in a row from 1991 to 1995. He also won the Giro d'Italia two times, in 1992 and 1993. In 1994, he cycled 53.040 kilometres in one hour, which was a new hour record. He also won the Olympic Gold medal for the time trial in 1996. Indurain was very good at time trials. In the five Tours de France that he won, he only won two stages that were not time trials. He finished time trials much quicker than other cyclists, so he did not need to attack in mountain stages. In the 1996 Tour de France, he had a bad cold and he could not win. He retired later in 1997. == Achievements == ;Tour de France finishings : 1985: Withdrew, 4th stage : 1986: Withdrew, 8th stage : 1987: 97th : 1988: 47th : 1989: 17th : 1990: 10th : 1991: 1st : 1992: 1st : 1993: 1st : 1994: 1st : 1995: 1st : 1996: 11th ;Giro d'Italia finishings : 1992: 1st : 1993: 1st : 1994: 3rd ;Vuelta a España finishings : 1985: 84th : 1986: 92nd : 1987: Withdrew : 1988: Withdrew : 1989: Withdrew : 1990: 7th : 1991: 2nd : 1996: Withdrew, 12th stage ; Major results : World Time-Trial Championship (1995) : Summer Olympics Men's Individual Time Trial (1996) : Dauphiné Libéré (1995, 1996) : Paris-Nice (1989, 1990) : Clásica de San Sebastián (1990) : Critérium International (1989) : Grand prix du Midi Libre (1995) : Volta a Catalunya (1988, 1991, 1992) : Tour de l'Avenir (1986) ; Accolades ya boi emilio : French Légion d'honneur : Prince of Asturias Awards: Sports (1992) : Active member – Laureus World Sports Academy : 1995 ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year Category:1964 births Category:Giro d'Italia winners Category:Living people Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:People from Navarre Category:Spanish cyclists Category:Olympic gold medalists for Spain Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Tour de France winners",
