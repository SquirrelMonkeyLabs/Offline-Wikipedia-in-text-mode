 "text": "Daniel Faulkner (December 21, 1955 â€“ December 9, 1981) was a Philadelphia police officer who was murdered on December 9, 1981 by Mumia Abu-Jamal. Abu- Jamal received the death penalty which was later reduced to a life sentence without parole. The circumstances surrounding the conviction has led activists to unsuccessfully protest for Abu-Jamal's release from prison. All of Mumia Abu-Jamal's appeals have been denied. Faulkner was 25 years old at the time of his death. Faulkner was murdered after apprehending William Cook, the brother of Mumia Abu-Jamal during a traffic stop at the intersection of 13th and Locust Streets in Philadelphia. He was shot five times by Mumia Abu-Jamal, but was able to shoot back and hit Abu-Jamal in the abdominal area. He died several hours later at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. == Maureen Faulkner's legal battles against Mumia Abu-Jamal == Maureen Faulkner, Daniel's widow, has been fighting against Mumia Abu-Jamal's appeals since he was incarcerated. She published a book \"Murdered by Mumia,\" which was co-authored by legal expert Michael A. Smerconish. The book describes her brief marriage to Daniel Faulkner and recaps his murder. It also provides detailed accounts of the evidence against Abu-Jamal. She has also posted a website, www.danielfaulkner.org, detailing numerous rebuttals of the allegations of wrongdoing by the Prosecution, racism in the trial, and claims of Abu-Jamal's possible innocence. Abu-Jamal's latest appeal was denied by Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Lucretia Clemons. Judge Clemons claimed in her brief that Abu-Jamal's claims lack substance for a new trial. The fact that Judge Clemons is black also has Abu-Jamal's opponents arguing that he is not the victim of racism, as his supporters have claimed. Abu-Jamal has continued to maintain his innocence. == Early Life and Education == Daniel Faulkner was born on December 21, 1955 to Thomas and Mary Faulkner. His parents were of Irish decent. His father, Thomas, was a trolley driver and died of heart and liver ailments when Daniel was just ten years old. This left his mother, Mary to raise their seven children as a young widow: Thomas Jr., Joseph, Joanne, Lawrence, Patrick, Ken, and Daniel. Faulkner grew up in the city of Philadelphia, PA where he attended Most Blessed Sacrament Elementary School, West Catholic Boys High School, and John Bartram High School. He served in the U.S. Army from 1972 until 1974. He was honorably discharged and received a National Defense Service Medal. He received his GED on September 23, 1974. Faulkner worked briefly as a prison guard in Delaware County before joining the Philadelphia Police Department, where he was appointed to the Police Academy in May of 1976. He was working toward an Associate Degree in Criminal Justice at the time of his death. ==Marriage and Law Enforcement Career== Daniel Faulkner married the former Maureen Foley on November 8,1980 after two years of dating. They met on the Jersey Shore. Officer Faulkner had served for five and a half years with the Philadelphia Police Department. On November 3, 1976, he received a commendation of merit for \"aggressive patrol procedures\" following the arrest of Myron Cherry. Cherry had committed a robbery at a grocery store at 1800 West Montgomery Ave. Faulkner received an additional Citation of Merit on August 26, 1978 for apprehending fleeing suspect Michael Jones, for the attempted robbery of an elderly man. On November 5, 1979, Officer Faulkner earned a Commendation for Merit for apprehending two suspects in the middle of attempting a robbery at Broad Street and Girard while they attempted to flee the scene.
