Steyer is the founder and former Co-Senior Managing Partner of Farallon Capital Management, LLC and the co-founder of Beneficial State Bank. In 2017, Steyer spent around $10 million for a television ad campaign advocating the impeachment of President Donald Trump and plans to spend millions more on a digital ad campaign to call for Trump's impeachment. Steyer thought about running for Governor of California in the 2018 gubernatorial election as a stance against President Trump. Steyer was on the Board of Trustees at Stanford University from 2012 to 2017. On July 9, 2019, Steyer announced his candidacy for President of the United States in the 2020 election. He stated that he would be running in the Democratic primaries in an online campaign video. He dropped out of the race after losing the South Carolina primary on February 29, 2020. Steyer spent $250 million of his own money on his campaign. This was more than any other candidate in history, except Mike Bloomberg's campaign. ==References== ==Other websites== *Farallon Capital Management *Hellman & Friedman LLC * OneCalifornia Bank *TomKat Ranch Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:American philanthropists Category:American environmentalists Category:American human rights activists Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Politicians from New York City Category:Businesspeople from San Francisco Category:Politicians from San Francisco Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:2020 United States presidential candidates",
