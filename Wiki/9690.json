 "text": "A parody is a special piece of art. Parodies make fun of another piece of art by mocking it. The parody is an imitation of the original, but exaggerating it, showing clich√©s which have been used, to make the original look ridiculous or to make a comment about an issue affecting society. For example, in a serious Western movie, the good guys always seem to shoot better and faster than the bad guys. In a Western parody, this might be exaggerated by showing a good guy firing a single shot, and a dozen of the bad guys falling from their horses as a result. Mel Brooks is a director who has made many movies which are parodies: * Blazing Saddles is a parody of Western movies in general, * Spaceballs is a parody of the Star Wars movies, and science fiction in general, * Men in Tights is a parody of Robin Hood movies, The website Uncyclopedia is also a parody of Wikipedia. Parodies can be anything from songs to poems to books to movies. A movie that makes a parody of another movie or several movies at once is a parody movie. Newspaper columnists are well known for their strip cartoons which can very often parody public opinion on major issues affecting society, such as the recent credit crunch. == Related pages == * Irony * Satire * Parody mass",
