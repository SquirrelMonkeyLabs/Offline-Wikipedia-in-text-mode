 "text": "Blackwall is a district of London, England, located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It also forms part of the Port of London. Blackwall can be broadly described today as the area close to the River Thames from the edge of the Isle of Dogs and as far east as the East India Docks on the Leanouth peninsula. The area takes its name from a historic stretch of riverside wall built along an outside curve of the River Thames, to protect the area from flooding. Blackwall today is mostly residential but Blackwall Yard provides moorings for boats. Category:Areas of London",
