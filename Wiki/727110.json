It is available for Windows XP and later; the Windows 8 version takes over the Start screen to imitate a look and feel of the second generation Start menu in earlier versions of Windows. Pokki is adware, according to Malwaretips. Meanwhile, Sophos AV has said Pokki is \"viruses and spyware\". ==History== Pokki first launched as a beta version in June 2011. Pokki's framework is built on Chromium, allowing developers to make desktop applications with normal internet languages, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. In April 2012, Pokki launched the Pokki Store, a marketplace and app store for desktop apps for social networking services and social gaming apps. With the Pokki Store, users can browse, search, and download applications in various categories. Developers submit applications using the Pokki Developer Center. In August 2012, Pokki finished being in the beta stage. It said it had 1 million monthly active users. It released the Pokki Menu, an app launcher for access, management, and discovery of its apps, and a notification center for real-time updates. In October 2012, Pokki for Windows 8 was released as a free software download to bring back core things to the Windows Start menu that had been removed from Windows 8. It had about 1.5 million users as of January 2013.Yahoo! News, Jan. 16, 2013 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Microsoft Windows software",
