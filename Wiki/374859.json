Former versions showed a number of customers in a barbershop, all with another religious and racial background. He found it to be difficult to make clear images that showed how a person of a certain religion looks like. He finally chose a neutral location where people of different race worship in their own religion. He took Vermont neighbors as models for his series. The paintings toured through the United States with the motto Buy War Bonds. All together 1.2 million Americans saw the paintings and 132 million dollar was collected to be used in World War II.Michener Art Museum (8 augustus 2007) Pairs Famed American Illustrators Rockwell and Hargens for Fall Exhibitions in New Hope The painting can be found in the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. == References == *Parts of this article are derived from the article on English Wikipedia Category:1943 paintings Category:American paintings",
