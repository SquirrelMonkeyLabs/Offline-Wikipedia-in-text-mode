 "text": "The Bronze Age in Korea is divided into two main phases: the Early Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age. Key developments during this era include the spread of agricultural practices, as seen in the rise of rice farming, as well as significant changes in burial practices. People began using stone and bronze tools for farming and daily life, and several different burial methods, such as dolmens (large stone tombs) and earthen tombs, were used. During this time, new ceramic styles also emerged, like plain pottery, which was commonly found with bronze items. Evidence of cultural exchange between Korea and other regions, such as China, suggests that ideas and technologies were shared across borders, though the exact routes remain unclear. Additionally, the Bronze Age saw the establishment of societal structures with elites and labor specialization. Category:History of Korea Category:Bronze Age",
