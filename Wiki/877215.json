 "text": "EveryDoctor is a British grassroots campaigning and advocacy group made up of National Health Service doctors. The group started in 2019, and grew during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In May 2021, EveryDoctor and the Good Law Project brought legal action against the British government. This was about COVID-19 PPE contracts made during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. They accused the Department of Health and Social Care of breaking the law in the way they bought PPE supplies. They also claimed that the PPE was no good and led to the deaths of medical professionals from COVID-19. == References == == Other websites == * EveryDoctor website Category:Organisations based in the United Kingdom",
