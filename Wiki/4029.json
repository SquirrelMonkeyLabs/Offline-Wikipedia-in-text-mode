 "text": "Yoshi is a fictional dinosaur who appears in the Mario series of video games made by Nintendo. The character was created by Shigeru Miyamoto. Yoshi's best- known ability is his ability to eat enemies. He has a long frog-like tongue which he uses to eat enemies and items. In some games, after Yoshi eats enemies, they can be turned into eggs, which can be thrown. One of Yoshi's companions is Mario who helps Yoshi throughout dangerous situations. Most of the time, Mario can ride Yoshi. Yoshi also can jump very high, and can also float in the air a little bit by kicking his legs. He can also ground pound enemies by quickly jumping on them. Yoshis are usually green, but can come in many other colors. These other colors include green, red, light blue, blue, purple, pink, yellow, orange, brown, black, and white. Blue Yoshi is especially in Super Mario World. In Super Mario 64 DS, Rec Room there's a light blue color in one of Yoshi's minigames Tox Box. In Vs Mode multiplayer, it has a dark blue color and the third player can play him. In a few games like Super Mario World Yoshi gains powers, like flying, shooting fireballs when spat out, ground pounding, or all three by holding certain colored koopa troopa shells in its mouth. Yoshi first appeared in the game Super Mario World (SNES), which was released in 1990 in Japan and 1991 in the United States. ==Yoshi series== * Yoshi (video game) * Yoshi's Cookie * Yoshi's Safari * Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island * Yoshi's Story * Yoshi's Universal Gravitation/Topsy Turvy * Yoshi Touch & Go * Yoshi's Island DS * Yoshi's New Island * Yoshi's Woolly World * Yoshi's Crafted World ==Other appearances== *Mario Kart 64 (N64) *Mario Kart: Super Circuit (GBA) *Mario Kart DS (DS) *Mario Kart Wii (Wii) *Mario Kart 7 (3DS) *Mario Kart 8 (Deluxe) (Wii U/Switch) *Mario Party series (N64, GCN, DS, and Wii) *Super Mario 64 DS (DS) (Vs Mode multiplayer only, the one with the game card is Green Yoshi, others are Red, Blue, and Yellow Yoshi. *Super Mario Kart (SNES) *Super Mario Sunshine (GCN) *Super Smash Bros.
