 "text": "The sierra rocket frog or Péfaur's rocket frog (Aromobates serranus) is a frog. Scientists found it in Mérida, Venezuela. ==Home== The adult frogs live in and near streams in cloud forests. Scientists saw the frog between 1800 and 2300 meters above sea level. Scientists think the frog might live in one protected place: Parque Nacional Sierra Nevada. ==Young== The female frogs lays eggs on land. The male frogs watch the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out and that they could all be dead already. Scientists say that there are probably 50 or fewer adult frogs alive now. Human beings changed the places where the frog lived to make farms and places for people to raise animals. Trout fish that people brought to the frog's home also kill this frog. But because many frogs died even in places that human beings had not changed, scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also have killed many frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
