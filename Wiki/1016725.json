 "text": "The Nagaland tree frog (Theloderma nagalandense) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in two places. Both places are in Nagaland State, one 1196 meters above sea level and one 1421 meters above sea level. Scientists found one frog near a town, so they think the frogs might be able to live in places that humans have changed. They think the frogs probably live in trees and lay eggs in holes in trees that have water in them because that is what other frogs in Theloderma do, but they do not know for sure. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
