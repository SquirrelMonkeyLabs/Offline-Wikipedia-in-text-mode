The story was written by Tom Junod and appeared in the September 2003 issue of Esquire magazine. It is about the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City. The man in the photo, Jonathan Briley, is known as The Falling Man. He himself had worked in the twin towers and was shown on video attempting to climb down the side of the tower using a rope likely made from clothing. He either lost his grip or the rope broke, and he plunged to his death. His fall was captured in the famous photo. Category:September 11 attacks",
