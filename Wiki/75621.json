 "text": "The Five Pillars of Islam are five basic rules in Islam that all Muslims must follow. The Five Pillars consist of : # Shahadah - The shahadah means there is no other god except Allah (one God) and Prophet Muhammad is the messenger/prophet of Allah. The shahadah can be recited when a person chooses to revert to Islam as the words in the shahadah are the key fundamental beliefs in Islam. Shahada is the fundamental declaration of faith in Islam, and according to Islamic theology, it is a prerequisite for the acceptance of deeds. # Prayer (Salat) - Praying five times a day, kneeling towards Mecca (a desert city in Asia). There are specific religious movements and prayers that are said. # Fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm) - Islamic Fasting is not eating or drinking beverages when the sun is out, only when the moon is out. # Charity or alms-giving (zakat) - Each year a Muslim must give money to charity (Usually 2.5% of their savings). If a person does not have much money, they can give services to others instead. # Hajj - Pilgrimage (journey) to Mecca == Sources == Category:Islamic law Category:Religious ethics",
