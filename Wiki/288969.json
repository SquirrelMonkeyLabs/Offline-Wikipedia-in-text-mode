 "text": "Craftsman was a style of architecture in the United States in the early 20th century. It is called that because Gustav Stickley, a craftsman furniture maker, had a magazine called The Craftsman. The movement was part of the Arts and Crafts movement that started in England in the late 19th century. It wanted a \"simpler way of life\" that was not like American and English industrialized society. Architects such as Greene and Greene designed Craftsman homes such as the Gamble House. These houses were well-made, but did not have a lot of ornamentation. Often they played off of natural themes. A smaller version of the craftsman home was the bungalow. By the 1910s, Craftsman bungalows were being built in large numbers in and around American cities. Besides America and England, there was a lot of Craftsman architecture in Japan.
