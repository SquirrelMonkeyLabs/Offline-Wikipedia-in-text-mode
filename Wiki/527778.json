 "text": "Peter Trevor Powell (c. 1932 â€“ 3 January 2016) was an English kite maker. He developed a steerable kite in 1972, using dual lines. Powell's kites had spars made of Gonystylus which were later replaced with aluminium tubing and, later still, by glass fibre spars. Powell's kites came with a long, hollow polyethylene tail that was inflated by the wind. The tail added stability as well as looking good when performing stunts. He was born in Gloucester, Gloucestershire. at SO Glos online magazine Retrieved 5 January 2016 Powell died from a stroke in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire at the age of 83. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Deaths from stroke Category:English inventors Category:People from Gloucestershire",
