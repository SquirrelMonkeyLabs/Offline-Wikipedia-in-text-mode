It is made up of management bodies of high-rise towers, provided that they are open to the public and that they constitute a tourist attraction. It aims at exchanging information to improve their management, sharing experiences, and organizing their international promotion. Joining the association costs $2,000 a year. The 25 participating towers would receive 20 million visitors annually. The list of members is far from exhausting those of high-rise towers open to the public.
