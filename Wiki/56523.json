 "text": "A membrane protein is a protein molecule that is attached to, or associated with the membrane of a cell or an organelle. 20–30% of all genes in genomes code for membrane proteins.Krogh A. et al 2001. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden markov model: application to complete genomes. Journal of Molecular Biology 305 (3): 567–580. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. ==Function== Membrane proteins perform a variety of functions vital to the survival of organisms:Almén M. et al 2009. Mapping the human membrane proteome: a majority of the human membrane proteins can be classified according to function and evolutionary origin. BMC Biology 7: 50. * Membrane receptor proteins relay signals between the cell's internal and external environments. * Membrane transport proteins move molecules and ions across the membrane. * Membrane enzymes have many activities. * Cell adhesion molecules allow cells to identify each other and interact. For example, proteins involved in immune response. ==Related pages== * Ion channel == References == == Other websites == * General principles of membrane protein folding and stability from Stephen White laboratory * Orientations of proteins in membranes (OPM) database 3D structures of integral and amphitropic membrane proteins Category:Molecular biology",
