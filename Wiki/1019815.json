 "text": "Thompson & Morgan is an independent company based in Ipswich, Suffolk. Founded in 1855, they specialize in offering a wide range of English plants, seeds, and gardening supplies through their websites. The company distributes their products through mail order catalogues, online platforms, and retail outlets. They have a vast selection of over 8,000 products showcased on their websites. The company traces its origins back to a small garden behind a baker's shop in Ipswich, where William Thompson's passion for botany began. He cultivated rare and unusual plants from seeds sent to him from around the world. Thompson's nursery grew in size and reputation, and he established friendships with renowned scientists of his time. In 1855, Thompson issued his first catalogue, and the business continued to thrive. John Morgan joined the company, contributing his business expertise, and they became one of the country's leading seed firms. Over the years, Thompson & Morgan experienced growth and expanded its operations. The company went through ownership changes and was eventually acquired by BVG Group in 2017. Today, Thompson & Morgan remains a prominent player in the gardening industry with a wide range of products and a strong presence in the seed market. == References == Category:Companies of the United Kingdom",
