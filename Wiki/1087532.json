 "text": "The Political Compass is a website from Great Britain, that asks people questions to figure out if they’re Left-Authoritarian, Right-Authoritarian, Left-Libertarian or Right-Libertarian. The website asks a lot of questions, ranging from how the user would run the economy to what should be socially acceptable. After all the questions are answered, the website determines where the user would land on the political compass. == Definitions == The Political Compass uses Left to mean supporting Socialism and Right to mean supporting Capitalism. It uses Authoritarian to mean Statist. It uses Libertarian to mean Liberal. == Controversy == The Political Compass has been criticized by a lot of political commentators. Ben Shapiro, Destiny and Steven Crowder have all said that it’s a bad test. The controversy is because of the site's bias towards the Left, with the site's news heavily criticizing conservative politicians in many different world elections while praising far-left politicians. This is an issue because the bias of the owner may alter how the test phrases certain questions and how the website interprets answers. Category:Politics Category:British websites",
