 "text": "Cassoulet is a casserole made particularly in the south of France. It is called after its traditional cooking vessel, the cassole, a deep, round, earthenware pot with slanting sides. The name comes from the Occitan caçolet (or cassolet). It contains meat (usually pork sausages, goose, duck and sometimes mutton), pork skin (couennes) and white beans (haricots blancs). It may be baked with an open or a closed top. The homeland of cassoulet is the province of Languedoc, especially the towns of Toulouse, Carcassonne, and Castelnaudary. The brotherhood of Cassoulet \"La Grande Confrérie du Cassoulet de Castelnaudary\" organizes competitions and fairs about Cassoulet. == References == Category:French food",
