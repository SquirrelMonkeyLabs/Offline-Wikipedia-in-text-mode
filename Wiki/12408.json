 "text": "The iPod is a series of portable music players designed by the company Apple Inc. in California. The iPod comes with computer cables so that the user can put music from their computer onto the iPod, and play music from it using headphones. Newer iPods allow a user to play games, view pictures, watch videos and use the internet, too. The first iPod was named the iPod Classic. This iPod was released on October 23, 2001. Apple Inc. made the iPod like this until September 9, 2014. Apple made a smaller iPod called the iPod mini. It was much smaller than the iPod Classic, but did not hold as many songs. The mini still used a very small hard drive. It was replaced by a version of the iPod called the iPod nano. Another type of iPod, called the iPod shuffle, was very small, and it used flash memory, like the iPod mini but it had no screen. It was the least expensive iPod. The most expensive iPod is called the iPod touch. It has a touch screen, like the iPhone. It is very look like the iPhone, but it is not a smartphone. The first generation of iPod touch was released on September 5, 2007, it was discontinued on May 10, 2022. iPods often contain songs downloaded from an online music store, using a program called iTunes. (The name of Apple's music and video store is the iTunes Store.) Songs are sold in AAC file format, not MP3 or WMA. These are popular formats for compressing (making smaller) music until it does not take up much space and can easily be put on a media player such as the iPod. The App Store is an online shop that is run by Apple Inc. where people can buy software for their iPhone or iPod Touch. It opened on July 11, 2008. Over 2 million applications (or apps for short) are available for people to buy. Some apps are available for free. == Models == Model Generation Image Storage space Changes Connection Original release date Pricing (USD) Minimum OS to sync iPod classic first 5, 10 GB First model, with a scroll wheel that actually moved. 10 GB model made later.
