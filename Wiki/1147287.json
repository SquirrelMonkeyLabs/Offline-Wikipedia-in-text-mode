 "text": "In-Plane Switching (IPS) is a technology for liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) that aligns liquid crystal molecules parallel to the display panel to improve color and viewing angles compared to traditional TN panels. This design was developed to address the viewing angle limitations and low color quality of early LCDs in the late 1980s. == History == Initially developed for improved grayscale and viewing angles, IPS technology became viable for active matrix TFT LCDs in the 1990s, resolving limitations like grayscale inversion. Key developments were patented by Fraunhofer Society in Germany and later refined by Hitachi, which improved pixel control and reduced color shifting at different angles. Hitachi and later LG Display advanced IPS technology, creating variations such as Super IPS (S-IPS) and Advanced High-Performance IPS (AH-IPS) with enhanced color and contrast. These improvements led to the technologyâ€™s wide adoption in high-quality computer monitors, smartphones, and TV displays. IPS remains popular for devices requiring superior color accuracy and wide viewing angles, including professional monitors and high-end consumer displays. == Related pages == * Computer monitor == References == Category:Display technology",
