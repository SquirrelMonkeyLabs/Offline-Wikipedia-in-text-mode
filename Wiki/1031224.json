 "text": "The Heart of Midlothian is a mosaic. It can be found outside St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. The heart is where the entrance to Edinburgh's Old Tolbooth used to be, but it was taken down in the year 1817. In some cultures, it is believed that spitting on the heart brings good fortune. Long ago, people used to do something that they thought would bring them good luck. This tradition started because they did not like the punishments that happened in a building called the Old Tolbooth.Monuments and Statues of Edinburgh, Michael T.R.B.
