 "text": "\"This Land of Ours\" is the anthem of the Turks and Caicos Islands. ==Lyrics== I O we salute this land of ours Our country we declare This promise land with its beauties grand Though small it is our own Turks & Caicos, Turks & Caicos Our country firm and free Our allegiance Turks & Caicos We pledge and we affirm. II Our people forged and blend With multiplicity Of race and kind and creed and tongue United by our goals From the east, west, north and south Our banks and oceans meet Surrounding sands and hills of glee Our pristine beauties see III We stand with courage brave To maintain this land of ours With Islands scattered here and there With trust in God we stand ==References== Category:North American anthems Category:Turks and Caicos Islands",
