 "text": "The Thoda bush frog (Raorchestes thodai) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: 1980 meters above sea level. Scientists are not sure what kinds of places this frog lives in (forests or grassy places or rocky places). They found the frog for the first time in small pieces of forest near a town called Ooty. There were eucalyptus tree, wattle tree farms, and pine tree farms in between the pieces of forest. Scientists have seen this frog between 1863 and 2465 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes, and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists think this might be the same species of frog as Raorchestes signatus but they are not sure. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
