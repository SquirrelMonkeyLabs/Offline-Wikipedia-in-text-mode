It is located north-east of Loughborough, a university town, and is very close to the border with Nottinghamshire. Nearby villages include Barrow-upon-Soar, Prestwold, Burton on the Wolds and Rempstone. The village was formerly the location of RAF Wymeswold which has since closed. There is a memorial plaque on the wall of Wymeswold Pharmacy that pays tribute to when a Wellington Bomber crashed into a nearby hill while on a night training course. The village has a greengrocer, a general convenience store, a pine furniture store, a gift shop, a restaurant and two public houses (The Three Crowns and The Windmill). There is also a village cricket club which also includes a football pitch. ==Gallery== File:WYMESWOLD,_LEICESTERSHIRE.jpg|St Mary's Church File:The_Three_Crowns,_Wymeswold_-_geograph.org.uk_-_916744.jpg|The Three Crowns public house File:Church_Street_- _geograph.org.uk_-_1502890.jpg|Church Street Category:Villages in Leicestershire Category:Civil parishes in Leicestershire",
