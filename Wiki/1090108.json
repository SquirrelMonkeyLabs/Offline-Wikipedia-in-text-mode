The skin of the frog's back is gray or light brown in color. There are small dark brown spots on its back and sides. There are some blue spots on the sides of the body. The iris of the eye is red and yellow in color with a black circle around the outside. This frog lives in rainforests. It sits on plants next to streams, 1-3 m above the ground. People have seen the males 10 m above the ground. The female frog lays eggs in a foam nest on leaves over streams. People saw this frog in Brunei where two rivers came together and in Gunung Mulu National Park in Malaysia. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because, even though it only lives in a small place, that place is only in protected parks: Ulu Temburong National Park and Gunung Mulu National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
