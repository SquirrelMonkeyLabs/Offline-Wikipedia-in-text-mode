 "text": "Kronborg is a castle near the town of Helsingør, in the extreme north-east of Zealand, Denmark. The castle is at the narrowest point of the Øresund, the sound between Denmark and Sweden. In this part, the sound is only 4 km wide. That made it important to keep a fortress to command one of the few outlets of the Baltic Sea. The castle has for centuries been one of the most important Renaissance castles in Northern Europe. It was added to UNESCO's World Heritage Sites list on November 30, 2000. People often know Kronborg well as \"Elsinore\" since the play Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, written by William Shakespeare, is supposed to have happened there. The play was performed in the castle for the first time on the 200th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. The soldiers from the castle were some of the players. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Denmark Category:World Heritage Sites in Europe",
