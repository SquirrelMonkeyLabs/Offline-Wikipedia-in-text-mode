 "text": "The Mid-Atlantic States (also called Middle Atlantic States) is a region in the Northeastern United States and form one of the nine geographic divisions within the United States that are officially recognized by the United States Census Bureau. The states include New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The traditional Mid-Atlantic States comprise the most densely-populated of the nine U.S. regions, and serve as the center of the megalopolis which runs from Boston to Washington, D.C.. The southeastern part of New York State, eastern Pennsylvania, and all of New Jersey combine to form the bulk of the moral region of the Metropolis, according to socio-political geographers James Patterson and Peter Kim, co-authors of the 1991 book The Day America Told The Truth. (Their Metropolis begins in the southern Connecticut suburbs of New York City and stretches along the Eastern seaboard to the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.). The book classifies the remainder of New York State and Pennsylvania in the Rust Belt. == References == Category:Census Regions of the United States",
