 "text": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA or triple A) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta which is more than 50% larger than normal. They usually cause no symptoms, except during rupture. This may cause abdominal, back, or leg pain. Large aneurysms can sometimes be felt by pushing on the abdomen. Rupture may result in pain in the abdomen or back, low blood pressure, or loss of consciousness and can cause death. ==References== Category:Medical emergencies",
