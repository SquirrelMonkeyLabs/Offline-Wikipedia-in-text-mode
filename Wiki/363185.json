 "text": "The Saskatchewan River is one of the great rivers of North America. It is part of the Hudson Bay watershed. It flows in Canada east from the Rockies to Lake Winnipeg, and eventually empties into the Hudson Bay. On its journey from the Rockies, the river goes across three provinces, and covers 1,205 miles (1,939 kilometres) from its furthest point. Starting in Alberta, the river goes right through Saskatchewan and ends up in Manitoba. The river's tributaries in Manitoba and Saskatchewan are also large and important rivers. They include: *North Saskatchewan River Kostash, Myrna 2005.
