 "text": "Márianosztra (German: Naßraden) is a village in Szob District of Pest County. Its population in 2024 was 938. == Location == It lies in the south-western part of the Börzsöny. The neighbouring settlements are: Nagybörzsöny to the north, Kóspallag to the east, Szob to the south, Ipolydamásd to the southwest and Letkés to the west. The village also has an exclave a few kilometres southeast of the village centre, bordering Szokolya, Kismaros and Nagymaros to the south. == History == The name of Márianosztra was first mentioned in 1262 in a charter of King Stephen V. In 1352, according to the charter, King Louis the Great of Hungary gave land and building materials \"in nostre\" (from his own) for the establishment of a monastery and a convent in Börzsöny, and later he also gave them rich gifts. The monastery and a church were built next to it in honour of the Virgin Mary of the Hungarians. This monastery and church, the only order of male monks founded in Hungary, was built for the Paulines and remained theirs, with minor interruptions, until 1786, when the monastic orders were dissolved. In the Turkish times, the settlement was depopulated due to the ravages of a raiding Turkish army, and then repopulated with Slovak, Hungarian and German nationalities. == Population == In 2022, 90.1% of the population identified as Hungarian, 3.5% as Roma, 0.8% as German, 0.4% as Romanian, 0.3% as Slovak, 0.3% as Serbian, 0.2% as Polish, 0.2% as Bulgarian, 0.1% as Ukrainian, 0.1% as Croatian, and 2.6% as other non-local nationalities (8.9% did not respond; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%). Regarding religion, 34.3% were Roman Catholic, 4.6% Reformed, 1.7% Greek Catholic, 0.2% Lutheran, 0.2% Jewish, 0.1% Orthodox, 5.8% other Christian, 0.9% other Catholic, and 24% non-religious (27.7% did not answer).Márianosztra ==References== Category:Villages in Hungary Category:Pest County",
