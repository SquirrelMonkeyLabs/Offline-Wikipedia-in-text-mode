 "text": "The Kingdom of Scotland was a historic country and state. It started in the Early Middle Ages and was in existence until the early modern period. After 1603, it had the same monarch as the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Ireland. In 1653, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the government of Oliver Cromwell made Scotland into part of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland: a republic. However, at The Restoration, Scotland started again to be a kingdom. It combined with the Kingdom of England to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 because of the Acts of Union 1707. == References == ==Related pages== *Scotland *Parliament of Scotland Category:Former monarchies of Europe Category:History of Scotland",
