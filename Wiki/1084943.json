 "text": "The Wieprz is a river in central-eastern Poland, and a tributary of the Vistula. It is the country's ninth longest river, with a total length of 349 km and a catchment area of 10,497 km2, all within Poland.Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Poland 2017, Statistics Poland, p. 85-86 Its course near the town of Łęczna includes the protected area known as Wieprz Landscape Park. The river has its source in Lake Wieprz, in Wieprzów Tarnawacki near Tomaszów Lubelski, and flows into the Vistula near Dęblin. The Wieprz is connected to another river, the Krzna, through the 140-kilometer Wieprz-Krzna Canal, built in 1954-1961. Because the Wieprz with its wide valley has not been regulated, its nature is very diverse. The meandering river with its oxbow lakes is inhabited by numerous birds, European otters and Eurasian beavers. ==References== Category:Rivers of Poland Category:Lublin Voivodeship",
