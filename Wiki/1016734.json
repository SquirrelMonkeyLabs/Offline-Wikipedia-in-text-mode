 "text": "Deadpan comedy (also known as dry humor or deadpan humor) is a style of comedy where jokes or absurd stories are delivered emotionlessly. Because this emotionless (\"deadpan\") delivery differs so much from the humor and absurdity of the comment, there is a unique comedic effect. This effect often catches the audience off guard, heightening the comedy of the situation. == Origins == Deadpan comedy has roots in vaudeville and the silent film era, where comedians like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin mastered the art of deadpan delivery. However, it became more popular in the mid-20th century with comedians like Jack Benny and Bob Newhart, who used deadpan comedy as a key part of their acts. Quickly, deadpan humor gained popularity among audiences. == Characteristics == === Delivery === One of the key characteristics of deadpan comedy is the delivery. Comedians who employ this style maintain an expressionless demeanor while delivering jokes or performing absurd actions. They do not laugh or smile, and often use deadpan pauses and minimal gestures to enhance the comedic effect. This contrast between the serious delivery and the humorous content creates a sense of irony and surprise, eliciting laughter from the audience. === Timing === Deadpan comedy relies heavily on timing and subtlety. Comedians use precise pauses and deadpan reactions to build anticipation and deliver punchlines with maximum impact. The success of the joke depends on the perfect balance between the delivery and the content. Too much emotion or exaggeration can ruin the deadpan effect, while too little can make the humor go unnoticed. === Versatility === One of the strengths of deadpan comedy is its versatility. It can be used in a wide range of comedic situations, from one-line jokes and observational humor to satire. Deadpan comedy often plays with the expectations of the audience, subverting traditional comedic tropes and challenging societal norms. It can be used to highlight the absurdity of everyday situations or to make social and political commentary in a subtle and thought-provoking manner. == Impact == Deadpan comedy has had a significant impact on the comedy landscape. It has influenced numerous comedians and comedic actors who have adopted the deadpan style in their performances. Comedians like Steven Wright, Mitch Hedberg, and Demetri Martin have achieved great success with their deadpan delivery, using it as a unique selling point in their acts. Television shows like \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation\" have also popularized deadpan humor, with characters delivering lines with a straight face and deadpan delivery, often leading to hilariously awkward situations. Deadpan comedy is not specific to any particular culture. Comedians from different countries have embraced this style and adapted it to their own comedic traditions. Category:Humor",
