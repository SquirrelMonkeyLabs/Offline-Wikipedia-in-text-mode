 "text": "Ales Viktaravich Bialiatski (; born 25 September 1962) is a Belarusian pro- democracy activist and prisoner of conscience. He is known for his work with the Viasna Human Rights Centre. He is a well known activist for Belarusian independence and democracy since the early 1980s. Bialiatski is a founding member of Viasna and the Belarusian Popular Front. He is also a member of the Coordination Council of the Belarusian opposition. In 2022, Bialiatski was awarded the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, along with the organisations Memorial and Centre for Civil Liberties. Bialiatski has been in prison twice. The first time was from 2011 to 2014. His second time has been since 2021 because of charges of tax evasion, but many see his arrest as politically motivated. On 3 March 2023, a Belarusian court sentenced Bialiatski to prison for 10 years. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Belarusian politicians Category:Human rights activists Category:People from Karelia",
