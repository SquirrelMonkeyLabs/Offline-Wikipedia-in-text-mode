 "text": "Two-spirit is a term used by some Native Americans who have a gender that is more than just man or woman, fulfilling a non-binary or third sex role. The term was first created in 1990 at the Third Annual Inter-tribal Native American, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian American Conference, so it could be used instead of berdache, which was seen as derogatory. It is an umbrella term, including all Native third sex roles, and so has been criticized for erasing the unique roles of individual Native peoples. == References == Category:Non-binary gender Category:Native Americans",
