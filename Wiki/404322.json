 "text": "Anterograde amnesia is a kind of amnesia. Amnesia is a problem with remembering things. In anterograde amnesia, people have trouble making memories last - they forget. Amnesia is triggered by an event; people with anterograde amnesia have problems creating new memories after that event. With anterograde amnesia, the longer-term memories from the time before the event remain intact. The amnesia may be partial or complete. Very often Anterograde amnesia occurs together with retrograde amnesia. This is the case with conditions such as concussion.
