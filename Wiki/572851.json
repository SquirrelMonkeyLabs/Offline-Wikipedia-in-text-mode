She was the plaintiff in the landmark American lawsuit Roe v. Wade in 1973. The US Supreme Court ruled that individual state laws banning abortion are unconstitutional. Later, McCorvey said that her views on abortion had greatly changed, and she became a Catholic activist in the pro-life movement. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:American activists Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Writers from Louisiana Category:Writers from Texas",
