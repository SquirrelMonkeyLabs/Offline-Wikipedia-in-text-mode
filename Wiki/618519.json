 "text": "The Ford Country Squire was a station wagon from Ford Motor Company. It was first made in 1950. The car got started as a \"woodie\", a car with wood material making up part of the car. But by 1952, the Country Squire was no longer a true woodie. However, all Country Squires were made with steel and wood. From the 1960s to the early 1980s, many variations of the Squire name were used on wood-grained cars, like the LTD II, Falcon, Escort and the mid- sized LTD. During the mid-1980s, sales of full-size station wagons began to go down. This was after the Chrysler and Ford Aerostar minivans began being made. At Ford, the role for the 8-passenger station wagon was given to Mercury Sable and Ford Taurus in 1992.
