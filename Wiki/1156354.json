 "text": "Poland-Ukraine border is the line that borders the countries of Poland and Ukraine, which was already the border between the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Ukraine. == History == The border between Poland and Ukraine was first formed, briefly, after the Polish-Ukrainian war of 1919. The 1920 Treaty of Warsaw divided the disputed territories in favor of Poland along the Zbruch River. The following year, however, Ukraine lost its independence following its annexation to the Soviet Union, and its remaining territories were divided between Poland and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Peace of Riga. The dissolution of the Soviet Union into several states transformed the border between this federation and Poland into the Poland-Russia, Poland- Lithuania, Poland-Belarus and Poland-Ukraine border chain. Poland and Ukraine confirmed their border on May 18, 1992. It is the longest eastern border in Poland. The border became much more open compared to Soviet times, when despite both countries being part of the Eastern Bloc, crossing was very difficult. As the border opened to mass trafficking, the number of people crossing the Polish-Ukrainian border began to increase steadily since 1990, stabilizing around the 2000s. Approximately 3 million Ukrainians crossed the border annually in the 1990s. One of highest numbers was recorded in 2001, with nearly 12 million people crossing the border. Examining Polish-Ukrainian border traffic in the 1990s, it is observed that the movement of citizens from Ukraine to Poland is higher than vice versa, and that this trend increases over time. For example, in 1995, the largest border crossing with Ukraine, Medyce, exceeded 3.4 million people in transit.Anna Rogowska, Stanisław Stępień: Granica polsko-ukraińska w ostatnim polvołwieczu (1997)Eastern Borders Annual Risk Analysis 2013, FRONTEX == Related pages == * External borders of the European Union and the Schengen area == References == Category:Borders of Ukraine Category:Borders of Poland Category:Articles with excerpts Category:Poland–Ukraine border",
