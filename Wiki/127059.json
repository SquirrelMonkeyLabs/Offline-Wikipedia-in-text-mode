Nevermind helped to make both grunge music and alternative rock popular. It has been known as one of the greatest albums of all time. ==Background== Nirvana was a rock band from Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain (vocals and guitar) and Krist Novoselic (bass guitar) in 1987. They first signed to the Seattle record label Sub Pop. The band released their first album on this label called Bleach in 1989 with Chad Channing on drums. Channing left Nirvana after this album in 1990, and the band needed a drummer. After seeing punk band Scream, Cobain and Novoselic liked the drumming by Dave Grohl. When Scream broke up after this, Grohl joined Nirvana as the drummer. During the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was having a difficult time with money. Because of this, Nirvana looked for a new record label. They ended up signing with DGC RecordsClassic Albumsâ€”Nirvana: Nevermind [DVD]. Isis Productions, 2004. ==Title and cover== The first name for the album before its release was Sheep. This came from the kind of people Cobain thought were going to buy the album (sheep is a word meaning someone who does what other people do). The title was later changed to Nevermind as it was what Cobain thought about bad things in his life.Cross 2001, p. 189 The album cover of Nevermind shows a naked baby (Spencer Elden) swimming underwater with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook. This is just out of the baby's reach. Cobain wanted to have a photo of a water birth on the cover but the record label wouldn't let him. == Track listing == ==References== Category:Nirvana (band) albums Category:1991 albums",
