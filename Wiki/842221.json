 "text": "The 2012–13 North American drought was caused by less than normal snowfall the previous winter. Also, La Niña-related heat waves were taking place in the Midwestern and Western United States. This was in association with drought conditions in these areas. The drought was an extension of the 2010-13 Southern United States drought. The drought was worse than the 1988–89 North American drought. The 2012-13 drought covered more areas in the United States and Canada than the 1988-89 drought. In July 2012, the drought covered more than 81% in area. It was comparable to the droughts of the 1930s and 1950s. Drought continued in parts of North America through 2013. Beginning in March 2013, rainfall lessened drought in the Midwest, the southern Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains. ==References== Category:Droughts Category:2012 in North America Category:2013 in the United States",
