 "text": "Thrymr or Saturn XXX, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000 S 7\\. Thrymr is about 5.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 20,810,000 km in 1120.809 days, at an inclination of 175° to the ecliptic (151° to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.453. Thrymr may have formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe at some point in the past. Its name comes from Norse mythology, where Thrymr is a Jotun or frost giant. The name was said as Thrym in IAU Circular 8177. However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative case ending -r to the root Thrym. == References == * IAUC 7538: S/2000 S 7, S/2000 S 8, S/2000 S 9 2000 December 7 (discovery) * MPEC 2000-Y15: S/2000 S 1, S/2000 S 2, S/2000 S 7, S/2000 S 8, S/2000 S 9 2000 December 19 (discovery and ephemeris) * IAUC 8177: Satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus 2003 August 8 (naming the moon Thrym) * IAUC 8471: Satellites of Saturn 2005 January 21 (correcting the name) Category:Saturn's moons",
