 "text": "Bhakti yoga is a Hindu spiritual practice. People constantly pray to, and think about, a form of a Hindu god, usually Vishnu. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term. It signifies an attitude of devotion to God. The relation between man and God is imagined as a beloved-lover, friend-friend, parent-child, and master- servant. The Bhakta worships his chosen God by any of these mentalities. The Bhagavata Purana teaches nine primary forms of bhakti. They are: * śravaṇa (\"listening\" to the scriptural stories of and his companions) * kīrtana (\"praising,\" usually refers to ecstatic group singing) * smaraṇa (\"remembering\" or fixing the mind on Viṣṇu) * pāda-sevana (giving service) * arcana (worshiping an image) * vandana (paying homage) * dāsya (behaving like a servant) * sākhya (friendship) * ātma-nivedana (complete surrender of the self) Category:Hinduism",
