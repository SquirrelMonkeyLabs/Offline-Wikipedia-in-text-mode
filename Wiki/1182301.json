 "text": "Alice Field Ginott Cohn was the founder of Alice Field Cohn Chair in Yiddish Studies at Indiana University and a participant in one of Alfred Kinsey’s studies about women. Born in 1925, Cohn was a refugee from Czechoslokavia who immigrated to the United States during the Great Depression with not much money and little knowledge of English. She attended Indiana University and majored in psychology after learning English and getting a full scholarship to attend. While a sophomore there, Cohn was interviewed by Alfred Kinsey about her sexual life. She and thousands of women’s interviews were the basis of Kinsey’s educational yet very controversial book Sexual Behavior in the Human Female. She was also elected president of a student organization that helped include Black students in campus life. She went on to acquire a doctorate in psychology at the New School for Social Research in New York, then trained as a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst, and finally founded a psychotherapy practice. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2025",
