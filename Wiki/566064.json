 "text": "In the battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon Bonaparte fought Russian and Austrian troops. The battle took place near Austerlitz (now in the Czech Republic) in 1805. Napoleonâ€™s big victory let him create the Confederation of the Rhine. The book War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy contains a detailed description of the battle. The battle sometimes (as of the 2020s) gets acted out (or reenacted).https://www.nrk.no/urix/kva-kan-vi-eigentleg-laere-av- napoleon_-1.16682825.
