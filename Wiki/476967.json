 "text": "AT&T; Corporation, commonly referred to as AT&T;, an abbreviation for its former name, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, was an American telecommunications company that provided voice, video, data, and Internet telecommunications and professional services to businesses, consumers, and government agencies. == History == The company was formed in 1885 as American Telephone and Telegraph. In 1900 the company introduced the Bell System. The company quickly gained a monopoly on the phone industry. The government was going to investigate, but World War 2 started, so they were distracted. In 1964 the name of American Telephone and Telegraph was changed to AT&T; Corporation. In 1983 the company was forced to spin-off the Bell System into seven new companies. One of the new companies was SBC Communications. SBC united a majority of the companies until 2005, when they bought AT&T; itself (they would take the name of the company.) Another company (Bell Atlantic) would form Verizon.
