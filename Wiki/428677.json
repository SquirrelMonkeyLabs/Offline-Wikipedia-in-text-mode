 "text": "Evolution is a professional wrestling stable that competes in the WWE. The stable was created on January 20, 2003 and broke up on October 3, 2005. The members of the stable were Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista and Ric Flair. Triple H acted as the leader and Flair acted as a mentor. The members of the stable each portrayed evolutions of professional wrestling with Ric Flair being \"the past\", Triple H being \"the present\" and Randy Orton and Batista being \"the future\". They all portrayed heels. On April 14, 2014, Evolution, not including Ric Flair, reunited. They came down to the ring to their theme \"Line in the Sand\" by Motörhead and attacked The Shield. On the June 2 episode of Raw, Batista quit the WWE after he had his title match request denied by Triple H. Later in the night, Triple H said that he had a \"Plan B\" in his quest to destroy the Shield, which prompted Rollins to turn on and attack his group members Reigns and Ambrose. On October 16, 2018, during the 1000th episode of WWE SmackDown, Evolution reunited for one night. During the reunion, Batista was praising Triple H and saying that he has beaten everybody in the company before revealing that he hasn't beaten him. Batista would return on the February 25, 2019 episode of Raw and beat up Ric Flair backstage to try and get a match against Triple H. Triple H defeated Batista at WrestleMania 35 and Batista retired afterwards. == In wrestling == * Entrance themes **\"Evolve\" by Jim Johnston (February 10, 2003–June 16, 2003) **\"Line in the Sand\" by Motörhead (July 14, 2003–November 14, 2004; April 14, 2014–2018) * Championships **World Heavyweight Championship (five times) (Triple H (four) and Orton (one)) **World Tag Team Championship (two times) (Flair and Batista (two)) **WWE Intercontinental Championship (2 times) (Orton (one) and Flair (one)) **Royal Rumble (2005) (Batista) ==References== == Other websites == *Triple H's WWE profile *Ric Flair's WWE profile *Randy Orton's WWE profile *Batista's WWE profile Category:WWE teams and stables",
