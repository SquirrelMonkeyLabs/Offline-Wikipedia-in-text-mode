 "text": "The Bouddi National Park is a national park in New South Wales, 44 kilometres northeast of Sydney on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. It is near Broken Bay, the mouth of the Hawkesbury River. Part of this national park also includes the adjacent coastal waters, so that a contiguous habitat on land, on the coast and in the sea is protected. The park also includes Fletchers Glen, one of the last remaining temperate rainforests on the central stretch of the New South Wales coast. Originally the park was called Bouddi Natural Park. It got its name at the second Park Association meeting in 1936. Other names that were under discussion were Maitland Bay Park, Cape Three Points Reserve, and Gerrinbombi Park . The reason for the choice of the name was the fact that Bouddi was documented as an Aboriginal name for this area, since it appeared in maps from 1828.F. C.

S. 17 The park association was formed the year before to administer the park and had members from the NSW Federation of Bushwalking Clubs and the Erina Shire Council. In 1967 the then 530 hectare park was rededicated as a national park and renamed Bouddi State Park, according to the legislation that had just come into force. Management passed to the NSW National Park and Wildlife Service and shortly thereafter the parks association was transformed into an advisory committee. On the 1st January 1974 the National Park and Wildlife Act dropped the State Park category and the park was renamed Bouddi National Park.Eileen Pratt: Place Names of the Central Coast.
