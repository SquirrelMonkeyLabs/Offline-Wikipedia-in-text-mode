 "text": "21st Century Fox (Twenty-First Century Fox) was an American multinational mass media corporation founded in 2013. In 2019, Disney acquired most of 21CF. It is one of two companies made from the 2013 split of News Corporation (founded by Rupert Murdoch in 1979). 21st Century Fox has the broadcasting and movie assets and serves as the legal successor to News Corporation. The publishing assets were spun off to form News Corp at the same time. The split was so both companies operate under more \"focused\" management, which Murdoch claimed would \"unlock\" their true value. Among the holdings of 21st Century Fox are Fox Entertainment Group. This owns the 20th Century Fox film studio and Fox television network. There are other assets, such as the pan-Asian pay channel operator Star India. On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company said that they would acquire a lot of 21st Century Fox's subsidiaries for $52 billion USD. This includes the 20th Century Fox studio and Fox's partnership with National Geographic. Some subsidiaries like Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox News Channel will still be a part of 21st Century Fox. The deal closed on March 20, 2019. ==Final holdings== 21st Century Fox primarily consisted of the media and broadcasting properties that were owned by its predecessor, such as the Fox Entertainment Group and Star India. News Corporation's broadcasting properties in Australia, such as Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, remain a part of the newly renamed News Corp Australia—which was spun off with the current incarnation of News Corp and was not a part of 21st Century Fox. ===Music and radio=== * Fox Music * Fox News Radio * Fox News Talk * Fox Sports Radio ===Studios=== * Fox Entertainment Group: 20th Century Fox's parent company * 20th Century Fox: a film production/distribution company * Fox Searchlight Pictures – specialised films. * Fox 2000 Pictures – general audience feature films. * Fox Studios Australia, Sydney, New South Wales * Fox Family - a family friendly production company * Fox Stage Productions - a theatrical production company * 20th Century Fox Television – primetime television programming. * 20th Television – television distribution (syndication). * Lincolnwood Drive Inc. * Fox 21 Television Studios – low scripted/budgeted television production company. * Fox Television Animation - animation production company. * Fox Television Studios- market specific programming e.g. and network television company. * 20th Century Fox Animation - animation production company. * Blue Sky Studios – production of computer animated films * 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment - home video distribution company * Boom!
