 "text": "The IRIS Shahid Bagheri is a drone carrier operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy. She is the result of the 2022–2024 conversion of the container ship Perarin, to which was added an angled flightdeck with a ski-jump, in the manner of light aircraft carriers. She is named after Shahid (martyr) Bahman Bagheri, an IRGC commander who died in Pathak, Iraq, in a clash of the Iran–Iraq war. The ship is the first full-service UAV carrier of the IRGC Navy. She was launched at sea for the first sea trials from her home port of Bandar Abbas sometime around 28 November 2024. Her launch underscored Tehran's efforts to project its power overseas, far beyond nearby waters. She was commissioned on 6 February 2025. ==References== Category:Warships Category:Military of Iran",
