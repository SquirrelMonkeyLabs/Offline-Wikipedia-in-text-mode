She was internationaly a leading female fencer in the early 1910s. Martin Edmunds became British national champion in 1909. She won in the summer of 1913 the international women's fencing tournament at the 1913 International Exposition in Ghent. Forty fencers competed at this tournament and she among others eliminated the Dutch Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo. In 1914 she won the 1914 Salle Giandomenici international women's fencing competition in Amsterdam. Of the eight matches she only lost one match. With less received touch√©s compared to Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo who also lost only one match, she won the tournament. Martin Edmunds was tall compared to Dutch and Belgian fencers. This was in her advantage having a larger reach. She had, as described, a \"careful\" fencing style. ==References== ==Other websites== *Image - participants of the international tournament in Amsterdam in 1914 Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:British fencers Category:1872 births Category:1947 deaths",
