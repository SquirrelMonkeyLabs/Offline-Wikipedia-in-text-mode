Some authors, such as Peter Paul Wiplinger, have already published several books with Arovell, but others use Arovell to publish their first book(s). Arovell publishes modern literature in the German language. They include short prose, stories and poetry. The covers of all books show a painting by Paul Jaeg. Arovell also publishes a magazine about literature, music and art, which gives information about new books and public events. The magazine prints sometimes short texts from the books by Arovell.
