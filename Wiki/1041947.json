 "text": "The New Zealand women's national football team, which FIFA calls Aotearoa New Zealand and is looked after by New Zealand Football (NZF). The New Zealand national team has played in the FIFA Women's World Cup six times. They first played in the world cup for the first time in 1991. In 2023, New Zealand and Australia together hosted the World Cup. However, they have never gone further than the group stage in any of the tournaments. == History == In 1975, the New Zealand Women's Soccer Association was started. They were asked to join the Asian Women's Championship that year and they won. After that, they played in the Oceanic Championship. When Australia left the OFC, New Zealand didn't have strong competitors in Oceania. This made it easier for New Zealand to qualify for the World Cup and Olympics. They've been in every edition of both tournaments since 2007. === 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup === In 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, New Zealand co-hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup with Australia. They were given the opportunity on 25 June 2020 because they were more likely to win than the other candidate, Colombia. The Football Ferns got to be in the tournament automatically as co-hosts. They won their first match against Norway, but surprisingly lost to newcomers Philippines. Later, they tied with Switzerland in their final match and were knocked out. This was the first time the hosts were knocked out in the group stage. They only managed to score one goal during the tournament. == References == Category:National sports teams of New Zealand Category:Oceanian women's national football teams Category:Football in New Zealand",
