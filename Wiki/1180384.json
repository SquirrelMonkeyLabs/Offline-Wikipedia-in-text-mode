 "text": "The Battle of Brémule was on 20 August 1119. It was between Henry I of England and Louis VI the Fat of France. Henry I had to defend Normandy many times. His victory stopped an invasion from France. The French loss stopped the rebellion. It led to King Louis accepting William Adelin as Duke of Normandy. William Adelin became the Duke in 1120, even though King Louis still thought William Clito was the duke. England and France did not agree with the borders of both kingdoms. Both were lawkeeping in this area. This issue led to the battle. French stores said the battle was bloody and fierce. French stories said that Louis the Fat fought so close to the knights that a Norman said \"The King is taken!\" The king then replied \"The King is not taken, neither at war, nor at chess!\" This statement was proven later to not be said by the king.Rozan, Charles (1888), Petites ignorances historiques et littéraires, pp. 4–5. British and Norman stories said that their knights gained lots of money from the ransoms paid by the prisoners. They also said that the British only had 3 casualties.Orderic Vitalis, Historia Ecclesiastica VI 240–241. Cfr. Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 1119. ==References== ==Other websites== *Orderic Vitalis, \"Battle of Brémule, according to Orderic Vitalis\", from De Re Militari: The Society for Medieval Military History, online.
