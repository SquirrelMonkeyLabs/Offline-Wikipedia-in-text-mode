It was published in Vienna, Austria in 1799. The work is written in three movements. The first opens with a slow and serious introduction. It is followed by an quick section in sonata form. This section is driven forward by tremolando octaves in the left hand. The movement expresses a questing, uncertain mood. The second movement is a slow piece in rondo form. The third movement is a quick, melancholic rondo. Its main theme is accompanied by arpeggios in the left hand. This movement concludes with a brilliant coda. ==References== * Woodstra, Chris, et. al. 2005. All Music Guide to Classical Music. All Media Guide, LLC. p. 108\\. . Piano Sonata 008",
