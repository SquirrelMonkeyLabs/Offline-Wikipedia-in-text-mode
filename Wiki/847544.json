 "text": "The Dendropsophus kubricki is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have seen it between 106 and 725 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 22.73 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog about 28.39 mm. There is a bright orange spot under each of the four legs. The skin of the frog's back is brown, red-brown, or gray-brown in color with some darker brown marks. The underside is black in color and some frogs have white spots. The iris of the eye is red-brown, brown, or silver-gray in color. This frog lives in the Amazon Basin. People have seen it in rainforests and flooded rainforests. The female frog lays her eggs in bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Humans may bother this frog by changing the forests where it lives to raise cows and look for oil. Scientists named this frog after filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
