 "text": "\"D.S.\" is a song by Michael Jackson, featured on his 1995 album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The track is known for its catchy beat and the controversy surrounding its lyrics, which were perceived by many as a commentary on the media and certain individuals' treatment of the artist. The song's title is often interpreted as a reference to the name of a high-profile individual, and the track reflects themes of harassment and the complexities of fame. It was written, composed and produced by Jackson and includes an instrumental accompaniment and guitar solo by Slash. The song is a diss track; the lyrics are interpreted as an attack on Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon, whose name is similar to the subject of the song, Dom Sheldon. Sneddon controlled the investigation into Jackson following the 1993 accusations of child sexual abuse against him. Jackson was angered by the allegations, his perception of the frequent mistreatment of people of color by the police and media, and the negative effect on his health.
