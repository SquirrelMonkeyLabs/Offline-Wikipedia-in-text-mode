 "text": "BRICS Culture Media Forum (BCMF) is an international initiative under the BRICS Plus framework that seeks to foster intercultural dialogue, media cooperation, and peace-building through creative diplomacy. It brings together artists, media professionals, policy leaders, and entrepreneurs to collaborate on global challenges through cultural narratives, media platforms, and people- to-people contact. BCMF aims to position soft power and cultural integration at the heart of international relations among BRICS and BRICS Plus countries. == History == The concept of the BRICS Culture Media Forum was envisioned in 2022 by BRICS Plus Countries Leadership and cultural entrepreneur and philanthropist Dr. Jaan Nissar Lone was announced as Global President. Following growing global interest in using culture and communication as tools for peace, BCMF was founded to promote unity through shared heritage and inclusive innovation across BRICS nations. Its mission was shaped during global disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability, where cultural solidarity proved to be a healing force. BCMF gained strategic recognition during the 15th BRICS Summit held in Johannesburg in August 2023, which emphasized multilateralism and South-South cooperation. The forum's themes aligned with the BRICS vision of establishing a balanced global order by amplifying voices from the Global South. This recognition led to its integration within the cultural roadmap of BRICS Plus, supported by governmental and non-governmental bodies alike. In 2024, under Russia's chairmanship of BRICS, BCMF expanded its reach and scope, becoming a key participant in over 200 events across Russian cities. It collaborated with cultural institutions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Grozny, contributing to the BRICS theme: “Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security.” This period marked a turning point, establishing BCMF as a long-term diplomatic and cultural platform across multiple continents. == Team == Name Position Role / Responsibility Dr. Jaan Nissar Lone Global President Oversees all BCMF activities and global outreach; strategic leadership.
