 "text": "Blur is an English alternative rock band. Formed in London in 1988 originally under the name Seymour, the group's members are singer Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Blur's first album Leisure (1991) contained the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. After a change in sound started by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). As a result, the band helped the Britpop genre become popular and became popular in the UK, which was helped by a rivalry with Oasis in 1995 called \"The Battle of Britpop\". ==Discography== *Leisure (1991) *Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) *Parklife (1994) *The Great Escape (1995) *Blur (1997) *13 (1999) *Think Tank (2003) *The Magic Whip (2015) *The Ballad of Darren (2023) Category:1988 establishments in England Category:1980s British music groups Category:1990s British music groups Category:2000s British music groups Category:2010s British music groups Category:Alternative rock bands Category:English rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1988 Category:Musical groups from Essex Category:Warner Bros.
