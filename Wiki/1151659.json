 "text": "The history of Australia since 1945 has seen long periods of economic prosperity and the introduction of an expanded and multi-ethnic immigration program, which has coincided with moves away from Britain in political, social and cultural terms and towards increasing engagement with the United States and Asia. == Post-World War II rebuilding == After World War II, Australia focused on rebuilding and growing its economy. Projects like the Snowy Mountains Scheme (1949–1974) created jobs and supported immigration. Australia adopted a multicultural immigration policy, welcoming millions of people from Europe and later Asia and the Middle East, shaping modern society. == The Cold War era == During the Cold War, Australia aligned closely with the United States, joining conflicts like the Korean War and the Vietnam War to counter communism. Domestically, fears of communism led to attempts to ban the Communist Party of Australia in the 1950s. == Social and economic changes == The 1950s and 1960s brought economic prosperity and cultural shifts. Television and rock and roll music became popular, and Australia hosted the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In 1967, a referendum allowed Aboriginal Australians to be counted in the census, marking a step toward addressing Indigenous rights. == End of White Australia Policy == By the 1970s, the White Australia Policy ended, and immigration became more inclusive, welcoming people from across the world. This led to Australia becoming a more multicultural nation. == Recent history == Since the 1980s, Australia has strengthened ties with Asia and the Pacific while maintaining its alliance with the U.S. The economy has grown steadily, thanks to industries like mining and technology. Social progress continues, including recognizing Aboriginal land rights and same-sex marriage legalization in 2017.
