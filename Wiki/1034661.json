 "text": "The glandular bush frog, Noble's bubble-nest frog, Noble's bush frog, southern bubble-nest frog, rough-skinned bush frog, Manatoddy bubble-nest frog, beautiful bush frog, or pretty bush frog (Raorchestes glandulosus) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. Scientists have seen it between 400 and 2000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees and moves around at night. It lives in the shorter trees in forests. People have seen it about 4 m above the ground. People have also seen it in coffee farms, tea farms, and acacia farms. The female frog lays eggs on leaves. The eggs hatch into small frogs. These animals never swim as tadpoles. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying out. Human beings cut down its forests to make large farms, and the chemicals meant to kill pests can kill the frog too. Scientists also think climate change could kill this frog. It could make the frog's home too dry. Also, because the frog lives high in the mountains, it cannot move north if the forest gets too hot. The lower areas between mountains would already be even hotter. Scientists have seen other frogs in Raorchestes sick from the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, but they do not know for sure whether that fungus can kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
