 "text": "85 Io is a big, dark Main belt asteroid of the C spectral class. It is probably a primitive body made of carbonates. Like 70 Panopaea it orbits within the Eunomia asteroid family but it is not related to the shattered parent body. Io is a retrograde rotator, with its pole pointing towards one of ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-45°, 105°) or (-15°, 295°) with a 10° uncertainty[1]. This gives an axial tilt of about 125° or 115°, respectively. Its shape is quite spherical. It was found by C. H. F. Peters on September 19, 1865 and named after Io, a lover of Zeus in Greek mythology. A diameter of 178 kilometres was measured from an occultation of a star on December 10, 1995 [4]. Io is also the name of the volcanic moon of Jupiter. With a two-digit number and a two-letter name, 85 Io has the shortest designation of all minor planets. == Other websites == * shape model deduced from lightcurve == References == # J. Torppa et al.
