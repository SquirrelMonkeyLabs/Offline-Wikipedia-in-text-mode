In Roman times, the Roman limes passed through the settlement. In 430, the Huns invaded the entire Pannonia province. The Huns later used the camps of the Romans as fortifications, including Cirpi. Bogdány was a significant royal city in the XIV-XV. century; even the duty was exempted. The Turkish conquests did not spare Dunabogdány either: after the occupation of the Visegrád castle, the village fell into Turkish hands. The castle was abandoned by the Turks in 1686. In 1725, Danube Swabians were settled in the village, which tripled the population of the village. == Landmarks == * Church of Donatus of Arezzo * Millenium Memorial * Roman Catholic Church * Reformed Church * Statue of John of Nepomuk * Swabian deportation monument Category:Villages in Hungary Category:Pest County",
