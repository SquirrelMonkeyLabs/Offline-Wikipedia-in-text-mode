He is very important to modern dance. He is called the \"founding father of expressionist dance\", He helped create Laban movement analysis and Labanotation (a movement notation system, or way of writing down movement). These helped other changes in dance notation and movement analysis. He helped in dance therapy. He also helped in theatrical movement. He tried to put his ideas in other fields, like architecture, education, industry, and management. When he was preparing for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, the Nazi party targeted Laban. He went to England in 1937. In 1945 and 1946, he and Lisa Ullmann started the Laban Art of Movement Guild in London, and The Art of Movement Studio in Manchester. ==Works and publications== * (Undated).
