It was awarded for \"the most important scientific discovery or for the greatest contribution made by experiment\". The Copley Medal is the world's oldest scientific prize and it was awarded 170 years before the first Nobel Prize.Royal Society Copley Medal | Royal Society Notable winners include James Cook, Benjamin Franklin, William Herschel, John Hunter, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, Dmitri Mendeleev, Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Francis Crick. Recent winners have been: * Andrew Wiles KBE FRS was awarded the Copley Medal in 2017 for his \"beautiful and unexpected proof of Fermat's Last Theorem which is one of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century\". * Richard Henderson FMedSci FRS was awarded the Copley Medal in 2016 in recognition of his fundamental and revolutionary contributions to the electron microscopy of biological materials. It enabled their atomic structure to be deduced. * Peter Higgs CH FRS was awarded the Copley Medal 2015 for his fundamental contribution to particle physics with his theory explaining the origin of mass in elementary particles. This was confirmed by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. == Medal recipients == Year Image Name Rationale Notes 1731 \"For his new Electrical Experiments: – as an encouragement to him for the readiness he has always shown in obliging the Society with his discoveries and improvements in this part of Natural Knowledge\" 1732 \"For the Experiments he made for the year 1732\" 1733 No Award — — 1734 \"In consideration of his several Experiments performed before the Society\" 1735 No Award — — 1736 \"For his experiments made during the year\" 1737 \"For his Experiment to show the property of a Diet of Madder Root in dyeing the Bones of living animals of a red colour\" 1738 \"For his invention of an Engine for driving the Piles to make a Foundation for the Bridge to be erected at Westminster, the Model whereof had been shown to the Society\" — 1739 \"For his Experiments towards the Discovery of Medicines for dissolving the Stone; and Preservatives for keeping Meat in long voyages at Sea\" 1740 \"For his Lectures on Muscular Motion.

fundamental contribution to the theory of crystal morphology, in particular to the source of dislocations and their consequences in interfaces and crystal growth; to fundamental understanding of liquid crystals and the concept of disclination; and to the extension of crystallinity concepts to aperiodic crystals. He has also contributed through a variety of remarkable insights into a great number of physical problems\" — 1995 \"In recognition of his contribution to animal virology with special emphasis on the pox and myxomatosis viruses and their relationship with the host in causing disease\" — 1996 \"In recognition of his contribution to the understanding of mechanical properties of materials and related topics through his pioneering studies on crystal plasticity, dislocation impurity interactions, fracture and irradiation effects\" 1997 \"In recognition of his pioneering work on the structure of muscle and on the molecular mechanisms of muscle contraction, providing solutions to one of the great problems in physiology\" — 1998 \"In recognition of his profound contributions to many fields within fluid mechanics including important aspects of the interaction of sound and fluid flow and numerous other contributions which have had practical applications in aircraft engine design. He is noted also for his ground-breaking work on both external bio-fluid- dynamics – analysis of mechanisms of swimming and flying – and internal bio- fluid-dynamics, including flow in the cardiovascular system and the airways, and cochlear mechanics and other aspects of hearing\" 1999 \"In recognition of his seminal contributions to evolutionary biology, including his experimental work on sexual selection, his important contributions to our understanding of ageing, his introduction of game theoretical methods for the analysis of complex evolutionary scenarios and his research into molecular evolution, both through his classic work on genetic hitchhiking, and with his more recent, ongoing work on bacterial population growth\" 2000 \"In recognition of his pioneering work in elucidating the detailed biosynthetic pathways to all the major families of plant alkaloids. His approach, which stands as a paradigm for future biosynthetic studies on complex molecules, combines isolation work, structure determination, synthesis, isotopic labelling and spectroscopy, especially advanced NMR, as well as genetics and molecular biology. This spectacular research revealed the entire pathway to vitamin B12\" — 2001 \"For his work on the immunological function of the thymus and of T cells, which has revolutionised the science of immunology. Professor Millers work is paving the way for designing new methods to improve resistance to infections, producing new vaccines, enhancing graft survival, dealing with autoimmunity and even persuading the immune system to reject cancer cells\" — 2002 \"For his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry. His work transformed density functional theory into a powerful theoretical tool for chemistry, chemical physics and biology\" 2003 \"For his unique range of groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of cell and developmental biology. He pioneered the concept that specialised cells are genetically equivalent and that they differ only in the genes they express not the genes they contain, a concept fundamental to modern biology\" — 2004 \"in recognition of his seminal contributions to understanding the fundamental dynamics of carbon chain molecules, leading to the detection of these species (polyynes) in the interstellar medium by radioastronomy, and thence to the genesis of a new era in carbon science\" 2005 \"for his contributions to cell biology in general, and to the elucidation of the control of cell division.\" — 2006 \"For his outstanding contribution to theoretical physics and theoretical cosmology. \" 2007 \"for his seminal studies of interactions within and among biological populations that have reshaped our understanding of how species, communities and entire ecosystems respond to natural or human created disturbance.\" — 2008 \"for his beautiful and original insights into many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Sir Roger has made outstanding contributions to general relativity theory and cosmology, most notably for his work on black holes and the Big Bang.\" — 2009 \"for his seminal work on embryonic stem cells in mice, which revolutionised the field of genetics.\" — 2010 \"for his seminal contributions to the theory and applications of statistics.\" Two medals were awarded to celebrate the Society's 350th anniversary: 2010 \"for his seminal contributions to the understanding of the biochemistry of DNA repair.\" 2011 \"For his seminal contributions to the understanding of geological and geophysical phenomena including tectonic plates.\" — 2012 \"For his ground- breaking work on bioenergetics, discovering the mechanism of ATP synthesis in the mitochondrion.\" 2013 \"For his numerous scientific contributions and, in particular, for initiating research on two‐dimensional atomic crystals and their artificial heterostructures.\" — 2014 \"For his pioneering work on variation and mutation in the human genome.\" 2015 \"For his fundamental contribution to particle physics with his theory explaining the origin of mass in elementary particles, confirmed by the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider.\" Copley Medal 2015 2016 \"In recognition of his fundamental and revolutionary contributions to the development of electron microscopy of biological materials, enabling their atomic structures to be deduced.\" Copley Medal 2016 2017 \"For his beautiful and unexpected proof of Fermat's Last Theorem which is one of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century.\" 2018 \"For his contributions to understanding the role of gut microbial communities to human health and disease.\" Copley Medal 2018 == References == Category:Science awards Category:Royal Society",
