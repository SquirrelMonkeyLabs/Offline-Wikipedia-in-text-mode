 "text": "The Mordovian languages are a group of two closely related Finno-Ugric languages: Erzya and Moksha. They are primarily spoken in the Republic of Mordovia, which is located in central Russia. The Mordovian languages are an important part of the Uralic language family. These languages are a symbol of identity for Mordovian language speakers. == Overview == === Language family === Mordovian languages belong to the Uralic language family, which includes Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. ===Languages and dialects=== The two Mordovian languages are Erzya (spoken by the Erzya people) and Moksha (spoken by the Moksha people). Both of these languages have several dialects. Erzya has a feature called vowel harmony, while Moksha maintains its own unique sounds and grammar. == Distribution == Mordovian languages are mainly spoken in Mordovia. However, there are also Mordovian language-speaking communities in neighboring regions and among diaspora populations. == Writing system == Both Mordovian languages use a modified Cyrillic script. == Cultural significance == Mordovian languages are vital to the cultural identity of the Mordovian peoples. They are used in folk traditions, music, and literature, reflecting the region's rich heritage. == Current status == Challenges include a decreasing number of Mordovian language speakers and the influence of Russian in the area. However, there are ongoing revitalization efforts, including educational programs and cultural initiatives to promote these languages. There have been efforts to promote literacy and education in both Erzya and Moksha. Category:Uralic languages",
