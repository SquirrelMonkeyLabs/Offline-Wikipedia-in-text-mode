 "text": "The Socialist Republic of Croatia (), or SR Croatia, was a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is the predecessor of modern-day Croatia. It was formed during World War II and became a socialist republic after the war. It had four full official names during its 48-year existence. By territory and population, it was the second largest republic in Yugoslavia, after the Socialist Republic of Serbia. In 1990, the government dismantled the single-party system of government – installed by the League of Communists – and adopted a multi-party democracy. The newly elected government of Franjo Tuđman moved the republic towards independence, formally seceding from Yugoslavia in 1991. ==References== Category:1943 establishments in Europe Category:1991 disestablishments in Europe Category:Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Category:20th-century establishments in Croatia",
