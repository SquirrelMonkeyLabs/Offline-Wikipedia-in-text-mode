 "text": "A colt is a young male horse, under the age of four. Older male horses are called either a \"stallion\", if left fertile, or a \"gelding\" if neutered. The verb \"to geld\" refers to the process of neutering a stallion. A young female horse is called a filly until age four, and a mare thereafter. A group of colts is called a \"rag\". == References == == Other websites == * Category:Horses",
