 "text": "The Game Boy Sound System, also named GBS, is a file format made to play music made for the Game Boy. Like the Game Boy, four sounds can be played at the same time: two pulse waves, one 4-bit PCM (32 repeating samples in stereo) and one noise (sounds like static). GBS music files can be ripped and played with special players and Game Boy emulators. ==Players== * Kobarin Media Player - GBS and many more chiptune formats can be played. A Winamp plugin converter is included. * Audacious - A *nix player that can play GBS. * Chipamp - A Winamp plug-in bundle by OverClocked ReMix that allows more than 40 chiptune and tracker formats to be played. * gbsplay - An open source player for Linux and *nix.
