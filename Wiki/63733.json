 "text": "A knight is a chess piece. It is represented by a horse's head and neck. Each player starts the game with two knights. It moves in an L pattern, two squares in one direction then one square in another. It is the only piece in chess that can jump over other pieces. It is also the only piece that can be in position to attack a king, queen, bishop, or rook without also being attacked by that piece. 'Knight' is shortened to Kt or N when recording games. In printed game scores, it is represented by a figurine. Knight",
