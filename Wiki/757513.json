 "text": "A resistance movement is an organized movement by some portion of the civil population of a country to fight against an occupying power and to cause civil disorder. Sometimes they could be a nonviolent resistance (sometimes called civil resistance), or the use of force. In many cases, as for example in Norway in the Second World War, a resistance movement may have had both violent and non-violent methods.On the relation between military and civil resistance in occupied Norway 1940–45, see Magne Skodvin, \"Norwegian Non- violent Resistance during the German Occupation\", in Adam Roberts (ed.), The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression, Faber, London, 1967, pp. 136–53. (Also published as Civilian Resistance as a National Defense, Harrisburg, US: Stackpole Books, 1968; and, with a new Introduction on \"Czechoslovakia and Civilian Defence\", as Civilian Resistance as a National Defence, Harmondsworth, UK/Baltimore, US: Penguin Books, 1969. .) ==Notes== Category:Civil disobedience",
