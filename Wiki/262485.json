In 2002, he became the senator for finance in the German state of Berlin. In May 2009, he has become a member of the executive board of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Sarrazin published the book Deutschland schafft sich ab (\"Germany Abolishes Itself\") with controversial comments about the German immigration system. The book was published on 30 August 2010. His book led the executive board members of the Bundesbank to ask to dismiss Thilo Sarrazin from his office. This must be done by the German Bundespräsident Christian Wulff. After an agreement with the German Bundesbank, Thilo Sarrazin will leave his post at the end of September. Sarrazin is also known for statements such as the following: :\"Integration needs performance from those that are to be integrated. I will not show respect for anyone that is not performing in that way. I do not have to acknowledge anyone who lives by welfare, denies the very state that provides that welfare, refuses to care for the education of his children and constantly produces new little headscarf-girls.\"Integration.
