 "text": "A non-nucleophilic base is a type of chemical compound that is a base but not a nucleophile. A non-nucleophilic base will accept hydrogen ions from Br√∏nsted acids, but will not form adducts with other Lewis acids. Non-nucleophilic bases are protected from electrophiles by steric hindrance, where the shape of the molecule blocks other chemicals from reacting with it. Non-nucleophilic bases normally have large organic functional groups that increase steric hindrance, such as the isopropyl group in lithium diisopropylamide. Category:Bases",
