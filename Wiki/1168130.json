The USSR succeeded the Russian Empire, which had a centuries-old history of antisemitism, * * * * * including repeated pogroms. * * * * * * * * * * However, antisemitism persisted in the USSR, fluctuating throughout the Cold War. * * * The persecution of Jews in the USSR lasted until the union ceased to exist on December 26, 1991. ==Under Joseph Stalin (1922–1953)== Between 1922 and 1953, Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) was the leaderGeneral Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU): April 3, 1922 – October 16, 1952 Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union: May 6, 1941 – March 5, 1953 of the USSR. Despite playing a significant role in defeating Nazi Germany and ending the Holocaust that caused over 6,000,000 Jewish deaths (67% of pre-war European Jews), * * * * * Stalin launched state campaigns to persecute Soviet Jews. * * * Etinger, Iakov (1995). \"The Doctors' Plot: Stalin's Solution to the Jewish Question\". In Yaacov Ro'i, Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union. London: Frank Cass. , pp. 103–6. * * * * * * * * * Soviet Jews of professional backgrounds, especially writers, were accused of having \"bourgeois Western influences\" from 1946 onwards. * * * * * * ===Anti-cosmopolitan campaign=== Soviet state propaganda emphasized the imagined harm posed by the so-called rootless cosmopolitans (Russian: безродный космополит, romanized: bezrodnyi kosmopolit) with whom Soviet Jews were accused of being associated. The propaganda backed up the \"anti- cosmopolitan campaign\" between 1948 and 1953, which involved antisemitic purges and executions across the USSR and her satellite states. The persecution peaked in the Doctors' Plot when Stalin falsely accused Jewish doctors of planning to poison the Soviet leaders based on a medieval antisemitic trope. These came at a time of tension between the newly founded State of Israel and the USSR, when Israel began allying with the United States (US). As per historian Cathy S. Gelbin, at p.865. As per literature professor Margarita Levantovskaya, ===Soviet occupation zone in Germany=== Such antisemitic policies extended to the Soviet occupation zone in Germany, which later formed the German Democratic Republic (GDR) (German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR)), commonly known as the East Germany. American historian Norman Naimark noted that Soviet governors showed a \"growing obsession\" with the presence of Jews in the military government. East German Jews who opposed Soviet communism were classed as having \"non-Aryan background lined up with the bourgeois parties\". The policies continued under Nikita Khrushchev (1894–1971), who ruled the USSR between 1953 and 1964. ==Under Leonid Brezhnev (1964–1982)== The persecution of Jews in the USSR intensified under Leonid Brezhnev's rule when Israel defeated the Soviet-armed Arab League in the 1967 Six-Day War. Antisemitic propaganda in the form of \"anti-Zionist\" broadcasting appeared, such as the film Secret and Explicit, which demonized Jews as a malign Zionist cabal based on stereotypes from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Many of Brezhnev's close advisors, especially Mikhail Suslov, were radical antisemites. Jewish emigration to Israel or the United States (US) was heavily restricted,Joseph Dunner.

Written permission from all close family members was also required, with a low application approval rate. Systemic racism against Jews was widespread, which caught little attention from Western academic leftists. * * * * Boris Kochubievsky, a Ukrainian-Jewish radio engineer, wrote Brezhnev a letter: Shortly after, Kochubievsky was kidnapped by the KGB into a mental asylum. Almost all Soviet Jews were reportedly affected by the post-1967 wave of antisemitism, despite common leftist indifference. In 1969, Soviet propagandist Yuri Ivanov condemned Zionism as a \"capitalist imperialist\" construct:Caution: Zionism! Essays on the Ideology, Organisation and Practice of Zionism Just as academically influential Western \"anti-Zionists\", * * * * * Soviet leaders denied that their \"anti-Zionism\" was antisemitic by alleging that many of their \"anti-Zionist\" officials were Jewish. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the World Zionist Organization (WZO) was also accused of \"controlling Western media\" and \"participating in colonialism\" worldwide.Source: Большая советская энциклопедия / Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition. 1969–1978; translation. The third edition of the thirty-volume Great Soviet Encyclopedia (Большая Советская энциклопедия, БСЭ) claims the following: * \"The main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti-Communism and anti- Sovietism\" * \"The anti-human reactionary essence of Zionism\" is \"overt and covert fight against freedom movements and against the USSR\" * \"International Zionist Organization owns major financial funds, partly through Jewish monopolists and partly collected by Jewish mandatory charities\", it also \"influences or controls significant part of media agencies and outlets in the West\" * \"Serving as the front squad of colonialism and neo-colonialism, international Zionism actively participates in the fight against national liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America\" * \"A natural and objective assimilation process of Jews is growing around the world.\" In his book A History of the Jews in the Modern World, American historian Howard Sachar stated that Soviet \"anti-Zionism\" was not much different from Nazism:Howard Sachar, A History of the Jews in the Modern World (New York: Knopf, 2005) p.722 The persecution did not fade until the 1980s, when Brezhnev reportedly changed course in 1981 by indirectly disapproving of antisemitism at a Communist Party meeting. * \"The CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] has fought and will always fight resolutely against such phenomena [inter-ethnic tensions] which are alien to the nature of socialism as chauvinism or nationalism, against any nationalistic aberrations such as, let us say, anti-Semitism or Zionism. We are against tendencies aimed at artificial erosion of national characteristics [. ...] the sacred duty of the party [is] to educate the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and socialist internationalism, of a proud feeling of belonging to a single great Soviet motherland.\" * * Despite Brezhnev's reported disapproval of antisemitism, antisemitic propaganda remained widespread in the USSR. Sometimes, those antisemitic propaganda promoted the false claim of \"active WWII Nazi‒Zionist collaboration\". * * * * * * * * * * * The false claim is still commonly exploited by antisemites on the far right and far left to trivialize the Holocaust and demonize the vast majority of diaspora Jews who support Israel's right to exist. ==Late Cold War== Pravda (CPSU's official newspaper) ran an \"anti-Zionist\" front-page article on April 1, 1983, * * * * * * whose viewpoints are still widely shared by academically influential Western \"anti-Zionists\": ==Aftermath== It is estimated that about 2,750,000 Soviet Jews left the USSR between May 9, 1945 and December 26, 1991, with most departing after 1989 when exit control was relaxed. Soviet antisemitism's influence extended far beyond USSR's borders. Notably, it has left a long- lasting mark on American society. Famous pro-Soviet Black nationalists, especially Malcolm X (1925–1965), adopted the Soviet antisemitic tropes and mainstreamed them via circulation among academia and Black Americans, from whom the influential antisemitic groups Nation of Islam (NOI) * * * * * * * and Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) drew massive support. Particularly, NOI's leader Louis Farrakhan was classified by the American civil rights group Anti- Defamation League (ADL) as the most popular antisemite in America. In American society, Soviet antisemitic tropes were normalized over the decades and engendered a form of new antisemitism, * * * * * where Jews are accused of being the \"beneficiaries\" of \"White privilege\" that \"controlled\" Western governments to \"support Israel at the expense of Palestinians\" and \"colonise oppressed peoples\". * * * * * As per a 2016 survey by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 23% Black Americans held negative beliefs about Jews, while a 2023 survey reportedly showed that one-eighth of Black Americans doubted whether the Holocaust really happened. ==Academic views== ===Walter Laqueur=== Walter Laqueur (1921–2018), a German-American historian, summarized his research: ===David Hirsh=== David Hirsh (1967 – ), a British historian, shared similar views: ==Public views== Public figures also commented on \"anti-Zionism\" associated with the antisemitism in the Soviet Union and her puppet states. ===David Neil=== Writing for the Algemeiner, real estate executive David Neil pointed out that academia played a huge role in modern antisemitism, with \"anti-Zionism\" being an academically driven \"revisionist movement\" similar to the pro-Confederate Lost Cause movement once popular in elite universities, especially the Columbia University, * * * * as noted by W. E. B. Du Bois in his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America: Neil said that the Lost Cause phenomenon was a classical case of how harmful beliefs can become normalized by universities spreading racism under the pretence of social justice. ==Related pages== * Khazar myth * Antisemitism in Europe * Double genocide theory * Soviet persecution of Poles during World War II ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Racism Category:Marxism Category:Cold War Category:Communism Category:Soviet Union Category:Antisemitism Category:Jewish history Category:Discrimination Category:Eastern Europe Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:History of the Soviet Union",
