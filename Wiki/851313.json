 "text": "The flag of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) was adopted in 1968 and the design is a green- white-green vertical tricolour similar to the flag of Nigeria with the coat of arms of Rhodesia in the middle. It was adopted in 1968 to replace the sky blue ensign used by Southern Rhodesia (1964–1965) and Rhodesia (1965–1968). In 1979, Rhodesia changed its name to Zimbabwe Rhodesia and adopted a new flag before being under British rule from 1979-1980 which resulted Zimbabwe being de jure independent in 1980. ==Gallery== Flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia (1979).svg|Flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia (1979) Flag of Rhodesia (1968–1979).svg|Flag of Rhodesia (1968–1979) Flag of Rhodesia (1964–1968).svg|Flag of Rhodesia (1964–1968) ==Related pages== *Flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia Category:Rhodesia Category:Flags with coats of arms Category:Historical flags",
