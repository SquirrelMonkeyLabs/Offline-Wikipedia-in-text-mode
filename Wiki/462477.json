Each pair of polygon sides on the same axis will have a quadrilateral (four-sided shape) face between them. There are an infinite number of different prisms, which can be based on a polygon with any number of sides. A cube is a special kind of prism with squares for the faces on its ends and for the faces between them. Category:Polyhedra",
