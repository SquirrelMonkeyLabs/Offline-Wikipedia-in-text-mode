 "text": "The WAGR Lw class was a single diesel-electric locomotive operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1994 to 1997/8. The Lw was the result of Comalco selling their R class No. 1002 to Westrail in 1994, it was renumbered 276 and reclassified as Lw, due to differing from the standard L class. Around 1997 it was sold off initially to be used for spare parts. Currently, the locomotive is numbered LZ3120 under Aurizon, who after withdrawing it, reactivated it in 2021 for grain traffic in New South Wales. It returned back to Western Australia in late 2022.
