On 24 August 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her under a free lease from the Conservation Commission of Maryland. She was used during World War I. She was commissioned as USS Buck (SP-1355) on 13 September 1917. Assigned to the 5th Naval District, Buck served as a tender at Norfolk, Virginia, for the remainder of World War I. She was renamed USS SP-1355 in April 1918. SP-1355 was decommissioned late in 1918. The Navy returned her to Consevration Commission of Maryland on either 24 September 1918 or 27 November 1918.The Department of the Navy Naval History and Heritage Command and NavSource Online both claim the date was 27 November 1918, but the entry at Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships states that conflicting records exist and that either date is possible. ==Notes== ==References== * *Department of the Navy Naval History and Heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy Ships: USS Buck (SP-1355), 1917-1918.
