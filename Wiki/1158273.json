 "text": "The district of Santa Ana, Manila (traditionally shortened to \"Sta. Ana\") had its original name as Meysapan (or Sapa, meaning a marsh) and ruled by the ancient Tagalog Kingdom of Namayan. The kingdomâ€™s domain stretched from what is now Mandaluyong, Makati, Pasay, and the Manila districts of Pandacan and Paco. It was given by the Spanish conquerors to the Franciscan missionaries from Spain in 1578, and subsequently named it Santa Ana de Sapa (\"Saint Anne of the Marshes\"), dedicated to Saint Anne, the mother of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The sound of its ancient name, \"Namayan\", had a similar sound to \"Ana\", which may have been its basis.
