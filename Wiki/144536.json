 "text": "River Tay is a river in Scotland. It starts in Loch Tay, and opens up into the North Sea at the Firth of Tay. It discharges more water than the Thames and the Severn put together.BBC: The River: a year in the life of the Tay. It is the longest river in Scotland and the sixth longest in the United Kingdom. It starts in the Scottish Highlands, and moves east until it goes through Perth. Its mouth is wide, and is called the Firth of Tay on the east coast. Dundee is on the north bank of the Firth. The Tay's very wide mouth is spanned by a long rail bridge, the replacement for the one which fell in the Tay Bridge disaster. The Tay Road Bridge was opened in 1966. == References == Category:Rivers of Scotland",
