 "text": "The Ceratioidei, also called the deep-sea anglerfish, are one of four suborders of anglerfish. As their name suggests, they live in the deep sea. In females, a bioluminescent organ, the \"esca\", is present, guiding them in the dark and attracting prey. One unique trait is that the male uses his small, sharp teeth to latch onto the female, holding on for the rest of his (and her) life. == Families == * Caulophrynidae Goode & Bean, 1896 (Fanfins) * Neoceratiidae Regan, 1926 (Toothed seadevil) * Melanocetidae Gill, 1878 (Black seadevils) * Himantolophidae Gill, 1861 (Footballfishes) * Diceratiidae Regan & Trewavas, 1932 (Double anglers) * Oneirodidae Gill, 1878 (Dreamers) * Thaumatichthyidae Smith & Radcliffe, 1912 (Wolftrap anglers) * Centrophrynidae Bertelsen, 1951 (Horned lantern fish) * Ceratiidae Gill, 1861 (Warty seadevils) * Gigantactinidae Boulenger, 1904 (Whipnose anglers) * Linophrynidae Regan, 1925 (Leftvents) == References == Category:Ray-finned fish Category:Bioluminescent animals",
