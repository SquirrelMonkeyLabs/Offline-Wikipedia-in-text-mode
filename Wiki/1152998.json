 "text": "MosaLingua (/ˌmoʊsəˈlɪŋɡwə/) is an online platform for learning languages. It was created in 2009 by Samuel Michelot and Luca Sadurny. The platform helps users improve their skills in different foreign languages. MosaLingua offers a paid service called \"MosaLingua Premium,\" which works on the web and mobile devices. It also has apps for Android and iOS. == History == MosaLingua was started in 2009 by Samuel Michelot and Luca Sadurny. The idea came from their interest in finding better ways to learn languages. At first, the platform was a mobile app. It used spaced repetition and memory techniques to help users learn vocabulary. Over time, MosaLingua added more features and courses. It now offers many languages, like English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese. The platform uses audio, flashcards, and artificial intelligence to teach languages. == Languages Offered == MosaLingua offers courses in these languages: * German * French * English * Medical English * Business English * English for TOEIC * English for TOEFL * Spanish * Business Spanish * Italian * Portuguese * Russian * Korean * Chinese * Japanese * Arabic == Method == MosaLingua uses techniques like the Pareto Principle, spaced repetition (SRS), and memory tricks to help users learn. The Pareto Principle (also called the 80/20 rule) says that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. In language learning, this means focusing on the most useful words and grammar first. Spaced repetition schedules reviews of words and phrases over time to help learners remember them longer. === MosaWeb === MosaWeb is the main service of MosaLingua. It includes videos, audiobooks, texts, and other tools. It helps users improve their listening, reading, and writing skills in different languages. === MosaDiscovery === MosaDiscovery helps users learn new words while browsing the internet or watching videos on platforms like Netflix or YouTube. It gives instant translations or definitions, and users can save these as flashcards. === MosaChat-AI === MosaChat-AI is an artificial intelligence tool. It allows users to practice speaking and writing with a virtual assistant. The AI gives real-time corrections and creates flashcards from the conversations. == Criticism == Some users find MosaLingua hard to use because it has too many options. Fabienne and Benoît from Novo-Monde said the app is \"very complete but may be confusing for beginners.\" Others think MosaLingua focuses too much on vocabulary and not enough on grammar or conversation. Many users say they need to combine it with other methods to get better results. == References == Category:Learning",
