 "text": "Tromsdalen detention camp was a prison built by the Nazis. It was built during the occupation of the Germans in Norway during World War II. It was in Tromsdalen, Norway. It was used as a place to hold prisoners before they were sent to other camps. Over 2000 prisoners were held there. The camp had five prisoner barracks, three personnel barracks, a toilet/wash barrack, a kitchen, and a tool shed. Prisoners were forced to work and were punished for any mistakes. Some prisoners were treated very badly, especially those who were part of the resistance against the Nazis. Women were also held at the camp and were given potatoes to peel all day. The Nazis executed 26 Yugoslavian prisoners shortly after they arrived at the camp, and eight prisoners were executed in retaliation for a partisan action that killed 22 Germans. Today, the site of the camp is occupied by Tromstun School, and a memorial marker has been placed there to remember the innocent people who was killed there. == References == Category:Nazi concentration camps in Norway",
