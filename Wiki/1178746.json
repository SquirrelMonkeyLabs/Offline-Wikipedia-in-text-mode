It follows her Spanish-language album Mi Reflejo (2000) and her album Liberation (2018). The album is named after her Spanish surname, and she made it to celebrate her Latin American roots and to connect with her childrenâ€™s heritage. Aguilera is a trilogy with three parts: La Fuerza, La Tormenta, and La Luz. Each part represents a theme of strength and healing. The album features different types of Latin music like cumbia, tango, reggaeton, and tropical sounds. It also mixes in dance-pop and Latin pop styles. There are collaborations with artists like Becky G, Nicki Nicole, Ozuna, and Christian Nodal. Five singles were released, including \"Pa Mis Muchachas\" and \"Santo\".
