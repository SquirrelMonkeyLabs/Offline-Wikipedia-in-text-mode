 "text": "SCUM Manifesto is a radical feminist manifesto by Valerie Solanas, published in 1967. It argues that men have \"ruined\" the world, and that it is up to women to fix it. To achieve this goal, it suggests the formation of SCUM, an organization dedicated to overthrowing society and eliminating the male sex. The Manifesto is widely regarded as satirical, but based on legitimate philosophical and social concerns. It has been reprinted at least ten times in English, translated into thirteen languages, and excerpted several times.https://www.thenation.com/article/cutting-remarks/ Cutting Remarks | The Nation The SCUM Manifesto suggested that men, seen as 'incomplete females', longed for qualities traditionally associated with women, leading to misogyny and societal issues. Menâ€™s skill in public relations obscured this truth, convincing many women that gender roles were reversed. ==References== Category:Feminism",
