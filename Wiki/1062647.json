 "text": "A glory hole is a hole that is cut into the side of a bathroom stall or wall. People use these holes to have anonymous sex with each other. Glory holes became popular in the 1950s-70s with the gay community when homosexuality was outlawed or was a criminal act in many places. They started to lose popularity during the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s and when homosexuality was decriminalized in many places. While popular with gay men, glory holes have also been used by heterosexual and bisexual people. ==References== Category:Human sexuality Category:Sexual slang Category:Toilets",
