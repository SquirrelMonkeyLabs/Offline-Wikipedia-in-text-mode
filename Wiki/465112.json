Epub 2002 Oct 8. Plant defensins. They are host defence peptides. They work against bacteria, fungi and many viruses. Defensins have 18-45 amino acids including six to eight conserved cysteine residues.\"Conserved\" means the sequence stays the same in almost all individuals in the population. Cells of the immune system have these peptides to help kill phagocytosed bacteria. Those cells include neutrophil granulocytes and almost all epithelial cells. Most defensins work by binding to the microbial cell membrane. Once there, they make tiny holes in the membrane which allow vital ions and nutrients to leak out. == Related pages == *Host defence peptide *Lysozyme *innate immune system == Notes == Category:Proteins Category:Immunology",
