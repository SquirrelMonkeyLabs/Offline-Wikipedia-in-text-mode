She was a short fencer, and her style has been described as \"graceful\". At the end of 1911 she participated at the 1911 Belgiumâ€“Netherlands women's fencing meeting and competed against the Dutch fencers N. Fraenkel. In 1914 De Deken was one of the two Belgian women who competed at the 1914 Salle Giandomenici international women's fencing competition in Amsterdam. This competition was the first women's fencing competition in the Netherlands with Dutch, British and Belgian competitors. She had a very nice match during the competition. Overall she was the best Belgian women and won the fourth prize behind C. E. Martin Edmunds, Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo and Rosamund Johnstone. In May 1914 she won the third prize at the international 1914 \"La Femme Contemporaine\" women's fencing competition in Antwerp. ==References== ==Other websites== *Image of De Deken - at the international tournament in Amsterdam in 1914 Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Belgian fencers Category:Sportspeople from Antwerp Category:Sportswomen Category:19th-century births Category:20th-century deaths",
