 "text": "In science, a property is anything that describes a material or substance. It is a characteristic of that material. For example, how hard the material is, its colour, or its shape. Elasticity is a property of rubber; in other words: rubber is elastic. A property may be a constant (always the same) or it may only appear when something changes, such as temperature. Chemical properties include things like surface tension, pH, reactivity, allotropy. Conductivity is how able a material is to transport electric charge or heat. ==Other examples== * Ductility, how easy it is to stretch a material * Flammability, how easily a material will catch fire * Luminosity, how bright an object is * Malleability, how easy it is to re-shape a material without damaging it * Permeability, how dense a magnetic field would be if current passes through it * Tensile strength, how much force must be applied to a material to break it * Viscosity, how thick a fluid is ==Related pages== * Physical property * Chemical property Category:Materials science",
