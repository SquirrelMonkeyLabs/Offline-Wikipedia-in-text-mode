 "text": "The Vishva Hindu Parishad (विश्व हिन्दू परिषद्) (VHP), meaning \"World Council of Hindus,\" is a right-wing Hindu organization in India that promotes Hindu nationalism. It was founded in 1964 by M. S. Golwalkar, S. S. Apte, and Swami Chinmayananda. Its goal is to unite Hindus and protect Hindu traditions. The VHP focuses on building and renovating Hindu temples, addressing issues like cow slaughter and religious conversions. It is part of the Sangh Parivar, a group of Hindu nationalist organizations led by the RSS. The VHP has been criticised for contributing to violence against Muslims in India, most notably for its role in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 over the Ayodhya dispute. == References == Category:Articles with excerpts Category:Coordinates not on Wikidata Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas Category:Hinduism",
