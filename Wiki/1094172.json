 "text": "Jund al-Aqsa (Arabic: جُنْدُ الْأَقْصَى; Liwa al-Aqsa after early 2017) was a Islamist militant group that fought in the Syrian Civil War. It used to be called Sarayat al-Quds and it was founded by Abu Abdulaziz al Qatari as a part of the Al-Nusra Front. It later broke away from the Al-Nusra Front due to fighting with Daesh. On the 20th of September 2016, the United States called Jund al-Aqsa a terrorist group. The group decided to rejoin the Al-Nusra Front which was now called Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) in October 2016. However, JFS decided to remove Jund al-Aqsa from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. == Other websites == * Jund al-Aqsa's YouTube Channel == References == Category:Islamic State Category:Al-Qaeda Category:Militant groups Category:Islamist militant groups",
