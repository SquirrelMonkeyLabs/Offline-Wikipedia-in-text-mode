 "text": "Texaco (or The Texas Company; originally called The Texas Fuel Company) is an American petroleum and gasoline company. It was founded in 1902 in Beaumont, Texas. The Chevron Corporation bought the Texaco company in late 2000. In 1931, Texaco bought the Indian Oil Company. The Indian Oil Company was in Illinois. This expanded the company's refining and marketing base across the midwestern United States. It also gave Texaco rights to Indian's Havoline motor oil (which became a Texaco product). In 1994, the System3 gasolines by Texaco were replaced with new CleanSystem3 gasoline for improved engine performance. Texaco gasoline contains Techron, an additive developed by Chevron in 2005. It replaces the previous CleanSystem3. This Texaco brand is strong in Latin America, the United States and West Africa. It is also in Europe. In the United Kingdom, there are about 850 Texaco-branded gas stations. In 2010, Texaco ended business operations across the Mid-Atlantic States. Texaco removed its brand from 450 stations in Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky and Washington, D.C.. Texaco once did business in and around the Quad Cities of southeastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois. In the 2000s decade, however, the stores were closed. They were then replaced with Kwik Shop stores in Iowa and with Gas Land stores in Illinois. ==References== Category:Companies based in Texas Category:Companies based in California Category:American fuel companies Category:1902 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Texas",
