 "text": "The Mandarin orange, also known as the mandarin or mandarine (both lower- case), is a small citrus tree (Citrus reticulata) with fruit that looks like other oranges. Mandarin oranges are usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. The mandarin is tender, and is damaged easily by cold. It can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas. Mandarin oranges contain many nutrients but is highest in vitamin C and calcium. A medium mandarin contains approximately 22 grams of vitamin C and 31 grams of calcium. The mandarin is easily peeled with the fingers, and can be easily split into even segments without squirting juice. This makes it more convenient to eat, as utensils are not required to peel or cut the fruit. Mandarin segments are also sold in cans. During Chinese New Year, Mandarin oranges and tangerines are considered traditional symbols of good fortune. During the two-week celebration, they are frequently displayed as decoration and presented as gifts to friends, relatives, and business partners. == Production volume == Tangerines, mandarins, clementines Top ten producers in 2007 (1000 tonnes) Tangerines, mandarins, clementines Top ten producers in 2007 (1000 tonnes) 15,185 1,974 1,206 1,066 1,042 778 748 744 702 670 640 All other 4,156 World total 27,869 Source: UN Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Source: UN Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO), == References == == Other websites == * Mandarin Orange Nutrition Facts * UC Riverside Mandarin Variety Descriptions * Tangerines Nutrient Content Category:Citrus",
