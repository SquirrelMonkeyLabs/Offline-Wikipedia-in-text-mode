When Anna takes a nap, Fly and Stella sneak out to go fishing. Chuck follows them. They meet a mad scientist named Professor MacKrill. MacKrill is scared of global warming.

Stella becomes thirsty, drinks the potion and turns into a starfish, She then gets lost in the ocean. Fly drinks the potion and turns into a California flying fish so he can look for her. Chuck does not know how to swim so he drinks the potion. It turns him into a jellyfish. MacKrill warns him that if they do not drink the antidote in the next two days then they will stay fish for the rest of their lives. A Great White Shark and pilot fish accidentally drink part of the antidote. This gives them human intelligence. The pilot fish names himself Joe and creates a civilization of talking fish with himself as the leader. After Fly tries to steal the antidote from him, Joe has Fly, Chuck and Stella locked up but they escape.
