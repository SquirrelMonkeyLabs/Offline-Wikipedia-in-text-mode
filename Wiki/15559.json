 "text": "The Dead Sea is a lake located in the southwestern of Asia. It is the Earth's lowest surface, located 420 meters (1,380 feet) below sea level. The sea is drying up as basin countries use water from its tributaries for drinking water and processes like irrigation. The Dead Sea is almost nine times as salty as the ocean because a lot of water evaporates out of it, leaving salt behind. Most life cannot survive its high salinity, which is why it is called the \"Dead Sea\". However, some microbes have adapted to the high salinity and are able to survive in the Dead Sea's harsh environment. Because the water is so salty, it weighs more than fresh water. This allows people to float in the Dead Sea without any effort. Tourists come from around the world to float in the water. ==Gallery== DeadSea3667.jpg|A rough Dead Sea, with salt deposits on cliffs Dead sea newspaper.jpg|Reading a newspaper while floating in the Dead Sea STS028-96-65.jpg | View of salt evaporation pans on the Dead Sea, taken in 1989 from the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-28).
