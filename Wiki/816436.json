 "text": "The Human Development Index (HDI) is a number from 0 to 1 (higher is better) used to compare different countries. It is published by United Nations Development Programme. It is used to rank countries into different groups for example developed and developing countries. The Human Development Index uses different measurements of a population: * Life expectancy at birth. This is used to see how healthy the people in one country are. It assumes that healthier people live longer on average. * Literacy is used to look at how educated people are, for example how many adults can read and write. One third of this is the gross enrollment ratio, which measures how many of children of schooling age attend school. * Standard of living. This is measured by calculating the gross domestic product with the total population so that it becomes comparable. == List of African countries == This is a list of the Human Development Index (HDI) for countries in Africa from the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report for 2019, published in 2020.
