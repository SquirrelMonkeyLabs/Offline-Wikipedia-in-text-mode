 "text": "Cell junctions join cells in some biological tissues. They have long protein chains, The proteins keep connections between neighbouring cells or between a cell and other structures. They also control substance transport outside cell surfaces.R. Rieger; A. Michaelis & Green M.M. 1976 Glossary of genetics and cytogenetics: classical and molecular. Berlin; New York: Springer-Verlag, p. 62. Vertebrates have three main types of cell junction: *Adherens junctions: holds cells together and provides tissues with structural support. They are common where mechanical stress occurs eg. skin or heart **desmosomes **hemidesmosomes *Gap junctions: allows for chemical communication between neighbouring cells *Tight junctions: regulate movement of water and liquids between epithelial layers == Related pages == *Desmosome *Fusome ==References== Category:Cell biology",
