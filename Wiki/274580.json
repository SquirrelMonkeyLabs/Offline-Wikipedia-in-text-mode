After his debut, many hiphop fellows joined the DT clan and he made a debut in Korea in 1998. The first team members were Micki Eyez and Sucram.

DT's first album was Year of The Tiger, and the debut songs are \"Do you know hip hop (Return of Tiger)\" and \"I want you (Sweet Talk)\". When DJ Shine left DT it caused a great concern in the Korean hip hop community. It is not known why DJ Shine quit DT. Tiger JK is the only member of DT, and he continues using the name of DT.
