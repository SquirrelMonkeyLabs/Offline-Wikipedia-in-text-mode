 "text": "Reforesting is the process of replacing plants in an area where they have been cut down or destroyed. It usually refers to trees, but could include other types of plant life. Reforestation is often needed after deforestation, when trees are cut down to make lumber. Reforestation also regains back the homes of animals. == Related pages == *Conservation biology *Environmentalism Category:Forests",
