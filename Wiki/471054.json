It is one of the oriole family of passerine birds. It is a summer migrant in Europe and western Asia and spends the winter season in central and southern Africa. Golden orioles have an extremely large range with large populations that are apparently stable. == Taxonomy and systematics == Until a few years ago this species was treated as being conspecific with the Indian golden oriole. They are now in separate species. ==References== Category:Birds of Europe Category:Passeri Category:Birds of Asia Category:Birds of Africa",
