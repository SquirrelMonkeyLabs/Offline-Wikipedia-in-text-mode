 "text": "A ceremonial first pitch is a tradition in baseball. It is when a special person throws a ball to mark the start of the game. The person used to throw the ball to the pitcher of the home team from their seat. This changed when United States President Ronald Reagan threw a pitch from the field, similar to how a pitcher threw the ball. Because of Reagan, the person now stands in front of the pitcher's mound and throws the ball to home plate. The person who catches the ball is often from the home team. The tradition was first done in the United States in the 1800s. The person is often a celebrity or other important person who is at the game. It may also be an important person from a company to gives money to the baseball team, or somebody who won a contest to throw the first pitch. Sometimes many first pitches are thrown. == References == Category:Baseball",
