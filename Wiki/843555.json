 "text": "Under criminal law, conspiracy is agreeing between two or more people to commit a crime sometime in the future. Examples of conspiracy include conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to kidnap or conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy law usually does not need proof of specific intent by defendants to hurt any specific person to establish an illegal agreement. Conspirators could be guilty even if they do not know the identity of the other conspiracy members. Conspiracy against the United States is a federal offense. ==References== Category:Crime",
