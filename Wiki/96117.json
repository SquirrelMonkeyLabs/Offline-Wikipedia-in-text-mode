 "text": "Mark the Evangelist (מרקוס, ) was one of the followers of Jesus Christ. He is believed to be the writer of the Gospel of Mark. He is believed by some scholars to be the young man found in chapter 14, verses 51-52 of the gospel. The Copts think Mark brought Christianity to Egypt. It was his house where Jesus and his disciples ate the last supper. מרקוס and Μάρκος are both pronounced as Markus which more consistent with Aramaic and Hebrew understanding of Roman names. Markus was a Roman who accepted Jesus Christ along with others. Category:New Testament people Category:Ancient Israeli people",
