 "text": "The Dayak are the native ethnic group of Borneo. There is no Dayak culture, because the word is used for many different groups of people. Dayak live on the island of Borneo, that is either in Brunei, Indonesia or Malaysia. Originally, the Dayak had their own religions, which were a mix of animism and shamanism. In the 20th century, many Dayak converted to either Christianity or Islam. Some didn't, and they call their religion Kaharingan. For reasons of classifying, Kaharingan has been made a form of Hinduism. ==Gallery== Dayak Couples.jpg|Dayak Couples Dayak Dancers.jpg|Dayak Dancers Dayak face.jpg|Dayak face Dayak fashion and style.jpg|Dayak fashion and style Dayak little Dancers.jpg|Dayak little Dancers Dayak Parade.jpg|Dayak Parade Dayak Shaman.jpg|Dayak Shaman Dayak Traditional dance of South Kalimantan Province.jpg|Dayak Traditional dance of South Kalimantan Province Dayak warior accssories.jpg|Dayak warior accssories Dayak Warrior.jpg|Dayak Warrior Category:Indonesian people Category:Ethnic groups in Asia Category:Malaysian people Category:Borneo",
