 "text": "Pinyin is a way to write letters showing the sound of a word in place of a Chinese character. Today, it almost always has the sense of Hanyu Pinyin, the way of writing Mandarin sounds which has been used by the People's Republic of China from the 1950s. Other place like the United States and Taiwan used other ways of spelling Chinese (such as Wade-Giles and Tongyong Pinyin) for a long time, but in the late 20th century, they started to use Hanyu Pinyin as well. It is the standard romanization system in China and in the United Nations and is the most common for Chinese. Pinyin uses Roman letters in a special way for certain Chinese sounds. For example, the pinyin letter C is pronounced as /ts/ as in the English word \"cats\" or the Japanese word \"tsunami\" and does not sound at all like /k/ or /s/ by itself. Pinyin uses special marks to show the four Chinese tones, which are very important in speaking Mandarin correctly. == Consonants == b p m f w d t n l g k ng h j q x y z c s == Vowels == a e i o u ü == Basic combinations of vowel and consonant == ai ei ao ou an en ang eng ong == Tones == There are five tones: ā, á, ǎ, à, a == Syllable-dividing mark (geyin fuhao) == Geyin fuhao is used after syllables that start with a, o, or e: pi'ao. == Orthography == Pinyin should be divided text by words and write syllables connectedly. For example, \"I am a foreigner\" should be written as \"Wo shi waiguoren\" in pinyin. == Pinyin reading matters == *Pinyin reading matters from Wikibooks *Pinyin reading matters from Wikimedia == Other websites == *New Edition Hanyu Pinyin Syllable Table * Rules for Hanyu Pinyin * Convert Chinese to Pinyin * Little Pinyin App 1.0 online Category:Romanization of Chinese",
