 "text": "Welcome to Paradise is a song by rock band Green Day. It first appeared on their second album Kerplunk in 1992. A new version appeared on the album Dookie in 1994. ==Song meaning== The song is about young people moving out of their parents' home. The song was written by Billie Joe Armstrong. ==Music video== The music video shows Billie Joe (Green Day's singer) playing a West Oakland citizen who watches a dangerous notoriety caused by a group of thugs then he goes home to watch the citizens and what they do each day. ==Differences between Kerplunk and Dookie version== The Kerplunk version has a slower sound and the Dookie version is more fast-paced and also both versions have slightly different lyrics. The original version of the song from Kerplunk was not a single but the Dookie version was. The album cover for Dookie in fact, shows a comedic depiction of chaos happening in West Oakland. In the booklet for the Dookie album a cartoonish drawing in West Oakland is shown. ==References== Category:Green Day songs Category:1994 songs",
