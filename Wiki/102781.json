 "text": "Rājput or Rajputra (from Sanskrit rājāputrā meaning: son of a king) also called Thakur is a community belonging to the Indian subcontinent. The Rajputs claim to be descendants or members of the Kshatriya (warrior and ruling) class. During the 6th to 12th century, the Rajputs were at the pinnacle of their power and many parts of Northern India were ruled by various Rajput dynasties. ==Origin== They claim descent from various Kshatriya dynasties such as Agnivanshi, Chandravanshi and Suryavanshi. Their origins are also traced back to ancient tribes, with some theories suggesting their origins from the Indo-Aryans or from the Scythians. == Demographics == They are found in the Indian states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujrat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Jharkhand and some parts of Pakistan. == Present scenario == At present the real Rajputs, in all the states of India, are considered a General caste (forward caste). This means that they have no access to reservations in India’s positive discrimination of castes. The Rajputs were regarded as a martial race by the Britishers due to their bravery, courage and rich historical background. This led to the formation of regiments such as the Rajput regiment and the Rajputana Rifles regiment. They were high in number in the armed services of India and at present too this community gives a large number of soldiers to the Indian defence forces.(Army, Navy, Airforce). == Related pages == *Rajput clans *Rajputana Rifles *Maharana Pratap *Thakur ==References== == Other websites == *Rajputcommunity.in a site with hundreds of different post of Rajputs and their clans *Origin of Rajputs * Rajput Vansh and Clans * Rajputs Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition; 2005 * Rajput Encyclopedia Britannica; 1911 * Rajputs in Rajoa, Dadyal * Ek Tha Raja Category:Rajputs Category:Ethnic groups in India Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan",
