 "text": "Amala Ratna Zandile DlaminiFull birth name: * \"Amala Ratna\": and * \"Zandile\": (born October 21, 1995), known by her stage name Doja Cat, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter and record producer. Her father was also a musician. She has written many songs. These include \"Mooo!\", which became an internet meme. Doja Cat's song \"Say So\" went viral on TikTok when a user of the site known as Haley Sharpe created a dance to the song. There was a hiatus from commercial music and the uneventful release of Doja Cat's first studio album, Amala (2018). After that, Doja Cat earned viral success as an internet meme with her 2018 single \"Mooo!\", a novelty song where she fantasizes about being a cow. Her second studio album, Hot Pink (2019), reached the top 10 of the US Billboard 200. The album's single \"Say So\" was at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 after the release of a remix featuring Nicki Minaj. Hot Pink was followed by Planet Her (2021), which spent three. Doja Cat is also well-versed in the internet herself. She is famed for her absurdly humorous personality and online presence. She has received numerous awards throughout her career, including a Billboard Music Award, two American Music Awards and three MTV Video Music Awards. She also earned nominations for three Grammy Awards. == Discography == === Studio albums === * Amala (2018) * Hot Pink (2019) * Planet Her (2021) * Scarlet (2023) === Singles === ==== As lead artist ==== * \"So High\" (2014) * \"Candy\" (2018) * \"Mooo!\" (2018) * \"Tia Tamera\" (2019) == References == == Other websites == * Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters Category:1995 births Category:African-American rappers Category:African-American singers Category:American contemporary R&B; singers Category:American hip hop record producers Category:American hip hop singers Category:American R&B; singers Category:American TikTokers Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:Hindus Category:Jewish American musicians Category:Living people Category:American pop rappers Category:Rappers from Los Angeles Category:Record producers from California Category:Singers from Los Angeles Category:Singer-songwriters from California",
