 "text": "Planes is a 2013 American 3D computer graphicas computer animated movie. Unlike the Cars movies (which were produced by Pixar), Planes was produced by DisneyToon Studios. The movie is a spin-off to the Cars franchise, but it did not receive the kind of success that Cars received. Planes follows a crop- duster plane Dusty Crophopper who, under Skipper's training, becomes a racer in the Wings Around the Globe rally. With a lot of patience, Dusty has to face his racing rival Ripslinger as well as many other natural obstacles that come in his way. The movie was released on August 9, 2013. It had a sequel named Planes: Fire & Rescue, which was released in 2014. A third film titled Beyond the Sky was planned to be released on 12 April 2019, but was removed from the release schedule on 1 March 2018. It was cancelled due to the closure of DisneyToon Studios on 28 June 2018. ==Cast== * Dane Cook as Dusty Crophopper * Walter Keach as Skipper Riley * Cedric the Entertainer as Leadbottom * Roger Craig Smith as Ripslinger * Carlos Alazraqui as El Chupacabra Category:2010s English-language movies Category:Cars (franchise) Category:2013 movies Category:2013 adventure movies Category:2013 comedy movies Category:Disney animated movies Category:2010s American adventure movies Category:American comedy movies Category:2013 computer-animated movies",
