This time was marked by the building and endowment of Buddhist temples, art and gardens.Yiengpruksawan, Mimi Hall. (1998). Hiraizumi: Buddhist Art and Regional Politics in Twelfth-Century Japan,p. 186. Pure Land Buddhism developed a concept of planning and garden design that was unique to Japan. The four Pure Land gardens of Hiraizumi show the ideals of Pure Land Buddhism. The gardens also show Japanese concepts about the relationship between gardens, water and the surrounding landscape. The four gardens were developed by the Ōshū Fujiwara clan. The poet Matsuo Bashō was inspired by this Fujiwara legacy.Miner, Earl (1969). Japanese Poetic Diaries, p. 176. In 1689, Bashō wrote: \"Three generations of glory vanished in the space of a dream ....\"Keene, Donald. (1999). Travelers of a hundred ages, p. 315. In 2011, UNESCO listed parts of Hiraizumi as a World Heritage Site. == Locations == Name Image Location Notes Hiraizumi cultural site Hiraizumi cultural site Hiraizumi cultural site Hiraizumi cultural site Hiraizumi natural site ==Related pages== * List of World Heritage Sites in Japan ==References== ==Other websites== * Hiraizumi City, Hiraizumi - World Heritage * Iwate Prefecture, http://www.pref.iwate.jp/~hp0907/sekaiisan/index.html * http://www.chusonji.or.jp/en/index.html * http://www.motsuji.or.jp/english/index.php Hiraizumi Hiraizumi Category:Iwate Prefecture",
