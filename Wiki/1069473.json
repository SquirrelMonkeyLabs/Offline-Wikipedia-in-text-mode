For people under 14 there was the Young Pioneers, and for under 9 the Little Octobrists. In March 1926 there were 1,750,000 members: 6% of the eligible youth population. It didn't have much political influence but it was important for teaching the values of the CPSU to the younger generation. ==References== Category:Organizations based in the Soviet Union Category:Youth organizations Category:1918 establishments in Russia Category:1991 disestablishments in the Soviet Union",
