 "text": "Phumulani is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing domestic violence and sexual abuse in communities of color throughout Minnesota and globally. == History == Phumulani was founded by Comfort Dondo, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence. Born and raised in Zimbabwe and now residing in Minnesota, Comfort’s struggle with domestic violence was compounded by the inability of women’s shelters in America to provide the language, cultural and societal resources she and her children needed to feel safe and supported. Often, she found herself back in her abuser’s home with no alternative. Now free from the dangerous situation, Comfort wants to make sure women and children of African descent have the cultural resources they need to feel comfortable in sharing their stories and recovering from their experiences. She understands firsthand that individuals who have fled African countries to save their lives often have lasting trauma that needs to be acknowledged and treated holistically to ensure long-term progress. == Meaning of the name Phumulani == Comfort created Phumulani, named for a Zulu word meaning “refuge,” as a way of helping African immigrants and refugees in Minnesota. It is truly a place where survivors of gender-based abuse and violence can find peace and recovery. == Mission of Phumulani == To stop violence and abuse of women and children. Phumulani is a non-profit organization dedicated to preventing domestic violence and sexual abuse in communities of color throughout Minnesota and the nation. By providing culturally-specific resources to women and girls of African descent, we hope to change the cycle of gender-based abuse in the vulnerable populations. == References == Category:Non-profit organizations of the United States Category:Domestic violence",
