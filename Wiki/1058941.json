 "text": "The lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), also called rock sturgeon, is a North American freshwater fish, a species of sturgeon. Like other sturgeons, this species is a bottom feeder and has semi-cartilage bones, a regular shape, and skin having bony scales on the sides and back. The lake sturgeon uses its long snout to move the dirt on the floor of rivers and lakes to eat. Four organs (barbels) are near its mouth to help the sturgeon find ground-based prey. Lake sturgeons can grow to a large size for freshwater fish, getting up to 7.25 ft (2.2 m) long and 240 lb (108 kg). == Related pages == * Beluga (sturgeon) == References == Category:Freshwater fish Category:Acipenseriformes",
