 "text": "Concubinage is the state of a woman in a relationship with a man of higher social status that gives her less rights than a marriage. In most of the cases the man has an official wife and one or more concubines. Concubines have only limited rights of support from the man, and their children have lower status than children born by the official wife or wives; these legal rights distinguish a concubine from a mistress. Historically, the family of a girl were in favour of a concubinage with a mighty man, as it brought economic security. But concubinage could also mean sexual slavery. Historically, sexual relations with concubines, who are known as “those whom your right hands possess” in the Qur'an, was permissible in Islam. However, most modern Muslims believe that Islam no longer permits concubinage and that sexual relations are religiously permissible only within marriage. In the Western world there is no legal status of concubines, as only monogamous marriages are recognized. Any other relationship does not enjoy legal protection; the woman is necessarily a mistress. ==References== * Rosales v.
