 "text": "Puerto Rican poetry refers to poems written by Puerto Rican writers. Puerto Ricans are American citizens. Because of this, Puerto Rican poetry is a part of American poetry. Puerto Rican poetry is also considered part of Caribbean poetry and Latin American poetry. This is because the island is in the Caribbean. It is also because of the cultural and linguistic connection to the region. Puerto Rican poetry is often written in Spanish. However, Puerto Rican poets often use both English and Spanish in the same poem. Sometimes, poets mix Spanish and English words into Spanglish expressions. Themes include: personal identity, cultural heritage, oppression, discrimination, racism, sexism, and Puerto Rican politics. Poems about the island often use images of oceans, rivers, beaches, local foods, and family traditions.
