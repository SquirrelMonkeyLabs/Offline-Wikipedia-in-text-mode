 "text": "The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico () is a non-voting member of the United States House of Representatives who is elected by voters from Puerto Rico every four years and is the only member of the House who serves a four- year term. Because Puerto Rico is not a state, apportionment does not apply to Puerto Rico, which only has one congressional district (Puerto Rico's at-large congressional district) regardless of its population, which is why Puerto Rico has the most populated congressional district in the United States. The current Resident Commissioner is Pablo Hern√°ndez Rivera, who is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP). ==List of resident commissioners of Puerto Rico== ==Election results== ==Notes== ==References== Category:Political office-holders in Puerto Rico *",
