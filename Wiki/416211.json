This channel of tributaries and the main river is called river system. The area that a river system covers is called basin. importance of the upper course of the river The main function of our river In its upper course is Erosion It erodes it Bed and Banks carries large Builders of rocks the landform formed in upper course of a river are v -shaped valley and waterfall. importance of the middle course of the river The main function of a river has more potential and volume then in the upper course the gradient is gentler and Lateral ( sideways ) erosion has widened the channel. This happens in upper stage where river does inward erosion. Meanders are typical landforms found in this stage of the river. Importance of the lower course of the river The volume of water in a river is highest in the lower course. This is a due to the contribution of water from tributaries . River channel is Deep and wide the land around the river is flat energy in the river is at its lowest to load of sediments and deposition occur. ==References== * Category:Rivers",
