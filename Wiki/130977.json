 "text": "The Negev ( ; ) or Negeb () is the southern region of Israel. It is a desert that covers about 60% of the current state of Israel. Only about 10% of the people that live in Israel live there. The Negev has borders with Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the west, the Arabah in the Great Rift Valley in the east, and a line connecting Gaza city to Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea to the north. Beersheba and Eilat are the main cities of the Negev. The Negev incense route was a trade route in the Negev. It connected Arabia to the Mediterranean in the Hellenistic-Roman period.That is, from the death of Alexander through the Roman Empire. The trade led to the development of ancient towns, forts and caravanserai en route, and agricultural development. It was proclaimed as of outstanding universal value by UNESCO in 2005. == References == == Other websites == *Sde Boker archive of articles on the Negev *Israel's Negev Information Site *Photos of Negev Category:Regions of Israel Category:Deserts of Asia Category:World Heritage Sites in Asia",
