 "text": "The Australian Standard Garratt (ASG) was a total of 57 steam locomotives built from 1943 to 1945. After the federal government founded the Commonwealth Land Transport Board (CLTB) in 1939 a recommendation was made to build several types of Garratt for Australian railway networks. The CLTB only authorised the construction of the light type from several Australian builders for service in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. Though they did provide temporary relief to said systems they were found to have several flaws and most were withdrawn in the 1950s. One ASG No. G33 (which never actually served on a government system) is preserved and on display at Newport Railway Museum after working industrial trains. Category:Australian locomotives",
