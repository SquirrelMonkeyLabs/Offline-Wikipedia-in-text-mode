On top of these stripes sits a circular red \"C\", filled with a golden disk. The blue is meant to represent the skies, the gold stands for the sunshine enjoyed by the state, the white represents the snowcapped mountains and the red represents the earth. ==History== The flag was thought up by Andrew Carlisle JohnsonColorado Department of Personnel & Administration (DPA) Division of Information Technologies (DoIT): Colorado State Archives: Symbols & Emblems.

However, the legislature did not specify the size of the \"C\" or the exact shade of blue or red. Because of this, some flags were in slightly different colors and had the \"C\" wholly within the center stripe. On February 28, 1929, the General Assembly added to the statement that the flag would be the same color blue and red as the flag of the United States. On March 31, 1964, the legislature further dictated the diameter of the gold disc to be equal to the center stripe. ==References== Colorado Category:Colorado",
