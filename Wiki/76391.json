They used the original cartoon title card for series 1-2, and the first 13 episodes of series 3 used the claymation-inspired intro. JimJam contains all of the show's 156 episodes and Pingu at the Wedding Party, but it contains the re-dubbed versions of series 1-2, and contains the original version of the special, without the titles and credits. ==Home video releases== ==Reception== Pingu received mostly positive reviews, Common Sense Media rated the show a 4 out of 5 stars stating \"Parents need to know that this claymation series is funny, endearing, and entertaining.
