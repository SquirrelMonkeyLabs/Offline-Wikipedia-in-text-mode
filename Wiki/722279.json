 "text": "An interstellar cloud is a denser-than-average part of the interstellar medium, (ISM). It is matter and radiation in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. An interstellar cloud is formed by the gas and dust particles from a red giant in its later life. The cloud is made of gas, plasma, and dust in our and other galaxies. Its hydrogen can be: *neutral, making it an H I region; *ionized, or plasma making it an H II region; or *molecular (molecular clouds). Neutral and ionized clouds are sometimes also called diffuse clouds. == Sources == Category:Nebulae Category:Hydrogen Category:Red giants",
