 "text": "The FIFA World Cup is the most watched tournament in football (soccer). The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) organises the World Cup every four years. More people watch the World Cup finals than any other sporting event in the world—even more people than the Olympic Games. Brazil is the most successful country in World Cup history, having won the tournament five times The finals tournament is held every four years. In the other years there are only qualifiers (qualifying tournaments) in the six FIFA world regions. These amazing games help to decide which teams will move on. Over 160 national teams play in the qualifying games. The best teams from the qualifying games win a place in the finals. The finals now include 32 teams. Before 1998, only 24 teams were in the finals; starting in 2026, there will be 48 teams in the finals. Many years before each World Cup, FIFA picks the host nation, the country where the finals will be held. Being the host nation means that their team has qualified for the finals tournament automatically and does not need to play any qualifying games. The 32 teams in the finals then play for four weeks, usually between June and July, to decide who the champion (tournament winner) will be. == Results == Years Hosts Winners Score Runner's-up Third place Score Fourth place 1930 Details Uruguay 4 - 2 1934 Details Italy 2 - 1 3 - 2 1938 Details France 4 - 2 4 - 2 1950 Details Brazil 2 - 1 1954 Details Switzerland 3 - 2 3 - 1 1958 Details Sweden 5 - 2 6 - 3 1962 Details Chile 3 - 1 1 - 0 1966 Details England 4 - 2 2 - 1 1970 Details Mexico 4 - 1 1 - 0 1974 Details West Germany 2 - 1 1 - 0 1978 Details Argentina 3 - 1 2 - 1 1982 Details Spain 3 - 1 3 - 2 1986 Details Mexico 3 - 2 4 - 2 1990 Details Italy 1 - 0 2 - 1 1994 Details United States 0 - 0 a.e.t.
