 "text": "The RÃ­o Aloapan tree frog (Exerodonta abdivita) is a frog that lives in Mexico. It lives in rainforests. It lives mostly below 1600 meters above sea level, but scientists have also seen it at 1900 meters above sea level. Scientists used to think this frog was the same as Hyla melanomma, but it is not. This frog is small and has brown spots on its skin. ==Threats== This frog is not endangered, but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where it lives from forests into farms or other things. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
