On the night of 31 December 1944, the Polish Committee of National Liberation was renamed to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland. It was a communist government made to rival the Polish government-in-exile. The government's lands were on the frontlines of the eastern front in which the Soviets and the Poles were fighting the Germans. The war ended in May 1945 with a Polish and Soviet victory. In June, the Provisional Government of National Unity was made (which was one of the first members of the United Nations). Category:1940s in Poland",
