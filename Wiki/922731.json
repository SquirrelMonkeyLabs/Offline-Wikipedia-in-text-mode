Its belly is white. Its middle is green. Its sides are yellow-green. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lives in the trees. Unlike other tree frogs, it lays eggs whether it has rained hard or not. The male frogs hide in plants near the edges of ponds. Then they sing for the female frogs. The female frog lays her eggs in water that is not deep, 600-700 eggs at a time. The eggs hatch after one or one and a half days. The tadpoles are silver-yellow in color. They grow into frogs in 40 to 88 days. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Frogs of North America",
