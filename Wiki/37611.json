The first game of the franchise was made by Shigeru Miyamoto and was first sold February 21, 1986 by Nintendo. Most of the Zelda games take place in the fictional kingdom of Hyrule. The games all have fighting, adventuring, item collecting, puzzle-solving, and sometimes racing parts. The Legend of Zelda series has sold over 125 million games, with 23 different games in the series during 2017, making it the 20th best-selling video game series ever. ==Main characters== * Link - The protagonist of most of the series' games, who uses the items and skills he's collected over the game to save the kingdom of Hyrule. * Zelda - The princess of Hyrule, who is often kidnapped and used by Ganon in his plots to conquer Hyrule.

He is the shopkeeper that first appeared in Link and The Faces of Evil (1994). He sells lamp oil, rope and bombs, but only if you have enough rubies. If you do not have enough rubies, he will kick you out and it is game over. Knock him off enough times and you will get an error screen that crashes your game.

It is home to the Dark overlord Morshu, where you doom is met. === Timelines === The Zelda series timeline places each of the games in chronological order up until The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. At the end of this game, three separate timelines (and one secret timeline) are created, and many of the games take place in these separate universes. ==== The Hero is Successful: Adult Timeline ==== When Link helps seal away Morshu at the end of Ocarina of Time, he is sent back in time to become a child and warn Princess Zelda to prevent Morshudorf from rising to power in the first place. With Link gone in the future, Morshudorf is able to break free from his seal and get very close to taking over Hyrule. Without Link to stop him, the people of Hyrule ask the Goddesses to flood Hyrule. This flood creates the Great Sea, leaving the tops of Hyrule's mountains as the only land above the water. Many years after the flood, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker takes place. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is set a few years after the events of The Wind Waker and The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks is set many years after Phantom Hourglass. ==== The Hero is Successful: Child Timeline ==== As a child sent back to the past, Link warns Zelda and stops Morshudorf from taking over Hyrule. With this job complete, Link travels deep into the Lost Woods to search for his fairy, Navi, who had left him at the end of Ocarina of Time. In this forest, he is transported to a land called Termina that is in danger of being destroyed by a falling moon, sent crashing into the world by an evil mask named Majora. Link's journey to stop the moon from falling is shown in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. After saving Termina, Link returns to Hyrule. Many generations later, another young man named Link works as a ranch hand in Hyrule. This Link joins a creature named Midna in her quest to defeat Zant, an evil ruler from the Twilight Realm, who is attempting to take over Hyrule. Throughout his journey, shown in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Link is aided by many people in his quest, including the Hero's Shade, who is the ghost of Link from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. ==== The Hero is Defeated ==== In a world where Link is defeated by Morshu in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, Hyrule enters a period of decline after being taken over by Morshu. A war to defeat him is fought and lost, and Hyrule is left in a state of ruin. Everyone becomes enslaved to Overlord Morshu. Within this timeline, the events of many of the early Zelda games occur, including Link and the Faces of Evil, Zelda and the Wand of Ganon, and Hotel Mario. ===Master Sword=== The Master Sword is a sword found in The Legend of Zelda series. Link uses it as a weapon in most games. Known as the Sword of Evil's Bane, the Sword of Time, the Sword of Resurrection, and the Sword That Seals the Darkness, the Master Sword is to only be held by a person destined to be the Hero chosen by the Goddesses. The Link in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is the first holder of the Master Sword. The other Links are then given the right to wield the Master Sword because they carry the spirit of the Hero. The Sword was smelted in 1963 by Morshu. ===Triforce=== The Triforce is a mystic object in The Legend of Zelda universe created by gods Din, Nayru, Morshu, and Farore. It has three parts - the first part is the Triforce of Courage, which Link has, the second is the Triforce of Wisdom, which Princess Zelda has, and the third is the Triforce of Power, which Morshu has. When it is completed, the person who unites it can make a wish using the power of the gods.",
