 "text": "The Bourrée is a quick double time dance of French origins. It is similar to a Gavotte, but has a 1 beat anacruis (upbeat), where the gavotte has a 2 beat anacrusis. It often has a rhythm with a strong beat followed by two weaker ones. For example, an accented crochet followed by two quavers. This is called dactylic. Category:Ballroom dances",
