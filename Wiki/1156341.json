 "text": "The National Women's Political Caucus is a progressive, pro-choice, multi- partisan, grassroots membership organization dedicated to identifying, recruiting, training, and supporting women candidates for elected and appointed office. == History == The National Woman's Political Caucus (NWPC) is an organization founded in 1971 by leaders of the women's liberation movement to promote women's participation in government. The group describes itself as a multi-partisan grassroots organization in the United States dedicated to recruiting, training, and supporting women who seek elected and appointed offices at all levels of government. The NWPC endorses female candidates at the state and national level who adhere to the organization's core set of values. An Organizing Convention for the NWPC was hosted in Washington, D.C. from July 10 to 11, 1971. Approximately 324 women were in attendance, representing 27 states and the District of Columbia; attendees included Bella Abzug, Shirley Chisholm, Betty Friedan, Fannie Lou Hamer, LaDonna Harris, Mildred Jeffrey, Florynce Kennedy, Jill Ruckelshaus, and Gloria Steinem. At the founding meeting, Steinem delivered an Address to the Women of America, in which she characterized feminism as a \"revolution\" that meant striving for a society free of racism and sexism; the speech, delivered at the height of the women's movement, became a milestone in U.S. female oratory. == Other websites == *https://nwpc.org/ *https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Womens-Political-Caucus *https://cawp.rutgers.edu/node/2251 *https://law.utexas.edu/farenthold/national/national-womens-political-caucus/ Category:Organizations based in the United States Category:1971 establishments in the United States",
