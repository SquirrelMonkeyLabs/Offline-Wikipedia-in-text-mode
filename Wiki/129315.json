 "text": "The Red Army Faction or RAF (German Rote Armee Fraktion), was one of postwar West Germany's most active and prominent militant left-wing groups. It described itself as a communist \"urban guerrilla\" group engaged in armed resistance, while it was described by the West German government as a terrorist group. The RAF was formally founded in 1970 by Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin, Horst Mahler, Ulrike Meinhof, Irmgard Möller and others. The Red Army Faction operated from the 1970s to 1993, committing numerous crimes, especially in the autumn of 1977, which led to a national crisis that became known as \"German Autumn\". It was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguards—and many injuries in its almost 30 years of existence. It ceased activities in 1993 and disbanded in 1998. One member was arrested in 2024, Daniela Klette.https://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/tidligere- raf-medlem-pagrepet-i-berlin/s/5-95-1668644.
