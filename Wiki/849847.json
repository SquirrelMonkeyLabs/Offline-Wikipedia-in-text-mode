 "text": "The thirty-sixth government of Israel was installed on June 13, 2021. Prime Minister is Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) after Naftali Bennett resigned in June 2022. Bennett later became Alternate Prime Minister of Israel. The Bennett- Lapid Government is an eight-party coalition with a range of political views from right to left. These parties united with one main goal: sending Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (HaLikud) into the opposition. Just 61 members of the 24th Knesset were supporting this government. This was only one over half the total of 120 members. Because the number of supporting Knesset members fell under 60 in June 2022, the government has been caretaking from July 1, 2022 to December 29, 2022. The following eight parties are participating: Party Seats Name (in English) Leader Yesh Atid 17 \"There is a Future\" Yair Lapid Kahol Lavan (Hosen L'Yisrael) 8 \"Blue and White\" (\"Israel Resilience\") Benny Gantz HaAvoda 7 \"Labor\" Merav Michaeli Yisrael Beiteinu 7 \"Israel is Our Home\" Avigdor Lieberman Yamina (HaYamin HeHadash) 6 Yamina / HaYamin HeHadash got 7 seats; one member joins the opposition. \"Rightwards\" (\"The New Right\") Naftali Bennett Tikva Hadasha 6 \"A New Hope\" Gideon Sa'ar Meretz 6 \"Vigour\" Nitzan Horowitz Ra'am 4 \"United Arab List\" Mansour Abbas == References == == Other websites == * Government 36, Knesset website * Government 36, Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website Category:Israeli governments Category:21st-century establishments in Israel Category:2020s in Israel Category:2021 establishments in Asia",
