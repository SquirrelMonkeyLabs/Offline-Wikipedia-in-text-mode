 "text": "Rotting Christ is a Greek black metal band. It was formed in 1987. They are known for being one of the first black metal bands from Greece. They are popular in the European underground metal community. Rotting Christ is also known for making black metal sound different in the early 1990s. == Name problems == Rotting Christ has had many problems because of the name of their band. In 1999, Gary Bauer (a candidate to run for president in the United States) said the band was \"anti-Catholic\" because of their name. Sakis Tolis, the singer for the band, said that \"everyone should have the right to call religions as he/she wants\", and Rotting Christ is just \"one of the many bands that represent the dark side in metal music\". The name has also made the band cancel concerts. In 2005, the singer and guitarist for Megadeth, Dave Mustaine, said he would not play at a Greek concert if Rotting Christ was also playing. In April 2018, Rotting Christ was arrested in Georgia. This was because the government thought they were terrorists because of the band's name. They were let go later, and were able to play at the concert they had in Georgia. == Studio albums == * Thy Mighty Contract (1993) * Non Serviam (1994) * Triarchy of the Lost Lovers (1996) * A Dead Poem (1997) * Sleep of the Angels (1999) * Khronos (2000) * Genesis (2002) * Sanctus Diavolos (2004) * Theogonia (2007) * Aealo (2010) * Κατά τον δαίμονα εαυτού (2013) * Rituals (2016) * The Heretics (2019) == References == Category:Musical groups",
