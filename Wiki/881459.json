 "text": "The metaverse is a network of virtual places that are linked into a virtual universe. It is often described as a future version of the Internet. In the metaverse, customizable avatars and dynamic group experiences will enable a new era of social interaction. Weddings, happy hours, and religious ceremonies are increasingly taking place virtually, with individuals participating regardless of their geographic location, especially in the aftermath of COVID-19. Metaverse members will engage with and purchase digital and real- world apparel, sporting goods, and other items through virtual shopping malls. Virtual try-on software and augmented reality (AR) capabilities that help buyers in various ways are a natural fit for this use case. == Etymology == The word \"metaverse\" is portmanteau word of the words \"meta\" and \"universe\". The term was coined in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson.Grimshaw, Mark (2014). The Oxford Handbook of Virtuality. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 702.
