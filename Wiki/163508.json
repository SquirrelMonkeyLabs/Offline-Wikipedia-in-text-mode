The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title. === Tracklist === 1\\. Gasoline 2\\. Saturn 3\\. Promise Blender 4\\. I Can 5\\. Splinter 6\\. Safe With You 7\\. Paint 8\\. Boundaries 9\\. Shovel 10\\. My Beautiful Robe 11\\. You Thought 12\\. Darn Great Day === Hey You, I Love Your Soul and the More Faithful music video (1998-1999) === Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled Hey You, I Love Your Soul, which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties. === Tracklist === 1\\. Hey You, I Love Your Soul 2\\. Pour 3\\. Scarecrow 4\\.

Because of this change, the musical style on Invincible changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of Invincible in 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position. In late 2000 (several months after Invincible was released), The band released the worship album, and fourth album overall, Ardent Worship. The band kept much of their sound from Invincible on their next studio album Alien Youth. With little time between touring and recording. === Invincible Tracklist === 1\\. Invincible 2\\.

The album was nominated for \"Best Rock Gospel Album\" in 2005. Collide was yet another musical shift for the band.Citing P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on Collide, Cooper said, \"Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like.
