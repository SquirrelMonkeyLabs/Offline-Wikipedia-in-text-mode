 "text": "Tsar Nicholas II abdicated, meaning gave up, being the emperor of the Russian Empire on 2 March (Julian Calendar) / 15 March (Gregorian Calendar), 1917. He did it in the middle of World War I, a very important war that Russia was losing. The war was causing people to be poor and starve, and also millions of young Russians were dying in the war. People blamed Tsar Nicholas for their these problems. This caused the February Revolution, which was what made Tsar Nicholas abdicate. The Emperor gave up the throne for both himself and his son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich. Nicholas said that his brother, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, should be emperor instead. Grand Duke Michael didn't want to take the throne, though. With these events, the rule of the 300-year- old House of Romanov ended. Power in Russia then passed to the Russian Provisional Government, which was a more democratic form of government. == Manifesto of Abdication (Abdication Statement) == Summary Nicholas II said that he wants to give up the throne to his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich because it will help people work together so that Russia will win World War 1. Nicholas II asks the people to be patriotic and help Russia gain victory. The statement ends with a plea to God to help Russia. English Translation of the Manifesto of Abdication Simple English Translation As we fight against our foreign enemies in the World War, God has decided to give us another problem. Chaos from inside our nation, which come from the common people, might lead to us losing the war. If we want the destiny of Russia, the honor of our heroic army, the well-being of our people, and the future of the nation to turn out well, we have to win this war at any cost. Our cruel enemies are already tired, and our army will soon destroy them. In this important time for Russia, we thought it would be best that we help the Russian people work together the best they can so that all our effort can go towards a quick victory. In agreement with the representatives of the people, we have decided that we should give up the throne and stop making decisions for Russia. Since we don't want to be separated from our son (Alexei), we have decided to give the throne to our brother, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. We give him our blessing to be a good Emperor. Our advice to our brother is that he should make decisions with the help and advice of the people's representatives, and also respect the governing groups they have created. In the name of our dearly beloved homeland, we ask our patriotic people to fulfill their holy responsibility to Russia. We ask that they obey the Emperor in this time of trouble, and to help the Emperor, together with the leaders of the people. We ask that they do all this to help the Russian Empire have victory, well-being, and glory. May the Lord God help Russia! ==References== Category:1917 in Russia Category:Russian Revolution",
