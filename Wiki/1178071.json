 "text": "Euriziano is an international auxiliary language (IAL) created by Italian engineer Marco de Grandis in 2024. It was designed to facilitate human communication between citizens of the European Union and to give Europe a common identity language. It is roughly configured as a Latin \"sine flexione\", greatly simplified in grammar and syntax and supplemented by word taken from Esperanto and adapted to express modern terms and neologisms not found in the classical Latin vocabulary. == Alphabet and Phonology == The Eurizian alphabet, consisting of 25 signs, is identical to the Latin alphabet, with the sole addition of the J: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S TU V X Y Z (capital letters); a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v x y z (lower case). The pronunciation of Euriziano corresponds to the classical or 'restituta' pronunciation of Latin, which is completely different from the ecclesiastical pronunciation Upper case A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V X Y Z Lower case a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v x y z IPA phonemes // Slightly aspirated w ks ɥ For the correct pronunciation of Euriziano, the following simple rules must be kept in mind: Only one sound always corresponds to each symbol (a grapheme always corresponds to the same phoneme only). There are no phonic diphthongs and vowels are always pronounced separately just as groups of two consonants are always pronounced separately. The only exceptions are the ph group, which is always read f, and the tch group, which is read c with a sweet sound as ch in English “check”. The group sc always has a hard sound and the group ti is read as written. The diphthongs ae and oe are pronounced as they are written (ae is read ae and oe is read oe). The letters c and g always have guttural sounds k and gh. In contrast to the restrictive pronunciation, v is pronounced as in Italian. The accent always falls on the penultimate syllable. J is a consonant. ==Grammar== Like many constructed IALs, Euriziano has a simple and regular grammar. The main word order is SVO, which removes the need for marking the object of a sentence with accusative case (since the position normally tells what word is the object). The outline of the non-question affirmative sentence in Euriziano is as follows: Subject -> Predicate -> Direct complement -> Indirect complement. In interrogative and exclamatory sentences, complements may precede subject + verb. The following rules apply: 1) The subject must always be expressed and as a rule precedes the verb (the only exceptions are for the verb in the imperative/exhortative mode and inversion is also permitted when direct speech is followed by a verb of saying and the locutor is indicated: ‘I am fine!’ said the father -> ‘ego valet optime!’ inquivit patre). Subject inversion is always used in expressions corresponding to “there is” (hic est) and “there are” (hic sunt) used in all verb tenses. Example: on the table there are many books -> super mensa hic sunt multi libros. 2) The direct complement always follows the verbal predicate directly; 3) The adjective usually immediately precedes the noun to which it refers; 4) The adverb always immediately follows or precedes the verb it refers to; 5) The personal pronoun complement always follows the verbal predicate. In the case of a co-ordinating proposition introduced by et or ac , if the subject performing the action is the same as in the main sentence, the subject may be omitted. Most Eurizian nouns are derived from the corresponding Latin nouns, while terms developed after Roman times are taken from Esperanto. The Eurizian words are obtained from the corresponding Latin or Esperanto terms by means of precise rules of derivation. As far as gender is concerned, in Euriziano nouns are divided into three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter and, unlike Latin and Esperanto, the following rules apply, which do not allow for any exceptions: 1) All proper or common names referring to male persons or animals are masculine; 2) All proper or common nouns referring to female persons or animals, flowers and plants are feminine; 3) All names of inanimate entities and objects (both concrete and abstract) and all those that do not fall under categories 1 and 2 are neuter. As far as number is concerned, the noun can be singular or plural. Unlike Latin, the flexion theory does not apply to the Eurizian noun, and each noun has only two forms: one for the singular and one for the plural. The plural is obtained by simply adding an s to the singular form. As in Latin, the determinative article does not exist in the Eurizian language. The logical function is determined by the position of the noun in the sentence and the prepositions. In fact, the subject always immediately precedes the verb, the object complement always immediately follows the verb and indirect complements are identified by specific prepositions Examples: lupo corresponds to 'the wolf' (singular, subject or object complement); rosa corresponds to 'the rose' (singular, subject or object complement ); lupos corresponds to 'the wolves' (plural, subject or object complement), rosas corresponds to 'the roses' (plural, subject or object complement). In contrast to Latin, in Euriziano there is the indeterminative article une, which is valid for all three genders and precedes the noun: une rosa corresponds to 'a rose' (singular, subject or object complement); une lupo corresponds to 'a wolf' (singular, subject or object complement). ===Personal pronouns=== Subject Personal pronouns Complement Personal pronouns Person Singular Plural Person Singular Plural 1st ego nos 1st me nes 2nd tu vos 2nd te ves 3rd Reflexive se se 3rd Reflexive ses ses Masculine is ili Masculine eum eos Feminine ea ele Feminine eam eas Neuter id ili Neuter id eos Oni is used as a third person impersonal subject referring to a person, in analogy with the use of the French 'On'. Example: one must always tell the truth -> oni debet semper dicere veritate. Reciprocal action is expressed with the adverb invicem (reciprocally). Example: we help each other -> nos adiuvat nes invicem. The subject pronoun 'se' is used in dependent sentences when the third person subject is the same as the subject of the main sentence. The complement pronoun 'ses' is used in the reflexive sense when it refers to the subject of the same sentence (corresponds to he himself, she herself, they themselves). ===Verbs=== In Euriziano, all verbs in the infinitive end in -RE and there is only one verbal conjugation. There are no irregular verbs, with the exception of the verb ESSÈRE (TO BE) whose conjugation differs from the regular conjugation only for the indicative present. The subject of the verb must always be expressed, except in cases where the verb is in the imperative or in exhortative form. In the latter two cases, the subject may be omitted. The subject always precedes the verb and can only be separated from the verb by a negation, an adverb or a relative phrase between two commas. ESSERE (TO BE) is the only verb that acts as an auxiliary. It is in fact used to form the compound tenses of the passive form of transitive verbs. Let's see how to use the modes and tenses of verbs. Indicative Mode: it is a finite verbal mode and expresses the certainty of the occurrence of a fact or an action. It consists of the following tenses: * present indicative: indicates an action or situation taking place at the time of speaking; it corresponds to the English present indicative; * imperfect indicative: indicates an action that takes place in the past with respect to the moment of speaking or writing or a possible condition in the hypothetical period of possibility. In English it can correspond to the simple past (habitual action) or the progressive past (action in progress). * perfect indicative: indicates an action performed in the past with respect to the moment in which one is speaking or writing . In English it corresponds to the simple past * future indicative: indicates an action that has yet to take place with respect to the moment in which one speaks. In English it corresponds to the future indicative * future perfect indicative: indicates events, experiences and facts considered as completed, but which are in the future. In English it corresponds to the future perfect. Conditional Mode: This is mainly used to indicate an event or situation that takes place only if a certain condition is fulfilled. It consists of the following tenses: * present conditional: used to describe situations and habits subordinate to a certain condition; it corresponds to the English present conditional; * past conditional: used to describe situations and events considered only as potential and subordinate to a condition. ; it corresponds to the English past conditional; Exhortative and imperative mode: it expresses an exhortation or a command. Progressive Mode: indicates an action while taking place in the present or in the past or in the future; Imminent Mode: indicates an action that is about to be performed or is intended to be performed in the present or in the past or in the future. Infinitive Mode: is used in objective propositions; Participial mode: is used to form compound tenses: * present participle -> in used to form the progressive mode tenses; * past participle -> in used to form the compound tenses of the passive form; * future participle -> in used to form Imminent mode tenses. Gerund Mode: used to express the nominal form of the verb. === VERB CONJUGATION RULES === In order to conjugate verbs (all of which end in -RE), it is first necessary to identify the root from the infinitive by removing the termination in -RE. For example, the root of the verb AMARE (TO LOVE) is AMA- . Once the root has been identified, the verbs are conjugated as described below. INDICATIVE AND CONDITIONAL MODES - ACTIVE CONJUGATION: Once the root is isolated, the specific temporal suffix is added (for all tenses except the present) and completed by joining the root (for the present) or the suffix (for all other tenses) with the ending -t for all persons. CONJUGATION = ROOT + SUFFIX + T SUFFIX These are characteristic elements that univocally identify the tense to be conjugated according to the following scheme: Tense Suffix Presente Indicative None Present Conditional RE Imperfect Indicative BA Perfect Indicative VI Past Conditional VISSE Future Indicative BI Future Prefect Indicative VERI INDICATIVE AND CONDITIONAL TENSES - PASSIVE CONJUGATION: The passive form of any tense of the indicative and conditional mode is obtained by adding the past participle to the verb to be expressed in that tense. Example: passive imperfect indicative of the verb X -> Imperfect indicative of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) + past participle of the verb X: We were loved -> Nos essebamus amati PROGRESSIVE MODE: the progressive verbal form of a certain tense (Present, Future or Imperfect) is obtained by adding to the verb to be at the same tense indicative the present participle of the verb to be conjugated. Present progressive of the verb X -> Present indicative of the verb Essere (TO BE) + present participle of the verb X. Exemple: Tu es loquenti -> You are talking. Past progressive of the verb X -> Imperfect indicative of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) + present participle of the verb X. Exemple: tu essebat loquenti -> you were talking Future progressive of the verb X -> Future indicative of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) + present participle of the verb X. Exemple: tu essebit loquenti -> you will be talking IMMINENT MODE: the imminent verbal form of a certain tense (Present, Future or Imperfect) is obtained by adding to the verb ESSERE (TO BE) at the same tense the future participle of the verb to be conjugated. Example: Present imminent of the verb X -> Present indicative of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) + future participle of the verb X you are going to talk (or you are about to talk) > tu es loquituri. Past imminent of the verb X -> Imperfect indicative of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) + future participle of the verb X you were going to talk (or you were about to talk) > tu essebat loquituri Future imminent of the verb X ->Future indicative of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) + future participle of the verb X you will be going to talk or you will be about to talk-> tu essebit loquituri EXORTATIVE OR IMPERATIVE MODE: The exhortative or imperative verbal form is obtained in the following way. 2nd person singular: verbal root +S 2nd person plural: verbal root +TE 1st person plural: verbal root +MUS 3rd person singular and plural: ke + subject +present indicative INFINITIVE MODE The present infinitive is the basic form from which the root from which the whole conjugation of the verb is obtained. The past infinitive is obtained by adding the suffix -VISSE to the verbal root. The future infinitive is obtained by adding the suffix - TURI to the verbal root. GERUND MODE The gerund verb is formed by adding the ending -NDO to the verbal root. The gerund is also formed from the adjectival form by replacing the final o with i. Example: AMARE -> AMANDO -> AMANDI meaning 'to love'. Tyrrheno est une amandi mare -> Tyrrhenian is a sea to be loved. NOTE ON THE USE OF PARTICIPLE The use of participle in the present form in Eurizian is very similar to that of English: “Mark, asking his brother for help, solved all the problems” translates as: Marco, roganti auxilio ad sui fratre, solvevit omni quaestiones. The corresponding past form in Eurizian is implemented with the simple past participle: “Marco, having asked his brother for help, solved all the problems” -> Marco, rogati auxilio ad sui fratre, solvevit omni quaestiones. As can be seen, if the subject of the participle is the same as the main sentence, it can be omitted. the present indicative tense of the verb to be, the full conjugation of which is given below, is the only irregular verb in the Euriziano. === Indicative Present of the verb ESSERE (TO BE) === Ego sum Tu es Is,ea, id est nos sumus Vos estis Ili, ele sunt The other tenses of the verb to be follow the regular conjugation. Example I was -> ego essebat The following phrases give examples of the verb in the active form: Grammar English Euriziano Infinitive to protect Protegere Present I protect Ego proteget Present Perfect I have protected Ego protegevit Simple Past I protected Ego protegevit Past Perfect I had protected Ego protegevit Past Continuous I was protecting Ego protegebat, Ego essebat protegendi Future I shall protect or I will protect Ego protegebit Future Perfect I shall have protected or I will have protected Ego protegeverit Future In The Past I was going to protect Ego essebat protegeturi Conditional I would protect Ego protegeret Conditional Perfect I would have protected Ego protegevisset Second Imperative singular protect! proteges! Second Imperative plural protect! protegete! * Present active participle: protegenti – 'protecting' * Past passive participle: protegeti – 'protected' The following phrases give examples of the verb in the passive form: Grammar English Euriziano Infinitive to be protected Essere protegeti Present I am protected Ego sum protegeti Present Perfect I have been protected Ego essevit protegeti Simple Past I was protected Ego essevit protegeti Past Perfect I had been protected Ego essevit protegeti Future I shall be protected or I will be protected Ego essebit protegeti Conditional I would be protected Ego esseret protegeti I would have been protected First Imperative Let me be protected! Second Imperative be protected! --> ===Articles=== In Euriziano there are no determinative articles, while there is only one indeterminative article valid for masculine, feminine, and neuter: une ===Nouns=== Based on their ending, all nouns in the Eurizian language can be classified into three groups: \\- nouns ending in -a -> first group; \\- nouns ending in -o -> second group; \\- nouns ending in -e-> third group. a) Nouns ending in -a (first group) Example: rosa -> the rose (singular form) ; rosas -> the roses (plural form) Let's look at some examples of nouns from the first group in the translation of Eurizian sentences. The rose is the most beautiful flower -> Rosa est flore lemagis pulchri. Roses smell good -> Rosas olet bene. Marco gave Anna a red rose -> Marco donavit une rubri rosa ad Anna. Anna adorned her garden with white roses -> Anna ornabat sui horto cum albi rosas. Nouns ending in -o (second group) Example: lupo -> the wolf (singuar form) ; lupos -> the wolves (plural form) Let's look at some examples of nouns from the second group in the translation of Eurizian sentences. The wolf is a wild animal-> Lupo est feri animale. Wolves live in the woods-> Lupos vivet in silvas. Men fear the wolf-> Homines timet lupo. Lucius was attacked by wolves-> Lucio essevit aggredeti a lupos Nouns ending in -e (Third group) Example: leone -> the lion (singular form) , leones -> the lions (plural form) Let us take a look at some examples of nouns of the third group in the translation of sentences in Euriziano. The lion is considered the king of animals-> Leone est reputati rege de animales. Lions live in the savannah-> Leones vivet in savano. Men fear the lion-> Homines timet leone. The gazelle managed to escape from the lions -> Dorcade possevit evadere e leones. ===Adjectives=== Most Eurizian qualifying adjectives are derived from the corresponding Latin qualifying adjectives modified according to precise rules. If the corresponding Latin qualifying adjective does not exist in Latin, the corresponding Esperanto word is considered and the Eurizian adjective is derived from it according to defined rules. For each adjective, there is only one form valid for the singular and plural and also valid for all three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) . The qualifying adjective in Euriziano is thus invariable and always ends in -i. ===Adverbs=== The adverbs in the Eurizian language are exactly the same as in the Latin language. Magis is used for the comparative and multo for the superlative. Example: slowly -> lente; more slowly -> magis lente; very slowly -> multo lente. For adverbs, the same comparative expressions are used as for adjectives: much more -> multo magis; much less -> multo minus; a little more -> paulo magis; a little less -> paulo minus; ==Vocabulary== All the words in the Eurizian language originate from the vocabularies of two languages: Latin and Esperanto. Therefore, if you have the vocabularies of Latin and Esperanto at your disposal, you can derive any word of the Eurizian language simply by keeping the following rules in mind. The rules of derivation are different for nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions and conjunctions. As far as adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions are concerned, they are exactly those of the Latin language (apart from a few minor variations reported in the specific pages of this site), while pronouns and all adjectives other than qualifying adjectives are derived from Latin according to the definitions given in the adjectives section and the pronouns section of the grammar. As far as nouns, qualifying adjectives and verbs are concerned, the general principle applies that one always starts by looking for the corresponding Latin word and, if it does not exist (as is the case, for example, with neologisms formed after the Roman era), or if it does exist, but is expressed by the combination of two or more words, one goes on to consider the corresponding Esperanto word. === Derivation rules from Latin for nouns === To obtain a given Eurizian noun, we look up the corresponding Latin noun in the English-Latin dictionary. In the Latin dictionary, nouns are indicated by giving the Latin noun in nominative case in full (other than the Eurizian nominative) followed by the final ending of the genitive and the gender (masculine, feminine or neuter abbreviated (m. for masculine, f. for feminine and n. for neuter). Example: if we look up “rose” in the dictionary, we find: rosa, ae, f. where rosa is the nominative, rosae the genitive and f. stands for feminine. What is of interest for the purposes of derivation is the genitive that identifies the Latin declension. In the case of the example, we are interested in the genitive rosae which tells us that the noun belongs to the Latin first declension. In general, the five cases described below can therefore occur. 1) The noun belongs to the Latin first declension (genitive in -ae). we remove -ae from the singular genitive case and we put -a as a termination; thus we obtain an Eurizian noun of the first group (termination in -a). Example: Eglish rose -> in the English-Latin dictionary we find rosa, ae f. . From the Latin genitive rosae, removing the ending in -ae gives the root ros-. If we add the ending -a, we obtain the Eurizian singular noun rosa. Since Eurizian grammar stipulates that the names of plants and flowers are always feminine, the gender in this case of the Eurizian noun will be feminine. In conclusion, in the Eurizian vocabulary we would find: rosa, f. 2) The noun belongs to the Latin second declension (genitive in -i). We remove -i from the singular genitive and we put -o as the ending; we thus obtain an Eurizian noun of the second group (termination in -o). Example: English wolf -> in the English-Latin dictionary we find lupus, i m. . From the Latin genitive lupi, removing the ending in -i gives the root lup-. Adding the ending -o gives the Eurizian singular noun lupo. Since Eurizian grammar stipulates that nouns of masculine animals are always masculine, the gender of the noun wolf in Eurizian will be masculine. In conclusion, in the Eurizian vocabulary we would find: lupo, m. 3) The noun belongs to the Latin third declension (genitive in -is). We remove - is from the singular genitive and we put -e as the ending; we thus obtain an Eurizian noun of the third group (termination in -e). Example: English heart -> in the English-Latin dictionary we find cor, cordis n. . From the Latin genitive cordis, removing the ending in -is gives the root cord-. Adding the ending -e gives the Eurizian singular noun corde. Since Eurizian grammar stipulates that nouns of objects are always neuter, the gender of the noun corde in Eurizian will be neuter. In conclusion, in the Eurizian vocabulary we would find: corde, n. 4) The noun belongs to the Latin fourth declension (genitive in -us). We remove -us from the singular genitive and put -o as the ending; we thus obtain an Eurizian noun of the second group (termination in -o). Example: English fruit -> in the Enlish-Latin dictionary we find fructus, us m. . From the Latin genitive fructus by removing the ending in -us we obtain the root fruct-. If we add the ending -o we obtain the Eurizian singular noun fructo. Since Eurizian grammar stipulates that nouns of objects are always neuter, the gender of the noun fructo in Eurizian will be neuter. In conclusion, in the Eurizian vocabulary we would find: fructo, n. 5) The noun belongs to the Latin fifth declension (genitive in -ei). We remove - ei from the singular genitive and put -e as the ending; we thus obtain an Eurizian noun of the third group (termination in -e). Example: English day -> in the English-Latin dictionary we find dies, ei m. . From the Latin genitive diei, removing the ending in -ei gives the root di-. Adding the ending -e gives the Eurizian singular noun die. Since Eurizian grammar dictates that nouns of objects are always neuter, the gender of the noun die in Eurizian will be neuter. In conclusion, in the Eurizian vocabulary we would find: die, n. Derivation from compound Latin nouns In the case of compound Latin nouns, the corresponding Eurizian noun is obtained in the following way: 1) We consider the two original words joined together; 2) We consider the word obtained from the union as belonging to the latin declension of the second word, 3) The rules of noun derivation are applied to the noun obtained in step 2. Examples: ius iurandum (Latin) -> iusiurando (Eurizian). Meaning: oath; ros marinus (Latin) -> rosmarino (Eurizian). Meaning: rosemary; agri cultura (Latin) -> agricultura (Eurizian). Meaning: agriculture; aquae ductus (Latin) -> aquaedocto (Eurizian). Meaning: aqueduct; terrae motus (Latin) -> terraemoto (Eurizian). Meaning: earthquake. Derivation from indeclinable Latin nouns The noun instar, indeclinable in Latin, is used in Eurizian as a translation of the expression 'in the guise of', 'in the likeness of', always followed by the noun: instar armam -> in the guise of a weapon. The indeclinable Latin noun mane (morning), in Eurizian becomes mane, (mane, manes) with the same meaning: morning; the Latin indeclinable nouns pessum and venum pass unchanged into Eurizian solely as translations of the expressions 'in ruin' -> in Eurizian “in pessum” and 'for sale' -> in Eurizian “in venum”; “ire in pessum” -> to go to ruin. Other Latin indeclinable or defective nouns, apart from those discussed in this paragraph, are not considered. ==== Particular nouns derived from Latin ==== For nouns that in Latin have only the plural (pluralia tantum), the singular form is also used in Eurizian: \\- wealth: (Latin) divitiae, divitiarum -> (Eurizian) divitia \\- Athens: (Latin) Athenae, Athenarum -> (Eurizian) Athena \\- delight: (Latin) deliciae, deliciarum -> (Eurizian) delicia \\- truce: (Latin) indutiae, indutiarum -> (Eurizian) indutia \\- snare: (Latin) insidiae, insidiarum -> (Eurizian) insidia \\- threat: (Latin) minae, minarum -> (Eurizian) mina \\- wedding: (Latin) nuptiae, nuptiarum -> (Eurizian) nuptia Unlike Latin, in Eurizian there are no terms that take on a different meaning depending on whether they are used in the singular or plural form. That is why in Eurizian “abundance” is translated as follows: copia (singular); copias (plural). The noun troop is translated as follows: turma (singular); turmas (plural). In Eurizian letter of the alphabet is translated as follows: littera (singular), litteras (plural). The noun literature is translated as: litteratura (singular), litteraturas (plural). The noun vigil is translated as: vigilia (singular), vigilias (plural). The noun sentinel is translated as: excubitore (singular), excubitores (plural). In Eurizian, the term viscus also has the singular and is translated as: exto (singular), extos (plural). The only term that in Eurizian takes on a different meaning depending on whether it is used in the singular or plural form is the noun “good”. In fact, the good is translated as: bono: the good; while goods understood as substances, riches, are translated as: bonos: goods, substances; In contrast to Latin, in Eurizian we also have that: the castle is translated as: castro ( sing), castros (plu). Camp is translated as: castra (sing.) castras (plu). Aid, help is translated as: auxilio ( sing), auxilios (plu). Auxiliary troop is translated as auxiliari agmine (sing), auxiliari agmines (plu). English noun virus (pathogenic agent) is translated in Eurizian by virio (sing.), virios ( plural). Due to the principle of disambiguity, the Latin term virus should not be considered so as not to create confusion with vir, viri (man). Man (human being of the male gender) is translated as: viro (sing), viros (plu), whereas man, understood as an individual belonging to the human species (male or female), is translated as homine (sing.), homines (plu) of neutral gender. The English word force, power, strenght (lat. vis, roboris) is translated as vire in the singular and vires in the plural. City walls in Eurizian have singular and plural: moene: (singular) ; moenes: (plural) in the singular is used to indicate a section of wall; in the plural, it is used to indicate all the walls of the city. Alps is also used in Eurizian in the plural only: Alpes: the Alps. Unlike in Latin, in Eurizian we have that: English prison translates as: carcere (sing); carceres ( plu) English gate is translated by: cancello (sing), cancellos (plu) English End (final outcome) is translated by: fine (sing.), fines ( plu) English border: confino (sing.), confinos (plu). In order to avoid ambiguity with the derivation from the Latin word mare, maris (sea), male noun term is translated into Euriziano as masko (sing), maskos ( plu). Republic is translated as respublica (sing.), respublicas (plu.) ; State (as institution) is translated by stato (sing.), statos (plu.). === Rules for deriving nouns from Esperanto === Nouns that were produced by the evolution of civilisation after classical Roman times and therefore do not exist in Latin are obtained in Eurizian from the corresponding noun Esperanto. Thus, if the corresponding noun is not found in the English-Latin vocabulary, the English- Esperanto vocabulary is considered and the following procedure is applied. We consider the noun Esperanto transliterated in the Eurizian alphabet according to the following transformation rules: esperanto letter eurizian letter esperanto letter eurizian letter a a k k b b l l c z m m ĉ c n n d d o o e e p p f f r r g g s s ĝ g ŝ sc h h t t ĥ h u u i i ŭ u j j v v ĵ j z z The Eurizian noun thus obtained by transliteration always ends in -o (second group) and the plural is obtained by simply adding the s. Example follows English: fridge -> Esperanto: fridujo -> Eurizian: fridujo (sing.), fridujos (plu) Feminine nouns that in Esperanto end in -ino turn the termination in Eurizian into -ina. Example: Esperanto : doktorino (female doctor) -> Eurizian : doktorina (first eurizian declension ). ==Language sample for comparison== Here is the Lord's Prayer in Euriziano and several related languages: Eurizian version: Esperanto version: English version: Latin version: Nostri Patre, quem es in caelos, ke tui nomine est sanctificati, ke tui regno venit ke tui voluntate est faceti sicut in caelo et in terra. Das hodie nostri cotidiani pane ad nes et dimittes nostri debitos ad nes sicut nos dimittet eos ad nostri debitores et non induces nes in temptatione sed liberas nes a malo. Amen. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, t hy kingdom come, t hy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen . ==External link== * Euriziano: a common language for Europe * Omniglot the online encyclopedia of writing systems & languages * https://conlang.fandom.com/wiki/EURIZIANO Category:Constructed languages",
