Chihuahuas can have a long or short coat, and come in many different colors. They only need grooming once a week if they have a short coat or it may be twice if they have a long coat. == Origins == The Chihuahua's start goes back to Mexico as the descendants of the Techichi, a short haired and silent dog. The Techichi was liked by the Toltec people, one of the indigenous (original) people of Mexico. Chihuahuas are believed to have been made by breeding the Techichi and Chinese Crested Dogs (a type of small hairless dog) to form today's Chihuahuas. Another possible start for Chihuahuas was the breeding of Techichis with Phalène terriers, which were well liked at the time and were known for their small body and black and tan colors. Mating with another type of dog increased the loudness of the Techichi's bark while making it smaller. Chihuahuas were named after the Chihuahua state in Mexico. The word Chihuahua comes from the Na'huatl word for \"between two waters\" and the name is older than the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. ==References== Category:Dog breeds Category:FCI breeds",
