 "text": "The East End of London, known locally as the East End, generally means the area of central London, England, east of the medieval walled City of London and north of the River Thames. It is poorer and is cheaper to live in than the West End, so it has had many immigrants over the years, including Huguenot, Irish, Jews and more recently Bengalis. Category:Areas of London",
