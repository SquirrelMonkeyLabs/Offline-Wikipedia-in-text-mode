After graduating from Shutoku High School, he joined Japan Soccer League club Honda in 1987. He was the top scorer of the league in the 1990–91 season. He moved to Yomiuri (later Verdy Kawasaki, Tokyo Verdy) in 1991. The club won the league champions in 1991–92 and 1991 JSL Cup. In 1992, Japan Soccer League was folded and the club joined new league, J1 League. Kitazawa, together with his teammates Kazuyoshi Miura, Ruy Ramos, Nobuhiro Takeda, Tetsuji Hashiratani and Bismarck made in the early 1990s the golden era of Verdy who won the J1 League championship (1993 and 1994) and J.League Cup (1992, 1993, and 1994). He finished his playing career as a Verdy player in 2002. Kitazawa was capped 58 times and scored 3 goals for the Japan national team between 1991 and 1999. He made his international debut on June 2, 1991 in a friendly against Thailand, under national manager Kenzo Yokoyama. He was a member of the Japan team for the 1992 Asian Cup that Japan won. He took part in Japan's unsuccessful campaign to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. He was a member of the Asian final qualification stage that was held centrally in Doha and played two games. He was on the bench when the Iraqi's injury-time equaliser dashed Japan's qualification hope in the last qualifier, in the match that the Japanese fans now remember as the \"Agony of Doha\" (ドーハの悲劇). Kitazawa was short-listed for the 1998 World Cup, but national manager Takeshi Okada dropped him along with Kazuyoshi Miura and Daisuke Ichikawa at the final training camp in Nyon, Switzerland. Kitazawa represented Japan national futsal team in the 1989 Futsal World Championship hosted by the Netherlands. ==Statistics== |- |1987–88||rowspan=\"4\"|Honda||rowspan=\"4\"|JSL Division 1||0||0||||||0||0||0||0 |- |1988–89||7||0||||||0||0||7||0 |- |1989–90||22||4||||||0||0||22||4 |- |1990–91||22||10||||||1||0||23||10 |- |1991–92||Yomiuri||JSL Division 1||20||2||5||0||4||1||29||3 |- |1992||rowspan=\"9\"|Verdy Kawasaki||rowspan=\"9\"|J1 League||colspan=\"2\"|-||2||2||11||1||13||3 |- |1993||35||6||3||2||1||1||39||9 |- |1994||40||9||2||1||3||1||45||11 |- |1995||40||11||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||43||11 |- |1996||28||4||5||2||15||5||48||11 |- |1997||29||1||2||0||0||0||31||1 |- |1998||34||5||3||0||0||0||37||5 |- |1999||28||4||3||2||3||1||34||7 |- |2000||4||0||0||0||1||0||5||0 |- |2001||rowspan=\"2\"|Tokyo Verdy||rowspan=\"2\"|J1 League||23||0||0||0||0||0||23||0 |- |2002||4||1||0||0||2||0||6||1 336||57||28||9||41||10||405||76 336||57||28||9||41||10||405||76 |} Japan National Football Team Database |- |1991||2||0 |- |1992||11||1 |- |1993||4||0 |- |1994||7||1 |- |1995||14||1 |- |1996||5||0 |- |1997||11||0 |- |1998||3||0 |- |1999||1||0 |- !Total||58||3 |} ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Tokyo Prefecture Category:Japan international footballers Category:J1 League players Category:Japan Soccer League players Category:Honda FC players Category:Tokyo Verdy players Category:1995 King Fahd Cup players Category:1992 AFC Asian Cup players Category:AFC Asian Cup-winning players",
