 "text": "Christopher Stewart (born 27 March 1951) is an English musician and writer. He was the first drummer for rock band Genesis. He is now a writer and a farmer. Stewart went to school with Tony Banks, Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford, and Anthony Phillips. The five of them formed a band called Anon. This band eventually became Genesis in January 1967. Stewart appears on the band's first two singles, \"The Silent Sun\"/\"That's Me\" and \"A Winter's Tale\"/\"One-Eyed Hound\". Stewart was asked to leave the band in the summer of 1968 because he was not skilled enough. He was replaced by John Silver. After traveling and working throughout Europe, Stewart settled and bought a farm named \"El Valero\" in Andalusia, Spain. He is now better known for his autobiograpical books: Driving Over Lemons: An Optimist in Andalucia (1999, ) and the sequels, A Parrot In The Pepper Tree () and The Almond Blossom Appreciation Society (2006, ). They are all about his work farming in Spain. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website *Biography and news * Category:British autobiographers Category:English drummers Category:Genesis members Category:English writers Category:1950 births Category:Living people",
