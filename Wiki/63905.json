 "text": "A bandana is a triangular or square piece of cloth tied around the head, face or neck. It can be used for protection or decoration. It was made by Middle eastern and south Asians in the city Kashmir. They were wearing it as a symbol of love between the Middle East and South Asia. == History == The word \"bandana\" is thought to derive from the Sanskrit word “badhnati”, meaning “to bind” or “to tie.” The term traveled through Portuguese as “bandannoe” before being anglicized to \"bandana\" in the mid-eighteenth century. Early bandanas were introduced to Europe through colonial trade from South Asia and the Middle East, gaining popularity in Western cultures by the late 17th century. Bandanas were made from cambric, a plain-woven cotton fabric, although silk versions were also common. ==References== Category:Accessories Category:Headgear",
