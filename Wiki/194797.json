 "text": "In applied mathematics, a branch of mathematics, mathematical physics refers to the knowledge made up of equations and ideas which scientists look to for assistance in modeling, describing, or solving problems in physics or related areas. These equations and ideas are derived from areas of pure mathematics. The equations form a consistent structure. An example of a so-called structure is a noncommutative space. == Teachers of mathematical physics == There are many teachers that specialize in mathematical physics, one is Edward Witten, pictured here. == Practitioners of mathematical physics == Practitioners includes those who develop and apply mathematical physics. * von Neumann == Associations of mathematical physics == There are several organized associations in mathematical physics, one is the International Association of Mathematical Physics. ==Related pages== * Physics links == Notes == == References == * \"Mathematical physics\", Robert Geroch, Publisher University of Chicago Press, 1985 == Other websites == * Journal of Mathematical Physics * International Association of Mathematical Physics * Mathematical Physics Electronic Journal Category:Applied mathematics Category:Physics",
