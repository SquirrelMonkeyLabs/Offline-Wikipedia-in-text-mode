 "text": "The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship, also known as UEFA Euro 2024 or simply Euro 2024, was the 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship. Germany was hosting the tournament. It took place from 14 June to 14 July 2024. Spain won the tournament against England, winning their 4th title. ==Historical background== It would be the third time that the matches are played on German territory and the second time in reunified Germany. The former West Germany hosted the tournament of 1988. Four matches of the multi- national Euro 2020 were played in Munich. However, it would be the first time the match is held in the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city. Italy are the defending champions going into the tournament. They have beaten England on penalties in the 2020 final. ==Bid process== On 8 March 2017, UEFA announced that only two countries, Germany and Turkey, had announced their intentions to host the tournament before the deadline of 3 March 2017. The host was selected on 27 September 2018 in Nyon, Switzerland. Voting results Country Votes 12 4 Did not vote 1 Total 17 The UEFA Executive Committee voted for the host in a secret ballot, with only a simple majority (more than half of the valid votes) required to determine the host. In the event of a tie, the UEFA President would cast the decisive vote. Of the twenty members of the Executive Committee, two were ineligible to vote and one was not there, leaving a total of seventeen voting members. ==Qualification== As hosts, Germany qualified for the tournament automatically. The 23 remaining spots will be determined through qualifying, with the group stage taking place from March to November 2023, and the play-offs linked with the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League in March 2024. The qualifying draw is expected to take place in Hamburg in December 2022. ===Qualified teams=== Team Qualified as Qualified on Previous appearances in tournament Hosts 14 ('1968,'1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020) ==Venues== Germany had a wide choice of stadia that satisfied UEFA's minimum capacity requirement of 30,000 seats for European Championship matches. Nine venues used at the 2006 FIFA World Cup were selected: Berlin, Dortmund, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt and Gelsenkirchen. Düsseldorf, which was not used in 2006 but had previously been used for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988, will serve as a 10th venue; conversely, Hanover, Nuremberg and Kaiserslautern, host cities in 2006, will not be used for this championship. Many other stadiums, such as those in Bremen and Mönchengladbach were not selected. The venues covered all the main regions of Germany, but the area with the highest number of venues at UEFA Euro 2024 is the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with four of the 10 host cities (Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Gelsenkirchen and Cologne).
