Helgoland's design was an improvement on the earlier Nassau class. One change was adding bigger main guns. Construction began on 11 November 1908 at the Howaldtswerke shipyards in Kiel. Helgoland was launched on 25 September 1909 and was commissioned on 23 August 1911. Helgoland saw some action against Britain's Royal Navy during World War I. The ship was part of the I Scouting Group in the North Sea. She also served in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy, including the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. Helgoland was at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916. She was given to Great Britain at the end of the war and broken up for scrap in the early 1920s. Her coat of arms is now in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden. == Other websites == ==References== Category:Warships Category:German Empire *[c.]: circa",
