 "text": "Professional wrestling, pro wrestling is wrestling done as performance art. It is different from other sports because it is a fixed sport. It is sometimes known as sports entertainment. Like other athletes, most wrestlers train each day to maintain their physical condition. They practice for years to learn to execute moves safely while still making them look dangerous. They suffer many injuries, sometimes severe. Professional wrestling is done as a show, like a play. Many wrestlers will wrestle in many fights, called matches. They wrestle inside a 'wrestling ring', which is a place with ropes around it. The best wrestlers can win belts, called 'championship titles', to show that they are the best. Famous stars of the ring include \"Gorgeous George\" Wagner, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, Andr√© the Giant, Sting, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Mick Foley, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and John Cena.
