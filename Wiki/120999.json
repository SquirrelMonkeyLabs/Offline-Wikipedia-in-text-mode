 "text": "Art rock (also sometimes called progressive rock or classical rock) is a sub- genre of rock music that has \"experimental influences\". It tries to make rock music into art instead of just entertainment. It often uses longer songs than other genres of rock. It uses different techniques such as elements (parts) of classical music. It is not usually music to dance to, but music to just listen to. It started in the 1960s. Phil Spector (an American music producer) and Brian Wilson (the leader of The Beach Boys) are two early examples of musicians making art rock. The genre was popular with British bands at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. ==Relationship with progressive rock== Art rock is often the same as progressive rock, especially for bands in the 1970s. Allmusic says that progressive rock and art rock are almost the same; both describe rock music that is more artistic. The term \"Progressive rock\" became more popular to talk of the genre of rock music. Art rock is often to describe bands that are harder to define. Princeton University's Wordnet dictionary says that \"progressive rock, art rock\" are \"a style of rock music that [came out] in the 1970s; associated with attempts to [mix] rock with jazz and other forms.\" It also says that it is meant \"for listening and not dancing\".Art rock definition. wordnet.princeton.edu.
