 "text": "Jeremiah Goodman (October 22, 1922 â€“ September 7, 2017) was an American illustrator. He was born in Buffalo, New York. Goodman signed his work with his first name only. Goodman used his unique painting style to create the essence of a building's interior. His painting interprets the plans of both architects and interior designers. He paints original portraits of spaces for both commercial and private clients. For almost twenty years he created the covers for Interior Design magazine, and also books on interiors and for murals. Goodman died on September 7, 2017 of complications from pneumonia in New York City at the age of 94. ==References== ==Other websites== *The official website of Jeremiah Goodman *The official website of Dean Rhys- Morgan, independent curator of works by Jeremiah Goodman Category:1922 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Disease-related deaths in New York City Category:American illustrators Category:Artists from New York City Category:People from Buffalo, New York",
