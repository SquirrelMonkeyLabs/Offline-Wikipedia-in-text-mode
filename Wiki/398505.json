 "text": "Sterilization is the removal of all microbes, commonly practiced in medicine. For example, dipping an object in boiling water, heating using a flame, or pasteurizing something are forms of heat sterilization. Pure alcohol at colder temperatures or even steam can be used instead of hot water. Chemicals can be used, and this is called chemical sterilization. If something is sterile it means it is without germs or foreign life. Medical instruments (tools) that have undergone sterilization can be maintained in sterile condition by keeping them in sealed packaging until use. Category:Microbiology",
