Paul Getty Museum No. 83.AL.257.9, CARC:T561]] Prince Stanisław Poniatowski (1754–1833) was a a wealthy Polish nobleman. He inherited approximately 154 antique gems from his uncle, King Stanisław August Poniatowski of Poland, who died in 1798. He then commissioned gems to be made, to look similar to those he had inherited. He was given more than 2,600 engraved gems. When he died in 1833, it became clear that the gems were forgeries. At first, people had thought that they were real classical pieces. In 1839, they were sold at an auction. That auction was a failure. Today, the gems have been scattered, and many have been lost. Those that remain are seen as good examples of neoclassical carving. These gems are known as Poniatowski gems today. == References == Category:Art Category:Forgeries",
