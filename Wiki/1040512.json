 "text": "The Sahai bush frog (Raorchestes sahai) is a frog. It lives in India. People have seen this frog in a forest where the trees grew close together, near the Noa Dihing River. The frog was inside a hole in a tree that had water in it. People have seen this frog sitting on grass in a swamp. People have seen this frog between 600 and 1200 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes do. Scientists think this might be the same frog as R. parvulus but they are not sure. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
