 "text": "The Ford Taurus was a car produced by Ford Motor Company from 1986 through 2006. In 2008 Ford sold a rebadged Ford Five Hundred as the Taurus. They also renamed the Ford Freestyle crossover CUV as the “Taurus X”. These cars were produced through the 2015 model year. For 2016 Ford showed a new luxury version of the Taurus. But this version was only sold in China. Ford ended production of the Taurus shortly after due to falling sales and increased demand for crossover models and SUV's. ==Versions== The Ford Taurus has had several different changes to the way it was built. Each different version is called a Generation.
