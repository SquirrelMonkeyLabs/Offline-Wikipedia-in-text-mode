 "text": "DJM Records was Dick James's record label, distributed by Pye Records in the UK and various others around the world. DJM is an abbreviation of Dick James Music. Elton John was very prominent in DJM (except in the US and Canada, where he was signed to MCA Records) before moving in 1976 to his own Rocket Records. The very first release on this label was by Dave Sealy entitled It Takes A Thief which was adapted from a television series theme song for which lyrics were written. It was recorded with the Zack Laurence orchestra. Frank Neilson was A&R; manager from 1976 to 1979, before moving to Polydor Records. Other acts on the label in the 1970s included Mr. Bloe, who included pianist Zack Laurence and harmonica player Harry Pitch; former Fleetwood Mac member Danny Kirwan, who recorded three albums for DJM, Second Chapter (1975), Midnight In San Juan (1976), and Hello There Big Boy! (1979); The Tremeloes, after their departure from CBS/Epic in 1974; singer-turned-actor Dennis Waterman; Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson; and various session musicians who had worked with Elton John. The latter sued the label in the 1980s over the rights to his earlier (pre-1976) work. Roger Hodgson, before joining Supertramp, released a single on DJM (Congress in the U.S.) under the name \"Argosy\". After Dick James's death in 1986, PolyGram acquired the DJM catalogue.
