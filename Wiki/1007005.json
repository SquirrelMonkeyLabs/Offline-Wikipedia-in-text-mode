 "text": "Beothuk is a Canadian First Nation group in Newfoundland. It was the first and only First Nation group to be extinct. By 1500 CE, the Beothuk culture had developed. When people first moved from Labrador to modern-day Newfoundland about the year 1 CE, this might have been their most recent cultural expression. Three previous cultural periods, each lasting roughly 500 years, were experienced by the group's forefathers. Category:First Nations",
