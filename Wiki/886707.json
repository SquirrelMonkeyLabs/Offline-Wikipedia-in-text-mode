 "text": "The second inauguration of Woodrow Wilson as the 28th president of the United States happened privately on March 4, 1917, and publicly on the next day, March 5, 1917. It was the start of the second and final term of Woodrow Wilson as president and Thomas R. Marshall as vice president. Two inaugural ceremonies happened because March 4, 1917, was on a Sunday. The first ceremony was done at the President's Room inside the United States Capitol, and the second ceremony was done at the East Front of the United States Capitol Building. The event was the 33rd presidential inauguration. Chief Justice Edward D. White administered the oath of office to Wilson. Willard Saulsbury Jr. administered the vice presidential oath of office to Coolidge. At the same time of the inauguration, women were protesting outside the White House, demanding that women get the right to vote. However, there were groups of men that attacked these protesters. There was more coverage of the altercation than that of the inauguration itself.Defending The Ballot Box (audio interview with Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law) ==References== ==Other websites== *Text of Wilson's Second Inaugural Address Category:1910s in the United States Category:Woodrow Wilson Wilson, Woodrow Category:March events Category:1917 in the United States",
