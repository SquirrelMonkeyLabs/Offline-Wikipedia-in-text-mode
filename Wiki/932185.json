 "text": "Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) is a fluorocarbon. It has the chemical formula C2F4. It is a colourless and odourless gas. It is used to make polymers like Teflon and ETFE. It is suspected to cause cancer. ==Production== Production of tetrafluoroethylene starts from chloroform. First, the chloroform is reacted with hydrogen fluoride to make chlorodifluoromethane. Chlorodifluoromethane gives tetrafluoroethylene when heated. ==References== Category:Organofluorides",
