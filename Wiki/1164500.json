 "text": "Animutation is a style of Flash animation, created accidentally by Neil Cicierega, at the age of 13. This style is characterized by numerous random images from pop culture, usually with foreign music in the background. It's common to use subtitles that aren't a translation of the background music or lyrics, but are actually a soramimi. This type of animation is strange, random, sometimes insane, but it's quite easy to implement, from the point of view of a flash creator. Any kind of rigor and/or professionalism is somehow not necessary in this style of flash animation. It is believed that the first Animutation ever created was the \"Japanese Pokérap\", by Neil Cicierega. From here, Neil created a very varied series of Animutations, such as “Hyakugojyuuichi!!!”, “The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny” or “Untitled”. Thanks to the unexpected success of Neil's flashes, other admirers of his work adapted his Animutations. Originally, these fan-made Animutations were called Fanimutations as a tribute to Neil's animations, but the two concepts quickly became confused. == Animutations characters == * Adolf Hitler * Bill Gates * Colin Mochrie * Darth Vader * George W.
