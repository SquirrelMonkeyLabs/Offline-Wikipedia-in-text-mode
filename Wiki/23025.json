He also wrote the children's book Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1964. Fleming was born in London to a wealthy family. He was educated at Eton College. He spent many years working in Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War. During this time, Fleming helped with the planning and management of two British intelligence units. This experience along with his work in journalism provided much of the background to the stories in his James Bond novels. Fleming wrote his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952. Because of the book's success, Fleming wrote eleven more novels and two collections of short-stories about the British secret agent. In total, there have been twenty-six films based on Fleming's famous character. The twenty-sixth, Spectre, was released in October 2015. Fleming died on 12 August 1964 of a heart attack in Canterbury, Kent, aged 56. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:English novelists Category:James Bond writers Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Writers from London",
