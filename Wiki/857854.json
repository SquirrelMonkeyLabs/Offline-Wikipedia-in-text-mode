It was less formally known as Montreal High School and from 1853 to 1870 was called the High School of McGill College, or the High School Division. The school closed in June 1979, because of a decline in the English-speaking population.Gary Caldwell, Eric Waddell, The English of Qu√©bec: from majority to minority status (1982), p. 89 ==References== Category:Schools in Canada Category:High schools Category:Organizations based in Montreal Category:1979 disestablishments in North America",
