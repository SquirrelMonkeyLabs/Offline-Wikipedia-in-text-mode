 "text": "Pincers are a hand tool used in many situations where a mechanical advantage is required. They are used to pinch, cut or pull an object.Use and care of handtools and measuring tools (Washington, DC: Department of the Army, 1960), p. 178 Pincers are first-class levers. Pincers differ from pliers in that the concentration of force is either to a point, or to an edge at a right angle to the handle of the tool. This allows pincers to be brought close to a surface. This is often helpful when removing nails from wood. Pincers are often called end-nippers or end-cutters. Carpenter's pincers are very well suited to these tasks. Pincers are primarily used for removing objects out of a material. Pincers, often red-hot, have been used as an instrument of torture since the middle ages or earlier. Pliers are a similar tool with a different type of head used for squeezing, rather than cutting and pulling. == References == Category:Cutting tools",
