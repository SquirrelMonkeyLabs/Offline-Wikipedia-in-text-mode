 "text": "An interest rate is how much interest is paid by borrowers for the money that they borrow. It is usually a percentage of the sum borrowed. So, a simple 10% interest means that if one borrows $100, one pays back $110. Interest rates in a country are usually guided by a base rate set by its central bank. The interest rate to businesses and citizens is always above the base rate . Category:Finance",
