 "text": "The British Rail Class 77, also known as Class EM2, is a class of 1.5 kV DC, Co-Co electric locomotive. They were built by Metropolitan Vickers in 1953â€“1954 for use over the between Manchester and Sheffield. These were the bigger and more powerful version of the Class 76 (EM1) to haul passenger trains. Once the Woodhead Line lost passenger trains, all of the Class 77s were sold to Nederlandse Spoorwegen. They would serve in the Netherlands for 15 more years until being retired. Three are now preserved. One stayed in the Netherlands, while the other two has since returned to the UK. == Background == When the London and North Eastern Railway started electrifying the in the late 1930s, they planned to have a total of 88 electric locomotives. Nine of these were planned to be used on express trains. In 1939, the project was halted because of the Second World War. In 1944, the LNER decided to make changes to the project to save money. They decided to use only the EM1 (later Class 76) mixed-traffic locomotives. There were doubts about the EM1s being instable at high speeds. This lead to another change to the project later in the late 1940s. 27 express passenger locomotives were ordered. These would become the Class EM2, and would be used alongside the 58 EM1s. As the Woodhead Line electrification was becoming more expensive, in 1950, the order for the EM2s was reduced to seven locomotives. To make up for the loss, the last ten of the smaller EM1s were fitted with to make them suitable for passenger trains. == Service in the UK == The seven EM2s were built by in 1954. Metropolitan Vickers provided the electrical equipment. It was said that the EM2s were too heavy and outdated by the time they entered service. Despite this, the EM2s faired well in service. All seven locomotives were named after Ancient Greek and Roman goddesses (see below). Like the smaller EM1s, the Class EM2s at first were painted black. This was later changed to dark green from 1956. Then light blue, the same shade worn by AC-current electric locomotives, was applied to the EM2s in the 1960s. In January 1967, the published a report. It proposed the end of electric-hauled passenger trains over the Woodhead Line and divert them to the unelectrified . It was claimed that these trains get in the way of freight trains and required specialised locomotives, referring to the Class EM2s. This lead to all seven locomotives being taken out of service on 2 March 1968. They were then stored at Bury depot. == Further use in the Netherlands == In 1969, the entire class was sold to Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS). They were shipped to the Netherlands in September of that same year. They became the Class 1500. They were modified to suit the NS. This included replacing the steam boiler that was used to heat the carriages with an electrical generator. They were adapted to right-hand driving found in the Netherlands, as opposed to left-hand driving in the UK. The traction motors were refreshed so that they could output more power, but at a lower speed at . Six reentered service with the NS from 1970 to 1971. The seventh, No.27005, was taken apart to provide spare parts for the other six locomotives. The Class 1500s were employed on passenger trains from Amsterdam to Heerlen, and between Maastricht and Venlo. Four of them remained in use until their retirement on 14 June 1986. Three are now preserved. ==Fleet details== Key: Preserved Scrapped BR number BR number NS number Name Disposal 1955 1957 NS number Name Disposal 27000 E27000 1502 Electra Preserved at 27001 E27001 1505 Ariadne Preserved at the in Manchester 27002 E27002 1506 Aurora Scrapped (February 1985) 27003 E27003 1501 Diana Preserved in the by Werkgroep 1501 27004 E27004 1503 Juno Scrapped (October 1986) 27005 E27005 - Minerva Used for parts by NS.
