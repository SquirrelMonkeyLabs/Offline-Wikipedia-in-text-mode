 "text": "The Australia Cup, formerly called the FFA Cup, is an Australian soccer knockout cup competition held every year. It is organised by Football Australia. It is different to the national league competition, the A-League Men, which also happens every year. The Australia Cup has more teams, and it is the only time that A-League clubs can play official matches against lower- ranked clubs, because the Australian soccer league system does not have relegation. Since 2021, the winner of the Australia Cup qualifies for one of the play-off spots for the next years' AFC club competitions (the AFC Champions League for 2022, the AFC Cup for 2023-24 and the AFC Champions League 2 for 2024-24 onwards), unless Wellington Phoenix are the winner. The reason Wellington Phoenix cannot qualify for any of these competitions is because the club is based in New Zealand, which is a member of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), while Australia is a member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The most successful team at the Australia Cup is Adelaide United. The current champions are Sydney FC, who defeated Brisbane Roar in the 2023 final. ==Format== The Australia Cup is a 32-team knockout competition. Professional, semi-professional and even community clubs are all able to qualify. Of the 32 qualifying slots, 10 are given to the 12 A-League Men clubs. The rest are given to clubs who play on the state and territory level. New South Wales is given six slots (four for Football NSW clubs and two for Northern NSW Football clubs, because the state has two federations), while Victoria gets five, Queensland gets four, Western Australia and South Australia get two each and Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory each get one. ===Lists of clubs=== ====2023==== A-League Men clubs Adelaide United
