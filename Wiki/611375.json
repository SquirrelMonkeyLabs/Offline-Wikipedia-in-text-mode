 "text": "Charles Robert Jenkins (February 18, 1940 â€“ December 11, 2017) was a former United States Army soldier. He lived in North Korea from 1965 to 2004 after deserting from his unit and crossing the Korean Demilitarized Zone. He was born in Rich Square, North Carolina. On November 3, Jenkins pleaded guilty to charges of desertion and aiding the enemy, but denied making disloyal or seditious statements - the latter charges were dropped. He was sentenced to 30 days' confinement, received a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and benefits and was reduced in rank to E-1 private (the lowest rank in the US Army). He was released six days early, on November 27, 2004, for good behavior. On July 15, 2008, Jenkins obtained permanent residency status in Japan, just half a month after he applied for the status. Jenkins died in Sado, Niigata on December 11, 2017 of heart failure, aged 77. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Military people from North Carolina",
