The ceremony was hosted by Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes. It was the first ceremony since the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 to have multiple hosts. CODA became the first-ever Best Picture winner in the Academy's history to be made by an internet streaming service (in this case, Apple TV+). The movie won two other awards, Best Supporting Actor for Troy Kotsur and Best Screenplay for its writer and director, Sian Heder. Dune won six awards. Zack Snyder's Justice League won the first ever Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the Oscars Fan Favorite Award. During the ceremony, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock in the face. Rock had made a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. ==References== Category:2022 in California Category:2020s in Los Angeles, California Category:Academy Awards Category:March 2022 events",
