 "text": "Wind engineering studies effects of wind on the buildings and its possible damage or problems to their inhabitants. From the point of structural engineering, it is interested in strong winds, which may cause discomfort, as well as extreme winds, such as in a tornado, hurricane or heavy storm, which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering needs information from meteorology, fluid dynamics, mechanics, and a number of special engineering disciplines including aerodynamics, and structural dynamics. The tools may also include atmospheric models, atmospheric boundary layer, wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics models. ==Related pages== * Earthquake engineering * Vibration control ==Notes== ==Other websites== * International Association for Wind Engineering * American Association of Wind Engineering * UK Wind Engineering Society * Wind Energy Technology Centre Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Winds",
