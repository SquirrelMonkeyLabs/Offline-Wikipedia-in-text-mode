 "text": "Mount Chimborazo is a mountain and an extinct volcano in Ecuador. Its last eruption is thought to have been over a thousand years ago. The top of Mount Chimborazo is the farthest away from the centre of the Earth as is possible to get on land. Although Mount Everest is higher, Chimborazo is farther from Earth's center because the earth bulges at the equator. == References == Category:Volcanoes of Ecuador Category:Mountains of Ecuador Category:Chimborazo Province",
