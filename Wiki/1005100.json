In 2008, the Royal Norwegian Navy had about 3,700 people and 70 ships and boats, including 4 heavy frigates, 6 submarines, 14 patrol boats, 4 minesweepers, 4 minehunters, 1 mine detection vessel, 4 support vessels and 2 training vessels. It also includes the Coast Guard. There has been a navy since 955. From 1509 to 1814 the navy was for both Denmark and Norway. The seperate Norwegian navy was started again in 1814. Norway was neutral during World War I, but the armed forces had to protect Norway's neutrality. The neutrality was sorely tested â€“ the commercial fleet suffered heavy casualties to German U-boats and commerce raiders. The Battle of Narvik, one of the first sea battles of World War II began on April 8, 1940. On June 7, 1940, thirteen ships, five aircraft and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy followed the King of Norway to the United Kingdom and continued the fight from bases there until the war ended. They took part in the Normandy Invasion in 1944. Category:Organizations based in Norway Category:Navies",
