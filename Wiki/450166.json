 "text": "Lycopsis is an extinct genus of South American metatherian. It lived during the Miocene of what is now Colombia.Argot C. 2004. Functional-adaptive analysis of the postcranial skeleton of a Laventan borhyaenoid, Lycopsis longirostris (Marsupialia, Mammalia). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 24 (3): 689. Lycopsis was more likely an ambush hunter than a pounce-pursuit predator, stalking small-to medium-sized prey. The borhyaenids in general were once arboreal, and later changed their life-style to one of living on the ground. The skeleton of Lycopsis has a mosaic of features which show it was not yet a fast runner on the ground. ==References== Category:Metatheria Category:Mammals of South America",
