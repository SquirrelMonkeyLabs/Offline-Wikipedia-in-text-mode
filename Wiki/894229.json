 "text": "Bocourt's tree frog (Dryophytes bocourti) is a frog that lives in Guatemala. Scientists have seen it between 1300 and 1536 meters above sea level in Baja Verapaz and Alta Verapaz. This frog lives in marshes and cloud forests. Scientists have found this frog in meadows full of water with no trees in them. The adult male frog is 2.6 to 3.5 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 2.9 to 3.8 cm long. Female frogs have smooth skin on their backs, and male frogs are not smooth. This frog has disks for climbing on every toe on all four feet. This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees, because humans let cows and other animals eat grass where the frog lives, because human beings build farms where the frog lives, and because of disease. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
