It has a long and narrow skull, and red and white fur. The Ethopian wolf only eats Afroalpine rodents. It only lives in mountain ranges and high altitudes. It is one of the world's rarest canids. It is Africa's most endangered carnivore. The Ethiopian wolf is threatened by increasing human populations, habitat loss through overgrazing, disease and interbreeding from dogs. ==References== Category:Canids Category:Mammals of Africa",
