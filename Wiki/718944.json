 "text": "Adolf Hitler died on 30 April 1945 in Berlin (the capital city of Germany) when the Soviets were surrounding Berlin during the final days of the European theatre of World War II. It was clear now that Germany would lose the war and so he (and his wife) committed suicide with his wife swallowing cyanide and Hitler shooting himself in the mouth. Their bodies were taken to the Reich Chancellery and burned. Two days later, Berlin surrendered. Category:Adolf Hitler Hitler, Adolf",
