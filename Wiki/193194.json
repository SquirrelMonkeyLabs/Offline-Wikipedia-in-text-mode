 "text": "An ambush, or a surprise attack,Harrap's essential English Dictionary, eds. Elaine Higgleton; Anne Seaton (New Delhi: Allied Chambers (India), Ltd., 1996), p. 32 is a long-established military tactic. It is a surprise attack from a hidden position against an enemy. The enemy may be moving or have stopped. An ambush uses the element of surprise to confuse the enemy soldiers long enough to be successful. Unlike other surprise attacks, the point of an ambush is not to gain territory. Instead, it may be used to harass an enemy. It may also be used to capture or destroy key assets (people, equipment, supplies, etc.). == In history == One of the earliest recorded use of the ambush was in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The Germanic leader Arminius ambushed three Roman legions tha√Ø were under the command of Varus. The 20,000 Roman soldiers were strung out in a long line of march through the densely-wooded forest. The Romans fought for days but in the end were completely destroyed. The Germanics had not only a military victory but also a psychological victory over the Romans. ==Related pages== * Ambush marketing * Ambush predator == References== Category:Military tactics Category:Military terminology",
