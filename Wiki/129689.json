 "text": "Dixie Dean (born William Ralph Dean, 22 January 1907 – 1 March 1980) was an English football player. He played for Everton F.C. during the 1920s and 30s. He scored more goals than any other player in English football history. Dean was born in Birkenhead in Merseyside. He began his career at his hometown club Tranmere Rovers before moving on to Everton. He was particularly known for scoring goals with his head. Dean played most of his career at Everton. When injuries caught up with him, he moved on to Notts County. Dean is best known for scoring 60 goals in the 1927–28 First Division season. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England. A statue of Dean was unveiled outside Goodison Park in 2001. A year later, he became one of the first 22 players inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number 9 shirt, and is regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time.Keith, John (2003). Dixie Dean: the inside story of a football icon.
