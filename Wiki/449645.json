 "text": "The Division of Herbert is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. It was one of the 75 divisions set up for the first federal election in 1901. It is in northern Queensland, and is named after Sir Robert Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland (1859–1866). In 1901 the division covered an area from Mackay to the Torres Strait, but today it only covers an area around the city of Townsville, as well as some nearby islands, including Magnetic Island, Orpheus Island and Palm Island. ==Members== Member Party Term Fred Bamford Labor 1901–1916 National Labor 1917–1917 Nationalist 1916–1925 Lewis Nott Nationalist 1925–1928 George Martens Labor 1928–1946 Bill Edmonds Labor 1946–1958 John Murray Liberal 1958–1961 Ted Harding Labor 1961–1966 Robert Bonnett Liberal 1966–1977 Gordon Dean Liberal 1977–1983 Ted Lindsay Labor 1983–1996 Peter Lindsay Liberal 1996–2010 Ewen Jones Liberal National 2010–present ==Election results== == References == ==Other websites== * Division of Herbert (Qld) -- Australian Electoral Commission * Ewen Jones' website Category:Electoral divisions of Queensland Category:1901 establishments in Australia",
