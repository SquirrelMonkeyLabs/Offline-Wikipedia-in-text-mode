 "text": "Virgin Islands – Puerto Rico Friendship Day is a holiday in the United States Virgin Islands. It happens on the second Monday in October. The holiday began in 1964. Governor Ralph Moses Paiewonsky wanted to show respect to Puerto Ricans who live in the Virgin Islands. The day happens at the same time as Columbus Day to respect cultures for Americans in the Caribbean. Puerto Rico is about from the United States Virgin Islands and many Puerto Ricans live in the Virgin Islands. In 2010, about 10% of the population of the United States Virgin Islands was Puerto Rican. ==Celebrations== Celebrations happen in early October, such as jazz concerts, dancing, a horse show, and events to show Puerto Rican and United States Virgin Island cultures. There are also sports events like a 5K race, as well as a parade. ==References== Category:Holidays Category:Puerto Rico Category:United States Virgin Islands Category:October observances",
