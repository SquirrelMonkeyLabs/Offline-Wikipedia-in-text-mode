 "text": "\"Ons Heemecht\" (formerly spelt \"Ons Hémecht\"; ; \"Our Homeland\") is the national anthem of Luxembourg. ==Lyrics== Only the first and last verses make up the national anthem. ===Luxembourgish original=== Luxembourgish original IPA transcription ===Translations=== English translation English translation (verse) French translation German translation I Where the Alzette through the meadows flows, Through cliffs the Sauer breaks, Where the shores of the Moselle fragrantly bloom, Heaven gifts us wine: This is the land for which we would, on this earth give anything: 𝄆 Our homeland which we carry, So deep within our hearts. 𝄇 II In her dark wreath of woods, Guarded still by the peace, Without splendour or costly shine, She cozily and lovingly smiles! Her people may with gladness say to themselves, And they aren't empty dreams: 𝄆 How homely 'tis to live therein, How good 'tis to be home. 𝄇 III Song, song, from mount and dale, The earth who bore our births, Love has rung a loyal echo, In each and every Breast! For her, no song too august be, Every word that from her rings, 𝄆 Our soul moves like heavenly sounds, And the eye like fire shines. 𝄇 IV O Thou above, who with thine own hand, Guides nations o'er the world, Guard this, our Luxembourgish land, From foreign yoke and woe! As children, thou us bestowed, A spirit, free, unbowed, 𝄆 Let shine for evermore freedom's sun, Which we so long have seen! 𝄇 I Where the Alzette slowly flows, The Sauer plays wild pranks, Where fragrant vineyards amply grow On the Mosella's banks; There lies the land for which we would Dare everything down here, 𝄆 Our own, our native land which ranks Deeply in our hearts. 𝄇 IV O Thou above whose powerful hand Makes States or lays them low, Protect this Luxembourger land From foreign yoke and woe. Your spirit of liberty bestow On us now as of yore. 𝄆 Let Freedom's sun in glory glow For now and evermore. 𝄇 ==References== ===Notes=== Category:European anthems Category:National symbols of Luxembourg",
