 "text": "Allobates pacaas is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== This frog has bright orange color on its back. ==Home== This frog lives in grasslands: cerrados and savannas in Serra dos Pacaás Novos in the state of Rondônia. It lives on table lands high above the rest of the land. Scientists saw it next to exactly one stream that flowed through a gallery forest and grasslands with shrubs. The frogs do not swim in the streams, but the streams put water into nearby air, and the frog needs this. People have seen the frog between 200 and 1230 meters above sea level. The frog lives in a protected place Parque Nacional de Pacaás Novos. This park is inside the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous Area. ==Young== Scientists did not visit the frog's home during the rainy season, so they did not see the frogs looking for mates or laying eggs or hear the male frogs calling to female frogs. They think the frog has young the same way other frogs in Allobates do: The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground and the tadpoles swim in water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. People cut down forests to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. People also come to the forest to cut trees for building wood and dig in the ground for good metals, but this is against the law. This frog is in more danger because it already lives in the highest parts of the hills and table lands in its home. If the weather gets hotter, it cannot climb higher because there is nowhere to go. It cannot move to a colder place because it would have to climb down to a warmer one first. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
