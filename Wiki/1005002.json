It was started by the NBN Trust. About 60,000 people routinely record biodiversity information in the UK and Ireland. Most of them are not paid. There are about 2,000 national societies and recording schemes. The British government also collects biodiversity data. There is a network of Local Environmental Records Centres. In 2012, it was listed in the top 1,000 UK charities that raised most donations. == References == Category:Conservation organisations of the United Kingdom Category:Charities of the United Kingdom",
