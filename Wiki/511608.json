 "text": "Wikitravel is a project to create a travel guide using open content from editors worldwide. It is based on wiki technology. Wikitravel was created in July 2003 by Evan Prodromou and Michele Ann Jenkins. It is inspired in part by Wikipedia. The project uses MediaWiki, like the Wikipedia, but it is not a project of the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikitravel formerly used a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 1.0, but since January 1, 2010 uses a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0. Among other things, this facilitates the reprinting of pages. ==Related pages== *Wikivoyage ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:MediaWiki websites Category:Websites established in 2003 Category:Wikis",
