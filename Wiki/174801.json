Their names were John Byers, played by Bruce Harwood, Ringo Langly, played by Dean Haglund, and Melvin Frohike, played by Tom Braidwood (who used to work behind the scenes on The X-Files until he was talked into taking the part of Frohike). The series expanded the line-up to include a character named Jimmy Bond, played by Stephen Snedden, and Yves Adele Harlow, played by Zuleikha Robinson. It is best known for predicting the events of 9/11 in its first episode.
