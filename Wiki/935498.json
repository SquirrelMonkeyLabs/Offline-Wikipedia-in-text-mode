 "text": "The jaguar snouted tree frog (Scinax onca) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Scinax iquitorum, but it is not. The adult male frog is 31.3 to 34.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 35.5 to 40.4 mm long. The skin on this frog's back is brown with darker brown spots. The frog's middle is white with black spots. The insides of the back legs are black in color. The belly is yellow with dark brown spots. The iris of the eye is orange in color. The tadpoles look like ovals from the top and like triangles from the side. They are gray-brown in color with one dark brown stripe from each eye to the nose. There are brown spots on the fins. The scientists found the tadpoles in a pond with no streams going into it or out of it. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
