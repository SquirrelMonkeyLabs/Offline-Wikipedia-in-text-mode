 "text": "Grand Slang is a calligraphic sans serif typeface made by a German graphic designer named Nikolas Wrobel. It was published in September 1, 2019 from his type foundry, Nikolas Type. The idea for the design of Grand Slang (IPA /ɡɹˈænd slˈæŋ/) came from 20th century American calligraphy and the work of American calligraphers Oscar Ogg and William Addison Dwiggins. It also took inspiration from signs in American movies from the 1940s and 1950s. Grand Slang is both strong and adaptable, blending various styles such as traditional and contemporary handwriting, alongside basic shapes. It includes over 310 glyphs, covering capital and small letters, numbers, punctuation marks, accents, ligatures, diacritics and symbols. The title Grand Slang comes from the English words grand and slang. The word grand is used in US and UK slang to mean a thousand dollars or a thousand pounds. The typeface is available online for download in OTF and WOFF file formats. It is useful for graphic design, web design, applications and e-books. Grand Slang can be used to write in many European languages that use the Latin alphabet. It is a proprietary software (or closed source software), so one can use it by accepting the terms of the software license. == Related pages == * Solare *Typography *Font *Writing == Other websites== *Official website * Fonts In Use (Grand Slang) * == References == Category:Fonts Category:Latin-script typefaces",
