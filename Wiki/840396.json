 "text": "The 1996 National Convention of the Republican Party of the United States met at the San Diego Convention Center (SDCC) in San Diego, California, from August 12 to August 15, 1996. The convention nominated former Senator Bob Dole from Kansas, for president and former Representative and secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, from suburban Buffalo, New York, for vice president. The Republican National Committee had narrowed their search for a site to three bidding cities, San Diego, New Orleans, and San Antonio. They eventually picked San Diego. Speakers included former Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush, former First Lady Nancy Reagan (who spoke for her husband Ronald Reagan) and former Vice President Dan Quayle. ==References== Category:1996 in the United States Category:1996 events Category:Republican Party (United States) Category:United States presidential nominating conventions",
