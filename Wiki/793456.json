If initial results from the marketing campaign suggests the campaign is going to be a successful one, the marketers will use the data to make it a more successful one. If the initial results suggests the campaign is failing, the marketers can adjust their strategy to minimize their costs and make the failing campaign a successful one. == Differences between Traditional Marketing and Agile Marketing == * In agile marketing, fast changes are made to the campaign based on initial results. * Agile marketing is a collective effort of a team rather than a few members. * Use of real-time data and analytics to change the marketing strategy * Agile marketing requires full time attention and devotion to the campaign == History of Agile Marketing == The concept of Agile Marketing was put forward on June 11, 2012 at a gathering of marketers known as the \"Sprint Zero\" == References == Category:Marketing",
