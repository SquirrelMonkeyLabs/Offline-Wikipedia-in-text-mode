 "text": "\"Roll with It\" is a song by the rock band Oasis. It was written by their former lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. The song was released on August 14, 1995. It was the second single from their second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. It reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The songwriting started off as a copy of early Beatles songs, mainly \"She Loves You\" and \"From Me to You\". \"Roll with It\" received a lot of attention when Food Records, the label of Britpop rivals Blur, moved the original release date of single \"Country House\" to match \"Roll with its release date\", sparking what came to be known as \"The Battle of Britpop\". The British media had already reported an intense rivalry between the two bands. This clash of releases was seen as a battle for the number one spot. In the end, Blur's \"Country House\" single sold 274,000 copies to Oasis' 216,000 copies of \"Roll with It\". The singles charted at number 1 and number 2, respectively. The song is like other Oasis songs, such as \"Supersonic\", because it tells the importance of being yourself. The melody for this song appears in The Lemonheads' song \"Purple Parallelogram\", which was co-written by Gallagher and Evan Dando. == Charts == Chart (1995) Peak position UK Singles Chart Look under \"Chart Log UK\", letter O 2 Irish Singles Chart Irish Charts Archive 2 It was the 20th biggest selling single of 1995 in the United Kingdom. ==References== Category:1995 songs Category:Oasis (band) songs",
