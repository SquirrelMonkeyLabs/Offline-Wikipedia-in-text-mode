 "text": "A total solar eclipse occurred on Monday, December 14, 2020. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, which will cover the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse happens when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality happens in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. The Moonâ€™s apparent diameter was larger because the eclipse occurred only 1.8 days after perigee, the point at which the Moon is closest to the Earth (on December 12, 2020). It was visible from Chile and Argentina. There was also a partial solar eclipse in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. ==Other websites== * solar- eclipse.de: The total solar eclipse of 12/14/2020 Category:December 2020 events Category:Solar eclipses",
