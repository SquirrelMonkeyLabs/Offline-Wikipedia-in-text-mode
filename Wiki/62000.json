The group was based on the Nation of Islam. It was created in the WWF by Faarooq. There were usually no more than four or five members of the NoD at any one time but as members left or became injured, other wrestlers would replace them. Members of the NoD included Rocky Maivia (The Rock), Crush, Savio Vega, D'Lo Brown, Ahmed Johnson, Kama Mustafa, Mark Henry and Owen Hart. The NoD separated in October 1998. The NoD fought mainly against D-Generation X, led by Triple H. == In wrestling == * Entrance themes ** \"We Are The Nation 97\" by Jim Johnston (1996–1998) ** \"Nation (Know Your Role Quote)\" by Jim Johnston (March 1998–November 1998) * Championships ** WWF Intercontinental Championship (one time) (The Rock) ** WWF European Championship (two times) (D'Lo Brown) ==References== ==Other websites== * Crush's WWE profile * The Rock's WWE profile * Faarooq's WWE profile * Mark Henry's WWE profile * Savio Vega's WWE profile * The Godfather's WWE profile Category:WWE teams and stables",
