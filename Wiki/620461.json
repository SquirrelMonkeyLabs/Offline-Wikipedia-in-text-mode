 "text": "The 'Non-Cooperation Movement was a significant phase of the Indian independence movement from British rule. It was led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. It aimed to resist British rule in India through non-violent means or \"satyagraha\". Protestors would refuse to buy British goods, adopt Nihal use of local handicrafts and picket and liquor shops. The ideas of Ahimsa and nonviolence, and Gandhi's ability to rally hundreds of thousands of common citizens towards the cause of Indian independence, were first seen on a large scale in this movement through summer 1920. Gandhi feared that the movement might lead to popular violence. The non- cooperation movement was launched on 4th September 1920. This movement became a breakthrough and in a way helped India achieve Independence. It was called off in February 1922 when a group of peasants lit fire to the police station in chauri chaura located in Uttar Pradesh and ended the non-cooperation.
