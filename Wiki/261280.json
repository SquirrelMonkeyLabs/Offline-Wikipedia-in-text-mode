 "text": "The following is a list of Formula One constructors. These are constructors which have competed or plan to compete in the FIA World Championship. == Terminology: constructors vs. teams == In Formula One racing the terms \"constructor\" and \"entrant\" do not mean the same thing. A constructor builds a car or engine. An entrant is the person or corporate entity that enters a race. They register a car and driver with the FIA. They are responsible for making the car ready to race, and keeping the car in good condition during the race weekend. Because of the role and activity of the entrant, the term team is often used when talking about an entrant. === Constructors === Under the FIA rules, \"the constructor of an engine or chassis is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis.\" (.pdf) Basically, who ever builds an engine or a chassis in the constructor. The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor is given to the car make that scores the most points during the season. The \"make\" of a car includes both the chassis and engine. If a car's chassis and engine are made by the same entity, then the constructor is the car make. For example Ferrari makes both the chassis and the engine. So the make is Ferrari. If the chassis and engine are made by different entities, the car's make is both constructor names put together. For example McLaren builds a chassis that uses a Mercedes engine. So the make is McLaren-Mercedes. The name of the chassis constructor is always placed before the engine constructor. Because both engine and chassis are included in the make name, chassis run with different engines are counted as two separate makes. For example, Lotus-Ford is a make different from Lotus-BRM. Each make would be scored separately. The World Constructors' Championship title is awarded to the constructor of the chassis of the make that scores the most points. This list only shows chassis constructors for that reason. For more information on engines, see Formula One engines. === Teams === Since the early 1980s, the FIA requires that Formula One entrants own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they enter. Basically, that means that teams must build their own chassis. Since this time, the terms entrant, constructor, and team now mean the same thing. Before this time, constructors were free to sell their chassis to other teams. Brabham and Lotus chassis were used by many other teams during the 1960s and 1970s. Several teams than compeated with the front-runners never built their own chassis. Rob Walker Racing Team was the most successful example. They earned the first victories in Formula One for both Cooper and Lotus. In those days, the concept of a \"works\" or \"factory\" team was the official team of the company producing the cars. Customer teams were entrants that purchased their cars off the shelf. In modern Formula One, the team must build their own car. The term customer only applies to engines now. There have been some cases since the 1980s where one company built cars for another team. Lola designed and built cars for Larrousse and Scuderia Italia in the late 1980s and early 1990s. == 2011 Constructors Statistics == Key: Constructor Country Seasons Races Drv. Entr. Wins Pts.
