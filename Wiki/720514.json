 "text": "CITES (short for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also called the Washington Convention) is an agreement between many countries to protect endangered plants and animals from the dangers of international trade. It was created after a decision made in 1963 at a meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The main goal of CITES is to make sure that trading animals and plants between countries does not put their survival in danger. CITES bans people from buying and selling certain animals that are listed in the rules, and requires a permit for buying and selling certain other kinds of animals. Countries started signing it on 3 March 1973. CITES started to have effect for the countries that originally agreed to it on 1 July 1975. Because it is an agreement between countries, it did not take effect in a country until that country agreed to it. Different countries agreed to it at different times. CITES helps protect over 38,000 species of animals and plants, giving them different levels of protection. As of April 2022, the Secretary-General of CITES is Ivonne Higuero. ==Related pages== *Wildlife Category:1970s treaties Category:Endangered species",
