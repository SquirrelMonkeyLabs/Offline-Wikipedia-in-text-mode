 "text": "The National Union Party was the name used by the Republican Party and others for the national ticket in the 1864 presidential election that was held during the Civil War. For the most part, state Republican parties did not change their name. The name was used to attract War Democrats and border states, Unconditional Unionists and Unionist Party members who would not vote for the Republican Party. The party nominated incumbent Republican President Abraham Lincoln and for Vice President Democrat Andrew Johnson, who were elected in an electoral landslide. ==References== == Further reading== *Donald, David (1995).
