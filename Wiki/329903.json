A dead woman was found in the sea tied to a mast. == Story == A proud sea captain takes his little daughter aboard his ship to keep him company. A seaman warns him a storm is approaching. He does not pay attention to this seaman. The storm hits. The captain ties his daughter to the mast. He does not want her to be swept overboard. She calls out to her dying father. She hears the waves beating on the shore. She prays to Christ to calm the seas. The ship crashes onto a reef and sinks. The next morning a fisherman finds the daughter's dead body in the sea. It is still tied to the mast. == Other websites == *Famus Igbo People *Roger McGough official website *\"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" (Project Gutenberg Text) Category:Poems by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Category:19th- century American poems Category:1840s poems",
