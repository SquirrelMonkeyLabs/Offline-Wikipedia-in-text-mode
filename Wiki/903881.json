 "text": "The cingulate cortex is a part of the brain in the middle of the cerebral cortex. The two parts of the cingulate cortex are the cingulate gyrus and the cingulate sulcus. The cingulate cortex is above the corpus callosum. ==Connections== The cingulate cortex is connected to many other parts of the brain. It gets input from the thalamus and the neocortex. Neurons send information from the cingulate cortex to the entorhinal cortex. ==Importance== The cingulate cortex is a part of the limbic system. It is important for emotions, learning, and memory. The cingulate gyrus is very important for learning from the result of actions (e.g. a child did an action that caused a bad outcome, so the child learned to not do that action). The cingulate cortex is also important in depression and schizophrenia. ==References== Category:Anatomy of the brain",
