 "text": "Regina is the capital and second-largest city of Saskatchewan, Canada. The city is in the eastern prairie region of Western Canada. It is nicknamed \"The Queen City\" because it was named after Queen Victoria (Victoria Regina in Latin) in 1882, by her daughter Princess Louise, who was the wife of the Candian Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne. Regina was also the seat of government for the Northwest Territories, which used to include what are now Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as the District of Assiniboia. Regina is expected to enter a new period of strong economic growth because Saskatchewan's agricultural and mineral resources have come into more demand. The Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League are the only professional sports team in Regina. They play their home games in Regina at Mosaic Stadium. The city also has the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League and the University of Regina's Regina Cougars/Regina Rams of the Canadian Interuniversity Sport. == Media == * CKCK CTV Television Network * CFRE Global Television Network * Access Communications * Saskatchewan Communications Network == References == == Other websites == * Official Regina website",
