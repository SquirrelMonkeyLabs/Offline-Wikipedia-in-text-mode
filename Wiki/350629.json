The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. He founded the company Solvay & Cie. The first factory was at Couillet in 1863. Soon, Solvay process plants were in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Austria. Today, about 70 Solvay process plants are still working worldwide. In 1903, he founded the Solvay Business School which is part of the Free University of Brussels. He elected two times to the Belgian Senate. He was Minister of State at the end of his life. Solvay, New York and Rosignano Solvay, the locations of the first Solvay process plants in the United States and in Italy, are named after him. Solvay died at Ixelles.
