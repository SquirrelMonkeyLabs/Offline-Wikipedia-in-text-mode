 "text": "The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas is a book by Gertrude Stein, written in October and November 1932 and published in 1933. Written by Stein, the book pretends to be an autobiography written by Alice B. Toklas, Stein's life partner. It tells the story of Toklas and Stein from Toklas' birth, through their meeting and life together in Paris, to their life and Stein's work after World War I. Toklas is very present in the book, but it is mainly about Gertrude Stein and her life in Paris at the time. Modern Library ranked it in 1998 as one of the 20 greatest English-language nonfiction books of the 20th century. ==References== Category:American autobiographies Category:1932 books",
