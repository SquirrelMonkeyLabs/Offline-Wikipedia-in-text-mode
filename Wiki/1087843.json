 "text": "Yahya Sinwar (Arabic: يحيى السنوار) (29 October 1962 - 16 October 2024) was a Palestinian politician who was the leader of Hamas in Gaza. ==Early life== He was born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Egyptian-governed Gaza in 1962. His family were forcibly expelled from the city of Al-Majdal Asqalan by Jewish terrorists during the 1948 War. He completed his academia at the Muslim University of Gaza and received a bachelor's degree in Arabic studies. == Activities == For planning the capture and liquidation of two Israeli terrorists and four Palestinians accused of collaboration in 1989, he was sentenced to four life sentences by the Israeli regime, of which he served 22 years until his release among 1,026 others in a 2011 prisoner exchange. In 2017, he was elected as the leader of Hamas, and stated to pursue \"peaceful, popular resistance\" to the violent Israeli occupation the next year. He was re-elected as the leader of Hamas in 2021, and had a failed assassination against him by Israel that year. == Personal Life == In addition to his native Arabic, Sinwar spoke Hebrew, which he learned, along with insights into Jewish culture, while held captive by Israel. ==Death== On 17 October 2024, Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet said they were looking into whether Sinwar was among three individuals killed in an operation in Gaza that had taken place the day before, though neither Israel or Hamas made any official confirmation. A body believed to be Sinwar's and a DNA sample were collected. According to Kan radio, the bodies of Sinwar and his associates were found with cash, weapons and fake IDs. The IDF confirmed through DNA analysis that Sinwar had been killed a day earlier in Gaza during a firefight with the IDF. == References == Category:1962 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Palestinian politicians Category:Palestinian militants Category:Hamas Category:Assassinated people Category:Deaths by firearm",
