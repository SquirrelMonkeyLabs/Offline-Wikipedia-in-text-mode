 "text": "On 22 June 2019, factions of the security forces of Ethiopia's Amhara Region attempted a coup d'état against the regional government, during which the President of the Amhara Region, Ambachew Mekonnen, was assassinated. A bodyguard siding with the nationalist factions assassinated General Se'are Mekonnen – the Chief of the General Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force – as well as his aide, Major General Gizae Aberra. The Prime Minister's Office accused Brigadier General Asaminew Tsige, head of the Amhara region security forces, of leading the plot. Asaminew remained at large for 36 hours after the attempt. The state media confirmed that he was shot dead by police near Bahir Dar on 24 June, while several of his alleged co-conspirators have been detained. Following the coup attempt, internet access was shut down nationwide. ==References== Category:2019 in Africa Category:2010s crimes in Africa Category:Coups d'état Category:21st century in Ethiopia Category:June 2019 events Category:Murder in Africa Category:Murder in the 2010s",
