[Part 3] \\- All TracksDigital Library The band has sold 26 million albums in the United States alone. CCR was inducted into (became part of) the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Many people thought they were from the Southeastern United States because the group's music sounded like the country, folk, and blues music of that place. They liked to sing about bayous, the Mississippi River, catfish, and other things people in the south liked. They also used instruments and styles that were common in the southeast. For many people, CCR was the soundtrack of their youth. The documentary \"Travelin' Band: Creedence Clearwater Revival at the Royal Albert Hall\" shows CCR was famous worldwide.. In 1969, they made three albums that made the top fifteen. Cosmos Factory (1970) sold as many or more albums as the Beatles‘ Let It Be and Led Zeppelin‘s III. Their guitar playing and John Fogerty's voice made any CCR song instantly recognizable. The members of the group were John Fogerty (born 1945), his brother Tom Fogerty (1941-1990), Doug Clifford (born 1945), and Stu Cook (born 1945). ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968) * Bayou Country (1969) * Green River (1969) * Willy and the Poor Boys (1969) * Cosmo's Factory (1970) * Pendulum (1970) * Mardi Gras (1972) ==References== ==Other websites== * Creedence-Online * Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Ed Sullivan Show * Creedence Clearwater Revival at WorldMusicDatabase * * Category:1967 establishments in California Category:1972 disestablishments in the United States Category:American rock bands Category:Musical groups from California Category:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Category:Southern rock bands Category:1970s disestablishments in California",
