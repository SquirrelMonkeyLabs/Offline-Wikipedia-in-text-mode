It claimed the land of the Eastern Region of Nigeria. The country was mainly populated by the Igbo people. Biafra was officially recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Zambia.\"Was \"Biafra\" at Any Time A State in International Law?\"Biafra was also de facto recognised by France, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Israel, Rhodesia, South Africa and the Vatican City. Biafra also had aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, foreign mercenaries and the Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland. The United States government under president Lyndon B. Johnson was officially neutral during the war. There was strong public support for Biafra in the US.\"Fifty Years Later: U.S. Intelligence Shortcomings in the Nigerian Civil War\" American activists founded the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive to spread propaganda.\"'And starvation is the grim reaper': the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive and the genocide question during the Nigerian civil war, 1968â€“70\" United States president Richard Nixon was supportive of the Biafran cause. Before he won the 1968 presidential election he accused Nigeria of committing genocide against the Biafrans. He also called for the United States to intervene in the war on the side of Biafra. His efforts failed because of the demands of the ongoing Vietnam War. After two-and-a-half years of war with Nigeria, during which almost two million Biafran civilians (three-quarters of them being smaller children) died from starvation caused by the Nigerian blockade of the region. == Economy == An early body created by the Biafran government was the Bank of Biafra, made under \"Decree No. 3 of 1967\". The bank carried out all central banking functions including the management of foreign exchange and the management of Biafra's public debt. The bank was managed by a governor and four directors. The first governor was Sylvester Ugoh.\"Nigeria: The men who may be President (1)\" A second degree, \"Decree No. 4 of 1967\", changed the Banking Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the Republic of Biafra. The bank was originally in Enugu but because of the Nigerian Civil War it had to be moved multiple times. Biafra tried to finance the war through foreign exchange. This effort increased when Nigeria said that its currency wouldn't be legal tender (to make way for a new currency). == References == Category:Former countries in Africa Category:Nigeria",
