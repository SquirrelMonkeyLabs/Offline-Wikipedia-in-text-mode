 "text": "The River Tame flows through Greater Manchester. It starts on Denshaw Moor in Saddleworth at the reservoir and flows to Stockport where it joins the River Goyt to form the River Mersey. It goes south through Delph, Uppermill, Mossley, Stalybridge, Ashton-under-Lyne, Dukinfield, Haughton Green, Denton and Hyde, and gives its name to the borough of Tameside. It was very polluted. Up to two-thirds of the river's flow when it met the Goyt had passed through a sewage works. Since 1970 there have been efforts to clean it, but In 2018 a study found that the river contained the greatest amount of microplastic contamination of any river yet surveyed. == References == Category:Rivers of Greater Manchester Category:Tameside",
