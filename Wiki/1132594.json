 "text": "Crystal healing is a religious practice that uses semiprecious stones and crystals such as quartz, agate, amethyst or opal. People who do this say that these minerals have healing powers, and there is no science that supports this.Regal, Brian. (2009). Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia. Greenwood. p. 51. Those people say that the minerals can boost low energy, stop bad energy, release blocked energy, and change a body's aura. In one method, the practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body, often corresponding to chakras; or else the person puts the crystals in an order to try to make an energy grid, which is thought to surround the person getting the treatment with healing energy. Scientists have found no proof that such \"energy grids\" are real, and there is no evidence that crystal healing has any better effect for a person than any other placebo (treatment that on purpose is intended to have no effect the body). Where the practice is popular, it makes people want crystals more, which can result in damage to the Earth and child labor to mine the crystals. == References == Category:Pseudoscience",
