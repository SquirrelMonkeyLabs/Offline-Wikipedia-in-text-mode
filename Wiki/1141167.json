 "text": "The Choco rocket frog (Hyloxalus chocoensis) is a frog. It lives in Panama and Colombia. ==Home== People have seen this frog in places where there is water in the air, but scientists are not sure if this is the only kind of place it can live. People have seen this frog between 70 and 805 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Hyloxalus do: The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out because people change the place where it lives to make farms and get wood to build with. Scientists also think fish from other parts of the world could kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
