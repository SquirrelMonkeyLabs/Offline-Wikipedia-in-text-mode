 "text": "The First Battle of the Atlantic (1914â€“1918) was a naval campaign of World War I, largely fought in the seas around the British Isles and in the Atlantic Ocean. Both the German Empire and United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed their population and supply their war industry; thus both aimed to blockade each other. The British had the Royal Navy which was superior in numbers and could operate within the British Empire. The German Navy could not destroy the British Navy, as seen at the Battle of Jutland. The German fleet mainly used unrestricted submarine warfare. Neutral countries disliked the blockades and the sinking of RMS Lusitania especially angered the United States. The successful blockade of Germany contributed to its military defeat in 1918, and still in effect, enforced also the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in mid-1919. == The Battle in Numbers == === Allied and Neutral Tonnage sunk by submarines in World War I === Month 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 January 47,981 81,259 368,521 306,658 February 59,921 117,547 540,006 318,957 March 80,775 167,097 593,841 342,597 April 55,725 191,667 881,027 278,719 May 120,058 129,175 596,629 295,520 June 131,428 108,855 687,507 255,587 July 109,640 118,215 557,988 260,967 August 62,767 185,866 162,744 511,730 283,815 September 98,378 151,884 230,460 351,748 187,881 October 87,917 88,534 353,660 458,558 118,559 November 19,413 153,043 311,508 289,212 17,682 December 44,197 123,141 355,139 399,212 Total 312,672 1,307,996 2,327,326 6,235,878 2,666,942 Grand Total 12,850,814 gross tons Note that unrestricted submarine warfare was resumed in February 1917 and the British began full-scale convoying in September 1917.
