This is a suborder of the Diprotodonts, a large order which includes the kangaroos and its relatives. Possums are native to Australia and are protected there. Possums spend the first four months of their lives in their mother's pouch. By the time they are six months old, the young possums live outside the pouch. They are nocturnal and at least partly arboreal. Some of the smaller species are gliders. They have sharp claws and a keen sense of smell. They eat the leaves of trees, insects, berries and bird's eggs. The first possums were brought to New Zealand in 1837 from Australia.
