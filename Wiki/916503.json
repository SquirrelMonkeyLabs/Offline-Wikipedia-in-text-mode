 "text": "The Aromanians () are an ethnic group who speak an Eastern Romance language and are native to the southern Balkans. There are several theories about them. The strongest theory says that they are descendants of Latin-speaking Greeks from areas of Ancient Greece like Macedonia... The Aromanians are called Vlachs but call themselves Aromani or Arumani. In one of their songs called the Song of Metsovo, Aromanians sing: \"Νόι ντι του μούντσι χίμου Ελάσλι\" (transliteration: \"Nói nti tou moúntsi chímou Elásli\", \"We highlanders are the Hellenes\"). ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * *",
