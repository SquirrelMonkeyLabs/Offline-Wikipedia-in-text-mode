 "text": "Poe Dameron is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. He was introduced in the 2015 movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He was played by Oscar Isaac. Poe is an X-wing pilot for the Resistance who brings renegade stormtrooper Finn and Jakku scavenger Rey into the fight against—and eventually a victory over—the sinister First Order. He is the master of the loving android BB-8. He is featured in The Force Awakens media and merchandising, and will appear in the movie's forthcoming sequel, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Isaac and the character have received positive reviews, with Poe being compared to the characterization of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in the original Star Wars movie trilogy. ==References== ==Other websites== * Poe Dameron in the Official StarWars.com Encyclopedia Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2015 Category:Star Wars characters",
