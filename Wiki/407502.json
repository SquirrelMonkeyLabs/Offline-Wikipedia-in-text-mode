 "text": "Mohamed Morsi (, ALA-LC: Muḥammad Muḥammad Mursī ‘Īsá al-‘Ayyāṭ ; 8 August 1951 – 17 June 2019) was an Egyptian politician. With the support of the Muslim Brotherhood he became the fifth President of Egypt on 30 June 2012. On 3 July 2012, the Egyptian defense minister Abdul Fatah Khalil Al-Sisi declared that Morsi would no longer be president, after many people who wanted him to resign began protesting. On 16 May 2015, Morsi was sentenced to death by an Egyptian court for passing state secrets to Qatar. In 2016 a higher court overturned the death penalty, pending another trial. On 17 June 2019, Morsi reportedly had a heart attack in a Cairo court and later died, aged 67. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Egyptian Muslims Category:Presidents of Egypt Category:Cairo University alumni",
