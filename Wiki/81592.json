Brooks was successful in the country singles and country album charts and later also proved popular in the mainstream pop arena, exposing country music to a larger audience. Brooks has had one of the most successful careers in popular music history, with over 70 hit singles and 15 charted albums to his credit.

He started performing at bars while studying advertising in college and also working as a bouncer. In 2001, Brooks officially retired from recording and performing, after having conflicts between his career and family. During this time he has sold millions of albums through an exclusive distribution deal with Walmart and has released new singles from time to time. On November 6, 2007, The Ultimate Hits was released. Brooks came out of retirement in 2007 when he opened a new arena in Kansas City, Missouri.
