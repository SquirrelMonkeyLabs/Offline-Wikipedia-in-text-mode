The Viceroy of India was created, along with an Executive Council, in India, which consisted of high officials of the British government. The Indian Councils Act 1861 provided for a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council and non-official members; and the Indian Councils Act 1892 established legislatures in each of the provinces of British India. These Acts may have increased the Indian representation in government, but the councils' power remained limited, and the electorate also remained very small. The participation of Indians in the administration increased after the passage of the Indian Councils Act 1909 and the Government of India Act 1919. The Indian Independence Act was passed on July 18, 1947, and as a result British India was to be divided into India and Pakistan upon independence on August 15, 1947. They were to be dominions (India, Pakistan) under the Crown until they had enacted their own constitutions. The Constituent Assembly was divided into two for the separate nations, with each new Assembly having sovereign powers transferred to it for the respective dominion. India became a republic on January 26, 1950. == Structure == State Number of Seats Andhra Pradesh 25 Arunachal Pradesh 2 Assam 14 Bengal, West 42 Bihar 40 Chhattisgarh 11 Goa 2 Gujarat 26 Haryana 10 Himachal Pradesh 4 Jammu and Kashmir 6 Jharkhand 14 Karnataka 28 Kerala 20 Madhya Pradesh 29 Maharashtra 48 Manipur 2 Meghalaya 2 Mizoram 1 Nagaland 1 Odisha 21 Punjab 13 Rajasthan 25 Sikkim 1 Tamil Nadu 39 Telangana 17 Tripura 2 Uttarakhand 5 Uttar Pradesh 80 Territoiries Andaman and Nicobar Islands 1 Chandigarh 1 Dadra and Nagar Haveli 1 Daman and Diu 1 Delhi 7 Lakshadweep 1 Puducherry 1 TOTAL 543 ==References== Category:Lok Sabha",
