His father, Charles VI of France, had disinherited him. He was called “King of Bourges” because Bourges was one of the few places he still controlled. Joan of Arc took back land for him, but she was burned at the stake after he refused to pay her ransom. The Hundred Years' War ended while Charles VII was king.
