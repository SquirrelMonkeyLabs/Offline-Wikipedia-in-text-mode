Through its dark and haunting atmosphere, \"The Blind Owl\" delves into the depths of the human psyche, leaving a lasting impact on Persian literature. ==Simplified Plot== The story is about a painter who doesn't have a name and feels really sad after losing a lover. He talks to a shadow on his wall that looks like an owl and shares his dark thoughts. In his weird dreams, he believes that death destroys everything imaginary. The narrator thinks we come from death and it frees us from the fake attractions of life. The novel has two parts. The first part is like a strange dream with the narrator on opium, his complicated feelings for a woman, and a strange old man. The second part tells the same story more realistically, with some details that don't match the first part.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-FkkajU7E0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dac6NOD4PUA === Key themes === * Existentialism: Hedayat's work delves into existential themes, reflecting on the meaning and purpose of life.
