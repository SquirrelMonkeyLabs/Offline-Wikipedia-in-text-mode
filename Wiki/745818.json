 "text": "Brazilianite is a typically yellow-green phosphate mineral, most commonly found in phosphate-rich pegmatites. It was originally found in Brazil, and was named after the country in which it was first found. Brazilianite Brazilianite from type locality, Conselheiro Pena, Minas Gerais, Brazil General Category Phosphate minerals Formula (repeating unit) NaAl3(PO4)2(OH)4 sodium aluminium phosphate hydroxide Strunz classification 8.BK.05 Crystal system Monoclinic Crystal class Prismatic (2/m) (same H-M symbol) Space group P21/n Unit cell a = 11.229 Å, b = 10.142 Å, c = 7.098 Å; β = 97.4°; Z = 4 Identification Color Yellow, green, colorless Crystal habit Prismatic crystals, may be radially- fibrous or globular druses Cleavage (010) Distinct to good Fracture Conchoidal Mohs scale hardness 5.5 Luster Vitreous Streak White Diaphaneity Transparent to translucent Specific gravity 2.98 Optical properties Biaxial (+) Refractive index nα = 1.602 nβ = 1.609 nγ = 1.621 - 1.623 Birefringence δ = 0.019 - 0.021 References It occurs in the form of perfect crystals grouped in druses, in pegmatites, and is often of precious-stone quality. One noted deposit of brazilianite is in the surroundings of Conselheiro Pena, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Some of these are found on leaves of muscovite with their strong silvery glitter, ingrown in their parent rock. The crystals, dark greenish- yellow to olive-green, sometimes measure up to 12 cm (4.7 in) in length and 8 cm (3.1 in) in width. Crystals of similar shape and dimensions have been discovered in another deposit in Minas Gerais, near Mantena, but they lack the perfection of the crystal form. Many brazilianites found in mineral collections originated from the Palermo and the Charles Davis mines in Grafton County, New Hampshire.
