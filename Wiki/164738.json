 "text": "Hurricane Isidore was the strongest hurricane in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Isidore affected the Windward Islands, Venezuela, Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula, parts of the United States. Some forecasters showed it possible for Isidore to make landfall in the United States as a category 4 hurricane. But since Isidore moved slow over Mexico, it struck the Louisiana as only a tropical storm. Hurricane Isidore killed 22 people and left $1.3 billion in damage. The name \"Isidore\" was retired, which means it will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replace with the \"Ike\", which was used in 2008 and was also retired.
