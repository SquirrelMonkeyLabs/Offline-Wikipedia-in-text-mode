 "text": "Jason Peter \"Jay\" Garrick, also known as the Flash, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert, first appearing in Flash Comics #1 (1940). == Fictional character biography == He is a speedster and the original super-hero known as the Flash. He was a Golden Age character who first appeared during World War II as a member of the Justice Society of America and the All-Star Squadron. His earliest adventures in Keystone City took place on Earth-Two, although he was introduced into mainstream continuity during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Garrick's career inspired his successor, Barry Allen to become the second Flash. They teamed up on many occasions, along with Kid Flash and other members of the Flash Family. As one of the oldest surviving super-heroes, he continues to fight against evil and acts as a mentor to the younger generation. Joan Williams is his wife of many years whom he currently lives with. == Powers and abilities == As the Flash, Garrick can run at superhuman speeds and has superhumanly-fast reflexes, tapping into the Speed Force. The limits of his speed have fluctuated over the years, though he has usually been second to DC's \"flagship\" Flash, Barry Allen and his successor, Wally West. == In other media == The character made its live-action debut as a cameo in the television series Smallville, played by Billy Mitchell. John Wesley Shipp later appears as a recurring character in the Arrowverse television series The Flash, and in a guest capacity in the unrelated television series Stargirl.
