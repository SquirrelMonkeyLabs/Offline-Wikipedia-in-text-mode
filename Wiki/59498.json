 "text": "The scale of a map shows the ratio between the distances on the map and the corresponding distances in reality. For example, a map of scale 1:50,000 shows a distance of 50,000 cm (or 500 m) as 1 cm on a map. A 1:25 scale model of a building with a height of 30 m has a model height of 1.20 m. When a drawing or model or photograph of an object is larger or smaller than the original, the scale represents how much the object has been \"grown\" or \"shrunk\". == Scale bars == Scale bars for microscopic or unusual objects are necessary. They help readers to understand the diagram. ==Related pages== * Proportionality * Scale (map) Category:Measurement",
