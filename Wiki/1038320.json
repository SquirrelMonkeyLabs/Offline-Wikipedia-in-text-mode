 "text": "Spain women's national football team (Spanish: Selección Española de Fútbol Femenina) has been representing Spain in women's football competitions since 1980. It's managed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, which is in charge of football in Spain. Spain's women's team has qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup twice and for the UEFA Women's Championship three times. They got to the semifinals in 1997. While they haven't achieved as much at the senior level, their youth teams have done really well, especially in 2018. They won two important titles (U-17 and U-19) and made it to the finals in the U-17 and U-20 World Cups, actually winning the U-17 World Cup. In 2020, Spain climbed up the FIFA international rankings and became one of the top 10 teams in the world. Their players also won several awards from UEFA in 2020. These awards included best goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward, and overall best player. Interestingly, this was the first time players from one country won all these categories. ==Honours== === Major competitions === FIFA Women's World Cup :TBD ===Minor Titles=== *Algarve Cup :Champions: 2017 *Cyprus Cup :Champions: 2018 *SheBelieves Cup :Runners-up: 2020 *Arnold Clark Cup :Runners-up: 2022 *Cup of Nations :Runners-up: 2023 *Albena Cup :Third place: 1995 ===Individual awards=== *UEFA Women's Championship All-Star Team: Verónica Boquete (2013), Aitana Bonmatí (2022) *Grand Hotel Varna Tournament top scorer: Mar Prieto (1992) *Algarve Cup best player: Irene Paredes (2017) *Cyprus Cup Golden Glove: Dolores Gallardo (2018) *Algarve Cup top scorer: Jennifer Hermoso (2019) *SheBelieves Cup best player: Alexia Putellas (2020) *SheBelieves Cup top scorer: Lucía García and Alexia Putellas (2020) *Arnold Clark Cup best player: Athenea del Castillo (2022) *Arnold Clark Cup top scorer: Alexia Putellas (2022) *Cup of Nations top scorer: Esther González (2023) ===Other awards=== *Premios Nacionales del Deporte (National Sports Awards): Baron de Güell Cup (2014) ==References== Category:European women's national association football teams Category:Football in Spain Category:National sports teams of Spain",
