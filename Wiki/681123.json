From 1878 to 1918, it was part of the German Empire. From 1918 until 1945, it was a part of the Weimar Republic's Free State of Prussia. It's capital was Königsberg. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the area was divided into to the Soviet Union (Russian SFSR, and Lithuanian SSR) and Poland (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship). Königsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946. The German population either evacuated or was expelled. == Related pages == * List of cities and towns in East Prussia == References == Category:1945 disestablishments in Germany Category:Regions of Europe Category:18th-century establishments in Germany Category:1772 establishments Category:1770s establishments in Europe Category:1773 establishments",
