 "text": "André Le Nôtre (12 March 1613 - 15 September 1700) was a French landscape architect and gardener serving King Louis XVI of France. He designed and constructed the formal gardens at the Palace of Versailles. Other gardens and parks in France he designed include those of Vaux-le-Vicomte, Chantilly, Fontainebleau, Saint-Cloud, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and the Tuileries. Le Notre's style of garden design was widely imitated in Europe, but without his taste and sound professional judgement. In the 18th century, his designs at Versailles influenced the master plan for Washington, D.C. ==Gallery== File:Vaux-le-Vicomte Garten.jpg|Vaux-le-Vicomte File:Chantilly-Le- Nostre.jpg|Chantilly ==References== Category:17th-century French people Category:1613 births Category:1700 deaths Category:Architects from Paris",
