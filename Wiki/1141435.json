 "text": "Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr. (July 25, 1915 â€“ August 12, 1944) was a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. He was a member of the Kennedy family and the eldest of the nine children born to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. During World War II, Kennedy was killed in action as a bomber pilot. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. Kennedy's father wanted him to become president of the United States. Kennedy was a delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention and planned to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives after his military service. Kennedy's death caused his father to want his next-oldest son, John F. Kennedy, to run for president. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Aviation deaths Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Military people from Massachusetts Category:Democrats (United States) Category:American aviators Category:Kennedy family",
