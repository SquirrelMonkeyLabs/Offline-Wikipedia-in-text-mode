 "text": "The Sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston was part of many cases of Catholic Church sexual abuse cases in the United States that revealed many crimes in the American Roman Catholic Church. In early 2002, The Boston Globe published results of an investigation that led to the criminal prosecutions of five Roman Catholic priests and pushed the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy into the national spotlight. Another accused priest who was involved in the Spotlight scandal also pleaded guilty. The Globe's coverage encouraged other victims to come forward with allegations of abuse, resulting in numerous lawsuits and more criminal cases.Bruni, A Gospel of Shame (2002), p. 336 Later investigations and allegations revealed a pattern of sexual abuse and cover-ups in a number of large dioceses across the United States. The investigation of the scandal by The Boston Globe was titled \"Spotlight Investigation: Abuse in the Catholic Church\". Its reporting was made into a movie in 2015, which won two Academy Awards including Best Picture. ==References== Category:2002 in the United States Category:21st century in Boston Category:Roman Catholicism Category:Scandals Category:Child sexual abuse",
