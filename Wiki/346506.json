 "text": "The national emblem of Belarus replaced the historic Pahonia arms in 1995. It has a ribbon in the colors of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is sometimes called the coat of arms of Belarus, but this is not correct. Despite the fact that the Belarusians share a distinct ethnic identity and language, they never previously had a political sovereignty prior to 1991, except during a brief period in 1918 when the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic used the horseman as its emblem.Belarus | History, Flag, Map, Population, Capital, Language, & Facts. Encyclopedia Britannica. The unique Belarusian national symbols were not created as a result of the foreign rule of the Belarusian territories by Prussia, Poland, Lithuania, and Russia until the 20th century.Smith, Whitney.
