 "text": "James Victor \"Jimmy\" Scott (July 17, 1925 - June 12, 2014), also known as \"Little\" Jimmy Scott, was an American jazz singer. He was known for his unusually high contralto voice. This is because he had Kallmann's syndrome, a very rare genetic condition. The condition prevented him from reaching puberty, leaving him with a high, undeveloped voice. Scott died in Las Vegas, Nevada from cardiac arrest, aged 88. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Deaths from cardiac arrest Category:American jazz singers Category:Singers from Cleveland",
