 "text": "Anomaloglossus verbeeksnyderorum is a frog. Scientists found it in Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives in streams over granite rock in forests that have never been cut. Scientists saw this frog between 56 and 300 meters above sea level. Scientists think the frog might live in some protected places, for example Sipapo Forest Reserve and Chivapure-Cuchivero Forest Area Under Protection. ==Young== The male frogs hide in the dead leaves on the ground and call to the female frogs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to ponds, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in big danger of dying out. Human beings, for example visitors, come to their home and change it. Bad chemicals can also kill this frog. Sometimes people dig for aluminum and gold in the ground. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
