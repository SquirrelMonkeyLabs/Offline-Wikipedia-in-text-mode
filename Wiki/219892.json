 "text": "A pacemaker is a device created by Earl Bakken that helps to regulate your heart, if you have arrhythmia. It uses electrical pulses. If your heart is beating too fast, the pacemaker slows it down. If your heart slows down, the pacemaker will slightly speed it up, so that it goes back to a normal heart beat.
