 "text": "The Andean poison frog or Andean poison-arrow frog (Andinobates opisthomelas) is a frog. It lives in Peru and Ecuador. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground. People have seen it on dead leaves on the ground or near the bottoms of trees in forests on mountains. It can live in big forests or small pieces of forests where people have cut down the places in between.People have seen this frog between 530 and 2200 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles on his back. He takes them to water. For example, he takes them to water in the leaves of bromeliad plants. ==Danger== This frog is in some danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives to make farms, make places to raise animals, and get wood to build with. Fires also burn down the frog's forests. Chemicals meant to kill insects that eat farm plants can also kill this frog. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet, even though this is a crime. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example La Forzosa, Bosques de Isagen, and Bosques de EPM. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
