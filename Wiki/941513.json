 "text": "\"Ziggy Stardust\" is a song by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was on Bowieâ€™s 1972 concept album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. It was made by both Bowie and Ken Scott. It was recorded at Trident Studios in London in November 1971. The song is about Ziggy Stardust, a bisexual alien rock star who is a messenger for other aliens. The character was based on English singer Vince Taylor, the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, and Kansai Yamamoto. The song is glam rock and so is the album. It was remade in 1982 by Bauhaus.
