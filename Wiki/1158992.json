 "text": "Sampaloc is a district of the city of Manila, Philippines. It is famed for numerous educational institutions found within it and its vicinity. Most notable among these educational institutions is the University of Santo Tomas (UST), officially the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, founded in 1611. ==History== The establishment of Sampaloc as a town coincided with its establishment as a parish spun off independently from Santa Ana de Sapa in 1613. At that time, it also included what is now the current district of Pandacan, Manila which was spun off in 1712. Until the early 20th century, Sampaloc consisted of rice fields and forests dotted with hills and hamlets linked by natural village pathways. The area was filled with groves of tamarind trees (Tamarindus indica) called \"Sampalok\" in the Tagalog language (hispanized as Sampaloc); after which the district is named. == References== Category:Settlements in Manila Category:Districts of Manila",
