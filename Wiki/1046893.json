 "text": "The Zambia National Service (ZNS) is a part of Zambia's defense force. It was started in 1971 by a decision from the government. ZNS has two main jobs: to train people and protect the country. It's allowed to get people ready to serve the nation. Besides defense, ZNS also helps teach farming and craft skills to Zambians, which helps the country become more self-reliant and prosperous. Originally, it was called the Land Army back in 1963 but has since become a military organization that helps Zambia in many ways. It's also known for supporting the Green Eagles football club. == References == Category:Military of Zambia Category:Zambia",
