 "text": "The Gallipoli Campaignor the Dardanelles Campaign and the Battle of Gallipoli was an attack during World War I on the Gallipoli peninsula between April 25, 1915, and January 9, 1916. The Allied forces of the British Empire and of France fought the Ottoman Empire with the purpose of allowing ships to bring supplies by the Black Sea. That would help the Russian Empire break its stalemate on the Eastern Front. The campaign started with a naval attack along the Dardanelles. Naval mines sank or damaged several ships, and the Ottomans fought back and stopped the Allies from entering the Sea of Marmara. It was decided that if the Russians were to receive any British help, a land invasion would be necessary. On April 25, 1915, Allied forces landed at various locations along the peninsula. Many of the British soldiers landed in the wrong places, which caused many casualties. The British landed at Cape Helles, and the Australians and New Zealanders (AZNAC) landed at a place that was later known as Anzac Cove. However, the Allies did not push on but they were told to dig trenches and to wait for an Ottoman attack. Trench warfare occurred until the evacuation of all Allied troops was finally ordered. The campaign is widely viewed as an Allied failure. The British historian A.J.P. Taylor wrote of the Gallipoli Campaign, \"The Gallipoli expedition was a terrible example of an ingenious strategical idea carried through after inadequate preparation and with inadequate drive.\" Mustafa Kemal led the Ottoman defenders in what was the only important victory in the war and so he became a hero. Years after the war ended, he became the first president of Turkey. He paid tribute to the ANZAC soldiers who had died in the campaign. ==References== Category:1915 in Europe Category:1916 in Europe Category:British Empire Category:Battles of World War I Category:Battles involving India Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles involving Germany Category:Battles involving Australia Category:1910s in the Ottoman Empire Category:Battles involving New Zealand Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom",
