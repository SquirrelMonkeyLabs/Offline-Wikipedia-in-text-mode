 "text": "Augustan literature refers to the books belonging to the British literature that were written during the rules of Queen Anne, King George I, and George II. This happened between the first half of the 18th century and the 1740s. During this time, there was a fast development of the novel and the satire, the change of drama from political satire into melodrama and an evolution toward poetry of personal exploration. In philosophy, it was an age ruled by empiricism, while in the writings of political economy, it marked the evolution of mercantilism as a formal philosophy, the development of capitalism and the victory of trade.
