 "text": "Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) is a slogan and American political movement led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., focusing on his role as the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the second Trump administration. Kennedy Jr. created the slogan when he ran an independent campaign for U.S. President in 2024. The MAHA movement focuses on curing chronic illnesses, supporting healthier lifestyle choices, and stopping the corruption in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The phrase \"make America healthy again\" is comes from Trump's political slogan, Make America Great Again. The movement has been criticized by some health officials because of Kennedy's history of spreading conspiracy theories and false information about public health and vaccines. During his confirmation hearing in January 2025, Kennedy said he was never anti-vaccine and promised not to remove any vaccines from the market. ==References== Category:Political slogans Category:2024 United States presidential election",
