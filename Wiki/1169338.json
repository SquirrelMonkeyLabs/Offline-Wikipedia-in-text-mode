The line of succession is specified by the Constitution of Argentina, Article 88, as well as the Law of Presidential Acephaly No. 25,716 (itself an amendment of Law No. 20,972). Presidential line of succession 1\\. Vice president 2\\. Provisional president of the Senate 3\\. President of the Chamber of Deputies 4\\. President of the Supreme Court == Constitutional dispositions and legislation == * Article 88 of the Argentine constitution places the vice president at the start of the line of succession and allows Congress to choose a provisional successor in the scenario that neither the president nor vice president can take office. * Article 153 of the National Electoral Code, for the case where elections have already been carried out, determines that in case of death or resignation of either the president-elect or vice president-elect, article 88 of the Constitution shall be applied, that is if the president-elect is unable to take office due to death or resignation, he shall be replaced by the vice president-elect. Article 154 goes on to determine that, in case of death of both, new elections shall be carried out. * Law 25,716 of Presidential Acephaly, which was sanctioned on 28 November 2002 and came into effect on 7 January 2003, indicates in its first article that, if the absence of the presidency and vice presidency is definitive, the provisional president of the Senate will exercise the executive power until Congress decides the definitive succession in the Legislative Assembly. If the provisional president of the Senate cannot take office, the duty shall fall on the president of the Chamber of Deputies, and if he too is unable, the president of the Supreme Court of Justice shall take office. According to article 6, this official shall add to his office, \"In exercise of Executive Power\". == References == Category:Politics of Argentina",
