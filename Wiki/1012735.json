 "text": "Withings is a French consumer electronics company. == History == It was founded in 2008 by Éric Carreel, Cédric Hutchings, and Fred Potter. Withings gained recognition for introducing the first Wi-Fi scale in 2009. It measures weight and fat mass and sends data to the user's app over Wi-Fi. It has since developed products such as an FDA-cleared blood pressure monitor, a smart sleep system, and activity tracking watches. In 2016, Withings was acquired by Nokia and became a division of Nokia Health. The brand changed to the Nokia name in 2017. Throughout its history, Withings has had venture capital funding, formed partnerships with companies like MyFitnessPal, and integrated with Apple's HealthKit platform. The company continues to develop innovative health and wellness products and operates a factory in France as of April 2019. In 2024 it produced a new device, BeamO. This is a handheld \"multiscope\" with sensors to take health readings without being worn on the body. It can measure body temperature, heart health, lung health, and blood-oxygen levels. == References == Category:Technology companies of France Category:Biotechnology companies",
