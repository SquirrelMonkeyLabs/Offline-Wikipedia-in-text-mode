 "text": "Shiaphobia or Anti-Shi'ism (pronounced anti-SHE-ism) is hatred of Shia Muslims or prejudice against them. Shia Muslims make up somewhere between 15-20% of Muslims worldwide. Shortly after Muhammad's death, Sunni Islam and Shia Islam split because they disagreed on what type of person that could become a caliph: a top Muslim leader. Shias believe the leader should be related to the Prophet Muhammad. Sunnis, however, believe the leader should be chosen for his ability to lead the community. Journalists have noted that Shia and Sunni people lived together peacefully for centuries and even intermarried, but political upheaval has sparked new conflict between the two groups. Vali Nasr, an Iranian-American author and professor, has suggested that modern anti- Shi'ism violence is just a part of the overall conflict in the region, particularly due to the the collapse of authoritarian rule in the region.Nasr, Vali 2006.
