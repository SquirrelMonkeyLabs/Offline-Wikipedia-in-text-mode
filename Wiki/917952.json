 "text": "FreeCell is a Solitaire game that is played with a standard 52-card of playing cards. FreeCell is different from other solitaire games in the sense that all cards are face-up from the beginning of the game, which makes the outcome of the game depend more on skills than luck. To win the game, a player has to stack all cards onto four foundations, sorted by a cards suit and number, starting from the ace and ending with the king. FreeCell is considered to be one of the easier types of solitaire since the vast majority of games are winnable. ==References== Category:Card games",
