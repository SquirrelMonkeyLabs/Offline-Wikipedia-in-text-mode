Most of the victims were women travelling from the town of Songo- Doubacore to a market in the town of Bandiagara. The mayor of the closest town, Bankass, said that the gunmen shot the tires on the bus before going on to shoot the civilians to death. After the crime scene was visited by state security officers, they found 25 burnt bodies in the vehicle's trunk. The massacre happened on the same day that Islamist rebels attacked a group in the region, killing two UN peacekeepers. The attacks were part of a bigger campaign by jihadists in West Africa. == Reactions == Mali's president, Assimi Go√Øta, ordered all people in Mali to fly the country's flags at half-mast from Sunday to Tuesday, during which Mali would hold three national days of mourning. == References == Category:2021 crimes in Africa Category:2021 fires Category:Arson Category:Attacks on buses Category:December 2021 events Category:2020s in Mali Category:Mass murder in 2021 Category:2020s mass shootings in Africa Category:2021 mass shootings Category:Massacres in Africa Category:Terrorist incidents in Africa in the 2020s Category:Terrorist incidents in 2021",
