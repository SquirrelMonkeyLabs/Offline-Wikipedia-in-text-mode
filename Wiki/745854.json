 "text": "Klips ve Onlar was a Turkish band of the 1980s. They represented Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 with the song Halley, which reached 9th position. This was the highest position for Turkey at the time. The members of the group who won the Turkish finals were Sevingül Bahadır, Gür Akad, Emre Tukur, Derya Bozkurt and Seden Kutlubay. Kutlubay chose not to go to Eurovision (it was rumoured she had important exams in the week of the finals, and her boyfriend did not want her to go to Eurovision), so Candan Erçetin replaced her.
