 "text": "Coulomb's law is a function developed in the 1780s by physicist Charles- Augustin de Coulomb. It explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges. Electrostatic means electric charges without any motion. == Direction == Let's think of two electric charges existing in an empty space. If the two charges are opposite, (+) and (-) charges for example, they will attract each other. And if two charges are both the same, both (+) or both (-) for example, they will push each other. This is similar to how magnets act, as N and S attract each other, and as N and N, S and S push each other. This is because electric charges make an electric field. If two fields exist in the same space at the same time, then the two fields exert (~ put) force on each other. The force they make on each other is called 'Coulomb's force' or the electrostatic force. Coulomb's law explains how big the force will be. == Scale == Coulomb's law explains the scale between two electric charges. The scale of electrostatic force follows the function below. :F = {K_c}\\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} Coulomb's law explains that the force scale F is relative to ratio of q_1,q_2,\\frac{1}{r^2}. q_1 and q_2 are the scales of each electric charge. r is the distance between the two electric charges. And K_c has a certain value. It does not change relative to q_1, q_2 or r. While {K_c} remains constant, when multiples of q_1 and q_2 become bigger, the electrostatic force will also get bigger. When the distance r becomes bigger, the electrostatic force will become smaller by the ratio of \\frac{1}{r^2}. The exact size of K_c is \\begin{align} k_c &= 8.987\\ 551\\ 787\\ \\times 10^9 \\\\\\ \\end{align} \\approx 9 \\times 10^9N m2 C−2 (or m F−1). This constant is called Coulomb's force constant or the electrostatic force constant. == Inverse-square law == The relation between the force of pushing or pulling (F) and the distance between the particles (r) follows the Inverse-square Law. Inverse-square law means that when the distance r grows bigger, the force gets weaker by the ratio \\frac{1}{r^2}. Gravitation, Electromagnetic radiation, and sound loudness also follow this law. == Related pages == * Magnetic * Electrostatic * Coulomb, the SI unit of electric charge named after Charles- Augustin de Coulomb * Inverse-square law, the physical law that shows the relation between distance and Intensity. == Other websites == * Coulomb's Law on Project PHYSNET. * A maze game for teaching Coulomb's Law Category:Electricity Category:Laws of physics",
