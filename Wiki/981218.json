 "text": "Charles Kirby was a British inventor known for refining the manufacture of the fishing hook during the 1650s. Most notably, he created a hook that was named after him, the Kirby bend, popular in fish hooks used around the world. The hook design is shaped to have a point that is offset. Hook makers using Kirby's design went on to build manufacturing plants in Redditch more than seven decades later. Category:British inventors",
