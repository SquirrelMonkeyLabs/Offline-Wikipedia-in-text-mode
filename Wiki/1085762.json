He rose to the position of Minister of Justice and the Police in the cabinet of Prime Minister John Vorster from 1974 to 1979. He was also President of the Senate of South Africa from 1979 until 1980, when it was abolished. ==Background== Kruger was born in Bethlehem, Orange Free State, South Africa of Welsh parents and was adopted by Afrikaner parents.

Banning was a form of punishment used by the South African apartheid government, in which the person was forbidden to leave the area where he or she lived, forbidden to talk to the media, or was under house arrest. When Biko died after he was arrested by the police, the police said that he had died during a hunger strike, but Biko actually died after he was tortured by the police.Biko, p. 213 When this was challenged by the liberal white South African journalist Donald Woods, a personal friend of Biko, Kruger also had him banned.Donald Woods, South African Dispatches, pp. 167-168 Woods and his family fled the country for exile in England. When the actual cause of death of Biko became known, it caused an international scandal, and the South African government was embarrassed and put all the blame on Kruger. In 1980, the government ordered him to resign, and he lost not only his cabinet position, but his membership of the National Party, as well. In 1982, Kruger joined the newly founded hardline pro-apartheid Conservative Party of Andries Treurnicht in protest against the racial reforms of the National Party under the P. W.
