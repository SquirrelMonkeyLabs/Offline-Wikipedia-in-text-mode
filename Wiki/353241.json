 "text": "Gauss's law (or Gauss's flux theorem) is a law of physics. The law is about the relationship between electric charge and the resulting electric field. In words, Gauss's law states that: :The net electric flux through any closed surface is equal to times the net electric charge enclosed within that closed surface.A closed surface is one which is limited, but has no boundary. A sphere, for example. The law was created by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1835. However, it was not published until 1867. It is one of the four Maxwell's equations on classical electrodynamics. The other three are Gauss's law for magnetism, Faraday's law of induction, and Amp√®re's circuital law. == References == == Other websites == * MIT Video Lecture Series (30 x 50 minute lectures)- Electricity and Magnetism Taught by Professor Walter Lewin. *section on Gauss's law in an online textbook *MISN-0-132 Gauss's Law for Spherical Symmetry (PDF file) by Peter Signell for Project PHYSNET. *MISN-0-133 Gauss's Law Applied to Cylindrical and Planar Charge Distributions (PDF file) by Peter Signell for Project PHYSNET.
