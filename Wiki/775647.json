It is part of the canton of Luxembourg. As of 2021, 3,968 people in the commune of Contern but the town itself in the middle of the commune is home to 1743 people as of 2022. The other villages in Contern are Moutfort, Oetrange, Medingen and Milbech. Contern also has various hamlets == History == === Early History === The Romans settled the country of Luxembourg in the BC era and at some point a road was constructed between Luxembourg City and Dalheim. This road passed through what is today within the borders of the commune of Contern and also through the settlement of Faerschthaff. The Construction of this road saw a bridge of the Trudlerbaach River constructed, which still remains today. There is no proof that the settlement of Contern was founded during roman times, although it is widely believed so. The name Contern was first seen in a charter in 879/880/903/904 AD, although its first official listing was in 1128 and it is almost certain Contern dated back to the Celtic Era. In the 14th century it was wirtten as Guntrein. Contern in the 13th century got a lot of influence from Christianity and Chivalry. At this time Contern became a parish and has its church built. From 1945 onwards, Contern's municipal structure was made up of Contern, Oetrange, Moutfort and Medingen. The Commune of Contern has existed since the 19th century === Medieval History === ==== Formation of the Commune ==== Contern was formed as a parish in 1621. Later in 1684, neighbouring Oetrange became a parish and in 1707, Moutfort followed. At the time, the parish of Contern had no Lieu-dits although Oetrange was home to the settlement of Kackerterhaff. Moutfort was home to the setlements of Medingen and Millbech as well as the Moulin the Millbech and the farmstead of Pleitrange. By 1796 Contern was founded as an Arrondissement, this was home to several localities: Localities within the Arrondissement of Contern c.1800s Locality (French) Locality (German) Locality (Luxembourgish) Parish Brücherhof Brücherhof Bricherhaff None Brüchermühle Brichermillen None Contern Contern Conter or Konter Contern Contern-Barriére None Conterweyer None Kackerterhof Kackerterhaff Oetrange Kroentgeshof or Croentgeshof Kroentgeshof or Kröntgeshof Kréintgeshaff None Marxeknupp Marxeknupp None Medingen Medingen Méideng or Méidéng Moutfort Moutfort Mutfort Mutfert Moutfort Mühlbach Mühlbach Millbech or Milbech Moutfort Mühlbach-Moulin or Moulin de Millbech Millbechermillen or Milbechermillen Moutfort Oetrange Oetringen Éiter Oetrange Oetrange-Moulin Éitermillen None Pleitrange Pleitringen Pläitreng Moutfort Contern remained as an Arrondissement in the sense that it was formed in, in 1796 up until 1912, The exact time the commune as it is called today was formed is unknown, however the first census data from the commune dates back to 1821, so the commune is older than that. The parish of Oetrange was absorbed into the parish of Moutfort in 1946, shortly after in 1948, the parishes of Contern and Moutfort were effectively dissolved. ==== Early mentions of Commune and settlements ==== Early mentions in newspapers of Contern can be traced back to 1842, where it was mentioned in a long list of communes, although both the settlement and name have been seen far further back. Further mentions happened in 1844, following the death of John the Blind, signatures were collected from many communes, some came from Contern, it was document across multiple lists. === Recent Growth and Expansion === By 2001, the commune of Contern had a population of 3082, with the town itself having just 1065, the second largest in the commune. Also in 2001, Contern joined the Climate Alliance of European cities. === Archaeology === Although no prominent archaeological sites or artifacts date back to the Celtic times, plenty has been left over since the Romans including some housing and remnants of an aqueduct. The most prominent thing from the Romans however is the Gallo-Roman villa, it stood on the current site of the town and there are still remains of it to this day. === Etymology === Following World War II, the Luxembourgers had strong distaste for their former German overseers. This was why almost every place in the country was renamed from its original Luxembourgish name of German origin, to that of French origin without changing too much. Contern's name would have stayed Conter if it weren't for the French pronunciation of \"er\" being far too strong, thus an \"n\" was added on the end. It could have been possible to have followed what places like Hesperange did, but in the end it stuck to the name Contern. In the modern era, to encourage more Luxembougish in the commune, many documents and signs use \"Conter\" instead of Contern. === Pilgrimages === Conter has long been a target of many pilgrimages. In Contern, the sacred Walburga was offered to heal \"evil eyes\" or to do something against the \"evil gaze\". The Luxembourgish dialect poet Jakob Diedenhoven describes the course of these pilgrimages in an ironic way in 1830 in his prayer for Conter: : Zoo aalen Zeiten : Vun alle Seiten, : Zur Walburga, : Der heel'ger Fra : Gongen d'from Kreschten : Den Aelter reschten : Mat enger Kierz, : Engem selv'ren Hierz : Hier Aa'n ze g'nieren : Ville' mam Schmieren : Hoid se d'Gnood gin : 'Rem ze gesin. : Hei an der Scheier, : D'Marre mam Freier, : D'Ketche ma'm Franz : Sti'schon am Danz ... : He'r we se sangen, : Kuck we se sprangen, : Daat weist de Kne, : Daat eppes me. == Geography == === Overview === == Settlements == === Villages === === Lieu-dits === === Settlements === === Suburbs === === Industrial Zones === == Demographics == In 2020 the commune of Contern had a population of 3939, with a population density of around 188 people per square kilometer.
