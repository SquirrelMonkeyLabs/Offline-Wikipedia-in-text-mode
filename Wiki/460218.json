This movie is about five teenagers who met on Saturday. Somehow they deserved being in detention, but this is not that matters. Each of them is a part of a different high school clique. Being stereotypes, they all have some kind of problems with their parents, friends or school teachers. They forgot who they really are, because they hide behind masks. Spending Saturday together, they are starting to know each other better and then they realize that first of all each of them is a person. Unfortunately, other people do not see their personalities, they only see stereotypes. This fact makes them tired of life and entangled in thoughts. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1985 comedy-drama movies Category:1980s coming-of-age movies Category:1980s high school movies Category:1980s teen comedy movies Category:1980s teen drama movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:American coming-of-age movies Category:American high school movies Category:Coming-of-age comedy movies Category:Coming-of-age drama movies Category:Movies directed by John Hughes Category:Movies produced by John Hughes Category:Movies set in Chicago Category:Screenplays by John Hughes Category:Universal Pictures movies",
