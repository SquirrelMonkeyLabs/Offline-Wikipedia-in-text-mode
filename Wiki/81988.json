Caliban was found on 1997-09-06 by Brett J. Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale telescope together with Sycorax and given the designation S/1997 U 1. GLADMAN, NICHOLSON, BURNS, KAVELAARS, MARSDEN, WILLIAMS & OFFUTT Discovery of two distant irregular moons of Uranus, Nature, 392 (1998), pp. 897 - 899 Designated Uranus XVI it was named after the monster fictional character in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Stephano to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin. Grav, Tommy; Holman, Matthew J.; Gladman, Brett J.; Aksnes, Kaare Photometric survey of the irregular satellites,Icarus, 166 (2003), pp. 33-45. Preprint The diameter is estimated at 72 km (assuming albedo of 0.04), making it the second biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus, half the size of Sycorax, the biggest non- spherical moon of Uranus. The light curve suggests Caliban's rotation period is 2.7 hours. ==Related pages== *List of Uranus' moons ==References== *Ephemeris IAU-NSES *Mean orbital parameters NASA JPL ==Other websites== *Caliban Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration *David Jewiit pages *Scott Sheppard pages Category:Uranus' moons",
