 "text": "A censer is a container made for burning incense or perfume in some solid form. They are very ancient and have many different forms and are made out of many different materials. Many designs have holes to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer. In Western contexts, \"censer\" is often used for pieces made for religious use, especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely.The Regency Redingote, October, 2013 * == References == Category:Christian religious objects",
