 "text": "Michael Oliver (born 20 February 1985) is an English professional football referee from Ashington, Northumberland. His county FA is the Northumberland Football Association. He belongs to the Select Group of Referees in England and officiates primarily in the Premier League. He received his FIFA badge in 2012, allowing him to officiate in major international matches. Oliver was appointed to take charge of the final of the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Oliver was promoted to the UEFA Elite Group of Referees in 2018. He is also a Newcastle United supporter. ==Career== Born in Ashington, Northumberland, Oliver was introduced refereeing by his father, Clive, at the age of 14. He quickly progressed through the ranks and was promoted to the National List of Referees in 2007; he refereed the 2007 Conference National play-off Final, becoming the youngest football referee to officiate at Wembley Stadium. In addition he had already become the youngest Football League assistant referee, and would also become the youngest fourth official in the Premier League. Family Oliver enjoyed a unique refereeing double when father Clive took charge of the 2009 League Two play-off Final and Michael officiated the next day at the 2009 League One play-off Final. Some questions have been asked why Michael Oliver doesnâ€™t like to be sent to the monitor by the VAR ref after allegedly not seeing the clear foul on Liverpools Alexis Mac Allister even though it was right in front of him. The very strange behaviour and decision making from Oliver has resulted in the 23/24 PL title race taking a different trajectory. Odd,very odd.
