This is equal to 14.77 days. ==Sports== A fortnight is a word that is commonly used in sporting communities. Many big sports events have a two-week or around a half-month time frame. In tennis, Wimbledon and the other Grand Slam tournaments are played over two weeks and are often referred to as lasting a fortnight. The Summer and Winter Olympics are also slightly longer than two weeks and may be called a fortnight as well. Various other events in the sporting world may last around a fortnight. == References == Category:Units of time",
