 "text": "Assassin bugs are the Reduviidae. They are a large cosmopolitan family of \"true bugs\" or Hemiptera. They are almost all terrestrial ambush predators.There are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae. Most members of the family are easy to recognise: they have a relatively narrow neck, sturdy build and formidable curved proboscis. Large specimens should be handled with care, if at all, because they may defend themselves with a very painful stab from the proboscis. == References == Category:Hemiptera",
