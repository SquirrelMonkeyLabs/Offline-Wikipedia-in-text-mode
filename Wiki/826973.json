 "text": "Radio 101.2 was a radio station in Belarus. It worked from Minsk. In 1995 and 1996, the radio station used the frequency 101.2 FM. It was sent news and had no connection to the government of Belarus. The people who worked at the Radio 101.2 mostly came from the radio station Belarusian Youth () that had been forced to go out of business. Soros Foundation helped to buy the things for the new radio in 1995. The station was closed on formally technical reasons. Its frequency was handed over to the Belarusian Republican Youth Union, which still uses it today. The Belarussian government said that the radio station and its frequency were interfering with the radio communications of the Minsk police. Independent groups said that this was another form to stop the freedom of the press in Belarus by the government of Alexander Lukashenko. Music judge Dzmitry Padbiarezski said in 2000 that the Belarusian radio 101.2 had high public interest because it played good music and its DJs were experts too. == Related pages == * Autoradio == References == == Other websites == * 15 гадоў таму ўпершыню выйшла ў эфір Радыё 101.2 Category:Radio stations in Belarus Category:Censorship in Belarus",
