 "text": "The NBA G League, or Gatorade League, is the National Basketball Association's officially sponsored and operated developmental basketball organization. When the league was formed in 2001, it was called the National Basketball Development League (NBDL). In 2005, it entered into a formal relationship with the NBA and became the NBA Development League, or D-League. After the 2016–17 season, the NBA entered a sponsorship deal with PepsiCo's Gatorade brand of sports drinks; the league first called itself the \"Gatorade League\", but settled on \"G League\", reflecting Gatorade's use of a single large \"G\" as its brand logo. ==2025–26 teams== NBA G League NBA G League NBA G League NBA G League Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Eastern Conference Team City Pod NBA Affiliate Birmingham Squadron Birmingham, AL South New Orleans Pelicans Capital City Go-Go Washington, DC East Washington Wizards Cleveland Charge Cleveland, OH Central Cleveland Cavaliers College Park Skyhawks College Park, GA East Atlanta Hawks Delaware Blue Coats Wilmington, DE East Philadelphia 76ers Grand Rapids Gold Grand Rapids, MI Central Denver Nuggets Greensboro Swarm Greensboro, NC South Charlotte Hornets Long Island Nets Uniondale, NY East Brooklyn Nets Maine Celtics Portland, ME East Boston Celtics Motor City Cruise Detroit, MI Central Detroit Pistons Noblesville Boom Noblesville, IN Central Indiana Pacers Osceola Magic Kissimmee, FL South Orlando Magic Raptors 905 Mississauga, ON East Toronto Raptors Westchester Knicks White Plains, NY East New York Knicks Windy City Bulls Hoffman Estates, IL Central Chicago Bulls Wisconsin Herd Oshkosh, WI Central Milwaukee Bucks Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Western Conference Team City Pod NBA Affiliate Austin Spurs Cedar Park, TX South San Antonio Spurs Capitanes de Ciudad de México Mexico City, Mexico South None Iowa Wolves Des Moines, IA Central Minnesota Timberwolves Memphis Hustle Southaven, MS South Memphis Grizzlies Oklahoma City Blue Oklahoma City, OK West Oklahoma City Thunder Rio Grande Valley Vipers Edinburg, TX South Houston Rockets Rip City Remix Portland, OR West Portland Trail Blazers Salt Lake City Stars West Valley City, UT West Utah Jazz San Diego Clippers Oceanside, CA West Los Angeles Clippers Santa Cruz Warriors Santa Cruz, CA West Golden State Warriors Sioux Falls Skyforce Sioux Falls, SD Central Miami Heat South Bay Lakers El Segundo, CA West Los Angeles Lakers Stockton Kings Stockton, CA West Sacramento Kings Texas Legends Frisco, TX South Dallas Mavericks Valley Suns Tempe, AZ TBA Phoenix Suns G League Category:Basketball leagues Category:2001 establishments in the United States",
