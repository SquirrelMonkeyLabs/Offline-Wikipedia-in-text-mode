 "text": "There are no indepth details of this reconquest but according to a Jain text, after the death of Emperor Ashoka, the regions of Saurashtra, Maharashtra, Andhra, and Mysore became independent during the reign of his successor, Dasharatha. Later, these areas were brought back under control by Samprati, who is said to have sent soldiers disguised as Jain monks to help regain the territories. Samprati sent missionaries along with his soldiers, likely of the Svetambara tradition, to South India with the goal of expanding Jainism into less civilized regions and reconquering the previously lost areas. These missionaries, disguised as Jaina monks, traveled to the area and instructed the local people on the types of food and items that monks could accept as alms. They encouraged the people to offer these items to the monks instead of paying the usual taxes to the revenue collectors who would come periodically. In reality, these revenue collectors were also Jaina monks. Having set the groundwork, Samprati then persuaded his religious superiors to send actual monks to these regions, believing they would be able to live there without difficulty. As a result, Jain missionaries were dispatched to the Andhras and Dravidians, who found the conditions just as the king had described. Thus, Jainism spread among these previously uncivilized communities. == References == Category:India Category:South India",
