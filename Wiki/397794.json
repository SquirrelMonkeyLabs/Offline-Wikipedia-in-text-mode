The town was renamed to the City of Sugar Hill in 1975. Before Sugar Hill was a town, the area was part of a road that went from a railroad stop in Buford, Georgia to the city of Cumming, Georgia. Sugar Hill was named when a large shipment of sugar spilled along the route, and people started calling the area \"the hill where the sugar spilled\" or \"the sugar hill\". ==References== Category:Gwinnett County, Georgia Category:Cities in Georgia (U.S. state)",
