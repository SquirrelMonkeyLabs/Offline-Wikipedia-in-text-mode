 "text": "Ely College is a secondary school located in Ely, Cambridgeshire. == History == In 1957, Ely High School for Girls moved out of the centre of Ely to Downham Road. A primary school was built around the same time. In 1969 a charity donation meant a secondary school was built. In 1972 these schools became the City of Ely Community College. It was re-named Ely College in 2011. In 2011 Ely College became an Academy. It joined the Cfbt Trust in 2012. It then joined the CMAT Trust in 2016 instead. ==CMAT and the House System== CMAT was formed in 2011. The Trust began as Cambridge Meridian Education Trust (CMET) in 2009. The trust started with Swavesey Village College. In 2011 CMET became Cambridge Meridian Academies Trust (CMAT). This meant it could have more academies. Ely College is organised into four 'Houses'. Each of them have around 250 students and 30 staff. They are named Etheldreda, Scott, Franklin and Turing. This system is used in many of the CMAT academies. ==Bishop Laney== Bishop Laney Sixth Form is on the same site as the College. It used to be called Ely College Sixth Form.
