 "text": "The Violin Concerto in E major, BWV 1042, is a violin concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach. It follows the three-movement Venetian concerto style but includes some \"un-Italian characteristics\" in each movement. The piece has three movements: #Allegro, meter of , in ritornello form in E major #Adagio, meter of , with a ground bass in C-sharp minor #Allegro assai, meter of , with an overall structure of a rondo in E major There are two 18th-century scores, but neither is an oryginal manuscript (handwritten original document). Bach re-used the concerto as a model for his Harpsichord Concerto in D major, BWV 1054. This version was found in his 1737–39 oryginal manuscript of these works. The concerto is believed to have been written while Bach was working for the court of Köthen or during his time in Leipzig. ==References== ==Other websites== * Bach Violin Concerto in E major Category:Compositions in E major",
