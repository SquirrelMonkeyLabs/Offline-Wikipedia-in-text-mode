 "text": "A smart bomb or smart ammunition is a kind of weapon that is able to hit a target more precisely. It will therefore do more damage to the intended target, and ideally, there will be less collateral damage. Officially, these bombs are called Precision-guided munition, or PGM. Such ammunition or bombs have the ability to influence their course, after they have been launched. Usually, such weapons have sensors, for example for: * Detecting their position, for example by using GPS. * detecting light, infrared or radar signals * Empennage (also called tail assembly) that allows them to change their course * A battery, as a source of energy. During the First Gulf War guided munitions were only 9% of weapons fired, but they accounted for 75% of all successful hits. Despite guided weapons generally being used on more difficult targets, they were still 35 times more likely to destroy their targets per weapon dropped. == References == Category:Missiles",
