 "text": "A tractor is a work vehicle used for farming and construction. It usually has a seat for only the driver, and can be used to pull many different tools or trailers. Most tractors use big wheels, but some use rubber tracks to spread their weight over a large area. This is useful for farmers in places with very soft or muddy ground where a tractor with wheels might get stuck. ==References== Category:Land vehicles Category:Agricultural machinery Category:Construction Category:Machines",
