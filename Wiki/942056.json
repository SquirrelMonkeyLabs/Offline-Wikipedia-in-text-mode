 "text": "SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates natively with Microsoft Office. Launched in 2001, SharePoint is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and its usage varies substantially among organizations. According to Microsoft, SharePoint had 200 million users. == History == === Origins === SharePoint evolved from projects codenamed \"Office Server\" and \"Tahoe\" during the Office XP development cycle. \"Office Server\" evolved out of the FrontPage and Office Server Extensions and \"Team Pages\". It targeted simple, bottom-up collaboration. \"Tahoe\", built on shared technology with Exchange and the \"Digital Dashboard\", targeted top-down portals, search and document management. The searching and indexing capabilities of SharePoint came from the \"Tahoe\" feature set. The search and indexing features were a combination of the index and crawling features from the Microsoft Site Server family of products and from the query language of Microsoft Index Server. GAC-(Global Assembly Cache) is used to accommodate the shared assemblies that are specifically designated to be shared by applications executed on a system. === Versions === Successive versions (in chronological order): * Office Server Extensions * SharePoint Portal Server 2001 * SharePoint Team Services * Windows SharePoint Services 2.0 (free license) * SharePoint Portal Server 2003 * Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (free license) * Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007 * SharePoint Foundation 2010 (free), SharePoint Server 2010 (commercial extension for Foundation), and SharePoint Enterprise 2010 (commercial extension for Server) * SharePoint Foundation 2013 (free), SharePoint Server 2013 (extension on top of Foundation), and SharePoint Enterprise 2013. * SharePoint Online (Plan 1 & 2). * SharePoint Server 2016 and SharePoint Enterprise 2016. * SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Enterprise 2019. === Notable changes in SharePoint 2010 === Changes in end- user functionality added in the 2010 version of SharePoint include: * New UI with Fluent Ribbon, using wiki-pages rather than 'web-part pages' and offering multi-browser support. * New social profiles, and early social networking features * Central Administration rebuilt. * Restructure of \"Shared Service Providers\" - Introduction of \"Service Applications\" SOA model. * Sandboxed Solutions and a client-side object-model APIs for JavaScript, Silverlight, and .NET applications * Business Connectivity Services, Claims-based Authentication, and Windows PowerShell support === Notable changes in SharePoint 2013 === * Cross-browser drag & drop support for file uploads/changes, and Follow/Share buttons * OneDrive for Business (initially SkyDrive Pro) replaces MySites and Workspaces. * Updates to social network feature & new task aggregation tool. * Database caching, called Distributed Cache ServiceHow-To Videos - Microsoft Office.
