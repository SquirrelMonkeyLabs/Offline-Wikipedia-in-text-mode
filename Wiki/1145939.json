 "text": "The Politics of San Marino takes place within the framework of a unitary, parliamentary republic that emphasizes both democratic representation and a unique dual head of state system. The Republic of San Marino, one of the world’s oldest republics, maintains a strong commitment to its democratic traditions through its distinctive institutions and practices. == Government structure == San Marino’s government is structured around three branches: the executive, legislative, and judiciary, which function within a constitutional framework that blends both written and customary laws. === Executive branch === The executive power is vested in the Congress of State, which serves as the government of San Marino. The Congress of State is responsible for implementing laws, managing public policy, and overseeing administrative functions. It is led by a group of secretaries who manage different portfolios, including foreign affairs, finance, and health. ==== Captains Regent ==== The Captains Regent serve as the dual heads of state in San Marino. Elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, the Captains Regent are responsible for representing San Marino and presiding over government meetings. This practice dates back to the medieval period and symbolizes San Marino's longstanding tradition of shared leadership. === Legislative branch === The Grand and General Council is San Marino’s unicameral legislature. Composed of 60 members elected through proportional representation, the council holds legislative power, approves the budget, and has the authority to enact laws. It also appoints the Captains Regent, who serve as the ceremonial heads of state. The council members serve five-year terms and represent various political parties in San Marino. == Judiciary == San Marino’s judiciary operates independently of the executive and legislative branches. The legal system is partially derived from customary law, but it has been modernized over the years. The Guarantors' Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules acts as the constitutional court, ensuring that all laws comply with the constitutional principles of San Marino. The judiciary also includes a network of lower courts that address civil and criminal matters. == Political parties and elections == San Marino has a multi-party system characterized by coalition governments. Elections to the Grand and General Council are held every five years, and members are elected through a proportional representation system. The largest parties include the Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and several smaller parties and alliances. Coalition building is a significant feature of San Marino's politics due to the proportional representation system.https://omannews.gov.om/topics/en/79/show/118800/ona === Recent elections === The most recent general election was held in 2019, resulting in a coalition government. The next election is scheduled for 2024. == Constitutional framework == San Marino’s constitutional framework is a combination of written statutes and centuries-old customs. The legal system respects democratic principles and adheres to the Statutes of 1600, one of the world’s oldest governing documents still in effect. == Foreign relations == San Marino maintains friendly relations with other nations and is a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the European Union (observer status). Its foreign policy emphasizes neutrality, cooperation, and the preservation of San Marino's independence. == Related pages == * Captains Regent * Grand and General Council * Guarantors' Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules * Constitution of San Marino == References ==",
