 "text": "Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom (English: My Name Is Yu Ming) is a 2003 Irish short film. Yu Ming goes to Ireland, where most of the population do not know Irish. It was directed by Daniel O'Hara and is 13 minutes in length. ==Plot== Yu Ming (Diyu Daniel Wu) hates his job at a supermarket in China. He chooses to move to Ireland because a globe he spun in a library landed on it. He learns \"Gaelic\" for 6 months first because an atlas says it is Ireland's official language. He asks an Australian receptionist in a Dublin hostel \"Ba mhaith liom leaba anseo\" (\"I would like a bed here\"). Thinking it is Chinese, he asks Enke, an Asian co-worker, to translate it. He says, \"I am Mongolian.\" Yu Ming asks a bartender \"Tá mé ag lorg obair\" (\"I am looking for work\"). He also thinks he is speaking Chinese. Paddy (Frank Kelly), an old man, can speak Irish, so he buys him a drink and tells him he is able to speak Irish. Yu Ming now works as a bartender in the Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking) area of Connemara. The line \"An bhfuil tusa ag labhairt liomsa?\" (\"Are you talking to me?\") is said multiple times throughout the film. ==Cast== *Diyu Daniel Wu as Yu Ming *Frank Kelly as Paddy *Paddy C.
