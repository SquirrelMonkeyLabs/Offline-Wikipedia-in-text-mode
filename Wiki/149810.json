 "text": "Shaktoolik is a city in Alaska. Shaktoolik is a very old settlement in Alaska, started by the Malemiut people. People lived there as early as 1839. It was the first and most southern Malemiut place on Norton Sound. Nearby, about 12 miles away at Cape Denbigh, is a place called Iyatayet. People lived there a very, very long time ago, between 6,000 and 8,000 years. It's so old and important that it's on a special list of historic places. A Russian explorer named Lt. Lavrenty Zagoskin wrote about Shaktoolik on maps around 1842â€“1844. He called it \"Tshaktogmyut.\" The name \"Shaktoolik\" comes from a local word meaning \"scattered things.\" Category:Cities in Alaska",
