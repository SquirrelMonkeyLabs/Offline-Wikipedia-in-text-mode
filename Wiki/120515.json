 "text": "Triple J is a radio station from Australia. It is funded and owned by the Australian Government through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The music played by the station is aimed at youth (usually between 12 and 25 years old) and is usually alternative music. The station started in 1972 as \"Double Jay\" in Sydney. It can now be heard all around Australia. Triple J (stylised in all lowercase) is a government-funded, national Australian radio station that began broadcasting in 1975 as a division of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). It aims to appeal to young listeners of alternative music, and plays more Australian content than commercial networks. The station was set up under the Gough Whitlam government, wanting to extend the appeal of the ABC to young Australians. Initially broadcasting as 2JJ or Double Jay from 19 January 1975, it stood apart from commercial stations with its lack of private advertising and its programming of mainly local music often censored or banned elsewhere. Following a transition to FM in 1981, the station rebranded as 2JJJ or Triple J as it expanded regionally through the 1990s. From 2014, the spin- off digital radio station Double J was launched to appeal to more contemporary audiences. Triple J used to dominate national ratings in the 25â€“39 demographic, but since 2015 has been losing its audience due to the rise of streaming media. ==References== ==Other websites== *Triple J homepage Category:Radio stations Category:Australian culture",
