 "text": "The Indianapolis Indians are a Minor League Baseball team from Indianapolis, Indiana. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Indians are partnered with the Pittsburgh Pirates, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the Pirates. The team is named \"Indians\" because of the similarity between that name and the named of their state, Indiana. However, the team also uses Native American (or \"Indian\") themes in their logos. The Indians have played at a stadium called Victory Field since 1996. Before this, they played at Owen J. Bush Stadium from 1931 to 1996 and at two stadiums called Washington Park from 1902 to 1931. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1900s establishments in the United States Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Indianapolis Category:Pittsburgh Pirates",
