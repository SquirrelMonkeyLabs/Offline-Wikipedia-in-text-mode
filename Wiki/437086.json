 "text": "The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE or ATF) is a federal law enforcement group. The ATF became its own organization on January 17, 2003, after it was proposed in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. They are a branch of the United States Department of Justice. The ATF actively prevents dangerous criminals and criminal organizations from illegally trafficking firearms and explosives, illegal storage of explosives, arson, bombings, and acts of arson, as well as stopping the illegal sale of alcohol and tobacco. == Waco Siege (1993) == In 1993, the ATF executed an operation in Waco, Texas, known as the Waco Siege, along with the FBI, the Texas Rangers, the Texas Military Forces, and the Alabama National Guard. Their goal was to serve a search warrant issued by the ATF on a religious cult known as the \"Branch Davidians.\" The location of the siege was a building complex known as Mount Carmel Center ranch, in McLennan County, Texas, slightly north of Waco. The reason for the warrant was because of suspected weapons violations. The aftermath of the Waco Siege and the force used during it by federal agents is still disputed to this day. ==References== Category:Federal law enforcement agencies of the United States",
