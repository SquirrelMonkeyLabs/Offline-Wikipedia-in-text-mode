 "text": "Paracelsus (11 November or 17 December 1493 in Einsiedeln, Switzerland – 24 September 1541 in Salzburg, Austria) was a Swiss-Austrian alchemist, physician, astrologer, and general occultist. The name \"Paracelsus\" was a nickname: it means \"equal to or greater than Celsus\", and refers to his medical skill.Read J. 1961. Through alchemy to chemistry. London: Bell. He was born Phillip von Hohenheim.A longer version is Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim. It seems unclear which version was the original name given at his christening. He gained his doctorate degree from the University of Ferrara in 1515 or 1516.Schaber, Johannes 1993. Bautz, Traugott. ed (in German). Paracelsus, lat. Pseudonym von {Philippus Aureolus} Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim. Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon (BBKL). 6. Herzberg. cols. 1502–1528. . He gave zinc its name (in Latin as \"zincum\").. He also named the cyanobacterium Nostoc, which is a long-chain colonial bacterium. The adjective \"bombastic\" comes from his family name. It refers to his arrogance. Paracelsus was responsible for the creation of laudanum, an alcoholic herbal opium preparation. It was in common use up to the 19th century. Like most of the alchemists, he was a notable botanist. He wrote various books, but especially his major work (title translated as: On the miners' sickness and other diseases of miners). This listed the occupational hazards of metalworking, including treatment and prevention strategies. He also wrote a book on the human body which contradicted Galen's ideas. He disagreed with Galen's idea of four humours, and instead believed that disease could come from an external source. == Works == === During his lifetime === * Die große Wundarzney, 1536. *Vom Holz Guaico, 1529. *Vonn dem Bad Pfeffers in Oberschwytz gelegen, 1535. *Prognostications, 1536. === Selected translations === *The Hermetic and Alchemical writings of Paracelsus.
