 "text": "A temporal paradox, is a time paradox, or time travel paradox. It is a paradox, or logical contradiction, of time and time travel. Temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups. Consistency paradoxes (example: the grandfather paradox) and causal loops. A causal loop is a paradox of time travel. It occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn is the cause of the future event. Both events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be known. == Not a paradox == Fermi's so-called paradox is not a paradox, just a question. It does not involve logic, just the practical (empirical) fact that stellar distances are so great, and our ability to collect data from other bodies is limited. == References == Category:Logical paradoxes",
