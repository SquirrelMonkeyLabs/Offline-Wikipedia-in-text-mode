 "text": "Philautus erythrophthalmus is a frog. It lives in Malaysia and Indonesia. People have seen it between 1,000 and 1,550 m meters above sea level. This frog lives in oak forests, but scientists have seen at least one in a place where all the trees had been cut down. Scientists believe this frog hatches out of eggs as small frogs and never swims as a tadpole, but they are not sure. This frog is in danger of dying out because people cut down trees to make farms to grow palm oil and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
