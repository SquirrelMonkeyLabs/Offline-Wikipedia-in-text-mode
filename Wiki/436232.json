 "text": "The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and museum. It was constructed in honor and to remember the life and achievements of the 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy. It is located in Boston, Massachusetts. It was designed by the architect I. M. Pei. It was opened to the public on October 20, 1979 and was rededicated on October 23, 1993. On April 15, 2013, a fire began in the library. At first, reports said the fire appears to have started in a mechanical room. An official communication from the library stated that the fire is being investigated. At this time, the fire appears to be unrelated to the Boston Marathon bombings that occurred on the same day. ==References== ==Other websites== * JFK Library and Museum * JFK Library and Museum Online Store Category:John F.
