 "text": "Breaking Hearts is the eighteenth studio album by British singer-songwriter Elton John, released in 1984. It features the quartet of John, Davey Johnstone, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson. There were two hit singles from the album: the US #5 hit \"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\" and the UK No. 5 hit \"Passengers\". This was the last studio album until 2001's Songs from the West Coast to feature Olsson on drums. It was also the last where John played both piano and keyboards in the studio solo. There was a backup keyboard player for each album moving forward. Breaking Hearts was also the first album since Victim of Love not to feature a string or horn section on any track. This is one of only two albums with John's classic band where Ray Cooper was not part of the lineup, the other being 1973's Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player. Shortly after the tour, the band's line-up would change and Gus Dudgeon, John's former producer, produced the next two albums. In the United States it was certified gold in September 1984 and platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA. Category:Elton John albums Category:1984 albums",
