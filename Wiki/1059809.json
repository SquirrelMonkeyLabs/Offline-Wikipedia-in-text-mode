 "text": "Asanka's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus sordidus) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. People have seen it between 810 and 1830 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 21.2 â€“ 23.4 mm long from nose to rear end. There is extra skin on the toes of the front feet and webbed skin on the toes of the back feet. The skin of the frog's back is ash-brown in color. The toes of all four feet, parts of the legs, and the belly are yellow in color. Parts of the frog's middle and back legs have small yellow spots. This frog lives in small woody plants that live in places where the sunlight reaches partway to the forest floor. Like other frogs in Pseudophilautus, it does not swim as a tadpole. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. Scientists used to think that this frog and P. hoffmani were two different species, but they changed their minds in 2021. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
