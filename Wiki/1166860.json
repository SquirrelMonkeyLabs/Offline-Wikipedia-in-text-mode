The frog lives in at least one protected park, Floresta Nacional de Caraj√°s. ==Young== The male frog sits on rocks or leaves and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays her eggs on leaves. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. Some of these frogs live in places where people cut down forests to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
