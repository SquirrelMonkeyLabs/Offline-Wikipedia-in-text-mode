These battles occurred between October 9, 1879, and January 8, 1880, and included: *Velika attacks (October 9 – November 22, 1879): Montenegrin victory in the first attack; Albanian victory in the second. *Battle of Novšiće (December 4, 1879): Albanian victory. *Battle of Murino (January 8, 1880): Both sides claimed victory. *Battle at the Ržanica Bridge (April 22, 1880): Albanian victory. == Conflict == The League of Prizren's forces were led by commanders such as Ali Pasha of Gusinje and Jakup Ferri, while Montenegro's forces included battalions from Moračani, Bratonožići, Kuči, and Vasojevići. The conflicts resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with over 649 irregulars and more than 2,000 soldiers killed. These battles were part of the broader resistance by Albanian forces against the decisions of the Congress of Berlin, which sought to redraw boundaries in the Balkans without local consent.\"Memoari vojvode Gavra Vukovića\" by Gavro Vuković and Slobodan Tomović, 1996. \"Dva Petrovića Njegoša: Vladika Danilo Petrović\", 1896. \"Istorijski zapisi\", Historical Institute in Titograd, 1982. \"Cjelokupna djela\" by King Nikola I, 1969. == References == Category:Battles",
