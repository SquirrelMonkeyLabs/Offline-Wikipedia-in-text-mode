 "text": "Baked beans is a dish made of beans, sometimes baked but, despite the name, usually stewed, in a sauce. Most commercially canned baked beans are made from haricot beans, also known as navy beans (a variety of Phaseolus vulgaris) in a sauce. ==Varieties== In Ireland and the United Kingdom, a tomato sauce is most commonly used, and they are commonly eaten on toasted white bread or as part of a full English, Scottish, or Irish Breakfast. Some Americans have been known to dislike the dish. ==References== Category:Bean dishes Category:British food Category:Canned food",
