 "text": "On March 26, 2024, at 01:27 EDT (05:27 UTC), the main parts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, across the Patapsco River in Baltimore Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland, United States, collapsed after the Singaporean container ship Dali struck one of its support pillars. At least seven vehicles fell into the water. Two people were recovered from the river, one person had no injuries while the other was in \"very serious condition\". Six members of a construction crew were working on the roadway when it collapsed are missing, presumed dead. Three bodies have been found. President Joe Biden was briefed about the collapse, and in an address later that day, said that he would ask Congress to help pay for the bridge's reconstruction. Before the collapse, a mayday (panic) call was made by the ship, telling the Maryland Department of Transportation that a collision with the bridge was possible. ==References== Category:March 2024 events Category:Transport disasters in the United States Category:2024 disasters in the United States Category:History of Baltimore Category:21st century in Maryland",
