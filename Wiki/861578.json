It also deals with people and situations within Caribbean societies. ==Subject== Caribbean philosophy often asks questions about race, slavery, freedom, emancipation, gender issues, and decolonization. Caribbean philosophy examines thought practices in other fields such as literature, music, and historical writings. Afro-Caribbean philosophers write about the Afro- Caribbean intellectual tradition. Caribbean philosophical texts are written in several languages such as English, and French, Spanish. For example,José Martí and Eugenio María de Hostos wrote in Spanish about Cuban and Puerto Rican independence. Caribbean women philosophers include Ofelia Schutte, Sylvia Wynter, and Giannina Braschi. They write on many different subjects including racism, sexism, economy, and oppression. American and Latin American philosophy receive more academic attention than Caribbean philosophy. To combat that, the Caribbean Philosophical Association was founded on June 14, 2003 in Mona, Jamaica. ==Experts== === Cuban philosophers === * Rafael García Bárcena * Jorge J. E.
