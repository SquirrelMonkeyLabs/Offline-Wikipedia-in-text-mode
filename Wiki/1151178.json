Hamvira Deva successfully took control of the capital city of Vijayanagara, forcing its weak emperor, Mallikarjuna Raya, to pay an annual tribute. In 1460 CE, Hamvira Deva's general, Tamavupala, captured the southern regions of Udayagiri and Chandragiri. Inscriptions from the Srirangam Temple near Trichinapalli state that Hamvira Deva's conquests reached as far south as Trichinapalli, Tanjore, and Arcot before he halted his advance. In 1464 CE, Hamvira Deva’s son, Dakshina Kapileswara Kumara, was appointed governor of the southern territories, including Chandragiri, after its conquest. By 1464 CE, Kapilendra Deva ruled over a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River in the north to Trichinapalli in the south. This gave him the right to adopt the imperial titles of Gajapati, Gauḍeśvara, Navakoṭi Karṇāṭa, and Kalavargeśvara. Historian R. C. Majumdar stated that Kapilendra Deva was the most powerful Hindu king of his time, and under his rule, Odisha became an empire stretching from the lower Ganges in the north to the Kaveri River in the south. The Gopinathpur inscription from 1464 CE clearly describes his powerful position. == References == Category:India",
