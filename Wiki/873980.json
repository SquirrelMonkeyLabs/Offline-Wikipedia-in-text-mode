But because the snow has melted, there is nothing fun to do in their town. They try to play winter games: They make a snowman out of dirt and push a sled down a grassy hill. But these games do not work without snow, and the boys are bored. The only fun thing to do is fireworks, but the government of Colorado has made them illegal.
