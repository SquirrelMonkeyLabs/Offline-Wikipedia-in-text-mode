 "text": "Riya is an Islamic term that refers to one's worship to be seen by people. It is an Islamic term for someone who does something with the intention of being seen by people, or to be a good person, or to please people and not to please God. Hypocrisy is used in contrast to sincerity of action. A similar term is \"fame\" which refers to the worship of a person so that people can hear his mention and make it known so that he is remembered for it.See Lisan al-Arab 8/166 by Ibn Manzur, Majma Bihar al-Anwar by Jamal al-Din al-Hindi al-Fitni 3/66, Sharah al-Umda by Ibn Taymiyyah p. 577. One of the biggest things against the perception of slavery is: hypocrisy and reputation. Hypocrisy is doing things so that people can see them, and fame is mentioning things so that people can hear them. == definition == In language, its root word is: “ر Alif YA” and its origin is to gain dignity in the hearts of people by displaying good qualities, so it means: “to show good deeds with the intention that they are for people. Ibn Manzur said: \"Abu Mansur said: The saying of God Almighty: and His saying: ; this is not for advice, but it means that people see them not praying, and if they see praying in Islam then [almost]| from this Almighty: \"for pride and showing off,\" which he Show the people, but he does not do it with right intention, I see, it is for hypocrisy and fame.\"لسان العرب لابن منظور ج6 ص68 حرف الراء «رأي» رابط الصفحة ==Warning against hypocrisy and reputation in Islam == Muslim scholars believe that sincerity in worshiping Allah in word and deed and according to the Sunnah is included in righteous deeds as pleasing to Allah. Among the things that oppose and nullify this good deed are: hypocrisy and fame, so he associates himself with Allah in this worship and falls under the threat and wrath of Allah with no reward left for him. Allah Almighty says: Say, 'I am a human being like you. It was revealed to me that your God is one God. So whoever desires to meet his Lord, let him do righteous deeds and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord. - Kahf: 110, Ibn Zubair said, Sa'id Ibn Zubair said about the meaning of \"does not associate anyone with the worship of his Lord\": \"That is, does not show himself to anyone in the worship of his Lord.\"راجع الدر المنثور في التفسير بالمأثور لجلال الدين السيوطي 5/469. In the Holy Hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah (RA), Allah Ta'ala said: The Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: \"Allah Ta'ala said: I am the freest of partners.أخرجه مسلم برقم (2985). The Sunnah of the Prophet mentions the description of one who makes his worship known so that people can hear him and the description of its consequences. It is narrated in Sahih Al-BukhariSahih al-Bukhari No. (6499). and Muslim.صحيح مسلم البرقم (2986). The meaning of the hadith is: A person who does something without sincerity, but only wants people to see and hear him, will be rewarded for it by Allah making him famous, humiliating him and revealing what he was hiding.Al-Khattabi mentioned this and Muhammad al-Karmani quoted him in al- Kawaqib al-Duraari in his commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari 23/20. Similarly, a person who demonstrates to people through his actions, thereby demonstrates to God, meaning: he makes them aware that he did it for them, and he did not do it for Him, the Almighty, and thus he deserves God's wrath and painful punishment for it.See: Ibn Battal's commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari 10/208. ==References== Category:Islamic terminology Category:Hypocrisy Category:Sin Category:Polytheism",
