 "text": "The Awa rocket frog (Hyloxalus awa) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog can be as big as 16.1–22.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be 19.1–25.9 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is reddish-brown in color with darker marks. There are white spots on the belly. The male frog has a gray throat and the female frog has white spots The sides of the body are dark gray in color. Most frogs have a stripe down the side. The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Name== Scientists named this frog awa for the Awa people. The Awa people live in one of the same places as the frog. The word \"Awa\" means \"people.\" ==Home== This frog lives in forests on hills where there is water in the air. Scientists saw these frogs between 40 and 1327 meters above sea level in Ecuador. Scientists saw the frog two protected parks: Reserva Ecológica Manglares Cayapas Mataje, Refugio de Vida Silvestre Manglares Estuario del Río Muisne, Reserva Ecológica Mache- Chindul, Reserva Ecológica Cotacachi-Cayapas, Refugio de Vida Silvestre El Pambilar, Reserva Ecológica Los Ilinizas. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground or on small plants. After the eggs hatch, adult frogs carry the tadpoles to streams. The tadpoles swim in pools on the sides of streams where the water moves slowly. ==Danger== Scientists say the frog is not in danger of dying out because many of them are alive now and because their home is big. The only things that hurt this frog are bad chemicals and if people change the places where it lives to make farms, get wood to build with, and let animals eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
