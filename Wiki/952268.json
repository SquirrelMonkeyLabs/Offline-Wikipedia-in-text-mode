In this year the Football Federation accused the team of trying to buy players from other teams and they were financial irregularities and the team did not want to divide its winnings from the UEFA cup with the league. So they were kicked out of the First Division for seven years. == Honours == *Campionat de Lliga: 1 *: 1999–00 *Copa Constitució: 1 *: 1999–00 == References == Category:Andorran football clubs",
