Fraud often starts by saying there is a free or low-price item. The fraudster then asks for personal information, such as a home address and bank account numbers. Instead of giving an item in return, the fraudster takes their money. Fraudsters often target senior citizens. Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes are forms of investment fraud. In 2009 Bernie Madoff was charged for defrauding over 40,800 people in a $64 billion Ponzi scheme. The scheme has been described as \"the largest fraudulent scheme in history\" and \"one of the most prolific financial crimes in American history‚Äù. Some fraudsters use ransomware and/or phishing to gather private information from their victims. == Laws == Fraud is a criminal wrong: a fraudster may be prosecuted and imprisoned. It is also a civil wrong: a fraud victim may sue the fraudster to get compensation. Laws against fraud differ in each jurisdiction. === England === In England an Act of Parliament defines three kinds of fraud. #fraud by false representation, #fraud by failing to disclose information, and #fraud by abuse of position.
