Though sent into subspace by the scientists' sacrifice, Messiah's actions established the formation of the Energy Management Center's Special Ops Unit from three children who were caught in the crossfire, the Go-Busters, and their Buddyroids. In the present, 2012 NCE, a mysterious figure named Enter leads a group called Vaglass on incursions to gather enough Enetron to bring Messiah back. However, training for this day, the Go-Busters and their Buddyroids are deployed to combat Vaglass's Metaroids and Megazords to protect the city's Enetron from them. Later joined by Masato Jin and his Buddyroid Beet J. Stag, the Go-Busters' resolve is strengthened once they learn the true nature of their enemy and the horrors that would result should Messiah enter their world. ==Characters== ===Go-Busters=== Actor Name Color Buddyroid Katsuhiro Suzuki Hiromu Sakurada Red Buster Cheeda Nick Ryoma Baba Ryuji Iwasaki Blue Buster Gorisaki Banana Arisa Komiya Yoko Usami Yellow Buster Usada Lettuce Hiroya Matsumoto Masato Jin Beet Buster Beet J.
