 "text": "On January 15, 2013, it was announced that horse meat was found in several meat products in England and Ireland. The horse meat was discovered through DNA testing. In most cases, horse meat was used only as a filler, but in the United Kingdom, items labeled as beef were found to have as much as 100% horse meat. Later it was discovered that horse meat was being sold as beef all over Europe, and nearly every meat seller in Europe was affected. So far, no horse meat labeled as beef has been found outside Europe. ==References== Horse meat scandal Category:Horses Category:Meat Category:2010s in the Republic of Ireland Category:Scandals",
