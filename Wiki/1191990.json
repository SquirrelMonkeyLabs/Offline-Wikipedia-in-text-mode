The school library opened in 1924. The school board made a deal with Hennepin County Library to use the school library space. In the 1950s, the school library was too small for the books. The Hennepin County Bookmobile served Eden Prarie until 1972. The first building opened in 1972 with 12,000 items. In 1986 a new building was made on Prairie Center Drive. This new location became the Eden Prairie Community Library, with 47,000 items. Eden Prairie's population grew from 16,000 in 1980 to 54,000 in 2000. The building started construction in July 2002. Many problems interrupted the construction including water damage and the original builders going bankrupt. The new Eden Prairie Library opened its doors to the public on August 12, 2004. == Poem == The following poem is included as decoration of the library: :: To Make a Prairie :: by Emily Dickinson ::: To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, ::: One clover, and a bee. ::: And revery. ::: The revery alone will do, ::: If bees are few. == References == Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas Category:Libraries in Hennepin County Library Category:1924 establishments in the United States Category:Minnesota Category:Education in the United States",
