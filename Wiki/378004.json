 "text": "Sidney Sussex College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It is often just called Sidney by the students. It was created in 1596. It takes its name from Frances Sidney, Countess of Sussex, who gave money to build it. Today it has about 550 students. It is quite a small college, and it is found in the town centre of Cambridge. Because it is in quite a small area, it has changed little since it was first built. The buildings were made of red brick at the beginning, but then they were covered by cement. Many important people have studied here: *Oliver Cromwell, a military and political leader in Great Britain *Cecil Frank Powell, who won the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physics *Charles Thomson Rees Wilson, who won the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics *John E. Walker, who won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry *Alan MacDiarmid, who won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry *Carol Vorderman, a television presenter == Other websites == *Official website Category:Colleges of the University of Cambridge Category:1596 establishments Category:1590s establishments in England",
