 "text": "Enrique García (20 November 1912 – 23 August 1969) was an Argentine footballer. García is regarded as one of Racing's greatest idols, even though he has won two titles at the club. He is even considered one of the greatest left wingers in Argentine football. He joined the Avellaneda team in 1936, for about 39,1 pesos, after emerging at Rosario Central. At Racing, he would play until 1944, scoring 78 times in 233 matches. His skill would inspire several nicknames: \"Left-Handed Poet\", \"The Magician\", \"The Unstoppable\", \"Sarmiento of Football\", but he was better known as El Chueco - \"The Crooked\", due to the way he walked and El Poeta de la Zurda (\"the poet of the left leg\", due to his skills for football). Due to his extraordinary dribbling ability, García became an idol of Racing Club, being acclaimed even by his rivals.Enrique ‘Chueco’ García, el legendario poeta de la zurda on AFA, 21 Aug 2019 He also had a successful run on the Argentina national team, winning the Copa América on two occasions in 1937 and 1941 and became runner-up in 1942. Out of García's 78 goals scored in his career, only two were scored with his right leg. ==Club career== Born in Santa Fe, García started playing football for the local club Las Rosas. At the same time, he was an altar boy in the local church, and the local priest expected García to become a priest. In 1929 he joined Brown Santa Fe, from where he was sold to Gimnasia y Esgrima Santa Fe in 1931, although he would have preferred to be with Unión Santa Fe. In 1933, García became a player of the club Rosario Central, where, according to his contemporaries, he co-created the best provincial attack in the world: Cegnotti-Gómez-Guzmán-Porto-García. In 1936, he moved to the Racing Club de Avellaneda for a record fee of 38,931 pesos. In 1937, he won his first Argentine championship title with Racing.
