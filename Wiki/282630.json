 "text": "right| thumb | Leptospira spirochaetes under scanning electron microscope Spirochaetes (or Spirochetes) are the phylum Spirochaetae. These are double-membrane bacteria with long, helically coiled (spiral-shaped) cells. Spirochaetes are bacteria. They have flagella, which run lengthwise between the cell wall and outer membrane. The flagella cause a twisting motion which moves the spirochaete about. Most spirochaetes are free-living and anaerobic, but there are many parasitic species. == Classification == The spirochaetes are divided into three families (Brachyspiraceae, Leptospiraceae, and Spirochaetaceae). They are all put in a single order, the Spirochaetales. Disease-causing members of this phylum include: * Leptospira species, some of which which cause leptospirosis * Borrelia species, some of which cause Lyme disease ** Borrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever. * Treponema pallidum subspecies which cause syphilis and yaws. * Brachyspira species, which cause intestinal spirochaetosis. == References == == Other websites == * Introduction to the Spirochetes.
