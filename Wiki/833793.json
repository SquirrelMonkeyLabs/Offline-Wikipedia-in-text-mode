 "text": "Panthoibi Iratpa or Panthoibi Eratpa is a sacred festival dedicated to Panthoipi, the goddess of war, love and fertility in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism). It is celebrated from the yearly datings according to the Meitei calendar. The timing usually coincides that of Durga Puja, the festival dedicated to Durga, the Hindu equivalent of Panthoibi. So, in Manipur, the two festivals are usually celebrated together by the Manipuri ethnicity. The Hiyangthang Lairembi Temple is one of the major sites for the festival in Northeast India.http://www.uniindia.com/durga-puja-panthoibi- festival-celebrated-in-manipur/other/news/243592.html ==References== Category:Meitei religion Category:Meitei festivals",
