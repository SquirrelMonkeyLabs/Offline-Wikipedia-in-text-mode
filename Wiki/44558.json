It is also very similar to a tuba, but the euphonium is much smaller. The euphonium makes low sounds, similar to the trombone. The euphonium has 3 or 4 valves and 1-3 spit valves. \"Spit\" valves do not really mean there is spit in the instrument, it means that there is condensation in the instrument. The euphonium is seen in different sorts of bands in Europe and America. The musicians make the sound by blowing into the instrument and \"buzzing\" with their lips. The word euphonium means: \"producing nice sounds\" Euphoniums are basically silver and brass in colour. There are many types of euphoniums, Marching euphoniums are used by marching bands.
