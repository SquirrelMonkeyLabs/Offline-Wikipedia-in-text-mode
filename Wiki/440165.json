 "text": "Ich bin ein Berliner (English: I am a Berliner) was a speech by John F. Kennedy. He made the speech on June 26, 1963 in West Berlin. This is thought to be one of Kennedy's most famous speeches. He made the speech to gain support for the Cold War and to mark the anniversary of the Berlin Wall's construction. Kennedy said: Kennedy wrote on his paper \"ish bin ein Bearleener\" to help him say it better. == Background == Germany's capital, Berlin, was deep inside the area controlled by the Soviet Union after World War II. A first governed in four sectors controlled by the four Allied powers (United States, United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union), tensions of the Cold War rose. This continued until the Soviet forces created the Berlin Blockade of the city's western sectors. The Western allies went around this with the dramatic airlift. Afterwards, the sectors controlled by the NATO Allies became an effective exclave (territory surrounded by territory of a different state or entity) of West Germany. Which was completely surrounded by East Germany. Starting in 1952, the border between East and West was closed everywhere but in Berlin. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans defected (gives up allegiance to a state) to the West via West Berlin. This was a labor drain that threatened East Germany with economic collapse. ==Related pages== * Tear down this wall!
