 "text": "Vector calculus is a branch of mathematics that investigates vector fields and how they change over time. Vector calculus usually studies two- or three- dimensional vector fields, but can be used in higher dimensions, too. It is a part of the study of multivariable calculus. Vector calculus is useful in physics and engineering because of how it can look at electromagnetic and gravitational fields. == Related pages == *Curl *Divergence *Gradient Category:Linear algebra Category:Vectors",
