On March 9, 2009 in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. On March 10, 2009 in Canada, Mexico and the United States. And on March 13, 2009 in Italy, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. It was her second album to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200. That made it Clarkson's second non-consecutive number- one album. All I Ever Wanted went Gold in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The album was originally going to be called Masquerade, but the title was changed to All I Ever Wanted. That was because because Clarkson felt that there were already albums with similar themes then on the charts, such as P!nk's Funhouse and Britney Spears' Circus. All I Ever Wanted sold 828,000 copies in the U.S. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards. ==Track listing== *In fact, Clarkson was involved in writing \"My Life Would Suck Without You\", however, she decided to remain unspecified in the song's credits because she didn't want to be associated with producer Dr. Luke. == References == Category:2009 albums Category:Kelly Clarkson albums",
