Paul Brenner has written, \"Many of Griffith's features suffer from sententious moralizing, a sense of God speaking to the masses, and outright racism. But Way Down East highlights the greatness of Griffith without having to sit through the Sermon on the Mount or the Ride of The Klan. In Way Down East, Griffith's psychotic nuttiness, for once, didn't get in the way of a good [movie].\"Brenner, Paul . FilmCritic, film review, 2007. Critic Dennis Schwartz likes \"the strong emotional performances of the diminutive Lillian Gish\". He decides that \"this old-fashioned bucolic soap opera doesn't translate well to modern-times. It's quintessential Griffith melodrama, a mix of opposing forces between those favoring Bible morality and the wealthy hedonists who mock God with their amorality ... [the movie] has an irritating moralistic Bible flavor in supporting monogamy ... The [movie]'s most exciting scene was made without any special effects, and is the only thing about the [movie] worth remembering.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * * * Way Down East at SilentEra.com * Way Down East at The Greatest Films by Tim Dirks * Way Down East at YouTube Category:1920 movies Category:Women's movies Category:American silent movies Category:Movies based on plays Category:Movies directed by D.
