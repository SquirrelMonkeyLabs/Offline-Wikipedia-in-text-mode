 "text": "Yahoo! Search is an Internet search engine. It is owned by Yahoo! Inc. In December 2009, it was the 2nd most used search engine- 6.42% of internet searches were done on Yahoo! Search. Google was the most used with 85.35% and Baidu was 3rd with 3.67%, according to Net Applications. Yahoo! Search started as a web directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy. Then, in the late 1990s, Yahoo! changed into a portal with a search interface and, by 2007, a limited version of selection-based search. Yahoo! Search used to be called \"Yahoo! provided Search interface\". It would send queries to a searchable index of pages and its directory of sites. The results were shown on the screen under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web searching and storage/retrieval of data was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001 the searchable index was run by Inktomi and later was run by Google until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that Bing would run Yahoo! Search.Microsoft and Yahoo seal web deal. All Yahoo! Search customers and partners were moved to Bing by early 2012.\"When will the change happen?
