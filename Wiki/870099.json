 "text": "Surah Al-Maidah (Arabic: سورة المائدة) is the 5th surah of the Muslim religious book, the Qur'an , which has 120 verses and 18 ruku's. The Surah was revealed in Medina. == Name == It is named after the word 'Maidah' mentioned in a verse of 15 Ruku of this Surah. The word mayidah means 'dining table' or 'a table in which food is served'. Like most of the surahs in the Qur'an, the name of this surah has nothing to do with its subject matter. It has been called by this name merely to distinguish it from other Surahs. == Time of revelation == This Surah was revealed at the end of 6 AH or at the beginning of 6 AH after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah . This is clear from the subject matter of the Surah and the various narrations of the Hadith also prove its authenticity. The event of the month of Zilqad in the sixth Hijri. Fourteen, with Muslims the Prophet Muhammad Umrah to perform there has arisen. But the Quraish disbelievers, out of enmity, completely opposed the oldest religious tradition in Arabia and did not allow him to perform Umrah . After much debate and debate, they agreed that next year you can come to visit the house of God. At this time, on the one hand, the Muslims had a KaabaIt was necessary to explain the rules of pilgrimage for the purpose of pilgrimage, so that the Umrah could be performed with full Islamic dignity next year, and on the other hand, it was necessary to urge them to respond to the excesses of the infidel enemies by not allowing them to perform Umrah. Let them take the lead, so that they may not again oppress the disbelievers. Because Hajj to many disbelieving tribesThe tour had to go through Muslim-dominated areas. In the same way that the Muslims were not allowed to visit the Ka'bah, they could have forcibly blocked the way of visiting the Ka'bah of these disbelieving tribes. This is the context in which the introductory speech at the beginning of this Surah is discussed. This issue has been raised again in the front thirteen ruku's. This proves that the same speech continues from the first ruku to the fourteenth ruku. In addition, all the other contents we find in this Surah seem to be of the same period. The continuity of the narration suggests that this entire surah is included in a single discourse and that it was probably revealed at the same time. Again, some of its verses may have been revealed later separately and due to the unity of content, they have been included in different places of this Surah. But nowhere in the continuity of narration is the slightest emptiness felt. As a result, there is no time to think of it as the sum of two or three speeches. == Reference == == Other websites == * * Quran 5 Clear Quran translation * Q5:51, 50+ translations, islamawakened.com Category:Chapters in the Quran",
