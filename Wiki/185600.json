 "text": "The Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) is a small Old World vulture. It is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to southern Asia. It is the only living member of the genus Neophron, and there are three subspecies. In Southern Asia this species is called the scavenger vulture. When they feed on the eggs of other birds, they break larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds, but Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. == References == Category:Accipitriformes Category:Birds of Africa Category:Birds of Europe Category:Birds of Asia Category:Vultures",
