In exile, Charles de Gaulle (a french general) proclaimed Free France, an allied government-in-exile part of the allied powers against Germany with de Gaulle as chairman of national committee. Italy then invaded British Somaliland, and succeeded. then italy invaded Egypt (starting the North African Campaign), and it did not succeed. After this, Italy attempted to invade Greece, but it failed.

Meanwhile Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria joined the axis, Yugoslavia joined to, but a coup had overthrown the government, so Germany, Italy, and Hungary invaded Yugoslavia, and in 10-20 days, Yugoslavia and Greece surrendered. There would be resistance all over Yugoslavia and Greece in the next 4 years, the British had sent more troops from Egypt and Greece, so axis forces moved deeper into Egyptian territory, but an Australian force at Tobruk, prevented supplies from reaching the axis armyâ€™s. Iraq set up an axis government, so British and commonwealth forces invaded Iraq. (they also invaded Vichy french-controlled Syria and Lebanon) On the 22nd of June 1941, Germany invaded the USSR. The British made a supply line to the eastern front, but Iran (a country in the supply line) supported the axis, so Anglo-Soviet forces invaded Iran. On the 7th of December 1941, Japan bombed pearl harbour, which would bring the United States in to the war. === 1942 - 1943 === In Egypt, the axis forces were pushed back, then the allied forces were pushed back, then after a battle at El Alamein, allied forces and new American forces landing in Algeria pushed the axis forces out of africa, and Vichy France was invaded by the axis powers.
