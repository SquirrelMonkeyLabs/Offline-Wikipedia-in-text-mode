 "text": "U.S. Games Corporation was an American company that made video games. Until 1981, it created handheld electronic sports games. It was bought by cereal company Quaker Oats in 1982 to compete with Parker Brothers (which was then owned by rival company General Mills) in the video game market and use the Fisher-Price brand name. U.S. Games released 14 video games, of which their first was Space Jockey in January 1982. They named themselves Vidtec for some of their earlier games. Like Parker Brothers, U.S. Games aimed to make quality, licensed games for families; Parker Brothers had released many popular games in 1982, including Frogger and The Empire Strikes Back. However, U.S. Games did not sell many copies of their games, and was closed during the video game crash of 1983, before it could use its recently acquired Pink Panther license. \"None of our games became a hit,\" said spokesman Ronald Bottrell. \"Instead of pouring in a lot more capital, we decided to drop it\".Video Games Go Crunch! - TIME magazine, Oct. 17, 1983 issue U.S. Games is known for being an attempt by a non-technology company to produce video games. ==Released games== In order of product number: *Space Jockey *Sneak 'n Peek *Word Zapper *Commando Raid *Name This Game *Towering Inferno *M.A.D. *Gopher *Squeeze Box *Eggomania *Picnic *Piece o' Cake *Raft Rider *Entombed ==References== Category:Video game companies Category:Video game companies of the United States Category:Defunct companies Category:1982 establishments in the United States Category:Atari 2600",
