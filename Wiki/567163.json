The watershed across the plateau divides the drainage basin in two: the Atlantic to the north and the Mediterranean to the south. On its southern slopes is the source of the Hérault river, that flows to the south into the Mediterranean Sea. The mountain is formed by granite from the Palaeozoic era. On top of the mountain there is a meteorological station built in 1887. It is the last remaining weather station in France which is still inhabited by meteorologists. An exhibition on weather forecasting is open to visitors in the summer months.
