Their capital Tbilisi, formerly named Tiflis, was founded in the 5th century, by King Vakhtang I of Iberia. Back then, western Georgia was colonized by the Roman Empire. * * * * * The Arabs conquered it in 635 AD. Despite centuries of Islamization, the Georgian culture flourished via trade. In the 10th century, Arab influence diminished in the Caucasus. In 1008, the Kingdom of Georgia was formed. It was a major country in the region until the Mongol Empire invaded it in 1223. Georgia was part of the Mongol Empire for a century on and off until 1334, when King Giorgi V took over. ===Early modern period=== In the 1400s, Georgia dissolved into several principalities. In the 1500s, the Persians invaded eastern Georgia four times from 1541 to 1544. In 1555, the Kings of Kartli ruled through the will of the Persian Shahs (kings of a Persian empire). * * * * * ===Modern period=== In 1783, the treaty of Georgievsk was signed between Catherine the Great of Russia and King Heraclius II, giving Russia the power to protect Georgia. Then, in 1798 the Persians burned Tbilisi to the ground. From 1811 to 1918, Georgia was under the Tsar of Russia. Their culture survived intact. From 1918 to 1921, Georgia was independent, but then conquered by the Soviet Union (USSR) and colonized, briefly interrupted by Nazi occupation in WWII, until the end of the USSR in December 1991. ===Post- Soviet period: 1990s=== In 1991, most Georgians voted to restore their sovereignty as a free nation. They then declared their independence. However, the re-established Republic of Georgia saw a bloody civil War that led to the downfall of first-ever president of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Georgia was also involved in War in Abkhazia between 1992 and 1993. They went through a rough patch between 1994 and 1995 when the economy underperformed, despite significant improvements in final years of the 20th century. ===Post-Soviet period: 21st century=== Since the 2000s, Georgia has been applying for EU and NATO membership. In 2008, Georgia was illegally invaded by Russia and lost 20% of her territory, with Abkhazia and South Ossetia having fallen under Russian occupation ever since. * * * * * ====2024 – present==== Since 26 October 2024, the ruling party Georgian Dream (GD), beset with allegations of corruption and pro-Russian authoritarianism, * * * * * has been accused of rigging the Georgian parliamentary election run on that day. The crisis came to a head when the GD government announced the postponement of EU membership talks until 2028, setting off an intense wave of pro-democracy protests * * * * * * * * * * unseen since the 2003 Rose Revolution.* * * * * * Of Georgia's 3.76 million population in 2024, over 100,000 have participated in at least eight Georgian cities. * * * * * * * * * * ==Geography== Georgia is located next to the countries of Russia, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
