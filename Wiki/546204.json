From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly gave all the territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. === 19th century === In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. But, it kept about 7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land including the modern- day state of Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of Louisiana Purchase. In 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act created the territory of Kansas. In 1855, Douglas County was established. Douglas County was opened for settlement on May 15, 1854. It was named for Stephen A. Douglas. The county was practically at the center of the Bleeding Kansas years as leaders in Lecompton, the territorial capital, wanted Kansas to be a slave state. Leaders in Lawrence wanted Kansas to be a free state. A number of events took place in Douglas County. These including the drafting of the controversial Lecompton Constitution (trying to admit Kansas as a slave state), the sacking of Lawrence, and the Battle of Black Jack. The first railroad in Douglas County, the Union Pacific, was built through that territory in 1864. == Geography == The U.S. Census Bureau says that the county has a total area of . Of this, is land and (4.0%) is water. It is the fifth-smallest county in Kansas by land area. Much of its northern border is defined by the Kansas River, which goes through Lawrence.

This can be seen from its voting history. It has the exact same voting history as that of Vermont or Cheshire County, New Hampshire (except the 1912 presidential election). This is due to the county's strong New England heritage. Douglas County voted for the Republican candidate in every Presidential election between 1864 and 1960, except in 1912 when it voted for Progressive Theodore Roosevelt. The Republican presidential nominee got over sixty percent of Douglas County's vote in every election between 1920 and 1960 (except 1932 when Herbert Hoover received 58.7 percent). To show how deeply the county's Republican roots ran, even when Kansas voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936, Republican candidates won the county easily. This changed in 1964, with the anti-Yankee feeling and Southern leanings of Barry Goldwater. This led to Douglas County voting for Lyndon B. Johnson, making Johnson the first Democrat ever to win the county. With more moderate GOP candidates, the GOP carried the county in every election between 1968 and 1988. However, the growing transformation of Lawrence into a liberal academic town pulled the county into the Democratic column from 1992 onwards. This was similar to many counties around the United States with college towns. Since the 2004 election, Douglas County has been one of the strongest Democratic places in Kansas, second only to Wyandotte County. Often, Douglas and Wyandotte are the only two counties in the state to vote for Democratic presidential candidates. == Education == === Unified school districts === Douglas County is served by seven school districts. * Lawrence USD 497 serves Lawrence and the Clinton Lake area. * Baldwin City USD 348 serves Baldwin City and most of southern Douglas County. * Perry-Lecompton USD 343 serves Lecompton and most of northwest Douglas County. * Eudora USD 491 serves Eudora and the northeast part of the county. * Santa Fe Trail USD 434 covers the southwest part of the county. * Wellsville USD 289 covers extreme southeast Douglas County. * services the far western part of the county including Big Springs. === Universities and colleges === The University of Kansas's main campus is in Lawrence.
