 "text": "Rheobates pseudopalmatus is a frog. Scientists found it in Colombia. ==Home== These frogs live in streams that have trees growing around them. Scientists saw it between 800 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog in protected places, for example the Jaguas hydroelectric area and San Carlos hydroelectric area. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives. People cut down trees to make farms and places for cows to eat grass, make dams for electricity, and coffee farms. Pollution can also hurt this frog. Droughts can also hurt this frog. Plants from other parts of the world can grow in the streams so that the frogs cannot live there. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
