 "text": "The São Paulo tree toad (Hylodes magalhaesi) is a frog. It lives in São Paulo and Minas Gerais in Brazil. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is about 29.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 33 mm long. Their eardrums are bigger than their eyes. The skin of the frog's back is dark with white marks. ==Young== The tadpoles of this frog swim in streams. People can find them swimming all year. ==Dangers== There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists do not know why for sure. They think it could be that human beings change the places where the frog lives. Humans cut down trees to get wood to build with and to make farms and build cities. There are also other frogs from other parts of the world that eat the same food as this frog. This frog can be killed by disease: Scientists found the chytridiomycosis fungus growing on some frogs. This fungus can kill frogs. ==Name== Scientists named this frog after Dr. José Carlos Reis de Magalhães, who helped study it. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
