 "text": "Rate Field is a baseball park in Chicago, Illinois. It is the home field of the Major League Baseball team called the Chicago White Sox. It opened in 1991, replacing historic Comiskey Park. Before U.S. Cellular, a wireless telephone carrier, bought naming rights in 2003, with the stadium then being renamed U.S. Cellular Field, the ballpark was known as New Comiskey Park (or just \"Comiskey Park\"), in honor of the old park. The stadium name lost most of its value in Chicago after the company sold its local network to Sprint in 2012. During the 2016 MLB season, the White Sox made a new deal with Chicago- based mortgage lender Guaranteed Rate. The stadium name officially changed on November 1 of that year. In late 2024, Guaranteed Rate changed its name to Rate, and the ballpark name was changed that December 18. == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
