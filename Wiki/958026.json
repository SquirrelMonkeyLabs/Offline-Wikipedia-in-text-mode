 "text": "The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, 1949 was a law that was passed in South Africa in 1949. It was one of the first laws passed during an era known as Apartheid. It made it illegal for \"white people\" to marry \"non-white people\". One year later, another law required all people living in South Africa to register as one of four racial groups. The other groups were Black, Coloured and Asian. The law did not criminalize sexual relationships between people of the other groups. The law was changed in 1968 and abolished in 1985. According to a study by the South African Statistical Office, there were 1393 mixed-race marriages in 1987; this accounts for 2.1 percent of all marriages of that year.
