It happened at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, on June 3, 2017. In this final, Juventus from Italy faced Real Madrid from Spain, who were the current champions. Real Madrid won 4–1 and secured their 12th title. They became the first team to defend their title since Milan in 1990. Juventus, on the other hand, lost their fifth Champions League final in a row and their seventh overall out of nine finals they've reached. As a result of winning the Champions League, Real Madrid earned a spot in the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. They also had the opportunity to play against the winners of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, and they won both of these competitions as well. ==How they got here== Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).
