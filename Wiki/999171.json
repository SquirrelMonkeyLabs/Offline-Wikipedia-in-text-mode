 "text": "The pungi originates from the Indian subcontinent. The instrument consists of a reservoir into which air is blown and then channelled into two reed pipes. It is played with no pauses, as the player must utilize circular breathing. In street performances, the pungi is used for snake charming. The pungi is also sometimes called “been.” It is made from a gourd, with additional elements made from wax, bamboo, metal, beeswax, and coconuts. Common pungis are one to two feet in length.
