It is Nintendo's first handheld with switchable games. The Game Boy is also one of the first portable consoles to use game cartridges, meaning the games are interchangeable. The Game Boy family eventually expanded to include the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Game Boy Micro. The Game Boy was discontinued on 23 March 2003. The Game Boy has a green screen that displays four shades of dark green (gray for the Game Boy Pocket). Like the NES, the Game Boy has two face buttons, start and select, and a cross-shaped direction pad. The console has a single speaker, and it can be used with stereo headphones. As many as four Game Boys can be connected together with the Game Boy Link Cable. The Game Boy was invented by Gunpei Yokoi, who was also responsible for creating the unsuccessful Virtual Boy and the successful Game & Watch games. Recently, the Game Boy was compared to all Nintendo handhelds and systems released between 1989 and 2016 to see how long each one's battery life lasted, and the Game Boy beat all the other systems with 30 hours of battery life. The Game Boy provided the most game play at its time and currently still does. ==Best- selling games== * Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow * Tetris (included with the Game Boy) * Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal * Super Mario Land * Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins * Dr. Mario * Pokémon Pinball * Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 * Kirby's Dream Land * Super Mario Bros.
