 "text": "The Virtue of Selfishness is a book mostly by Ayn Rand. It was published in 1964. In it, Rand says that altruism is bad because it's about treating other people as more important than yourself. She says that if you help others because you think that can help you that's selfish and if you help them because like how you feel when you help people, that's selfish. She says selfishness is a good thing called a virtue. Rand says that if you're smart then you know that you'll sometimes need other people to help you and because of that youâ€™ll help others. She calls this \"rational self-interest\" and says that it's a good thing. Category:1964 books Category:Libertarianism",
