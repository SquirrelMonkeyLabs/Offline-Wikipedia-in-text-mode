He is only the second player who was born in Germany to play in the Finals. He is a 12-time NBA All Star. Nowitkzi won the 2006-07 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. The Mavericks, led by Nowitzki, defeated the Miami Heat 4-2 in the 2011 NBA Finals. In addition to performing very well in general in the Finals, his 101-degree fever in Game 4 didn't stop him from scoring the winning basket to tie the series 2-2. This amazing feat is a lot like when Michael Jordan played well despite the flu in the 1997 Finals against the Utah Jazz. Dirk's jersey number is 41. ==Other websites== * *The Dirk Nowitzki Foundation *Dirk Nowitzki at fiba.com Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Dallas Mavericks players Category:German basketball players Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Category:National Basketball Association players with retired numbers Category:People from Würzburg Category:Power forwards Category:Sportspeople from Bavaria",
