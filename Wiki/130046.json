 "text": "Upton Park, or the Boleyn Ground, was previously the home stadium of West Ham United in the East End of London. The club started playing here in 1904. Recently they moved to the Olympic Stadium because the Boleyn Ground was to be made into flats. Many West Ham fans were devastated but many debate that the Olympic Stadium is better. ==History== On the 10th May 2016, the final game was played between West Ham United F.C. and Manchester United F.C. because the ground was sold for demolition. The game finished with West Ham winning 3-2. By July 2016, the seats were removed and it was handed over to the developers for demolition.
