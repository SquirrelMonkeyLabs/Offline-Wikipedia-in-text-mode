 "text": "The Charlotte Knights are a Minor League Baseball team from Charlotte, North Carolina. They play baseball at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the International League (a group of 20 baseball teams at the same level). The Knights are partnered with the Chicago White Sox, a Major League Baseball team. When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he may be moved up to play for the White Sox. The Knights started playing baseball in 1976 as the Charlotte Orioles. They changed their name to Knights in 1988. They have played at a stadium called Truist Field since 2014. Before that, they played at Knights Stadium from 1990 to 2013, Knights Castle in 1989, and Knights Park from 1976 to 1988. ==References== ==Other websites== * The team's website * The team's statistics from Baseball-Reference Category:1970s establishments in the United States Category:Baseball teams in the United States Category:Chicago White Sox Category:Sports in Charlotte, North Carolina",
