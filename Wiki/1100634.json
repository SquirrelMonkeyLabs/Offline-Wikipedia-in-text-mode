 "text": "Chairil Anwar (26 July 1922 â€“ 28 April 1949) was an Indonesian poet. He is the author of more than 70 poems. Some of his poems were full of excitement but some showed that the poet was scared of dying and very sad. This combination led at least one scholar to say Anwar was the \"perfect poet\". Chairil is one of the most famous authors in Indonesian history. His poetry encouraged many Indonesian people to believe in themselves and fight for independence. However, he didn't just write. He also took part in the fighting. According to the historian Boen S. Obmarjati, \"It is known that Chairil Anwar took an active part in the Indonesian struggle for Independence. He was fighting on the side of the national movement of 1945.\" Sadly, Chairil died at a very young age from an unknown disease. == References == Category:Indonesian poets Category:1922 births Category:1949 deaths",
