 "text": "Lake Itasca is a glacial lake found in north Minnesota. It is the primary source for the Mississippi River. Although the river has tributaries which contribute a large volume of water to it, none are as dramatic as the lake's. Many science experiments are carried out here because of the lake's surrounding ecology and geography. Category:Geography of Minnesota Category:Lakes of the United States",
