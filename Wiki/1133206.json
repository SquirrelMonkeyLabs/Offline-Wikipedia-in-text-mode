 "text": "Deep-sea fish are fish that live in very deep waters of oceans. Examples of deep-sea fish are anglerfish, lanternfish, cookiecutter sharks, and others. They can live 3,500 m deep or more. == Adaptations == People once thought the deepest depths of the sea were inhospitable to fish. However, scientists have discovered many deep-sea fish, including the Mariana snailfish. Sharks are also able to reside in these deep areas. Examples include the goblin and megamouth sharks. == Examples == === Anglerfish === Anglerfish, order Lophiiformes, have a special lure on their heads. Smaller fish get attracted by the light, only to get noshed by the anglerfish. === Lanternfish === Lanternfish, family Myctophidae, have bioluminescent spots, giving them their name. === Flashlight fish === Flashlight fish, family Anomalopidae, have bioluminescent organs that have glowing bacteria. == Gallery == == Related pages == * Telescopefish * Anglerfish == References == # Marshall (1984). \"Progenetic tendencies in deep-sea fishes\", pp. 91-101 in Potts GW and Wootton RJ (eds.)
