 "text": "Quarxs was one of the first computer animated series, predating ReBoot, and the first one produced in HD. It was created by Maurice Benayoun and Belgian comic-book artist François Schuiten. It was shown between 1990 and 1993. Each episode is three minutes long. 100 were planned, but only 12 were made. A cryptobiology researcher, who discovered Quarxs, describes them as mysterious, omnipresent and invisible creatures that bend the laws of physics, biology and optics, and the only reason the world is not perfect. Quarxs is the only fictional series by Maurice Benayoun, a contemporary artist who later moved to media art. It has received many awards from international events and festivals, such as SIGGRAPH, Imagina, Ars Electronica, ISEA, Images du Futur, Sitges, Tampere, and the International Monitor Award. The series has been shown in more than 15 countries. ==Creatures== * Amperophile – Attracted to electrical currents * Carno-lampire – Mentioned, but not described * Elasto- fragmentoplast – Breaks small objects * Electricia – Causes electrical incidents * Mille-folio – Lays between the animate and the inanimate * Mnemochrome – Copies artworks * Paleoquarxs – A range of primitive Quarxs * Partio scopa dextra – Visible only from the right side * Polymorpho proximens – Takes the shape of nearby objects * Reverso chrono-cycli – Reverses the flow of time * Spatio-striata – Only present in some slices of space * Spiro- thermophage – Absorbs the heat in plumbing systems * Voltophage – Eats electrical current ==Awards== Quarxs has received many awards: * Finalist, International Monitor Awards, Los Angeles, USA, October 1995. * Official selection, Film West, Sydney, Australia, August 1995. * Prize of the Best European Animation Film, Prix Jose Abel, Cinanima, Espinho, Portugal, October 1994. * Silver Trophy, \"Espace Creation\", F.A.U.S.T., Toulouse, France, November 1994. * Official selection, Antenna Cinema, Festival of TV series, Treviso, Italy, September 1994. * Official selection, Electronic Theater, 5 Th.
