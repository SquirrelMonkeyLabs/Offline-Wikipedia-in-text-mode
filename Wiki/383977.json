 "text": "The Division of Wannon is an Australian Electoral Division in Victoria. It is in the south-west of the state, and includes much of the western part of Victoria. It is next to the South Australian border in the west, and the Bass Strait coast in the south. The Division includes the towns of Warnambool, Portland, Ararat, Hamilton, Stawell and Halls Gap. The Grampians and the Port Campbell National Parks are in the Division. Maryborough and Avoca will become part of Wannon at the 2013 federal election after changes that took place on December 24, 2010. The Division was one of the 75 divisions drawn up for the first federal election in 1901. It was named after the Wannon River, which had been named by Major Mitchell in 1836. ==Members== Member Party Term Samuel Cooke Free Trade 1901–1903 Arthur Robinson Free Trade 1903–1906 John McDougall Labor 1906–1913 Arthur Rodgers Commonwealth Liberal 1913–1917 Nationalist 1917–1922 John McNeill Labor 1922–1925 Arthur Rodgers Nationalist 1925–1929 John McNeill Labor 1929–1931 Thomas Scholfield United Australia 1931–1940 Donald McLeod Labor 1940–1949 Daniel Mackinnon Liberal 1949–1951 Donald McLeod Labor 1951–1955 Malcolm Fraser Liberal 1955–1983 David Hawker Liberal 1983–2010 Dan Tehan Liberal 2010–present For the first 50 years the division was held by both the Australian Labor Party and the conservative parties. However, changes in 1955 removed most of the seat's Labor-friendly territory, and it has been a safe Liberal seat since then. The seat was held by former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. ==Election results== ==References== *Division of Wannon - Australian Electoral Commission ==Other websites== * Dan Tehan's website Category:Electoral divisions of Victoria, Australia Category:1901 establishments in Australia",
