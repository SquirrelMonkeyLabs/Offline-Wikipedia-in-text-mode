 "text": "The royal marriage alliances between the Meitei royal family, Ningthouja dynasty () of Manipur kingdom and the Manikya dynasty of Tripura kingdom brought good relationship between the two states as well as assimilation of the two cultures. The Tripuri kings married not only the Meitei princesses but also many other ladies of commoners' families of Meitei community (alias Manipuri ethnicity). Meitei queens were remembered for their contributions to the development of the Tripuri society. So, they were given high status in the royal house of Tripura. == Early queens == === Unnamed queen === The first historically recorded matrimonial alliances between the Meitei kingdom and Tripura kingdom is mentioned in the Tripuri royal chronicle of \"Sri Rajmala\". According to the book, Tripuri King Taidakshin, who was the grandson of King Trilochana, married a Meitei princess in 5th century CE. However, names of the princess as well as of her father was not mentioned. === Queen Yangnu === Cheitharol Kumbaba (), the Meitei royal chronicle of Manipur kingdom, mentioned that in 1609, a lady named Yangnu () of the Akhoicham family (), who was the wife of a Tripuri King went to her country.

King Bhagyachandra went for pilgrimages to many holy and sacred places of India. On his way, he visited and stayed in Agartala, the Tripuri capital, for few days. During his stay, he offered his daughter, princess Hariseswari, hand in marriage to Tripuri King Rajdhar Manikya II. This marriage brought cordial relations between the two kingdoms. The Meitei king then left Tripura for his further pilgrimage. Meitei Queen Hariseswari brought an idol of Hindu deity, Sri Radhamadhav, from her homeland Manipur. It was installed in the royal palace of Tripura. Meitei priests, musicians, noblemen and maid attendants of the Meitei princess came from Manipur and settled in Tripura.
