 "text": "The companions or assistants of the Doctor of the Doctor Who television series are people who travel with him. The Doctor is an alien. He is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. He travels in his spaceship called the TARDIS. It allows him to go anywhere in time and space. \"TARDIS\" stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space. The Doctor usually takes other people with him, who are usually called \"companions\" or \"assistants\". The Doctor and his companions travel through space and time, have a lot of adventures, and often save many people. The character of the companion was there so that the people watching the series could identify and feel close to a character. The companions were often present-time humans. People could relate to them because they knew as much as the viewers. Because of this, the Doctor could explain things to his companions, and at the same time to the viewers. Most of the Doctor's companions have been human. Many have been aliens or robots. Companions are named under the Doctors they travelled with, and sorted by the order in which they appear. == First Doctor == === Susan === Susan (Carole Ann Ford) was the Doctor's granddaughter.
