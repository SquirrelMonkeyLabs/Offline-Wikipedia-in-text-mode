On 22 March 2013, West Ham United secured a 99-year lease on the Olympic Stadium, with it planned to be used as the football club's home ground from the 2016-17 season. In September 2015, the British Government rejected holding an inquiry into the arrangement that was pressed for by rival clubs who argued West Ham United were being given an unfair advantage. On 8 May 2018, Major League Baseball announced a two-year deal to host a series of baseball games at the London Stadium in 2019 and 2020. The Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees (a major rivalry in the American League) played a two-game series at the stadium from 29 to 30 June 2019, branded as the 2019 MLB London Series. The London Stadium has occasionally held concerts since the end of the Olympics in 2012. == References == Category:2012 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Major League Baseball venues Category:2010s establishments in England Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Newham",
