 "text": "A letter is a physical, written message that one person sends to another person (or group of people), often by mail. Ancient rulers of nations were probably the first people to send and receive letters. The practice of letter- writing eventually spread to include those who were not leaders of nations. Since the late 20th century, letter-writing has decreased because new forms of electronic communication have been created, including computers and telephones. However, many people still send letters, such as for business purposes. Since the late 20th century, scholars have begun to spend more time studying the practice of letter-writing academically. == Related pages == * Electronic mail * Envelope * Gallows letter * Letter box * Postcard * Telegram == References ==",
