 "text": "The Free Syrian University was made in 2013 for refugees from the Syrian civil war that are uneducated and are the age for college. The university is a secular university, not with any religion but does offer a degree in Islamic Studies. The university supports the Syrian opposition and bases its name off of the Free Syrian Army. The university is in the country of Turkey, in a town close to the Idlib Governorate of Syria but also holds online meetings using software like Zoom or Google Meet for those not in Turkey. To enroll in the university it costs $1500 usually but most refugees do not have the finances so they attend at a reduced fee or free. ==References== Category:2010s establishments in Turkey Category:2013 establishments in Asia Category:Colleges and universities",
