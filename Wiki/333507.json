 "text": "There are 14 counties in the U.S. state of Vermont. These counties together contain 256 political units, or places, including 237 towns, 10 cities, 5 unincorporated areas, and 4 gores. Each county has a county seat, known in Vermont as shire town. In 1779, Vermont had two counties. The western side of the state was called Bennington County and the eastern was called Cumberland County. In 1781, Cumberland County was made into three counties in Vermont plus another county named Washington (not the same as the modern Washington County) that then became part of New Hampshire. Today's Washington County was known as Jefferson County from its start in 1810 until it was renamed in 1814. Essex County, Orleans County, and Caledonia County are commonly called the Northeast Kingdom. ==List== County FIPS Code Shire Town Created Formed from Meaning of name Population (2020) Land Area Map ==Notes== * There are several sources that state the formation year for Windham County is 1781 and that Cumberland County was dissolved rather than renamed. ==References== * Vermont",
