 "text": "A taxis (plural taxes) is an innate behavioral response by an organism to a directional stimulus. This means the organism automatically moves towards or away from the stimulus. A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often plant growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and shows movement towards or away from the stimulus source.Dusenbery, David B. 2009. Living at micro scale, Ch. 14. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. *Phototaxis: movement, usually towards light. Shown by many organisms, such as many flying insects. *Chemotaxis: movement towards desirable chemicals, and away from unpleasant ones. Even single-celled organisms can show taxis. == References == Category:Physiology",
