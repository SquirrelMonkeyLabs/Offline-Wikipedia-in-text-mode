The population as of 2007 is about 996.CartesFrance.fr ==History== ===Origin of the name=== The first mention of the village is under the name Cantevanne, in a 1239 text. Later it became Kaufen. In 1801, it changed to Kanfen. The name stayed the same when Alsace-Moselle became part of the German Empire in 1870. The most likely etymology is a contraction of the Gaulish word canto (mountain) and the Germanic radical Fenn (marshland). ===History of the commune=== Kanfen and all of the Thionville region was dependent of the Duchy of Luxembourg. Le Grand Cond√© took Thionville in 1643. The village became part of the Kingdom of France. This was confirmed by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. As it was part of Alsace-Moselle, the commune was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. It was annexed by the Third Reich between 1940 and 1944. ==Geography== Kanfen is next to the Kudertsberg hill, around 230 metres high. The river Kiesel has its source in the village flows through it.
