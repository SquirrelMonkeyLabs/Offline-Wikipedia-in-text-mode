 "text": "The Phasmahyla cruzi is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Rio das Pedras Reserve in southeastern Brazil. Scientists are not sure whether it belongs in the family Phyllomedisidae or the family Hylidae, subfamily Phyllomedusinae. ==Name== The frog is named after Carlos Alberto Gon√ßalves da Cruz, a Brazilian amphibian scientist. Scientists say people should call it Mangaratiba tree frog in English. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is long from nose to rear end and the only adult female frog the scientists found was long. It has a short nose and big eyes that stick out of its head. Its ear disk is large, but a piece of skin covers part of it. There are disks on its toes for climbing. There is no webbed skin on any of its feet. The frog's skin is green in color with purple spots. The belly is light in color. The iris of its eyes is silver-gray in color. Older tadpoles can be long, with the tail. ==Home== People have found these frogs in streams with sand on the bottom. These places were always 200 meters above sea level or higher. This frog can only live in forests in which the branches come together like a roof. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
