 "text": "Solitaire is a card game for one player using a pack of playing cards. There are many types of solitaire, such as Klondike, FreeCell, Pyramid, Golf, and Spider. Most computer operating systems include simple solitaire games such as Spider Solitaire on Microsoft Windows. In Klondike, the player wins the game when the player has all the cards in four stacks organized by color (\"suit\") and number. In many countries (for example, UK), solitaire is called Patience. ==Types of games== * Patience, also known as \"solitaire with cards\", usually involves placing cards in a layout and sorting them by the game's rules. * Klondike is the most common kind of solitaire. It is bundled with the Microsoft Windows operating system under the title Solitaire. * Mahjong solitaire * Peg solitaire is a board game in which the goal is to empty the board of pegs through movement and capturing. It is more of a puzzle than a game. * Concentration, also known as Memory, Pelmanism (UK), Shinkei-suijaku (Japan), Pexeso (Czechia) or simply Pairs, is a card game in which the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.
