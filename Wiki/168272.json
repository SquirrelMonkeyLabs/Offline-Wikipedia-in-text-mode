 "text": "xkcd is a comic strip on the Internet. American cartoonist Randall Munroe draws and writes the comic. The comic is drawn in boxes. It is one of the most popular comics on the Internet. It is \"a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language\". Sometimes, the readers of the comic act out things that Munroe puts in his comics. There are also messages in all comics that show up when moused over. In October 2007, the comic was viewed about 60 million times. The comic has won many awards. The name \"xkcd\" does not mean anything and was just made so people do not say it as a word. , there are over 3000 different xkcd comics. In November 2015, Munroe wrote a book named Thing Explainer, using the same stick figure drawings from his comic. The book is about how things work, and is written in Simple English. It uses only one thousand different simple words. The idea for it came from a comic \"Up goer Five\" which is about the Saturn V rocket. == References == Notes == Other websites == * Main site * A site for explaining the comics of xkcd Category:Webcomics",
