 "text": "The Antinous Braschi is a marble sculpture representing Hadrian's lover (117-138 AD), Antinous. He is depicted with great beauty and splendour, such is his beauty that he could even be compared to a god of Olympus. == History == The sculpture was discovered in excavations of 1793-1793, which took place in the alleged Hadrian's villa in the town of Palestrina., where numerous works of great value were also found. Giovanni Pierantoni restored the statue at the request of the Braschi family, who years later exhibited the sculpture in one of their numerous properties, the Palazzo Braschi. Some time later it was decided to transport the work to the Lateran Museum, until it was finally brought to the Vatican Museums, where it still remains today. === Building date === The date of the construction of the statue is dated after the death of Antinous, who drowned in the Nile River in 130 AD, and was later deified with full honours by Emperor Hadrian. == Description == The statue is related to Dionysus or Osiris, this is due to the elements he carries. On his head he wears a diadem with fruits, formerly he wore an uraeus (cobra) or lotus flower, but because of modern restorations, these elements were replaced by a pine cone. == References == Category:Rome Category:Greek mythology Category:Vatican City",
