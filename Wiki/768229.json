 "text": "Alfred Binet (; 8 July 1857 – 18 October 1911) was a French psychologist who invented the first practical IQ test. This is called the Binet–Simon test.O.L. Zangwill, 'Binet, Alfred', in R. Gregory, The Oxford Companion to the Mind. 1987, p88. In 1905, the French Ministry of Education asked psychologist Alfred Binet to find which students did not learn effectively from regular classroom instruction. They could be given remedial work. With his collaborator Théodore Simon, Binet published revisions of his test in 1908 and 1911, the last of which appeared just before his death. In 1984, the journal Science 84 picked the Binet-Simon scale as one of twenty of the century's most significant developments or discoveries. == Reference == Category:French psychologists Category:Tests Category:1857 births Category:1911 deaths Category:French sociologists Category:People from Nice Category:Statisticians",
