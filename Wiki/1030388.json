The Northern Territory Electoral Commission (NTEC) held the election. Chief Minister Adam Giles led the incumbent Country Liberal government. The Country Liberal Party (CLP) tried to win a second term. However, they were defeated by the Labor Party in a landslide. They were led by Opposition Leader Michael Gunner. It was a wipeout loss for the CLP, who lost ten seats. They only had two seats after the election. Giles became the second Chief Minister in Northern Territory history to lose their seat at an election. It was the first time that Labor won seats in the cities of Alice Springs and Katherine. These cities normally vote for the CLP. ==References== Category:2016 elections Category:Elections in the Northern Territory Category:2010s in the Northern Territory",
