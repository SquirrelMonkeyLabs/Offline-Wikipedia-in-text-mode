The fight took place at Dehradun, near the Nalapani fort, which was besieged by the British between October 31 and November 30, 1814. Captain Balbhadra Kunwar commanded the fort's defenders, while Major-General Robert Rollo Gillespie, who had previously participated in the Battle of Java, led the invading British forces. Gillespie was slain while rousing his soldiers on the first day of the siege. ==References== Category:History of Nepal Category:19th century in India Category:Wars involving India Category:1810s Category:19th-century conflicts",
