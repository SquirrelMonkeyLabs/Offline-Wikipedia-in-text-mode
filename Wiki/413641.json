 "text": "A bipolar junction transistor (BJT or bipolar transistor) is a type of transistor that relies on the contact of two types of semiconductor in order for it to work. BJTs can be used as amplifiers, switches, or in oscillators. BJTs can be found either on their own, or in large numbers as parts of integrated circuits.Bipolar transistors: device, principle and modes of operation, switching circuit, application, main parameters They are named bipolar transistors because their operation involves both electrons and holes. The current gained is measured in hfe, Forward Current Gain. Typical amount can be between 200-350. ==Other websites== * Simulation of a BJT in the Common Emitter Circuit == References == Category:Electronics",
