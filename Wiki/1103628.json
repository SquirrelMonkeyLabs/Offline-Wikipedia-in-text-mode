 "text": "Slough bus station is a bus station in Slough, Berkshire, United Kingdom. The bus station is next to Slough railway station. == History == The 1970s Slough bus station was partially demolished in February 2010 so a new bus station could be built. Services started using the new bus station on 28 May 2011. The bus station was largely damaged by a fire on 29 October 2022. It started from a parked bus and spread across the roof of the station. It damaged three other buses that were being stored overnight and forced bus operators to use temporary bus stands nearby. It is still closed . == References == Category:Transport in England",
