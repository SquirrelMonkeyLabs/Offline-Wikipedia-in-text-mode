 "text": "thumb|right|250px| The Ouija (pronounced wee-jee or wee-jah) is a game board supposedly used to talk to the dead. It is designed to be a fun activity based on self-deception. They are also called \"spirit boards\" or \"talking boards.\" It is a flat board with the numbers 0-9 and all the letters of the alphabet. It has the words \"yes\" and \"no\" at the top with the word \"goodbye\" on the bottom. The board uses a planchette, which is a small wooden plank in the shape of an upside down heart. It has a glass circle (or plain hole) in the top. The player asks a question, then one or more players guide the planchette to the letters or numbers to spell out a message. A participant believes they are not controlling the message, that it comes from ghosts or spirits. However, scientists know the game is based on the ideomotor effect. It can seem very mysterious, but anyone can test a Ouija board by blindfolding or hiding the board from the ones moving the planchette. What usually results is gibberish and no message. == References == == Other websites == * Do You Believe? | Brain Games; National Geographic * The Truth About Ouija Boards / How to make your own!:YouTube * How Ouija Boards Work; HowStuffWorks Category:Board games",
