 "text": "Jordan's casque-headed tree frog (Trachycephalus jordani) is a frog that lives in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Scientists have only seen it below 1000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 6.6 to 8.4 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 7.7 to 9.8 cm long. The adult frog has large feet for its size. It has disks on its toes for climbing. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lives in trees. Scientists have seen it in secondary forests, in some drier areas, and near the edges of places that human beings have changed. It goes into holes in trees to rest. It uses its head to cover the opening in the hole. The frog is named after Dr. David S. Jordan of Leland Stanford Junior University of California. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
