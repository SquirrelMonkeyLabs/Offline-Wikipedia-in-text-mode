Both distributions use the same software repositories. Most differences are on the desktop. Debian has a vastly larger support community than deepin. However, the majority of Debian help and advice is also applicable to deepin. Debian and deepin support also x86-64 CPU architecture. Many popular multimedia codecs are not installed by default in deepin. deepin and many other gratis GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu, do not distribute these codecs with the initial install media due to patent encumberment issues. deepin 2014.x was based on Ubuntu; Ubuntu and deepin both focus on usability, but deepin offers a different user experience (DDE) and it includes a number of applications that are not available in Ubuntu (Deepin Store). ==Related pages== * GNU/Linux * Debian * GNOME * List of Linux distributions == References == == Other websites == * Official WebSite * Previous official WebSite * Official Weblog ** Mailing List * Source code on GitHub * Source code on GitCafe Category:Linux distributions Category:Debian-based Linux distributions",
