 "text": "Margot Duhalde (12 December 1920 â€“ 5 February 2018) was a Chilean pilot. She served with the Air Transport Auxiliary of the Royal Air Force in World War II. After the war, she flew war planes for the French Air Force. She was France's first female combat pilot. In 1947 she returned to Chile, however the national airline LAN did not hire women as pilots at that time. Instead, she took a job as a private pilot for a businessman until 1949. Later she opened her own flying school and worked as a flight instructor and as an air traffic controller in the air force. In 1946 Duhalde was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Aviators Category:Chilean businesspeople Category:World War II people",
