 "text": "The Extensible Markup Language (short XML) is a markup language like HTML but is extensible. It's created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). XML defines rules for the construction of a document. XML adds context to the information in a document. It does not say how this should be displayed. Some programs get information out of an XML-document. To do that, they need an API. There are many APIs for XML.JSON was built to replace this purpose of XML. You can write a description of an XML document in a way that is useful for programmers. There are several languages for this; the best known is called DTD. == Syntax == XML uses less than (<) and greater than (>) to show tags. For example, a paragraph in HTML would be `<p>`. A closing tag is a tag used to enclose the value of the tag. The tag has a slash (/) before its name. For example, `</p>` A tag which is empty can be represented as an opening tag but with a slash before the `>`. For example, `<p/>` (or `<p />`) The XML specification defines a valid XML document as a well-formed XML document which also conforms to the rules of a Document Type Definition (DTD). == Languages == The following languages are based on XML. === Text === * XSL-FO * DocBook * DITA * XHTML (HTML based on ALL) * TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) * NITF (News Industry Text Format) === Images === * SVG (vector graphics) * X3D (3D modelling language) * Collada (Language to change informations between different 3D programs) === Earth === * Geography Markup Language (GML) * GPS Exchange Format (GPX): XML for GPS informatons * Keyhole Markup Language (KML): coordinates for Google Earth * OpenImmo : XML for Houses with position informations === Multimedia === * SMIL (Informations with times from multimedia) * MPEG-7 (for MPEG-7) * Laszlo (LZX) === Safety === * SAML (describe and send informations about safety) * XML Signature * XML Encryption === Other === There are a lot more languages that use XML.
