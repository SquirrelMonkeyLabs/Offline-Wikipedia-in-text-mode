 "text": "Lend-Lease was a program of the United States government put into place right before World War II. The United States was still trying to be neutral in the War, but wanted to give supplies to the Allied Powers (Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union). The U.S. gave the Allies several billion dollars of weapons. The Allies gave the United States rights to air and naval bases around the world, as well as billions in future monies. This money was not fully given until 2006. Category:Federal government of the United States Category:World War II",
