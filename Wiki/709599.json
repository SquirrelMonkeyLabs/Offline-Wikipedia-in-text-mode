 "text": "A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cerebral AVM, CAVM, cAVM) is a rare connection between the arteries and veins in the brain. It is an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum. In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain (intracranial hemorrhage). In more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom. The most problems related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures, cranial nerve deficits, backaches, neckaches and eventually nausea. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the brain Category:Diseases",
