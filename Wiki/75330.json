 "text": "The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was one of the Ernestine duchies. Ernest, who became elector of Saxony in 1464, divided his territory between his sons, and over the years more and more small duchies existed. Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld was reformed on 29 July 1735, although Coburg and Saalfeld had had the same ruler since 1699. As only men could be the rulers of the duchies, Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld ceased to exist in 1825, when the last male descendant of the dukes of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg died. The various dukes reorganised their territories. Saalfeld went the dukes of Saxe-Meiningen, Altenburg went to the Duke of Saxe- Hildburgausen, who gave Hildburghausen to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. Gotha and Coburg were combined into the new duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. == Dukes of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld == Reign starts Reign ends Duke 29 July 1735 4 September 1745 Christian Ernst jointly with 29 July 1735 16 September 1764 Franz Josias 16 September 1764 8 September 1800 Ernst Frederick 8 September 1800 9 December 1806 Franz Frederick 9 December 1806 27 January 1807 Ernst Anton Karl Ludwig 27 January 1807 28 July 1807 Occupied by France for one night 28 July 1807 12 November 1826 Ernst Anton Karl Ludwig Category:House of Wettin Category:States of the Confederation of the Rhine Category:States of the German Confederation Category:States of the Holy Roman Empire Category:Thuringia",
