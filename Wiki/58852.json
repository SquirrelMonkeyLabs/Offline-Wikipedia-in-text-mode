 "text": "Nicolas Sarkozy (born 28 January 1955), born Nicolas Paul Stéphane Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa is a French politician. He was the 23rd President of France and, because of that position, ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra from 16 May 2007 to 15 May 2012 succeeding Jacques Chirac. He was the leader of the UMP, and was elected President of the French Republic on 6 May 2007. He defeated Ségolène Royal, of the Socialist Party. ==Political career== Nicolas Sarkozy was known for his conservative law and order politics and his admiration for a new economic model for France during his presidency. He wanted a more liberalised economy for France because he saw the United States and the United Kingdom as positive examples. Until 26 March 2007, he was the Minister of the Interior of France. His nickname Sarko was used by both supporters and opponents. On 6 May 2012, Sarkozy was defeated in the 2012 election by Socialist François Hollande by a margin of 3.2%, or 1,139,983 votes. After leaving the office, Sarkozy pretended to retire from political life. As a former president, Sarkozy is entitled to de jure membership in the Constitutional Council. He retired from the council a few months later. ==Corruption trial== On 23 November 2020, a corruption trial started. He was accused for an attempted bribery of a judge. The trial was postponed until November 26, following a request from one of his co-defendants for health reasons. On March 1, 2021, a court in Paris found former Sarkozy guilty of corruption, trading in influence in a wiretapping and illegal data exchange. Sarkozy and his two co-defendants were sentenced to three years, two of them suspended, and one in prison. On December 18, 2024, the Court of Cassation rejected Nicolas Sarkozy's appeal in cassation and the co-defendants, thus making Nicolas Sarkozy's conviction final, who immediately announced that they would refer the matter to the European Court of Human Rights. He appeals the court decision immediatly, and contests the partiality of the judges whom he considers to be a reference of a certain non-objective left-wing morality. == Notes == == Other websites == === Official websites === * Nicolas Sarkozy Construire Ensemble—Official web site of the presidential campaign * Website of the UMP, Sarkozy's party * Nicolas Sarkozy–Official Website * Supporters de Sarkozy–Official Website of Nicolas Sarkozy's supporters === Press === * Charlie Rose show 02.02.07 (video interview at Place Beauvau, Paris with PBS journalist Charlie Rose, 30.01.07) * Sarkozy takes over Chirac's UMP party (BBC) * Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy (BBC) * Nicolas Sarkozy: French Choose the American Way? by David Storobin * Vive this difference by Suzanne Fields * France's chance, Economist, 12 April 2007 * Letter From Europe- Round 1 Jane Kramer, The New Yorker, April 23, 2007 === Related contents === * Some Nicolas Sarkozy's quotations (French) * Sarkozy 2007 — Website to promote Nicolas Sarkozy's candidacy in 2007 Category:French Roman Catholics Category:French lawyers Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Presidents of France Category:Princes of Andorra Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:French Ministers of Finance Category:French criminals Category:21st-century presidents of France Category:21st-century princes of Andorra",
