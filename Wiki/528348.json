 "text": "ASASSN-15lh is a supernova detected on 14 June 2015. It is the most luminous supernova ever detected.Amos, Jonathan 2016. Colossal star explosion detected. BBC News Science & Environment. At its brightest it was 50 times brighter than the whole Milky Way. :\"The exploding star was first observed back in June last year but is still radiating vast amounts of energy. At its peak, the event was 200 times more powerful than a typical supernova, making it shine with 570 billion times the brightness of our Sun. Researchers think the explosion and ongoing activity have been boosted by a very dense, highly magnetised, remnant object called a magnetar. This object, created as the supernova got going, is probably no bigger than a major city, such as London, and is likely spinning at a fantastic rate - perhaps a thousand times a second\". The supernova is some 3.8 billion light- years from Earth. It was found by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). ==References== Category:Supernovae Category:2015",
