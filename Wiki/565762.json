It is estimated that in the nearly four-year war killed as many as 200,000 people, while over 2,000,000 people had to leave their homes. According to more recent reports, the war killed around 94,000 inhabitants, and displaced about 1,800,000 people. The war was caused by a complex combination of the general political, social and security crisis in the country, which followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the socialist system in Yugoslavia. The war ended with the signing Peace Agreement in Dayton, Ohio on 21 November 1995. ==References== Category:1990s conflicts Category:Bosnian genocide Category:Wars involving Europe Category:1990s in Bosnia and Herzegovina",
