It included a 24-hour television channel available with an antenna, a video on demand service, and a weekly programming block on Ion Television under the name \"Qubo Kids Corner\", which was its sister network, along with the same block on another sister channel, Ion Plus. Qubo closed after Ion Media's acquisition by the E. W. Scripps Company.etworks-move/ Qubo began in September 2006. It was developed by several companies together, including Ion Media Networks, Corus Entertainment, Scholastic Corporation, Classic Media, and NBC. It was to be a \"building block for kids\" (as stated by president Rick Rodriquez). Like Ion, Qubo would air blocks on NBC and in Spanish on Telemundo. This happened until 2012, when NBC was bought by the cable company Comcast and that company took off Qubo programming for a new block from Sprout, which Comcast already owned. Spanish audio was also available through a second audio program on the Qubo channel itself. It also had its shows on a website accessible on-demand. Following Ion Media's acquisition by the E. W. Scripps Company, it ceased operations on February 28, 2021. ==Programming== ==References== Category:American television networks Category:Defunct companies of the United States Category:2006 establishments in the United States Category:2021 disestablishments in the United States",
