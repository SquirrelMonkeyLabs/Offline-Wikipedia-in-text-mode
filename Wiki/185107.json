 "text": "The Flying Spaghetti Monster is the god of Pastafarianism. It is often seen as a parody religion and thus has become popular with people opposed to the idea that God or gods created the world. Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster are sometimes called Pastafarians. The multiverse theory has suggested that what began as a spoof has become potentially real in the infinite universes and their countless creatures with at least some matching the general description of the FSM. Bobby Henderson first described the Flying Spaghetti Monster in 2005 in a letter to the Kansas State Board of Education. Henderson wrote the letter to protest rules about teaching intelligent design in public schools. The Board of Education required teachers to teach intelligent design. The Church's website (spaghettimonster.org) contains several sighting of 'His Noodlieness', multiple propaganda resources and an ordination package available for $49. This package contains a paper certificate of ordination, a black/silverresin wallet card and two vinyl car decals. The package also comes with free shipping. As the church states, 'Great. Consider yourself a member. You’ll notice there’s no hoops to jump through. You don’t need to pay anything.' == Photos == FSM Logo.svg|Logo Cuddly Flying Spaghetti Monster.jpg|The Flying Spaghetti Monster as a cuddly toy Kevgir.JPG|The colander is a holy object in Pastafarianism Touched by His Noodly Appendage HD.jpg|Creation of man according to the religion of the Flying Spaghetti Monster ==Related pages== * Evolution * Kitzmiller v.
