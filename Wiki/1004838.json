The Bureau of Shinto Affairs was an organization during the Meiji era that united different Shinto groups across Japan. It was a public institution and had a student dormitory to train priests. It was also responsible for accrediting Sect Shinto. The Bureau of Shinto Affairs trained priests but faced conflicts over differences in beliefs. This led to the Ise sect becoming more prominent and the Izumo sect being marginalized. In 1882, the Bureau of Shinto Affairs was turned into a Shinto sect due to a government ordinance requiring the separation of shrine priests and missionaries or theologians. As a result, in 1884, the missionaries of both Shinto and Buddhism were suppressed. The government then established the Office of Japanese Classics Research as a replacement for the Bureau. In 1886, the Bureau of Shinto Affairs reorganized itself as the Shinto Headquarters (Shinto Honkyoku) and later changed its name to Shinto Taikyo. In 1912, a group called The Thirteen Schools of Shinto including the Shinto Headquarters joined together to create the Kyoha Shinto Rengokai (Association of Sectarian Shinto).. == Related pages == * Taikyo Institute * Sect Shinto == References == == Other websites == * Shinto Taikyo (sect of Shinto) Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:State Shinto Category:Taikyo Institute",
