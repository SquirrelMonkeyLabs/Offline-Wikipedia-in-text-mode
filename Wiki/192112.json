 "text": "Stephen Appiah (born 24 December 1980) is a Ghanaian football player. He played for Ghana national team. Appiah was a talented, tenacious, and physically strong, all-round box-to-box midfielder, who was capable of defending well, as well as orchestrating attacks, creating chances for teammates, and even scoring goals himself, due to his vision, technique, aggressive tackling, athletic attributes, stamina, and his powerful and accurate shot from distance with his right foot. A versatile, powerful, and hard-working player, he was capable of playing anywhere in midfield, and adapting himself to several different formations, but usually operated in the centre of the pitch. Regarded as one of the best African football players of all time. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League Cup Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Udinese 1997–98 Serie A 11 0 0 0 – – 11 0 1998–99 21 0 6 3 – 2 0 29 3 1999–00 4 0 0 0 1 0 – 5 0 Total 36 0 6 3 1 0 2 0 45 3 Parma 2000–01 Serie A 15 0 5 1 6 1 – 26 2 2001–02 13 0 3 0 7 0 – 23 0 Total 28 0 8 1 13 1 0 0 49 2 Brescia (loan) 2002–03 Serie A 31 7 1 0 0 0 – 32 7 Juventus 2003–04 Serie A 30 1 8 0 7 0 1 0 46 1 2004–05 18 2 2 0 3 0 – 23 2 Total 48 3 10 0 10 0 1 0 69 3 Fenerbahçe 2005–06 Süper Lig 32 8 6 1 6 2 – 44 11 2006–07 26 3 1 0 10 3 – 37 6 2007–08 6 0 1 0 2 0 – 9 0 Total 64 11 8 1 18 5 0 0 90 17 Bologna 2009–10 Serie A 2 0 0 0 0 0 – 2 0 Cesena 2010–11 Serie A 14 0 1 0 0 0 – 15 0 Vojvodina 2011–12 SuperLiga 11 1 2 0 0 0 – 13 1 Career total 234 22 36 5 42 6 3 0 315 33 ===International=== Appearances and goals by national team and year National team Year Apps Goals Ghana 1995 1 0 1996 0 0 1997 0 0 1998 2 0 1999 1 0 2000 5 1 2001 5 2 2002 2 0 2003 5 3 2004 5 2 2005 7 2 2006 16 2 2007 3 1 2008 3 1 2009 7 1 2010 5 0 Total 67 15 ==Honours== Hearts of OakStephen Appiah at Soccerway * Ghana Premier League: 1996–97 * Ghanaian FA Cup: 1996 Parma * Coppa Italia: 2001–02 Juventus * Serie A: 2004–05 * Supercoppa Italiana: 2003 Fenerbahçe * Süper Lig: 2006–07 * Turkish Super Cup: 2007 Ghana U17 * FIFA U-17 World Championship: 1995 Individual * SWAG Most Promising Football Star of the Year: 1997 * Summer Olympic Football All-Star Team: 2004 * Ghana Footballer of the Year: 2005, 2007 * Footballer of the Year in Turkey: 2007 * African Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament: 2006 ==Notes== == References == Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Ghanaian footballers Category:Sportspeople from Accra",
