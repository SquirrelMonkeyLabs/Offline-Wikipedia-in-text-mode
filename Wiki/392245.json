 "text": "Kandyan jewellery comes from Ceylon or Sri Lanka. The Kandyan Kingdom disappeared in 1815 but some jewellery and designs are still being used by Kandyan families today. Kandyan jewellery is handmade and was originally designed for the royal families. It is a symbol of wealth, solidarity and strength. It is worn by women of royal or noble births and not women of lower castes. Bridal pieces are the most important pieces of Kandyan jewellery. They are handmade and consist of 26 pieces of jewellery that will be worn by the bride. Saturday, July 4, 2020 ==References== Category:Jewelry Category:Sri Lanka",
