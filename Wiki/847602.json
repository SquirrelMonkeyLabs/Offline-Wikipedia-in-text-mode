 "text": "Robert Smalls (April 5, 1839 – February 23, 1915) was an American politician, publisher, businessman, and Maritime pilot. Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina. He freed himself, his friends, and their families during the American Civil War. He did this by commandeering a Confederate transport ship, CSS Planter, in Charleston harbor, on May 13, 1862. He then sailed it from Confederate-controlled waters of the harbor to the U.S. blockade that surrounded it. He then piloted the ship to the Union-controlled enclave in Beaufort–Port Royal–Hilton Head area, where it became a Union warship. His example and persuasion helped convince President Abraham Lincoln to allow African-American soldiers into the Union Army. ==Early life== Robert Smalls was born in 1839 to Lydia Polite, a slave owned by Henry McKee. She gave birth to him in a cabin behind McKee's house, at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort, South Carolina. He grew up in the city under the influence of the Lowcountry Gullah culture of his mother. His mother lived as a servant in the house, but she grew up in the fields. Robert was liked more than other slaves, so his mother worried that he might grow up not understanding the troubles of field slaves. She asked for him to be made to work in the fields and to see whipping. ==References== ==Other websites== *Q&A; interview with Cate Lineberry on her book Be Free or Die: The Amazing Story of Robert Smalls' Escape from Slavery to Union Hero, August 6, 2017, C-SPAN *Entry from the House of Representatives *In the episode \"Robert Smalls\" of the podcast Criminal, published on June 19, 2020, Phoebe Judge tells the story of Robert Smalls. *Robert Smalls: Former Slave and Civil War Hero, Hagley Museum and Library *In the episode \"The Wheel\" of the podcast The Memory Palace, published on February 10, 2016, Nate DiMeo tells the story of Robert Smalls. * *The episodes \"The Incredible Escape of Robert Smalls\" published on February 15, 2016 and \"Robert Smalls: From Contraband to Congress\" published on February 17, 2016 of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, tell the story of Robert Smalls' life.
