 "text": "The Temple in Jerusalem or Holy Temple (, transliterated Bet HaMikdash, which means literally \"The Holy House\") stood on the Temple Mount (Har HaBayit) in the old city of Jerusalem. According to classical Jewish belief, it was the \"footstool\" of God's presence in the physical world. It was the place where Jews brought all the offerings described in the Torah.Mainly see Book of Leviticus and Book of Numbers. The First Temple, also called Solomon's Temple, was built by King Solomon in seven years during the 10th century BCE and has been dated astronomically to 957 BCE.Erwin Reidinger: \"The Temple Mount Platform in Jerusalem from Solomon to Herod: An Archaeological Re- Examination.\" In Assaph, Studies in Art of History, Volume 9, Tel Aviv 2004, 1-64. It was the center of ancient Judaism.Books of Chronicles, 1 Chronicles, chapter 22 - 29 This first Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. A new temple was built from 535 BCE to 516 BCE. That was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. All of the outer walls still stand, although the Temple itself has long since been destroyed. The Islamic Dome of the Rock has stood on the site of the Temple since the late 7th Century CE. The al-Aqsa Mosque, from roughly the same period, also stands on the Temple courtyard. ==Related pages== * Al-Aqsa Mosque * Second Temple ==References== ==Other websites== * About the Temple of Jerusalem * visit of the Temple Institute Museum in Jerusalem conducted by Rav Israel Ariel Category:Ancient Israel and Judah Category:Buildings and structures in Jerusalem Category:Judaism Category:Judaism in Israel",
