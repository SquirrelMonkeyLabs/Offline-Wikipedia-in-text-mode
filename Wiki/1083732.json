It lives in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, and some islands in the South China Sea. People have seen them as high as 1300 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests. It can lay eggs in ditches and other bodies of water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it can live in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
