The album is Aguilera's first in nearly six years and her last one with RCA Records before leaving in 2024. She started working on it in 2014 and worked with different music producers and songwriters to create the sound she wanted. Some artists who helped with the album included Anderson .Paak, Kanye West, and Tayla Parx. She also sang with Demi Lovato, Keida, Shenseea, GoldLink, Ty Dolla Sign, 2 Chainz, and Lewis Hamilton (who used the name “XNDA”). The album had three singles: “Accelerate,” “Fall in Line,” and “Like I Do”. People liked the album, especially Christina’s voice and the mix of different sounds. It was a success in many countries, reaching the top 10 in nine places, including the U.S., where it was number six on the Billboard charts. It was also number one in Spain, number three in Switzerland, and number five in Canada. Two songs, “Fall in Line” (with Demi Lovato) and “Like I Do” (with GoldLink), were considered for Grammy Awards.
