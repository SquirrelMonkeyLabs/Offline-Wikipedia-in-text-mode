 "text": "A vowel is a particular kind of speech sound made by changing the shape of the upper vocal tract, or the area in the mouth above the tongue. A vowel letter is a letter of an alphabet that represents a vowel sound. In English, five letters in the alphabet are usually called the vowel letters. The sounds of English are written with letters in the English alphabet, as either vowels or consonants. All English words are written with vowel letters in them. These letters are vowels in English: :A, E, I, O and U (and sometimes Y) It is said that Y is \"sometimes\" a vowel because it can either be spoken with a vowel or consonant sound, depending on the word. In the words cry, sky, fly, my and why, the letter Y represents the vowel sound /aɪ/. In words like myth and synchronize, it represents the vowel sound /ɪ/. In words like only, quickly, and folly, it represents the vowel sound /i/. The letter Y can also be a consonant sound called a glide as in the beginning of these words: yellow, yacht, yam, yesterday. Y is a consonant about 2.5% of the time, and a vowel about 97.5% of the time. The letter W can sometimes be the second part of a vowel sound, as in words such as cow, bow, or how. In these words, the vowel has the sound of /aʊ/. The letter W can be used as a consonant sound at the beginning of in the words when, where, wet. In some languages, like Welsh, the letter W represents the vowel sound /ʊ/, like in the word cwm (a kind of valley; pronounced “coom\"). A few of these words may be borrowed in English, with the W representing its vowel sound. In written English, the vowel letters are used to represent the 13-15 vowel sounds (depending on the variety) in English.Crystal, David 1995. The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English language. Cambridge. p237 This means there are many more vowel sounds than letters in the English alphabet, and the English spelling system does not always show readers which sound a vowel letter represents in a word. This can cause confusion for people learning the English language. * The rest of the letters of the alphabet are consonants: :B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y and Z (and sometimes A, E, I, O and U) == Monophthongs and diphthongs == Simple vowels are called monophthongs. The letters, like /ɪ/, are the IPA letters for each vowel sound in English. (The IPA is the International Phonetic Alphabet). In the IPA, each symbol represents a different sound, so using the IPA is helpful in pronouncing words. Common monophthongs in English (these are for General American English) include: * /i/ as in pol _i_ ce, f _ee_ t, _ea_ t, and sill _y_ * /ɪ/ as in _i_ t, s _i_ t, k _i_ ck, m _y_ th and b _i_ tter * /ɛ/ as in _e_ nd, b _e_ t, l _e_ ss, and l _e_ tter * /æ/ as in _a_ t, _a_ pple, f _a_ t, and m _a_ tter * /u/ as in c _oo_ l, t _u_ ne, s _ou_ p, and kung f _u,_ * /ʊ/ as in c _oo_ k, sh _ou_ ld, p _u_ dding, f _oo_ t, and r _ook_ * /ʌ/ as in b _u_ s, bl _oo_ d, c _o_ me, and _u_ p * /ə/ as in kingd _o_ m, ph _o_ togr _a_ phy, ph _i_ los _o_ phy, ketch _u_ p, and hundr _e_ d * /ɚ/ as in butt _er_ , coll _ar_ , flav _or_ , f _ir_ m, and b _ur_ st * /ɔ/ as in _a_ ll, f _ou_ ght, h _o_ t, and b _o_ t * /ɑ/ as in f _a_ ther, w _a_ lk, _a_ rm, h _ea_ rt, w _a_ sp, l _a_ ger, _e_ nvelope and _aa_ rdv _a_ rk Diphthongs are a combination of two different vowel sounds, one vowel sounds turns into another sound as you say them. If you pronounce the words below slowly, you can hear the two vowel sounds of the diphthongs. Common diphthongs in English include: * /eɪ/ as in _a_ te, r _ei_ gn, v _ai_ n, fl _a_ vor, sl _ay_ , and conv _ey_ * /oʊ/ as in t _oe_ , r _ow_ , g _o_ , b _oa_ t, m _o_ de, and chat _eau_ * /aɪ/ as in _eye_ , _I_ , p _ie_ , cr _y_ , c _y_ pher, cl _i_ mb, l _i_ me, l _i_ ght, k _ay_ ak, Th _ai_ , and h _ei_ ght * /aʊ/ as in l _ou_ d, h _ou_ se, c _ow_ , ab _ou_ t, D _ao_ ism, and Mac _au_ * /oɪ/ as in b _oy_ , m _oi_ st, and Fr _eu_ d Like other languages, there are many dialects of English, and different dialects often use different vowel sounds. But the IPA symbols can tell us which vowel sound a dialects uses. For example, some American English speakers differentiate between the vowels in the words cot and caught, while in other dialects these words are homophones. People who study the differences between the dialects of English often study the different way vowel sounds are pronounced. The difference between the way English is spelled and the way the words are pronounced came about because all languages change, so spoken English changes, but the spelling system does not. The study of speech sounds is called phonetics. == Related pages == * Orthography * Dialect * Diphthong == References ==",
