Some years later, Thor is heir to the throne of Asgard (the world of the gods), but his crowning is stopped by some Frost Giants (that were let in by his brother Loki). Thor and his friends go to Jotunheim (the world of the Frost Giants) and attack Laufey, the Frost Giant leader, but are saved by Odin. Odin is angry at Thor and sends him to Earth as a normal person. Thor lands in New Mexico and meets and develops romance with astrophysicist Jane Foster. Meanwhile in Asgard, Loki finds out he is actually Laufey’s son, and plans to ascend to the throne and sends the Destroyer (a weapon) to kill Thor. Thor dies but shows that he is worthy, and his powers come back. Thor goes back to Asgard and fights Loki, who falls off the Bifrost and dies. ==Cast== * Chris Hemsworth as Thor * Natalie Portman as Jane Foster * Tom Hiddleston as Loki * Stellan Skarsgård as Dr. Erik Selvig * Colm Feore as Laufey * Ray Stevenson as Volstagg * Idris Elba as Heimdall * Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis * Rene Russo as Frigga * Anthony Hopkins as Odin * Tadanobu Asano as Hogun * Josh Dallas as Fandral * Jamie Alexander as Sif ==Future== ===Sequels=== ====Thor: The Dark World==== ====Thor: Ragnarok==== ====Thor: Love and Thunder==== ==References== == Other websites == * * * * * Category:2011 movies Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One movies Category:2010s superhero movies Category:Thor movies Category:Movies directed by Kenneth Branagh",
