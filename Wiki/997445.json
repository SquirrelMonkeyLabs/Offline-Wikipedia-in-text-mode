 "text": "Gros Michel (), is a type of banana, that was the most popular type grown until the 1950s. == Decline == Gros Michels decline was mostly due to its vulnerability to the Panama Disease, which caused harm to multiple banana cultivars, including Gros Michel. The disease caused almost $400,000,000 in damages. == Usage == The Gros Michel bananas' flavoring is commonly used in artificial banana foods. This causes artifical banana foods to less resemble common bananas, due to Gros Michels having a higher amount of a chemical called isoamyl acetate. == References == Category:Fruits",
