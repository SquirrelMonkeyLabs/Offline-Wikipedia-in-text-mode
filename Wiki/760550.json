 "text": "Brantley County is a county in the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2020 census, 18,021 people lived there. The county seat is Nahunta. On November 2, 1920, voters in Georgia approved a state constitutional amendment creating Brantley County from portions of Charlton, Pierce, and Wayne counties, three previous neighboring Georgia counties. It is thought that the county name honors either U.S. Representative (congressman) William Gordon Brantley or his father, Benjamin Daniel Brantley, a prominent local businessman and Confederate States Army veteran during the American Civil War (1861-1865), while the exact origin of the name is unknown. ==References== Category:1920 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Georgia (U.S. state) counties",
