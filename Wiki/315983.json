 "text": "Interstate 470 (I-470) is a long loop of Interstate 70. It goes around the city of Wheeling, West Virginia. The western end of the road is where it meets I-70 near Blaine, Ohio. Traveling southeast through Belmont County, the highway comes to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge which carries I-470 over the Ohio River. After crossing the river into Ohio County, West Virginia, the highway turns northeast. It runs towards the Wheeling neighborhood of Elm Grove. The road's eastern end is at I-70 near Wheeling Park. On average, between 26,000 and 38,000 vehicles use the highway every day. During the rebuilding work on the Wheeling Tunnel, I-470 was one of two suggested detour routes to avoid the closed tunnel. ==References== ==Other websites== * *Interstate 470 at AA Roads *Interstate 470 (in Ohio) at State Ends 470",
