 "text": "An identifier can be termed as a name given to something unique, an object, or a set of objects. It may be an idea, a person, a physical object, or some substance. ID is an abbreviation to often mean either identity, identification, or identifier. Identifiers can be words, numbers, letters, symbols, or a mix of these. They might follow a system (where symbols represent ideas or longer names) or be random. When they follow a system, they are often called codes. An example could be a set of symbols that stand for longer values. If they don’t follow a system, they are called arbitrary IDs and have no special meaning. A unique identifier (UID) refers to only one specific thing. For instance, a part number identifies a kind of part, but the serial number for each part identifies it uniquely. Thus, \"Model T\" identifies a type of car, but \"Model T Serial Number 159,862\" identifies one particular car. The terms name and identifier are synonymous, yet the terms are not uniformly used the same way. For example, “Jamie Zawinski” is a name, while “Netscape employee number 20” is an identifier. Both refer to the same person, yet we normally refer to the first as a name and to the second as an identifier. Category:Identifiers Category:Metadata",
