It takes place during WrestleMania week and is the most important event that NXT has. All shows are streamed live on Peacock in the United States and on Netflix and the WWE Network internationally. The first event, which was held in 2021, also aired on the USA Network and traditional pay-per-view channels. The 2021 edition was a two-night show and was also a part of the NXT TakeOver series, which ended later that year. Since 2022, NXT Stand & Deliver is now a one-day event.
