He was born in Schwetzingen on 27 May 1756. After his father died of testicular cancer in 1767, he was left without parental supervision (after her mother was banished after one of her son's father was an actor) and was taken care by his uncle Duke Christian IV of Zweibrücken. Christian settled him in the Hôtel des Deux-Ponts. He became Count of Rappoltstein in 1776 or 1778 and took service in 1777 as a colonel in the French Royal Army. He rose rapidly to the rank of major-general. From 1782 to 1789, he was stationed at Strasbourg. During his time at the University of Strasbourg, Klemens von Metternich, the future Austrian chancellor, was for some time accommodated by Prince Maximilian.
