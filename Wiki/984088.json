 "text": "The Silky Spitz (in German: Seidenspitz) was a breed of dog. It was also known as the Silky-Haired Spitz. The dog was bred in Germany around 1800. It was created by mating the white Pomeranian with the Maltese. The Silky Spitz had a pure white colored coat. It had the long silky hair of the Maltese and pricked ears of the Pomeranian. The nose and eyes of the dog were both very black. The Silky Spitz was a delicate dog. It had feet similar to those of a rabbit. The dog was about the size of the Pomeranian. To make the dogs look more Pomeranian, the paws, ears and face were trimmed, This was because these areas were hairy like the Maltese. Breeding in Germany died out between World War I and World War II. There were some possible reasons for this. One of these is that the breed had small litters. there were usually only two puppies per litter. Inbreeding, a small number of breeders and diseases are also believed to be reasons for this. From 2005, the Seidenspitz was bred in the United States. == References == Category:Dog breeds",
