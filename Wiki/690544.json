 "text": "The New International Encyclopedia is an encyclopedia first published in 1902. The last edition was in 1935. ==History== The New International Encyclopedia was an update of The International Cyclopaedia, which was last published in 1884. In turn, the International Cyclopaedia was largely a copy of Alden's Library of Universal Knowledge. That in its turn was a reprint of Chambers's Encyclopaedia. The original 1902 edition was edited by Harry Thurston Peck, Daniel Colt Gilman, and Frank Moore Colby. The encyclopedia was printed in 1904, 1905, 1907, 1909, and 1911. Then a second edition was made from 1914 to 1917. By that time Peck and Gilman had died, so Talcott Williams helped edit. A 3rd edition was made in 1923, and more subjects were added to it in 1927 and 1930. A final edition was made in 1935. Some of the last edition became part of Funk & Wagnalls Standard Encyclopaedia. ==References== == Other websites == * New International Category:1902 books Category:1914 books Category:1923 books Category:1935 books",
