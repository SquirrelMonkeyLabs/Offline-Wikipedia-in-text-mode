It is a cake- like layered dessert with a base of semolina pudding, followed by a layer of whipped cream, topped with crushed pistachios and a sugar syrup. Beirut Nights is typically served for special occasions such as family gatherings, celebrations, and holidays. == Preparation and variations == The dessert consists of three layers: # Semolina pudding # Whipped cream # Pistachios and syrup The semolina pudding is made by bringing semolina, milk and sugar to medium heat and then whisking it until it forms a custard-like consitency. Customarily, rose or orange blossom water is added, as well as mastic. The pudding is then spread out in a tray and left to cool for at least two hours, often in the fridge. During this time, a syrup is prepared by boiling sugar, water, rose or orange blossom water with a chunk of lemon peel. Once cooled, cream is whipped and spread over the pudding, which is then topped with chopped pistachios and the syrup. The dessert is then cut up into squares and served. Sometimes, the pudding is not chilled in a tray but instead in glass or plastic cups and served individually, much like muhallebi. == Other websites == * Beirut Nights cake in mamaslebanesekitchen website Category:Middle Eastern foods",
