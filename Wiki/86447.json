Before consuming either of these, or any other nutritional substance, a special prayer is required. For meats, the spirit of the animal must be delivered.\"Casey, Noah. The True Buddha School: A Field Research Report on The Chan Hai Lei Zang Temple This is consistent with the Vajrayana traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. ==Controversies== Lu made headlines during an investigation by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission into his cash donations to Chinese American politician Gary Locke, who Lu had hoped would run for President of the United States. Locke was cleared of any wrongdoing by the commission in 1998.Anderson, Rick. Sex and the buddha in the Seattle Weekly, 5 September 2001. He was also sued in civil court by a former disciple, who called herself SHC, a 41-year-old Malaysian immigrant, over claims of sexual misconduct, after the King County, Washington prosecutor declined to file charges for lack of evidence. The case was dismissed by King County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Learned citing constitutional issues. In the case S.H.C. v. Sheng-Yen Lu,S.H.C. v. Sheng-Yen Lu the Superior Court of King County granted the Temple's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals later \"affirm[ed] the trial court's grant of summary judgment dismissing all claims against the Temple.\" Lu has been criticized by Tsering Phuri, the president of TIBETcenter, who said \"People should not say, `I am a living Buddha'\". However, this title was given by his disciples or people who believed in him 30 or 40 years ago in Taiwan, and Lu also admitted that he is the incarnated body of the Buddha. ==Notes== ==References== * Casey, Noah.
