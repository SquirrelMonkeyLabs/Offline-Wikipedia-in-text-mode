In Japan, it's named Ōgon no Taiyō Hirakareshi Fūin (, meaning Golden Sun: The Broken Seal). In 2003, the second of the series named Golden Sun: the Lost Age was released. The game's \"Djinn\" setting is unusual. The game's story take place on a magic world named \"Weyard\". It's an alchemy world, and alchemy can be controlled by adepts. Long long ago, Alchemy was sealed, but one day some young adepts let it return to Weyard. To keep world safety, they have to travel to let alchemy be sealed again. IGN's Craig Harris said Golden Sun \"is the best game in all 2D-based Japanese RPG\". == References == Category:2001 video games Category:Golden Sun video game series Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Video games about genies",
