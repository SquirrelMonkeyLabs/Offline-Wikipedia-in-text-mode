 "text": "The land hemisphere is the hemisphere on the Earth with the highest possible area of land. It is centered on (near the city of Nantes, France). (especially Figure 4.3) The other half of the Earth is the water hemisphere. The land hemisphere has seven eighths of the land on the Earth. This would be four fifths of the land area if Antarctica were included in the land area of the World. Europe, Africa, North America, most of Asia and most of South America are in the land hemisphere. Europe is at the center of the land hemisphere. Because the area of the oceans of the land hemisphere is bigger than its land area, the land hemisphere means the hemisphere where most land is. == References == Category:Hemispheres",
