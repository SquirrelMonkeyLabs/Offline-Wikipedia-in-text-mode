 "text": "Demilitarisation or demilitarization may mean the lowering of state armed forces. It is the opposite of militarisation. For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland caused a lowering of British security and military weapons. Another example is the demilitarisation of the Rhineland after World War 1. Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. ==References== ==Related pages== *Demilitarized zone Category:Military tactics",
