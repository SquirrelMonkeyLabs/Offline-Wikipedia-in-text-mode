 "text": "The \"North Dakota Hymn\" is the regional anthem (or \"state song\") of the U.S. state of North Dakota. It was written by a poet named James Foley in 1926 in such a way that it could be sung along with the tune of \"The Austrian Hymn\". C. S. Putman arranged the music with distinct ragtime syncopation. == Lyrics == :North Dakota, North Dakota, :With thy prairies wide and free, :All thy sons and daughters love thee, :Fairest state from sea to sea; :North Dakota, North Dakota, :Here we pledge ourselves to thee. :Hear thy loyal children singing, :Songs of happiness and praise, :Far and long the echoes ringing, :Through the vastness of thy ways; :North Dakota, North Dakota, :We will serve thee all our days. :Onward, onward, onward going, :Light of courage in thine eyes, :Sweet the winds above thee blowing, :Green thy fields and fair thy skies; :North Dakota, North Dakota, :Brave the Soul that in thee lies. :God of freedom, all victorious, :Give us Souls serene and strong, :Strength to make the future glorious, :Keep the echo of our song; :North Dakota, North Dakota, :In our hearts forever long.
