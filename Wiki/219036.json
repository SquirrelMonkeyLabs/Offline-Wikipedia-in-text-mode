The falls were often said to be over 640 feet tall, however, they recently measured to stand 410 feet tall, which is what the USGS Brush Creek 7 1/2\" quadrangle says. A town found nearby, Feather Falls, California, is named after this waterfall. ==References== Category:Waterfalls Category:Landforms of California Category:Butte County, California",
