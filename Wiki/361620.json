 "text": "The many-plumed moths are the Alucitidae, a family of moths with unusually modified wings.Tree of Life Web Project (ToL) 2003. Alucitoidea . Version of 2003-JAN-01. Retrieved 2011-SEP-24. Both fore- and hind-wings consist of about six rigid spines, from which radiate flexible bristles. They make a structure similar to a bird's feather. This is a small family, with 9 genera and 130 species. They are found mostly in temperate to subtropical (but not tropical) regions. They are rare even in parts of their core range; both in Great Britain and North America for example, only one species is found - the Twenty- plume Moth (Alucita hexadactyla) - and in America, it is introduced. This smallish moth may be found fluttering in the evening twilight or resting with its \"wings\" outstretched. Its larvae feed on honeysuckle (Lonicera). On the other hand, in Continental Europe there are many species, mostly of the large genus Alucita. == References == Category:Moths",
