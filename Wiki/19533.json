 "text": "Saturated fat is a kind of fat. It has no double bonds. It has carbon atoms that are fully saturated with hydrogen. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature. They have no double bonds, while unsaturated fat has one or two. Due to no double bonds, their oxidation process is slow. == Health == Saturated fat may be a risk factor for heart disease (CVD). The question has many controversial views. Although most in the mainstream heart-health, government, and medical communities hold that saturated fat is a risk factor for CVD, some recent studies have produced conflicting results. For a long time scientists have believed that eating saturated fat was a leading cause for heart attack, cancer, or other diseases. However, new research have shown that there is no connection between how much saturated fat you eat and heart diseases. This is still a controversial question. Things like butter, coconut, lard and meat have lots of saturated fat. == Compound == Saturated means that it holds all the hydrogen atoms that it can, meaning that all of the carbon (c) atoms have two hydrogen (H) atoms attached to it. == Types == *Stearic acid *Palmitic acid *Myristic acid *Lauric acid *Caproic acid *Caprylic acid *Capric acid *Butyric acid *Propionic acid *Acetic acid == Related pages == * Unsaturated fat * Polyunsaturated fat == Other websites == *Foods high in saturated fat. == References == Category:Lipids",
