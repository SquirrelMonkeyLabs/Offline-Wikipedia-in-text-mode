He was shot dead point-blank (from a very close range) by special forces officers on August 10, 2020, in Minsk. The government-run media tried to present it as something that happened through his own carelessness (failure to take the care that a cautious person usually takes). He was shot by the police on the evening of August 10, 2020, near Pushkinskaya metro station in Minsk. He was buried at Western cemetery in Minsk on August 15, 2020.У Менску разьвіталіся з загінулым падчас пратэстаў Аляксандрам Тарайкоўскім, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 15-08-2020 The death of Taraikovsky caused more protests.
