 "text": "The NHS health check was started by Gordon Brown in 2008. People between 40 and 74 in England can have a free checkup for heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and stroke. From 2016 to 2021, 46.5% of people took up the invitation for a checkup. It takes about 40 minutes. In Cornwall as a trial patients complete an online questionnaire, use a kit to take a blood sample at home, and complete a blood pressure check at their local pharmacy or in a GP waiting room. In Scotland there was a similar scheme called Keep Well. == References == Category:National Health Service",
