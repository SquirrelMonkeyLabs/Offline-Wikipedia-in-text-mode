She was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She was born in Windsor Castle. She grew up in Great Britain, Germany and Malta. In 1930, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and committed to a sanatorium in Switzerland. After that, she lived separately from her husband Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark. After the fall of King Constantine II of Greece and the imposition of military rule in Greece in 1967, she was invited by her son and daughter-in-law to live at Buckingham Palace in London. She died there two years later. ==References== ==Other websites== *Yad Vashem The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority * Category:1885 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Greek royalty Category:British princesses Category:Royalty from Berkshire Category:People with schizophrenia Category:Righteous Among the Nations Category:World War II people Category:Exiled royalty",
