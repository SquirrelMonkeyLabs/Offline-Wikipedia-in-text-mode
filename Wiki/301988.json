 "text": "A threat display is anything that an animal does to scare away other animals. A dog will bare its teeth and growl. A cat will hiss. A snake will coil up, raise its head, and move back and forth to point itself at any big animal that approaches it. Many animals have threat displays that make them look bigger. A lion's mane will stand up, making it look much larger and more powerful. Humans may raise both hands, spread wide, above their heads. Bears will stand on their hind legs, raise their front legs, and show their teeth while growling. Some notable animals have no threat display, but do have a defence all the same. A male horse has a terrific kick backwards, no doubt developed as a defence against predators. People who ride horses have to be told not to walk close behind a male horse, even if they have ridden it before. ==Related pages== *Fight or flight response *Mimicry *Threat Category:Ethology",
