 "text": "The United States Department of Defense employs civilian firefighters. They are stationed at military bases to work as firefighters. These workers have their own uniforms and equipment. They are not a part of any military unit. They will work alongside military units if needed. Many times, they are the only firefighters at a military facility. The civilian firefighters wear special uniforms, usually a dark blue suit with a badge and with a shoulder patch indicating their firefighting organization. Firefighters go to special classes to learn firefighting skills. They earn certificates after taking the classes. One major class is called \"DoD Fire & Emergency Services Training.\" Certification description , dtic.mil.DoD Fire & Emergency Services Training Conference , page at usfra.org. ==Related pages== * Firefighting ==References== ==Other websites== * Military Firefighter Heritage Foundation website. * U.S. Defense Dept.
