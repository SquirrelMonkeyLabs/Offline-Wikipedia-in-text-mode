Construction work began in 1939 but the shrine was never finished. Buyeo was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Baekje, which had a historical relationship with Japan. The Fuyo Jingu shrine was planned to be built in Buyeo as a symbol of Japan's permanent control over Korea. The shrine was intended to mark the incorporation of Korea into Japan. Four kami (spirits or deities) were meant to be enshrined at Fuyo Jingu: Emperor Ojin (also known as Hachiman), Empress K≈çgyoku, Emperor Tenji, and Empress Jingu. These deities were all associated with the conquest of Korea. According to legend, Empress Jingu delayed giving birth to her child in order to lead a military campaign to conquer Korea.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/151473165.pdf == References == Category:1930s establishments in Korea Category:1939 establishments in Asia Category:Hachiman shrines Category:Kanpei-taisha Category:Shinto shrines in the Japanese colonial empire",
