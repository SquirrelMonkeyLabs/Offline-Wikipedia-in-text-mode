II Invaluable heritage, that God protects to you You filled us priceless goods Our common culture identifies us Our single language unifies us That our intelligence, our conscience and our forces Fill you with varied riches For an unceasingly renewed development. III Our valorous ancestors Gave themselves bodies and souls As far as making you a big nation You overcame the colonial- imperialistic yoke That has devastated Africa entirely And has your joy of your sovereign independence Acquired that constantly we will defend. IV Maintain this cape, beloved Rwanda, Standing, we commit for you So that peace reigns countrywide That you are free of all hindrance That your determination hires progress That you have excellent relations with all countries And that finally your pride is worth your esteem. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:National symbols of Rwanda",
