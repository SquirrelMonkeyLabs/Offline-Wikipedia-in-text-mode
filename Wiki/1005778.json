According to the tale, during Emperor Jimmu's Eastern Expedition, Yatagarasu guided him from the Kumano Region to Yamato Province. Takamimusubi, one of the Shinto gods, sent the crow. Yatagarasu is usually shown as a bird with three legs, and its picture has been passed down for many years.. Its name comes from the words \"八咫烏,\" which means \"eight-span crow\" in Japanese. The number eight means a large lucky number in Japanese culture as in the phrase Yaoyorozu no Kami or eight million gods. So this means large wingspan crow In Shinto beliefs, when the great bird is seen, it is a sign of divine intervention in human affairs or the will of Heaven. The crow's guidance is regarded as a blessing and a good omen. == Related pages == * Sunspot * Three- legged crow -Explains the three-legged birds of other countries that are similar to the Yatagarasu. * List of Japanese deities * Huginn and Muninn, the Crow twin-familiars of Odin AllFather, King of the Gods in Norse mythology. == References == == Other websites == * * 日本サッカー協会 組織 - There is a description about Yatagarasu in the \"Symbol Mark\" section at the bottom of the site. * 八咫烏神社（奈良県宇陀市） Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Gods and goddesses of Japan",
