 "text": "The iPhone X and iPhone X Max (pronounced \"ten S\" and \"ten S Max\") are smartphones sold by Apple Inc. The two phone models were announced on September 12, 2018, at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California. Along with the lower-cost iPhone X, they are succeeding the iPhone X that was released in 2017. The X and X Max are available in silver, space gray, and gold, with 64, 256, or 512 GB storage options. The X has a 5.8″ OLED screen, while the Max has a 6.5″ OLED screen, the biggest on any iPhone ever. The X sells starting at US $999, while the X Max starts at US $1,099. Both models contain a notch that holds the front camera into place and also lack a home button, like the previous iPhone X. The X, X Max, and XR are the first iPhones to not include a Lightning-to-3.5 mm audio adapter. Lightning-to-3.5 mm audio adapters can only be bought separately. Pre-orders for the phones began on September 14, 2018, with the phones available to the public on September 21. ==References== ==Other websites== XS Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2018 Category:Mobile phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording",
