 "text": "Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj (), is a Trinidadian rapper, singer and songwriter based in the United States. She is known as the Queen of Rap and is the most successful female rapper of all time. She became the first and only female rapper to be listed on Forbes' Hip Hop Cash Kings list. == Background == Nicki Minaj moved to Queens, New York City at age five. Her father went to rehab for alcoholism in 2012. Minaj claimed he burned down their house in her youth. As a teenager, Minaj had an abortion, which is referenced in her song \"All Things Go\" from The Pinkprint. ==Career== === 2009 - 2011: Beginnings and Pink Friday === In August 2009, Nicki Minaj signed to Young Money Entertainment with distribution from Universal Motown. Her debut album, Pink Friday, was released on November 9, 2010. It climbed to number one on the US Billboard 200 album chart and contained the singles \"Your Love\", \"Moment 4 Life\" (featuring Canadian rapper Drake), \"Super Bass\", \"Did It on 'Em\", and \"Fly\" (featuring Barbadian singer Rihanna). The first, second, and fifth singles reached the top 20 in the US, while \"Super Bass\" managed to peak at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked in the top ten around the world. The song has been certified 8× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for combined shipments and streams of 8 million copies in the US alone. Minaj was also featured with Kesha on a remix of Britney Spears' song \"Till the World Ends\". Minaj has been instrumental in challenging the patriarchal norms of the music industry, as a Black female rapper. Additionally, in Minaj's early career she used sexuality as a way to gain fans and relate to audiences. She was able to gather a large female and LGBT+ identifying audience through her implying that she was bisexual herself. Through her wigs, costumes, and bold designs she attracted fans from the LGBT+ community, who found themselves to be able to identify with her boldness and expressivity. === 2012 - 2013: Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded and The Re-Up === Minaj released a single, \"Starships\", on Valentine's Day of 2012, before releasing her second studio album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, on April 3, 2012.

She was featured on David Guetta's single \"Turn Me On\", which reached the top ten worldwide. Minaj re- released Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded later in the year as Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up that contained songs like \"Va Va Voom\" and \"Freedom\". From 2012 to 2013, she was featured as a judge on the music competition series American Idol alongside Keith Urban, Mariah Carey, and Randy Jackson. === 2014 - 2017: The Other Woman, The Pinkprint, and other projects === In 2014, Minaj was featured in the film The Other Woman.
