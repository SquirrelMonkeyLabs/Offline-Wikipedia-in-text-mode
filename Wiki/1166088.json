 "text": "The Mavala is a Title used for the Kolis of Maval region. All of the inhabitants of Maval region were Mahadeo Kolis. Maval region, also known as Bavan Mavals (52 valley), was known as Koli country and each Mavals were under the control of Koli chief or Nayaks. The Koli community made a substantial contribution to the success of the Swarajya movement of Shivaji. The 'Koli Chauthara' in Shivneri fort still stands as a monument to the Kolis' love of independence. During the time of Maratha leader, Shivaji in 17th century, the Mavala title was exclusively used for people belonging to the peasant Kolis and Kunbi community of the region but Kunbis of Maval region were Kolis who were settled as Agriculturist and became Kunbi. Koli Mavalas were expert footmen and excelled in mountain warfare. Shivaji raised an infantry of Mavale who used guerilla tactics of hit and run to inflict heavy losses on numerically stronger enemies. The infantry was considered the backbone of his power, and according to Sabhasad Bakhar, which chronicled Shivaji's life, the Mavale and Hasham infantry of Shivaji had 100,000 men. Kolis who were known as the names of Mavala Sardars earned the Naikwadis. == References == Category:Koli titles",
