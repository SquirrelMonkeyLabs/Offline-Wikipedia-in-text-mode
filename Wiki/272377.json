 "text": "Power lines are wires that conduct electricity through to another place. Many have transformers. The original power is made at a power plant. The voltage of the power at the end is usually 100V (Japan), 120V (North and Central America, parts of South America and Africa, and Saudi Arabia), or 220-240V (most of the rest of the world). \"Step-up\" transformers increase the voltage in electric power distribution grids, and increase it greatly in long electric power transmission lines. The power at the end is \"stepped-down\" by another transformer so it can be distributed and used. Very long power lines carry high voltage DC. Alternating current (AC) from the power plant is stepped up to a high voltage and rectified to make it Direct Current. At the other end it goes through an inverter to make the electricity AC again, and stepped down. ==Related pages== * Electricity * Static electricity * Power line communication Category:Electricity",
