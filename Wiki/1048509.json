It was nominated for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 45th Grammy Awards but lost to Coldplay's \"In My Place\". Stapp said that he wrote the song about his problems with alcohol and drug addiction. He wrote that through his relapses, he had to accept that he couldn't stay sober. A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Ramaa Mosley. In the video, an old man feeds pigeons. There are flashbacks of a city flooding and the band playing on boats are shown. Stapp tries to help people, helping on man out of the water only to see that it is himself. Stapp saves a child and it's shown that both the child and the old man were him at different points of his life. WWE used the song in their Desire promotional videos in the early 2000s. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2001 songs Category:Creed (band) songs Category:Hard rock songs",
