Scientists have seen it as high as 1601 meters above sea level; it can live in forests, coastal areas and places that are a little dry. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is about 76 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be 90 mm long. It has a flat head and large eyes. The frogs can be different colors: green, brown, or light brown. It has patches of darker color. There is yellow and black color on the upper legs. The hind feet have a lot of webbing and the front feet have some webbing. The belly is light in color. The adult male frog has a dark throat and the adult female frog has a light throat. ==Life cycle== These frogs lay eggs after it rains, at any time of year. The males wait near temporary bodies of water and sing for the females. The females sometimes lay eggs in shallow limestone basins. The eggs sit on the top of the water in a film. The tadpoles are brown with a lighter stripe. ==Behavior== Adult Mexican tree frogs hide during the day in the shade or under tree bark. They look for food at night. They eat insects, spiders and other animals with no spines. People have seen Mexican tree frogs in the tops of palm trees. Both male and female frogs make a high sound when they see a animal that wants to eat them. The male frog makes a \"wonk wonk wonk\" sound when he sings for the female frog. This frog can make a cocoon. This frog sheds the skin cells on the very outside of its body. The cocoon stops water from leaving the frog's body. ==Threats== Snakes like to eat this frog. Scientists think this frog is good at living near humans, but there are some places where people have not seen the frog for a long time. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
