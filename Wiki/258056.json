 "text": "Iron(II) chloride, also known as ferrous chloride, is a chemical compound. It is made of iron and chloride ions. The iron is in its +2 oxidation state. ==Properties== It is grayish-white when anhydrous and greenish when hydrated. It is oxidized by oxygen to a mixture of iron(III) chloride and iron(III) oxide, which are brown-yellow. It dissolves in water to make a yellowish-green solution. It is a reducing agent. It reacts with bases to make greenish iron(II) hydroxide. ==Preparation== It is made by dissolving iron in hydrochloric acid. It can also be made by reacting iron with iron(III) chloride. Some other reducing agents react with iron(III) chloride to make iron(II) chloride. ==Uses== It does not have common uses. Iron(II) sulfate and iron(III) chloride are used more often. It is used in treating wastewater. It can be used as a reducing agent in organic chemistry. ==Related pages== *Iron(II) oxide *Iron(III) oxide *Cobalt(II) chloride *Copper(II) chloride Category:Iron compounds Category:Chloride salts",
