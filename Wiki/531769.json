 "text": "A physical disability is a condition that limits the way the body works. For example, a physical disability may limit the way a part of the body grows, moves, or does what it is supposed to do. ==Types of physical disabilities== ===Congenital disabilities=== A congenital disability is a disability that a baby has when they are born, or had before they were born. These disabilities used to be called \"birth defects.\" The most common congenital disability is congenital heart disease - problems in the way the heart grows and works. In 2013, 34.3 million people around the world had congenital heart disease. Congenital heart disease also causes more deaths than any other congenital disability. In 2013, it caused 323,000 deaths. Other examples of congenital disabilities include: * Fetal alcohol syndrome * Spina bifida, a problem with the way the spinal cord formed while a fetus was growing * Microcephaly, where the baby's head is smaller than usual * Problems with the way the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, or gastrointestinal system grew while a fetus was developing ====Inherited disabilities==== Some types of congenital disabilities are genetic. This means the disability was \"inherited,\" or passed down to a person, through their parents' genes. Examples of inherited physical disabilities include: * Cystic fibrosis * Sickle cell anaemia * Tay-Sachs disease * Huntington's disease * Hemophilia ===Acquired disabilities=== Acquired disabilities are disabilities that people get (\"acquire\") after they are born. Often they are caused by injuries or illnesses. Examples of acquired physical disabilities include: * Paralysis, caused by an injury to the spinal cord * Brain injury, caused by a head injury or an illness (like an infection in the brain) * Amputation of a body part because of injury or illness * Chronic back pain from on-the-job injuries * Chronic medical problems like epilepsy, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, and cancer ==Famous people with physical disabilities== There have been many famous people with physical disabilities.
