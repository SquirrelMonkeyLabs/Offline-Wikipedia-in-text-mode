 "text": "The Serapis flag was a flag designed by Dutch supporters of the American Revolutionary War. The flag's goal was to show that the Serapis was not a pirate ship and should not be captured and held by the Dutch government. The Serapis was designed in 1778 in England. John Paul Jones, a famous American naval hero, captured the ship in a famous sea battle in 1779. He used it to steal British resources and materials in coastal towns. Two years later, the ship was given to the French, who were America's allies in the Revolutionary War. It was then lost off the coast of Madagascar. == Related pages == * Flag * American Revolutionary War * British colonization of the Americas * British Empire Category:American Revolutionary War Category:Flags of the United States",
