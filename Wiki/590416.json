 "text": "The United Kingdom is divided by Royal Mail into postcode areas. The postcode area is the largest geographical unit used and forms the first characters of the alphanumeric UK postcode. ==Subdivision== Each postcode area is divided into post towns and postcode districts. The London post town is instead divided into several postcode areas.HMSO, The Inner London Letter Post, (1980) ==Scope== The single or pair of letters chosen for postcode areas are generally a mnemonic for the places served. ==United Kingdom postcode areas== Postcode area Postcode area name Code formation AB Aberdeen AL St Albans B Birmingham BA Bath BB Blackburn BD Bradford BH Bournemouth BL Bolton BN Brighton BR Bromley BS Bristol BT Belfast CA Carlisle CB Cambridge CF Cardiff CH Chester CM Chelmsford CO Colchester CR Croydon CT Canterbury CV Coventry CW Crewe DA Dartford DD Dundee DE Derby DG Dumfries Dumfries and Galloway DH Durham DL Darlington DN Doncaster DT Dorchester DY Dudley E East London EC East Central London EH Edinburgh EN Enfield EX Exeter FK Falkirk FY Blackpool The Fylde G Glasgow GL Gloucester GU Guildford HA Harrow HD Huddersfield HG Harrogate HP Hemel Hempstead HR Hereford HS Outer Hebrides First and last letters of Hebrides HU Hull HX Halifax IG Ilford Possibly Ilford and Chigwell, or Ilford and Barking IP Ipswich IV Inverness KA Kilmarnock KT Kingston upon Thames KW Kirkwall KY Kirkcaldy L Liverpool LA Lancaster LD Llandrindod Wells LE Leicester LL Llandudno LN Lincoln LS Leeds LU Luton M Manchester ME Rochester Medway (now sometimes known as Maidstone) MK Milton Keynes ML Motherwell N North London NE Newcastle upon Tyne NG Nottingham NN Northampton NP Newport NR Norwich NW North West London OL Oldham OX Oxford PA Paisley PE Peterborough PH Perth PL Plymouth PO Portsmouth PR Preston RG Reading RH Redhill RM Romford S Sheffield SA Swansea SE South East London SG Stevenage SK Stockport SL Slough SM Sutton Possibly Sutton and Morden, the two post towns that are within the SM area SN Swindon SO Southampton SP Salisbury Salisbury Plain SR Sunderland SS Southend-on-Sea ST Stoke-on-Trent SW South West London SY Shrewsbury TA Taunton TD Galashiels Tweeddale TF Telford TN Tunbridge Wells TQ Torquay TR Truro TS Cleveland Teesside TW Twickenham UB Southall Uxbridge W West London WA Warrington WC Western Central London WD Watford WF Wakefield WN Wigan WR Worcester WS Walsall WV Wolverhampton YO York ZE Lerwick Zetland ==Crown dependencies== The Crown dependencies (which are not part of the United Kingdom) did not introduce postcodes until later, but use a similar coding scheme. They are separate postal authorities. Postcode area Postcode area name GY Guernsey JE Jersey IM Isle of Man ==Defunct postcode areas== ===London NE and S=== ===Glasgow=== Glasgow, like London, was divided into compass districts: C, W, NW, N, E, SE, S, SW. When postcodes were introduced, these were mapped into the new G postcode: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. As NW and SE had never been subdivided they became G20 and G40 respectively. ===Norwich and Croydon=== Norwich and Croydon were used for a postcode experiment in the late 1960s, which was replaced by the current system. The format was of the form NOR or CRO followed by two numbers and a letter, e.g. NOR 07A. ==Non- geographic postcodes== ===GIR=== GIR 0AA is a postcode created for Girobank in Bootle. ===BF=== The BF postcode area was introduced in 2012 to provide optional postcodes for British Forces Post Office addresses, for consistency with the layout of other UK addresses. It uses the national non-geographic post town \"BFPO\" and, as of 2012, the postcode district \"BF1\". ===BX=== The non-geographic postcode area BX has been introduced for addresses which do not include a locality: this allows large organisations flexibility as to where they receive their mail. ==Overseas territories== Certain British overseas territories have postcodes: Postcode Location AI-2640 Anguilla\"Anguilla Has A Postal Code, AI-2640\", The Anguillian, 12 October 2007 ASCN 1ZZ STHL 1ZZ TDCU 1ZZ Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: Ascension Island Saint Helena Tristan da CunhaFirst postcode for remote UK isle.
