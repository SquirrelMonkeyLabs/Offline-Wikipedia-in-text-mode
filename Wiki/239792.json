 "text": "Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace is the eighth album by American punk rock band The Offspring, released in 2008. It was their first album of new material in nearly five years, following 2003's Splinter, and their first to be produced by Bob Rock. It had produced four singles: \"Hammerhead\", \"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\", \"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?\" and \"Half-Truism\". Although drummer Atom Willard (who left in July 2007) was still a member of the band during the recording, session musician Josh Freese actually handled the drum tracks, like he did on Splinter. Due to contract issues with Geffen Records, Willard could not do recording on the album and later decided to leave the band and continue his duties in Angels & Airwaves full time while former Face to Face drummer Pete Parada joined the band just in time for the tour.The Offspring have a new drummer , Offspring.com, 07-27-2007 ==Track listing== # \"Half-Truism\" – 3:26 # \"Trust in You\" – 3:09 # \"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\" – 2:58 # \"Hammerhead\" – 4:38 # \"A Lot Like Me\" – 4:28 # \"Takes Me Nowhere\" – 2:59 # \"Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?\" – 3:42 # \"Nothingtown\" – 3:29 # \"Stuff Is Messed Up\" – 3:32 # \"Fix You\" – 4:19 # \"Let's Hear It for Rock Bottom\" – 4:05 # \"Rise and Fall\" – 2:59 ==Personnel== ===The Offspring=== *Dexter Holland – lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Noodles – lead guitar, backing vocals *Greg K. – bass guitar, backing vocals ===Additional personnel=== *Josh Freese – drums *Chris \"X-13\" Higgins - backing vocals *Bob Rock – producer ==References== Category:2008 albums Category:The Offspring albums Category:Pop punk albums",
