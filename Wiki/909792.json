 "text": "Broken Arrow was a call for all available combat aircraft to attack enemy positions, even those close to the position of U.S. troops. The reason for calling in that order, is because a U.S. position is being overrun and can no longer be defended. Broken Arrow was a code phrase that a military unit on the ground is facing imminent (or very soon) destruction from enemy attack and all available air forces within range are to provide air support immediately. Broken Arrow is a code phrase that refers to an accidental event that involves nuclear weapons, warheads or components that does not create a risk of nuclear war. These include: * Accidental or unexplained nuclear explosion * Non- nuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon * Radioactive contamination * Loss in transit of nuclear asset with or without its carrying vehicle * Jettisoning of a nuclear weapon or nuclear component * Public hazard, actual or implied ==In modern culture== The phrase has been used in We Were Soldiers (2002). Its movie star is Mel Gibson. Part of the plot of the movie is that, at the point of being overrun by the enemy, the military officer (played by Mel Gibson), orders his forward air controller, to call in the air strike, by saying \"Broken Arrow\". ==Other websites== *Broken Arrow at Wiktionary.org ==Sources== Category:Military terminology",
