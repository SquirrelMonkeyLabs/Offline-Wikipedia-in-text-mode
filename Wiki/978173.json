 "text": "The \"Himno Nacional de Guatemala\" is the national anthem of Guatemala. ==Lyrics== Spanish original English translation I Happy Guatemala...! May your altars Never be profaned by the tormentor, Nor there be slaves who lick the yoke Nor tyrants who spit on your face. If tomorrow your sacred ground Is threatened by foreign invasion Free to the wind, your beautiful flag Will call to victory or death. Free to the wind, your beautiful flag Will call to victory or death; May your people with fierce spirit Be rather dead than a slave. II From your old and hard chains You forged with an angry hand The plough that fertilises the soil, And the sword that saves honour. Our fathers fought one day Burning with national ardour, And managed without bloody clash To place you on a throne of love. And managed without bloody clash To place you on a throne of love, Which from fatherland in energetic focus Gave life to the redemptive ideal. III Your ensign is a piece of heaven In which a cloud catches its whiteness And woe to he who with blind madness Intends to stain its colours! Because your brave and proud children, Who worship peace as a prize, Never dodge the rough fight If they defend their land and their home. Never dodge the rough fight If they defend their land and their home, May only honour be their venerable idea And the altar of the fatherland their altar. IV Lying on the superb Andes From two seas to the sonorous noise Under the wing of scarlet and gold You fall asleep to the beautiful quetzal. Indian bird that lives on your coat of arms, Palladium that protects your soil May it take its flight More than the condor and the golden eagle! May it take its flight More than the condor and the golden eagle, And on its wings lift up to the sky, Guatemala, your immortal name! ==References== Guat Category:National symbols of Guatemala",
