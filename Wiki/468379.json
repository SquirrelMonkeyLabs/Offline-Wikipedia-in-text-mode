 "text": "The ampersand (&), also referred to as the and sign, is a logogram (a diagram standing for a word). It represents the Latin conjunction et, which means and. The ampersand symbol is not only a logogram, but also a ligature. It joins the old handwritten Latin letters e and t of the word et, so that the word is represented as a single glyph.\"The ampersand & more\" with Kory Stamper, part of the \"Ask the Editor\" video series at Merriam-Webster.com With a c added on it means \"et cetera\", \"and so on\". In everyday writing, the ampersand is sometimes written like a reversed 3 with a vertical line through it.A Visual Guide to the Ampersand (Infographic) == References == Category:Typography Category:Symbols Category:Latin letters",
