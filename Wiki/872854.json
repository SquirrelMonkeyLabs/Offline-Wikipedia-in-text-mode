 "text": "Paddy fields are places in which semiaquatic plants, such as rice and taro can be grown. These fields are filled with shallow water at least part of the year. Growing these plants is very labor-intensive. A lot of water is needed. Paddy fields started next to the Yangtze River in China, in the Neolithic era. Later, their use spread to other areas in Asia. Paddy fields are built next to marshes or using terraces, on a hillside. Deepwater rice is not grown using paddy fields. It needs water over deep for at least a month.
