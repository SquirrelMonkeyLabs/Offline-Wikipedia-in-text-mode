Galatea or Neptune VI, is the fourth closest moon to Neptune. It is named after Galatea, one of the Nereids of Greek legend. Galatea was found in late July 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe. It was given the designation S/1989 N 4\\. The discovery was said (IAUC 4824) on August 2, 1989, but the text only talks of \"10 frames taken over 5 days\", giving a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991. It is not a sphere and shows no sign of any geological changes. ==Other websites== * Galatea Profile by NASA's Solar System Exploration Category:Neptune's moons",
