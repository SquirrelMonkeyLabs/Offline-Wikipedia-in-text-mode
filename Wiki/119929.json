 "text": "The Books of the Bible are the different sections of the Bible. Each book has a different name. Most books of the Bible are named after the person who is thought to have written the book. Some are not. Different religions, and different denominations of Christianity, have different lists of books of the Bible. These different groups accept different books. These groups also use different names for some of the same books. The stories in the \"Books of the Bible\" are very similar for all religious groups. Some people memorize the Bible or its individual books. Below, there is a list or table that compares the Books of the Bible in Judaism and in the Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Slavonic Orthodox, Georgian, Armenian Apostolic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Churches. The table covers both the Old Testament and the New Testament. For a detailed discussion of the differences, see \"Biblical canon\". The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic churches have small differences in the lists of books that they accept. If at least one Eastern church accepts a book, then that book is listed in this table. The Eastern churches accept all of the books that the Roman Catholic Church accepts. == Old Testament== If a table cell has an asterisk (*), it means that a book is used, but in a different order. Empty cells mean that the book is not used. These books are often called apocrypha. This word is sometimes used specifically (and possibly negatively) to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canon that are not in the Protestant Bible. Orthodox and Catholic Christians call these books deuterocanonical, which means second canon.

James Greek Jude Greek Revelation of Christ to John Revelation of Christ to John Revelation of Christ to John Revelation of Christ to John Greek The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has a few other books in its canon (list of books): Jubilees, Book of Enoch, and The Rest of the Words of Baruch (4 Baruch). The Peshitta does not have 2-3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation, but Bibles of the modern Syriac Orthodox Church do have later translations of those books. They also have the Letter of Baruch (Baruch, is called a deuterocanonical book of the Bible). Today the Syrian Orthodox Church only uses lessons from the twenty-two books of Peshitta in its official lectionary (list of Church readings). Third Epistle to the Corinthians was once part of the Armenian Orthodox Bible, but it is not in modern editions (printed versions). == Anglican Apocrypha == The Anglican Church accepts the same order of books as the Vulgate (Catholic 16th Century) Bible. The 39 Articles (an Anglican list of doctrines or important beliefs) says that these Books of the Bible are Apocrypha: :I. Esdras :II. Esdras :Tobit :Judith :The Rest of Esther :The Wisdom of Solomon :Ecclesiasticus (:) :Baruch, with the Letter of Jeremiah :The Song of the Three Jews, with the Prayer of Azariah :The Story of Susanna :Bel and the Dragon :The Prayer of Manasseh :I.
