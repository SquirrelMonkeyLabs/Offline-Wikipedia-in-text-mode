 "text": "\"L'Aube Nouvelle\" is the national anthem of Benin. In English, the name is \"The Dawn of a New Day\". It was written and composed by Gilbert Jean Dagnon. It was adopted when the Republic of Dahomey became independent from France in 1960. When Dahomey became Benin in 1975, the anthem was kept, with small changes to the words to fit the new name of the country. == Lyrics == === French original === French lyrics English translation Children of Benin, arise! The resounding cry of freedom Is heard at the first light of dawn, Children of Benin, arise! I Formerly, at her call, our ancestors Knew how to engage in mighty battles With strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood. Builders of present, you too, join forces Each day for the task stronger in unity. Build without ceasing for posterity. II When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate: Citizen of Benin be proud, and in a calm spirit Trusting in the future, behold your flag! In the green you read hope of spring; The red signifies the courage of your ancestors; The yellow foretells the greatest treasures. III Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pastures Show everywhere your brightness; Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits. Benin, from henceforth your sons are united With one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing you Enjoy abundance and happiness forever. === In local languages === Fon lyrics Yoruba lyrics == References == Category:1960 works Category:National symbols of Benin Category:African anthems",
