Real or semi- vegetarians, though, usually resent flexitarian, looking down on this term and calling it cheating. A pescetarian is a person who eats fish, shrimp and seafood. They do not eat poultry. A pollotarian is a person who eats chicken. They do not eat red meat, seafood or fish. Pollo-pescetarians eat seafood, shrimp and poultry but no red meat.
