 "text": "Hubal was a Saudi Arabian moon god worshipped by the Quraysh tribe in Makkah. The idol of the God was shaped similarly to a Human and the people of Makkah threw arrows at the idol so they could get favors out of the God. However in 630 AD, Muhammad destroyed all of the idols in Makkah including Hubal using a rod. The idol was seen as the greatest of the 360 idols by the Quraysh. He is also seen as a god of war and weather, specifically rain. == References == Category:Gods and goddesses Category:Islam",
