It tends to turn back into sulfur dioxide and water again. It is a weak reducing agent. Sulfurous acid has two tautomers, or chemical structures that easily change into each other. One is the form, and the other is a sulfonic acid, . The bisulfite ion, when sulfurous acid loses only one hydrogen atom, has the shape of the sulfonic acid tautomer. ==Related pages== *Sulfuric acid *Sulfate *Sulfur ==References== Category:Oxoacids Category:Sulfur compounds",
