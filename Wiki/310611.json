 "text": "In thermodynamics, the fugacity is a state function of any isothermal system. The fugacity, which has units of pressure, represents the tendency of a fluid to escape or expand isothermally. For gases at low pressures where the ideal gas law holds, fugacity is equal to pressure. The ratio \\phi = f/P \\, between fugacity f\\, and pressure P\\, is called the fugacity coefficient; therefore, \\phi = 1 \\, for an ideal gas. The fugacity f\\, is defined at fixed temperature T\\, by the following differential relation: : d \\ln f = {dG \\over RT} = {{V dP} \\over RT} \\, where G\\, is the Gibbs free energy, R\\, is the molar gas constant, and V\\, is the fluid's volume. For any two isothermal physical states, represented by subscripts 1 and 2, the ratio of the two fugacities is as follows: : f_2 / f_1 = exp \\left ({1 \\over RT} \\int_{G_1}^{G_2} dG \\right) = exp \\left ({1 \\over RT} \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} V\\,dP \\right) \\, Category:Thermodynamics",
