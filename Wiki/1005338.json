 "text": "The Azumi were a clan and tribe of warriors in Japan during the Jōmon period. They are known for their culture and beliefs, which are considered one of the earliest sea religions in Japan. They lived in Northern Kyūshū. They were active from the early 3rd century to the 7th century. They were great sailors. They had a big navy. They lived in an area called Chikuzen, which is now part of Fukuoka Prefecture. The Azumi people used their knowledge of tidal changes, weather patterns, and constellations to explore and navigate the sea successfully. They followed the sea god, Watatsumi, and a powerful deity named Isora, who provided them with spiritual guidance in their daily lives. == Shikaumi Jinja == Shikaumi Shrine is their ancestral shrine. The shrine is taken care of by a priest who is believed to be a descendant of the Azumi clan. The biennial gojinkosai ceremony held at the shrine is recognized as an intangible cultural property by the prefecture. The shrine includes a deer motif in its rituals and designs. The deer motif is significant to the Azumi people and their beliefs. It is a common feature in the historic culture of the region. == References == Category:Japanese people Category:History of Japan",
