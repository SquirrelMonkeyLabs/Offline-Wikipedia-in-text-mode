 "text": "The Lamborghini LM001 is an off-road vehicle made by Lamborghini in 1981. It was first revealed at the 1981 Geneva Auto Show along with the new-at-the-time Lamborghini Jalpa. The LM001 was made for military use, but only one prototype was ever made. This was because the rear-engine design made the car handle poorly. ==History== Even though the previously made Lamborghini Cheetah was a failure, Lamborghini still wanted to make an off-road military vehicle. The Cheetah concept was redesigned into the LM001. Unlike the Cheetah's Chrysler engine, the LM001 prototype had a 134 kW 5.9-litre AMC-built V8. The V12 from the Countach was supposed to be used for production models. ==References== LM001",
