Vocalist Chester Bennington said that he wrote the song about his battle with drug addiction, saying that \"Crawling is about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol, hence the line \"These wounds they will not heal...\" He also said that the song is one of the hardest for him to sing live. A music video for the song was released. In the video, a woman in an abusive relationship looks in a mirror at the bruises on her body as blood drips into the sink. The man enters the bathroom and it cut to the band playing while surrounded by crystals. The woman has her hands over her head and is scared. Different scenes of her life are shown. A woman looks at her worried and she cries alone in the shower. At the end, she smiles and touches her reflection in the mirror. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2000 songs Category:Linkin Park songs Category:Grammy Award-winning songs Category:Songs about drugs",
