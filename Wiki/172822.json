The member countries were the United Kingdom, Austria, Russia, France (from 1815), Prussia (Germany from 1871) and Italy (from 1871). It started as a quadruple alliance. After Napoleon, ruler of France, was no longer in power, France joined the Concert of Europe. Its importance diminished with the revolutions of 1848 and subsequent wars between the big powers.
