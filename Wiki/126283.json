The treaty was signed in the city of Amritsar. As part of the treaty land was given to Maharaja Gulab Singh Dogra. Gulab Singh was then able to rule over the lands to the west of the Ravi River including Chamba. Gulab Singh paid money to the British Government to get this land. The Treaty of Amritsar marked the beginning of Dogra rule in Kashmir, which was to end in 1948 after India got independence from Britishers. ==Related pages== *Treaty of Lahore Category:19th century in India Amritsar Category:1846",
