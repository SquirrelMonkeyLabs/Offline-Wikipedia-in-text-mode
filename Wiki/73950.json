The plane could carry four AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles and four long range AIM-7 Sparrow missiles, but it did not have a gun. Later, the E model had a cannon mounted on it. After the F-15 Eagle replaced it, it was used as a bomber and the G model was used as a Wild Weasel. It is currently used by countries such as Turkey and Iran. ==Related pages== *F-8 Crusader *F-15 Eagle Category:United States Air Force aircraft Category:United States Navy aircraft Category:United States Marine Corps aircraft Category:Vietnam War aircraft",
