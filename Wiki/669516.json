Betty Boop was described in a 1934 court case as: \"combin[ing] in appearance the childish with the sophisticatedâ€”a large round baby face with big eyes and a nose like a button, framed in a somewhat careful coiffure, with a very small body of which perhaps the leading characteristic is the most self-confident little bust imaginable\". She was first voiced by Margie Hines, but was popularly played by Mae Questel. ==References== Category:Fictional American people",
