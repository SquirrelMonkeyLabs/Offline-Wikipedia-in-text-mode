 "text": "The North East MRT Line (NEL) is the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour.Travel Time, SBS Transit This line is coloured purple in the rail map. The line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations. This line is the first MRT line in Singapore to be completely underground (running in a tunnel all the way between HarbourFront and Punggol). It is also the first (and so far, the only) line where trains get their power from overhead wires above the track, instead of a third rail beside the track. All the trains on the North East Line are automated (computer-controlled) and do not have an operator driving the train at the front. It is one of the world's first rapid transit lines that does not need drivers and is one of three such lines in the MRT network today. The others are the Circle Line and the Downtown Line. ==Stations== Station number Station name Image Interchange/notes HarbourFront Interchange with the reserved; under planning Reserve station to be open at a later date Outram Park Interchange with the and the (2021) Chinatown Interchange with the Clarke Quay Dhoby Ghaut Interchange with the and the Little India Interchange with the Farrer Park Boon Keng Potong Pasir Woodleigh Serangoon Interchange with the Kovan Hougang Interchange with the (2029) Buangkok Sengkang Interchange with the Punggol Interchange with the North East line extension (under construction, to be ready by 2024) Punggol Coast The Land Transport Authority has announced that it will extend the North East Line from its current northern terminal at Punggol to a new station called Punggol Coast.
