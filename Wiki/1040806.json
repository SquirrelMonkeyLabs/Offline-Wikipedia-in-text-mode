 "text": "U-Pick Live is a defunct programming block that aired on Nickelodeon on October 14, 2002 to May 27, 2005 on weekday afternoons. The show allowed viewers to pick via internet voting the Nickelodeon shows (usually cartoons) that would air on the block. the host of the show also took part in sketches and gags, often including members from their studio audience and celebrity guests. == Cast and Hosts == Brent Popolizio is one of the main hosts for UPL. He wears glasses and has his own UPL segment called “ Ten Seconds with Brent. “ He is known for being tortured by everyone in UPL ( Mostly Candace. ) along with Brent, Candace Bailey is also one of the hosts for UPL. She is the only woman who works for UPL. She has her own segment on UPL called “ Candace’s Corner “ which sometimes gets interrupted by Brent, Antonio or Pick Boy. After UPL’s cancellation, Bailey worked on G4’s Attack of the Show from 2012 until 2013. Jeff Sutphen plays Pick Boy, a “ superhero “ that picks people from the audience. Pick Boy is egotistic yet a bit naïve. Pick Boy became a target for many polls at Nick.com such as “What kind of hairstyle should Pick Boy Have?”. == Activities and Sketches == The Prize Wall - a wall of 14 and 5/8 doors that are filled with prizes and in one of those doors they get the Bucket O’ Bucks, which is just money in a bucket. When UPL’s studio repudiated, The Prize Wall was redesigned as a punching wall and the last 5 numbers were removed from 14 to 9 and a new bucket thing was added and was called “ The Bucket of Yuck “ when the person would do gross things the bucket tell them to do. Candace’s Corner - Candace would talk about stuff ( like Cellphones, etc ). But sometimes it gets interrupted by Brent, Antonio or Pick Boy. It was removed from the UPL schedule in 2004 when UPL reupdated it’s format. Daily Challenge ( 2002 - 2004 ) - Voters at Nick.com would vote for what the daily challenge is, Category:American television series",
