He played parts of 13 years in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Vancouver Canucks and Anaheim Ducks. He is a co-host of Hockey Night in Canada. After playing junior hockey in Ontario, Bieksa was awarded a scholarship to Bowling Green University, where he spent four years. While at university, Bieksa was selected by the Canucks in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, and joined their minor league partner, the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League (AHL), after graduating. After spending time with the Moose, he joined the Canucks. A physical defenceman, Bieksa has increased his scoring totals in each of the full seasons he has played in the NHL. During his time with the Canucks, Bieksa would help them reach the Stanley Cup Finals but they would lose 4 games to three to the Boston Bruins. On June 27, 2011, Bieksa would sign a five-year, $23 million contract extension with the team. On June 30, 2015, the Canucks traded Bieksa to the Anaheim Ducks for a second round pick in the 2016 draft. He would sign a two-year, $8,000,000 contract extension two days later. On October 13, 2022, Bieksa would sign a one-day contract with the Canucks and would retire. After retiring, Bieksa became a analyst for Hockey Night in Canada. His work has earned him a nomination for Best Sports Analyst at the Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, 2022, and 2024. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1997–98 Burlington Cougars OPJHL 27 0 3 3 10 — — — — — 1998–99 Burlington Cougars OPJHL 48 8 29 37 83 — — — — — 1999–00 Burlington Cougars OPJHL 49 6 27 33 139 — — — — — 2000–01 Bowling Green State University CCHA 35 4 9 13 90 — — — — — 2001–02 Bowling Green State University CCHA 40 5 10 15 68 — — — — — 2002–03 Bowling Green State University CCHA 34 8 17 25 92 — — — — — 2003–04 Bowling Green State University CCHA 38 7 15 22 66 — — — — — 2003–04 Manitoba Moose AHL 4 0 2 2 2 — — — — — 2004–05 Manitoba Moose AHL 80 12 27 39 192 14 1 1 2 35 2005–06 Manitoba Moose AHL 23 3 17 20 71 13 0 10 10 38 2005–06 Vancouver Canucks NHL 39 0 6 6 77 — — — — — 2006–07 Vancouver Canucks NHL 81 12 30 42 134 9 0 0 0 20 2007–08 Manitoba Moose AHL 1 0 1 1 2 — — — — — 2007–08 Vancouver Canucks NHL 34 2 10 12 90 — — — — — 2008–09 Vancouver Canucks NHL 72 11 32 43 97 10 0 5 5 14 2009–10 Vancouver Canucks NHL 55 3 19 22 85 12 3 5 8 14 2010-11 Vancouver Canucks NHL 66 6 16 22 73 17 4 4 8 35 2011–12 Vancouver Canucks NHL 78 8 36 44 94 5 1 0 1 6 2012–13 Vancouver Canucks NHL 36 6 6 12 48 4 1 0 1 8 2013–14 Vancouver Canucks NHL 76 4 20 24 104 — — — — — 2014–15 Vancouver Canucks NHL 60 4 10 14 77 6 0 0 0 9 2015–16 Anaheim Ducks NHL 71 4 11 15 99 6 0 1 1 2 2016–17 Anaheim Ducks NHL 81 3 11 14 63 8 0 4 4 23 2017–18 Anaheim Ducks NHL 59 0 8 8 83 1 0 0 0 0 OPJHL totals 127 14 59 73 238 - - - - - CCHA totals 147 24 51 75 316 - - - - - AHL totals 108 15 47 62 267 27 1 11 12 73 NHL totals 808 63 215 278 1124 86 10 20 30 147 ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Anaheim Ducks players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Manitoba Moose players Category:Vancouver Canucks players",
