 "text": "Dahl's aquatic frog, the northern waterfrog, Dahl's olive tree frog, Dahl's tree frog, floodplain frog, northern lagoon frog or aquatic frog (Ranoidea dahlii) is a tree frog from Australia and New Guinea. Most of them live in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. There are a few more in Queensland and New Guinea. This frog lives near bodies of water that either take months to dry up or do not dry up at all. During the day, it sits next to the water. When the weather is dry, it finds a crack in the ground to hide in. Scientists do not know what the eggs or tadpoles are like. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
