The southern peak of the mountain was climbed for the first time in 1971. The climbers that climbed it were G. Lee, R. Wood, P. Clanky, J. Pavur, Y. Kamisawa and P. Koch. Since the peaks have been climbed for the first time, there are now more than 13 routes going up the mountain. Most of these routes are very difficult and challenging.
