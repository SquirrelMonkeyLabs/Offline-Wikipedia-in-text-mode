 "text": "The National Secondary School Academic Competition (hungarian: Országos Középiskolai Tanulmányi Verseny, OKTV) in Hungary is a well-known high-level contest for students aged 15-18 (grades 9-12). They compete in subjects like sciences, IT, math, history, philosophy, Hungarian literature, and foreign languages. Winners often go on to represent Hungary in International Student Olympiads, where they might win gold medals or be named Overall Winners. Top competitors get extra points for university admission, but since the total extra points are limited to 100 and can be gained through less competitive methods, this doesn't give much advantage to the best students in admissions. == History == The first National Secondary School Academic Competition was held in 1923 for mathematics, with physics and natural sciences competitions starting in 1927. From 1952 to 1956, during the communist regime, the competition was named the Mátyás Rákosi Academic Competition. == OKTV Competitions == * OKTV English language * OKTV Biology * OKTV Internal Affairs Law Enforcement Knowledge * OKTV Philosophy * OKTV Physics * OKTV Geography * OKTV French language * OKTV Digital Culture, Application Category * OKTV Digital Culture, Programming Category * OKTV Chemistry * OKTV Latin language * OKTV Hungarian literature * OKTV Hungarian Grammar * OKTV Mathematics * OKTV Motion Picture Culture and Media Knowledge * OKTV Art History * OKTV German language * OKTV Italian language * OKTV Russian language * OKTV Drawing and Visual Culture * OKTV Spanish language * OKTV Slovak Language and Literature * OKTV History Category:Education in Hungary",
