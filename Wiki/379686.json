 "text": "Pascal's law is a law about the physics of a fluid. It says that if pressure is exerted on a non compressible fluid in an enclosed vessel, this pressure will be distributed evenly throughout the fluid. It is named after Blaise Pascal who discovered it in 1647. An example of Pascal's law is the way a fluid flows out of one syringe to another through a pipe or tube.
