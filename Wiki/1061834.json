She gained attention by posting tweets as AngryArabiya during the protests. She also advocates for her father Abdulhadi Alkhawaja's release who constantly does hunger strike. She has also criticized the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama for \"standing behind the dictator\". ==Prison== She was designated a Prisoner of Conscience by Amnesty International. She had faced a three-year prison sentence for tearing up a picture of King Hamad in December 2014, a notable act of protest. ==Forced exile== Despite release, ongoing charges kept her under the threat of re- arrest as several Bahraini officials told Danish authorities that if she doesn't leave the country she will be separated from her child and will be put in prison again. For that reason she left Bahrain and went to Denmark. She announced her exile on X formerly Twitter. Now, Zainab with Danish-Bahraini dual citizenship, continues her activism from abroad. ==Related pages== * Human rights in Bahrain *Ayat Al-Qurmezi *Hasan Mushaima ==References== Category:Bahraini activists Category:Living people Category:1983 births",
