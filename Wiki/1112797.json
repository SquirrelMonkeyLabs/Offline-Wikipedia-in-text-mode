 "text": "The Avtomat Fedorov was a Russian automatic rifle. It was designed by Vladimir Grigoryevich Fedorov in 1915. Around 3,200 of these rifles were produced. It was used in World War I, the Russian Civil War and the Winter War. It used the 6.5 Ã— 50 mm Arisaka ammunition (of Japanese origin, due to the shortage of Russian ammunition at the time), a removable magazine with capacity for 25 cartridges, and could fire both automatically and semi-automatically (selective fire). Its rate of fire was 350-400 rounds per minute. The Avtomat Fedorov was one of the first rifles to offer effective automatic fire, giving it a huge advantage in combat. Despite its short lifespan, the Avtomat Fedorov paved the way for the development of future assault rifles such as the AK-47. Some claim that this weapon is the first assault rifle, but others say it is the STG-44 (of German origin) Category:Automatic rifles",
