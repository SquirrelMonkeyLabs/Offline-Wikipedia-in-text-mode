 "text": "A craniotomy is a surgical operation in which a bone flap is removed for a short time from the skull to get access to the brain. This is often done on patients who are suffering from brain lesions, such as tumors, blood clots, bullets, or have traumatic brain injury. It could also be done as part of a treatment for Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and tremors. This surgery could also cause infections. ==References== Category:Surgery",
