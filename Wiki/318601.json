 "text": "The indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) is a small seed-eating bird. It is migratory. Its range is from southern Canada to northern Florida during the breeding season, and from southern Florida to northern South America during the winter. It often migrates by night, using the stars to navigate. Its habitat is farmland, brush areas, and open woodland. The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting. The indigo bunting is a small bird, with a length of 11.5-13 cm (4.5â€“5 in). The male is a vibrant blue in the summer and a brown color during the winter months, while the female is brown year-round. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate. Nest-building and incubation are done solely by the female. The diet of the indigo bunting is insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter months. Category:Passeri Category:Birds of North America Category:Birds of South America",
