 "text": "The inauguration of Warren G. Harding as the 29th president of the United States happened on March 4, 1921. It was the start of the only term of Warren G. Harding as president and the only term of Calvin Coolidge as vice president. A public ceremony happened on the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 34th presidential inauguration. This was the first inauguration in which an automobile was used to transport the president-elect and the leaving president (Woodrow Wilson) to and from the Capitol. However, Wilson did not attend the ceremony himself because of a stroke he got two years before. Chief Justice Edward D. White administered the oath of office to Harding. Thomas R. Marshall administered the vice presidential oath of office to Coolidge. Harding did not finish his term as president, as he died on August 2, 1923. Calvin Coolidge then became the next president. ==References== ==Other websites== *Text of Harding's Inaugural Address Category:1920s in the United States Category:Warren G.
