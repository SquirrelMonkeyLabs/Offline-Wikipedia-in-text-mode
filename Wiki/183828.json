 "text": "The interwar period was a time in history from 9 November 1918 to 1 September 1939, between the two world wars, World War I and World War II. The period began with many changes internationally. The League of Nations was created, which was made to bring peace to the world, but did not prevent problems with Nazi Germany, which soon left the League. Also occurred was the growing threat of Japan, which invaded China. Soon the Soviet Union and Italy had begun to rise as international powers. All of that happened in the 21 years and soon triggered World War II. ==Related pages== * League of Nations * Russian Civil War * Chinese Civil War * Spanish Civil War * Second Sino-Japanese War == References == * McDonough, Frank (1997).
