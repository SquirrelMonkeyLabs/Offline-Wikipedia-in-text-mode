 "text": "\"Microshaft Winblows 98\" is a 1998 interactive comedy video game developed by Parroty Interactive and released by Palladium Interactive. It parodies Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system, co-founder Bill Gates, and the company's market dominance during the controversial United States v. Microsoft Corp. case. The game features a satirical storyline where players start as tech support workers and aim to meet Gates, alongside humorous minigames and spoofs of popular software like Internet Explorer and games like Doom. Released at a time when Microsoft was a frequent target of public jokes, the game tapped into the public's fascination with the company. It mimicked Windows 98's aesthetics and included clever parodies like \"Billagotchi,\" a Gates-themed Tamagotchi. Despite challenges during promotion, including being expelled from COMDEX, it gained attention at the Macworld expo. Critics praised its edgy, clever humor, comparing it to Mad magazine or Monty Python. However, some reviewers found its comedy cruel or lacking depth. Its innovative satire cemented its place as a distinctive parody of 1990s tech culture.",
