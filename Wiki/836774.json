His nickname is Ya-san (ヤッさん), Mister Ya in English. == Career == Yasuda grew up in the Eharacho area (Nakano City, Tokyo) in 1932. His father was from the Saga Prefecture and a right wing activist, but he soon started the fur and leather business. He moved to Kawasaki shortly after Yasuda was born and was evacuated when he was in the sixth grade from the Takatsu Elementary School. Yasuda then moved to Atsugi (also known as Kakio, Kawasaki City), where his mother's parents' home lived and failed his grades when he was in the first year of the old Atsugi High School. Aspiring to become a soldier, Yasuda applied to the Army Nursery School, but due to his fail grades, he changed his career to the path of music and learned to use the cornet by himself. While attending the new year at the Atsugi High School, Yasuda founded the brass band club, was in charge of the alto saxophone, and served as the principal. During his first year of high school, he was planning on attending the University of Tokyo or the Hitotsubashi University, but when Yasuda was in his third year of high school, he became interested in music and in 1951, he went to the Department of Instruments at the Tokyo University of the Arts. However, Yasuda was not used to the feudal nature of the classical music world, and due to financial difficulties to keep paying a large monthly fee, he started a part-time job as a jazzman at an expeditionary force club. Finally, when the Instrumentation Department was established at the Tokyo University of the Arts, it was moved there and completed in 1953. Since then, Yasuda has been active as a jazzman in Yokohama, Yokosuka, and Ueno. Yasuda later meets both Êtarô Ishibashi and Kei Tani during his trip to Yokohama. In 1953, he formed his own jazz band \"The Four Devers\" with Masahiro Ishida (saxophone), Yukio Tanizaki (bass), and Tetsuo Hino (drums) and performed in both Tokyo and Nagoya. At this time, Yasuda performed with Ishibashi's band. Later, after working in \"The Five\" where Ishibashi is the leader, Yasuda's first apperence was in the Nagoya club \"Fernando\" as a member of \"Happy Furinance\". The Peanuts (Emi Itō & Yumi Itō) also appeared in this club. From this time on, his name often appeared in the \"Swing Journal\" advertisement. In the fall of 1957, he joined Hajime Hana and The Crazy Cats with the performance of Êtarô Ishibashi. Yasuda was in charge of the tenor saxophone (occasionally a clarinet) as a successor to Masahiro Ishida, who was suffering from drug overdose and retired to see a psychiatrist. With a serious personality, he was the only member to appear in \"Adult Manga\" 1,835 times. Also, in \"Shabontama Holiday\", he was known for his role as \"Deputy Director of the Kintoto Movie Studio\", a contender who teamed up with Osami Nabe, and kept yelling \"Yasuda!\" In the end. He also plays the role of reversing his position. Also, the method of playing the saxophone while making the bridge is also famous, and it is shown on stage and in some Crazy Movies. Due to his serious personality, Yasuda was concerned about his lack of talent, and one of the people involved (including songwriter Yukio Aoshima) even said, \"Shin Yasuda is a crazy baggage.\" He seriously thought about retiring once, but a friend said, \"You're like the University of Tokyo at six baseball colleges.\" It's luggage that Yasuda just lost, but he hopes to do something someday, so it's interesting for all six universities.\" He is also an actor and appeared in many movies and television programs. However, since Yasuda participated in Crazy Cats band as a music expert, he did not intend to act as an actor originally, but when he appeared on a stage play, \"Fiddling on the Roof\" and \"The Fun\", he realized that he started to study on a large scale. Yasuda is also as a songwriter, and he composed many songs like \"Weekly Crazy\" theme song, drama theme songs, drama and company songs, group songs, and gymnastics accompaniment. Later, he formed the band \"Coelacanth\" with Kenichiro Morioka and Hiroshi Minami, and released songs like \"If Tanuki Was In The World\". He also co-starred with Kei Tani's band called \"The Supermarket.\" In his personal life, he married beauty researcher Miyoko Takekoshi in 1966. Known to his loving wife, a joke called \"Miyoko\" was born. However, he was not blessed with a childhood treasure, and in his later years, Yasuda himself was forced to fight his liver cancer and underwent surgery but managed to keep up with it to the end.
