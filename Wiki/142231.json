 "text": "The Mongolic languages are a group of languages that are spoken in East Asia and parts of Siberia. Some linguists propose to put Mongolic languages in the same group as the Turkic and Tungusic languages. They call this group the Altaic languages, but not all linguists agreed on this proposed classification. The best-known member of this language family is Mongolian. In Cyrillic orthography as it is used in Mongolia it is written Монгол Хэл. In the vertical Uygur-derived script as used in Inner Mongolia in China it is written Mongγol Kele. It is the primary language of most of the residents of Mongolia, and is spoken by around 5.7 million people in Mongolia, Russia, and China. ==References== * Γarudi (2002): Dumdadu üy-e-yin mongγul kelen-ü bütüče-yin kelberi-yin sudulul [The study of grammatical forms in Middle Mongolian].
