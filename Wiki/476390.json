 "text": "Herding is the act of bringing individual animals together into a group (herd). It is maintaining the group and moving the group from place to place. Many thousands of years ago herding became a way of life for many nomadic people. Today it is still a necessity for farmers, ranchers and those who raise domestic animals. == Herds == Some animals instinctively gather together as a herd. A group of animals fleeing a predator will herd together for protection. Some predators, such as wolves and dogs, have instinctive herding abilities that come from primitive hunting instincts. But there can be a fine line between chasing and herding.Mary Ann Albright. \"Herding skills unleashed.\" The Columbian (Vancouver, WA). McClatchy-Tribune Information Services. 2011. HighBeam Research. 10 Jan. 2015 > Dogs that show basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding and stock dog trials. It is a sport that dogs and their owners can enjoy together. Herding is used in agriculture to manage domesticated animals. Herding can be performed by people or dogs trained to control the movement of livestock under the direction of a person.William Haviland, et al., Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, 2011), pp. 166â€“168 Animals such as cattle, sheep and goats are commonly herded by humans and dogs. Also herd dogs may be used to gather and herd turkey, geese, ducks and chickens.Mary Ann Hoffman, Herding Dogs (New York: Gareth Stevens Publishing, 2011), p. 5 == Herd dogs == Originally dogs were used to both herd and guard domestic animals.Livestock Handling and Transport, ed. Temple Grandin (Wallingford: CABI, 2007), p. 200 Over time dogs were bred to specialize in one or the other. Herd guardians or guard dogs became the 24-hour protector of the flock. Herd dogs were developed to keep the herd together. Herding dogs are critical to Australian and British sheep farms. === Herd dog breeds === Herding dog breeds are typically intelligent, all-work and full of energy. * Australian Kelpie is a highly intelligent herding breed that can work with little or no guidance.
