 "text": "Allegro is a tempo marking for classical music. It says that the music is to be played moderately fast. At first, it was also used to describe the character of a piece, but since the 18th century, it is mainly used for the speed. It is faster than Andante, but slower than Presto. Sometimes, the term is translated: Composers such as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel used the word vite, Gustav Mahler wrote Rasch, and Benjamin Britten wrote Quickly. Most people say that piece that is played allegro should generally be played at speeds of between 120 and 168 beats per minute. Sometimes Allegro is used in the title of musical pieces, for example the Allegro barbaro by Bela Bartok. == Examples == *Eine kleine Nachtmusik, 1st Movement: Allegro, W.A.Mozart - *Symphony No 40 g minor, 1st movement: Molto allegro, W.A.Mozart *5th Symphony, 3rd movement: Allegro, Ludwig van Beethoven - *Étude Op. 25, No. 6, Frédéric Chopin – == References == Category:Music theory",
