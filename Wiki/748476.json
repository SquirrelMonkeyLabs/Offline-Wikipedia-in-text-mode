She calls them jerks because they bought sixteen candles instead of seventeen, her age. She sees that her birthday party has games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Peter dresses up as a clown named \"Pee Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown\" He shows Meg scarves coming out of his mouth, but he accidentally swallowed some of them and vomits. He also vomits a pair of long johns. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, but Lois sees Stewie opening them. Peter gets drunk and tries to ride a unicycle down the stairs but falls off and crushes his father, Francis Griffin. Francis dies in the hospital and calls Peter \"a fat stinking drunk\" as his last words. Peter is sad that his father did not like him, so he stops drinking and starts doing crack. Brian tells Peter that doing crack is just as bad as drinking. Peter goes to a hypnotist and learns that Francis was not his biological father. Peter asks his mom, Themla Griffin, and she reveals she had an affair with an Irish man named Mickey McFinnigan and that Mickey is Peter's biological father. Brian and Peter travel to a village in Ireland to find Mickey and learn that he is the town drunk. Being a town drunk is thought to be an honorable position by the people in Ireland. When Peter finds Mickey, Mickey does not believe that Peter is his son. Peter goes outside and sees the ghosts of Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Francis and Hayden Christensen. Francis calls him \"a fat stinking drunk\" again and gives Peter an idea. Peter challenges Mickey to a drinking contest. Peter wins the contest and Mickey is surprised. He now then believes that Peter is his son because no one but a member of his family could beat him in a drinking contest. Brian says that Francis may not have been Peter's biological father, but he raised him like his own son, Francis did love Peter. Peter accepts this, but still wants to have Mickey as a biological father. Peter, Mickey, and an Irish crowd start singing and dancing to a song called \"Drunken Irish Dad.\" === Subplot === Lois sees Stewie opening Meg's presents and figures out he is going through a \"mine\" phase. She later finds Stewie with her jewelry. When she tells Stewie to stop messing with her jewelry, he snaps a pearl necklace of hers. Lois spanks Stewie, causing Stewie to run off and cry. However, he starts to enjoy the thought of being hit, so he causes trouble around the house. Lois does not want to hit him again and Stewie stops when he learns he hears himself begging too much. == Feedback == A reviewer on Boxxet said \"when I checked the schedule and saw the title of this episode was 'Peter's Two Dads,' I was a little torn.\" He also says that the episode \"left me with something of a mixed reaction.\" and called the episode \"well constructed.\" Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy, said that this episode was one of his favorites, along with \"PTV\" and \"Road to Rhode Island.\" == References == Category:2007 television episodes Category:2007 in American television Category:Family Guy (season 5) episodes Category:Television episodes about birthdays",
