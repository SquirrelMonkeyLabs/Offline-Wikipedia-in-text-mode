Gowa Regency was hard-hit having the majority of the fatalities. The most destructive flood was caused by the overflowing of the Jeneberang River and the opening of the watergates of the Bili-Bili Dam in Gowa, though other floods also occurred elsewhere in the province. ==References== Category:2019 disasters in Asia Category:2010s floods Category:2010s in Indonesia Category:Disasters in Indonesia Category:Floods in Asia Category:History of Sulawesi Category:January 2019 events Category:South Sulawesi",
