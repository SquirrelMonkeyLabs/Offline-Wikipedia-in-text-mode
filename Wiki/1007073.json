 "text": "The Crinan Canal between Crinan and Ardrishaig in Argyll and Bute is operated by Scottish Canals. It opened in 1801 and is about nine miles (14 km) long. It connects the village of Ardrishaig on Loch Gilp with the Sound of Jura. This makes a short cut between the River Clyde and the Inner Hebrides, avoiding the Mull of Kintyre. Queen Victoria travelled along the canal to Crinan during a holiday in the Scottish Highlands in 1847. She was greeted at Ardrishaig and her boat was towed by four horses, two of which were ridden by servants in royal livery. At Crinan she boarded the royal yacht Victoria and Albert. Her journey made the canal a tourist attraction. ==References== Category:Canals in Scotland",
