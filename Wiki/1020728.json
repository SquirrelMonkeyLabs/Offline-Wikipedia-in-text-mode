 "text": "The Hainan small tree frog (Romerus hainanus) is a frog. It lives in China in Hainan Province. Scientists first saw it 710 meters above sea level on Mount Diaoluo. ==Home== People have seen this frog between 660 and 760 meters above sea level in places with trees and lower woody plants. This frog lives in places where the plants grow close together near streams. It can live in places that human beings have changed so long as the water is good. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Diaoluoshan Nature Reserve, Jianfengling Nature Reserve, Jiaxi Nature Reserve, Yingelling Nature Reserve, Exiangling Nature Reserve, and Bawangling Nature Reserve. ==Young== Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole because that is what other frogs in Romerus do. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms, for example small rubber, banana, and areca farms farms. Bad chemicals can also hurt this frog. People also go into the forest to take wood, and scientists think this could hurt the frog too. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
