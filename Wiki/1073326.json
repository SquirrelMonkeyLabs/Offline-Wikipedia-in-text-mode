At 10:00 am, less than five hours after Hamas attacked, fighting was reported outside of the Re'im Army Base, which is headquarters for the Gaza Division. According to one report, all of the Israeli soldiers at the base were 'killed or captured'. The base was reportedly the location of IDF drone and surveillance operations. Hamas reportedly posted a video of dead Israeli soldiers it had killed at the base. Later in the day, Israeli Defense Forces regained control of the military base. == Related pages == *Re'im music festival massacre, a massacre that took place during the battle ==References== Category:21st-century battles Category:Israel–Hamas war",
