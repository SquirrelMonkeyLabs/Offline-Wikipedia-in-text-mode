 "text": "Ostreidae are the true oysters. The family includes most species eaten under the name oyster. Pearl oysters are not true oysters because they belong to a different order, the Pterioida. Like scallops, true oysters have a central adductor muscle. This causes a scar in the middle of the shell. It is the point of attachment. The shell is often irregular because oysters attach to substrates. ==Other websites== Category:Bivalves",
