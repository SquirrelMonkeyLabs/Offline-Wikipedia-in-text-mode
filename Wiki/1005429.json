These animals are also known as kami no tsukai or tsukawashime. In ancient texts such as Kojiki and Nihongi, there are tales of special animals that acted on behalf of the kami to transmit the divine will or to bear oracles. As time passed, people started to connect certain animals with specific shrines. It became a custom to take care of these animals when they were found within the area of the shrine. Normally, each kami had only one animal familiar, but sometimes, there were some exceptions where a kami had more than one. Even some of the \"Seven Lucky Gods\" like Daikokuten (a mouse) and Benzaiten (a snake) had animal familiars. In later years, the kami's animal familiar became a common symbol of the kami itself. For instance, the fox at Inari shrines was worshipped as a manifestation of the kami. These creatures were thought to be extraordinary spiritual beings, and this perception, combined with their relationship with the specific kami, likely gave rise to this phenomenon. It is believed to have originated from shamanism, where animals aided shamans in traveling to the spirit world. Certain animals are associated with particular spirits, such as foxes with Inari and deer with Kasuga. In the past, tribal communities considered their shaman's animal helper as an ancestor, and this may have influenced the connection between animals and spirits in Shinto. For example, the Kamo tribe believed that the was their ancestor. At Ise Jingu, roosters roam around and are believed to be the assistants of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. They wake her up every morning, according to folklore. Some experts believe that the rooster may be the bird depicted on the torii, a gate that marks the entrance to a shrine.

This suggests that there was a belief in spiritual foxes in ancient Japan.関裕二 『寺社が語る秦氏の正体』 祥伝社新書 2018年 ISBN 978-4-396-11553-1 p.38.' The \"Chujin Harai-kun,\" a book written in the 12th century, states that the kami's messenger is second only to the eight great kami and is subordinate to the 100,000 kami. Moreover, \"Kitakami Yuki-fu,\" an essay written in the early 19th century, explains that a ritual called hanasui-iwai is held every year on January 15th. During this ritual, every new household is given a Shinshi. == Examples == Animal Kami Cow Tenjin Fox Inari Ōkami Pigeon Hachiman Sea Snake Izumo-taisha Chicken Amaterasu == Gallery == File:DazaifuTenmanguCow.jpg|Reclining Cow Statue (Dazaifu City, Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine) File:Wake Jinja guardian wild boar koma-inoshishi Agyo- right.jpg|Guardians (Wake Shrine, Wake Town) File:Dômyô-ji-ten'man-gû Shintô Shrine - Statue of a cattle - \"Nade-ushi\".jpg|Reclining Cow Statue (Domyoji Tenmangu Shrine, Fujiidera City, Osaka Prefecture) File:Kurama-dera Statue of Tiger.jpg|A-Un Tiger (Kuramadera, Kyoto City) File:Fushimi Inari Fox.jpg|Statue of Inari (Fushimi Inari Taisha, Kyoto City) File:岡崎神社 - 狛うさぎ2.JPG|Koma rabbit (Okazaki Shrine, Kyoto City) File:Hiraoka-jinja Shika no zou.jpg|Statue of a deer (Higashiosaka City, Hiraoka Shrine) File:Kumano- hongû-taisha Shrine - Yatagarasu-Postbox.jpg|Yatagarasu Post (Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine, Tanabe City) File:Omiwa Shrine - Statue of horse.jpg|Statue of a sacred horse (Ookami Shrine, Ichinomiya City) File:Hie Shrine Saru- gami.jpg|Statue of Monkey God (Hie Shrine, Tokyo) == Related pages == * Komainu * Yatagarasu == References == Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Shinto",
