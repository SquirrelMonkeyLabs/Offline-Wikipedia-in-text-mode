 "text": "Lawrence of Arabia is a British epic movie from 1962, based on the life of T. E. Lawrence. It stars Peter O'Toole as the title character, along with Omar Sharif and Alec Guinness. The opening scene of the movie shows Lawrence dying in a motorcycle accident. The movie then goes into a series of flashbacks (past events) from his life. The 1982 movie Gandhi follows the story pattern of Lawrence of Arabia's: after the main character dies at the start, it moves into a series of flashbacks from Gandhi's life. Lawrence of Arabia won seven Academy Awards, one of them for Best Picture. Considered one of the greatest movies ever made, it has appeared on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list (as the number five selecion). A director's cut of the movie, running at 216 minutes, has no women talking in it. == Other websites == * * Greatest Films * RaveCentral Category:1962 drama movies Category:1962 adventure movies Category:1962 war movies Category:British adventure movies Category:British biographical movies Category:British drama movies Category:British war movies Category:Movies directed by David Lean Category:United States National Film Registry movies Category:Multilingual movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:Movies set in deserts Category:Movies composed by Maurice Jarre",
