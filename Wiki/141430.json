 "text": "\"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" is a 1995 song written by Bryan Adams, Michael Kamen and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange for the movie Don Juan DeMarco. The melody is used as a musical motif throughout the movie, and the song is featured three times in the movie, twice performed by other artists in Spanish, and finally performed by Adams himself during the closing credits. The Adams version of the song, which features flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia, is featured on the soundtrack album and also on the album 18 Til I Die. It was at number one for five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, making it the third number one song for the songwriting team, and went on to earn them their second Oscar nomination. Various women's groups contacted Adams when the song became popular, which led to his publishing a series of books of photos, with all proceeds going to breast cancer research. == Artists who have covered this song == * Jose Hernandez and Nydia, whose Spanish-language duet is featured in Don Juan DeMarco * Chitãozinho & Xororó translated to \"Um Homem Quando Ama\" (from \"Chitãozinho & Xororó) PolyGram, 1995 * Il Divo translated to \"Un Regalo Que Te Dio La Vida\" (from \"Siempre\") RCA, 2006 * Pedro Fernandez translated to \"La Mujer Que Amas\" (from \"Pedro Fernandez\") Polygram Mexico, 1995. * Highway 101 and Paulette Carlson (from \"Reunited\"), Willow Tree Records, 1996. * James Last (from \"Pop Symphnies 2\") Instrumental version, Polydor Records, 1997. * Linda Evangelista (from \"Man to Woman: Men of Note Sing for a Cause\"), PolyGram, 1998. * Eric Hansen (from \"Without Words\" Flamenco 2001 and also \"Nuevo Flamenco Romancero\") Neurodisc, 2001. * Rick Trevino on In My Dreams, 2003. == Track listings == ; CD single # \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" — 4:52 # \"Low Life\" — 4:17 == Certifications == Country Certification Date Sales certified AustriaAustrian certifications ifpi.at(Retrieved May 6, 2008) Gold August 15, 2004 15,000 GermanyGerman certifications musikindustrie.de (Retrieved May 6, 2008) Gold 1995 150,000 SwedenSwedish certifications Ifpi.se .
