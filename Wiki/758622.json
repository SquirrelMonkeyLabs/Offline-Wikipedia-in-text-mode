 "text": "\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" is a song sung by actress and singer Marilyn Monroe on May 19, 1962, for President John F. Kennedy at a celebration of his 45th birthday, 10 days before the actual date (May 29). Monroe sang the traditional \"Happy Birthday to You\" lyrics with an intimate voice, with \"Mr. President\" instead of Kennedy's name. The performance was one of her last major public appearances before her death less than three months later on August 4, 1962. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who did not go to many Democratic Party events, spent the day at the Loudon Hunt Horse Show with her children, John and Caroline. Monroe was accompanied by jazz pianist Hank Jones. ==References== Category:1962 in the United States Category:John F. Kennedy",
