 "text": "Armenian rock is a type of rock music sung by Armenian people. In the Soviet era,rock music was forbidden because the CPSU believed it was a \"Western anti- socialist\" influence. However, in the 1980s popular rock bands in Armenia began to emerge. The Armenians blended folk music with their rock music. After Bolshevism, progressive rock music began to be popular among Armenian people. Since 2004, the Armenian Music Awards honors musicians who record rock music.
