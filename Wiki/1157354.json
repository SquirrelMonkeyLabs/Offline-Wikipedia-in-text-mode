 "text": "The Golden Ass is the popular name of the Metamorphoses by Apuleius. Like the Metamorphoses by Ovid, these are about humans changing into animal form. The name 'The Golden Ass', or Asinus Aureus only appeared in late Antiquity. Church father Augustinus used it to refer to the work. It is possible that Apuleius chose a double title.
