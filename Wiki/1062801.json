 "text": "In internet aesthetics, liminal spaces are empty or abandoned places that are eerie or surreal. Liminal spaces are places that are usually busy that appear empty for an unnatural reason. Some research has shown that liminal spaces may appear eerie or strange because they fall into an uncanny valley of architecture. The aesthetic gained popularity in 2019 after a post on 4chan showing a liminal space called the Backrooms went viral. Since then, liminal space images have been posted across the internet, including on Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok. ==References== Category:Internet Category:Art",
