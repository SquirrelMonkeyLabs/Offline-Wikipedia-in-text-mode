The tale has been adapted to the stage, movies, television, and other media.Zipes pp. 95-7 == Story == A widower marries a very proud woman. She already has two daughters. They despise the man's daughter by his first marriage, but she is gentle and beautiful, They treat her meanly. She is told to do all the housework and sleeps in the attic.

Cinderella stays at home crying. Her fairy godmother appears and changes a pumpkin into a golden coach to take Cinderella to the ball. The fairy turns mice, lizards, and a rat into horses and coachmen by waving her wand. She gives Cinderella a gown of gold and silver and slippers made of glass. She orders Cinderella to return home by midnight because that's when the charm ends. Cinderella goes to the ball. Everyone is amazed. The prince gives her special attention. Her stepsisters do not recognize her. She leaves at midnight and returns home. The next evening she goes again to the prince's ball.
