He led the Sri Lankan Armed Forces to the military defeat of the Tamil tigers, ending the Sri Lankan Civil War. In mid 2022, massive protests broke out in the country against Rajapaksa and his government because of his bad handling of the country's economy. On 9 July 2022, Rajapaksa left his official residence in Colombo before protesters broke into the residence. Protesters were seen taking over the mansion even swimming in the president's pool. Later that evening, it was announced he would resign on 13 July 2022. On the day he promised he would resign, he left the country by military plane to the Maldives without resigning as president. On 14 July, he left the Maldives after people there protested his arrival and left to Singapore. On 14 July, Rajapaksa resigned from presidency. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Sri Lanka",
