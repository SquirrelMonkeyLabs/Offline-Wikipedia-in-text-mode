The convention was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City from August 11 to August 14, 1980. The 1980 convention was known as it was the last time in the 20th century, for either major party, that a candidate tried to get delegates released from their voting commitments. This was done by Senator Ted Kennedy, Carter's primary challenger for the nomination in the Democratic primaries. President Carter gave his speech accepting the party's nomination on August 14. ==References== Category:1980 in New York (state) Category:20th century in New York City Category:United States presidential nominating conventions Category:Democratic Party (United States) Category:1980 events Category:August events",
