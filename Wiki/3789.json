 "text": "The PlayStation (often known as the PS1 or the PSX) is a video game console made by Sony released in December 1994. At the time, it was competing against the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. PlayStation games were stored on CDs. The controllers that were first released with the console had no analog joysticks on them, but analog joysticks and a vibration feature were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the PS One was released in 2000. It was white instead of grey. It was succeeded by the PlayStation 2 in March 2000 and was discontinued on March 23, 2006 (eight months before the PlayStation 3 was released). ==History== The PlayStation was created by Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who managed a engineering division and was later nicknamed \"the Father of the PlayStation\". The PlayStation was released in 1994 in Japan and 1995 in North America and Europe ==Sales== The PlayStation and the PSOne have sold over 120 million consoles. Archived from the original ==Peripherals== ===PocketStation=== The PocketStation was a very small games console released as a peripheral (an extra accessory) for the PlayStation. It had a clock, an LCD display and four buttons. It could be used as a memory card. It wasn't released in the United States, because it did not sell well. ==References== Category:PlayStation (brand)",
