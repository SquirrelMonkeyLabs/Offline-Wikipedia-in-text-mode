It appears to be full of ignorance and dogmatic error. So at the teacher's request, he started writing Tafsee, and completed it in 2013. Shaykh Kaushar Ershad and Shaykh Muhammad Ilyas ibn Saleh co-edited the tafsir. ==Characteristics== In the Tafsir, besides collecting information from various Tafsirs including Tafsir Ibn Kasir, Tafsir Jalalain, Tafsir Tabari, Tafsir Tabarani, Tafsir Bayanul Qur'an, Tahfimul Qur'an, in addition to collecting information from various Tafsirs directly from Hadith books, Hadiths are quoted in the explanation of verses, and explanations are attached from various books.
