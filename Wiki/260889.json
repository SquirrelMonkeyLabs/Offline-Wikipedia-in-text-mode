 "text": "The Border Collie is a breed of dog that originated along the English-Scottish border. It is one of the most intelligent dog breeds. They have been used to herd livestock for over 300 years. It is also famous for a pet or show-dog. The border collie is about 20 inches (51 cm) in height and weighs 31 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kg). It is usually a long-haired dog. Its coat is often black and white in color. The Border Collie is a member of the collie dog breed group. As with other herding and sheepdogs, border collies can be fiercely protective of their territory and their owners. This inclination (likelihood) to protect their family makes them ideal guard dogs. If a border collie notices anything new, they will always alert the family by barking loudly. Exercise is one of the most important aspects of caring for a Border Collie. The herding dog breed has had over a hundred years of genetic reinforcement (to strengthen) to provide them with intelligence, agility, and a high energy level to perform a job (wrangling sheep) that they generally no longer have to do. This is why Border Collies are not recommended for pet owners who may be unable to provide their dogs with high amounts of exercise. == References == Category:Dog breeds originating in the United Kingdom Category:FCI breeds",
