 "text": "The Coppergate Helmet (or York Helmet) is an eighth-century Anglo-Saxon helmet found in York. It was discovered in May 1982. The helmet is one of six Anglo- Saxon helmets which have survived to the present day. It is by far the best preserved. It is similar to the helmet found in Wollaston, Northamptonshire. Other helmets—from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, Shorwell, and Staffordshire—are also similar. These \"crested helmets\" were used in England and Scandinavia from the sixth to eleventh centuries. This helmet is now in the collections of the Yorkshire Museum. == References == Category:Anglo-Saxons Category:Archaeological sites in England Category:Armour Category:Helmets",
