 "text": "Rallying is a form of motorsport with many competitive elements like speed tests, navigation tests, or the ability to reach a set place at a set time or average speed. Rallies may be short or very long (several thousand miles) in an extreme endurance rally. Rallies may be raced on private or public roads, open or closed to traffic, or off-road in the form of cross country or rally raid. Racers can use normal cars, which must be appropiate for the road if they are used on public roads or specially built racecars suited to crossing specific ground. Rallying is different from other forms of motorsport because racers don't race each other in many laps, but they leave one by one from a set place and arrive one by one at another. == Rally types == Rallies are often of two types, road rallies and cross-country (or off-road).
