 "text": "Charles Wesley (18 December 1707 â€“ 29 March 1788) was the brother of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. They were sons of Susanna and Samuel Wesley, who was an English cleric. John and Charles were very serious in their religion while students at Oxford University. They went as missionaries to the English colony of Georgia in North America as priests of the Christian religion. They continued to search for a stronger Christian faith. They later had an experience of personal salvation and began to spread their beliefs in England. Charles wrote thousands of songs about their faith. One of his most famous songs is \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\". It has been sung at royal weddings in the United Kingdom. Christian Hymnbooks of many different churches have the songs of Charles Wesley. == References == Category:1709 births Category:1788 deaths",
