 "text": "William Sealy Gosset was a famous English statistician. He worked for Guinness brewery in Ireland. He created new ways to analyze small sets of data. He wrote his findings under the name \"Student\". His most famous work is the \"Student's t-distribution\". == Life == William was born in Canterbury, England. He went to school at Winchester College and then studied natural sciences and mathematics at New College, Oxford. He had three kids: Harry, Bertha Marian, and Ruth. == Work == At the brewery, William made new ways to test and improve beer quality using statistics. He learned these methods by studying, trying different things, and working with other experts. He wrote about his findings, but because of a rule at Guinness, he couldn't use his real name or mention beer. So, he wrote under the name \"Student\". This is why his famous \"t-distribution\" is called \"Student's\" instead of \"Gosset's\". The site cites Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York: Scribner's, 1972), pp. 476–477; International Encyclopedia of Statistics, vol. I (New York: Free Press, 1978), pp. 409–413. == Relationship with Fisher == Another statistician, Ronald A. Fisher, noticed the value of William's work. They wrote many letters to each other. Fisher helped William improve his methods, and they both shared their findings. In 1935, William became the main brewer for a new Guinness brewery in London. He died in 1937 from a heart attack. People remembered William as a kind man who made big contributions to statistics. He was friends with both Pearson and Fisher. == Legacy == William's methods are still used today in statistics. For example, the \"studentized range\" is a way to compare data points. It was introduced by William in 1927 and is still important in modern statistics. ==References== Category:1876 births Category:1937 deaths Category:British statisticians Category:People from Kent",
