 "text": "The revealed frog, orange-thighed tree frog or whirring tree frog (Litoria revelata) is a frog from Australia. It is related to the brown tree frog. It lives in three different places in Queensland and New South Wales, but scientists think the frogs living in different places might be different species. The male frog is 26 to 28 mm long from nose to rear end. The female is 30 to 36 mm long. This frog can live in swamps near the coast up to rainforests in the mountains. Scientists say people can tell whether a frog is a revealed frog by looking at it because it has much larger discs at the ends of its toes than other frogs do and because it sometimes has black spots on its middle. People can tell it apart from other frogs by listening to it because its voice is around 4 Hz. It has long legs and a stripe from its nose to each armpit. It is cream-brown or red-brown in colour. It may have orange on its legs. Scientists knew this frog existed in at least the 1960s, but it was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first formal paper about it, in 1982. It lays its eggs in still water. This frog is not endangered but people do damage its habitat by removing trees and bringing cows there to eat the grass. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
