 "text": "Gremlins is a 1984 American comedy horror movie written by Chris Columbus and directed by Joe Dante. The movie is about a kid who receives a strange creature called a mogwai as a pet, which then turns other creatures who transform into small, destructive, evil monsters. The movie stars Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates, with Howie Mandel. Steven Spielberg was the movie's executive producer. It was followed by a sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, in 1990. Despite being a critical and commercial success, the movie had mixed reviews. This movie is one of the reasons why the PG-13 rating was created because it was made as a family movie, but had some violence and bloody scenes. ==References== Category:1984 horror movies Category:1984 comedy movies Category:American science fiction horror movies Category:American black comedy movies Category:Movies directed by Joe Dante Category:Movies composed by Jerry Goldsmith Category:1980s black comedy movies Category:1980s science fiction horror movies Category:1980s English-language movies Category:Warner Bros. movies Category:American fantasy-comedy movies Category:Christmas movies Category:Movies featuring puppetry Category:Movies set in New York (state) Category:1980s monster movies Category:American monster movies",
