Deng never held office as the head of state or the head of government, but was the de facto leader of the People's Republic of China from 1978 to the early 1990s. Deng has often been described as practical due to his open market policies after the death of Mao, whilst not deviating much from the original socialist elements of the People's Republic of China. Deng was born in Guang'an, Sichuan. He died of an infection and Parkinson's disease in Beijing, aged 92. == Early life and family == Deng's father, Deng Wenming, was a middle-level landowner.

Feng had asked the Soviet Union for help. But at that time, the Soviet Union supported the Communists' alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang. In 1929 Deng led the Baise Uprising in Guangxi province against the Kuomintang government. The uprising failed, and Deng went to the Central Soviet Area in Jiangxi province. ==Political career== Deng went on the Long March with Mao.
