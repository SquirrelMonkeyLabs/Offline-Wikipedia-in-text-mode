 "text": "The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is an agency of the European Union. It manages the evaluation and quality of pharmaceutical products. It started in 1995. The idea was to make it easier for companies to sell medicines in all the different countries without having to meet different rules in each one. It also encourages competition across borders. Until 2019 it was in London, but after Brexit it moved to Amsterdam. It checks the safety of medicines through a pharmacovigilance network which collects adverse drug reaction reports. ==References== Category:Agencies of the European Union Category:Organizations based in the Netherlands Category:Pharmacology Category:Medical and health organizations",
