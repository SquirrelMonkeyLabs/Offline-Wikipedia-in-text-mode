 "text": "Environmentalism is both a philosophy and a social movement that is about protecting nature. It advocates helping to preserve, protect, and restore the natural environment from damage. Environmentalists often talk about threats to the earth from pollution, climate change and overpopulation. Environmentalism is both personal and political. In their own lives, environmentalists do things that are better for the earth, such as recycling, using natural products, and supporting businesses that try not to harm the environment. Politically, they support laws that help the environment, like laws against pollution. The word Environmentalism comes from 'environmental' and '-ism'. 'Environmental' is the chemical, physical, and biological components of the environment while '-ism' is a suffix used to create action nouns out of verbs. == Related pages == *Anti-capitalism *Car-free movement *Climate change *Conservation biology *Earth Day *Ecology *Environmental art *Green politics *Greenwashing *Reforesting *Right to a healthy environment *Simple living *Sustainability *United Nations Environment Programme *Voluntary Human Extinction Movement ==Further reading== ===Differing arguments=== * ==References== Category:Environmental issues Category:Green politics",
