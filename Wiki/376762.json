 "text": "Taco John's International is a franchisor of a chain of fast food restaurants serving Tex-Mex food, along with its trademark side dish, Potato Ol√©s, which are disc-shaped tater tots with a company-secret and spicy Tex-Mex flavor baked in. The chain is headquartered in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Taco John's was started in 1969 by Harold Holmes and Jim Woodson, with the name \"John\" referring to John Turner, who founded the concept and sold it to the two other men to franchise it. The chain has about 400 restaurants. It is usually found in smaller to medium-sized cities, rather than everywhere like competitor Taco Bell is.
