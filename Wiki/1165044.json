 "text": "The yellow-bellied stream frog (Allobates flaviventris) is a frog. It lives in Brazil and Bolivia. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.7 to 19.7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult frog is 9.3 - 21.1 mm long. The skin of the frog's back can be light gray, gray-brown, or cream-brown in color. These frogs have brown marks in the shape of an hourglass on their backs. The top of the front leg is cream-tan in color. The tops of the back legs are light brown with dark brown stripes going across. The adult males have purple-gray throats with dark marks on the vocal sac. The chest and belly are gold-yellow in color. The adult female frog has yellow color on her throat and front. Her belly is yellow, gold-yellow, or cream-yellow in color. Some parts of the back legs and where the front legs meet the body are gold in color. There is a light gray or brown stripe on the side of the body. Some frogs have a stripe going across with white spots from the eye to where the back legs meet the body. The iris of the eye is bronze in the middle with gold at the edges and black marks going through it. The pupil of the eye is all black. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in forests with bamboo plants in them. Scientists saw the frog 150 meters above sea level. Scientists know that the frog lives in at least one protected park: Parque Nacional de Paca√°s Novos. ==Young== The male frog sits on the dead leaves on the ground and calls. The female frogs lay eggs on the ground. They lay eggs during the rainy part of the year. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to streams, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. It may be in some danger because people set fires and change the places where it lives to make farms and get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
