 "text": "Hindu astrology, also called Indian astrology or Jyotisha (), is the traditional Hindu system of predicting events based on the stars and planets. It is also called Vedic astrology. Among six major studies in Hinduism, it is connected with the Vedas. One of the earliest writings about stars and planets in the Vedas is called Vedanga Jyotisha. While some consider Indian astrology to have originated from the Greek influences, others believe that it is purely an Indian invention, though it may have received some admixture with the Greek. Most scientists agree that astrology is not a real science. The studies and tests have not yet shown evidence that it works. == References == Category:Astrology Category:Superstitions Category:Hinduism",
