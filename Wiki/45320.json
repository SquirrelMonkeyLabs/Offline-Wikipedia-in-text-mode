 "text": "The Georgia Institute of Technology is a public university (school for after high school) in Atlanta, Georgia. It is also known as Georgia Tech. It focuses primarily on engineering, science and computer science, but also has schools of management, architecture, and liberal arts. When it opened in 1885, the school's main focus was on practical experience (learning things by doing them); students spent half of their time in class, and half in the shop. It first admitted women in 1952. In 1961, it was the first university in the South to integrate (let people of different races go to school together) without a court order. The school's colors are white and old gold (mustard yellow). Their mascot is Buzz, a Yellow Jacket (a kind of bee-like wasp). ==References== * Category:Association of American Universities Georgia Tech Category:Georgia Institute of Technology Category:Oak Ridge Associated Universities Category:1885 establishments in the United States Category:19th- century establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)",
