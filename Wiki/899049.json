 "text": "The M Ocean View is a Muni Metro light rail line in San Francisco. The line was established in 1925. ==Route description== === Operation === The M Ocean View begins service at 5 a.m. on weekdays, 6 a.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. Sundays, with the end of service occurring around 12:30 a.m. each night. ==History== The M Ocean View line began operation on October 6, 1925, as a shuttle service from St. Francis Circle to Broad and Plymouth in the city's Ocean View District. It went through the Twin Peaks Tunnel to the downtown Ferry Building on October 31, 1927, but went back to a shuttle service on February 27, 1928. The shuttle service was replaced by buses on August 6, 1939, but streetcar service returned on December 17, 1944. On June 6, 1948, the Transbay Terminal became the inner terminus of the line. ===Changes in 1980s=== While many streetcar lines switched to bus operations after World War II, the M Ocean View remained a streetcar line due to its use of the Twin Peaks Tunnel. On August 30, 1980, the line went further to Balboa Park BART station. The full line switched to light-rail operations with the opening of the Muni Metro system on December 17, 1980. ==References== ==Other websites== * SFMTA - M Ocean View Category:Muni Metro lines Category:1925 establishments in California",
