 "text": "Shekhani (شیخانی) is a name for the Nuristani language spoken in Chitral District of northwestern Pakistan. Sheikhani is presumed to be a variety of Kata-vari language. It is one of the many Languages of Chitral. Around 12,000 people speak the language. Currently there is a Latin script and Arabic script being developed for Shekhani.· The Khowar name for it is ‘’Sheikhwar’’ which means “Language of the Sheikhs or converts”. It is currently endangered due to its isolation from other Nuristani languages and close proximity to Dardic and Iranian languages. == Usage == The name \"Shekhani\" is used for the Eastern Kata-vari dialect. But because Kamviri in Chitral is borrowing many words from Shekhani, it is also called Kamviri and is now very close. Shekhani is known as \"Sheikhwar\" in Khowar while Kamviri is known as \"Shekhaniwar\". Some sources site Shekhani as a term used for the Nuristani dialects and languages, but some just use it for the Eastern Kata-vari dialect. == Alphabet == Abdurrahman L. Rundi along with FLI created a alphabet and writing system in Nastaliq since 26 June, 2022. == References == Category:Languages of Pakistan Category:Languages of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Category:Indo-Iranian languages Category:Chitral District",
