 "text": "1,1,1-Trichloroethane, or methyl chloroform is an organic compound with the formula . It is also known as chlorothene (a trade name from the 1950s). It is a colourless, heavy liquid that was previously used as a solvent but banned after it was discovered to harm the ozone layer. Methyl chloroform is a chlorinated derivative of ethane and an isomer of 1,1,2-Trichloroethane (). The 1,1,2-Trichloroethane isomer is less known, so \"trichloroethane\" often just refers to 1,1,1-Trichloroethane. It should also not be confused with trichloroethylene, another industrial solvent. It is a liquid at 25 degrees Celsius, at standard atmosphere (a pressure). ==History== 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was discovered by the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault. It was used as an experimental anaesthetic in the 1880s, but this practice was dropped because it was hard to produce back then. ==Uses== Before being banned for its harmful effects on the ozone layer, Trichloroethane was commonly used as a cleaning fluid in both homes and industry. Industrial uses include metal degreasing (cleaning metals from oils and grease), similar to trichloroethylene (TCE). Trichloroethane was introduced to metal cleaning as a less toxic alternative to TCE. One other common use of Trichloroethane was for washing photographic film. Most uses for trichloroethane used carbon tetrachloride previously.Morrison, R. D., Murphy, B. L. (2013). Chlorinated Solvents: A Forensic Evaluation. UK Royal Society of Chemistry. Household uses for trichloroethane included stain removers, correction fluids and aerosols. ==References==",
