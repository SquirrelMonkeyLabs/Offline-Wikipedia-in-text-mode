 "text": "Incineration is a form of waste disposal in which waste is burnt. Incineration converts the waste into ash, flue gas, and heat. The heat can be used to generate electricity with a steam turbine. ==History== The first incinerators for waste disposal were built in Nottingham by Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. in 1874. They were originally known as destructors. The first incinerator in the US was built in 1885 on Governors Island in New York, NY. Incinerators are controversial because they can pollute the air, but they also have environmental benefits such as reducing the need for landfills and generating electricity that might otherwise be generated by burning coal. == References == Category:Waste management",
