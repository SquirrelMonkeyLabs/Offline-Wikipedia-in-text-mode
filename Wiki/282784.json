 "text": "Adelina Patti (10 February 184327 September 1919)Her birth date is sometimes given as 19 February 1843. According to this newspaper report, an entry in the Madrid baptisms book No. 43, p. 153, showed that Patti was born in the afternoon of 10 February 1843. The Indianapolis journal, 7 April 1901, p. 14, col. 4 ('Musical Notes') was a highly acclaimed Italian-French 19th-century opera diva, earning huge fees, sometimes $5000 in gold, at the height of her career in the music capitals of Europe and America. She first sang in public as a child in 1851, and gave her last performance before an audience in 1914. ==Biography== She was born Adelina Juana Maria Patti,Sadie: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, 918 in Madrid, the last child of tenor Salvatore Patti (1800â€“1869) and soprano Caterina Barilli (died 1870). Her Italian parents were working in Madrid, Spain, at the time of her birth. Because her father came from Sicily, Patti was born a subject of the King of the Two Sicilies, but had a French passport for most of her life, as two of her three husbands were French. She settled in South Wales in 1903, and after her last concert, for the Red Cross, in 1914 she died there, of natural causes. ==References== Category:Italian singers Category:French opera singers Category:Italian opera singers Category:People with foods named after them Category:1843 births Category:1919 deaths Category:19th-century singers Category:20th-century singers",
