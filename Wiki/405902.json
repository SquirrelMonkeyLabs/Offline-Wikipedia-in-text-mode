 "text": "In mathematics a holomorphic function is a function that is defined on the complex numbers plane, and that can be differentiated everywhere where it is defined. Differentiating the function again leads to a function defined on the complex numbers. In older literature, these functions are sometimes called regular. Holomorphic functions show a number of properties function defined on real numbers do not have. Category:Functions and mappings Category:Complex analysis",
