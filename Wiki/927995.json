 "text": "The heat death of the universe or just heat death is a theory about how our universe might end. It would involve entropy reaching its maximum state and thermodynamics ceasing. It will not happen for an extremely long time. The very earliest estimates place it as 10^100 years from now, or one with one hundred zeros. It may take even longer than that.
