 "text": "A sentence is a group of words that are joined together to mean something. It is the basic unit of language amd expresses a complete thought. It does so by following the grammatical basic rules of syntax: Ram is walking. A complete sentence has at least a subject and a main verb to state (declare) a complete thought: She walks. A subject is the noun (name) that does the main verb. The main verb is the activity that the subject does. In English and many other languages, the first word of a written sentence has a capital letter. At the end of the sentence there is a punctuation mark depending on whether it is a statement, a question, a command, a request or an exclamation. == Phrases and clauses == A phrase or clause is part of a sentence.McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. The Oxford companion to the English language. Oxford University Press.p773â€“777 This is an example of a sentence: * The dog is happy. In this sentence, The dog is the subject, and is is the verb. This is an example of a phrase: * The happy dog There is no verb and so we do not know anything about what the happy dog is doing. Therefore, it is not a sentence. A clause is a sentence within a sentence: * They milked the cows, and then they made cheese and butter. This sentence has two co-ordinate (equal) clauses, linked by and.p220 ==Types of sentence== * A simple sentence has only one clause and one independent variable: The cat is sleeping. * A compound sentence has two or more clauses, which are joined with conjunctions, punctuation, or both: The dog is happy, but the cat is sad. * A complex sentence has one clause with a relative clause: The dog, which is eating the bone, is happy. * A complex-compound sentence (or compound-complex sentence) has many clauses, at least one of which is a relative clause: The dog, which is eating the bone, is happy, but the cat is sad. Sentences have different purposes: * A declarative sentence, or declaration, is the most common type of sentence. It tells something. It ends with a full stop . (The dog is happy.) * An interrogative sentence, or question, asks something. It ends with a question mark ? (Are you happy?) * An exclamatory sentence, or exclamation, says something out of the ordinary. It ends with an exclamation mark ! (That dog is the happiest dog I have ever seen!) * An imperative sentence, or command, tells someone to do something. It ends with a full stop . (Give the dog a bone.) == Basic English sentences == Here are some sentences written in Basic English: The sky is blue. Today is Monday. Tomorrow is Tuesday. The baby is smiling. Sheila is reading a book. This is the road to take. Read a book about the history of America. There are beautiful flowers growing in the garden. The cushions are new and I feel the comfort they give me.
