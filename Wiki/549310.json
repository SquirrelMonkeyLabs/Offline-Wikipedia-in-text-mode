The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of Vienne are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 861 Châtellerault Châtellerault 112,313 2,065.0 92 862 Montmorillon Montmorillon 74,852 2,998.8 95 863 Poitiers Poitiers 246,038 1,925.7 87 ==History== Since its creation, the Vienne department has had some changes: * 1790 : creation of the Vienne department with six districts: Châtellerault, Civray, Loudun, Lusignan, Montmorillon and Poitiers.
