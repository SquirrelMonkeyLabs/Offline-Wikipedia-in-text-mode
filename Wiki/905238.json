 "text": "Shapi Leima (Shabi Leima) or Sapi Leima (Sabi Leima) is the goddess of rodents in Meitei mythology and religion. She is a sister of goddesses Khunu Leima and Nganu Leima. Legend says that all three sisters married the same mortal man. == Etymology == The Meitei female given name \"Sapi Leima\" (ꯁꯄꯤ ꯂꯩꯃ) or \"Sabi Leima\" (ꯁꯕꯤ ꯂꯩꯃ) is made up of two component words. The two words are \"Sabi\" (ꯁꯕꯤ) and \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ). \"Sabi\" (ꯁꯕꯤ) is a rat like animal. It lives in the clumps of bamboos. It is known for having sharp teeth. The word \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) is further made up of two component words, \"Lei\" (ꯂꯩ) and \"Ma\" (ꯃ). \"Lei\" (ꯂꯩ) means land or earth. \"Ma\" (ꯃ) means \"mother\". Literally, \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) can be translated as \"Land Mother\" or \"Mother Earth\". But in general context, \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) means a queen or a mistress or a lady. == Description == Goddess Shapi Leima (Shabi Leima) is described as the ruler of all the rodents of the world. At any time, she could summon all the rodents at any place she wishes. She is the youngest daughter of God Salailen (alias Soraren). == Related pages == * Imoinu (Emoinu) - Meitei goddess of wealth * Ireima (Ereima) - Meitei goddess of water * Leimarel (Leimalel) - Meitei goddess of earth * Ngaleima - Meitei goddess of fish * Panthoibi - Meitei goddess of civilization, love and warfare * Phouoibi (Phouleima) - Meitei goddess of agricultural crops * Thumleima - Meitei goddess of salt == References == == Bibliography == * Glimpses of Manipuri Culture - Dr. Yumlembam Gopi Devi * The History of Manipur: An early period - Wahengbam Ibohal Singh · 1986 == Other websites == * Category:Meitei gods and goddesses Category:Leima",
