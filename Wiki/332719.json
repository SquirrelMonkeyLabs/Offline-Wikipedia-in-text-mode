 "text": "Night of the Hurricane is a three-part crossover event in the Animation Domination block on Fox. It included three animated series created by Seth MacFarlane - Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show. The episodes were originally going to be broadcast on May 1, 2011. However, after the 2011 Super Outbreak, a series of tornadoes that killed many people in the Southern United States, Fox decided not to broadcast it on that day. They broadcast rerun episodes of the three shows instead. The three new episodes were broadcast in the next season. == References == Category:2011 in American television Category:Animated television series Category:Family Guy episodes Category:The Cleveland Show Category:American Dad!",
