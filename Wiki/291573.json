 "text": "A thermal power plant is a power plant where steam is used to drive a steam turbine. This turbine is connected to an electrical generator. After this, the water is condensed, and may be used again. This is known as the Rankine cycle. There are different procedures that can be used to heat the water; ==The main Components of a thermal power plant== * Cooling tower * Cooling water pump * transmission line (3-phase) * Step-up transformer (3-phase) * Electrical generator (3-phase) * Low pressure steam turbine * Condensate pump * Surface condenser * Intermediate pressure steam turbine * Steam Control valve * High pressure steam turbine * Deaerator * Feedwater heater * Boiler steam drum * Superheater * Forced draught (draft) fan * Reheater * Combustion air intake * Induced draught (draft) fan ==Main disadvantage of fossil fuel thermal power plant== Fossil fueled thermal power plants produce a large part of man-made CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and efforts to reduce these are varied and widespread. # It occupies lot of space and release gases. ==Related pages== * Geothermic power plant * thermal energy from the oceans * solar power * nuclear power plant * coal and other fossil fuels, such as gas Category:Power plants",
