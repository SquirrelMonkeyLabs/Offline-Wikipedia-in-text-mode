They used to pitch their tents and rest in this area along the banks of the Ichamati. At one point the servants of the Nawab started living in this area for the purpose of collecting rent. In this way, the population gradually increased in this area and the city was built. As a result, this area became known as Nawabganj from Nawabi period. ==References== Category:Upazilas of Dhaka District",
