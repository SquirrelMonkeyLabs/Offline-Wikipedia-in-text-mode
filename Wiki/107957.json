 "text": "The Venus of Berekhat Ram is a stone that was found on the Golan Heights in 1981. Scientists have proposed to classify it as a Venus figurine, because there are traces it was worked on with a stone tool. The things that have been worked can clearly be told apart from the natural stone.d'Errico, F. and Nowell, A, 2000, \"A new look at the Berekhat Ram figurine: implications for the origins of symbolism\", Cambridge Archaeological Journal 10, 123-67. It is therefore agreed that the pebble has been modified by human action, even though it bears little resemblance to the much later \"Venus figurines\" of about 30.000 years ago. == References == Category:Stone Age art Category:Golan Heights Category:Sculptures Category:Prehistory Category:Archaeology",
