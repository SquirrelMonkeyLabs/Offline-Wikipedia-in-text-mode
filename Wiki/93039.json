 "text": "Uecker-Randow is a former district in the eastern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The district was created on 12 June 1994 by joining the old districts of Pasewalk, Ueckermünde and part of the district Strasburg. The district was merged on 4 September 2011 into Vorpommern-Greifswald. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms show a griffin to the left and an eagle to the right. The griffin is the symbol of Pommern, while the eagle is the symbol of Brandenburg. Historically the territory of the district was divided between these two states. The tower in the middle represents a large tower in Pasewalk, the capital of the district. The wavy lines in bottom stand both for the two main rivers which gave the district its name, as well as for the Oder Lagoon of the Baltic Sea. == Towns and municipalities == Amt-free towns #Pasewalk #Strasburg #Ueckermünde Ämter Ämter Ämter *1.
