The apricot is native to China and spread to Europe through the Armenia Highlands. It came to be known throughout the ancient world as the Armenian fruit. Its botanical name Prunus armeniaca, derives from the Latin vernacular for apricot, armeniacum, which some scholars have linked to its Akkadian name . Many scholars place the Indo- European homeland in the Armenian Highlands and the plateau of Asia Minor to the southwest.Johannes Schmidt, Die Urheimat der Indogermanen und das europaïsche Zahlensystem, Weimar, 1890Renfrew, Archaeology and Language, 159-60; Thomas V.
