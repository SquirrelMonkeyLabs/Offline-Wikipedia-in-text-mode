 "text": "Gill Pinnacle (or Gill's Pinnacle) is an inselberg in the far east of Western Australia, on the Ngaanyatjarra Lands. It is part of the Petermann Ranges. It consists of a dome-shaped hill, surrounded by dense shrub; its top is bare rock. The hill has been useful as a landmark, because it marks the location of one of the area's most reliable freshwater rockholes, Gordon's Springs. This is a few hundred meters to the north of the rock. The area is called (also spelled or ) in Pitjantjatjara and Ngaanyatjarra. The first Europeans to visit the area were the explorers Ernest Giles and W. H. Tietkens, in 1874. They saw the rock from Weld Pass, which is further to the west. Giles named the rock after his brother-in-law. He named the waterhole, Gordon's Springs, after his nephew. The closest town to Gill's Pinnacle is Kaltukatjara, Northern Territory, which is about to the east. ==References== ==Other websites== *Gill's Pinnacle on Bonzle Digital Atlas Category:Mountains of Australia Category:Geography of Western Australia",
