 "text": "Dentition is the development of teeth and where the teeth are in the mouth. Almost all mammals have up to four different types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Animals that have different types of teeth are called \"heterodont\". If they do not, they are called \"homodont\". In mammals, the young have a set of primary teeth (milk teeth) that fall out after a few years. When they fall out, adult teeth grow in. Animals that have milk teeth and adult teeth are called diphyodont. == Archaeology == Dentition is important in archaeology. Dentition is used to study human migration. Tooth enamel contains trace elements which show where they grew. == Related pages == *Teeth *Dental formula == References == *Adovasion J. M. and David Pedler. 2005. The peopling of North America.
