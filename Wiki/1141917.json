 "text": "Paisa (also called pice, pesa, poysha, poisha, and baisa) is a small unit of money. The word means money or wealth. In India, Nepal, and Pakistan, one paisa is 1/100 of a rupee. In Bangladesh, one poysha is 1/100 of a Bangladeshi taka. One baisa in Oman equals 1/1000 of an Omani rial. ==Etymology== The word paisa originates from the Sanskrit word padāṁśa. Padāṁśa means quarter part and unit. The pesa was used in colonial Kenya. ==History== Chaulukya coins were known as Gadhaiya Paise. In India and Pakistan the paisa or pice was equal to 3 pies or 1/64 of a rupee until the 1950's. When these countries switched to a decimal system, the paisa became 1/100 of a rupee. ==Terminology== In languages like Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, and Nepali, the word paisa means money. In East Africa, the word pesa for money is still used. An example is Kenya’s M-Pesa, which means \"mobile pesa\" or \"mobile money.\" ==Usage== * Poysha = of a Bangladeshi taka (no longer in circulation) * Paisa = of an Indian rupee (only 50 paisa coins are de facto valid but no longer in circulation) * Paisa = of a Nepalese rupee (no longer in circulation) * Baisa = of an Omani rial * Paisa = of a Pakistani rupee (Officially demonetized from 1 October 2014) ==Gallery== File:100 Baisa Oman reverso.png|100 Omani Baisa note (reverse) File:100 Baisa Oman.png|100 Omani Baisa note (1995) File:৫০ পয়সা ২০০১ সালের নকশা সম্মূখভাগ - 50 Paisa year 2001 Front Part.png|50 Bangladeshi Poysha (2001) File:৫০ পয়সা ২০০১ সালের নকশা - 50 Paisa year 2001 Back Part.png|50 Bangladeshi Poysha (2001, reverse) ==Related pages== *Bangladeshi taka *Indian paisa ==References== Category:Coins Category:Economy of Bangladesh Category:Economy of India Category:Nepal Category:Economy of Pakistan",
