 "text": "Pentation is the 5th hyperoperation, and the first one is addition. Pentation is just repeated tetration, but it produces extremely large unimaginable numbers, a simple 2 ↑↑↑ 3 (or often displayed as 22) is equal to 65,536. Another example is 3 ↑↑↑ 2. It is equal to 7,625,597,484,987 (7.625 Trillions, this number is known as a Tritri) Pentation is calculated like this: 2 ↑↑↑ 3 = ²²2 = ⁴2 = 2^2^2^2 = 65,536 == Etymology == The word \"Pentation\" was coined by Reuben Goodstein (An English Mathematician) by joining together penta- (which means five) and iteration (A mathematical function). It's how he usually named hyperoperations. == References == Category:Hyperoperations",
