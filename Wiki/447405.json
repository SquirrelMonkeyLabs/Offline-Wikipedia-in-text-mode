 "text": "Ibn Taymiyyah (661-728 AH/ 1263-1328 CE) is regarded as one of the prominent Sunni Islamic scholars and mujaddids (renewers or revivers) of Tawheed (the oneness of God within Islam). His full name is Ahmad ibn Abdul Haleem ibn Abdus Salam ibn Taymiyyah. His titles are Sheikh al-Islam, the Imām, the Scholar, the Mufassir (Exegete), the Faqīh (Jurist), the Mujtahid, the Hāfidh, the Muḥaddith (master of hadith). He was a member of the islamic jurisprudence school founded by Ahmad ibn Hanbal. He was notable for wanting to return Islam to what he viewed as earlier interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. He lived during the troubled times of the Mongol invasions in Syam (the Levant). He is the most influential teacher of Ibnul Qayyim. == Views == Ibn Taymiyyah strived to revive Tawheed within Islam by fighting against bid'ah innovation (new things being added to the religion of Islam) in the religion and reviving the way of the Salaf (the 3 best generations of Muslims). He mainly fought against Sufis and considered them as Ahlul Bid'ah (people of Bid'ah). He also fought against mainly the followers of Ash'arism and Maturidism (the majority of Sufis). == Works == * Majmu' al-Fatawa: a collection of religious rulings issued by Ibn Taymiyyah. * Dar' Ta'arud al-Aql wa al-Naql: a collection refuting philosophers using the Qur'an and Sunnah. * Towards Understanding Tadmuriyyah: a book that refutes deviant sects like the Ash'aris or Maturidis. == References == Category:Muslim scholars Category:Philosophers Category:1260s births Category:1328 deaths",
