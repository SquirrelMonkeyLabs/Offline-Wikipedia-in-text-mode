Amsterdam/Philadelphia: Benjamins. == Formation of the language == Jamaican Patois was developed in the 17th century with the arrival of West African slaves. Once they arrived in the island, they had to quickly learn and neutralize the dialectal forms of the English language. The slaves, just like in any region of the Caribbean rather speak their original tongue than learn the proper forms of the European languages of their masters. === Irish influence === Jamaican Creole draws an Irish phonetic sounds in some areas of Jamaica, however, the schools and education in Jamaica are based on the British English in the writing, reading and speech. === African influence === Jamaican Patois has African influences dating back to the 17th century. Its syntax, sounds, phonetics, grammar, and plenty of words show African influence in every aspect. === Chinese and East Indian influence === The Jamaican language has hundreds or thousands of words with origins of the Cantonese and the Indian languages, such as \"Ganja\" (Mariguana). ==References== Category:Pidgins and creoles Category:Languages of the Caribbean Category:Jamaica Category:17th-century establishments in North America",
