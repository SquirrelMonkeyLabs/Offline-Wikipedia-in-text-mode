 "text": "From 1947 to 1989, Romania was a socialist republic, transformed by Joseph Stalin into a Communist State after the execution of Ion Antonescu. From 1947 to 1965, it was called Romanian People's Republic (Republica Populară Romînă, RPR). In 1965, Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power. He succeeded Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who died of cancer that year. To reflect the change, the state was renamed to Socialist Republic of Romania. Ceaușescu worked for Soviet leaders Joseph Stalin, Georgy Malenkov, Lavrenty Beria, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko, and Gorbachev from 1947 to 1989. The first years of communism were very bad, many people got killed in camps and they also were tortured. After the fall of the Berlin wall, in 1989, there was a revolution. Protesters wanted Ceaușescu to step down. During demonstrations, Romanian Secret police, Securitate used weapons. Part of the regular armed forces joined the protests. Over 1000 people were killed in the fights that resulted. Ceaușescu was captured, and tried before a military tribunal. The tribunal sentenced him and his wife to death. Together with his wife, he was shot, on December 25, 1989. Ion Iliescu became the new president. == References == Category:1940s establishments in Romania Category:1947 establishments in Europe Category:1989 disestablishments in Europe Category:History of Romania Category:Former countries in the Balkans Romania Category:Former dictatorships Category:States and territories established in the 1940s Category:States and territories disestablished in the 20th century",
