 "text": "The whistling ducks or tree ducks (Genus: Dendrocygna) are a subfamily of the duck, goose and swan family of birds, Anatidae. In other taxonomy, they are considered a separate family called Dendrocygnidae. == Species == There are eight species of whistling ducks, most of them live in or near the tropics, in a place where there is fresh water. Whistling ducks feed mainly on small animals and plants. Whistling ducks travel in flocks and migrate seasonally. Although White Faced Whistling ducks cannot be sexed by appearance, the male has a distinctly lower pitched voice and when this is first observed, no further difficulty in sex determination is likely to be experienced. A female wild-caught at one year old (face still tinged with brown) survived to 20 years of age before succumbing to avian flu. (Ghana Feb.2022).
