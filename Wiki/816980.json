 "text": "Unicode has characters of chess symbols. This means that chess symbols can be encoded as text instead of images. Algebraic notation (text that shows where to move a chess piece) can be typed using the symbol of the piece. For example, ♘c6 instead of Nc6. == Symbols == The symbols in this table are from the Unicode block named Miscellaneous Symbols. Other chess symbols are in the Chess Symbols block.
