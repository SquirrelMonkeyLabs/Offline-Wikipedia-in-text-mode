 "text": "Agliberto Melendez is a Dominican film director best known as the director of A One Way Ticket (Un Pasaje de Ida), the Dominican Republic's first feature- length film, produced entirely in the Dominican Republic by a Dominican cast and crew. The film became known to American audiences after its 1988 debut in New York City at the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films Festival. A One Way Ticket gained some notoriety because of its macabre subject matter; the story of would be immigrants who die in their desperate struggle to escape a fate of poverty and despair. A One Way Ticket, shot under very adverse conditions, proved to everyone that it could be done. ==Related pages== *Mario Almada *Andrés García *Rubén Aguirre *Amparo Grisales *Noé Murayama *Eric del Castillo *Isela Vega *Tina Romero *Ana Luisa Peluffo Category:Living people Category:Dominican Republic people Category:Film directors",
