After the match The Bucks offered the Lucha Brothers a contract to join All Elite Wrestling (AEW). They signed non-exclusive contracts because they were also signed to Lucha Underground at the time.

At All Out on September 5, the Lucha Brothers defeated the Young Bucks in a steel cage match and won the AEW World Tag Team Championships. This was Pentagón Jr.'s first championship in AEW. Both Dave Meltzer and Bryan Alvarez said that their match was the best cage match that they had ever seen, and that it was one of the best AEW matches in the company's history. Meltzer rated the match 5.75 stars. The brothers lost the AAA World Tag Team Championships to FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) on the October 16 episode of Dynamite, and then the AEW World Tag Team Championship to Jurassic Express on January 5, 2022.
