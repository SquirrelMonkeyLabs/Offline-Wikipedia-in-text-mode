The university is a member of the Coimbra Group. ==Name== The University’s official name is Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg (Julius Maximilian University Würzburg) but it is commonly called the University of Würzburg. This name is taken from two people; Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn, Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, who restarted the University 426 years ago, and Prince Elector Maximilian Joseph, the prince under whom it became public, not religious, at the start of the 19th century. The University’s central administration, foreign student office, and several research institutes are located within the old town. The new liberal arts campus, with its modern library, overlooks the city from the east. The University today has about 21,000 students, of which more than 1,000 come from other countries. Among its students and teachers, the University includes 13 Nobel Prize winners. ==Other websites== *University of Würzburg Wurzburg Category:Würzburg",
