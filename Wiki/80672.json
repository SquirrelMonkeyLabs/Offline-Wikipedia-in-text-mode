 "text": "Military tactics () are the art of organizing an army and the techniques for using weapons or military units to fight an enemy in battle. Tactics are distinct from strategy, which concerns a longer time scale. They have changed over time, mainly because of changes in military technology. Tactics are methods to use military forces in combat and include basically many types of the military operations such as frontal assaults, attempts to flank the enemy, the keeping of troops in reserve, and the use of ambushes. Specialized tactics exist for many situations, such as securing a room or individual building, to large-scale operations, such as establishing air superiority over a region or the use of shock tactics. Military tactics are used at all levels of command, from individual and group up to entire armed forces. The military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said \"tactics is the art of using troops in battle; strategy is the art of using battles to win the war.\"Michiko Phifer, A Handbook of Military Strategy and Tactics (New Delhi: Vij Books India Private Limited, 2012), p. 1 == Bibliography == * Balck, W. 1914.
