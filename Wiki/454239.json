 "text": "Steven Anita \"Steve\" Smith is a fictional character in the animated television series American Dad!. He is voiced by Scott Grimes. He is Stan and Francine Smith's only son and Hayley's younger brother as well as the youngest of the series' six main characters. Steve's original design was much geekier and gawky and he was voiced by Ricky Blitt. Halfway through production, Grimes replaced the design of the character used by Blitt. Steve was made to be more attractive, so he would be less comparable to Neil Goldman from Family Guy.\"Random American Dad Trivia.\" TVTDB.com.
