 "text": "7/7 Ripple Effect is a 57-minute movie made at home produced and narrated under the fake name \"Muad'Dib\", who was later named by the BBC as conspiracy theorist John Hill. The film says some claims in the official account of the 7 July 2005 London bombings (also known as 7/7) were not true. ==Claims proven wrong by the BBC== An episode of the BBC programme The Conspiracy Files named \"7/7\", which first aired on 20 June 2009, looked at part of the claims made in the film as well as other theories surrounding the attacks. The programme also revealed that the person using the fake name Muad'Dib was John Hill from Sheffield, tracking him down to an address in Kells in the Republic of Ireland. ==References== ==Other websites== *Film's Official Website *Rebuttal to Film's Claims *BBC News Magazine (30 June 2009) *BBC News Blog \"The Man Behind 7/7 Ripple Effect\" (24 June 2009) Category:2007 documentary movies Category:2000s English-language movies Category:British movies Category:Conspiracy theories Category:July 2005 London bombings",
