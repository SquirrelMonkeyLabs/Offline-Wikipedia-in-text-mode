 "text": "Ethiopia has one of the longest known histories as a country in Africa. Ethiopia was one of the few countries in Africa that escaped the Scramble for Africa. It avoided being colonized until 1935, when it was invaded by the Italians under Benito Mussolini, who took over the country for a brief time. Ethiopia used to be called Abyssinia. The word \"Ethiopia\" is the combination of two words,\"Eth\" and \"Yop\". The word \"Eth\" was taken from the first king of Ethiopia named \"Etheal\" (meaning: Gift of God) and \"Yop\" (meaning: Yellow Gold) was the place where Etheal was appointed. And \"ia\" shows that Ethiopia is a country name. Generally,Ethiopia means \"Gift of yellow gold for God\". is the most populous landlocked country in the world. It lost its Red Sea ports when Eritrea gained independence in 1993. == History == The idea of an Ethiopian nation became important with the Kingdom of Aksum in the 4th century A.D. The Aksumite Kingdom was a mainly Christian state. At its biggest it controlled what is now the Ethiopian Highlands, Eritrea, and the coastal regions of Southern Arabia. The Aksumite Kingdom was responsible for the development of the religious movement that became the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The expansion of Islam in the 7th century caused the decline of the Aksumite Kingdom. Most of the lowland populations converted to Islam, while the highland people remained Christian. Since the Aksumite people became divided between Christian highlands and Islamic lowlands, religious and tribal tensions and rivalries between the people intensified. The Aksumite society changed into a loose confederation of city-states that maintained traditions and languages influenced by Aksum. After the fall of Aksum due to declining sea trade from fierce competition by Muslims and changing climate, the power base of the kingdom moved south. The capital moved to Kubar (near Agew). The Axumite Kingdom welcomed and protected the companions of Prophet Muhammad in Ethiopia. They came as refugees to escape the persecution of the ruling families of Mecca and earned the friendship and respect of the Prophet. Their friendship deteriorated when South-Arabians invaded the Dahlak islands through the port of Adulis and destroyed it. That was the economic backbone for the prosperous Aksumite Kingdom. After a second golden age in the early 6th century the Aksumite empire began to decline in the mid 6th century,David W. Phillipson (2012): Foundations of an African Civilisation: Aksum and the Northern Horn, 1000 BC – AD 1300. James Currey. p. 209 eventually ceasing its production of coins in the early 7th century. The Aksumite population was forced to go farther inland to the highlands for protection, abandoning Aksum as the capital. Arab writers of the time continued to describe Ethiopia (no longer referred to as Aksum) as an extensive and powerful state, though they had lost control of most of the coast and their tributaries. While land was lost in the north, it was gained in the south. Though Ethiopia was no longer an economic power, it still attracted Arab merchants. The capital was moved to a new location, currently unknown, though it may have been called Ku'bar or Jarmi. Under the reign of Degna Djan, during the 10th century, the empire kept expanding south. It sent troops into the modern-day region of Kaffa,Werner J. Lange, ”History of the Southern Gonga (southwestern Ethiopia)“, Steiner, 1982, p. 18 while at the same time undertaking missionary activity into Angot and Amhara. Local history holds that, around 960, a Jewish Queen named Yodit (Judith) or \"Gudit\" defeated the empire and burned its churches and literature. While there is evidence of churches being burned and an invasion around this time, her existence has been questioned by some western authors. Another possibility is that the Aksumite power was ended by a southern pagan queen named Bani al-Hamwiyah, possibly of the tribe al-Damutah or Damoti of the Sidama people. It is clear from contemporary sources that a female usurper did rule the country at this time, and that her reign ended some time before 1003. After a short Dark Age, the Aksumite Empire was succeeded by the Agaw Zagwe dynasty in the 11th or 12th century (most likely around 1137), although limited in size and scope. However, Yekuno Amlak, who killed the last Zagwe king and founded the modern Solomonic dynasty around 1270 traced his ancestry and his right to rule from the last emperor of Aksum, Dil Na'od. The end of the Aksumite Empire didn't mean the end of Aksumite culture and traditions. The architecture of the Zagwe dynasty at Lalibela and Yemrehana Krestos Church shows heavy Aksumite influence. Axum shifted its capital near Agew In the middle of the sixteenth century. Adal Sultanate armies led by Harar leader Ahmed Gragn invaded the Ethiopian Highlands in what is known as the \"Conquest of Habasha\". Following Gragn invasions the southern part of the Empire was lost to Ethiopia. Several groups like the Gurage people were cut off from the rest of Abyssinia. In the late sixteenth century the nomadic Oromo people penetrated the Abyssinian plains occupying large territories during the Oromo migrations. Abyssinian warlords often competed with each other. The Amharas seemed to gain the upper hand with the accession of Yekuno Amlak of Ancient Bete Amhara in 1270, after defeating the Agaw lords of Lasta. The Gondarian dynasty, which since the 16th century had become the centre of Royal pomp and ceremony of Abyssinia, finally lost its influence as a result of the emergence of powerful regional lords, following the murder of Iyasu I, also known as Iyasu the Great. The decline in the prestige of the dynasty led to the semi- anarchic era of Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Princes\"), in which rival warlords fought for power. The Yejju Oromo enderases (\"regents\") had effective control. The emperors were considered to be figureheads. A young man named Kassa Haile Giorgis also known as Emperor Tewodros brought end to Zemene Mesafint by defeating all his rivals and took the throne in 1855. The Tigrayans made only a brief return to the throne in the person of Yohannes IV in 1872. His death in 1889 resulted in the power base shifting back to the dominant Amharic-speaking elite prior to Yejju Oromo and Tigrayan rule. His successor Menelik II an Emperor of Amhara origin seized power. Lij Iyasu, emperor from 1913 until 1917 became the only Muslim emperor who with Sultan Diiriye Guure, allied with the Central Powers. But, later, both Sultan Diiriye Guure the king of the Dervish Kingdom, and Iyasu were removed from power, with help from the British Empire.Kaplan, Steven. \"The Exaltation of Holy Cross and the Deposition of the Emperor of Ethiopia: Ləj Iyasu a Mäsqäl Drama.\" Northeast African Studies 21.1 (2021): 1-18. League of Nations in 1935 reported that after the invasion of Menelik's forces into non Abyssinian- proper lands of Somalis, Harari, Southern Oromo, Sidama, Shanqella etc., the inhabitants were enslaved and heavily taxed by the gebbar-feudal system leading to depopulation. Some scholars consider the Amhara to have been Ethiopia's ruling elite for centuries, represented by the Solomonic line of Emperors ending in Haile Selassie I. Marcos Lemma and other scholars argue that other ethnic groups have always been active in the country's politics. This confusion may largely stem from the mislabeling of all Amharic-speakers as \"Amhara\" even though they were from a different ethnic group, and the fact that many people from other ethnic groups have adopted Amharic names. Another is the claim that most Ethiopians can trace their ancestry to multiple ethnic groups, including the last self-proclaimed emperor Haile Selassie I and his Empress Itege Menen Asfaw of Ambassel having both Amhara and Oromo linage.Emperor Haile Selassie I, Part 1 , Official Ethiopian Monarchy Website. Oromo migrations, occurred with the movement of a large pastoral population from the southeastern provinces of the Empire. A contemporary account was recorded by the monk Abba Bahrey, from the Gamo region. The empire organization changed progressively, with faraway provinces taking more independence. A remote province such as Bale is last recorded paying tribute to the imperial throne during Yaqob reign (1590-1607). By 1607, Oromos were also major players in the imperial politics, when Susenyos I, raised by a clan through gudifacha(or adoption), took power. He was helped by fellow Luba age- group generals Mecha, Yilma and Densa, who were rewarded by Rist feudal lands, in the present-day Gojjam districts of the same name. The reign of Iyasu I the Great (1682-1706) was a major period of consolidation. It also saw the dispatching of embassies to Louis XIV's France and to Dutch India. During the reign of Iyasu II (1730-1755), the Empire was strong enough to undertake a war on the Sennar Sultanate, where the emperor leading its army to Sennar itself, was afterwards forced to retreat upon defeat along the Setit river. Iyasu II also conferred the dignity of Kantibai of the Habab (northern Eritrea) after homage by a new dynasty. The Wallo and Yejju clans of the Oromo people rise to power culminated in 1755, when Emperor Iyoas I ascended to the imperial throne in Gondar. They would be one of the major factions contending for imperial power during the ensuing Zemene Mesafint, starting from 1769, when Mikael Sehul, Ras of Tigray killed Iyoas I and replaced him with Yohannes II. The establishment of modern Ethiopia was led by the Shawan people (which included both Amharas and Oromos), particularly Amhara emperors Tewodros II of Gondar, who governed from 1855 to 1868. Yohannis IV, who was from Tigray governed from 1869 to 1889 and managed to expand his authority into Eritrea. Menelik II, governed from 1889 to 1913 and repelled the Italian invasion of 1896. From 1874 to 1876, the Empire, under Yohannes IV, won the Ethiopian-Egyptian War, decisively beating the invading forces at the Battle of Gundet, in Hamasien province (in modern-day Eritrea). In 1887 Menelik king of Shewa invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo. Beginning in the 1890s, under the reign of the Emperor Menelik II, the empire's forces set off from the central province of Shoa to conquor inhabited lands to the west, east and south. The territories that were annexed included those of the Western Oromo (non-Shawan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta, and Dizi. Among the imperial troops was Ras Gobena's Shewan Oromo militia. Many of the lands that they annexed had never been under the empire's rule. The newly incorporated territories resulting in the modern borders of Ethiopia. Ethiopia, unlike the rest of Africa, had never been colonized. Ethiopia was accepted as the first independent African-governed state at the League of Nations in 1922. Ethiopia was occupied by Italy after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, but it was liberated by the Allies during World War II. After the war, Ethiopia annexed Eritrea. However, ethnic tensions surged between the Amhara and the various ethnic groups of Eritrea, as well as Oromo, Somali, and Tigray peoples, in Ethiopia proper. They each formed separatist movements dedicated to leaving Ethiopia. After the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy by the Derg military junta, the country was aligned with the Soviet Union and Cuba after the United States failed to support it in its military struggle with Somali separatists in the Ogaden region. After the end of military government in Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea separated from Ethiopia. The Kingdom of Aksum, the first known kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia, rose during the first century AD. The Persian religious figure Mani listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his time. It was in the early 4th century that a Syro-Greek castaway, Frumentius, was taken to the court and over time changed King Ezana to Christianity, making Christianity Ethiopia's religion. For this, he received the title \"Abba Selama\". At different times, including a time in the 6th century, Axum ruled most of modern-day Yemen just across the Red Sea. The line of rulers of the actual Axumite kings ended around 950 AD when they were overthrown by the Jewish Queen Gudit; then it was followed by the Zagwe dynasty for around 300 years. Around 1270 AD, the Solomonid dynasty came to control Ethiopia, claiming that they were related to the kings of Axum ( they were southern Ethiopia people, from Shewa). They called themselves Neguse Negest (\"King of Kings,\" or Emperor), basing their claims on their direct relation to king Solomon and the queen of Sheba. During the rule of Emperor Lebna Dengel, Ethiopia made its first good contact with a European country, Portugal in 1520. When the Empire was attacked by Somali General and Imam, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, Portugal responded to Lebna Dengel's request for help with 400 musketeers, helping his son Gelawdewos beat al-Ghazi and remake his rule. Jesuit missionaries over time offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians, and in the mid-17th century Emperor Fasilidos got rid of these missionaries. Oromo people began to question the Ethiopian Christian authorities in the Abyssinian territories, and wanted to keep their own religion. All of this led to Ethiopia's isolation during the 1700s. The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by warlords like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray. Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that made friendship between the two nations. It was not until the reign of Tewodros II that Ethiopia began to take part in world matters once again. In 1896 Italy was decisively defeated in the battle of Adwa by Emperor Menelik; an Amhara Emperor from the province of Shewa. This battle dispelled the notion that Europeans were superior and could not be defeated by a black army. It gave rise to the Pan African movement, and hope to other African countries who were conquered. This victory made Ethiopia the only African country to successfully repel a European power during the Scramble of Africa. In 1936 Italy again attacked, and succeeded in occupying Ethiopia until 1941. With British help the 5 year occupation ended and Emperor Haile Selassie regained the throne. Revolutionaries overthrew and killed the emperor in 1974. The resulting civil war lasted until 1991. Eritrea became independent and later fought the Eritrean–Ethiopian War. == Ethiopians == Ethiopians constitute several component ethnic groups, many of which are closely related to ethnic groups in neighboring Eritrea and other parts of the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia's population is highly diverse with different languages and ethnic groups. Most of its people speak a Semitic or Cushitic language which are both part of the Afroasiatic language family, while others speak Nilo-Saharan languages. The Oromo, Amhara, Somali and Tigrayans make up more than three-quarters of the population, but there are more than 80 different ethnic groups within Ethiopia. Some of these have as few as 10,000 members. === Component Ethnicities === File:Child labor in Ethiopia 2.jpg|alt=Picture of child labor in Ethiopia of the Amhara people|Amhara people File:Orthodox,_Tigray_(8344861519).jpg|Tigrayans File:Beauty_of_Oromia.jpg|alt=This photo represents the varieties of dressing and hairstyle of the Oromo culture. the kid sitting in front of the group dressed Guji Oromo clothes. the four girls at the back from left to right, dressed Harar, Kamise, Borena and Showa styles and all are Oromo style|Oromo people File:Making_plans_for_the_day,_Harar_(8475619622).jpg|People in Harar ==== Major ethnic groups ==== * Oromo 34.9% * Amhara 27.9% * Tigrayan 7.3% * Sidama 4.1% * Gurage 2.8% * Welayta 3% * Somali 2.7% * Hadiya 2.2% * Afar 0.6% * Other ethnic groups 12.6% Ethnic group Language family Census (1994) United nations Demographic Yearbook Special Census Topics.
