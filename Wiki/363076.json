Strait is referred to as the \"King of Country,\" and critics call Strait a living legend.Bego, Mark. George Strait: The Story of Country's Living Legend. New York: Citadel Press, 2001. He is known for his unique style of western swing music, bar-room ballads, honky- tonk style, and fresh yet traditional Country music. George Strait holds the world record for more number-one hit singles than any other artist in the history of music on any chart or in any genre, having recorded 59 number-one hit singles as of 2012. ==Discography== Strait has been recording with MCA Records for 30 years. He has had 60 No. 1 songs on all country charts (including Mediabase 24/7, the former Radio & Records chart, and the Gavin Report chart), and has more No. 1 hits than any other artist in any genre. His 44 Billboard magazine country No. 1's are a record, four more than Conway Twitty's total that includes several duets with Loretta Lynn. Strait is also the first artist in the history of Billboard magazine to have at least one single enter the Top 10 of a Billboard chart for 30 consecutive years. The first was in 1981 when his first single \"Unwound\" reached No. 6 on the Hot Country Singles chart. All of his Top 10 singles have been on that chart. Strait has sold more than 68 million albums in the United States and 13 multi- platinum, 33 platinum, and 38 gold albums. ;Studio albums * Strait Country (1981) * Strait from the Heart (1982) * Right or Wrong (1983) * Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind (1984) * Something Special (1985) * #7 (1986) * Ocean Front Property (1987) * If You Ain't Lovin' You Ain't Livin' (1988) * Beyond the Blue Neon (1989) * Livin' It Up (1990) * Chill of an Early Fall (1991) * Holding My Own (1992) * Pure Country (1992) * Easy Come, Easy Go (1993) * Lead On (1994) * Blue Clear Sky (1996) * Carrying Your Love with Me (1997) * One Step at a Time (1998) * Always Never the Same (1999) * George Strait (2000) * The Road Less Traveled (2001) * Honkytonkville (2003) * Somewhere Down in Texas (2005) * It Just Comes Natural (2006) * Troubadour (2008) * Twang (2009) * Here for a Good Time (2011) * Love Is Everything (2013) * Cold Beer Conversation (2015) * Honky Tonk Time Machine (2019) * Cowboys and Dreamers (2024) ===Singles=== * \"I Just Can't Go On Dying Like This\" (1976) * \"I Hate Everything\" (2004) * \"The Seashores of Old Mexico\" (2006) ==Sources== Category:1952 births Category:Country musicians from Texas Category:Living people Category:MCA Records artists",
