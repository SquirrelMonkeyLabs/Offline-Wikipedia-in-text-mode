 "text": "Dio Brando or DIO is a recurring character and main antagonist in the manga and anime series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. After killing his father, he was adopted into the Joestar family, where he lived with his newfound adoptive brother, Jonathan Joestar. == Story == === Phantom Blood === In Phantom Blood, after the death of his father, Dario Brando, Dio is adopted as a child by the English nobleman George Joestar I, becoming the adoptive brother of Jonathan Joestar. He aims to make the life of Jonathan miserable, killing his pet dog Danny, and stealing the first kiss of Jonathan's girlfriend, Erina Pendelton. He expects Jonathan to lose hope because of his evil actions, but to Dio's surprise, Jonathan instead fights back. Later, it would appear Dio and Jonathan are good friends, but Dio secretly plots to kill their father, George, to inherit his fortune. He does this by feeding George a poison disguised as medicine. Jonathan realises what Dio is doing and stops him, so Dio runs away. Then, after he discovers the hidden power of the mysterious, ancient Aztec stone mask, he kills George and uses his blood to activate the stone mask's power and turn into a vampire. Then, Dio and Jonathan fight in the burning Joestar mansion, and Jonathan wins, temporarily defeating Dio. After this, Dio spends time to heal and grow an army of zombies and chimera creatures. However, Jonathan uses a technique called Hamon to use the Sun's energy and defeat both Dio and his army. Dio survives the attack with only his head left. With the help of his follower, Wang Chan, he surprises Jonathan on his honeymoon on a ship and successfully kills him. But, Jonathan holds onto Dio's head, even after death, and traps Dio inside the burning ship which sinks to the bottom of the ocean. === Stardust Crusaders === Dio reappears in Stardust Crusaders after around 100 years of being trapped underwater, because a group of fishermen found his coffin. Dio had stolen Jonathan's body, and unlocks his Stand, The World. The World can attack powerfully at very high speeds, and has the ability to stop time. He sends many enemies to attack Jotaro Kujo, a descendant of Jonathan, who wants to kill Dio. However, Jotaro defeats the enemies and is able to fight Dio in a final battle. During this battle, Jotaro realises he can also stop time with his Stand, Star Platinum, and is able to kill Dio once and for all. === Stone Ocean === It is later revealed in Stone Ocean, that Dio had written a diary that contained instructions on how to reach \"Heaven\". After defeating Dio, Jotaro had read the contents of this diary, and later burned it. Many years later, Enrico Pucci, who had met Dio before he fought Jotaro, steals the memory of Jotaro so that he can meet the requirements to reach \"Heaven\" and create the universe that he and Dio imagined together.
