 "text": "The League of Gentlemen is a Britcom that premiered on BBC Two in 1999. The programme is set in Royston Vasey, a fictional town in northern England, originally based on Alston, Cumbria. It is about the lives of bizarre characters, most of whom are played by three of the show's four writers – Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, and Reece Shearsmith – who, along with Jeremy Dyson, formed the League of Gentlemen comedy troupe in 1995. The series originally aired for three series from 1999 until 2002 followed by a movie in 2005. A three-part revival mini-series was broadcast in December 2017 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the group's first appearance on BBC Radio 4. The programme was aired on Comedy Central from summer to autumn 2000. ==References== Category:1999 British television series debuts Category:2002 British television series endings Category:2000s British comedy television series Category:English-language television programs",
