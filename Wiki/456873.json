A new arthropod from the early Cambrian of North Greenland, with a 'great appendage'-like antennula. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 158 (3): 477–500. They look like early chelicerates. Tanaka, Gengo et al 2013. Chelicerate neural ground pattern in a Cambrian great appendage arthropod. Nature 502 (7471): 364–367. Most of them lived in marine environments round the world from the lower to middle Cambrian. It looks like they were quite common then. However, one perfectly preserved specimen of Enalikter was found in the Silurian of Herefordshire (England).Dayantis, Harry 2014. The 425-million-year-old 'bottle brush' beastie.
