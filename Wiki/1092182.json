It lives in China, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. People have seen it between 103 and 2000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees in evergreen forests, forests with some bamboo plants, and near the ends of forests. People have also seen it on rubber and banana farms. The frog's tadpoles swim in pools of water that are not deep. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because they believe it lives in a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives, and fire can burn these forests. Also, human beings catch this frog to eat it or to use its body to make medicine. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
