 "text": "In the United States, a presidential nominating convention is held by each political party before a presidential election. They are held every four years, in the summer. At the convention, delegates (people who are selected to vote) choose the party's candidates for president and vice president. They also agree on the party's platform, a document that says the party's goals. Since 1972, the delegates have mostly been selected by primary elections in each state. == References == Category:United States presidential campaigns",
