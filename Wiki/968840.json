He worked as a jurist at the municipality of Sneek. From 1994 to 1998, he was a PvdA member of the city council of Heerenveen. In May 1998 he became alderman of the municipality of Heerenveen. When he just had started his second term in 2002, he was appointed mayor of the municipality of the island Terschelling in December 2002. In 2011 Visser attempted to get Terschelling back in passports. With his proposal he reached national attention. His proposal to declare one delivery room in Leeuwarden as island territory failed. In April 2013, Visser fell during a holiday in Turkey and broke five ribs. His recovery took longer than expected. His vestibular system turned out to be the cause. He stopped temporarily as a mayor. Rob Bats became acting mayor.Rob Bats waarnemer op Terschelling , RTV Noord, 5 June 2013 In September 2013, the municipality announced that Visser was not able to fulfill the position of mayor due to his health.Burgemeester Visser komt niet meer terug, www.skylgenet.nl, 27 september 2013 He officially retired on 1 December 2013.
