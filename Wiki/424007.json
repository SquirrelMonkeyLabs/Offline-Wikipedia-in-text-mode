He is currently wrestling for WWE on the SmackDown brand. He is a former two-time WWE Champion and was the leader of the stable The O.C. / The Club. He is also known for working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where he along with James Storm and Jeff Jarrett were the only wrestlers to have worked continuously for the promotion since its first broadcast on June 19, 2002. He was the first wrestler to complete the TNA Triple Crown Championship when he won the TNA X Division, NWA World Tag Team, and NWA World Heavyweight Championships. He is also the first wrestler to complete it more than once when he completed it five more times. Between WWE, TNA, and NJPW, he is a nine-time world champion. On December 8, 2013, it was announced by TNA that Styles' contract negotiations had failed. He was later released from the company and became a free agent on December 17. ==New Japan Pro Wrestling== On March 27, 2014, Styles signed a contract with New Japan Pro Wrestling. He debuted at Invasion Attack 2014 on April 6 where he attacked the IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada and hit his finishing move, the Styles Clash on him. Styles then said that he was the new leader of Bullet Club. This came after Prince Devitt, the former leader of Bullet Club, had to leave the company after losing a Loser Leaves Town match against his rival Ryusuke Taguchi. ==Championships== *All Access Wrestling **AAW Heavyweight Championship (one time) *Ballpark Brawl **Natural Heavyweight Championship (one time) *Christian Wrestling Federation/Christian Wrestling Entertainment **CWF/E Heavyweight Championship (one time) *Independent Professional Wrestling (Florida) **IPW Heavyweight Championship (one time) *Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South **IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship (one time) **Ted Petty Invitational (2004) *International Wrestling Cartel **IWC Super Indies Championship (two times) *Independent Wrestling Revolution **IWR King of The Indies Championship (one time) *Maximum Pro Wrestling **Max-Pro Cruiserweight Championship (one time) *Midwest Pro Wrestling **MPW Universal Heavyweight Championship (one time) *New Japan Pro Wrestling **IWGP Heavyweight Championship (two time) *New Korea Pro Wrestling Association **NKPWA Junior Heavyweight Championship (one time) *NWA Wildside **NWA Wildside Heavyweight Championship (one time) **NWA Wildside Television Championship (three times) *Pro Wrestling Guerrilla **PWG Championship (one time) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI Tag Team of the Year (2006) (with Christopher Daniels) *Pro Wrestling Report **Tag Team of the Year (2006) (with Christopher Daniels) *Ring of Honor **Pure Wrestling Championship (one time)1 **ROH Tag Team Championship (one time) (with Amazing Red) *Total Nonstop Action Wrestling **NWA World Heavyweight Championship (three time) **NWA World Tag Team Championship (four times) (with Jerry Lynn (one), Abyss (one) and Christopher Daniels (two)) **TNA Legends/Global/Television Championship (two times) **TNA World Heavyweight Championship (two times) **TNA World Tag Team Championship (two times) (with Tomko (one) and Kurt Angle (one)) **TNA X Division Championship (six times) **Bound For Glory Series (2013) **First TNA Triple Crown Champion (five times) **First TNA Grand Slam Champion (two times) **Feud of the Year (2005) (vs. Christopher Daniels) **Finisher of the Year (2003) (Styles Clash) **Match of the Year (2006) (with Christopher Daniels vs. Homicide and Hernandez at No Surrender, September 24, 2006) **Match of the Year (2009) (vs. Sting at Bound for Glory, October 18, 2009) **Mr. TNA (2003â€“2005) **Tag Team of the Year (2006) (with Christopher Daniels) **X Division Star of the Year (2004) *World Wrestling All-Stars **WWA International Cruiserweight Championship (one time) *World Wrestling Entertainment *WWE Championship (Two time) *WWE United States Championship (two time) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards **Best Flying Wrestler (2005) **Best Wrestling Maneuver (2003) (Styles Clash) **Worst Worked Match of the Year (2006) (TNA Reverse Battle Royal on TNA Impact!) **5 Star Match (2005) (vs. Samoa Joe and Christopher Daniels at Unbreakable on September 11) 1Ring of Honor no longer recognizes this reign following Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's split with ROH following the Rob Feinstein controversy. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website * * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American Christians Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from North Carolina Category:Sportspeople from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Total Nonstop Action Wrestling alumni Category:WWE wrestlers",
