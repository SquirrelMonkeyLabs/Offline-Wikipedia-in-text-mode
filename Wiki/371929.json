 "text": "Anxiolytics are drugs that are used for the treatment of anxiety, and anxiety- related disorders. The common drugs can be classified: *Benzodiazepines *Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, often abbreviated SSRIs *Azapirones *Barbiturates *Hydroxyzines *Pregabalin In addition to these drug classes, there are also certain plants that have such properties. Many of the drugs listed above have side-effects. For this reason, they are only available on prescription. Certain forms of therapy have also been used to treat anxiety disorders. == Mechanism == Anxiolytics are said to act on key biochemical messengers in the brain and eventually decrease the abnormal excitability. The biochemical messengers or binding sites are unevenly distributed in the brain, and also said to be associated with a GABA receptor and a chloride channel. == References == Category:Drugs used in psychiatry",
