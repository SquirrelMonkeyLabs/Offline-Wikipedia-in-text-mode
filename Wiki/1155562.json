It lives in Peru and Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that human beings have not changed too much. People have seen the frog between 274 and 800 meters above sea level in other places. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Yanachaga-Chemillén National Park, and Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul, Parque Nacional da Serra do Divisor, and Reserva Extrativista do Alto Juruá. Scientists think it could also live in San Matias- San Carlos Protected Forest. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans do change the places where it lives to make farms. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
