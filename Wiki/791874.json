 "text": "In crystallography, the cubic crystal system is a crystal system where the unit cell is in the shape of a cube. This is one of the most common and simplest shapes found in crystals and minerals. There are three main types of these crystals: * Primitive cubic * Body-centered cubic * Face-centered cubic ==Types== Name Description Picture Primitive cubic One atom at each corner of the cube. Body-centered cubic One atom at each corner of the cube, and one in the middle of the cube. Face-centered cubic One atom at each corner of the cube, and one in the middle of each face (side) of the cube. Category:Crystal systems",
