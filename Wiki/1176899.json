 "text": "A Sednoid in astronomy is a small object like a small solar system body, that goes around the Sun beyond Neptune's orbit, similar to the orbit of the dwarf planet Sedna. There are only three known Sednoids: * 90377 Sedna * 541132 Leleākūhonua * and 2012 VP113. These sednoids have very eliptical orbits and it could be Planet 9's gravity changing their orbits, or these object's were captured by the Sun. Category:Sednoids",
