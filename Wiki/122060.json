In the past, members of parliament from this area have done little or nothing to help in development and this has made the majority of people wary. At this time, the people have only just recently obtained a regular electricity supply to the village. They have also had various roads built connecting them to various parts, the earliest such roads were the Upper Dewal—Kohala Road and the Ghora Gali—Lora Road begun in 1964, and finished in 1968. Since then, there is a regular and strong local demand for more tourism infrastructure development and basic facilities. ==References== Category:Union councils of Abbottabad District",
