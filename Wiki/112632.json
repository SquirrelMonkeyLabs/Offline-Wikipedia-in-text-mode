 "text": "A Wordless Book is a Christian evangelistic device. Most believe that it was created by the famous London Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon. It is called a \"book\", as it is usually has pages, but it can also be shown on a single page or banner. == Color themes == Spurgeon’s concept only contained three colors: “first was black, the second was red, and the third was pure white” * Black: representing the “sinful state” of humanity “by nature”. Usually meaning the dark page. * Red: representing the blood of Jesus. * White: representing the “perfect righteousness which God has given to believers through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ His Son”.
