Meanwhile, their new 10,000-seat arena will be built on the site of the old Malley. This is Fribourg's last season in the current BCF Arena before it undergoes major renovations in the spring of 2017, which will last for about two years and increase the capacity from 6,500 to 8,500. The team should still be able to play in the arena during the renovations. ==Regular season== ==Playoffs== ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:2016 in ice hockey Category:2017 in ice hockey",
