The programme features the rabbit Hopla and his friends―the pig Onki, the bear Nina, and the kitten Lola. Each episode is about five minutes. Similar to its spiritual predecessor Tik Tak, the show is aimed at children between 0–2 years old and has no dialogue (the only dialogue is the show's name). The series was animated with Strata 3D. The show first aired on Ketnet, a Flemish television channel on 2 April 2000, and became popular soon afterward. Hopla has been aired in 31 countries (including Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Spain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States). In Belgium, Hopla's home entertainment titles have sold over 300,000 copies and their book-related merchandise has garnered sales close to 700,000. In Portugal, the show aired on public channel RTP2, with some dialogue added to briefly describe each scene's contents. 9 seasons and 180 episodes are aired until fall 2008. ==Episodes== == Broadcast == Hopla airs in the United States due to an exclusive multi-year distribution deal between Bert Smets Productions and NCircle Entertainment, a subsidiary of Alliance Entertainment, signed in 2007.
