 "text": "Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a Nintendo Switch compilation game. It was released on September 18, 2020 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Super Mario Bros. It contains Super Mario 64 (1996), Super Mario Sunshine (2002), and Super Mario Galaxy'_ (2007) with upscaled visuals. It had been made available in limited quantities as a retail edition and a digital edition that was available until March 31, 2021. The compilation and its name are based on Super Mario All-Stars, but it instead contains the first three 3D platformers of the Super Mario series. The compilation marks the first time Super Mario Sunshine has been re-released on another console. Changes from the original games include 720p resolution and rumble in Super Mario 64 (which was also featured in the Shindō Pak Taiō version), 1080p resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio in Super Mario Sunshine, and 1080p resolution and motion controls that mimic the Wii Remote in Super Mario Galaxy. All three games support docked, tabletop, and handheld modes, with Super Mario Galaxy having the player use the button to spin and emulate the pointer with the touch screen on handheld mode. Each game also modifies control graphics and tutorial text to correspond to the Nintendo Switch. Additionally, the game contains digital soundtracks of the three respective games, with 175 tracks in total.
