 "text": "Black separatism is a separatist political movement mainly in the United States. It propagates that those of African descent should have a cultural and economic development of their own. Black separatism comes from the idea of racial solidarity. It also implies that black people should organize themselves on the basis of their common skin color, their race, culture, and African heritage. There were a total of 255 black separatist groups recorded in the United States as of 2019. Black separatism in its purest form asserts that blacks and whites ideally should form two independent nations. Additionally, black separatists often seek to return to their original cultural homeland of Africa. This sentiment was spearheaded by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association in the 1920s. Black separatists generally think that black people are hindered in a white- dominated society. == References == Category:Political movements",
