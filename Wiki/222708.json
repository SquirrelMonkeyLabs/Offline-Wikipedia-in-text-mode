 "text": "The moment magnitude scale is a way to measure the power of earthquakes. It is the energy of the earthquake at the moment it happens. Like the similar and older Richter scale, it is logarithmic, with a base of ten. This means that an earthquake with a magnitude of 2 is ten times stronger than an earthquake with a magnitude of 1. Scale Number Earthquake Effect less than 3.5 This would be a very weak earthquake. People would not feel it, but it would be recorded by geologists. 3.5-5.4 Generally felt by people, but it rarely causes damage. 5.4-6.0 Will not cause damage to well-designed buildings, but can cause damage or destroy small or poorly-designed ones. 6.1-6.9 Can be destructive in areas up to about 100 kilometers across where people live. 7.0-7.9 Considered a \"major earthquake\" that causes a lot of damage. 8 or greater Large and destructive earthquake that can destroy large cities. ==Related pages== *Mercalli intensity scale *Richter scale == Other websites == *What is Richter Magnitude?
