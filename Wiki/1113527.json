 "text": "The Silverstoneia erasmios is a frog. It lives in Colombia. This frog lives on the ground in rainforests that have never been cut down and in gallery forest. People have seen this frog between 1040 and 2000 meters above sea level. People have seen them on trails in forests, in forest that has been cut down and is growing back, just outside forests, and near places where cows eat grass. The tadpoles swim in streams. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and because human beings cut down trees to make places for cows to eat grass. Scientists have seen the the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, but they do not know how many frogs it kills. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal sickness chytridiomycosis. At least two of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Natural Las Orquídeas and Parque Nacional Natural Tatamá. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
