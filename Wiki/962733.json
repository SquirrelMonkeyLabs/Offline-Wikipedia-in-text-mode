In it, Johnny Lawrence, who was the bully in the first movie is an adult and he hates the kid he bullied Daniel LaRusso who has now gotten rich from selling cars, so Johnny starts his own dojo called Cobra Kai based on the one where he learned karate to teach martial arts to a kid named Miguel Diaz so that he can fight back against his bullies. Daniel believes that Cobra Kai is evil because of what happened to him in The Karate Kid and The Karate Kid Part III. So Daniel and Johnny end up as enemies. == Season One == Johnny Lawrence is fired from his job for calling his boss a bitch. Johnny helps a teenager named Miguel by fighting his bullies for him but says he won’t teach Miguel karate. Then a teenage girl accidentally crashes her car into Johnny’s while driving with her friends but runs away after seeing Johnny. Johnny goes to Daniel LaRusso to get his car fixed and finds out that Daniel’s daughter Sam was in the car that hit his. So Johnny decides to teach Miguel by starting his own dojo called Cobra Kai and teaches Miguel everything that John Kreese taught him in The Karate Kid. Johnny gets more students but his son Robbie Keene hates him so he goes to Daniel to work for him. Daniel teaches Robbie karate the way Mister Miyagi taught him but then finds out that he’s Johnny’s son and is angry. Robbie decides to join the karate tournament and makes it almost to the end but Johnny’s student Hawk injures Robbie’s shoulder so he can’t fight. Daniel tells Robbie that Johnny Lawrence is Daniel’s enemy but isn’t Robbie’s. Daniel also says that the bad things Johnny did weren’t his fault since he was only doing what his Sensei taught him. Daniel also gets a doctor to help him so Robbie can get back in. Robbie fights Miguel so Miguel attacks Robbie’s shoulder and wins. == Season Two == After Miguel wins, Daniel LaRusso starts a dojo called Miyagi-Do. While Jonny starts to say that the kids at Cobra Kai should have honour. Then John Kreese comes back and convinces Johnny to let him teach karate at Cobra Kai. When the students at Cobra Kai become bullies, a lot of the kids go to Daniel LaRusso at Miyagi-Do and ask him to teach them. Johnny Lawrence falls in love with Miguel’s mother. All the Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai students get into a fight at their High School. Miguel fights Robbie and wins but then stops fighting because Johnny told him that sometimes he should show mercy. Then Robbie threw Miguel off a balcony and Robbie ended up in a coma. John Kreese convinced all the students at Cobra Kai to stop listening to Johnny Lawrence because Johnny was weak so they decided Kreese was their new Sensei. == Season Three == After Miguel’s coma ends, Johnny helps him learn to walk again. Sensei John Kreese breaks into Daniel LaRusso’s car company and puts a living snake in a car Daniel was trying to sell. Kreese’s students at Cobra Kai also attack a nerdy Miyagi-Do student named Demetri and breaks his arm. Daniel’s wife Amanda goes to the Cobra Kai dojo to talk to Kreese and he says that he believes that his students should have no mercy on the enemy. So Amanda slaps Kreese in the face. So Kreese goes to the police and gets a Restraining Order against her. Miguel convinced Johnny Lawrence to start his own dojo called Eagle Fang to teach people karate with honour. Daniel goes back to Japan and meets with Chozen from The Karate Kid Part II who teaches him how to kill an enemy. Johnny’s son Robbie decides that he hates his father enough to join Cobra Kai and joins Cobra Kai. Daniel and Johnny fight Kreese and Daniel almost kills Kreese. Then Kreese tells Jonny and Daniel that he’ll close his dojo Cobra Kai if either Miyagi-Do or Eagle Fang wins the next karate tournament. Daniel and Johnny then decide to work together so that can happen. John Kreese also remembers his origin story about how when he was young his mother killed herself and he got bullied so he learned to fight, fell in love and joined the army. He then went to Vietnam where he learned Tangsudo from his Captain and met Terry Silver. One of their friends got killed and then Kreese, Silver and the Captain were captured. The Viet Cong decided to have the Captain and Silver fight over a pit of snakes but Kreese said to fight him instead. The Captain told Kreese that Kreese’s girlfriend was dead. The American army came so the Viet Cong ran away and Kreese still pushed the Captain into the pit so the snakes could kill him and lied that the Viet Cong had done that. Kreese then became the new Captain. == Season Four == After Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence start working together, John Kreese calls Terry Silver and asks for his help in teaching at Cobra Kai. Silver says yes. Silver then tricks Johnny into coming to his dojo Cobra Kai and starts beating him up but Kreese stops him and is angry. So Silver tells a man nicknamed Stingray that he’ll let him join Cobra Kai again if he tells the police that Kreese was the one who beat him into a coma. Silver then beats him into a coma. Silver bribes the referee to let Cobra Kai win against Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang so that Johnny and Daniel have to close their dojos. Then the police come and arrest Kreese for attempted murder. Daniel calls Chozen from Japan to figure out how to get rid of Silver. Miguel goes to Mexico to look for his father and Johnny goes to Mexico to find Miguel. == Season Five == Terry Silver threatens Daniel so Daniel sends Chozen to spy on Silver but Silver finds out. So Daniel and Chozen find Mike Barnes from The Karate Kid Part III who tells them that Silver signed a contract giving him control of his dojo Cobra Kai. When Silver finds out Mike Barnes is looking for the contract, Silver burns down Mike Barnes’s store. Daniel tries to surrender to Silver but Silver beats Daniel up and says he’s not going to kill him yet since he wants him to suffer more. Johnny Lawrence gets Miguel’s mother pregnant. Johnny and Daniel re-open their dojo Miyagi-Fang because of how much more bullying there now is from Silver and Cobra Kai. Johnny, Chozen and Mike Barnes get drunk and break into Silver’s house to try to kill him. Silver stabs Chozen and fights Johnny and wins.
