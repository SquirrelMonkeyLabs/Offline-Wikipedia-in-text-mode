 "text": "An uninhabited region is a place where no people live. By 'uninhabited' is meant \"no one lives there permanently\". The difficult case is Antarctica, where there are permanent stations, but their staff do not stay permanently. In other places there may be visitors, and sometimes research teams visit for longer periods. ==List== * Antarctica\"Antarctica\" at CIA World Factbook (CIA) ; excerpt, \"no indigenous inhabitants, but there are both permanent and summer-only staffed research stations\"; retrieved 2013-4-19. * Antipodes Islands * Anzhu Islands * Ashmore and Cartier Islands\"Ashmore and Cartier Islands\" at CIA ; excerpt, \"no indigenous inhabitants\"; retrieved 2013-4-19. * Auckland Islands * Bajo Nuevo Bank * Baker Island\"Baker Island\" at CIA ; excerpt, \"no indigenous inhabitants\"; retrieved 2013-4-19. * Balleny Islands * Much of interior Nunavut * Big Major Cay * Bounty Islands * Bouvet Island\"Bouvet Island\" at CIA ; retrieved 2013-4-19. * Campbell Islands * Caroline Island * Clipperton Island * Coral Sea Islands\"Coral Sea Islands\" at CIA ; excerpt, \"no indigenous inhabitants\"; retrieved 2013-4-19. * Devon Island * De Long Islands * Elephant Island * Elobey Chico * Ernst Thälmann Island * Much of inland Greenland * Gough Island * Hans Island * Harmil * HashimaNussbaum, Louis-Frédéric.
