 "text": "==Timeline== Hurricane Gloria was an Atlantic tropical cyclone in September 1985. The storm was the first major storm to affect Long Island and New York directly since Hurricane Donna 25 years before. The storm started as a tropical depression on September 16; it became Tropical Storm Gloria on September 17. On September 18, it weakened back to a tropical depression. Two days later, it became a tropical storm again. After being a weak tropical cyclone for several days, on September 22, Gloria became a hurricane. It quickly became stronger on September 24; the next day, its winds peaked at 145 mph. A 2008 reanalysis later found the winds had been even stronger. On September 27, the hurricane struck eastern North Carolina as a Category 2 storm. It then moved up the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, the storm struck western Long Island, with winds of 85 mph. One hour after striking Long Island, it hit near Westport, Connecticut. Gloria moved northeast through Atlantic Canada. ==Damages== Damage from the storm was $900 million. The death toll from the storm was fourteen. ==Naming== The name Gloria was later retired and replaced with Grace. ==References== Category:Hurricanes in New York (state) Category:Hurricanes in New England Category:Hurricanes in North Carolina Category:Hurricanes in Virginia Category:1980s in North Carolina Category:1985 in New York (state) Category:1985 in Canada Category:Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Retired tropical cyclone names Category:1980s in weather",
