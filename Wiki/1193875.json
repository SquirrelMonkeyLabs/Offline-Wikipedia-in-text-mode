 "text": "Atelognathus is a group of frogs in the family Batrachylidae. People call them Patagonia frogs in English. They live in Patagonia, which is a place in Argentina and Chile. ==Species== There are seven species in the genus: * Atelognathus nitoi (Barrio, 1973) * Atelognathus patagonicus (Gallardo, 1962) * Atelognathus praebasalticus (Cei and Roig, 1968) * Atelognathus reverberii (Cei, 1969) * Atelognathus solitarius (Cei, 1970) Scientists used to think that Chaltenobatrachus grandisonae was really Atelognathus grandisonae, but they moved it into a group by itself. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
