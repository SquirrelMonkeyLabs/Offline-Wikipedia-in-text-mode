 "text": "William Hubbs Rehnquist (October 1, 1924 â€“ September 3, 2005) was an American lawyer, jurist, and a political figure. He was the 16th Chief Justice of the United States from 1986 until his death in 2005. Before becoming Chief Justice, he was an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1971 to 1986. Considered a conservative, Rehnquist favored a federalism under which the states meaningfully exercised governmental power. Under this view of federalism, the Supreme Court of the United States, for the first time since the 1930s, struck down an Act of Congress as exceeding federal power under the Commerce Clause. Rehnquist died on September 3, 2005. He was replaced by John Roberts as Chief Justice. == Books == * * * * ** Revised edition: ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1924 births Category:2005 deaths Category:American Lutherans Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Chief justices of the United States Category:Deaths from thyroid cancer Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Politicians from Milwaukee Category:Stanford University alumni Category:United States Supreme Court justices Category:Lawyers from Milwaukee",
