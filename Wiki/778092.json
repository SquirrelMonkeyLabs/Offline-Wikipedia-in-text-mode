 "text": "Folklore (styled in lowercase) is the eighth studio album by American recording artist Taylor Swift. It was released on July 24, 2020. Swift released the album as a surprise when her Lover fest stadium tour was canceled due to the 2019â€“20 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. She produced the album with her longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff, along with Aaron Dessner. It is Swift's first album with a Parental Advisory logo. It was released to all music streaming platforms. Swift announced the album the day before its release. On August 3, 2020, Billboard revealed that both folklore and its lead single, \"cardigan\", entered at the top of both the Billboard 200 album chart and Hot 100 singles chart. This marked Swift's sixth US number-one song and her seventh US number-one album. She became the first artist to have a song and album both debut at number one in the same week and is the only artist to have seven of her albums enter at number one. The songs \"the 1\" and \"exile\" featuring Bon Iver entered at numbers four and six of the Hot 100. == References == Category:Taylor Swift albums Category:2020 albums Category:Grammy Award-winning albums",
