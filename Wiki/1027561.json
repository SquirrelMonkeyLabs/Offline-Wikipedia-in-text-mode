 "text": "Risky Rides was an investigative documentary by NBC from Austin, Texas that looked into how the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles fixed loopholes regard temporary license plates. In 2018, Texas State Troopers began to see an increase in paper license plates on vehicles on their roads. When the COVID plague hit, Texas Department of Motor Vehicles offices were closed. Many people who have purchased an automobile needed a temporary registration to operate their vehicles on the road. As time went on, criminals opened dealerships for the sole purpose of printing and issuing tags. ==References== ==Other websites== *In depth coverage NBC Austin, Texas Category:NBC network series Category:Vehicle registration plates",
