 "text": "Coronary circulation is the movement of blood in the blood vessels that give blood containing oxygen to the heart muscle. Cardiac veins then take the blood after the heart muscle has used up the oxygen. The rest of the body relies on the heart pumping out blood rich with oxygen, so it is vital the heart is given a lot of oxygen to keep up with the demand from the body. == Structure == Coronary arteries give blood to the cardiac muscle. The left coronary artery distributes blood to the left side of the heart, the left atrium and ventricle, and the interventricular septum. The right coronary artery goes along the coronary sulcus and distributes blood to the right atrium, portions of both ventricles Category:Blood Category:Blood vessels Category:Anatomy of the cardiovascular system Category:Cardiology Category:Cardiovascular system",
