BE applies electrical, mechanical, optical, chemical, & other engineering principles to understand, modify, or control biological systems Biomedical engineers design, test, modify, recommend modification of, and evaluate all medical equipment used to interface or interact with the human body. In addition to these functions, clinical engineers usually supervise the biomedical equipment maintenance function within an environment of care. The medical devices include man-made hands, arms, and legs to replace lost ones and, also, Dialysis machines which clean the blood of a person with damaged kidneys. The beginning of the modern era of bioengineering was marked by the introduction of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970â€™s as (DNA produced artificially in the lab.) ==Other websites== * BioMedical Engineering OnLine * The Biomedical Engineering Interdepartmental Program (UCLA) ==Notes== Category:Engineering disciplines Category:Medicine",
