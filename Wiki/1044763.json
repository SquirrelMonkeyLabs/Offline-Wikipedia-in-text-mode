 "text": "The green-eyed bush frog (Raorchestes chlorosomma) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it exactly one place in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 1400 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests up in the mountains. These forests are called sholas. Sholas only grow in the Western Ghat mountains. People have also seen these frogs in tea farms and forests that grow back after they were cut down. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a small place and human beings continue to change these places, especially to make farms for tea, eucalyptus, and wattle. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. Because it lives high in mountains, the frog cannot move north when the weather gets hotter the way other animals could. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could makethis frog sick because it can make other frogs in Raorchestes sick, but they are not sure. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
