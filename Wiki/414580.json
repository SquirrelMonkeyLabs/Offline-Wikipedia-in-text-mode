Temperate rainforest often occurs in areas which have an oceanic moist climate. They are very notable for their lichen.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-66989115 In many ways, they are similar to tropical rainforests, but they are in areas that are not as hot.Alaback P.B. 1991.

This means that, under the trees, fungi, moss, ferns, shrubs with berries grow. Lichens are common in temperate rain forests. == Examples == * Hyrcanian forests on the south side of the Caspian Sea.
