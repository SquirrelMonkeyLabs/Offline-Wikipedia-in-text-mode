 "text": "Selly Oak is a mostly factory and home filled area in south-west Birmingham, England. Selly Oak ward, named after the area, has the neighbourhoods of: Bournbrook, Selly Park, and Ten Acres inside it. The nearby areas of Edgbaston and Harborne are to the north of the Bourn Brook, which was the former county borders, and to the south are Weoley, and Bournville. A local government is in-charge the four wards of Selly Oak, Billesley, Bournville and Brandwood. The same areas make the Birmingham Selly Oak political constituency, with their MP being Steve McCabe of the Labour Party. Selly Oak is connected to Birmingham by the Pershore Road (A441) and the Bristol Road (A38). The 2001 Population Census found that there were 25,792 people who lived in Selly Oak, with a population density of 4,236 people per km2 which was sometimes compared with 3,649 people per km2 in Birmingham. 15.9% of the population were people from races that had smaller populations in the UK compared with 29.6% in Birmingham. As the University of Birmingham is nearby, there are many students who live in the area. This can damage the figures about population that use the election registered voter record because some students are not allowed to vote, and some who are allowed do not register to vote. == References == Category:Areas of Birmingham Category:Neighborhoods",
