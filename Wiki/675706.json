 "text": "The Roots is an American hip hop band. It was formed in 1987 by Tariq \"Black Thought\" Trotter and Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2014, the Roots became the house band on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. They were also the house band on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon from 2009 to 2014. The band is one of the few hip hop groups to use mostly live instruments instead of sampling and to produce electronically. They have released several albums that are very popular within the genre. Things Fall Apart is considered by many to be their best. ==Band members== Current members * Black Thought – rap and singing vocals (1987–present) * Questlove – drums, backing rap vocals, beatboxing (1987–present) * Kamal Gray – keyboards, backing rap vocals (1994–present) * Captain Kirk Douglas – guitars, singing vocals (2003–present) * Tuba Gooding, Jr. (Damon Bryson) – sousaphone, tuba (2007–present) * James Poyser – keyboards (2009–present) * Ray Angry – keyboards (2010–present) * Mark Kelley – bass, synthesizer bass, moog (2011–present) * Ian Hendrickson-Smith – flutes, saxophones (2015–present) * Dave Guy – trumpet (2015–present) * Stro Elliot – beatbox, percussion, sampling, tambourine, Ableton, HandSonic, SPD-SX, finger drumming, keyboards (2017–present) * Jeremy Ellis – beatbox, sampling, Maschine, Arcade machine sampler, midi fighter, finger drumming (2014–present) Former members * Malik B. – rap vocals (1987–1999; died 2020) * Josh 'Rubberband' Abrams – bass (1992–1994) * Kenyatta 'Kid Crumbs' Warren – rap vocals (1993) * Scott Storch – keyboards (1993–1995) * Nikki Yeoh – keyboards (1994) * Hub – bass (1994–2007; died 2021) * Rahzel – beatboxing (1995–2001) * Dice Raw – rap vocals (1995–2001) (frequent collaborator with the band) * Scratch – beatboxing (1996–2003) * F.
