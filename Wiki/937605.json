 "text": "Sphaenorhynchus mirim is a frog. Scientists have seen it in one place: Fazenda Gemada in Brazil. The adult male frog is 15.7 â€“ 18.2 mm long from nose to rear end. The frog's head is wider than it is long. This frog is bright green in color with white spots on its back. It has some yellow color on its toes. Scientists think this frog is sexually mature early. The tadpoles grow reproductive organs before they become frogs. Scientists think this is so they can make young soon after becoming frogs. This frog lives in the same places as Dendropsophus elegans, Dendropsophus minutus, and Scinax alter. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
