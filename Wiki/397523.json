It was worn on a person's head, with a screen sitting in front of the eyes that displayed information like a smartphone. It was instructed through natural language voice commands. The device also had a touch pad on the side. The plan was to make them attached to regular eyeglasses and sunglasses. On March 15, 2023, Google discontinued the Google Glass. ==References== Category:Google Category:Computers",
