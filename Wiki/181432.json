 "text": "The word classicism, in the arts, is used when talking about art from the Ancient Greeks and Romans and their influence. The art of classicism often involves a thoughtful approach to the arts in which beauty and form is admired, rather than passion or any kind of exaggeration. Classicism influenced several periods in European history, especially the Italian Renaissance, Age of Reason, the Age of Enlightenment and some movements in Modernism. Classicism can apply to painting, sculpture, architecture, music, dance, literature or philosophy. == Related pages == * Neoclassicism * Classical music * Classical music period == Other websites == * , explains the difference between Classicism and Baroque Category:Art movements",
