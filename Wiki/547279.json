It is the 29th highest lake in the world (and the 10th highest in South America). The lake is near the volcanos Parinacota () and Pomerape (). It is part of the Lauca National Park, in the Putre comuna. The lake is at about to the east of the town of Putre and about to the west of the border with Bolivia. In the lake and streams nearby, there are some small fish that are endemic to the lake basin: pencil catfish, Trichomycterus chungaraensis, and Orestias chungarensis.
