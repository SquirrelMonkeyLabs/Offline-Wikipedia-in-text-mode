 "text": "The video service TikTok was banned in the United States on January 19, 2025, due to data collection and influence operations by China. The ban took effect after refusal to sell TikTok before the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. On the day before the deadline, TikTok closed its services in the United States. President Trump signaled that he would grant a 90-day extension to TikTok and the ban was lifted. TikTok users began planning on switching apps incase the ban went through. Many TikTok users began switching to the app Xiaohongshu in protest of the ban. On January 18, 10:30 p.m. EST, TikTok closed services in the United States. Users received an error message informing them that the service is no longer accessible in the US. Hours after the closure, Donald Trump indicated that he would issue an order \"to extend the period of time before the law takes effect\". On January 19, TikTok began restoring service. In a post on X, they stated that Trump provided \"assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties\". ==References== Category:Presidency of Donald Trump Category:Articles with excerpts",
