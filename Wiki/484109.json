 "text": "An airport lounge is a members-only rest area usually owned by an airline (or operated by several airlines). Anyone who pays the membership fee can join. Airport lounges are designed mainly for business travelers. Most offer private meeting rooms and other business services and conveniences. They offer comfortable seating, food, beverages (often an open bar) and free Wi-Fi. Most major airlines have one or more lounges in the major airports they serve. The first airport lounge was owned by American Airlines. It opened in 1939 at LaGuardia Airport. == References == Category:Airports",
