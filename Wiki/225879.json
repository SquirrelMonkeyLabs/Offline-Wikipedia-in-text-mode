During the Greek-Turkish war in 1922 the Greek people left from there and they went to Greece. So, the club came to Greece to the Athenian suburb Nea Smyrni. The colours of the club are red and blue. Panionios has won two Greek cups. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official football club website Category:Greek football clubs Category:1890 establishments in Europe Category:Ä°zmir Category:Thessaloniki Category:Establishments in Greece",
