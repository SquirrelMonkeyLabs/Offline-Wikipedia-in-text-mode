 "text": "The Crump tree frog (Dendropsophus brevifrons) is a frog that lives in Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador. The adult male frog is 18 to 21 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 23 mm long. This frog looks for food at night. The eggs are bright yellow and look like the spots on the female frog's legs. The female frog lays eggs on the tops of green leaves above water. After the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. Beetles and grasshoppers eat about half the eggs before they can hatch. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
