 "text": "The Suez Crisis was the invasion of Egypt by Israel, the United Kingdom and France to regain control over the Suez Canal and remove then Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who nationalized the Suez Canal Company and Egypt's oil industry. Before 1956, the Suez Company owned the Suez Canal, a private corporation mostly owned by British and French investors. In 1956, Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Canal. In other words, he took it away from the Suez Company and put the Egyptian government in control. Israel, the United Kingdom, and France invaded Egypt. == References == === Sources === * Bromberger, Merry and Serge Secrets of Suez Sidgwick & Jackson London 1957 (translated from French Les Secrets de l'Expedition d'Egypte by James Cameron) * Doran, Michael.
