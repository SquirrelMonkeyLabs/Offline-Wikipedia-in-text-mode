 "text": "Hutts are a slug-like species from Star Wars. Hutts are very large in size and are very heavy. They are most well known as crime lords and run the crime worlds of Star Wars. Hutts control their own area of the galaxy known as \"Hutt Space\" which the Hutts have controlled for thousands of years. Hutts come from the swampy crime world of Nal Hutta but are all over the galaxy. Jabba the Hutt is the most well known member of the species. The species first appeared in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi and have also appeared in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (albeit through the special edition) and Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. ==References== Category:Star Wars species",
