 "text": "Canning Town station is a major inter-modal transport interchange in East London. It is served by London Underground's Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), as well as being served by local buses operated on behalf of London Buses. It is in Travelcard Zone 3. == Future developments == The North London Line platforms will be redeveloped as part of the extension of the DLR from Canning Town to Stratford International via West Ham, which would see a more frequent service to Stratford, although passengers to NLL destinations beyond will have to change. On the DLR City Airport extension there is a station planned south-east of here called Thames Wharf, depending mainly on the regeneration of the area. == Gallery == Image:Canningtowntubestation1.JPG|Eastbound Jubilee Line platform looking north Image:Canning Town stn Jubillee eastbound look south.JPG|Eastbound Jubilee line platform looking south Image:CanningtownDLRplatform.jpg|Eastbound DLR platform looking south Image:Canning Town stn DLR eastbound look north.JPG|Eastbound DLR platform looking north Image:CanningtownDLR.jpg|Interior of the bus station Image:Canning Town stn tube roundel.JPG|Jubilee line roundel, westbound platform Image:Canning Town stn DLR signage.JPG|DLR signage, westbound platform == References == == Other websites == *Docklands Light Railway website - Canning Town station page Current Services Future Services Category:London Travelcard zone 3 Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham",
