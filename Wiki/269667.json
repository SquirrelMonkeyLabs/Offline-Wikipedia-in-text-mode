The Maryland in Liberia colony remained apart, as the state colonization society did not want anyone else to be able to trade goods. On 2 February 1841, Maryland-in-Africa became the State of Maryland.

It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro Rivers. However, it would last just three years as its own country. Soon afterwards, local tribes, including the Grebo and the Kru, attacked the State of Maryland. Unable to defend itself, Maryland asked Liberia, its more powerful neighbor, for help. President Roberts sent military help, and an alliance of Marylanders and Liberian militia troops stopped the local tribesmen. However, it was now clear that the Republic of Maryland could not survive on its own, and 18 March 1857 Maryland was added by Liberia, and became known as Maryland County. ==References== *Freehling, William H., The Road to Disunion: Volume I: Secessionists at Bay, 1776-1854 Retrieved March 12, 2010 * Hall, Richard, On Afric's Shore: A History of Maryland in Liberia, 1834-1857 * Latrobe, John H.
