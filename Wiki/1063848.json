 "text": "In Islam, homosexuality is generally considered as forbidden by every major scholar in both the Shia and Sunni schools of Islam. The Qur'an mentions homosexual activity in Qur'an 7Àê80, and all of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad agreed that homosexuality should of been punished by execution based on Sunan Abu Dawood 4462 in Sunni sources. However, the companions of Muhammad disagreed on how to execute homosexuals, but the punishments were burning, flogging, stoning, and one companion called Ibn Abbas said that they should be pushed off of a tall building or cliff. However, in the Shia religion, no punishment for homosexuality is mentioned in the hadith but is still considered haram based off of Qur'an 7:80 by the majority of Usuli scholars such as Ali al-Sistani and Ali Khamenei. Some followers of the Shia religion such as followers of the Akhbari madh'hab who reject the Qur'an based off of a hadith within Kitab al-Kafi which is regarded as one of the most authentic hadith collections within the Shia religion.Kitab Al-Kafi (v.2 p. 634) thaqalayn.net Retrieved 21 March 2024 == References == Category:Homosexuality Category:Islam",
