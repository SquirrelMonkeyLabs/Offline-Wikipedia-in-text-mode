The statue consists of four Asiatic lions back to back, with the two-dimensional emblem showing three lions. An emblem based upon the Lion Capital of Ashoka was first adopted as the emblem of the Dominion of India in December 1947. The current version of the emblem was officially adopted on 26 January 1950, the day India became a republic. ==References== India Category:National symbols of India",
