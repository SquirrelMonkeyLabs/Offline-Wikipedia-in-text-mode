During the dictatorship of Muammar al-Gaddafi the flag was changed twice and it was just a plain field of green. It was unique for being the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design, emblems, coat of arms, or any other details. It was adopted on 11 November 1977. ==Related pages== *Flag of Libya (1977â€“2011) == References == Category:National symbols of Libya Libya Category:1951 establishments Category:1950s establishments in Africa Category:20th-century establishments in Libya Category:1969 disestablishments Category:2011 establishments in Africa",
