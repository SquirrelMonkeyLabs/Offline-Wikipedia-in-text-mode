 "text": "Acetic anhydride is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is the acid anhydride of acetic acid. == Production == Acetic anhydride can be produced by adding a molecule of carbon monoxide to methyl acetate (carbonylation). This is analogous to the production of acetic acid from methanol in the Monsanto process, but is more complex in practice because of changes in byproducts and a need for anhydrous (water-free) conditions. == Sources == Category:Carboxylic acid anhydrides",
