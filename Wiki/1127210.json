The male frog's male organs are white in color. ==Name== Scientists named this frog anthracinus for anthracite coal because the frog's stripe are as black as coal. ==Home== This frog lives in a special kind of forest called paramo and in other forests on mountains where there is water in the air. People have seen this frog on bromeliads plants and under dead trees and rocks near streams. People have seen this frog between 2185 and 3860 meters above sea level. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks, for example Parque Nacional Sangay, Parque Nacional Rio Negro Sopladora, Parque Nacional Cajas, and Siete Iglesias. ==Young== Scientists think that the female frog lays eggs on the ground and that the male frogs carry the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People cut down trees where the frog lives to make farms and other things that people need. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
