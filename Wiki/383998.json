It has been held by Labor except between the 1992 by-election and the 1996 federal election. During this time it was held by independent Phil Cleary. The seat was held by Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The 1992 by-election is remarkable for a number of reasons. It was caused by Bob Hawke's retirement from parliament. A record 22 people stood for election. It was won by an independent, Phil Cleary. However he was on unpaid leave from the state education system and the Australian Constitution forbids people employed by the government from standing for election. No replacement by- election was held as the court decision which threw out the results was made shortly before a general election was due. ==Election results== ==References== *Division of Wills – Australian Electoral Commission ==Other websites== * Kelvin Thomson's website Wills Category:1949 establishments in Australia",
