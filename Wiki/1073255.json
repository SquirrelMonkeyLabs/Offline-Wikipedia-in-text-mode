 "text": "Migration is an American animated adventure comedy movie. It was made using computers and produced by Illumination, then released by Universal Pictures. Benjamin Renner directed it, with Guylo Homsy as co-director and Mike White as the writer. The story was created by White and Renner. The film features the voices of Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Keegan-Michael Key, Awkwafina, David Mitchell and Danny DeVito. In February 2022, Illumination revealed their movie \"Migration\" and appointed Renner, Homsy, and White as the director, co- director, and writer. Renner, who is experienced in directing traditional animated films, was assigned the job of adjusting his uncomplicated drawing style for a computer-animated film. By bringing Renner on board, Chris Meledandri, the CEO and producer of the studio, aimed to emphasize the filmmaker's vision for the project, diverging from Illumination's recent films. John Powell will create the music, marking his second collaboration with Illumination after The Lorax (2012). ==Release== The movie was released in the United States on 22 December 2023 and 2 February 2024 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was initially planned to be released on 30 June 2023, but was postponed to the current date. == References == Category:2023 movies Category:2023 animated movies Category:2023 adventure movies Category:2023 comedy movies Category:American animated movies Category:American adventure movies Category:American comedy movies Category:Illumination movies Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Movies set in the Bahamas Category:Universal Pictures movies",
