The Aleut language is an endangered language because fewer people are speaking it. The Aleut are trying to teach the language to others and encourage them to use it so it will not die out. == Alphabet == Aleut uses two alphabets, the Latin alphabet (the ABCs) and the Cyrillic alphabet. == Grammar == In Aleut, new words are created by adding suffixes to a base word called a stem.
