 "text": "A Dangerous Woman is a 1993 romantic drama movie. It was partly based on the same-named novel by Mary McGarry Morris. It was released three weeks before Christmas in 1993. ==The plot== Martha Horgan (played by Debra Winger) is a cognitively troubled woman trying to have a normal life. While working at a local dry cleaner, she is accused of stealing money from the cash register. Martha is then fired. But she believes and thinks that the thefts were done by the boyfriend of her colleague Birdie. The boyfriend's name is Getso. Martha is later depressed and returns to the house of her Aunt Frances (played by Barbara Hershey). She discovers a handyman named Mackey (played by Gabriel Byrne) is hired to repair the home's porch. Aunt Frances plans an event for a local politician. The politician's wife was angry following her husband's affair with Frances. So she drove right into the porch and damaged it on purpose. Mackey is nice with Martha. He defends her against Getso because Getso is insulting and bullying her. Mackey smashes the windshield of Getso's van. But then one night Mackey returns home while drunk to Martha's home, lets himself in and has sex with her while she's on her sofa. Mackey later has sex with Aunt Frances (who happens being also drunk that night). ==The cast== Actor Role Debra Winger Martha Horgan - Niece Barbara Hershey Frances Beechum - Aunt Gabriel Byrne Colin 'Mac' Mackey - Alcoholic Handyman Laurie Metcalf Anita Bell - Steve's Wife John Terry Steve Bell - Politician Maggie Gyllenhaal Patsy Bell - Steve's Daughter Jake Gyllenhaal Edward (as Jacob Gyllenhaal) Chloe Webb Birdie Drusser - Martha's Friend David Strathairn Getso - Petty Crook Jan Hooks Make-up Saleslady Richard Riehle John - Drycleaning Boss ==Reception== Janet Maslin of The New York Times liked the movie and some of the direction of the cast.
