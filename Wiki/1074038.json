 "text": "The Greek junta or Regime of the Colonels was a right-wing military dictatorship that controlled Greece from 1967 to 1974. On 21 April 1967, a group of colonels removed the caretaker government a month before elections that Georgios Papandreou and his political party, Centre Union, would probably win. The dictatorship was anti-communist and it restricted civil liberties. It put many people to jail and tortured them. Many of the dictators' political enemies were sent into exile. From 1967 to 1973, the junta's leader was Georgios Papadopoulos. From 1973 to 24 July 1974, Dimitrios Ioannidis was its leader. He lost control of the Greek state after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. When the junta lost, the Metapolitefsi (, meaning \"regime change\") started. Greece's political system changed to democracy and the Third Hellenic Republic began. It has been said that the junta was very much influenced by the CIA. == Notes == == References == == Other websites == * Barrett, Matt. \"The Rise of the Junta in Greece\". * Barrett, Matt. \"November 17, Cyprus and the Fall of the Junta\".
