Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8. The successor to Windows Server 2012, called Windows Server 2012 R2, was released along with Windows 8.1 in October 2013. A service pack, formally designated Windows Server 2012 R2 Update, was released in April 2014.http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/08/05/august- updates-for-windows-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-r2/ ==History== Windows Server 2012, codenamed \"Windows Server 8\", is the sixth release of Windows Server family of operating systems developed concurrently with Windows 8.
