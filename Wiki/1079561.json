His fame was so great that the princes descended from him, the O’Briens, subsequently ranked as one of the chief dynastic families of the country. Brian obtained the name \"Bóruma\" after his death. It refers to the hillfort where he was raised, and is often shortened to \"Boru\". In life, he was named \"Brian mac Cennétig\", referring to his father Cennétig.https://www.dib.ie/biography/brian-borama- boruma-boru-a0954 Brian became High King of Ireland by fighting both other Celtic warlords and Vikings.
