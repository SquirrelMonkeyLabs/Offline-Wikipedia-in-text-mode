Because he was born in England, he used the word 'colour' instead of 'color'. Reid was well known in New York's jazz music community because he played music with Ronald Shannon Jackson. From 1984 to 1986, Living Colour had many different members. These members were musicians such as Jerome Harris, Geri Allen and Pheeroan akLaff. The band had many different singers. Sometimes, Reid would sing as well. During this time, the band made music that sounded very different than its studio albums. The band made a song named \"Funny Vibe\". This song would be put on Vivid in 1988. === The band gets popular (1986–1991) === In 1986, the band had four members: singer Corey Glover, guitarist Vernon Reid, bassist Muzz Skillings, and drummer Will Calhoun.
