Washington, DC ==Controversies== ===Views on the Holocaust=== Chodakiewicz has promoted controversial views about the Holocaust, including: * \"Many Jews collaborate[d] with Soviet Communists\" * \"Jews [are] more likely to kill Poles after World War II\" * For these \"reasons\", the murder of Jewish survivors returning to their homeland * * * * was \"not antisemitic\" Chodakiewicz also appeared in traditionalist Catholic media, such as Radio Maryja, promoting conspiracy theories about Jews. In a 2001 interview by this radio, he accused \"Jewish memoirists\" of \"bragging about\" the shooting of hundreds of Poles by \"Jewish partisans\". Despite Chodakiewicz's record of antisemitic writings, US President George W. Bush made him a member of the oversight board of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. He served until 2010. ==Reception== Many historians, including Princeton University professor Jan T. Gross and University of Toronto professor Piotr Wróbel criticized Chodakiewicz, saying that Chodakiewicz had written several pieces that trivialized the Holocaust and the violent antisemitism of many Polish Catholics. In his 2003 book After the Holocaust: Polish Jewish Relations in the Wake of World War II, he underestimated the number of Jews that Polish Catholics had killed in post-war pogroms. * * * * * * He also accused Holocaust victims of being \"Jewish Communists\". Jan Grabowski, a chair professor of history at University of Ottawa, criticized Chodakiewicz's views about the Holocaust victims as \"copious victim blaming\". Other historians, including David Engel, Joanna Michlic and Laurence Weinbaum, shared the same opinion as Grabowski. In particularly, Weinbaum wrote, referring to the Polish nationalists being upset with the revelation of the Jedwabne pogrom. ==Related pages== * Jan Żaryn * Richard Lukas ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Historians Category:American people",
