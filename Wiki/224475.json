The rulers were addressed by the people as Raje. Some clans of the Maratha Caste King put the name Raje before their original clan name. Examples of these include RajeBhosale, RajeShirke, RajeMahadik, RajeNimbalkar and RajeMane. In states like Rajasthan, Rajput community chiefs are known by the titles that include Maharawal, Rana and Maharana. These mean the same thing as Raje or Maharaja. == Related pages == * Raja Category:Titles Category:Indian royalty",
