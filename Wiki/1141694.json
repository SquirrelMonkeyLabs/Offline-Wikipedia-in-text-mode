 "text": "Adi Wala Khali is the Algerian version of the show Deal or No Deal . The show was first launched in 2015 on Echourouk TV, presented by Sofiane Dani . \"أدّي ولا خلي\" أول مسابقة ألعاب بمبالغ ضخمة في تاريخ البرامج الجزائرية == Program idea == The game is based on approximately 22 participants. One participant leaves every day, with another participant coming in to replace him the next day. This latter participant says the word “stop” to the computer, and another participant leaves, and so on. The latter plays on certain amounts of money from the smallest to the largest amount during four rounds. In the first round, he opens six boxes and during the first three boxes he must open the Bounis box or the gift box containing an amount of 250,000 DZD to receive the gift that changes every few months. After opening the six boxes, the bank offers him a certain amount or a change in the box in exchange for his box. In the second round, he opens three boxes each time, with the bank continuing to call him between each three boxes to offer him another amount or a change. In the third stage, he opens two boxes before the bank calls again, so that in the end there are two boxes left, the first with him and the second with another participant. The participant must take the largest number of amounts available to outdo the bank. In the end, the amount won by the participant is shared with the SMS sender who sends them throughout the program. == References == == Other websites == * On Facebook Category:Algerian culture Category:Television game shows Category:2015 television series debuts",
