In the 2002-03 season, he won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award after averaging 15.2 points, 3.4 assists, and 3.0 rebounds per game while coming off the bench.

He had a strong first step, was quick on his feet, and had an effective mid-range jump shot. He could get to the basket and finish in traffic, and was also capable of hitting the three-pointer. * Energy: Known for his hustle and energy, Jackson played with intensity, often providing a spark when he came off the bench. * Defense: While not known for being an elite defender, Jackson’s quickness and tenacity allowed him to be a solid defender, especially in terms of playing the passing lanes and pressuring opposing ball handlers. === Post-Playing Career: === After retiring as a professional basketball player in 2009, Jackson became a basketball coach.
