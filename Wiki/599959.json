 "text": "India is a country in southern Asia. With over 1.3 billion people, India is the most populous democracy in the world. It is a federal constitutional republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 28 states and 8 union territories. All states, as well as the union territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments, both patterned on the Westminster model. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the centre through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts. The state and union territory capitals are sorted according to no legislative and judicial capitals. The administrative capital is where the executive government offices are located, the legislative capital is where the state assembly convenes, and the judicial capital is the location of the state or territorial High Courts. Union territories are marked with a dagger (). ==List== State or union territory Administrative capitals Legislative capitals Judiciary capitals Year capital was established The Former capital Andaman and Nicobar Islands Port Blair Port Blair Kolkata 1955 Calcutta (1945–1955) Andhra Pradesh Visakhapatnam Amaravati Kurnool With high court benches in Visakhapatnam and Amaravati 1956 Kurnool (1953-1956) Hyderabad(1956-2014) Amaravati(2014-2020) Arunachal Pradesh Itanagar Itanagar Guwahati 1986 Assam Dispur Guwahati Guwahati 1975 Shillong (1874–1952) Bihar Patna Patna Patna 1912 Chandigarh Chandigarh — Chandigarh 1966 — Chhattisgarh Naya Raipur Raipur Bilaspur 2000 — Dadra and Nagar Haveli Silvassa — Mumbai 1945 Mumbai (1954–1961) Panaji (1961–1987) Daman and Diu Daman — Mumbai 1987 Ahmedabad (1961–1963) Panaji (1963–1987) National Capital Territory of Delhi New Delhi New Delhi New Delhi 1931 — Goa Panaji Porvorim Mumbai 1961 Panaji (1961–1987) Gujarat Gandhinagar Gandhinagar Ahmedabad 1960 Ahmedabad (1960–1970) Haryana Chandigarh Chandigarh Chandigarh 1966 — Himachal Pradesh Shimla Dharamshala (W/2nd) Shimla (Summer) Dharamsala(Winter) Shimla 1971 2017 Bilaspur (1950–1956) Jammu and Kashmir Srinagar (Summer) Jammu (Winter) Srinagar (Summer) Jammu (Winter) Srinagar (Summer) Jammu (Winter) 1947 — Jharkhand Ranchi Ranchi Ranchi 2000 Karnataka Bengaluru Bengaluru Bengaluru 1940 (Mysore) Kerala Thiruvananthapuram Thiruvananthapuram Kochi 1956 Lakshadweep Kavaratti Kavaratti Kochi 1956 Madhya Pradesh Bhopal Bhopal Jabalpur 1956 Nagpur (1861–1956) Maharashtra Mumbai Nagpur (W/2nd) Mumbai (S+B) Nagpur (W) Mumbai 1818 1960 — Manipur Imphal Imphal Imphal 1947 — Meghalaya Shillong Shillong Shillong 1970 — Mizoram Aizawl Aizawl Guwahati 1972 — Nagaland Kohima Kohima Guwahati 1963 — Odisha Bhubaneswar Bhubaneswar Cuttack 1948 Cuttack (1936–1948) Puducherry Puducherry Puducherry Chennai 1954 Madras (1948–1954) Punjab Chandigarh Chandigarh Chandigarh 1966 Rajasthan Jaipur Jaipur Jodhpur 1950 — Sikkim Gangtok Gangtok Gangtok 1890 — Tamil Nadu Chennai Chennai Chennai 1956 Telangana Hyderabad Hyderabad Hyderabad 2014 — Tripura Agartala Agartala Agartala 1956 — Uttar Pradesh Lucknow Lucknow Prayagraj 1938 — Uttarakhand Dehradun Dehradun Nainital 2000 — West Bengal Kolkata Kolkata Kolkata 1947 ==Explanatory notes== ==Citations== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * * Legislative bodies in India Category:India-related lists Category:Capital cities in India",
