 "text": "Pharisees were Jewish leaders who composed and enforced religious law, sometimes hypocritically, at a certain period in Jewish history. At times, the Pharisees were a political party, a social movement, and a school of thought. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundation for Rabbinic Judaism. The term 'Judaism' today almost always refers to Rabbinic Judaism. Paul of Tarsus, disciple of Jesus, was a Pharisee before he became a Christian. == Other websites == *Pharisees: Oxford Quick Reference *Jewish Encyclopedia: Pharisees Category:Ancient Israel and Judah",
