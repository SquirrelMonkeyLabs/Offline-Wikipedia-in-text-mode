 "text": "N+ is the news division of Grupo Televisa, which produces national and local news for Televisa's TV channels and local stations across Mexico. It is headed by Leopoldo Gómez, the Vice President of News for Televisa. ==History== After the last broadcast of 24 Horas with Jacobo Zabludovsky on January 20, 1998, Televisa restructured its news division. From 1998 to 2000, Jacobo's son Abraham Zabludovsky hosted its 10 p.m. successor, simply titled Las Noticias; Joaquín López-Dóriga took over from 2000 to 2016. Other notable personalities who have hosted Televisa newscasts include Lolita Ayala, Guillermo Ortega, Adela Micha, Carlos Loret de Mola and Víctor Trujillo (\"Brozo\"). ==Programs== ===National newscasts=== Most of Televisa's national newscasts air on its Las Estrellas network, covering key dayparts. Since 2016, Televisa's flagship 10 p.m. newscast, known as 10 En Punto, has been helmed by Denise Maerker. Its other weekday programs include Despierta (Wake Up), hosted by Danielle Dithurbide, and Al Aire with Paola Rojas in the mornings. The afternoon newscast El Noticiero con Karla Iberia Sánchez was moved from Las Estrellas to Nu9ve in 2018; it is that channel's only regular news program. The move left Las Estrellas without an afternoon newscast for the first time in decades. ===N+ FORO=== In 2010, Televisa launched N+ FORO, a channel devoted exclusively to news, analysis and documentary programming. N+ FORO airs in Mexico City on XHTV-TDT (Channel 4) and as a subchannel of 21 additional Televisa transmitters in large cities. ===Regional newscasts=== Outside of its national news output, Televisa produces local news at each of its Televisa Regional stations; local newscasts, under such titles as El Noticiero, Las Noticias and Notivisa. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1998 establishments Category:News media Category:Mexican culture",
