 "text": "Zatanna is a comic book series that started in 2010. It's about a character named Zatanna. An American writer named Paul Dini and a French artist named Stephane Roux created it. DC Comics, the company that makes the comics, released the first one in May 2010, and the last one came out in August 2011. They put them together in two books called Zatanna: Mistress of Magic and Zatanna: Shades of the Past. The series was supposed to start in 2007, but Paul Dini had to wait until 2010 because he was busy. The comics were published in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The series ended after sixteen comics because DC Comics wanted to start everything again to get more young readers. After that, Zatanna became part of other comics like Justice League Dark, which had darker and more adult themes. ==References== Category:American comic books Category:Pages using citations with accessdate and no URL",
