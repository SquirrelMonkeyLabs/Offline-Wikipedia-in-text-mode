This fort was captured by the Dutch in 1642 when they drove the Spanish from the island. the historic site, although the actual castle we see today is the Dutch fortress Fort Antonio. Fort Antonio is a two story cube- shaped building, measuring 15.25 meters on all four sides while standing 13 meters tall. The deep foundation, thick walls, and mix of stones and bricks provide the fort with strong and effective fortification. Following the Opium War, the British government leased the fort from the Qing government for their consulate. Modifications were made accordingly for consular business. To accommodate the needs of the consul's family, the consular residence was then built on the eastern side of the fort. The Former British Consular Residence, an elegant Victorian-styled house blended with some Chinese elements, was built in 1891 after the British government leased the fort. In 1980, the Taiwanese government retrieved the land from the British, and the site of the residence became the Tamsui Historical Museum in 2005. ==Tamsui Church== The original church building, which later became the birth place of the Northern Taiwanese Presbyterian Church, was built by Reverend George Leslie Mackay to serve the church's growing followers, carry out religious services, and give medical care and educational seminars. The current Tamsui Church building, with pointed pillars, arched windows and strengthened brick work, was designed and supervised by Reverend G.W. Mackay in 1932 after his father, Rev. George Leslie Mackay, passed away. With these unique Eastern and Western features, the fort and its surrounding buildings have been listed by the Ministry of Culture as one of the 18 potential World Heritage Sites in the country == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Taiwan Category:17th- century buildings and structures",
