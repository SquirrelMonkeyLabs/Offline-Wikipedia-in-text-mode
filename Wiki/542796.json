 "text": "The Balto-Slavic language group is a hypothetical group made up of the Baltic and Slavic languages. They are part of this family group because it is claimed by some Germanic and Slavic linguists that these two language groups share some similarities involving the linguistic traits of the two language families. However, these claims are not universally accepted. Some scholars claim they are two different decendants of the wider Proto-Indo-European (PIE) langauge family. ==Distribution== The Balto-Slavic languages are mainly spoken in areas of eastern, northern and southern parts of Europe. The Balto-Slavic languages are daughter languages of the now extinct PIE. There are only two Baltic languages spoken today: Lithuanian and Latvian. ==Today== Some of Balto-Slavic languages spoken today: * Baltic languages ** Latvian (Baltic) ** Lithuanian (Baltic) * Slavic languages ** Polish (Slavic) ** Slovak (Slavic) ** Serbian (Slavic) ** Russian (Slavic) ** Croatian (Slavic) ** Ukrainian (Slavic) ** Belarusian (Slavic) For a complete list of Balto-Slavic languages, feel free to visit here. ==Related pages== * Baltic states * Eastern Europe * Uralic languages * Finno-Ugric languages * Indo-European peoples * Indo-European languages == References == Category:Baltic states Category:Eastern Europe Category:History of Europe Category:Indo-European languages",
