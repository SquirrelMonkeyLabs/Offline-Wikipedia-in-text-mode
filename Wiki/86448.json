 "text": "The Australian Open is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is the first one of the year. It is played in Melbourne, Australia. The Australian Open has been played on three different surfaces: *Grass (1905–1987) *Rebound Ace (a type of hard court, 1988–2007) *Plexicushion (a faster type of hard court, (2008–present) Before 1983, many of the best tennis players did not play at the tournament. This was because the Australian Open was far away from Europe and North America and was not considered as important as the other Grand Slam tournaments. ==Heat policy== The tournament is played in January, during the Australian summer. In 1998 an extreme heat rule was brought in. It is the only major tournament that has a heat policy. If the temperature gets higher than 35 degrees (C) matches may have to be stopped for a short time, because players feel dehydrated. Matches on the outside courts are stopped. The roof over the main stadium courts can be closed, and cooling systems turned on. In 2007 the temperature on the courts reached 50 degrees Celsius. ==Winners== *2023 Novak Djokovic and Aryna Sabalenka *2022 Rafael Nadal and Ashleigh Barty *2021 Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka * 2020 Novak Djokovic and Sofia Kenin * 2019 Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka * 2018 Roger Federer and Caroline Wozniacki * 2017 Roger Federer and Serena Williams * 2016 Novak Djokovic and Angelique Kerber * 2015 Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams * 2014 Stan Wawrinka and Li Na * 2013 Novak Djokovic and Victoria Azarenka * 2012 Novak Djokovic and Victoria Azarenka * 2011 Novak Djokovic and Kim Clijsters * 2010 Roger Federer and Serena Williams * 2009 Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams * 2008 Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova * 2007 Roger Federer and Serena Williams * 2006 Roger Federer and Amélie Mauresmo * 2005 Marat Safin and Serena Williams * 2004 Roger Federer and Justine Henin-Hardenne ==References== ==Other websites== * Australian Open website Category:Tennis tournaments in Australia Category:Grand Slam tennis tournaments Category:1905 establishments Category:1900s establishments in Australia",
