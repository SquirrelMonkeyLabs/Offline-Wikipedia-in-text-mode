 "text": "Personal is a telecommunications company that operates throughout Argentina through Telecom. It is currently the second largest mobile phone service provider in Argentina, after Movistar. ==Overview== Personal was launched in 1995 as the mobile phone brand for parent company Telecom, and provided mobile services in the northern part of the country (where its parent company also provided fixed telephony services). In the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, instead, Telecom provided mobile phone services since 1993 under the brand Miniphone, in a joint venture together with Telefónica. However, in 1999, legal provisions determine the division of Miniphone, as well as of all those companies whose shareholders were Telecom and Telefónica. It is from there that Telecom Personal also begins to provide service in Greater Buenos Aires independently (keeping part of the clients of the divided Miniphone). ==References== Category:Telecommunications companies of Argentina Category:Companies based in Buenos Aires Category:1995 establishments Category:1990s establishments in Argentina",
