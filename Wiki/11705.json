 "text": "Italy is a country in the south of Europe. It is divided into 20 regions. A region is a part of the country with a government and a President. In Italy, regions can decide on some things. They can give money to local business. They can also decide things about hospitals, schools, and transport. In some regions, citizens speak other languages. In Alto Adige/Südtirol many citizens speak primarily German. So this region is \"special\" and can make more decisions. Sardinia and Sicily are islands of Italy. They have different problems than other regions. They have also some different laws. These regions are called \"regions with special laws\" (). == List of the regions == Every region has a capital. Here is the list of the regions, the capital and other information.
