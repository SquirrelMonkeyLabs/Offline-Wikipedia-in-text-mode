 "text": "An act is a way to divide an opera, play, or other drama. Each act is a group of scenes that form an important part of the story. A story will be from one to five acts. Many modern stories are three acts, which match with the beginning, middle, and end of the story. One act is from about 30 to 60 minutes long.George, Kathleen (1994). Playwriting: The First Workshop.
