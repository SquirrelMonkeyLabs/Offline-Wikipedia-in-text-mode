It is made into sweets, and rolled into thin sheets for putting round cakes. The sweets are marzipan-filled chocolate and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables. Used as a covering for cakes, it is glazed. Glazing is a cooking technique which make it harder, and avoid unsightly damage. Category:Desserts",
