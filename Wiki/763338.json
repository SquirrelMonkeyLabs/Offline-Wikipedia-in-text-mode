Very often, it is shown as a single human eye, surrounded by triangle and rays of light or glory. It is often seen as a symbol for knowledge, trinity or for a god that \"sees all\". The most common depiction of the Eye of Providence is in the back of the Great Seal of the United States, which is depicted on the United States one-dollar bill. In a Christian context, it is often inside a triangle, where the triangle represents the Trinity. Freemasons also use the symbol, there it stands for knowledge.
