 "text": "In mathematics, the opposite or inverse of a number k is an additive or a subtractive number n which, when added to k, results in 0. The opposite of a is -a. For example, âˆ’7 is the opposite of 7, because 7+-7 = 0. == Definition == A number x is called an opposite or inverse number of another number y if x+y=0 . By definition, -x is the opposite number of x . For example, -2 is the opposite number of 2 and vice-versa. This is because -2+2=0. == Properties == The opposite numbers satisfy the properties listed below. # The opposite of 0 is 0. # Two opposite numbers have the same absolute value. This follows from the fact that the -a is the opposite number of a and both have the same absolute value |-a|=|a|. # The opposite of a positive number is the negative version of the number. The opposite of a negative number is the positive version of the number. # opposite numbers are located in the opposite direction on a number line having the same distance from the origin. That is, they are symmetric about the origin on a number line. # The sum of two opposite numbers is always zero, because -a+a=0. # The division of two non- zero opposite numbers is always -1 , because \\frac{-a}{a}=\\frac{a}{-a}=-1. # Each number has a unique opposite number. == Related pages == * Addition *Reciprocal *Absolute value *Operation (mathematics) == References == Category:Numbers Category:Arithmetics Category:Algebra",
