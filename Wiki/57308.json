It is a popular tourist destination, as its high peaks make skiing possible in Europe's most southern ski resort after Ski Centre on the island of Crete in an area along the Mediterranean Sea predominantly known for its warm temperatures and abundant sunshine. At its foothills is found the city of Granada and, a little farther, Málaga and Almería. == Other websites == * Google Maps Satellite Photo * Maps of the Sierra Nevada * XVII sport week -Old Pictures - * Sierra Nevada Official Website (In Spanish) * Sierra Nevada Piste Map == References == * == Bibliography == * Francisco Pérez Raya, Joaquín Molero Mesa, Francisco Valle Tendero, 1992: \"Parque Natural de Sierra Nevada.
