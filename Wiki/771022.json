 "text": "Machynlleth, sometimes known locally as just Mach, is a historic market town, community and electoral ward in the county of Powys in Wales. It is inside the historic boundaries of Montgomeryshire. Machynlleth was the seat of Owain Glyndŵr's Welsh Parliament in 1404, and because of this, says it is the \"ancient capital of Wales\". However, it has never held any official recognition as a capital. It applied for city status in 2000 and 2002, but was unsuccessful. Welsh is spoken by many as well as English. The 2011 Census found that 67% of the town's people had some knowledge of the Welsh language, with 39% able to read, write and speak the language. ==Twin town== Machynlleth is twinned with: * Belleville, Michigan, U.S. ==Gallery== File:Owain_Glyndwr's_parliament_-_geograph.org.uk_-_379309.jpg|The building said to be Owain Glyndŵr's 1404 Parliament House File:Dyfi_Bridge,_Machynlleth,_June_2016.jpg|Dyfi Bridge File:Clock_tower,_Machynlleth_NLW3363564.jpg|Machynlleth Clock Tower, circa 1885 Category:Towns in Powys Category:Market towns in Wales",
