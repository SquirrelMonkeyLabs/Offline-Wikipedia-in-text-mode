The incumbent Liberalâ€“National Coalition government, led by Premier Colin Barnett and Brendan Grylls, was re-elected in a landslide. They were opposed by the Labor Party, led by Mark McGowan. For the first time since 1996, the Liberals won a majority of seats in their own right, technically not requiring support from the Nationals. ==References== Category:2013 elections Category:Elections in Western Australia Category:2013 in Australia Category:March 2013 events",
