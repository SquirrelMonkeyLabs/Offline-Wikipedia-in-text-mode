 "text": "San Miguel is one of Manila's sixteen traditional districts, where Malacañang Palace, the seat of Government of the Philippines and official residence of the President of the Philippines is situated. Its neighborhood is a mix of government offices, ancestral houses of the affluent, middle class homes, churches and schools. == Geography == San Miguel consists of two riverine islands near the Spanish colonial settlement of Intramuros, separated from the main geography of Manila by an estuary, Estero de San Miguel, and by the Pasig River. To reach the government center, one has to cross any of several bridges traversing Estero de San Miguel, from west to east: Carlos Palanca Bridge, P. Casal Bridge, Nepomuceno Bridge, Arlegui Bridge, San Rafael Bridge, Chino Roces Bridge, and Concepcion Aguila Bridge. Extending towards P. Casal Bridge, Ayala Bridge crosses the Pasig River itself and connects to San Miguel's other riverine island, Isla de Convalecencia. == Gallery == File:09939jfCity Manila Ayala Isla Pasig River Boulevard Bridgefvf 08.jpg|Ayala Bridge File:Malacang Palace (San Miguel Manila; 07-05-2023) E911a 37.jpg|Malacanang Palace, Gate 2 File:Malacanang Palace (Kalayaan Hall) - left-side distant view (San Miguel, Manila)(2018-04-06).jpg|Malacanang Palace (Kalayaan Hall) File:0394jfManila Malacañang San Miguel Garden Fences Barangays Laurel Streetfvf 11.jpg|Malacañang Palace marker File:Iglesia de San Miguel, Manila, Filipinas, 2023-08-27, DD 29-31 HDR.jpg|San Miguel Church, Manila, Philippines File:Sampaloc San Miguel (Manila Central; 07-06-2023) E911a 24.jpg|Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino, Commission on the Filipino Language (office) File:MendiolaStreetjf2545 16.JPG|Chino Roces Bridge, MendiolaStreet File:San Beda College 09.jpg|The old entrance of San Beda College File:CollegeoftheHolySpiritManilajf2437 01.JPG|College of the Holy Spirit, Manila File:Saint_Jude_Archdiocesan_Shrine,_Manila.JPG|Saint Jude Archdiocesan Shrine File:La Consolacion College Manila 08.JPG|La Consolacion College File:Centro Escolar University, Manila.jpg|Centro Escolar University, Manila == Schools == The San Miguel district is home to Roman Catholic colleges and universities such as San Beda University run by the Benedictine order, College of the Holy Spirit run by the Missionary Sisters Servant of the Holy Spirit, Saint Jude Catholic School run by the Philippine Central Province of the Society of the Divine Word, and La Consolacion College Manila run by the Augustinian Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation.
