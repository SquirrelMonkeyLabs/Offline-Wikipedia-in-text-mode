 "text": "Landscape urbanism is a new theory in the field of urban and regional planning that first appeared in the late 20th century claiming that the best way to organize cities is through the landscape design of the city rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase urban landscape first appeared in the mid-1990s. Since then this phrase has received many different uses but is most often cited as a post-modernist response to the failures of \"New Urbanism\". In 2008 the first Biennale in the world of \"Landscape Urbanism\" was held in the city of Bat-Yam in Israel which dealt with New Urbanism. == Related pages == * Urban design * Landscape architecture == Other websites == *Sustainable Urban Development Resource Guide *History and theory of landscape urbanism *Bat Yam International Biennale of Landscape Urbanism Category:Architecture Category:Urban and regional sciences",
