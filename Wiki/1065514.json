 "text": "Namor McKenzie, also known as the Sub-Mariner is a major character and recurring antagonist of the Marvel Comics universe. Created by writer-artist Bill Everett for comic book packager Funnies Inc., the character first appeared in Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 (uncirculated). Namor first appeared publicly in Marvel Comics #1 (cover-dated October 1939). It was the first comic book from Timely Comics, the 1930s–1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. == Fictional character biography == The hybrid mutant son of an Atlantean and a human, Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner, is alternately loved and hated by Earth's surface population—often depending on his actions. As Atlantean royalty who defends his homeland fiercely, Namor has a massive chip on his shoulder. == Powers and abilities == Considered to be the first mutant and the ruler of Atlantis, he developed a rather pernicious nature. Namor possesses the super strength and aquatic abilities of the Homo mermanus race, as well as the mutant ability of flight, along with other superhuman powers. This resulted him coming into conflict with Black Panther along with various other heroes, such as the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four. == In other media == The character made its live-action cinematic debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), in which he was played by Mexican actor Tenoch Huerta Mejía.
