He was nicknamed De Rode Geit (translated: De rossige kuif), due to his red hair and heading technique. He played with Go Ahead Eagles from 1957 to 1969. During the 1960s PSV, Feyenoord and the predecessors of FC Twente were interested to contract Niehaus. However, Go Ahead did not want to let him go. They raised the transfer fee to 125,000 guilders and increased his salary. His last contract ended at the end of 1969. He was the son of Willemina Johanna Kroezen and mason Gerrit Niehaus. Neihaus was married to Jannie Nienhuis.
