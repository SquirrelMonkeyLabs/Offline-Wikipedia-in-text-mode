 "text": "A grave, or burial spot is where somebody or something is buried after they have died. Graves are usually placed in a graveyard, with a headstone used to identify the dead person. A funeral will occur if the family has enough money. If they do not, there will not be a proper funeral. The name on the grave is of the dead person. For example, William Shakespeare was buried in England. == Related pages == *Tomb == Other websites == Category:Death customs Category:Burial monuments and structures",
