 "text": "Calanley mosque or Masjid express is a historically Ibadist mosque in Kismayo, Jubaland. Its minarets have a Ibadite semiellipse shape. The reason the minarets have a Ibadist design is that Kismayo and Jubaland used to be under the influence of the Ibadi-ruled Sultanate of Zanzibar. This is the reason that colonial era buildings in Jubaland have an Ibadist design.Hardinge, Arthur H. \"Legislative Methods in the Zanzibar and East Africa Protectorates.\" J. Soc. Comp.
