The markets are also open 24 hours a day for 5 days a week and are some of the most active as traders from across the globe exchange currencies. == Retail Forex Market == While most forex is traded by large institutions, banks and corporations, there are a great many retail foreign exchange traders. These are traders that will trade on their own accounts and buy / sell forex in order to target a specific return.
