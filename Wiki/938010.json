 "text": "The New Ecologic and Social People's Union (, NUPES) was a left-wing alliance of political party in France led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. It was formed on May Day 2022. Parties supporting this are La France insoumise (LFI), the Socialist Party (PS), the French Communist Party (PCF), Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV), Ensemble! (E!), and Génération.s (G.s). This party was founded for the 2022 French legislative election and its goal was to reject Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble Citoyens on the centre-right a majority in the National Assembly. Some left-wing parties agreed to create a coalition to make Mélenchon the Prime Minister of France. NUPES won the most seats outside of Ensemble, causing Macron not to have a majority, however they won about 22% of the seats on the National Assembly. They did win 31% of the popular vote, however the far-right National Rally will most likely be the opposition party because NUPES is an alliance of parties. Mélenchon said that NUPES and the French Left should form a united, single group in Parliament. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Political parties in France",
