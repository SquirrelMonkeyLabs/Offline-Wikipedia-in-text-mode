 "text": "Scarborough, Ontario is a formal place located in Canada. Since European settlers arrived in Scarborough in the 1790s, the area has developed into a fully urbanized, culturally diversified community from a collection of tiny rural settlements and farms. Originally incorporated as a township in 1850, the territory was reorganized as a borough in 1967 and joined Metropolitan Toronto in 1953. Over the following ten years, the borough quickly expanded as a Toronto suburb, and in 1983 it was incorporated as a city. The city and the remainder of Metropolitan Toronto were combined to form the current city of Toronto in 1998. The Toronto municipal government currently uses the Scarborough Civic Centre, which was the city's final seat of government. Category:Settlements in Ontario",
