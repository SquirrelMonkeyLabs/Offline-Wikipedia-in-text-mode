 "text": "The Syrian Army, officially the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) (), is the land force branch of the Syrian Armed Forces. ==Establishment== It started from local military forces created by France after World War I. These forces became one force in 1945, the year before Syria became independent. ==Politics== Since 1946, it has played a major role in Syria's politics. They did six military coups: two in 1949, including the March 1949 Syrian coup d'état and the August 1949 coup by Colonel Sami al-Hinnawi, and one each in 1954, 1963, 1966, and 1970. ==Wars== It has fought four wars with Israel (1948, the Six-Day War in 1967, the October War of 1973, and 1982 in Lebanon) and one with Jordan (Black September in Jordan, 1970). An armored division was also sent to Saudi Arabia in 1990–91 during the Persian Gulf War, but it did not do much. From 1976 to 2005 it was the major pillar of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. Within Syria, it played a major part in stopping the 1979–82 Islamist uprising in Syria. Since early 2011 has been fighting the Syrian Civil War. == References == Category:Armies Category:Organizations based in Syria",
