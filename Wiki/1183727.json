Primarily settled in urban centers such as Bengaluru, their migration has been driven by factors including education, employment, and professional opportunities. The community retains aspects of its linguistic and cultural identity, notably the use of the Meiteilon (Manipuri) language and the observance of traditional Meitei festivals and customs. While geographically distant from their native region, the Meitei population in Karnataka maintains social and cultural networks that support community cohesion and cultural continuity. They are sometimes referred to as Kannadiga Meitei people. == Cinema == ONENESS, a Meitei language film directed by Priyakanta Laishram, was selected for the 14th Bangalore Queer Film Festival (BQFF 2024), held from August 23 to 25, 2024.
