The studio's most successful movie to date is The Smurfs. However, its most critically acclaimed movie is Arthur Christmas, which was co-produced with Aardman Animations. == History == === Sony Pictures deal (2001–03) === In 2001, Sony Pictures considered selling off its visual effects facility Sony Pictures Imageworks but after failing to find a suitable buyer, having been impressed with the CGI sequences of Stuart Little 2 and seeing the box office successes of DreamWorks Animation's Shrek and Disney/Pixar's Monsters, Inc., SPI was reconfigured to become an animation studio. Astro Boy, which had been in development at Sony since 1997 as a live- action film, was set to be SPI's first all-CGI film, but never made it to fruition.[3] On May 9, 2002, Sony Pictures Animation was established to develop characters, stories and movies with SPI taking over the digital production while maintaining its visual effects production.[4] Meanwhile, SPI produced two short films, the Academy Award-winning The ChubbChubbs! and Early Bloomer, as a result of testing its strengths and weaknesses in producing all- CGI animation.[5] === Sony Pictures Animation (2003–2011) === On its first anniversary on May 9, 2003, Sony Pictures Animation announced a full slate of animated projects in development: Open Season, an adaptation of a Celtic folk ballad Tam Lin, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Surf's Up, and a feature- length film version of The ChubbChubbs!.[6] On May 2014, it was announced that Netflix had acquired streaming rights to films produced by Sony Pictures Animation.[7] === Sony Pictures Animation (2011–18) === In June 2019, Sony Pictures Animation announced that they had launched an \"International\" division headed by Aron Warner at the 2019 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, with Wish Dragon set to be the division's first film. The same day, they also announced an \"Alternative\" division aimed at producing adult animated content, headed by Katie Baron and Kevin Noel. In addition to Tartakovsky's films Black Knight and Fixed, the division's TV shows are set to include The Boondocks, a reboot of the original TV series that originally aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block from 2005 to 2014; Superbago, a co-production with Stupid Buddy Studios that was originally green lit as a feature film; and Hungry Ghosts, a series based on the Dark Horse graphic novel by Anthony Bourdain and Joel Rose.[10] They had previously announced their plans to produce adult content at the 2017 Annecy festival.[11] === Sony Pictures Animation (2018–present) === According to Kristine Belson, president of SPA, the studio produces films on a 1:1 development-to-production ratio, meaning that the studio puts films into development as much as it places films in production, unlike other animation studios.[11] == Release Feature Movies == Title Release Date Distribution/Co- production with Animation services Released by Notes 1 Open Season September 29, 2006 Columbia Pictures Sony Pictures Imageworks Theatrical First SPA in 3D.
