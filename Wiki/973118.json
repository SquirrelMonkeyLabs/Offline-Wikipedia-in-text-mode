 "text": "The Costa Rica brook frog or red-eyed stream frog (Duellmanohyla uranochroa) is a frog. It lives in Costa Rica and Panama. Scientists have seen it between 70 and 1740 meters above sea level. The skin of the frog's back is green in color. The belly and neck are bright yellow. The parts of the legs that face the ground are yellow but less bright. There is a yellow-white stripe from the mouth to the place where the legs meet the body, one on each side. The iris of the eye is bright red. The female frog is bigger than the male frog, and she has bigger eardrums. This frog moves at night. They go to mountain streams to look for food. During the day, they sit in bromeliad plants. The frogs lay eggs in May and June. The frog's voice sounds like \"boop boop boop boop,\" but different frogs and frogs in different places can sound different. The female frog lays eggs in pools of water with silt on the bottom instead of sand or mud. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Sometimes even small changes can hurt this frog. Climate change and ultraviolet light can also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
