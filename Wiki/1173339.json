 "text": "A finger bowl is a small container containing scented water or a few lemon slices in which guests dip their fingers to clean them. It is frequently replaced in the XXI XXI. century with individually wrapped, scented disposable wipes. At the table, finger bowls have their place next to the cutlery. == History == Throughout the ancient Near East, at banquets, it was customary to eat with three fingers: the thumb, index finger and middle finger. The ritual of hand washing is codified, and slaves bring scented water before meals and finger bowls to perform these ablutions. In Rome, in addition to meals eaten with a spoon (soup), food was picked up with the fingers and brought to the mouth. Servants were there to offer small bowls filled with scented water and a napkin to wipe one's fingers. In France, finger bowls appeared late and did not yet exist under Napoleon III, although they were already known to the British. His presence at the table is still prescribed in the 20th and 21st centuries by the etiquette guides, since the nature of the foods offered makes their use necessary : asparagus, seafood for example. == Related pages == * Food == References == Category:Collecting",
