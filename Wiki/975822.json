 "text": "The Bromeliad tree frog (Bromeliohyla bromeliacia) is a frog. It lives in Belize and Guatemala. Scientists have seen it between 350 and 1790 m above sea level. The adult male frog is 24.1 - 29.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 32.0 - 36.0 mm long. The skin of the frog's back can change color. During the day, it is brown or yellow-brown, and it gets lighter at night. It does not have marks or stripes. The iris of the eye is bronze in color with some black marks. The belly is whitish in color. The female frog lays eggs underwater in bromeliad plants. This frog is not in danger of dying out. But human beings change the places where it lives. Droughts cause problems for this frog because the frog does well when things are wet. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
