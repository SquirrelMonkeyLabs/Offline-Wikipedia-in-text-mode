 "text": "The flag of Iceland has a white-fimbriated red Nordic cross on a blue field. The flag was designed by Matthías Þórðarson ( Matthias Thordarson) in 1906. The white was supposed to represent snow and ice, while the red represented the fire and lava of Icelandic volcanoes. The blue could have represented either the blue of the mountains, the Atlantic Ocean, or both. The flag colors have no official meaning now, however. The flag gained full recognition from Denmark on December 1st 1918, and became the sole official flag in 1944, after Iceland gained independence. == References == Iceland Category:National symbols of Iceland Category:Flags introduced in 1918",
