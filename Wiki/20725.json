It is common for people to use anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism is often used in stories and art. The story of the \"Three Little Pigs\" has a wolf and three pigs who talk and act like humans. Disney's Mickey Mouse also talks and acts like a human. Some people act and dress like anthropomorphic animals, and call themselves \"furries\". The novel The Call of the Wild also uses anthropomorphism. The main character is a dog named Buck. Many other characters are dogs and wolves.

Humans are not as good at explaining why non-human things do things. This can lead to people assuming non-human things will do things like humans. Humans learn about other humans early in life. They know more about humans than about things that are not humans, and they can remember it better. ==Related pages== * Furry: A section of anthropomorphism where animals and legendary creatures are shown as human-like in stories and art, It's a modern name given for Anthropomorphic Animals. ==References== Category:Metaphors Category:Illusions",
