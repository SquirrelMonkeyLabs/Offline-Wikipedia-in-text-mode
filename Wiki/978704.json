 "text": "The Guinle tree frog (Aplastodiscus leucopygius) is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 800 and 1600 meters above sea level. The adult frog is about 35-45 mm long from nose to rear end. It is green in color with white marks near its rear end. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. The male frogs climb high into the trees before they sing for the female frogs. People have seen them sitting on high branches. Many of the places where this frog lives are in national parks, for example, Parque Estadual Nova Baden. So it is not in danger of dying out. But there are still fewer of these frogs than there were. This is because human beings change the places where they live. Human beings cut down trees and change wetlands to drier lands for wood for building or to build farms or make places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
