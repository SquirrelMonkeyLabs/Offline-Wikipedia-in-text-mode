 "text": "A complex sentence is a sentence with two or more of dependent sentences and independent sentences mixed together by subordinating conjunctions, such as \"although,\" \"after,\" \"until,\" \"while,\" or \"when'\". For example: \"Before the curtain rose, Nick came out and took a bow.\" In this sentence, \"before\" is a subordinating conjunction. \"Before the curtain rose\" is a dependent sentence. With its subordinating conjunction, it joins the independent sentence by being smoothly contacted by its meaning. But without this independent sentence,\"Nick came and took a bow\", the dependent sentence cannot stay by itself. \"Before the curtain rose\" cannot stay by itself without an independent sentence joined together by adding a subordinating conjunction. Charlie Waldron invented the complex sentence. Dylan Mahoney made the 2nd most famous complex sentence. Category:Sentences",
