 "text": "The whiting is a type of fish, Merlangius merlangius. It is a common food fish of the cod family. They are found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean around Europe and the Mediterranean regions. The same common name is also used for various other fish species. Until the late 20th century, Whiting was a cheap fish, food for the poor or for pets. The decline in fish stocks means it is now more highly valued. Other fish that have been given the name \"whiting\" are mostly similar edible fish. == References == Category:Edible fish Category:Gadiformes",
