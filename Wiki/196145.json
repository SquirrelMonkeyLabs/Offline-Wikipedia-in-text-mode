 "text": "Night vision is being able to see in the dark. Some animals, like cats, have natural night vision - they can see in very low light without any help. Humans do not have good night vision. If there is not enough light to see well, a human may need a night vision device such as night vision goggles to help them see. Night vision goggles come in two types: *Amplification - This increases the visible light, and makes it bright enough for our eyes to see. It works well outside but cannot be used in a completely dark place, such as a cave. * Infrared - Uses a different part of the light that we cannot see. It sees heat energy. Animals and vehicles produce heat and are easily seen in infrared, even when it is completely black. Category:Vision",
