They were previously also found in Jordan and Israel. They live in different habitats including lakes, rivers, estuaries, freshwater marshes, and mangrove swamps. The Nile crocodile is carnivorous. It eats bigger animals as it grows. Young crocodiles eats insects and small fish, while adult crocodiles may catch and eat birds, zebras, antelopes, wildebeests and buffalo. The Nile crocodile will attack anything, even other crocodiles. The crocodiles mate in the water, and then the female lays her eggs in a hole dug in the ground. They can lay 60 eggs which take about 90 days to hatch. The female guards the eggs, or is nearby, until they hatch. Young crocodiles are able to reproduce when they get to about 12 years old. The muscles responsible for opening the mouth are exceptionally weak in comparison to the strength of the muscles for closing. ==References== Category:Crocodilians of Africa",
