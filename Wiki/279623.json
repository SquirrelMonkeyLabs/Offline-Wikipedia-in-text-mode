 "text": "The reticulated python (Python reticulatus) is a species of Python found in Southeast Asia. Adults can grow to 22.8 feet (6.95 m) in length but average is 9.8-19.7 feet. They are the world's longest snakes and longest reptile, but not the most heavily built. They usually weigh about 350 lbs. The thickest and heaviest living snake is the anaconda, also known as the green anaconda. Like all pythons, they are non-venomous constrictors (they squeeze their prey) and normally not considered dangerous to humans. Although large ones are powerful enough to kill an adult human, attacks seldom happen. ==References== Category:Pythons Category:Snakes of Asia",
