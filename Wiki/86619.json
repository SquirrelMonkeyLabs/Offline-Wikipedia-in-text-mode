He also performs as DJ Starscream. His injuries include breaking both of his heels. He likes the television series Transformers and takes his DJ name \"Starscream\" from one of its characters. He also has tattoos of the characters. In Slipknot he wears a metallic style mask with lighting up eyes and moving eyebrows and mouth.
