The organization helps families of soldiers who die in peacetime, and works against corruption. Many of the deaths are called suicides, so the families have trouble getting money after the death. In 2007, lawyers from Mother’s Right helped 132 families go to court for survivor's benefits. They also helped 5,323 families of men who died. The organization now helps 5000 people a year. They helped a total of 80,000 people. == Other websites == Mother's Right Foundation (English) == References == Category:Women who received the International Women of Courage Award Category:Living people Category:Russian activists Category:1959 births Category:People from Moscow Category:Russian journalists Category:Women's rights activists",
