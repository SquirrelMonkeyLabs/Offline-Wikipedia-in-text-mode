 "text": "The National Self-Government of Germans in Hungary (German: Landesselbstverwaltung der Ungarndeutschen, LdU; Hungarian: Magyarországi Németek Országos Önkormányzata, MNOÖ) is the organization representing the interests of the German minority in Hungary. The German minority is Hungary’s second-largest ethnic group, making up over 2.5% of the population. The LdU aims to protect and promote the German language, culture, traditions, and identity in Hungary. It supports keeping the German language alive through cultural activities, encourages German language teaching in Hungarian schools, and builds international connections, especially with Germany, through exchanges and partnerships. The LdU seeks cultural autonomy by managing German institutions in Hungary, which is its main focus. It also promotes cooperation between Hungary and neighboring countries, especially German-speaking ones. == References == Category:Political parties in Hungary Category:German people Category:Ethnic groups in Hungary",
