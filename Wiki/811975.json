 "text": "\"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\" is the 10th episode of the 26th season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on the Fox network on January 4, 2015. The episode is about the Simpson family being taken to a planet of alien life. == Story == The Simpson family goes to an amusement park. They go inside of a ride that turns into a spaceship. They do not know that they are being taken to outer space. Two aliens named Kang and Kodos tell the family that they are going to their alien planet. Once they get there, Kang and Kodos put the Simpson family in a cage as prisoners. They get put inside of a zoo. They are told that one person in the family will be eaten for a ritual. They choose Homer Simpson to be the one eaten. Homer is seen with bacon on him in the ritual. Some aliens (that act like hippies) get Homer and say that aliens should not eat other species. Homer is safe, but he learns that everyone else in the family will be eaten instead. Homer goes back and is part of the ritual again. The queen of the planet starts to eat Homer. However, she gets poisoned because the family eats many junk food. The queen dies from the poison. They are put on a spaceship to go back to Earth. However, the family goes away from the Earth so that they do not have to talk to Grampa Simpson. == Production == \"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\" was written by Al Jean and David Mirkin. David Silverman is the director of the episode. The episode was first going to be the last episode of the 24th season. The episode \"Dangers on a Train\" was shown as the last episode of the season instead. Al Jean said that this was because the episode's story was thought of being made into a movie. This would be a sequel to The Simpsons Movie. Back in 1992, the episode \"Kamp Krusty\" was also thought of being made as a movie. Jean said that people who watched the episode would see why it was not made as a movie. Jean was also worried that fans of the show would think that the story is not canon (events that are part of the show's story). He thought that this would be controversial with fans. == Reception == 10.62 million people watched the episode when it was first shown on television. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club did not like the episode's strange ideas. He said that the episode is a \"product\" of \"breezy disregard\" of what makes there show good. Tony Sokol from Den of Geek thought that the episode is a \"singular highlight\" of the 26th season. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:The Simpsons (season 26) episodes Category:2015 television episodes",
