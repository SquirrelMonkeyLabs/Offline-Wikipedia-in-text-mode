 "text": "The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is a physics competition for secondary school students and is one of the International Olympiads. The main aim of IPhO is to test the highest level of knowledge, critical thinking, problem solving, right practices of presentation and analysis, and hands-on skills in theoretical and experimental physics. The first IPhO was organized by Prof. Czesław Ścisłowski in Warsaw (Poland) in 1967. Since then, the Olympiad has been organized annually in different countries as a 9-10-days competition wherein national teams comprising a maximum of five of their best physics students and two team leaders participate. == Overview == Number Year Host Country Host City 1 1967 Poland Warsaw 2 1968 Hungary Budapest 3 1969 Czechoslovakia Brno 4 1970 Soviet Union Moscow 5 1971 Bulgaria Sofia 6 1972 Romania Bucharest 1973 Not held as no country was willing to organise it. 7 1974 Poland Warsaw 8 1975 East Germany Güstrow 9 1976 Hungary Budapest 10 1977 Czechoslovakia Hradec Králové 1978 Not held as no non-socialist country was ready to organise the competition without a prior, necessary long-time preparation effort. 11 1979 Soviet Union Moscow 1980 Not held as no non- socialist country was ready to organise the competition without a prior, necessary long-time preparation effort. 12 1981 Bulgaria Varna 13 1982 West Germany Malente 14 1983 Romania Bucharest 15 1984 Sweden Sigtuna 16 1985 Yugoslavia Portorož 17 1986 United Kingdom London-Harrow 18 1987 East Germany Jena 19 1988 Austria Bad Ischl 20 1989 Poland Warsaw 21 1990 Netherlands Groningen 22 1991 Cuba Havana 23 1992 Finland Helsinki 24 1993 United States Williamsburg 25 1994 China Beijing 26 1995 Australia Canberra 27 1996 Norway Oslo 28 1997 Canada Sudbury 29 1998 Iceland Reykjavík 30 1999 Italy Padova 31 2000 United Kingdom Leicester 32 2001 Turkey Antalya 33 2002 Indonesia Bali 34 2003 Taiwan Taipei 35 2004 South Korea Pohang 36 2005 Spain Salamanca 37 2006 Singapore Singapore 38 2007 Iran Isfahan 39 2008 Vietnam Hanoi 40 2009 Mexico Mérida 41 2010 Croatia Zagreb 42 2011 Thailand Bangkok 43 2012 Estonia Tartu and Tallinn 44 2013 Denmark Copenhagen 45 2014 Kazakhstan Astana 46 2015 India Mumbai 47 2016 Switzerland and Liechtenstein Zurich 48 2017 Indonesia Yogyakarta 49 2018 Portugal Lisbon 50 2019 Israel Tel Aviv 2020 Not held due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
