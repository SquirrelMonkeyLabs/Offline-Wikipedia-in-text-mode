He was considered one of Castile's greatest kings because of his braveness. He succeeded his father, King Alfonso X in 1284. After Sancho became king, he put down a rebellion led by his nephew, Alfonso, the son of Sancho's older brother, Ferdinand. Like his predecessors, Sancho actively fought in the Reconquista and conquered some lands from the Moors. On 21 April 1295, Sancho succumbed to Tuberculosis where he died four days later on 25 April 1295 at the age of 37. He was succeeded by his 10-year old son, Ferdinand IV with his wife, Queen María de Molina serving as regent for the boy king.
