 "text": "The Canadian National Men's Ice Hockey Team (also known as Team Canada) is the ice hockey team for Canada. The team is run by Hockey Canada, a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. From 1920 until 1963 Canada did not have one national hockey team. Instead, several senior amateur club teams played for Canada . Canada's national men's team was created in 1963 by Father David Bauer as a part of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. This team played out of the University of British Columbia. During the 1972 Summit Series, the name \"Team Canada\" was first used. Team Canada has been one of the leading national ice hockey teams playing around the world. They won the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, four of five Canada Cups since 1976, nine Olympic gold medals (the most of any hockey nation); Salt Lake City 2002, Vancouver 2010, and Sochi 2014. They are 25-time IIHF World Champions and winner of the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. ==History== From 1920 to 1963 the senior amateur club teams that played for Canada were usually the most recent Allan Cup champions. The last amateur club team from Canada to win a gold medal at the World Championship was the Trail Smoke Eaters in 1961. After the 1963 World Championships, Father David Bauer founded the national team to play hockey for Canada in games around the world. This new team had it's first games at the 1964 Winter Olympics. Before the Soviet Union began playing international hockey in 1954, Canada won most of the international hockey games. Team Canada won six out of seven golds at the Olympics and 10 World Championship gold medals. After Canada won the Winter Olympic Gold medal in 1952, they did not win another gold medal for 50 years. From 1962 to 1993 the team was not able to win any World Championships. It was difficult for Team Canada to win because the country's best professional players were not able to play for Team Canada. Instead, they were playing for their National Hockey League teams. Canada stopped playing in IIHF events in 1970 and Team Canada stopped playing in any games after the team was told they could not use semi- professional players at the World Championship. Canada once again began playing in the IIHF in 1977 after the IIHF President Dr. Sabetzki and top officials of professional ice hockey in Canada and the United States were able to come to an agreement. They agreed that professionals would be allowed to play hockey at the World Championship and the tournament would be scheduled later in the year. This allowed players from the NHL to play, after their teams were no longer playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs. They also agreed to create the \"Canada Cup\". This championship would be played every four years in North America. Canada, the United States, and the four best European national teams would play in this championship. In 1983, Hockey Canada began the \"Program of Excellence\". This program was made to help prepare a team for the Winter Olympics every four years. This new National Team played a full season together all over the world against both national and club teams. Young players hoping to play in the NHL would play on this new team. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee voted to allow professional athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988. This allowed many experienced NHL players to join the team. In 1998 the NHL decided to stop letting players compete in the Olympics, so the Program of Excellence was shut down. After not winning a gold medal for 33 years, Canada won the 1994 World Championship in Italy. Since 1994, Team Canada won in 1997, 2003, 2004, and 2007. Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years at Salt Lake City 2002. At Vancouver 2010, Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 win against the United States in the final. Sidney Crosby's overtime goal won Canada the final gold medal awarded at the Games. At the 2012 World Championship in Finland and Sweden, Ryan Murray became the first draft eligible prospect to represent Canada at the Ice Hockey World Championship. After winning the Gold medal in the 2010 Winter Olympics, Team Canada was able to win gold again at the Sochi 2014 Olympic games. This was the first time a team had won Gold medals twice in a row since the Soviet Union in 1988. Team Canada was also the first to finish the tournament without losing any games since 1984. The team played so well that it was said they may be the best team that Canada had ever had. Drew Doughty and Shea Weber scored the most goals for the team, while Jonathan Toews scored the gold medal-winning goal in the first period of a 3–0 win over Sweden in the final. After the 2014 Olympics Steve Yzerman, stepped down as general manager of the team. In 2015, Team Canada was able to win their first hockey World Championship since 2007. ===List of teams representing Canada from 1920 to 1963=== Event Team Hometown 1920 Summer Olympics Winnipeg Falcons Winnipeg, Manitoba 1924 Winter Olympics Toronto Granites Toronto, Ontario 1928 Winter Olympics University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario 1930 World Championships Toronto CCMs Toronto 1931 World Championships University of Manitoba Winnipeg, Manitoba 1932 Winter Olympics Winnipeg Hockey Club Winnipeg, Manitoba 1933 World Championships Toronto National Sea Fleas Toronto, Ontario 1934 World Championships Saskatoon Quakers Saskatoon, Saskatchewan 1935 World Championships Winnipeg Monarchs Winnipeg, Manitoba 1936 Winter Olympics Port Arthur Bearcats Port Arthur, Ontario 1937 World Championships Kimberley Dynamiters Kimberley, British Columbia 1938 World Championships Sudbury Wolves Sudbury, Ontario 1939 World Championships Trail Smoke Eaters Trail, British Columbia World Championships not held from 1940–1946 during World War II. 1947 World Championships Did not participate 1948 Winter Olympics Ottawa RCAF Flyers RCAF Station Trenton, Ontario 1949 World Championships Sudbury Wolves Sudbury, Ontario 1950 World Championships Edmonton Mercurys Edmonton, Alberta 1951 World Championships Lethbridge Maple Leafs Lethbridge, Alberta 1952 Winter Olympics Edmonton Mercurys Edmonton, Alberta 1953 World Championships Did not participate 1954 World Championships East York Lyndhursts East York, Ontario 1955 World Championships Penticton Vees Penticton, British Columbia 1956 Winter Olympics Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen Kitchener–Waterloo, Ontario 1957 World Championships Did not participate 1958 World Championships Whitby Dunlops Whitby, Ontario 1959 World Championships Belleville McFarlands Belleville, Ontario 1960 Winter Olympics Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen Kitchener–Waterloo, Ontario 1961 World Championships Trail Smoke Eaters Trail, British Columbia 1962 World Championships Galt Terriers Galt, Ontario 1963 World Championships Trail Smoke Eaters Trail, British Columbia ==Players== ===2014 Winter Olympics roster=== Roster for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, from February 8–23, 2014. * Head coach: Mike Babcock * Assistant coach: Lindy Ruff * Assistant coach: Claude Julien * Assistant coach: Ken Hitchcock # Position Player DOB Team Birthplace 1 G Roberto Luongo Apr 4, 1979 Vancouver Canucks Montreal, Quebec 31 G Carey Price Aug 16, 1987 Montreal Canadiens Anahim Lake, British Columbia 41 G Mike Smith Mar 22, 1982 Phoenix Coyotes Kingston, Ontario 19 D Jay Bouwmeester Sep 27, 1983 St. Louis Blues Edmonton, Alberta 8 D Drew Doughty Dec 8, 1989 Los Angeles Kings London, Ontario 5 D Dan Hamhuis Dec 13, 1982 Vancouver Canucks Smithers, British Columbia 2 D Duncan Keith Jul 16, 1983 Chicago Blackhawks Winnipeg, Manitoba 27 D Alex Pietrangelo Jan 18, 1990 St. Louis Blues King City, Ontario 44 D Marc-Édouard Vlasic Mar 30, 1987 San Jose Sharks Montreal, Quebec 6 D Shea Weber (A) Aug 14, 1985 Nashville Predators Sicamous, British Columbia 76 D P.K.
