The song's sound is very different to her debut single \"Young\" and is more hip hop and R&B; oriented. ==Background== The song was announced as Tulisa's second single on 24 July 2012. Tulisa told Capital FM: \"This is now me going back to me and trying to define myself as an artist because I knew I wanted a number one hit as my first release. I got that with 'Young', so I went even more urban with this second single. I don't expect it to even possibly get top ten it's that urban, but you never know. The fanbase could pull through, the N-Dubletts could pull through, and it is a smash but it's an urban smash and I know that in the UK these days it is a lot tougher with urban music.\" ==Track listing== Digital download # \"Live It Up\" (radio edit) – 3:36 # \"Live It Up\" (album mix) – 3:50 # \"Live It Up\" (explicit Mix) – 4:36 # \"Live It Up\" (Big League dancehall mix) – 4:17 Promotional CD single # \"Live It Up\" (radio edit) (Featuring Tyga) – 3:36 # \"Live It Up\" (radio edit) ==Charts== Chart (2012) Peak position ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Ireland Digital download All Around the World United Kingdom ==References== Category:2012 songs Category:Tulisa songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Dancehall songs Category:R&B; songs",
