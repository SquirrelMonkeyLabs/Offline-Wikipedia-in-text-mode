 "text": "The United States Army is a branch (or section) of the United States Armed Forces. The army mainly deals with land based missions, while other parts of the military deal with air and sea missions. The current Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army is the 47th President Donald J Trump. The United States Secretary of the Army, a civilian, leads the army with the help of the Army Chief of Staff, a general. Members of an army are called soldiers. When people join the army, they must serve for a certain amount of time called a \"tour of duty\". A new soldier or recruit goes through Basic Training at a training camp to become a soldier. Each soldier is trained in weapons and equipment that they will operate to carry out missions. ==Mission== The United States Army serves as the land-based branch of the U.S. Military. ==Combat arms== Traditionally, the US Army has had three different kinds of combat arms regiments: ===Artillery=== File:5FARegtCOA.jpg|5th Field Artillery Regiment (5th FAR) File:244 ADA Regt CoA.png|244th Air Defense Artillery Regiment (244th ADAR) ===Cavalry (Armored)=== File:7th Cavalry Regiment (USA).png|7th Cavalry Regiment (7th CR) ===Infantry=== File:3rd Infantry Regiment COA.svg|3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) File:69th INF REG COA.gif|69th Infantry Regiment (New York) File:182nd Infantry (former 182nd Cavalry) Regiment Coat of arms.jpg|182nd Infantry Regiment (United States) File:369th InfantryCOA.jpeg|369th Infantry Regiment (United States) now 369th Sustainment Brigade (United States) NYANG File:178th Infantry Regiment Coat of arms.png|370th Infantry Regiment (United States) now 178th Infantry Regiment (Illinois National Guard} File:371 Inf Rgt DUI.jpg|371st Infantry Regiment (United States} File:DC372MPBn.jpg|372nd Infantry Regiment {United States} now HHD/372nd Military Police Battalion (ARNG DC) ==Related pages== * United States National Guard * United States Army Reserve * United States Army Center of Military History * United States Army trucks",
