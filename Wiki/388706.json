 "text": "A cartoon series is a set of animated television programs (cartoons). Cartoons in a series are usually given a name that shows they are part of one set. When multiple cartoons are part of a cartoon series, each cartoon is called an episode. Episodes of cartoon series are played on television networks regularly. Some cartoon series are released on websites on the Internet. Others are released in direct-to-video forms; these can have some episodes of the series, or all of the episodes. Like other episodes of television programs, episodes of a cartoon series can share the same characters, settings (the places the story takes place in), or themes. Some cartoon series use episodes to tell a longer story in parts. Other cartoon series use each episode to tell a different story. Episodes of a cartoon series can be longer or shorter, depending on the show. Cartoons that are aired on television are often made to match the time slots on the television network. For example, it is common for an episode of a cartoon series to be 11 minutes or 22 minutes long. Category:Animated television series",
