 "text": "Christianity in the United States has shaped much of the nation's cultural and historical identity. It began with European settlers, particularly Puritans in the 17th century. Protestantism became dominant, with denominations like Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians playing central roles in the country's development. Over time, diverse Christian traditions took root, including Catholicism and, more recently, Eastern Orthodoxy. The U.S. also witnessed major religious movements, like the Great Awakening, which led to evangelism and social reform, and later the rise of Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism. Today, Christianity remains the largest religion in the U.S., though it is experiencing declining adherence, with growth in secularism and non-Christian faiths. Despite this, Christianity continues to influence American culture, politics, and social values. Category:Christianity in the United States",
