 "text": "The Fenn Treasure is a treasure worth over a million dollars that was supposedly hidden by art dealer and author Forrest Fenn (August 22, 1930 - September 7, 2020) in the Rocky Mountains. Fenn said he was going to go back and get it when the value given by newspapers is inflated to 10 million dollars. When asked why he created the treasure hunt, Fenn said he \"just wanted to give people some hope.\" Many people have claimed to have found the treasure, but no one has provided any evidence to him supporting their claim. As of July 2017, Fenn has stated \"The treasure remains where I hid it about 7 years ago\". Many searchers have been within 200 feet (60 m) of the treasure and many within 500 feet (150 m). Four people are known to have died while searching for the treasure. New Mexico police have tried to pressure Fenn into ending the hunt. The treasure was found by an unknown person in June 2020. Fenn was born in Temple, Texas. He died on September 7, 2020 in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the age of 90. ==References== ==Other websites== *Old Santa Fe Trading Company, Fenn's business Web site and blog Category:Mysteries Category:June 2020 events",
