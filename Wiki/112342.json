The New York Rangers won the Stanley Cup beating the Montreal Maroons becoming the first United States based team since the start of the NHL to win it and first since the Seattle Metropolitans won in 1917. This season saw the reintroduction of the O'Brien Trophy, which used to go to the NHL league champion. It was originally retired in favour of the Prince of Wales Trophy. The reintroduced O'Brien Trophy went to the winner of the Canadian Division while the Prince of Wales Trophy went to the winner of the American division. ==Regular season== ===Final standings=== Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF= Goals For, GA = Goals Against, PIM = Penalties in minutes Note: Teams that qualified for the playoffs are highlighted in bold Canadian Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Montreal Canadiens 44 26 11 7 59 116 48 496 Montreal Maroons 44 24 14 6 54 96 77 549 Ottawa Senators 44 20 14 10 50 78 57 483 Toronto Maple Leafs 44 18 18 8 44 89 88 436 New York Americans 44 11 27 6 28 63 128 563 American Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Boston Bruins 44 20 13 11 51 77 70 558 New York Rangers 44 19 16 9 47 94 79 462 Pittsburgh Pirates 44 19 17 8 46 67 76 395 Detroit Cougars 44 19 19 6 44 88 79 395 Chicago Black Hawks 44 7 34 3 17 68 134 375 ===Scoring leaders=== Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points Player Team GP G A Pts Howie Morenz Montreal Canadiens 43 33 18 51 Aurel Joliat Montreal Canadiens 44 28 11 39 Frank Boucher New York Rangers 44 23 12 35 George Hay Detroit Cougars 42 22 13 35 Nels Stewart Montreal Maroons 41 27 7 34 Art Gagne Montreal Canadiens 44 20 10 30 Bun Cook New York Rangers 44 14 14 28 Bill Carson Toronto Maple Leafs 32 20 6 26 Frank Finnigan Ottawa Senators 38 20 5 25 Bill Cook New York Rangers 43 18 6 24 Duke Keats Detroit Cougars/Chicago Black Hawks 38 14 10 24 ==Stanley Cup playoffs== ===Playoff bracket=== ===Finals=== New York Rangers vs. Montreal Maroons Date Away Score Home Score Notes April 5 New York Rangers 0 Montreal Maroons 2 April 7 New York Rangers 2 Montreal Maroons 1 (OT) April 10 New York Rangers 0 Montreal Maroons 2 April 12 New York Rangers 1 Montreal Maroons 0 April 14 New York Rangers 2 Montreal Maroons 1 New York wins best- of-five series 3–2 ==NHL awards== 1927–28 NHL awards O'Brien Trophy: Montreal Canadiens Prince of Wales Trophy: Boston Bruins Hart Memorial Trophy: Howie Morenz, Montreal Canadiens Lady Byng Trophy: Frank Boucher, New York Rangers Vezina Trophy: George Hainsworth, Montreal Canadiens ==First games== The following is a list of players of note who played their first NHL game in 1927–28 (listed with their first team, stars(*) mark start in playoffs): *Dit Clapper, Boston Bruins *Norman Gainor, Boston Bruins *Cy Wentworth, Chicago Black Hawks *Charlie Gardiner, Chicago Black Hawks *Larry Aurie, Detroit Cougars *Marty Burke, Montreal Canadiens *Jimmy Ward, Montreal Maroons *Joe Lamb, Montreal Maroons *Marty Barry, New York Americans *Allan Shields, Ottawa Senators *Joe Primeau, Toronto Maple Leafs ==Last games== The following is a list of players of note that played their last game in the NHL in 1927–28 (listed with their last team): *Sprague Cleghorn, Boston Bruins *Corb Denneny, Chicago Black Hawks *Frank Foyston, Detroit Cougars *Jack Walker, Detroit Cougars *Billy Boucher, New York Americans *Odie Cleghorn, Pittsburgh Pirates ==References== *Hockey Database *NHL.com Category:1927 in North America Category:1928 in North America Category:1927 in sports Category:National Hockey League seasons",
