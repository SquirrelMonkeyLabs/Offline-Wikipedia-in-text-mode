 "text": "The Hyundai Grandeur, also known as the Hyundai Azera in North America, is a full-size sedan first introduced in 1986 by Hyundai Motor Company. The Grandeur has seen multiple generations and has been marketed under different names in various regions. The model was aimed at offering a more premium alternative to Hyundai's standard lineup, often competing with other luxury sedans in its class. == First generation (1986–1992) == The Hyundai Grandeur first generation was a rebadged version of the Mitsubishi Debonair produced by Hyundai. It was initially launched with a 2.0L SOHC MPI engine, the same engine used in the first generation Hyundai Sonata, and in 1987, a 2.4L SOHC MPI engine was added. In 1991, to better compete with the Daewoo Imperial, a 3.0L V6 engine model was introduced. Before the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the luxury car market in South Korea was dominated by Daewoo Motors and its Royale Series. Hyundai’s top offering in Korea at the time was the locally built Ford Granada Mark II. However, the Daewoo Royale was leading the market, and Hyundai needed a more competitive luxury model. Initially, Hyundai tried to create a unique design for its luxury vehicle, but facing strong competition from Daewoo, they decided to collaborate with Mitsubishi Motors. Mitsubishi was also looking to update its Debonair, a model that had not been significantly revised since its launch in 1964. Mitsubishi agreed to share the platform, internal configuration, and engine with Hyundai. As an official sponsor of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Hyundai used this opportunity to introduce the Grandeur to executives and important guests. Thanks to its Mitsubishi- based design and features, the Grandeur gained popularity in South Korea. == Second generation (1992–1998) == The second generation of the Hyundai Grandeur was developed in partnership with Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi provided the powertrain, and Hyundai designed the body and interior. Production lasted from September 1992 to 1998. The Grandeur came with V6 engines (2.0L, 2.5L, 3.0L, and 3.5L) and became a major success in Korea, replacing the first generation. However, the same model sold in Japan under the Mitsubishi name was less successful, leading to its early discontinuation there. The success of this model in Korea contributed to its status as a popular choice among politicians and business professionals. == Third generation (1998-2005)== The third- generation Hyundai Grandeur, marketed as the XG in North America and Japan, was developed by Hyundai, building on insights gained from the previous generations, which were rebadged Mitsubishi Debonairs. The Kia Opirus (or Amanti in North America) shared a modified version of the Grandeur/XG platform. After this generation, Hyundai developed future models independently, using the knowledge gained from earlier versions. The XG name was also applied to the domestic Hyundai Trajet, which used the same platform as the Grandeur XG. == Fourth generation (2005–2011) == The fourth-generation Hyundai Azera, known as the Hyundai Grandeur in South Korea, was introduced in 2005 and produced until 2011. It was positioned as a higher-end model compared to the Sonata, featuring a V6 engine, advanced safety features, and an upgraded interior. also sold in North America as the Hyundai Azera. ==Fifith Generation (2011-2017)== The fifth-generation Hyundai Azera (known as the Grandeur in South Korea) was unveiled at the 2011 Los Angeles Auto Show as a 2012 model. It was developed over three and a half years with an estimated budget of $450 million. The Azera was positioned between the Sonata and the rear-wheel-drive Genesis in terms of size and features. The design followed Hyundai’s “fluidic sculpture” philosophy,and it offered both four-cylinder and V6 engine options. In South Korea, it was available with various powertrains, including a 2.4L GDI four-cylinder, 3.0L GDI V6, and a diesel engine, as well as a hybrid version. The hybrid model featured a 2.4L engine paired with an electric motor for improved fuel efficiency. In terms of features, the Azera included technologies such as adaptive cruise control, semi-automatic parking assist, lane departure warning, and blind-spot detection. It was a direct competitor to cars like the Ford Taurus, Dodge Charger, Chevrolet Impala, and entry-level luxury sedans such as the Toyota Avalon and Nissan Maxima the car suffred a facelift in 2014. ==Sixth Generation(2016-2022)== The sixth- generation Hyundai Grandeur was unveiled on October 27, 2016.
