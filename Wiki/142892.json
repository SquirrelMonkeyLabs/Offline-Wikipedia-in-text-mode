 "text": "Ford Cortina was a car produced by Ford Motor Company from 1962 to 1982. It was named after the Italian ski resort of Cortina dâ€™Ampezzo. From 1970 onwards, it was almost identical to Ford Taunus. It was a very popular and common car in the UK during its time. It was still selling well by the time the Sierra replaced it in 1982, but sales of the remaining stocks of the Cortina continued for a while afterwards.
