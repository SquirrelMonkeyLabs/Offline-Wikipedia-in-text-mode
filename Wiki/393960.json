He was previously the 20th Vice President of Venezuela from 2012 and the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2013. Maduro was also the 3rd President of the National Assembly of Venezuela from 2005 to 2006. He became the acting president following the death of Hugo Chávez. On 14 April 2013, Maduro was elected President of Venezuela, narrowly defeating Henrique Capriles, with 1.5% of the vote separating the two candidates. Capriles demanded a recount, refusing to recognize the outcome as valid. However, the result was valid and Maduro was sworn in as president five days later on 19 April. Maduro was born on 13 November 1962 in Caracas, Venezuela. Maduro was raised as a Roman Catholic, and his paternal family ancestry is of Sephardic Jewish origin. He is married to Cilia Flores. Before Maduro became a politician, he was a bus driver in Caracas. In 2013, Maduro denied rumors of homophobia. He stated that if he were gay he would \"shout it to the four winds\". He said that \"I would have no problem loving whoever I had to love with my heart\". He also stated that the Chávez government had supported LGBT rights for the past 14 years, promoting inclusion and non-discrimination. In March 2016, Maduro endorsed United States senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States. In January 2017, Maduro endorsed the murder of Venezuelan dissident Óscar Pérez in what has been named as the Raid in El Junquito. BBC: Oscar Perez killed in El Junquito raid The international media and some politicians & citizens all over the world defined what has happened in El Junquito as a massacre. They harshly criticized about Maduro & his government. Despite calls to resign as president when his first term ended on 10 January 2019, Maduro inaugurated himself. This caused many people to be angry across the world and caused the National Assembly to call for a State of emergency. Many countries removed their embassies from Venezuela. Many believe that his election was illegitimate, they claimed that by retaking power, Maduro was making Venezuela into an illegal de facto dictatorship. In 2022, Maduro has told CGTN that despite the crisis in the country, the economy has grown and will expect to grow more in the coming years. He also said that the crisis is going down. In March 2024, Maduro has confirmed that he'll be running for a third term in the 2024 Venezuelan presidential election. ==References== ==Other websites== *Ministerio del Poder Popular para Relaciones Exteriores (Venezuelan Foreign Ministry) *Biography by CIDOB Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Venezuela Category:Vice presidents of Venezuela Category:Current national leaders Category:Dictators Category:Hindus Category:People from Caracas",
