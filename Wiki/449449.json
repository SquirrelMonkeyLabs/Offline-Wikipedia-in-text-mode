Idols are a separate category of Japanese artists.Fanning the Flames: Fans and Consumer Culture in Contemporary Japan, ed. William W.

Hoover, Historical Dictionary of Postwar Japan (Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2011), p. 202 Japanese idol singers work across genres of the Japanese pop music. This is usually whatever is most popular at the moment. Their songs do not require great singing skills, but the artist must be beautiful, sweet and nice to sing them.

It was thanks to the popularity of young French actress Sylvie Vartan and the movie she played in called Cherchez l'idole (\"Look for the Idol\").
