 "text": "Benzimidazole opioids, also known as nitazenes, are a class of synthetic opioids with an unusual benzimidazole structure; These chemicals are often called opioid NPS (or opioid New Psychoactive Substances). The best known of these opioids is etonitazene. Benzimidazole opioids bind the mu-opioid receptor and may show potency up to several hundred times that of morphine. These opioids have been used in research, and also are being used for drug abuse. Isotonitazine has been implicated in opioid overdose deaths in Europe, Canada, and the United States beginning in 2019. ==List of benzimidazole opioids== *Nitazene; Ring substitution, hydrogen.
