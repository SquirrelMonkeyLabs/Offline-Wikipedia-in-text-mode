She is the youngest of eight children. Her parents were Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Lou Tallulah Grant. Her father, who was, in her words, \"wonderful at math but a terrible farmer,\" earned only $300 a year from sharecropping and dairy farming. Her mother added to the family income by working as a maid.World Authors 1995-2000, 2003. Biography Reference Bank database. Retrieved 2009-04-10. She worked 11 hours a day for USD $17 per week to help pay for Alice to attend college. In 1952, Walker was accidentally hit in the right eye by a BB gun fired by one of her brothers. Because the family had no car, the Walkers could not take their daughter to a hospital for immediate help. By the time they reached a doctor a week later, she had become permanently blind in that eye. When a layer of scar tissue formed over her wounded eye, Alice became self-conscious and painfully shy. She felt like an outcast and turned for comfort to reading and to writing poetry. When she was 14, the scar tissue was removed. She later became valedictorian and was voted most-popular girl, as well as queen of her senior class. After high school, Walker went to Spelman College in Atlanta. She later moved to Sarah Lawrence College near New York City, graduating in 1965. Walker became interested in the U.S. civil rights movement. This was partly due to the influence of activist Howard Zinn, who was one of her professors at Spelman College. Walker returned to the South where she became involved with voter registration drives, campaigns for welfare rights and children's programs in Mississippi.On Finding Your Bliss.

They were married on March 17, 1967 in New York City. Later that year the couple moved to Jackson, Mississippi. They became \"the first legally married inter-racial couple in Mississippi\". They were harassed and threatened by whites, including the Ku Klux Klan. The couple had a daughter Rebecca in 1969. Walker and her husband divorced on friendly terms in 1976. Walker and her daughter grew apart. Rebecca felt herself to be more of \"a political symbol... than a cherished daughter\". She published a memoir called Black White and Jewish, about the complexities of her parents' relationship and her childhood. Rebecca recalls her teenage years when her mother would go to her far-off writing studio while “I was left with money to buy my own meals and lived on a diet of fast food.” Since the birth of Rebecca’s son Tenzin, her mother has not spoken to her. Rebecca has learned that she was cut out of her mother’s will in favor of a distant cousin.Daily Mail article by Rebecca Walker: How my mother's fanatical views tore us apartThe Times article The day feminist icon Alice Walker resigned as my mother .
