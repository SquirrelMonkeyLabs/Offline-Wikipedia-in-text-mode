 "text": "Bythos is a conception in the gnostic philosophy, corresponding to the concept of Monad. It is named that way, to correspond the concept of father, as the father of the autogenes and also the emanator of the first pure emanation barbelo. Bythos itself described as having perfection, and innefability, and all regards corresponding to the concept of monad. He is described as not the creator of the known world, but rather the emanator of the aeons, on which the last and youngest aeon created the abominable one. Bythos itself mentioned in Apocryphon of John. However, Bythos is unclear whether it is personal or not, perhaps it is a personified concept. ==References==",
