 "text": "Rhombichthys is an extinct genus of ellimmichthyiform from the Cenomanian of Palestine that contains only one species, R. intoccabilis. == Description == Rhombichthys is a bizarre-looking fish. It does not exceed 25 cm. The most salient feature is its deep, rhombus-shaped body, hence its generic name. This is likely due to its high dorsal fin, which extends along the major part of the dorsal margin of the body. The mouth was strongly faced upwards, so that the jaws were oriented almost vertically. == References == # Bouziane Khalloufi, René Zaragüeta-Bagils, Hervé Lelièvre (2010). \"Rhombichthys intoccabilis, gen. et sp. nov.
