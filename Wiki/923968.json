She founded several organizations, including ACCESS in Dearborn, Michigan. ==Works== Hassen fought for Muslim rights and feminism within Islam. Even as a child, she didn’t follow what was expected of her. She wrote many works that focused on getting rid of false common ideas about Muslims, Arabs, and Muslim women. She used quotes from the Holy Quran and the Prophet Muhammad as evidence. Hassen also participated in protests to support Arabs. Along with her husband, Ali Hassen, she started the Egyptian Arab American Seaman’s Society to spread the message of Islam to the wider public and support Arab- American Muslims. She also began another organization, the Islamic Sorority, to give a safe space for Muslim women and their children to practice Islam. Hassen held leading roles in other Islamic organizations, such as the Islamic Center of New York and the Federation of Islamic Associations. Hassen became friendly with many important Muslim and Arab people, such as Malcolm X, and the Saudi prince Talal bin Abdulaziz. She wrote multiple works about Muslim feminism, like “Feminine Participation in Islamic Affairs.” Her work reached many people and changed their ideas on Arab-Americans, Muslims, and Islamic feminism. == References == Category:1910 births Category:1990 deaths Category:American Muslims Category:American feminists",
