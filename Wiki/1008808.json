 "text": "Asena is the name of a she-wolf associated with the myth of the origin of Göktürks, mentioned in \"Wolf Tales\" recorded by Chinese chroniclers. The legend of Asena tells of a boy who survived the battle; the she-wolf Asena finds the injured child and nurses it, flees her enemies by crossing the West Sea to a cave near the Kocho Mountains and the town of Toharach. Of these, Jizhi Nishidu became their leader and established the Ashina clan, which ruled Göktürk and other Turkic nomadic kingdoms. ==References== *http://web.mst.edu/~gdoty/poems/altaic/index.html *http://www.cangoknil.com/english/essays/creation.html *http://www.freenet.kg/kyrgyzstan/manas.html *http://freenet.bishkek.su/kyrgyzstan/epos.html *http://www.bookrags.com/history/dastan-turkic-ema-02/ *http://www.necatidemir.net/ *https://archive.org/details/Turkish-Turkic- Mythology-Glossary-Dictionary *http://www.tuerkische-sagen.de/ *http://tufak.org.tr/halkbilimivefolklor.htm ==Related pages== * Mythology (book) * Social psychology",
