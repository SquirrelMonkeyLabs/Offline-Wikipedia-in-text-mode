Some scientists think it also lives in Argentina. ==Home== Scientists found this frog in a place that has cold grassland, islands, and forest. Scientists think the frog might live inside Laguna San Rafael National Park. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out, but human beings do not go to its home much, so human beings probably do not affect it the way we affect other frogs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
