 "text": "Women are part of society. The society they are in expects that they take certain actions, or they behave in certain ways. They have obligations. Much as they have obligations, they also claim to have certain rights. These rights are called women's rights. ==Overview== The claims are the basis for the women's rights movement in the 19th century and the feminist movement from the 20th to 21st century. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local customs and behavior. In other countries, women's rights are suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights by claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.Hosken, Fran P., 'Towards a Definition of Women's Rights' in Human Rights Quarterly, Vol. 3, No. 2. (May 1981), pp. 1–10. ==Ideas== The idea what rights women and girls have has changed over time. It is also different, in different parts of the world. Today, girls and women generally want the following rights:Lockwood, Bert B. (ed.), Women's Rights: A \"Human Rights Quarterly\" Reader (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006), . * Bodily integrity, their body belongs to them * Autonomy, they are free, and within certain limits can decide what to do * They are not subjected to violence, especially not sexual violence * They are able to work outside the household, and they will get recognition for the work they do * When they reach a certain age, they want to be able to vote, and to be elected. This is generally called women's suffrage * They want reproductive rights. Usually this means they want to decide if they have children, and with who they have them. This is usially called family planning. They also want to have access to birth control – also called contraception) – and the right to abortion * When it comes to law, there should not be a difference between a man and a woman * The want the right to own property * They want the right to get an education ==Current issues== Even today, societies are different: In many societies, women do not get all of these rights. Some of these rights are also subject to debates. ===Abortion=== The Abortion debate is about if women should get the right to abortion and under what circumstances. Similarly, in certain societies, men have a lot of power. Such societies are called paternalistic. ===Violence against women=== Violence against women may be commonplace, and the state will not do much against it. ==Related pages== * Feminism * Sharia law * Egalitarianism * Lesbian feminism * Women's empowerment ==References== Category:Women's rights",
