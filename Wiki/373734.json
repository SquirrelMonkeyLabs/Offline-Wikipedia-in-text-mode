 "text": "Mount Zion (, Har Tsiyyon; , Jabel Sahyoun) is a hill in the south-west corner of the Old City of Jerusalem. It is an extension of Temple Mount. There are a lot of churches and many little Christians and Jewish cemeteries in the area of Mount Zion. Half of the Mount Zion is in the Old City, in the Jewish and Armenian Quarters. The grave of King David is at the top of Mount Zion. In the past there was a small cable car that connected the mountain to the valley below and the Old City. Today the cable car room is a museum inside an old hospital building. == Other websites == * the Mount Zion Cable Car in the Gems in Israel website * the Mount Zion Cable Car in mycountry israel website == Gallery == File:Jerusalem, Zion Gate.JPG|Zion Gate File:Jerusalem Tomb of David BW 1.JPG|King David Tomb File:Last Supper Room Panoramic.jpg|Cenacle File:Kidron jerusalem (110).JPG|Mount Zion Cable Car File:Entrance to Chamber of the Holocaust.jpg|Chamber of the Holocaust File:פתח אחת ממערות הגניזה כפי שצולם בשנת 1995.jpg|Sambuski Cemetery - ancient jewish cemetery File:Mount Zion Franciscan Cemetery Jerusalem 03326.JPG|Mount Zion Franciscan Cemetery File:Christian cemetery on Mt.
