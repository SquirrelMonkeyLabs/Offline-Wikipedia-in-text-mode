 "text": "Primogeniture is the system of inheritance by the firstborn, usually the eldest son. In feudal England and other legal systems, the legitimate first- born son gets the first right to inherit property. His claim is stronger than all daughters, younger sons and even elder illegitimate sons. The rule is that the eldest will always have the first claim. If there is no son, each of the daughters inherit an equal share of the estate. If there are no children, the property is often inherited by the eldest brother. Among siblings, sons inherit before daughters and so on. Primogeniture is Latin for \"first born\". == References == Category:Law",
