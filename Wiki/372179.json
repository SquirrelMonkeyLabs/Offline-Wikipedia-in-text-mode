 "text": "Judah Maccabee was a Jewish patriot who led a Jewish rebellion (the Maccabees) against the Seleucid Empire. Judah opposed the Seleucid Emperor's attempts to suppress traditional Jewish culture and make the Jewish people more Greek- like. He liberated Jerusalem, removed Greek idols from the Temple, and rededicated the Temple to the Jewish God. Judah died in combat, but the rebellion that he had led did not stop. The rebellion's success led to the reestablishment of the kingdom of Judah.
