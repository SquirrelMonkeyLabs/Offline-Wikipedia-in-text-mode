 "text": "Led Zeppelin is the first album from English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 12 January 1969. The album was recorded in 1968 and is notable for being one of the most influential albums of all time, especially inspiring future heavy metal and hard rock bands. The album did not get good reviews by critics in 1969 but the album still sold many copies, today, the album is generally seen as a rock classic. On the album, guitarist and producer Jimmy Page used many different techniques to get a unique sound. For example, he recorded the instruments from far away instead of putting the microphone right in front of the amplifier or drum set, this gives a different sound, like it sounds in the room when it was played. ==Song listing== == Other websites == Official website Category:Led Zeppelin albums Category:Debut albums Category:1969 albums Category:Blues rock albums Category:Heavy metal albums",
