 "text": "British Columbia Highway 101 is a highway that travels along the Salish Sea between Langdale and Lund with two sections of land divided by the ferry in between. The highway may look it is an extension of U.S. Route 101, but it is away between these two highways and therefore BC-101's highway may not be related to US-101's highway. The road is about in length. ==Related pages== *U.S. Route 101 Category:British Columbia provincial highways",
