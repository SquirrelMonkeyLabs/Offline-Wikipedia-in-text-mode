The allies from Miranzai were given the lands watered from the upper springs under the hills (known as Bhawanna, &c; .) The villages fringing the hills, Jangal, Pir Khel, Mansur Khel, Shekhan, Mir Ahmad Khel and Togh are still held by these Miranzai sections, while the villages below Kohat (Behzadi, Garhi Mawaz, &c; . ) are held by the real Daulat Khel. == Main divisions of the Daulat Khel == The main divisions of the Daulat Khel were Malik Miri, Behzadi, Karimdadi and Allahdadi . A quarrel arose some time after between the two first and the two last about the Jhang katta (water-course) which runs just south of Kohat. The Karimdadis and Allahdadis were beaten and most of them removed to Chach Hazara, where many of their descendants are still to be found. The Malik Miris and Bazadis had plenty of land of their own. The lands of the beaten sections to a great extent became waste and were afterwards given to non-proprietary cultivators of other tribes, principally Awáns. These tenants were not considered at Settlement entitled to the status of proprietors, and much of the original Karimdadi and Allahdadi land was consequently recorded as Crown property. == Behzadi Division == The most leading section among the Daulat Khel is that of the Behzadi, who are divided again into the Janas Khel, Tar Khel and Gula Khel.

Among the Shahwali Khel, the leading families are the Izzat Khel and at a long interval the Shinu Khel. The family of the Kháns of Baizai belong to the Izzat Khel branch. Khel live principally in Garhi Mawaz Khán.

He was murdered by Ahmed Fatteh Khán Khel, who was almost immediately afterwards killed by Ismail Khán's Purbiah followers and . Sher Muhammad Khan, a famous scion of the Bangash chiefs, performed such exemplary feats of bravery and bravery that the ruler of the time, Aurangzeb Alamgir, was pleased and gave him the Shahi Talat Arabian breed horse and one hundred thousand rupees as a cash reward. Now it is a matter of great surprise and regret that the new generation is not even familiar with the name of Sher Muhammad Khan, although the great personality is buried in a nearby place in Kohat district at Regi Sikandar Khel, which is now also called Regi Shinokhel.Janan Baba shrine has spiritual charisma, here are buried such great dervishes of spirituality and Sufism. Whose greatness will remain forever. Pir Kabuli Baba and his friends are resting here. These eminent personalities are actually buried in the graveyard of Ziarat Sher Muhammad Khan Shaheed, the eleventh Sardar of Tapa Bai Zai of Malik Miri Division Sher Muhammad Khan Bangash Bangash. Sher Muhammad Khan Bangash, who was martyred in India Hyderabad Dakan in 1690 at the end of the 16th century while oppressing the Marathas, and from there a few Janissar Ghazi companions of the army brought him to his native land and buried him with the funeral prayer led by the great spiritual figure Haji Bahadur Sahib. were given Sher Muhammad Khan showed his bravery many times in the battles of right and wrong. When the Mughal rule was at its height in the subcontinent, like other famous people, Sher Muhammad Khan was also an important and well-known chief in the eyes of the Mughal ruler, and during this time he was sent to other areas to deal with internal and external rebellions. Due to his excellent war strategy, he always excelled in these war skills.

In 1660, when Khushal Khan Khattak returned from Tirah to Kohat after fighting the wars of the Enlightenment movement, Dur Bibi, the mother of Sher Muhammad Khan Bangash, invited and feasted him on behalf of the Bangash tribe, maintaining her traditions. At that time, Sher Muhammad Khan Bangash, the chief of the Bangash tribe, was detained in the Gwalior Fort. When Mahabat Khan became the governor of Peshawar, Sher Muhammad Khan Bangash was released.Sher Muhammad Khan Bangash was active in many battles and performed great feats of bravery and bravery in a few battles of that time with the regional tribes. In which the most notable happened in 1684 near Kohat with Darya Khan Afridi and Tatar Khan Afridi.He also fought many battles with Khushal Khan Khattak, including the Shadi Khel, Dhoda battle and especially the Gumbat battle of 1686, the reason of which Khushal Khan Khattak called (BelaleyTange) which is now read as BiliTang. == Jahangir Khan Bangash == Jahangir Khan Bangash, a descendant of Behzadi , is the first of the Tar Khel clan.

He was the Contemporary of Hazrat Haji Bahadur and Emporer Aurangzeb. == Izzat Khan Bangash == Izzat Khán had six sons, the principal of whom were Azmat, Larmast, Zabardast, and Musahib. Azmat Khán was the eldest , but though there are one or two sannads addressed to him it seems doubtful whether he ever succeeded to the Khánship. Larmast Khán is said to have succeeded his father. He accompanied Ahmed Shah Abdalli to Hindustan and got the title of Baz Jang Kuli Khán for good service in the Cashmere campaign. He was given a jagir in the neighbourhood of Gujrat. He was eventually killed in the Mahratta war. He was succeeded by his brother Zabardast Khán, who had governed Kohat Zabardast Khán during the absence of Larmast in Hindustan. Zabardast was the most powerful of the Baizai Kháns. He ruled over the country from the Indus to Biland Khel on the Kurram. Zabardast was employed in Cashmere during the time of the rebellion of Azad Khán ( A. D. 1787) in the reign of Timúr Shah. He had written to the king offering to seize Azád Khán, but the letter was intercepted by Azad Khán, who put him to death. He was succeeded by his son Nawáb Khán, who re-venged his father Zabardast. He slew Azád Khán and cutting off his head, brought it back with him to Kohat. He oppressed the people, so the King dismissed him, and appointed in his stead Azizulla, the son of Musahib, son of Izzat Khán. Nawáb Khán, however, fought with Azizulla at Bhawalgarh (near Dhoda) and overthrew him. Many were slain and Nawab regained the chiefship. He was afterwards murdered by his sons , Khán Bahadur, Shahwalli and Baz Gul, assisted by Miran Shah (father of the present Yusuf Shah Mian Khel). Khán Bahadur Khán had suspected his father Nawáb Khán of an intrigue with his own wife, hence the conspiracy against the latter. Khán Bahadar ruled for three driven out by Azizulla Khán. Khán Bahadar succeeds, but is supplanted by Azizulla . years, after which he was Azizulla was chief in A. D. 1809 at the time of the visit of Mr. Elphinstone, who mentions his son Umr Khán ; also the fact that the little fort of Kohat had lately been ruined by the internecine war between the chiefs . Struggles for the chief- ship. 6. After an interval of three years Kalandar Khán, a son of Lashkar Khan's, who was one of Khán Bahadar's adherents, attacked Azizulla Khán near Togh, but was defeated and killed . The defeated party however rallied at once and drove back Azizulla Khán to Kohát. Khán Bahadar the Bangash clan to his side and drove Azizulla altogether. He fled to Ziarat Shekh Allahdad in Zira, where he was slain while praying in the mosque, by a party of Khán Bahadar's followers ,among them Sher Ali Khán, father of the late Nawab Bahadar Sher Khán, who was grandson to Azmat Khán, already mentioned as eldest son of Izzat Khán. After the death of Azizulla Khán there was great confusion . Sometimes Khán Bahadar was chief ; sometimes his elder brother Ismail, who had been a hostage with the King Shah Zaman at Kabul at the time of his father's murder ; sometimes Umr Khán, son of Azizulla Khán.This lasted till the second reign of Mahmud Shah. After Shah Mahomed Sultán appointed Governor of Kohat. Baizai Kháns reduced to a subordinate position. Position of Sher Ali Khán. Shuja's flight in 1810, Mahomed Sultán, brother of Mahmud Shah, was appointed Governor of Kohat, and the Baizai Kháns lost their semi-independent position . Sher Ali Khán, already mentioned as one of the murderers of Azizulla, now became the leading man of the family, and generally held a large part of the country in lease subordinate to the local rulers. When Kohat was granted in jagir to Sirdar Sultán Mahomed Khán in 1836 he married the daughter of Sher Ali Khán. This girl was half sister to Sher Ali's elder sons Fatteh and Sharbat, and full sister to the younger sons Bahadar Sher and Atta Khan. Sultán Mahomed Khántreated Sher Ali Khán with great consideration . Sher Ali Khán died about 1844 A.D. He was succeeded in his leases by his eldest son Fatteh Khán, but after two years Fatteh Khán was dismissed in favor of Bahadar Sher Khán. Bahadar Sher Khán, probably through the in- fluence of the latter's sister. At annexation Bahadar Sher Khán fell into trouble with his revenue and fled to the hills . He was recalled by Captain Coke and placed in charge of the Kohat pass. He was granted a jagir, and after the pass blockade ( 1876-77 ) he was made a Nawáb. On his death in 1880 his brother Atta Khán was appointed to act for him. The sons of the elder brothers Fatteh Khán and Sharbat Khán live quietly at Bahadar Kot. In social position they are hardly above the ordinary zemindar. One of Sharbat's sons Mehr Ali Khán holds a somewhat better position as Jail darogha. His death in 1880. Position of other members of this family. A short account of Náwab Bahadar Sher Khán's family has been given in my remarks on the leading families of the district. 7. With the exception of Sher Ali's family all the other Izzat Khels have sunk into comparative obscurity. I shall men- tion a few of them on account of the interest attaching to them as descendants of men once celebrated. Gholam Khán, lambardar of Kálú Chína, is the grandson of Lashkari Khán, son of the Chief Larmast Khán, who was a minor when his father died and was in consequence superseded by his uncle Zabardast Khán. Lashkari Khán planted the picturesque garden behind the Deputy Commissioner's house. The descendants of Zabardast Khán have almost disappeared. Atta Mahomed Khán, the grandson of the Chief Khán Bahadar, was a sergeant in the police. He was murdered at Marai in 1877. His son Zakhariah now holds a small appointment in the border police. Atta Khán, jagirdar of the little village of Miri, is the head of the family of Musahib Khán. He is son of the chief Umr Khán. He is a Deputy Inspector of Police in the Peshawar district. == References == Category:Cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa",
