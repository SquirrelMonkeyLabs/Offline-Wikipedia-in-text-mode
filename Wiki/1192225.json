 "text": "Technological convergence means that different technologies, which are usually unrelated, are changed so that they can work together more easily. The modern smartphone can be seen as an example for this: Today, most smartphones combine a telephone, a watch, a digital camera, a GPS sensor and a flashlight. All these technologies are unrelated, but in the smarphone they are combined into one device. Other examples are the convergence of telephony and the internet, or television and the internet.
