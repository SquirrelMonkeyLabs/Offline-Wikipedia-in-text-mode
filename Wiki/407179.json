The currency is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China.Article 2, Its name means \"people's currency\". The main unit of renminbi is the yuán. One yuan is divided into 10 jiǎo. One jiǎo is subdivided into 10 fēn. Renminbi banknotes are available in denominations from 1 jiao to 100 yuan (¥0.1–100). Coins have denominations from 1 fen to 1 yuan (¥0.01–1). Some denominations exist in both coin and banknote form. Coins under ¥0.1 are rarely used. Currently, only ¥20,000 can be taken in or out of China without declaring it, or telling customs that you have it. ==References== ==More reading== * Ansgar Belke, Christian Dreger und Georg Erber: Reduction of Global Trade Imbalances: Does China Have to Revalue Its Currency?
