 "text": "A bellows camera is a type of camera designed during a time when photos were produced in a process called \"daguerreotype\" (years 1840-1850). With many improvements, this type of camera is still in use today, especially by many people who do vintage photography as a hobby, or who like the design for its aesthetic. It is named for its flexible bellows that protects the film from exposure. These bellows connect two adjustable frames â€“ the frontal one with the lens, and the other on the back of the camera with a glass screen that will be replaced by a frame holding photographic film so that one can take a photo. The bellows is flexible, with an accordion fold. It covers the space between the lens and the film, and flexes to accommodate frame movements. The front frame is a plate at the front of the camera that holds the lens and usually a shutter. On the back side of the camera, there is a glass screen with a rough texture, used to focus and compose the image before exposure. This glass is replaced by the camera operator with either sensitive film, a photographic plate, or a digital image sensor. The front and rear frames can be moved in various ways relative to each other, unlike most other types of cameras. This allows to control the focus, depth of field and perspective. The camera is normally used with a tripod or a similar type of support. == Bellows == In photography, the bellows is a foldable part that is used in large and medium format photographic cameras, to allow the movement of the lenses with respect to the focal plane for a suitable focus, used in certain camera models such as the one in the picture.. There are two types of bellows: * Bag bellows, usually used in cameras with lenses of short focal length * Square bellows, for cameras with a lens of greater focal length == References == Category:Cameras",
