 "text": "Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, the country has used four main systems of vehicle registration plates. The first system was introduced in 1992 and was based on the last Soviet Union's license plate conception, regulated by the 1977 standard, but with the addition of some new regional suffix corresponding to a Ukrainian province. On 1 July 1995, the introduction of a completely new system consisting of five digits, with a little dash between the third and fourth digit, combined with a two letter suffix. It also included a two-digit region code, located under the National Flag on the left- hand side of the number plate. In order to enable drivers using their vehicle abroad, and in order to adhere to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, Ukrainian regular license plates use only those Cyrillic characters where the glyph resembles a letter from the Roman alphabet; a total of 12 characters: А, В, Е, І, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, Х).
