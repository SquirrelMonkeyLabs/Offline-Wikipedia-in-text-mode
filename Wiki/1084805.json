 "text": "The Charpa tree frog or Nagercoil whipping frog (Polypedates occidentalis) is a frog. It lives in India. People have seen it in the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve and Charpa Forest Range in Kerala. People have seen it between 100 and 1100 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests, both forests that have never been cut down and forests that have been cut down and then grew back. It can also live on farms and in places where humans live. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people are changing the place where it lives. Scientists say this frog is related to P. cruciger, P. pseudocruciger, and P. maculatus. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
