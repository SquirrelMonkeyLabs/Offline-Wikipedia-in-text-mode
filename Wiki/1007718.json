 "text": "The St Luke Passion (), BWV 246, is a musical composition. Its author is not known. It was thought that Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the passion. However, the style of the composition is different from Bach's style. == History == The manuscript of the St Luke Passion was written by Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Franz Hauser bought the manuscript in the early 19th century. He thought that Johann Sebastian Bach was the author of the composition. He asked Felix Mendelssohn for his opinion. Mendelssohn thought that Bach was not the author of the composition. He pointed out that a chorale did not fit Bach's style. It was thought that Bach copied the Passion setting to be performed in Leipzig in 1730. However, this has been proven to be false. == References == Category:Choral compositions",
