 "text": "Marvel Noir is a 2009â€“2010 Marvel Comics alternative continuity combining elements of film noir and pulp fiction with the Marvel Universe. The central premise of the mini-series replaces superpowers with driven, noir-flavored characterization. The reality of Marvel Noir is Earth-90214. A universe where local counterparts of Earth-616 superhumans debuted in the 1920s and 1930s. Most superpowers are mainly unknown or nonexistent at this point, though with the certain exceptions of few, such as Spider-Man (who received his powers from a mystical \"Spider God\"), Black Cat, and Daredevil. The stories in the Marvel Noir universe are written and illustrated in the style of film noir, an American style of filmmaking typically associated with crime dramas. It uses a low-key, black-and-white style of filmmaking with stylistic cues taken from German Expressionism, and story and narrative tropes inspired by hardboiled detective fiction.
