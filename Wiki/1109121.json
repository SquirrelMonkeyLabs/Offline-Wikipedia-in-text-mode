 "text": "In sports, a reserve team is a team of players who have a contract with a club, but who do not normally play in matches for the main (first) team. Reserve teams often use alternative players from the first team, young players who need more time playing to get better, and sometimes players from first team who are recovering from injury. In some countries, reserve or development teams play in separate competitions from the first teams. Other countries let reserve teams play in the same league system as their club's first team, although usually in different divisions (levels). == References == Category:Sports words Category:Team sports",
