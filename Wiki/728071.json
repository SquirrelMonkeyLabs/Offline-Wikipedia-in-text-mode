The original members were: Mikael Danielsson (guitar), Jimmie Olsson (vocals, drums) and Henrik Sunvisson (bass guitar). The name came from the Sex Pistols' version of The Stooges' song \"No Fun\" and the name of the band Sick of It All. The group released their albums on the Swedish label Burning Heart Records outside the United States. In the U.S., No Fun at All's albums were released by Theologian Records and later by Epitaph Records. In 1993, Jimmie Olsson left the band to work on his other band Sober. No Fun at All then added three new members: Ingemar Jansson (vocals), Krister Johansson (guitar) and Kjell Ramstedt (drums). In 1999, Sunvisson left No Fun at All.
