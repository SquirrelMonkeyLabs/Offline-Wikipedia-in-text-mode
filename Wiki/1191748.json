 "text": "A Paphal, also spelled as Pafal (), or Paphan or Pafan (), is a Meitei traditional symbolic representation, resembling pythons, varying in shape and color. These illustrations are closely linked to Meitei cosmology, mythology, clan identity, and ritual practices of traditional Meitei religion (Sanamahism) of Manipur.Meeyamgi Kholao: Sprout of Consciousness. N.p.: ARECOM ( Advanced Research Consortium, Manipur), 2014. p. 92 Notably, the Paphal Lambuba (), a traditional illustrated manuscript, contains depictions of 364 Paphals. The Paphal cult holds a significant place in the religious and cultural framework of the Meitei community. Its influence is evident across various aspects of Meitei life, including visual arts, architecture, pottery, martial practices, and performing arts. The presence of Paphal imagery and symbolism in these domains reflects the integration of the cult into the collective consciousness and traditional expressions of the community. == Clan color codes == The Meitei society is traditionally divided into seven clans (yek-salai), each associated with a specific color. These color codes are reflected in the Paphal illustrations corresponding to each clan.Bahadur, Mutua. Illustrated Manuscripts of Manipur. India: Mutua Museum, 2005. == Symbolism and beliefs == Paphals are believed to possess supernatural powers. They frequently incorporate mystic symbols, Meitei alphabets, and sacred hymns within and around the figure. In the past, Paphal drawings were placed above the main entrance of homes to ward off evil spirits. The typical Paphal shows a python biting its own tail, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life, the unity of creation and creator, and universal harmony. The intertwined body is interpreted as representing the union of male and female as sources of life. == Types of Paphal == Paphals are broadly categorized into three types: 1\\. Tail-Biting Python: Represents serenity and cosmic order. 2\\. Non-Tail-Biting Python: Conveys fear, aggression, or disturbance. 3\\. Other Belly-Crawling Creatures: Depict animals like lizards; traditional texts such as Ningthou fi Saba suggest that all belly-crawling creatures were once considered types of pythons. == Subtypes by head position == The position of the python's head creates three subtypes: * Upper Position: Signifies high intellectual achievement. * Middle Position: Indicates calmness and self-control. * Bent Backward: Suggests adaptability and the ability to function in both spiritual and worldly realms. == Cultural practices == In traditional Meitei martial arts, specific Paphal patterns guide body movements with spears, depending on whether the action is offensive or defensive. During the Lai Haraoba festival, ritual leaders including maiba (priests), maibi (priestesses), and pena sakpa (musicians) lead a dance mimicking the curves of the Paphal to invoke prosperity and well-being for the community and future generations. == Gallery == Different Paphal designs of (2) Tillikok Sitapa Pakhangba - Immortal Essence, (3) General Coiling Form, (4) Pallandabi - Drawing used in ritual - Classical cultural heritage of Ancient Kangleipak civilisation state.jpg Ibudhou Pakhangba Paphal.jpg Kangla Thon 7 Thollangmei.jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of Ningthouja winged dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of Ningthouja Pakhangba dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of Luwang dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of Khaba Nganpa Pakhangba dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of Khaba serpentine dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of Khuman serpentine dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg Classical Meitei illuminated manuscript painting — depicting a “Paphal” of 4 limbed Khaba dragon — from the “Pakhangba Lambuba”, an Ancient Meetei language text (engraved in traditional Meetei Mayek writing system).jpg == Related pages == * Taoroinai * Poubi Lai * Pakhangba * Meitei royal etiquette * Meitei deities == Bibliography == * Mutua Bahadur, Manuscript Paintings of Manipur, published by M.
