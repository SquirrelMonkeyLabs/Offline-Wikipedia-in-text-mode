This area was known in Greek as Media or MedeaΜηδία, Old Persian ; adjective Median, antiquated also Medean). Under Assyrian rule, the Medes were known as Mādāyu. They entered this region with the first wave of Iranian tribes, in the late second millennium BC (at the end of the Bronze Age).Daniel J Hopkins, Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary, p. 527, 1997, By the 6th century BC, the Medes were able to make their own empire.
