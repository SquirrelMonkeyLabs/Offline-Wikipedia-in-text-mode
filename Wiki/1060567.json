 "text": "Reclaim the Night is a movement that started in 1977. It is part of the Women's liberation movement. The people who started it said that women should be able to walk safely at night. The focus of the movement is still to decrease the number of times women get sexually assaulted. Over the years, Reclaim the Night also targeted other forms of violence against women. The first of these marches was in Brussels, in 1976. On Walpurgis Night 1977, women marched through the streets. Many of them were dressed as witches. During that march, many went to the red light districts, and into places women usually don't have access to. Category:Social movements Category:1977",
