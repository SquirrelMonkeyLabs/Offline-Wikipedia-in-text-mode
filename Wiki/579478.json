They offer training, awards programs, and legal advice to women journalists. They have members in more than 100 countries. == Programs == The IWMF was started in 1990 to increase freedom of speech by supporting women working in the media. Their objectives are to build a network of women to share ideas, to give women the skills to become leaders, to help women expand their careers, and to honor bravery and courage with the Courage in Journalism and Lifetime Achievement Awards. The foundation sponsors several events and financial aid funds, including advanced training and grants, to assist and promote women in journalism. == Research == In 2013, the International Womenâ€™s Media Foundation studied women journalists. They found that two-thirds of women journalists in the world have experienced harassment or abuse in their work. Most of them do not report these problems because they are afraid. They also publish safety and security recommendations for women journalists. * Summary of IWMF study * \"Violence and harassment against women in the news media: a global picture\" - text * Recommendations for women journalists (IWMF) ==Related pages== * Courage in Journalism Award == References == == Other websites == * International Women's Media Foundation official website Category:Journalism Category:Non-profit organizations of Washington, D.C.",
