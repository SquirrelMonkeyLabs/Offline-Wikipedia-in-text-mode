Lee became a soldier in the American Revolution and tried to become the leader even though George Washington got that job instead. General Lee won his early fights but then lost the Battle of Monmouth and was fired from the army. Lee died of tuberculosis in 1782. In the 1850s, some historians started to think that Lee had committed treason by secretly helping the British against the Revolution. ==In Popular Culture== In the television show Turn, Lee is a spy for the British Empire and in Hamilton, Lee fights a duel against John Laurens.
