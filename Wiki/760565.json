 "text": "The Man Who Laughs is a 1928 American silent romantic drama movie directed Paul Leni. The movie is based of Victor Hugo's 1869 novel of the same name and stars Mary Philbin as the blind Dea and Conrad Veidt as Gwynplaine. The movie is known for the grim carnival freak-like grin. Critic Roger Ebert said, \"The Man Who Laughs is a melodrama, at times even a swashbuckler, but so steeped in Expressionist gloom that it plays like a horror film.\" ==References== Category:1928 drama movies Category:1920s American romance movies Category:1920s horror movies Category:1920s American drama movies Category:American romantic drama movies Category:American horror movies Category:Movies based on books",
