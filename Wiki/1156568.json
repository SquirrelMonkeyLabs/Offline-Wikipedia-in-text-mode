 "text": "Shoe polish, also known as boot polish and shoeshine, is a waxy paste, cream, or liquid that is used to polish, shine, and waterproof leather shoes or boots. This is done to extend the footwear's lifespan and restore its appearance. Shoe polishes are distinguished by their textures, which range from liquids to hard waxes. Solvent, waxes, and colorants comprise most shoe polishes.Shoe polishes have been around since the Middle Ages. Originally made with dubbin, they were only used to soften leather and weather proof shoes, they did not shine shoes. Shoe shining became popular in early 20th century. This that arose during the early 1900s led to many shoe polish formulas being incorporated with a shining agent. == References == Category:Everyday life Category:Chemicals",
