 "text": "The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany (German: Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, abbreviated EKD) is a group of 20 regional churches. They are made up of two Reformed (Calvinist), 9 Lutheran and 9 United (Lutheran- Reformed) churches. The Moravian Church and the Federation of Evangelical Reformed Congregations are associate members. The Evangelical Church in Germany is not a church like the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. This is because it is not one big church which share the same system of beliefs, instead it is a collection of churches which allow its members to share in church services and worship. == Other websites == * Evangelical Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland) Category:Calvinism Category:Lutheranism Category:Protestantism in Germany",
