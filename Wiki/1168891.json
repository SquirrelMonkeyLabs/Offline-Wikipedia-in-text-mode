 "text": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with the other type being Crohn's disease. It is a long-term condition that causes inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The main symptoms of the disease are abdominal pain and diarrhea mixed with blood. Weight loss, fever, and anemia can also happen. Symptoms come on slowly and can be either mild to severe. Symptoms usually happen between periods of no symptoms and flares. Problems may include an enlarged colon (megacolon), inflammation of the eye, joints, or liver, and colon cancer. The cause of UC is unknown. Some possible causes include genetics, environment, and an overactive immune system. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the digestive system",
