A sequel to the film, which was called The Boss Baby: Family Business was released in 2021. Another sequel to the film is also in development. ==Plot== A new baby's arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator -- a wildly imaginative 7-year-old named Tim. The most unusual Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) arrives at Tim's home in a taxi, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. The instant sibling rivalry must soon be put aside when Tim discovers that Boss Baby is actually a spy on a secret mission, and only he can help thwart a dastardly plot that involves an epic battle between puppies and babies. == Voice cast == * Miles Bakshi as Timothy \"Tim\" Templeton * Alec Baldwin as Theodore \"Ted\" Templeton/The Boss Baby * Jimmy Kimmel as Ted Templeton * Steve Buscemi as Francis E.
