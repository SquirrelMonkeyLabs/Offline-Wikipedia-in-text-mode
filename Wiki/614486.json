 "text": "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) refers to any of a number of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. An infection of this type can be called as an upper respiratory tract infection (URI or URTI) or a lower respiratory tract infection (LRI or LRTI). Lower respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, tend to be far more serious conditions than upper respiratory infections, such as the common cold. The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea (wind pipe), bronchial tubes, the bronchioles, and the lungs. Lower respiratory tract infections are generally more serious than upper respiratory infections. LRIs are the leading cause of death among all infectious diseases. They can be bronchitis or pneumonia. ==References== Category:Infectious diseases",
