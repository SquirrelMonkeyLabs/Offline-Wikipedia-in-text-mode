The other students in Proclus' school were Rufinus (high-level Athenian official), Severianus (provincial governor), Pamprepius (lecturer and supporter of Illus' rebellion), Marcellinus (patrician and magister militum of Dalmatia), Anthemius (Roman consul and emperor), and Flavius Messius Phoebus Severus (consul, patrician and prefect of Rome). In 465, Pusaeus held the position of praetorian prefect of the East.. In 467, he was a consul while Anthemius was head of the Western Roman Empire. In Constantinople, there is an inscription in Latin surrounded by inscriptions in Greek that reads: \"Pusaeus, no less than the great Anthemius, strengthened towers and walls\".. Pusaeus died sometime before 486. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:5th-century people Category:Roman people",
