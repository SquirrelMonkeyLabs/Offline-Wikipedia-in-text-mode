 "text": "The Lima rocket frog (Hyloxalus littoralis) is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== It is easier for people to hear this frog than to see it. This frog lives in dry places, including places where small, woody plants grow and dry places near the ocean. This frog lives near streams with many plants growing nearby. This frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. Scientists saw these frogs between 665 and 2800 meters above sea level. People have seen the frog in one protected park: Pantanos de Villa Reserved Zone. ==Young== This frog has young in water that does not move, near streams but not in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. People build farms near its home, but scientists do not think this hurts the frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
