It used to cover all five boroughs of New York City, including the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island boroughs, but after it was split by 718 in 1984, which covers those boroughs of New York City, 212 is now restricted to the Manhattan borough of New York City. It was overlaid by 917 in 1992 which covers the entirety of New York City, 646 in 1999, and 332 in 2017. == References == 212",
