It has been the home stadium of football club Atlético Madrid since the 2017–18 season. The stadium is in the Rosas neighbourhood in the San Blas-Canillejas district. Wanda Metropolitano has a seating capacity of 67,828. The stadium was built during 1990–93 and was opened in 1994. After the stadium was closed in 2004, the stadium reopened in 2017 as Atlético Madrid's home ground. Metropolitano Stadium replaced their former home ground Vicente Calderón Stadium. The first match in the stadium was on 18 September 2017 in a 2017-18 La Liga match against Málaga CF. The stadium was formerly known as Estadio de la Comunidad de Madrid (Madrid Community Stadium), Estadio Olímpico de Madrid (Madrid Olympic Stadium), and more commonly by its nickname Estadio de La Peineta (The Comb Stadium). The naming rights were bought by a Chinese real estate company called Wanda Group, so the stadium was called the Wanda Metropolitano until 2022. On 1 June 2019, Metropolitano Stadium hosted the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Buildings and structures in Madrid Category:Football stadiums in Spain Category:1994 establishments in Europe",
