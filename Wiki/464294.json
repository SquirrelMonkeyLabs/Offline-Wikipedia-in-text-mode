 "text": "The Colisée Pepsi (English: Pepsi Coliseum), formerly the Colisée de Québec (English: Quebec Coliseum) was a multi-purpose arena in Quebec City, Quebec. The arena opened on December 8, 1949, and was formerly home to the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). It was also the home of the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association (WHA) and National Hockey League (NHL) from 1972 until 1995 when they relocated to Denver, Colorado to become the Avalanche. The 1971 Memorial Cup championship series was hosted at the arena and saw the Remparts defeat the Edmonton Oil Kings two games to none. The first game of the 1974 Summit Series between the Canadian WHA all-stars and the Soviet national team was held at the Coliseum, as well as one game in each of the 1976 and 1991 Canada Cups. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Indoor arenas Category:Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Category:Sports buildings in Canada Category:Sport in Quebec City Category:1949 establishments in Canada",
