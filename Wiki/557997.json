 "text": "Scammel was one of the original ten cutters built and used by the United States Revenue Cutter Service. The Schammel was named by Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, after the American Revolutionary War Adjutant general of the army, Alexander Scammell. General Scammell was captured by the British at the Battle of Yorktown and shot. As with the USRC General Green (1791), the name is misspelled. The Scammel was built at Portsmouth, New Hampshire and launched in 1791. She was used to patrol New England waters. == History == The Scammel was built at Portsmouth but problems delayed her construction. She was not launched until a month after the USRC General Green (1791), on August 24, 1791. She was to be stationed at Portsmouth and her patrol area was from Nantucket, Massachusetts to the Passamaquoddy Bay in Maine. Her first master was Hopley Yeaton, the first seagoing officer to be commissioned in the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service. John Parrott was the second mate while John Adams was third mate. Originally Hamilton had some difficulty in finding a first mate when the Scammel went into service. In November 1792, John Adams was promoted to first mate and Benjamin Gunnerson became the new second mate.Alexander Hamilton, The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, ed. Harold C.
