 "text": "George Whitefield (27 December 1714 – 30 September 1770), was a preacher on the Church of England. He was one of the leaders of the Methodist movement. Colonists loved to hear him preach of love and forgiveness as he had a different style of preaching compared to Old World priests. This led to new missionary work in the Americas in converting Indians to Christianity. He helped establish the Evangelical movement, which was based on the idea that salvation could be achieved through believing in Jesus and following God’s word in the Bible.
