 "text": "Point Judith is a small village and cape (the geographical place) on the western side of Narragansett Bay. Point Judith is set in Washington County, Rhode Island. It is also on the coast of Rhode Island at Narragansett. ==Tropical storms/hurricanes== On September 21, 1938, a severe and very powerful major hurricane (probably Category Three or Four) affected Point Judith. Just under six years later, another powerful hurricane affected the area. The 1944 hurricane was almost Category Three when it struck New England. Hurricane Carol in late August 1954 struck across the Connecticut–Rhode Island state line as a mild Category Three hurricane. The storm caused next to $200 million in damage as it hit. On August 19, 1991 Hurricane Bob came onto Rhode Island next to Newport and Jamestown. In the 21st century, several very serious tropical storms headed through Rhode Island or very close to. On September 6–8, 2008 Tropical Storm Hanna moved just north of Point Judith. Thirteen years later, Tropical Storms Elsa and Henri ran across Rhode Island. These two were almost hurricanes in July (Elsa) and August (Henri) of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. ==References== Category:Villages in Rhode Island Category:18th-century establishments in the United States",
