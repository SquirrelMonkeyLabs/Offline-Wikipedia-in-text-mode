 "text": "On 5 June 2022, a mass shooting and bomb attack happened at a Catholic church in the city of Owo, Ondo State, Nigeria. The attack took place at the St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. The attackers exploded bombs right outside the building and started firing their guns. Four of the perpetrators fired directly into the building. People tried to escape the building, but the main entrance was locked and the gunmen were firing at people trying to run through the remaining two. When people who were shot tried to get up the attackers would shoot them again. A witness said that he saw five gunmen who perpetrated the attack. Two security forces officers were also killed. At least 22 deaths have been confirmed so far, but it is likely that over fifty people were killed in the attack. A group hasn't yet said that they were responsible, so the perpetrator of the attack is unknown. ==References== Category:2022 crimes in Africa Category:2022 disasters in Africa Category:2022 mass shootings Category:2020s building bombings Category:2020s crimes in Nigeria Category:2020s explosions in Africa Category:2020s mass shootings in Africa Category:2020s murders in Africa Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2022 Category:Attacks on churches Category:Building bombings in Africa Category:Explosions in 2022 Category:June 2022 events Category:Mass murder in 2022 Category:Massacres in Africa Category:Ondo State Category:Religious building shootings Category:Terrorist incidents in 2022 Category:Terrorist incidents in Africa in the 2020s Category:2022 in Nigeria Category:Mass shootings in Nigeria",
