 "text": "A gooseberry is a type of fruit, specifically a berry, and they belong to the same family as the currant. They have a greenish colour, although they darken to a purplish-red as they ripen. Gooseberries look similar to ungrown clementines, and the skin is covered in little hairs. Gooseberries are sometimes informally called goosegogs in the British Isles, although this term is not as common in the present day. Often, gooseberries are made into jams and preserves, but can be consumed in a variety of ways such as in baked goods or eaten straight off the bush. They have a taste and texture that is similar to grapes, albeit more acidic; they are sour when they are green and become sweeter as they turn red/purple. Category:Berries Category:Ribes",
