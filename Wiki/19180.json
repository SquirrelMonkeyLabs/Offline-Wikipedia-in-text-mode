 "text": "The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is a nation in west central Africa, and one of the smallest countries in Africa. It borders Cameroon on the north, Gabon on the south and east, and the Gulf of Guinea on the west. The country's territory is both on the continent and on islands. The continental part is known as Río Muni. On one island, Bioko, is the capital, Malabo. Equatorial Guinea and the peoples living there were colonized by Spain. Spanish is an official language because of this. == Provinces == Equatorial Guinea is divided into eight provinces (capitals appear in parentheses): # Annobón (San Antonio de Palé) # Bioko Norte (Malabo) # Bioko Sur (Luba) # Centro Sur (Evinayong) # Djibloho (Ciudad de la Paz) # Kié-Ntem (Ebebiyín) # Litoral (Bata) # Wele-Nzas (Mongomo) The provinces are further divided into districts. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1968 establishments in Africa Category:French-speaking countries Category:Spanish-speaking countries",
