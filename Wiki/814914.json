The main two people in the election were Ben Sasse (Republican Party), Chris Janicek (Democratic Party). Sasse won the election and went back to the Senate for a second term. This election was strange because Democratic nominee Chris Janicek, lost the support of his party after a number of scandals, write-in candidate Preston Love Jr., got the support of the state Democratic Party instead but Janicek was still on the ballot.
