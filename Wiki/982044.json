 "text": "Golmayo is a municipality found in the province of Soria in the autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain. Currently, Golmayo ranks as the ninth most populous municipality in the province. The date was the 19th of 1996. With 932 new residents, or 209% of the total population, Golmayo had the province's greatest growth rate between 1998 and 2008 because to its close proximity to Soria, the provincial capital, which is now a suburb. This is in contrast to the province of Soria as a whole, which has experienced a declining population trend over the past few decades: 165 of the province's 193 municipalities have actually seen population declines since the mid-1990s, leaving the province as a whole with a 1.9% population increase in the twelve years leading up to 2008.
