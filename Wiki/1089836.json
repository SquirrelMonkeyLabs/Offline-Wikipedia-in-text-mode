 "text": "The Penan flying frog (Leptomantis penanorum) is a frog. It lives in Gunung Mulu National Park in Malaysia. People have seen it 1650 meters above sea level. The skin of the frog's back is yellow-green in color. The iris of the eye is red in color with some gray. People have only seen this frog in one stream high in the beginning of Sungei Tapin. Scientists think this is the only place where this frog lives. The tadpoles swim in small pools where the water only moves a little. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because, even though it only lives in a small place, that place is a protected park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
