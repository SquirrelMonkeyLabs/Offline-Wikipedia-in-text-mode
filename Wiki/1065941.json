 "text": "Magadha was a kingdom located in southern northeastern India and Nepal. It went through different dynasties such as the Brihadratha, Haryanka, Shaishunaga, Nanda, Mauryan, Shunga, and Kanva dynasties. Over time, Magadha lost some of its lands to the Satavahanas in 28 BC and became a smaller principality. During the time of the Mauryas, Magadha became a large empire, covering a big part of north India and Nepal. Magadha was central to the Nanda Empire, Maurya Empire, Shunga Empire, and Gupta Empire. The Pala Empire also ruled over Magadha and had a royal camp in Pataliputra. Even after the major empires, the Pithipatis of Bodh Gaya continued to call themselves Magadhādipati and ruled parts of Magadha until the 13th century. == Area of Magadha == Before Magadha expanded, its kingdom was limited by the Ganges, Son, and Campā rivers to the north, west, and east, while the southern border was formed by the eastern spurs of the Vindhya mountains. This initial Magadha kingdom covered what is now Patna and Gaya districts in the Indian state of Bihar.Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1953). Political History of Ancient India: From the Accession of Parikshit to the Extinction of Gupta Dynasty. University of Calcutta. pp. 110–118. Greater Magadha, which was part of the eastern Gangetic plains, included nearby areas and parts of Nepal, and had its own unique culture and beliefs. == History == The Magadha people are mentioned in ancient texts like the Atharvaveda along with other groups. The main part of their kingdom was in Bihar, south of the Ganges River. Their first capital was Rajagriha, later known as Rajgir, and then Pataliputra, which is modern Patna. Magadha grew by conquering Vajjika League and Anga, covering most of Bihar and parts of Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal. The kingdom is talked about in Jain and Buddhist texts, as well as in the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and the Puranas. The early rulers are not well-known, but the Haryanka dynasty led for about 200 years from 543 to 413 BCE. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, lived in Magadha, gaining enlightenment in Bodh Gaya and giving his first sermon in Sarnath. The Haryanka dynasty was followed by the Shishunaga dynasty, and later, Mahapadma Nanda ended their rule in 345 BCE. Chandragupta Maurya defeated the Nandas around 321 BCE, starting the Mauryan Empire. Under King Ashoka, it expanded across India. After the Mauryan Empire, the Shunga and Khārabēḷa empires followed, replaced by the Gupta Empire. The Gupta capital remained in Pataliputra in Magadha.Tenzin Tharpa, Tibetan Buddhist Essentials: A Study Guide for the 21st Century: Volume 1: Introduction, Origin, and Adaptation, p.31 == List of rulers == Following is the Chronology of rulers according to the Buddhist Mahavamsa: ;Haryanka dynasty ( – 413 BCE) List of Haryanka dynasty rulers Ruler Reign (BCE) Bimbisara 544–491 BCE Ajatashatru 491–461 BCE Udayin 461–428 BCE Anirudha 428–419 BCE Munda 419–417 BCE Darshaka 417–415 BCE Nāgadāsaka 415–413 BCE ;Shishunaga dynasty ( – 345 BCE) List of Shishunga dynasty rulers Ruler Reign (BCE) Shishunaga 413–395 BCE Kalashoka 395–377 BCE Kshemadharman 377–365 BCE Kshatraujas 365–355 BCE Nandivardhana 355–349 BCE Mahanandin 349–345 BCE ;Nanda Empire () List of Nanda dynasty rulers Ruler Reign (BCE) Mahapadma Nanda 345–340 BCE Pandhukananda 340–339 BCE Panghupatinanda 339–338 BCE Bhutapalananda 338–337 BCE Rashtrapalananada 337–336 BCE Govishanakananda 336–335 BCE Dashasidkhakananda 335–334 BCE Kaivartananda 334–333 BCE Karvinathanand 333–330 BCE Dhana Nanda 330–322 BCE == References == Category:History of India Category:History of Nepal Category:Establishments in Asia Category:Disestablishments in Asia Category:Former empires Category:Former countries in South Asia",
