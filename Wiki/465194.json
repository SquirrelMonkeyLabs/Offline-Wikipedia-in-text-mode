 "text": "The Casas Colgadas (Hanging Houses), also known as Casas Voladas, Casas del Rey is a complex of houses located in Cuenca, Spain. Houses of this kind were frequent along the eastern border of the ancient city in the past. They hang on the cliffs over the Huécar River gorge.Kelly Lipscomb, Spain: Adventure Guide (Garsington: Windsor, 2005), p. 220 Today there are only a few of the houses still there. The most well known is a group of three with wooden balconies. The houses date to the 14th century.Patricia Harris; David Lyon, Frommer's Spain (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2012), p. 186 Through the years they have been refurbished a few times. The most recent took place during the 1920s. They have been used as individual homes. They have also been used as council houses. Now they are the host to a mesón, a type of restaurant, and the Museo de Arte Abstracto Español (Spanish Abstract Art Museum), in Cuenca. The Casas Colgadas were one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007. ==Gallery== File:Puente de San Pablo 3.JPG| File:Cuenca CasasColgadas1.jpg| File:Cuenca - casas colgantes.JPG| File:Casas colgadas de Cuenca II.jpg| File:Casas Colgadas, Cuenca, España.jpg| File:Casas Colgadas de Cuenca sobre el Puente de San Pablo.JPG| File:Casas Colgadas - Cuenca (Explorer) (3080665244).jpg| File:007244 - Cuenca.JPG| ==References== ==Other websites== * Cuenca Spain: A Visit to the Hanging Houses * The Hanging Houses of Cuenca Category:Buildings and structures in Spain Category:12 Treasures of Spain - Finalists Category:14th-century buildings and structures",
