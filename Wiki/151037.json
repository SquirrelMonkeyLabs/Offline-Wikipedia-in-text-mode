 "text": "New Netherland (Dutch: Nieuw-Nederland, Latin: Nova Belgica or Novum Belgium) was a colony of the Dutch Empire from 1614 to 1664 and from 1673 to 1674. It was a base for the fur trade, and its capital was New Amsterdam, now New York City. The other important trading post in New Netherland was Fort Orange, now Albany. Most settlers lived in those towns or between them, along the Hudson River, but some lived in distant parts of the colony. New Netherland was between colonies that England wanted to connect together. During the Anglo- Dutch Wars England sent warships to conquer New Netherland. The Dutch colonists surrendered because they were afraid that the English Royal Navy would destroy their town. The Dutch traded the colony to England for Surinam, in South America, and Run, in the East Indies, which they thought were worth more. The English divided their new colony to make the English colonies of New York and New Jersey. They also gave parts of it to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. == References == Category:1614 establishments Category:17th century in the Thirteen Colonies Category:History of New York City Category:1660s disestablishments Category:Disestablishments in North America Category:1673 establishments Category:1670s establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:17th-century establishments in New York Category:1670s disestablishments Category:Dutch Empire Category:Former colonies in North America",
