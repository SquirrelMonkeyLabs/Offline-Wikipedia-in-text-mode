 "text": "Giuseppe Mazzini (22 June 1805 â€“ 10 March 1872) was an Italian patriot, philosopher, Freemason, and politician. His efforts helped bring about Italian unification to replace the several separate states, many of which were dominated by foreign powers, that existed until the 19th century. He also helped define the modern European movement for democracy in a republican state. == Criticisms == Karl Marx, on an interview by R. Landor in 1871, said that Mazzini's ideas represents \"nothing better than the old idea of a middle- class republic\". Marx believed, especially after the Revolutions of 1848, that the middle-class point of view had become reactionary and that the proletariat had nothing to do with it. == References == ==Other websites== * Biography at cronologia.it Category:1805 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Freemasons Category:Italian esotericists Category:Politicians from Genoa Category:Italian writers",
