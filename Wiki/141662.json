In animals, it is made from cholesterol. It is the base for certain estrogens and androgens. In animals, it is produced by their body mainly during the second half of the menstrual cycle. During pregnancy it is produced in higher quantities. Willard Myron Allen co-discovered progesterone with George Washington Corner at the University of Rochester Medical School in 1933. Allen discovered the temperature needed to melt it and its weight. He also gave it the name \"Progesterone\" based on progestational steroidal ketone.http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/lwwgateway/landingpage.htm;jsessionid=R2dc47m048bxLF2j9vg9nZGkV4LPQ9X4PTkhCqCVdsC7dJrhTPPm!1612949135!181195629!8091!-1?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an;=00007611-197010000-00012 In one plant, Juglans regia, progesterone has been found.
