He favored the two-party system. He said to Mark Twain in San Francisco that he was a Republican so his little boy, William Randolph Hearst, would become a Democrat. In 1886 he became a state senator in California. Later, his son bought more and more newspapers, which were often accused of being sensational.pp. 576, 315 – 316, Twain, Smith, & others (2010) Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume I.
