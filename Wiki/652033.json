 "text": "D12 (also known as The Dirty Dozen) was an American hip hop collective. They were formed in 1996 in Detroit, Michigan. ==History== The band gained significant notoriety thanks to Eminem's international success. Taking advantage of this success, they have managed to rank their albums at the top of sales in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Their best known singles were \"Fight Music\", \"Purple Pills\", \"My Band\", \"Shit on You\", and \"How Come\". Since 2006 after the death of Proof, the group has remained almost inactive because of Eminem's drug problems. It led to its withdrawal from the music scene for more than three years and the departure of Mr. Porter and Bizarre in 2012. However, the group reformed several times in 2014, only for Eminem to announce their breakup on \"Stepping Stone\" from Kamikaze. However, as Kuniva and Swifty had been recording and touring under the name D12 as a trio for several years prior to Eminem's announcement and have continued to do so since, this announcement is more accurately read as Eminem's official retirement from the group after a decade of token involvement. ==Members== ;Former members *Eminem (1999–2006) *Proof (1996–2006; his death) *Bizarre (1996–2006, 2008–2012, 2014–2018) *Mr. Porter (1996–2006, 2008–2012, 2014–2018) *Kuniva (1996–2006, 2008–2018) *Swifty McVay (1999–2006, 2008–2018) *Bugz (1996–1999; his death) *Fuzz Scoota (2011–2014) ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:5 right:10 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1996 till:08/31/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:lines value:black legend:Studio_album id:bars value:gray(0.95) BackgroundColors = bars:bars Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1996 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1996 LineData = at:06/19/2001 color:black layer:back at:04/27/2004 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Eminem text:\"Eminem\" bar:Proof text:\"Proof\" bar:Bizarre text:\"Bizarre\" bar:Porter text:\"Mr. Porter\" bar:Kuniva text:\"Kuniva\" bar:Swifty text:\"Swifty McVay\" bar:Bugz text:\"Bugz\" bar:Fuzz text:\"Fuzz Scoota\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) color:Vocals bar:Eminem from:05/21/1999 till:04/11/2006 bar:Proof from:01/01/1996 till:04/11/2006 bar:Bizarre from:01/01/1996 till:04/11/2006 bar:Bizarre from:05/21/2008 till:02/28/2012 bar:Bizarre from:02/07/2014 till:08/31/2018 bar:Porter from:01/01/1996 till:04/11/2006 bar:Porter from:05/21/2008 till:03/24/2012 bar:Porter from:11/24/2014 till:08/31/2018 bar:Kuniva from:01/01/1996 till:04/11/2006 bar:Kuniva from:05/21/2008 till:08/31/2018 bar:Swifty from:05/21/1999 till:04/11/2006 bar:Swifty from:05/21/2008 till:08/31/2018 bar:Bugz from:01/01/1996 till:05/21/1999 bar:Fuzz from:04/07/2011 till:10/02/2014 ==Awards and nominations== Year Ceremony Award Result 2002 ECHO Awards Best Hip-Hop/Urban Artist (International) 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards Best Hip-Hop Act Best Group 2004 MTV Video Music Awards Video of the Year Best Group Video Best Rap Video ==Discography== Studio albums * Devil's Night (2001) * D12 World (2004) ==Notes== ==References== Category:1990s establishments in Michigan Category:1995 establishments in the United States Category:2017 disestablishments in the United States Category:Disestablishments in Michigan Category:Musical groups from Detroit Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:American rap music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1996 Category:Musical groups disestablished in the 2010s",
