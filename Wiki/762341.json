It was there that she posted her controversial lunchbox post. === Lunchbox Controversy === In late February 2020, Rachael faced severe backlash after she posted the image of the lunchbox of her schoolgoing daughter, Violet. Critics stated that she did not feed Violet enough, but Rachael proved them wrong, stating, “My number one priority is to ensure that my kids are happy and healthy - so I give them real food, I give them whole pieces of fruit, and I give them vegetables in their lunch box. So Violet will go to school with sushi and a Greek salad, for example...If a mother wants to feed her child cherry tomatoes over cheezels (sic) then she can. It’s not deprivation or a screwed up childhood... it’s because she cares, and perhaps she has learnt from experience.” == Television== Rachael works for the Seven Network as a reporter for several of its programs across current affairs and sports telecasts as well as making contestant appearances on Seven Network's in-house celebrity competition programs. She was one of the contestants in Celebrity MasterChef Australia in 2009. She progressed to the semi-finals, where she and Biggest Loser trainer Michelle Bridges made it through to the next stage.
