 "text": "Sanamahism is the traditional religion of the Meitei people in Manipur, India. It is also called Meiteism or Lainingthouism. Sanamahism is a polytheistic religion, meaning it has many gods. The religion is named after the god Lainingthou Sanamahi, who is one of the most important gods in Meitei beliefs. == History == Sanamahism is believed to be about 3800 years old. The earliest records are found in the Cheitharol Kumbaba, the royal chronicle of Manipur, starting from King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, who ruled from 33 to 154 CE. == Beliefs and Practices == Sanamahism teaches that the universe was created by the god Kuru. Other main gods include: * Lainingthou Sanamahi, protector of humans. * Sidaba Mapu, creator of the universe. * Pakhangba, ruler of the universe and destroyer of evil. * Leimarel Sidabi, goddess of the earth. * Imoinu Ahongbi, goddess of wealth and prosperity. People worship these gods in their homes and in sacred groves called Umang Lai. Festivals like Lai Haraoba celebrate the gods with dances and rituals. == Revival Movement == In 1930, Naoriya Phulo started the Apokpa Marup to revive Sanamahism. The movement grew, and in 1945, the Meitei Marup was formed to promote the religion and the Meitei script. In 1992, the King of Manipur declared Sanamahism as the state religion again. == Official Recognition == On 5 August 2022, the Manipur Legislative Assembly passed a resolution to recognize Sanamahism as a minority religion in India and to give it a separate code in the census. == Number of Followers == According to the 2011 Census of India, 222,422 people follow Sanamahism, mostly in Manipur. == References == * Category:Indian religions",
