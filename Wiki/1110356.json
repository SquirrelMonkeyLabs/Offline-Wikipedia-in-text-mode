 "text": "Corinna, or Korinna (; c. 500–401 BCE), was an ancient Greek poet from Tanagra in Boeotia. She may have been a contemporary and rival of the Greek poet Pindar. Corinna's poetry survives only in pieces and focuses on local Boeotian myths. ==Biography== Corinna was from Tanagra in Boeotia (central Greece). The Suda, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, says she was the daughter of Acheloodorus and Procratia, and was nicknamed \"Myia\" (Μυῖα, \"the fly\").Suda κ 2087, \"Corinna\" She was said to have lived during the fifth century BC. She was maybe a contemporary of Pindar, either having taught him, or having been a fellow student of Myrtis of Anthedon with him. Corinna was said to have defeated Pindar in either one poetry competition or five poetry competitions. ==Poetry== Corinna wrote five books of poetry according to the Suda. But her poetry survives in roughly forty pieces. Corinna uses simple and clear language in her poetry. She uses basic metrical schemes, and focuses on mythical stories. The tone of Corinna's poetry is ironic or humorous. Corinna was respected by the people of her hometown, Tanagra. Pausanias says that there was a monument to her in the streets of the town and a painting of her in the gymnasium. Tatian writes in his Address to the Greeks that Silanion had sculpted her. Corinna's poetry was popular in the Roman Empire. She is mentioned by the first-century BC Greek poet Antipater of Thessalonica who lists her as one of nine \"mortal muses\". Ovid gives his lover the pseudonym \"Corinna\" in his Amores. She is also named by Propertius as a model for Cynthia, and by Statius along with Callimachus, Lycophron, and Sophron. Alexander Polyhistor wrote comments about her work. ==Gallery== File:Stückelberg Myrthis und Corinna beim Töpfer Agathon 1897.jpg|Corinna was a student of Myrtis of Anthedon, according to ancient tradition, with whom she sits in this 1897 painting by Ernst Stückelberg.
