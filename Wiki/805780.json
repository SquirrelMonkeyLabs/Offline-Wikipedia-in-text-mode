It began in 1978 as an alliance to support President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing against Gaullist power over the political right in France. This name was chosen due to the title of Giscard d'Estaing's 1976 book, Démocratie française. The party brought together Christian democrats, liberals and radicals. ==References== Category:1970s establishments in France Category:1978 establishments in Europe Category:2000s disestablishments in France Category:2007 disestablishments in Europe Category:Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Category:Political parties in France",
