 "text": "Hypospermia is a condition where the testicles of a man make an abnormally low volume of semen during ejaculation. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the condition of hypospermia when less than 1.50 mL of semen is produced in a single ejaculation. Hypospermia itself does not cause severe infertility issues. However, a combination of hypospermia with oligoozoospermia (low sperm count in semen) negatively affects the chance to conceive naturally. Category:Sexual disorders",
