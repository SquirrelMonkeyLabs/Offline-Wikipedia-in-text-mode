 "text": "Berthe Marie Pauline Morisot (; January 14, 1841 – March 2, 1895) was an Impressionist painter. She was born in Bourges, France, and died in Paris. In the 1860s, she studied with Camille Corot. She exhibited at the 1865 Salon. Morisot met artist Édouard Manet in 1868. Manet painted her portrait several times. The two had great influence on one another's work. In 1874, she married his brother, Eugène. She exhibited at the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. Morisot worked in oils, pastels, and watercolor. Her pictures are light and delicate. They typically depict women and children in everyday domestic life. Many critics ridiculed the Impressionists. Morisot was not spared. She was never commercially successful during her lifetime. During her lifetime however, she outsold prominent Impressionists Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley. == Gallery == File:Berthe Morisot, Le berceau (The Cradle), 1872.jpg|The Cradle, 1872 File:Child among the Hollyhocks - Berthe Morisot - Paris 1863 – 1874- Revolution in der Kunst-9810 (without frame).jpg|Child among the staked roses, 1881 File:Berthe Morisot The Bath.jpg|The Bath, 1885 or 1886 == References == Category:French painters Category:Impressionist painters Category:People from Bourges Category:1841 births Category:1895 deaths",
