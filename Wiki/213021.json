 "text": "Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) is one of the largest militant groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and stands for the integration of the Disputed Territory and supports the unification of all the Kashmir region with Pakistan. Since its formation the Hizbul Mujahideen organization has also wanted the complete Islamization of Kashmir. The Hizbul Mujahideen was formed in 1989 in the Kashmir Valley with Master Ahsan Dar as its chief. Dar was later arrested by the Indian Army by mid-December 1993. It was reportedly formed as the militant wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) at the behest of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistanâ€™s external intelligence agency, to counter the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which had advocated complete independence of the State from the nations. Many of the early Hizbul Mujahideen cadres were former JKLF members. Category:Kashmir",
