Blunt was the \"fourth man\" of the Cambridge Five, a group of Cambridge- educated spies working for the Soviet Union from some time in the 1930s to at least the early 1950s. The height of his spying was during World War II, when he passed intelligence to the Soviet Union. His confession was a closely guarded secret for years. It was revealed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in November 1979. He was stripped of his knighthood immediately. Blunt was professor of art history at the University of London, director of the Courtauld Institute of Art, and Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Academics of the University of Cambridge Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:English historians Category:British intelligence people Category:British military personnel of World War II Category:English LGBT people Category:Gay men Category:LGBT academics Category:People from Bournemouth Category:British spies for the Soviet Union Category:Writers from Hampshire",
