 "text": "Neoconservatism in Japan refers to the new generation of Japanese conservatives. They are nationalistic and think Japan is unique and special. They think they are not responsible for Japan's conquests and wartime history, Japanese war crimes, the Nanjing Massacre, and the Japanese colonization of Korea. They want to change the Japanese constitution and remove Article 9. After losing WW2, Japan wrote into its constitution that it is not allowed to wage war. This is Article 9. The USA helped write it because he wanted to prevent Japan from ever attacking the US or any other country like when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. However Japanese neoconservatives want to restore the military in that they want to use the Japanese \"Self-Defense\" Forces to for more than just \"self-defense\". But this is against Article 9. Some like Shinz≈ç Abe have visited the Yasukuni Shrine to honor Japanese soldiers who murdered and raped Koreans, Chinese, and other Asians. They do not like China and refuse to apologize for Imperial Japan's war crimes. They do not like Korea either, North or South. They do not think their relationship with Korea is special. Some like Shintaro Ishihara want fewer immigrants. Some want to ban foreigners from voting, and only \"Japanese nationals\" should have the right. ==References== Category:Politics of Japan",
