The brothers currently wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where they are the TNA World Tag Team Champions in their third reign. The Hardy Boyz are best known for competing in the World Wrestling Federation/WWE. They were known for competing in ladder and TLC matches. They also worked for All Elite Wrestling (AEW). The team first started in independent promotions around North Carolina in 1993. The team signed with the WWF (later WWE) in 1998. They joined Gangrel to form The New Brood in August 1999. During their time in the WWF, they were managed by Terri for a short time before they were managed full-time by their real- life friend Lita. When Lita joined, the team was known as \"Team Xtreme\". They split up in 2002 and reunited in 2006 to feud with MNM before they decided to focus on singles competition. Jeff left the company in August 2009 and Matt left in late 2010. They both reunited in January 2011 in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where they were members of the Immortal stable. Matt was released from the company in August 2011 after he was arrested for driving while intoxicated. They reunited in 2014 and became two-time TNA World Tag Team Champions. In 2017, they returned to WWE at WrestleMania 33, and stayed there until 2021. They started teaming in AEW the following year, and returned to Impact in 2024, winning their third World Tag Team Championship. == Championships and accomplishments == * All Star Wrestling (West Virginia) ** ASW Tag Team Championship (1 time) * The Crash ** The Crash Tag Team Championship (1 time) * House of Glory ** HOG Tag Team Championship (1 time) * International Wrestling Cartel ** IWC Tag Team Championship (1 time) * MCW Pro Wrestling ** MCW Tag Team Championship (1 time) *New Dimension Wrestling **NDW Tag Team Championship (1 time) *NWA 2000 **NWA 2000 Tag Team Championship (1 time) *Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts **OMEGA Tag Team Championship (2 times) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI Match of the Year (2000) (vs. The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian in a Triangle Ladder match at WrestleMania 2000) **PWI Match of the Year (2001) (vs. The Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian in a TLC match at WrestleMania X-Seven) **PWI Tag Team of the Year (2000) **PWI Comeback of the Year (2017) *Ring of Honor ** ROH World Tag Team Championship (1 time) ** Holy S*** Moment of the Decade (2010s) (Hardys Show Up, Win ROH World Tag Team Gold) *Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ** TNA World Heavyweight Championship (5 times) – Jeff (3) and Matt (2) ** TNA World Tag Team Championship (3 times, current) ** TNA World Tag Team Championship #1 Contender Tournament (2014) ** TNA World Tag Team Championship Tournament (2015) ** Race for the Case (2017 – Green Case) – Jeff *World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment **WCW Tag Team Championship (1 time) **WWF/E World Tag Team Championship (six times) **WWE Raw Tag Team Championship (1 time) **WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship (1 time) **WWE Championship (1 time) – Jeff **World Heavyweight Championship (2 times) – Jeff **ECW Championship (1 time) – Matt **WWF/E European Championship (2 times) – (Jeff (1) and Matt (1)) **WWF/E Hardcore Championship (4 times) – (Jeff (3) and Matt (1)) **WWF/E Intercontinental Championship – (2 times) (Jeff) **WWF Light Heavyweight Championship – (1 time) (Jeff) *Wrestling Superstar ** Wrestling Superstar Tag Team Championship (1 time) ==References== == Other websites == *The Hardy Show *Jeff Hardy's WWE profile *Matt Hardy's WWE profile *Jeff Hardy's TNA profile Category:All Elite Wrestling teams and stables Category:Ring of Honor teams and stables Category:WWE teams and stables",
