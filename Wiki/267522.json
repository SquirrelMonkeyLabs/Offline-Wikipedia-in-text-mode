As a toddler, Estefan fled Cuba with her family when Communist dictator Fidel Castro rose to power. Her father, Jose Manuel Fajardo, had been a Cuban soldier and bodyguard of former President Fulgencio Batista. Her maternal grandfather, Leonardo García, immigrated to Cuba from Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain. He married Gloria's maternal grandmother in Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain. Her maternal grandmother is originally from Logroño, Spain. After coming to the United States, Fajardo was recruited into the 2506 Brigade, a Central Intelligence Agency-funded band of Cuban refugees that was involved in the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. After President John F. Kennedy negotiated the release of the captured soldiers, Fajardo rejoined his family. He eventually joined the U.S. Army and served for two years in Vietnam. As a child Estefan liked to write poetry, and though she took classical guitar lessons, she found them tedious. She had no idea that she would some day become a popular music star, but music played a very important role for her as a teenager. After her father's return from Vietnam, he was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, possibly as a result of having been exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange while serving in the army. Estefan's mother, who had been a teacher in Cuba, worked to support the family during the day and attended school at night. Young Gloria was left to take care of her father and younger sister. She had little social life, and because she felt the weight of such responsibilities she turned to music as a release. \"When my father was ill, music was my escape,\" Estefan told Washington Post reporter Richard Harrington. \"I would lock myself up in my room for hours and just sing. I wouldn't cry—I refused to cry...Music was the only way I had to just let go, so I sang for fun and for emotional catharsis.\" Estefan said in an interview, that she is not affiliated with any political party. ==Discography== ===Albums discography=== Studio albums Release date Title 1984 Eyes of Innocence 1985 Primitive Love 1987 Let It Loose / Anything for You 1989 Cuts Both Ways 1991 Into The Light 1993 Mi Tierra 1994 Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me 1995 Abriendo Puertas 1996 Destiny 1998 gloria! 2000 Alma Caribeña 2003 Unwrapped 2007 90 Millas 2011 Miss Little Havana ==Filmography== Film Film Film Film Year Film Role Notes 1999 Music of the Heart Isabel Vazquez Debut acting performance 2000 Little Angelita Voice Narrator Animated Short Film For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story Emilia Television film 2003 Famous: The Making of Unwrapped Herself Album documentary 2007 90 Millas Documentary Herself Album documentary 2008 Marley & Me Herself Cameo appearance 2009 G-Force Juárez Voice in the Latin-American version of the filmG-Force review. \"GLORIA ESTEFAN MÉXICO\" Gloria Estefan Mexico web site (in Spanish) 2010 Recording: The History Of Recorded Music Herself Documentary Television Television Television Television Year Title Role Notes 1986 Club Med - One episode 1989 Postcard From Miami with Clive James Herself One episode 1993 The Hypnotic World of Paul McKenna Herself 2000 Frasier Maria One episode: \"Something About Dr. Mary\" 2005 A Capitol Fourth Herself 2009 Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List Herself One episode: \"Rosie and Gloria and Griffin...
