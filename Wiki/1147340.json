The TSE is a founding member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges and was one of the best-performing stock markets globally between 2002 and 2013. It is considered an \"emerging\" or \"frontier\" market. Iran’s stock market includes companies from many industries, such as car manufacturing, telecommunications, farming, petrochemicals, mining, steel, copper, banking, and insurance. Many of these companies were originally state- owned but have since been privatized. In the first minutes of today's trading, the main stock index went up by more than 16,000 points, breaking its all-time high and reaching 2,559,000 points. (Saturday, December 14, 2024) == History == The idea of a stock exchange in Iran began in 1936 but was delayed by World War II. It was finally implemented in 1967 with the Stock Exchange Act, starting as a small market for corporate and government bonds. In the 1970s, Iran’s economic growth and public interest in investing led to increased activity. The government encouraged participation by giving shares to employees of large companies, boosting the Tehran Stock Exchange. ==References== == Other websites == * * **TSE Indexes **TSE Annual Report 2010 *Sukuk (Islamic Financial Instruments) *Tehran Securities Exchange Technology Management Company (TSETMC) *Securities and Exchange Brokers Association - Self-regulatory organization of TSE *Financial Tribune - (Iranian English newspaper) Offers daily reports on the TSE *Iran Securities and Exchange Organization (SEO) – Offers Quarterly Bulletin of Iran Islamic Capital Market *Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges – TSE statistics/regulations/operations/international comparisons/calendar and latest news *Iran's Capital Markets – Comprehensive 2003-Study *Turquoise Partners – Monthly report on the Tehran Stock Exchange and Iran's economy *Iran CSD Company – Clearing and settlement of trading, central registry Category:1967 establishments in Asia Category:1960s establishments in Iran Category:Stock exchanges in Asia Category:Companies of Iran Category:Tehran",
