 "text": "Dunkin' Donuts, often abbreviated as DD and officially known as simply Dunkin', is an American multinational franchise based in Canton, Massachusetts. The company started as a traditional donut shop, selling doughnuts and coffee. Later, they added flavored coffee and iced coffee. They also began to sell breakfast sandwiches: these contain egg, cheese, and pork (bacon, ham, or sausage), on bread (bagel, croissant, or English muffin). With the addition of breakfast sandwiches, Dunkin' Donuts has since become a popular spot for a quick breakfast. The franchise was established around 1950, in Quincy, Massachusetts. As of 2010, over ten thousand Dunkin' Donuts locations exist worldwide. Their largest market outside of the United States is in South Korea. Its name was officially changed to simply Dunkin' in 2019. ==Sources== Notes ==Other websites== * Category:1950s establishments in Michigan Category:American food companies Category:Companies based in Massachusetts",
