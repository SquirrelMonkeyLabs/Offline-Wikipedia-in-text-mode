She is known for her breakout single, \"Bodak Yellow\", which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in 2017. She became only the second female rapper to reach number one without a featured artist since Lauryn Hill with \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" in 1998. Almanzar also has appeared on the VH1 reality series Love & Hip Hop: New York. Cardi has earned five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100: \"Bodak Yellow\", \"I Like It\", \"Girls like You\" (with Maroon 5), \"WAP\" (with Megan Thee Stallion), and Cardi B \"Up\". On January 2, 2018, Billboard announced that Cardi became only the third artist in history to have their first three singles in the top ten at the same time, with the songs \"Bodak Yellow\", \"MotorSport\", and \"No Limit\". The first two artists to do so were the Beatles and Ashanti. For the week ending July 14, 2018, Cardi's single \"I Like It\" reached the number-one position of the Billboard Hot 100, making her the only female rapper with two chart-toppers on the Hot 100. A remix of \"Girls like You\" by the band Maroon 5, featuring Cardi, also reached number one on the Hot 100. Her first album, Invasion of Privacy, was released on April 6, 2018. Cardi B says that her music is a representation of what she would like to listen to. She is known as the first female artist to be the winner on Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. She released the single \"Press\" on May 31, 2019. On August 7, 2020, she released \"WAP\" featuring rapper Megan Thee Stallion. It entered at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Cardi's fourth chart-topper in the US.
