Chu, written by Ryan Landels, and starring Aubrey Peeples (as the title character), Stefanie Scott, Hayley Kiyoko, Aurora Perrineau, Ryan Guzman, Molly Ringwald, and Juliette Lewis. Borrowing elements from the 1980s animated television series Jem by Christy Marx, the film was produced by Hasbro Studios and Blumhouse Productions. Chu's interest in developing a film adaptation of Jem is based on having grown up watching the original animated series with his sisters. He had attempted to make the film 11 years earlier, but was rejected by Universal due to the cost. ==Reception== Jem and the Holograms was theatrically released in the United States on October 23, 2015, by Universal Pictures, and in the Philippines on November 4, 2015, by Columbia Pictures and was a box office bomb, grossing $2 million worldwide on a $5 million budget and receiving negative reviews from critics and audiences alike. ==References== Category:2010s English-language movies Category:2010s comedy-drama movies Category:2010s fantasy movies Category:2010s romantic comedy movies Category:2010s teen drama movies Category:2015 drama movies Category:American adventure movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:American musical comedy movies Category:American musical fantasy movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:American science fiction movies Category:American teen drama movies Category:Movies about orphans Category:Movies based on TV series Category:Movies directed by Jon M.
