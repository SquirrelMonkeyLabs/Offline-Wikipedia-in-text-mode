 "text": "Jaguar Racing was a Formula One team which raced from 2000 to 2004. It comes from Stewart Grand Prix. Ford bought the team in June 1999 and was to be renamed to Jaguar Racing to promote their Jaguar brand. For their first season in 2000, the team hired former Stewart GP driver Johnny Herbert and the 1999 Championship runner-up (second place) Eddie Irvine. However, the team only finished in the points twice during the season. In 2001, Herbert was replaced by Luciano Burti, who was replaced four races in the season by Pedro de la Rosa. Although the team got double the amount of points finishes in 2001, including a podium (top three) in Monaco, this did not help the fact that the team did not have the same success as Stewart GP got in 1999. In 2002 the team got worse, with three points finishes (but a podium in Italy), and a lot of financial (money) issues. Cutbacks were announced for the 2003 season, which included money savings, and a layoff (mass sackings of employees). In 2003, with a improved points system which allowed eight drivers to finish in the points, Jaguar Racing benefitted from this as they finished in the points eight times, with drivers Mark Webber, Antônio Pizzonia, and Justin Wilson replacing Pizzonia for the last five races. 2004 was to be the last season for Jaguar, keeping Webber, and hiring Christian Klien for the whole season. Five points finishes would follow, though financial difficulties would result in the team being bought out by Red Bull, then the team was renamed to Red Bull Racing. ==Formula One Results== (key) Year Chassis Engine Tyres Drivers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Points WCC 2000 Jaguar R1 Cosworth 3.0 L V10 AUS BRA SMR GBR ESP EUR MON CAN FRA AUT GER HUN BEL ITA USA JPN MAL 4 9th Eddie Irvine Ret Ret 7 13 11 Ret 4 13 13 PO 10 8 10 Ret 7 8 6 Luciano Burti 11 Johnny Herbert Ret Ret 10 12 13 11 9 Ret Ret 7 Ret Ret 8 Ret 11 7 Ret 2001 Jaguar R2 Cosworth 3.0 L V10 AUS MAL BRA SMR ESP AUT MON CAN EUR FRA GBR GER HUN BEL ITA USA JPN 9 8th Eddie Irvine 11 Ret Ret Ret Ret 7 3 Ret 7 Ret 9 Ret Ret Ret Ret 5 Ret Luciano Burti 8 10 Ret 11 Pedro de la Rosa Ret Ret Ret 6 8 14 12 Ret 11 Ret 5 12 Ret 2002 Jaguar R3 Cosworth 3.0 L V10 AUS MAL BRA SMR ESP AUT MON CAN EUR GBR FRA GER HUN BEL ITA USA JPN 8 7th Eddie Irvine 4 Ret 7 Ret Ret Ret 9 Ret Ret Ret Ret Ret Ret 6 3 10 9 Pedro de la Rosa 8 10 8 Ret Ret Ret 10 Ret 11 11 9 Ret 13 Ret Ret Ret Ret 2003 Jaguar R4 Cosworth 3.0 L V10 AUS MAL BRA SMR ESP AUT MON CAN EUR FRA GBR GER HUN ITA USA JPN 18 7th Mark Webber Ret Ret 9 Ret 7 7 Ret 7 6 6 14 11 6 7 Ret 11 Antônio Pizzonia 13 Ret Ret 14 Ret 9 Ret 10 10 10 Ret Justin Wilson Ret Ret Ret 8 13 2004 Jaguar R5 Cosworth 3.0 L V10 AUS MAL BHR SMR ESP MON EUR CAN USA FRA GBR GER HUN BEL ITA CHN JPN BRA 10 7th Mark Webber Ret Ret 8 13 12 Ret 7 Ret Ret 9 8 6 10 Ret 9 10 Ret Ret Christian Klien 11 10 14 14 Ret Ret 12 9 Ret 11 14 10 13 6 13 Ret 12 14 Category:Formula One constructors",
