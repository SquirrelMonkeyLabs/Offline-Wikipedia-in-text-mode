 "text": "The MIÉP–Jobbik Third Way Alliance of Parties (Hungarian: MIÉP–Jobbik a Harmadik Út Pártszövetség) was a radical far-right party alliance created for the 2006 elections, which later turned out to be opportunistic. == History == The party alliance was formed under the leadership of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIÉP) and Movement for a Better Hungary (Jobbik), with some members of the Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers, and Civic Party (FKGP) also joining. They chose this form of cooperation because a joint list would have required 10% of regional votes to enter parliament. In the election, they achieved 2.2% of the vote, failing to win any seats. Their slogan was \"Occupation or Third Way.\" After the election, the alliance dissolved. == Program == Their main goals were to double the minimum wage, tighten immigration to Hungary, introduce a fairer tax system, keep Hungarian farmland in Hungarian hands, replace the entire current political elite, establish a Trianon memorial day, eliminate \"Roma crime\" in Hungary, foster Hungarian national pride, review pro-American foreign policy, drastically reduce the number of parliamentarians, and create a fairer electoral system. ==References == Category:Defunct political parties in Hungary Category:2006 disestablishments in Europe Category:2005 establishments in Europe Category:21st-century establishments in Hungary Category:Eurosceptic parties",
