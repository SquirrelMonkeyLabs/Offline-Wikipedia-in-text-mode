 "text": "The Rioi La Miel mushroomtongue salamander or Lozano's salamander (Bolitoglossa lozanoi) is a salamander. It lives in Colombia. ==Body== The adult salamander is large. It is 5.8 cm long from nose to where the tail meets the body. Its tail is longer than its body. Its eyes are big but do not stick out. It has a big, round nose and front of the face. The skin of the salamander's back is light brown in color with some black marks. The skin of the belly is brown with some white and dark brown marks. ==Home== This animal is awake at night and lives in trees. It lives in forests where there is water in the air. It lives near streams. It can live in forests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have seen this animal between 145 and 1200 meters above sea level. ==Young== This salamander hatches out of its egg as a small salamander and never swims as a tadpole or other larva. ==Danger== Scientists say this animal is not in danger of dying out. It is in some danger because human beings change the places where it lives to make places for animals to eat grass and to make farms, even for plants that are against the law. The place where scientists first found the salamander was changed into a place for a dam to make electricity. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Reserva Natural Privada Riomanso, Serrania de los Yariguies Integrated Management Regional District, Ranita Dorada ProAves Reserve, and Parque Nacional Natural Selva Florencia. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
