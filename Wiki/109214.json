 "text": "The New Orleans Saints are a professional American football team in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. The Saints play in the Southern Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). In 1980, the Saints became the first ever NFL team to finish with 1 win and 15 losses. After a history of bad luck, the Saints won Super Bowl XLIV in the 2009 season off an interception from Peyton Manning by cornerback Tracy Porter. That was also meaningful because only about four years earlier the city was badly hurt when Hurricane Katrina came through in 2005. That was later tarnished as in 2012 they and defesnive coodinator Gregg Williams were exposed to have used a bounty stystem, in which players were paid to deliver especially hard/illegal hits to the opponent. Brees denied knowing of the system. The Saints soon recovered and won three straight NFC South division titles. The team name was inspired by a popular Mardi Gras song called \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". The Saints have several famous players including their starting quarterback Drew Brees. They also have running back Alvin Kamara, wide receiver Michael Thomas, defensive end Cameron Jordan, cornerback Marshon Lattimore, and two linebackers in Demario Davis and Kwon Alexander. After drew Brees's 16 years with the Saints, he retired in the 2021 offseason. == References == * Brees denies knowledge of bounty == Other websites == *New Orleans Saints official web site",
