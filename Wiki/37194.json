 "text": "A belt is a piece of clothing worn around a person's waist. They can be used to hold up trousers(pants, men) or skirts(women) or for carrying things in pockets, such as on a utility belt, which police use. Belts are commonly made using cloth or leather. They are worn by men and women, however men wear them more casually and formally. The most common colors are black and brown. Belts have buckles. Belts are thread around belt loops on trousers(usually Jeans and dress pants for men). Belts have holes into which the buckle is put, making them looser and tighter. Cowboys often wear belts and customize/pick their buckles. ==Other websites== Category:Accessories",
