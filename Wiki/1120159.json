The Corps is represented in 125 secondary schools with a total of 146 units â€“ 108 Land units, 20 Air units and 18 Sea units. It is one of the country's oldest youth organisations, formed in 1901. ==History== The NCC has its beginnings to the Raffles Institution Cadet Corps, as well as its rival Saint Joseph's Institution Cadet Corps the first military cadet school organizations built in 1901 and 1906 respectively during these early days as a British colony. Originally attached to British Armed Forces units placed in the island and later on the Malaysian Armed Forces, the current tri-service character of the Corps dates from 1969, when the NCC was made as the country's only military cadet organization when the then separate cadet forces attached to the young SAF were combined into one national organization. On May 30, 2001, the NCC HQ was opened at Amoy Quee Camp in an effort to move Headquarters NCC and its Land District Headquarters from Haig Road, Springleaf and Jalan Teck Whye Camps as part of the Corps Centennial.https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/MINDEF_20010530381.pdf In 2021, the NCC celebrated its 120th anniversary. ==References== Category:Organizations based in Singapore",
