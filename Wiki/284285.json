He currently works for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) where he competes under the ring name Místico. He was the biggest técnico (face) and the biggest box office draw in all of Mexico. Urive also worked for WWE where he competed under the ring names Sin Cara (Spanish for \"Without Face\" or \"Faceless\") and Sin Cara Azul. During his time in WWE, Urive had a hard time getting used to the WWE style of wrestling and would get injured a lot. He was released from his WWE contract on March 27, 2014 (after which, his ring name was given to his storyline rival Hunico). After his release, he continued to use the Sin Cara name in Mexican independent promotions before adopting the ring name Myzteziz after signing with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) in February 2014. In 2015 he returned to CMLL under the name Carístico. He uses the name and mask of Místico again since August 2021.
