 "text": "Matryoshka (Russian: матрёшка) is a traditional Russian doll made of wood and painted with colorful ornaments. This doll is one of the most popular souvenirs in Russia. It is also widely distributed abroad under different names such as “Aunt Olga,” “Babushka” or “Mommy doll.” Although Matryoshka is called a doll it is actually a set of dolls of different sizes placed one in another. The reason for that lies behind the name “Matryoshkг.” The name \"Matryoshka\" came from the traditional Russian name \"Matryona\". This name was associated with motherhood and fertility. The biggest doll symbolizes “mother” with her numerous “doll” family. == References == Category:Dolls Category:Russian culture",
