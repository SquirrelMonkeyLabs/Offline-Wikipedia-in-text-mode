 "text": "Thomas Charles Lasorda (September 22, 1927 â€“ January 7, 2021) was a Major League Baseball player. He had a long career in sports management. In 2009, he marked his sixth decade in one capacity or another with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers organization, the longest discontinuous (he played one season with the Kansas City Athletics) tenure anyone has had with the team, edging Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully by two seasons. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager in 1997. Lasorda came out of retirement to manage the United States team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He led the Americans to the gold medal, beating heavily favored Cuba, which had won the gold medals at the two previous Olympics. With the death of Red Schoendienst on June 6, 2018, Lasorda was the oldest living Hall-of-Famer. In November 2020, Lasorda was hospitalized for having a heart attack and was discharged the next month. On January 7, 2021, Lasorda went to cardiac arrest at his home in Fullerton, California and died a few hours later, aged 93. ==References== ==Other websites== * Lasorda's blog, \"Tommy's World\" at MLBlogs.com Category:1927 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Deaths from cardiac arrest Category:Brooklyn Dodgers players Category:Kansas City Athletics players Category:Sportspeople from Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from California Category:People from Fullerton, California Category:American bloggers",
