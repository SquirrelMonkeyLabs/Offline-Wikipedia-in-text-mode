 "text": "Baba Sahib Singh Bedi’s Holy War against Rai Alyas was a religious and military campaign conducted by Baba Sahib Singh Bedi in 1801 against Rai Alyas, the teenage chief of the Raikot estate in the Cis-Sutlej region (modern-day Punjab, India). Motivated by religious grievances, including cow slaughter and the oppression of Sikhs and Hindus under Rai's administration, the campaign led to the temporary Sikh conquest of Ludhiana, Raikot, and surrounding areas. == Background == By the last decade of the 18th century, the Punjab region was in a state of political instability. Internal and external raids were common. Baba Sahib Singh Bedi (1756–1834), a direct descendant of Guru Nanak Dev, was a prominent religious and political leader based at Una. Reports of cow slaughter, oppressive taxation, and anti-Sikh activities in Rai Alyas's territories prompted local peasants to seek Bedi’s intervention. After failed diplomatic attempts, and a specific incident involving the imprisonment of Gainda Jat of Mansurpur, Bedi declared a religious war against Rai Alyas in April–May 1801. == Course of the Conflict == ===Battle at Jodh Mansur=== Baba Sahib Singh Bedi, supported by allies like Jodh Singh Shahbadia and Budh Singh Faizalpuria, mobilized a force of about 7,000 troops and crossed the Sutlej River. Early skirmishes led to the capture of Daulon village. Roshan Khan, a key commander of Rai Alyas, was killed during a battle at Jodh Mansur. ===Siege of Ludhiana=== Subsequently, Bedi's forces captured several forts and occupied Ludhiana. Despite attempts by Rai Alyas’s mother to negotiate peace by offering a ransom of 2 lakhs of rupees, Bedi refused. Rai Alyas was captured but later escaped and sought help from George Thomas, a mercenary leader from Hansi. ===George Thomas Expedition against Bedi=== George Thomas launched a military expedition against Bedi but faced fierce resistance. Sikh chiefs who had initially opposed Bedi later allied with him, cutting off Thomas's supplies. Ultimately, Thomas was forced to retreat, and Bedi consolidated his control over Ludhiana. == Aftermath == Following the Sikh victory, Baba Sahib Singh Bedi restored religious order in the captured territories. He banned cow slaughter, established police stations (thanas), rebuilt forts at Naobat, Dughri, and Ludhiana, and founded religious centers such as Gurdwara Damdama Sahib, Raipur. Although some British authors like Griffin and Francklin later accused Bedi of attempting to carve an independent kingdom, contemporary accounts and Sikh historians affirm that his primary goal was the religious reform and protection of Sikhs and Hindus in the Cis-Sutlej region. Baba Sahib Singh Bedi’s leadership during the campaign greatly enhanced Sikh religious influence and set the stage for future Sikh successes under leaders like Maharaja Ranjit Singh. ==Notes== == References == * * * http://www.sikh- heritage.co.uk/personalities/baba%20sahibsingh/sahibsingh.htm?utm_source=perplexity",
