 "text": "The Renault Twingo is a car made by Renault since 1993. The original Twingo launched in April 1993 in Europe and Colombia. It was never available in the UK with right hand drive. It had an unusual interior with a small digital instrument display. It received updates in 1998, 2000 and 2004. The second generation Twingo launched in 2007 and continued the design theme of the original. It was finally available with right hand drive for the UK market and was facelifted in 2011. The third generation Twingo launched in 2014 and now has 5 doors instead of 3. It was developed alongside the Smart ForFour but now has a normal instrument display. It was facelifted in 2019 but is no longer sold in the UK with right hand drive due to slow sales. == Gallery == File:BlackRenaultTwingo1998.jpg|Twingo I File:Renault Twingo front 20080402.jpg|Twingo II File:Renault Twingo (23033444306).jpg|Twingo III Twingo Category:1990s automobiles Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles",
