 "text": "Archivo is a grotesque sans serif typeface designed by HÃ©ctor Gatti and released in 2012. It is available on the Omnibus Type website. In 2016, it received an award at the Tipos Latinos Latin American typeface design competition. Archivo has two main variants, Archivo Narrow and Archivo Black. Archivo Narrow is a condensed version of the original, better for compact spaces like headlines. Archivo Black is thicker and has a more prominent appearance. The Archivo font family has a classic style similar of fonts from the 1800s. In 2021, it was updated to become a variable font, allowing it to vary in thickness and width. Archivo supports a lot of file formats, it also contains 641 glyphs and supports up to 200 languages, making it suitable for both print and online usage. Also, it is an open-source font, meaning one can freely use it without attribution or licensing fees for personal or commercial projects. You can also download it from GitHub, Google Fonts, and other sources online. == Other websites == * Official website * SIL Open Font License * Type specimen * Fonts In Use (Archivo) * Google Fonts * GitHub == References == Category:Fonts Category:Latin-script typefaces",
