 "text": "Three-player chess (sometimes known as three-man chess), is a chess variant that is made for three people to play. Some boards are made in hexagon, triangle or circle shaped. The three most common colours for the pieces are white, black and red (sometimes gray). ==Shapes of board== *Hexagon: When a three-player chess game is played on a hexagon board to the centre, the pieces move slightly different from their normal moves. *Triangle: When a three- player chess game is played on a triangle board, the pieces move very different from their normal moves due the shape of the board and the squares. *Circle: When a three-player chess game is played on a circle board, the pieces move almost the same from their normal moves, but pieces may pass through the centre, land on the centre or around the centre. If there are no pieces blocking its move for the rook and the queen around the centre, the rook and queen may move around the centre, but it may not end on the same square it started on. ==Related pages== *Chess variant *Chess Category:Chess variants",
