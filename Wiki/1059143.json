 "text": "The WAGR Pr class were a total of 18 express steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1938 to 1970. The Pr class (also officially known as the River class) were the result of building new locomotives to standard P class specifications with modifications at Midland Railway Workshops. The Pr class were named after rivers in Western Australia and operated almost exclusively on the Eastern Goldfields Railway during their passenger hauling career. Upon the event of dieselisation, the Pr and P class were re-assigned to goods work which they performed adequately until the demise of steam on the WAGR. The last Pr class, No. 521 (138) was withdrawn from service in 1970, it is now preserved and on display at the Bassendean Railway Museum. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
