 "text": "Robert Larry Mickey (October 21, 1943 â€“ July 23, 1982) was a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger. Mickey played a total of 11 years in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Chicago Black Hawks, New York Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, Philadelphia Flyers, and Buffalo Sabres. When he was playing in the Central Hockey League with the Omaha Knights, he was named to the first team of the All-Stars during the 1966-67 season. His team also made it to the Adams Cup finals the same year. On April 16, 1967, the night before the third game of the Adams Cup play-off series versus the Oklahoma City Blazers, Mickey got into a car accident on a country road near Seward, Nebraska. The crash was caused by the visibility of the road being almost zero because of dust that was blowing from a nearby field. Mickey suffered a broken left arm, cuts, and bruises. His wife Eleanor, who was a passenger in Mickey's car, died in the accident. On July 23, 1982, Mickey committed suicide in Buffalo, New York by sitting in his car while the engine was running in his garage. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1943 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Buffalo Bisons (AHL) players Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Canadian ice hockey right wingers Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Cincinnati Swords players Category:Ice hockey people from Alberta Category:Los Angeles Kings players Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:Montreal Voyageurs players Category:New York Rangers players Category:Philadelphia Flyers players Category:Sportspeople who committed suicide Category:Suicides in the United States Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Central Professional Hockey League players",
