Syncytia have cytoplasm and many nuclei, but are not divided into separate cells.King R.C. Stansfield W.D. & Mulligan P.K. 2006. A dictionary of genetics, 7th ed. Oxford. p435 == Examples == *Fungal hyphae are often syncytia. *Lichen tissue may be syncytia with enclosed algal or bacterial cells. *Many insect eggs develop by nuclear division without cell membranes. *Skeletal muscles in vertebrates are syncytia: it allows rapid coordinated contraction of muscles along their entire length. *The placenta of mammals is a syncytium. == References == Category:Cell biology",
