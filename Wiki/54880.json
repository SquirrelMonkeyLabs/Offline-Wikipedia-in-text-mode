 "text": "Apprenticeship is a system of training people who are learning how to do a job which needs special skill. Someone who is learning in this way is called an \"apprentice\". An apprentice will learn by working with someone who is already skilled at a job. They are like a teacher and pupil. == Development == The system of apprenticeship has been used for many hundreds of years. In the late Middle Ages the craft guilds and town governments used to watch and control the system. A master craftsman had the right to employ young people to work for them and pay them a small salary. In return the apprentice would be learning the trade. Most apprentices were males, but female apprentices are more common nowadays, especially in crafts such as embroidery, silk-weaving etc.. == Related pages == * Education ==Further reading== *Modern Apprenticeships: the way to work, The Report of the Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee, 2001 *Apprenticeship in the British \"Training Market\", Paul Ryan and Lorna Unwin, University of Cambridge and University of Leicester, 2001 *Creating a ‘Modern Apprenticeship’: a critique of the UK’s multi-sector, social inclusion approach Alison Fuller and Lorna Unwin, 2003 (pdf) *Apprenticeship systems in England and Germany: decline and survival.
