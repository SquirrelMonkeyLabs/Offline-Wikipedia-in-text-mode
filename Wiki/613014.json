 "text": "The Blue Party (German: Die blaue Partei) was a right-wing conservative political party in Germany. It was formed on 17 September 2017 and dissolved in 2019. It split from the AfD after the 2017 election. The party tried to attract moderate former AfD voters. The Blue Party was eurosceptic (meaning they were critical of the European Union). The party also wanted more restrictions on immigration. Many of the party's policies were similar to those of the AfD. == References == == Other websites == * Official Webpage of \"BÃ¼rgerforum Blaue Wende\" Category:Political parties in Germany Category:Conservative parties Category:Eurosceptic parties Category:2010s establishments in Germany Category:2017 establishments in Europe Category:2010s disestablishments in Germany",
