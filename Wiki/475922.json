In 2011, the newspaper's office was firebombed because the cover of an issue of the newspaper called \"Charia Hebdo\" had a cartoon of Prophet Muhammad on it. The newspaper's editor-in-chief Stéphane \"Charb\" Charbonnier was added to Al-Qaeda's most wanted list in 2013. ==Events== They shot and killed 12 people, including Charlie Hebdo staff and two French National police officers, and wounded 11 others. In Niger, churches and cars were burned in protest of Muhammed on the cover of Charlie Hebdo. * * * * * * The gunmen entered the building and began shooting with automatic weapons, while shouting \"Allahu Akbar\". Up to 50 shots were fired during the attack. Following a massive manhunt, the French police believe they have located the attackers and are mounting an operation against them. On Twitter, users showed support for freedom of speech with the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie. ==Aftermath== ===Victims=== * Cabu, 76, cartoonist * Tignous, 57, cartoonist * Philippe Honoré, 73, cartoonist * Georges Wolinski, 80, cartoonist * Charb, 47, caricaturist and journalist * Bernard Maris, 68, economist and journalist * Elsa Cayat, 54, psychoanalyst and columnist ===Perpetrators=== Saïd Kouachi and Chérif Kouachi were identified by French police as the main suspects in the shooting. The two Franco-Algerian brothers, both from Gennevilliers, are aged 34 and 32, respectively. In 2008, Chérif Kouachi was convicted of terrorism charges and sentenced to three years in prison, along with 18 months of suspension, for having assisted in sending fighters to Iraq's insurgency. Hamyd Mourad, an 18-year-old homeless man of unknown nationality, was identified by the police as a third suspect in the shooting. ==Related pages== * 2025 Pahalgam Massacre * April 2017 Champs-Élysées attack * 2025 D.C.
