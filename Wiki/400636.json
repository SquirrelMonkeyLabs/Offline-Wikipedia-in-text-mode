 "text": "In Norse mythology, Vili and Vé are the brothers of Odin. It is said that these three gods made the world. In Old Norse, vili means \"will\", and vé refers to a type of Germanic shrine. There are many theories as to other connections Vili and Vé had to the wider scope of Norse mythology, however there is not anything confirmed beyond their involvement in slaying Ymir and creating the world and the first humans. It is theorized that Vili is in actuality the god Hœnir and that Vé is the god Lóðurr, but this is still debated. There is no mention of the siblings of Odin after the Völuspá. _NOTICE: ALL \"INFORMATION\" BELOW THIS TEXT IS BOTH UNTRUE AND UNSOURCED!_ Vé is also known as the god of the seas. He once challenged Odin to a duel over the throne of Asgard. Odin won, and sent his brother to the underworld as punishment. Vili, however, was loyal to Odin. Since Odin wore gold armour, his brothers Vili wore silver and Vé wore bronze. When Odin threw Vé into the underworld, Vé's armour was taken from him. Eventually, when Ragnarök began, Vé was given back his armour, sword, and powers to join Odin and Vili on a quest to kill the wolf Fenrir. When Fenrir swallowed Odin, his brother Vili thought the war was over and there were no hope so he sacrificed himself to Fenrir. Vé fled after Vili sacrificed himself, but Fenrir found him in the realm of the elves and ate him. However some people may say that Fenrir never ate Vé and that he was shot in the head with an arrow by an elf who had mistaken him for his nephew Loki. (Loki is not the nephew of Vé, or related to him) Category:Norse gods and goddesses",
