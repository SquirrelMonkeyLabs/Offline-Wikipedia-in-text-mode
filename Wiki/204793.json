 "text": "Molar conductivity is a scientific term. The molar conductivity of an electrolyte shows how well that electrolyte can conduct electricity in solution. That conductivity can be shown as a number. The molar conductivity of an electrolyte is a measure of how well it conducts electricity in solution. It is calculated by dividing the conductivity (how well the electrolyte conducts electricity) by the molar concentration (how much the electrolyte is diluted: a solution means that it has been dissolved in something else: see solution). In short, Molar conductivity increases with the decrease in concentration. It is measured in siemens metre 2 per molarity (S m2 mol−1). The symbol for molar conductivity is Λ, or Λm.Castellan, G.W.
