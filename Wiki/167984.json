According to the 2001 census, 1342 people were living there. == Location == Solomonovo lies between the Latorica and Tisza rivers, near the Ukraine-Hungary-Slovakia border triangle, close to Chop. Its area is 2,009 hectares. Neighboring settlements are Chop and Záhony. Administratively, it includes the Strazh colony, settled during the Czech period and now inhabited by Ukrainians. The village belonged to Hungary (Ung County) from 1000 to 1920 and again from 1938 to 1944, was part of Czechoslovakia from 1920 to 1938, and has been part of Zakarpattia since 1945. Solomonovo is in western Zakarpattia, on the Chop-Mukachevo plain of the Zakarpattia Lowland. The Tisza flows south of the village, and the Latorica flows north. The rivers shaped the main landforms around it. Most of the area is now farmland, gardens, meadows, and pastures, with wooded areas only along the river floodplains. Until the 1850s, the lands around the village were covered by ancient forests, which were gradually cut down. Before river regulations, Solomonovo was often threatened by floods from the Tisza and Latorica. ==Resources== * Solomonovo – karpataljaturizmus.net * Solomonovo (Соломоновo) of Ukraine 1:100,000 topographic maps Category:Villages in Ukraine Category:Settlements of Uzhhorod District",
