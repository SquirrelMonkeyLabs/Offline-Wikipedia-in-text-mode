 "text": "Dick Whittington, properly Sir Richard Whittington (1354 – March 1423), was four times Lord Mayor of London, a member of parliament and a Sheriff of London. He had no children and left his fortune (£7,000 equivalent to £6,300,000 in 2021) to form the Charity of Sir Richard Whittington. His life was well known. He became a character in an English story that was adapted for the stage as a play, The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe byrth, his great fortune, in February 1604. This was turned into a pantomime called Dick Whittington and His Cat. This tells how Dick, a boy from a poor Gloucestershire family, sets out for London to make his fortune, accompanied by, or later acquiring, his cat. At first he meets with little success, and is tempted to return home. However, on his way out of the city, whilst climbing Highgate Hill he hears the Bow Bells of London ringing, and believes they are sending him a message. There is now a large hospital on Highgate Hill, named the Whittington Hospital. A traditional rhyme associated with this tale is: > Turn again, Whittington, Once Lord Mayor of London! Turn again, Whittington, > Twice Lord Mayor of London! Turn again, Whittington, Thrice Lord Mayor of > London! == References == Category:Mayors of London Category:1354 Category:1423 deaths",
