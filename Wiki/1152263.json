 "text": "The Korpiselkä Prayer House Community (Finnish: Korpiselän rukoushuonekunta) was a Lutheran religious community in Korpiselkä, located in Finnish Karelia. The community was established to provide spiritual services in this remote region during the early 20th century. == History == === Formation === The prayer house community was formed as part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland to address the needs of rural populations in areas far from larger parish churches. Korpiselkä was one such area, and the community grew as local residents sought access to religious services closer to home. === Expansion === The community built its own prayer house, which served as a center for worship, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. It became a focal point for spiritual and social gatherings. === Post-War changes === After the Winter War (1939–1940) and the Continuation War (1941–1944), Korpiselkä became part of Soviet territory due to the cession of Finnish Karelia. The prayer house was abandoned, and its members were relocated to other parts of Finland. == Architecture == The prayer house was a modest wooden building, typical of rural Finnish religious structures. It featured: * A simple rectangular layout. * Minimal interior decoration, reflecting the functional focus of Lutheran worship. * A small bell tower added later to signal worship services. == Legacy == Although the Korpiselkä Prayer House Community no longer exists, it remains an important part of Finnish religious history. It symbolizes the dedication to maintaining spiritual life in remote areas and the cultural losses incurred during Finland’s territorial changes.
