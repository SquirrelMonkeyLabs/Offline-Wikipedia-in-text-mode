 "text": "Matthew Hopkins (c. 1620 – 12 August 1647) was a witch-hunter. His 3-year career began in 1645 during the time of the English Civil War and ended in 1647. Matthew and his colleague John Stearne were responsible for the rising number of witch hunts during that time. At the end, more people were hanged for being witches because of witch accusations than in the previous 100 years.Russell 1981: pp. 97–98Thomas 1971: p. 537, ... in Essex there were no executions after 1626 until 1645. It is believed the number of deaths due to them was about 300 women. His witchhunts mainly took place in the eastern counties of Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, and occasionally in Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, and Huntingdonshire. Very little is known of Matthew Hopkins before 1644. There are no documents from that time about him or his family. Cabell 2006: p. 9; it is the author's opinion that \"unfortunately one cannot dispute that all Hopkins documentation was deliberately destroyed after his death\". He was born in Great Wenham, Suffolk.Gaskill 2005: p. 9Deacon 1976: p. 13 His father, James Hopkins, was a Puritan clergyman in Suffolk.Deacon 1976: pp. 13, 17 Hopkins wrote in his book The Discovery of WitchesThe Discovery of Witches – In Answer to Several Queries, Lately Delivered to the Judges of Assize for the County of Norfolk; London; 1674 that he \"never travelled far... to gain his experience\".Cabell 2006: p. 15 In the early 1640s Hopkins moved to Manningtree, Essex near Colchester. According to tradition Hopkins used his inheritanceGaskill 2005: p. 23 to establish himself as a gentleman and to buy the Thorn Inn in Mistley.Gaskill 2005: p. 27 From the way that he gave evidence in trials, Hopkins is thought to have been trained as a lawyer, but there is little evidence to prove this. Matthew Hopkins died at his home in Manningtree, Essex, on 12 August 1647, probably of tuberculosis. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * * * Category:People from Suffolk Category:1647 deaths Category:1620s births",
