 "text": "Destiny whose real name is Steven Kenneth Bonnell the Second, is a YouTuber whose channel started off about video games but then became about left-wing politics. Destiny has debates with people who support right-wing politics and sometimes with people on the far-left. One of Destinyâ€™s goals with his channel is to prove the alt-right wrong. Destiny has debated Nick Fuentes and other white nationalists, including Richard B. Spencer. Destiny voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Destiny supports Israel in its war with Hamas. In a debate with Trent Horn, Destiny said he was very Pro-choice and that the morality of abortion was entirely about the results it had for society. Following the assassination attempt against former-U.S. President Donald J. Trump, Destiny tweeted sarcastic complaints about the shooting. Destiny also said that he would only say the shooting was bad when Conservatives said that about the January 6th riot. == References == Category:American YouTubers",
