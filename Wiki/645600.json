Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly rather a Republican-hired investigator. Ford said that they were both “visibly drunk” and that Kavanaugh had locked her into a bedroom, where he groped her and tried to take off her clothes. She said she “believed he was going to rape me” and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were politically motivated by Democrats and Bill Clinton. After Ford opened up about her accusations, two more women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault/harassment. Deborah Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself when they were at Yale. Later, former government employee Julie Swetnick, accused Kavanaugh of drugging her and raping her in a gang rape. After the Senate committee vote, Senators Flake, Manchin and Murkowski called for an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. President Trump ordered a limited investigation. ===Attempted assassination=== In the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide. After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh because he was not happy with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.
