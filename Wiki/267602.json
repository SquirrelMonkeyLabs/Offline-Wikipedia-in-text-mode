 "text": "Sodium tellurite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Na2TeO3. It contains sodium and tellurite ions. == Properties == Sodium tellurite is a colorless solid. The tellurite ion can react with water to make sodium hydrogen tellurite, NaHTeO3. It dissolves in water easily. It is a weak oxidizing agent (can be reduced to tellurium) and a weak reducing agent (can be oxidized to tellurates). It is part of the process in making tellurium. == Preparation == It is made by reacting tellurium dioxide with sodium hydroxide, or by heating a telluride in air with sodium carbonate. == Uses == Sodium tellurite is used in making tellurium. It is also used to make electroplated nickel corrosion-resistant. It can also be used to add a bluish coating to steel. It can be used to isolate certain types of bacteria that it is not toxic to. == Related pages == *Sodium selenite *Sodium tellurate Category:Tellurium compounds Category:Sodium compounds",
