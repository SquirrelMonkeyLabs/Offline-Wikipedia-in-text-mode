 "text": "The Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling is the Oscar given to the best achievement in makeup and hair-styling for movies. Usually, only three movies are nominated each year rather than five as in most categories. In 2012, the category was renamed to Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. == Special Achievement Awards == Before 1981, Special Achievement Oscars were twice awarded to makeup artists for their work on a specific movie: * 1964 - William J. Tuttle for 7 Faces of Dr. Lao * 1968 - John Chambers for Planet of the Apes ==Hairstylists== Starting in 1993, the award is to be shared with hairstylists if hair effects \"contribute greatly to the appearance and effect of the characters\". ==Winners and nominees== The winners are in bold text with a blue background. ===1980s=== Year Movie Nominees 1981 (54th) An American Werewolf in London Rick Baker Heartbeeps Stan Winston 1982 (55th) Gandhi Tom Smith Quest for Fire Sarah Monzani Michèle Burke 1984 (57th) Amadeus Paul LeBlanc Dick Smith Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes Rick Baker Paul Engelen 2010 Michael Westmore 1985 (58th) The Color Purple Ken Chase Mask Michael Westmore Zoltan Elek Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins Carl Fullerton 1986 (59th) The Clan of the Cave Bear Michael Westmore Michèle Burke The Fly Chris Walas Stephan Dupuis Legend Rob Bottin Peter Robb-King 1987 (60th) Happy New Year Bob Laden Harry and the Hendersons Rick Baker 1988 (61st) Beetlejuice Ve Neill Steve La Porte Robert Short Coming to America Rick Baker Scrooged Tom Burman Bari Dreiband-Burman 1989 (62nd) The Adventures of Baron Munchausen Maggie Weston Fabrizio Sforza Dad Dick Smith Ken Diaz Greg Nelson Driving Miss Daisy Manlio Rocchetti Lynn Barber Kevin Haney ===1990s=== Year Movie Nominees 1990 (63rd) Cyrano de Bergerac Michèle Burke Jean-Pierre Eychenne Dick Tracy John Caglione, Jr. Doug Drexler Edward Scissorhands Ve Neill Stan Winston 1991 (64th) Hook Christina Smith Monty Westmore Greg Cannom Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country Michael Mills Edward French Richard Snell Terminator 2: Judgment Day Stan Winston Jeff Dawn 1992 (65th) Batman Returns Ve Neill Ronnie Specter Stan Winston Bram Stoker's Dracula Greg Cannom Michèle Burke Matthew W.
