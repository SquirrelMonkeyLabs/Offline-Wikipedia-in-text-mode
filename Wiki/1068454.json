 "text": "Lancelot Thomas Hogben FRS FRSE (9 December 1895 – 22 August 1975) was a British experimental zoologist and medical statistician. He developed the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) as a model organism for biological research in his early career. He also attacked the eugenics movement in the middle of his career, and wrote popular books on science, mathematics and language in his later career. He created an international language, Interglossa, as 'a draft of an auxiliary for a democratic world order'. == Biography == === Early life and education === Hogben was born and grew up in Southsea, near Portsmouth in Hampshire. His parents were Methodists. In 1907, his family moved to Stoke Newington in London, where his mother had grown up. He went to Tottenham County School and later studied physiology as a medical student at Trinity College, Cambridge. Before going to Cambridge, Hogben enrolled as an external student at the University of London and earned a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in 1914. He got his degree from Cambridge in 1915, finishing with a basic (Ordinary) Bachelor of Arts (BA). During this time, he became a socialist. He changed the name of the university’s Fabian Society to the Socialist Society and joined the Independent Labour Party. Later in life, he called himself a \"scientific humanist.\" === World War I === During the First World War, Hogben was a pacifist (against war) and joined the Quakers. He worked for six months in France with the Red Cross, helping people affected by the war as part of the Friends’ War Victims Relief Service and the Friends’ Ambulance Unit. After returning to Cambridge, he was jailed in 1916 at Wormwood Scrubs because he refused to fight in the war (as a conscientious objector). His health got worse in prison, so he was released in 1917. His brother George was also a conscientious objector and worked with the Friends’ Ambulance Unit. === Personal life === In 1918, Hogben married Enid Charles, who was a mathematician, statistician, socialist, and feminist from Denbigh. They had two sons and two daughters together. Hogben also learned to speak Welsh. In the 1950s, he moved to Glyn Ceiriog in North Wales and bought a small cottage. During that time, his marriage with Enid ended. They separated in 1953 and got divorced in 1957. Later that same year, he married Jane Roberts (born Evans), a local retired school headmistress who was seven years younger than him. Jane passed away in 1974, and Hogben died the following year, in 1975, at the War Memorial Hospital in Wrexham. He was 79 years old and was cremated at Pentre Bychan nearby. Hogben was an atheist and called himself a \"scientific humanist.\" ==Books he published== *A Short Life of Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), p. 64 (London, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1918)Reprinted from Notes and Records of the Royal Society, London, 1999; vol. 53: pp. 361-369, part 2 *Exiles of the Snow, and Other Poems (1918) *An Introduction to Recent Advances in Comparative Physiology (1924) with Frank R.
