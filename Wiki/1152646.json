 "text": "US West Communications was a telecommunications network. It was created in 1984 just after the Bell System breakup. They did business with fourteen Midwest, Pacific and Rocky Mountain states. They included Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, Idaho, Colorado and Minnesota. US West was made up of the Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell (NWBT) and Pacific Northwest Bell (PNB) companies. In the 1990s, those three companies were combined. In 1994, they stopped operating. However, the NWBT and PNB companies have a strong chance of being brought back one day. In June 2000, US West ended when Qwest Communications took over the operation service areas in which US West operated. ==References== Category:2000 disestablishments in the United States Category:Defunct companies of the United States Category:American telephone companies",
