 "text": "The Carlisle Indian Industrial School (or Carlisle Indian School) was a boarding school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. It operated between 1879 and 1918. It was located in the old barracks. It was there to educate Native American children (which were called \"Indians\" at the time). The problem with these schools was that the children were told what America was like, but they were not told, what their people were like. This process was called assimilation, and was done on purpose. It means that some of the cultural values were lost. With the beginning of the first World War, the school was closed, and the property again was used by the military. Today, all of it is part of the United States Army War College.
