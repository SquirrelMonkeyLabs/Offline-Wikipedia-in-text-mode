For 2017, the Ukrainian Government has provided €42.8 million, of which more than €16 million will be spent on Eurovision. That leaves the broadcaster with just €7 million Euros, which is clearly too low money for other projects in the future, according to Zurab. * For the first time ever, Russia got drawn in the second semi-final. Russia always participated in the first semi-final since the introduction of semi-finals. * Belarus will be represented by a song in Belarussian language for the first time. * Christer Björkmann, a Swedish TV-producer for the national final Melodifestivalen and show producer of the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 and 2016, will join the Ukrainian producing team. * For the first time ever, there will be only men who will host the contest. ==References== Category:2017 in Europe Category:2017 in music Category:2010s in Ukraine Category:21st century in Kyiv 2017 Category:Music of Ukraine",
