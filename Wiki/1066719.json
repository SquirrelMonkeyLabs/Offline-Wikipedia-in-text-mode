 "text": "The Abydos King List of Ramesses II, also known as the Fragmentary Abydos King List or the Fragmentary Abydos Table, is a list of kings of Ancient Egypt. Just like with the Abydos King List created by Seti I, Ramesses II's copy also lists pharaohs of ancient pharaohs. Due to it's condiction and it being a copy of Seti's list, Ramesses's list is often ignored. The fragments of his lists were removed by the French consul and sold to the British Museum.. It was written on a wall of the Temple of Ramesses II at Abydos, Egypt. The surviving list has two rows of cartouches (borders around the name of a king) in each row. The upper two rows list the kings, while the third row repeats Ramesses II's throne name and praenomen. It lists the Old Kingdom kings in the order in which they ruled. Due to it's condiction, not all pharaohs have their names on the list. This names of some earlier pharaohs who were not seen to be lawful rulers â€” such as Akhenaten, Hatshepsut, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamen, and Ay, have been left out of the list. == The king list == The names are listed in reverse chronological order from the upper right to the bottom left, as they were meant to be read.
