The adult male frog is 26.1-34.7 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 34.9-35.4 mm long. There is more webbed skin on the back feet than on the front feet. The skin of the frog's back is brown or light brown in color with a darker mark in the shape of the letter Y. The male frog has an organ on its neck for making sounds. This frog lives in bamboo forests on hills with evergreen and broadleaf trees. People have seen it between 600 and 1600 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog's eggs in water in bamboo plants. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Dawuling Nature Reserve, Mangshan Nature Reserve, Nanling Nature Reserve, and Mount Nankun Nature Reserve. However, this frog is still in small danger. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to build roads and farms. Visitors to the parks can bother this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
