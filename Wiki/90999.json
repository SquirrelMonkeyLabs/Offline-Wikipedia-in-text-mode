Its capital is Jérémie. == Geography == The Départment de la Grand'Anse has an area of 2,091 km². It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Gonâve, to the east by the Nippes Department, to the south by the Sud Department, and by the Caribbean Sea to the west. The Massiff de la Hotte, an important Haitian mountain range, runs from west to east along the south of the department, with the Plymouth, Macaya and Casetaches mountain ranges. Because of this, rivers here are short; some of them are Baradères, Dame-Marie, de la Grande-Anse, de Nippes, des Roseaux and Voldrogue. == Administrative division == The department is divided into three arrondissements (like districts) and 11 communes (like municipalities). The \"arrondissements\" and their \"communes\" are: # Anse d'Hainault ## Anse-d'Hainault ## Dame-Marie ## Les Irois # Corail ## Beaumont ## Corail ## Pestel ## Roseaux # Jérémie ## Abricots ## Bonbon ## Chambellan ## Jérémie ## Moron == References == Category:Departments of Haiti",
