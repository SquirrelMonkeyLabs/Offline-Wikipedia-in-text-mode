 "text": "Kintore (Pintupi: Waá¸»ungurru; ) is a remote town in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is about west of Alice Springs and close to the border with Western Australia. Almost all the people who live there are Aboriginal, and most are Pintupi. Kintore was founded in 1981. Many Pintupi people who lived in the community of Papunya (to the east) decided to move back to their own country. They had been forced to leave these lands decades before because of weapons testing at Woomera in South Australia. Kintore is a major centre for the Western Desert art movement, which began at Papunya during the 1970s. The paintings made here are visual descriptions of dreamtime stories. They have gained fame around the world. A number of members of the Aboriginal art school Papunya Tula live at Kintore.
