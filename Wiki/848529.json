 "text": "A P-pop idol (also called P-idol, Pinoy pop idol, Pinoy idols or Filipino idol) is a Filipino singer and dancer that works in P-pop music industry, similar to what Japanese idols are to J-pop. P-pop idols may be members of a band, but are mostly soloists. They are strongly affected by pop culture from Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan. There are two waves or generations of idols. ==History== During the 2000s and 2010s, the genres of J-pop, K-pop and C-pop began to spread to Western countries. K-pop spread to Southeast Asia and created a huge influence on the Filipino entertainment industry. P-pop groups imitate many characteristics of J-pop, K-pop and C-pop to become famous, including: fashion style, choreography, music arrangement, etc. However, overseas music sales are not growing as quickly as expected. P-pop trending groups include: Bini, BGYO, SB19 and 1st.One. In addition, the Japanese group AKB48 brand once decided to expand its reach to Philippines in 2018 and released the group MNL48. ==P-pop idols== ===2018â€“present=== 1st generation *MNL48 **Baby Blue *SB19 *Clover *1st.One *BGYO *Bini *Luna *Daydream *Alamat ==Related pages== *Japanese idol *P-pop *J-pop *K-pop *C-pop Idol Category:Celebrity",
