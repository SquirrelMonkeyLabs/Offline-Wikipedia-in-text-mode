 "text": "The snowshoe hare is Lepus americanus, found in North America. It is a kind of hare adapted to cold climates. It is white in colour in the winter. A major predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx. There are historical records of animals caught by fur hunters over hundreds of years. The records show show the lynx and hare numbers rising and falling in a cycle. This has made the hare a case study of the relationship between numbers of predators and their prey. == References == Category:Lagomorphs Category:Mammals of North America",
