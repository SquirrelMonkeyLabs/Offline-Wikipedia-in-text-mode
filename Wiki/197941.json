 "text": "Hardelot Castle () is a castle in Pas-de-Calais in France. It is in a field next to the village of Condette, and south of the city of Boulogne-sur-Mer. The first castle at this place was built in the 12th century by the Counts of Boulogne. The present castle was built by Count Philippe Hurepel of Clermont in 1222. The castle was captured several times by the French, the English and the Burgundians. The 'pseudo Gothic' style mansion was built in 1848 by Sir John Hare. He demolished the existing buildings inside the walls of the old castle, and used a tower and underground passages from the 13th century as the basis of his building. In 1899, Sir John Whitley bought the site and then created the seaside resort of Hardelot, making the castle the main centre of the estate with bedrooms, food, and activities like golf, fishing and tennis. ==External reference== * The Chateau in the Mérimée database.
