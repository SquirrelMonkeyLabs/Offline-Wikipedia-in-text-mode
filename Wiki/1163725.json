 "text": "Janggi (also known as Korean chess), is a board game from Korea. Janggi is similar to Xiangqi (Chinese chess), but some pieces in Janggi have different movements. The game is mostly played in the Korean Peninsula. Unlike in Xiangqi, there is no river in Janggi and like in Xiangqi, it is played on intersections and their palaces are on the back row of their side with an X shaped. The board setup is similar to Xiangqi, but in some games the horse and the elephant may switch places on either side. The board is 9x10 just like in Xiangqi. ==Pieces and movement== *General (King): Moves along the palace lines (X shaped). *Advisor (Guard): Moves along the palace lines (X shaped). *Elephant: Moves one square in a straight line then two squares diagonally (it can also be blocked). *Horse (Knight): Moves the same as the Knight in chess, but it cannot jump over other pieces. *Chariot (Rook): Moves the same as the Rook in chess, but it can also move on the palace diagonals. *Cannon: Moves the same as the Chariot but to move or capture, it must jump one piece then land on the other side, but it can also jump a piece on the palace diagonals. *Soldier (Pawn): Moves one space directly forward or sideways, but it can also move on their opponent's palace diagonals. ==Related pages== *History of chess *Shogi *Xiangqi ==References== Category:Chess variants",
