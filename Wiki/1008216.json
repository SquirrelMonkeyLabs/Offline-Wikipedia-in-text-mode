 "text": "iOS jailbreaking is the process of removing the software restrictions imposed by Apple on its iOS operating system. This allows users to gain root access to their iOS devices, to modify the device's software and install apps from sources outside of the Apple App Store. Jailbreaking dates back to the early days of the iPhone. == History == Jailbreaking first became popular in 2007 with the release of the original iPhone. The first jailbreaking tool was developed by a group of hackers known as the iPhone Dev Team. The tool allowed users to modify their iPhones, install third-party applications, and customize the appearance of the user interface. Over the years, jailbreaking became more mainstream. A thriving community of developers and enthusiasts emerged. Many of the early jailbreaking tools were based on exploits found in iOS, which allowed users to bypass Apple's security measures. In 2010, the US government made it legal to jailbreak an iPhone, saying that jailbreaking did not violate copyright laws. This helped to further legitimize jailbreaking and brought it into the mainstream. == Jailbreaking Today == Jailbreaking is still popular among iOS users, although it has become less common. This is partly due to the increased security measures implemented by Apple in recent versions of iOS. Jailbreaking can void the device's warranty. It potentially leaves the device vulnerable to security threats. There are still many jailbreaking tools and communities available for those interested in modifying their iOS devices. They develop new tweaks, apps, and tools to enhance the functionality and customization of iOS devices. == Modern Jailbreaks == Modernized Jailbreaks Name Versions palera1n 15.0 - 16.4 Odysseyra1n 14.4 - 14.8.1 Taurine 14.0 - 14.3 Odyssey 13.0 - 13.7 Chimera 12.0 - 12.4.1 Electra 11.0 - 11.4.1 unc0ver 11.0 - 14.8 == Classic Jailbreaks == iOS Version Jailbreak Name Jailbreak Developers iOS 10.0 - 10.2 Yalu102 Luca Todesco iOS 9.2 - 9.3.3 Pangu9 Pangu Team iOS 9.0 - 9.1 Pangu9 Pangu Team iOS 8.0 - 8.1.2 TaiG TaiG Team iOS 7.1 - 7.1.2 Pangu7 Pangu Team iOS 7.0 - 7.0.6 evasi0n7 evad3rs iOS 6.0 - 6.1.2 evasi0n evad3rs iOS 5.1.1 Absinthe 2.0 Chronic Dev Team and iPhone Dev Team iOS 5.0.1 - 5.1.1 Redsn0w iPhone Dev Team iPhoneOS 1.1.1 - 1.1.4 JailbreakMe 1.0 comex iPhoneOS 1.0 - 1.1.1 JailbreakMe 1.0 comex == References == Category:Apple software",
