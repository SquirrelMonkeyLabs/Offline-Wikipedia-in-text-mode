 "text": "Kaikatt's bush frog (Raorchestes kaikatti) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat Mountains. People have seen this frog between 600 and 1000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 24.9 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is gray-brown in color with light gray and dark brown places. The belly is gray-white in color. Parts of the legs and middle are dark brown in color. The iris of the eye is brown in color. Scientists named the frog for the place where they found it: Kaikatti. The place in Kaikatti was about 1000 meters above sea level. Scientists found the frog again later, in small pieces of evergreen forest. The frog lives in the high in the trees where the branches come together like a roof, as high as 5 meters above the ground. People also found the frog on coffee farms and other farms near forests. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place. Scientists think this frog is not good at living in places that human beings have changed. Human beings cut down the forests where it lives to make farms and build things for visitors. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
