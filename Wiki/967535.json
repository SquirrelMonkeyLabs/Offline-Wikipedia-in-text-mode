 "text": "The NOvA (NuMI Off-axis νe Appearance) experiment is about one of nature’s most elusive particles: neutrinos. ==History== Since the late 1990s, physicists knew that neutrinos show a quantum mechanical behavior called oscillations. But this behavior is not predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. NOvA is working to better understand these particles by precision measurements of their oscillation properties. ==Team== The NOvA co- spokespersons are Patricia Vahle (William & Mary) and Alex Himmel (Fermilab). The team is made up of more than 260 scientists and engineers from 48 institutions in eight countries. Category:Physics experiments",
