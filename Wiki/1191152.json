 "text": "«Flesh and Bone» is a pop-rock song from the third studio album by Norwegian singer Marion Raven, the single was the first of two released to promote the album called Nevermore which was cancelled by the label for unclear reasons, the song was only released for sale in Norway through iTunes and was met with poor reviews and sales, unlike its successor Found Someone which was met with better sales, reaching #4 on the Norwegian charts. The single was classified as a commercial failure and received no promotion from the record label; Raven only sang it a couple of times and it was just another song. The single premiered on the show \"Moods Of Norway\" as part of a show at Oslo Fashion Week on August 20, 2010. \"Flesh and Bone\" has at least two studio versions, the one released as a single for iTunes, and the version on the Nevermore album, between both versions there are small but noticeable differences in both the music and Raven's voice which is less distorted in the album version.",
