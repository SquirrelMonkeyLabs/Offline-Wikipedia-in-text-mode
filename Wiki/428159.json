Teller did not speak until he was three years old. He left Hungary in 1926. He moved to Germany. He went to the University of Karlsruhe there. He then went to the University of Leipzig.

In 1941 he stopped working at George Washington University. He joined the Manhattan Project in 1942. At the time it was called the Manhattan Engineering District.

In 1953 Teller became a professor at the University of California. He was on the cover of TIME magazine in 1957.

Teller was given one of the first Ig Nobel Prizes for Peace in 1991. ===21st century=== In 2000, Teller's wife died. In 2001, a book Teller wrote about his life, Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey In Science And Politics, was published by Basic Books. Teller was 93. ==Death== He died from a stroke on September 9, 2003 at Stanford University. ==Views== Teller was an agnostic.Edward Teller (2002). Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey In Science And Politics. Basic Books. p. 32. . \"Religion was not an issue in my family; indeed, it was never discussed. My only religious training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet my father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years.\" He also was a Republican. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Jewish American academics Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Scientists from Budapest Category:Refugees from Nazism Category:American theoretical physicists Category:Hungarian physicists",
