 "text": "Road safety is safety in using roads. Most years, traffic collisions kill about a million people worldwide. There are ways to make this less common, so roads will be safer for motor traffic, cyclists and pedestrians. It involves rules such as speed limits and those about drinking and driving, and control systems such as traffic lights and crossings. These are used to increase safety and reduce the chance of accidents. == References == Category:Road transport Category:Safety",
