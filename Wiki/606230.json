Oxford : Pergamon Press. ==Career== While working at British Thomson-Houston that he invented holography, in 1947. He experimented with a heavily filtered mercury arc light source. However, the earliest hologram was only realised in 1964 following the 1960 invention of the laser, the first coherent light source. After this, holography became commercially available. ==Personal life== During his time in Rugby, he met Marjorie Louise Butler, and they married in 1936. He became a British citizen in 1946. ==Awards== * 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics ==References== Category:British electrical engineers Category:British physicists Category:1900 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Nobel Prize in Physics winners",
