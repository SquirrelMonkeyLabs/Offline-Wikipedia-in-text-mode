Formerly the people in the Dietzenbach area were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine-Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working, leather manufacturing and chemical processing. Many men became workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly. == Twinned cities == * Vélizy- Villacoublay, France * Masaya, Nicaragua * Rakovník, Czech Republic * Neuhaus am Rennweg, Germany * Oconomowoc, USA * Kostjukovitschi, Belarus == References == == Other websites == *Official website of Dietzenbach * Category:Offenbach (district)",
