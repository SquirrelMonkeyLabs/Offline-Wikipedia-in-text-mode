 "text": "The grey partridge (Perdix perdix) is a 30 cm tall bird. It is brown-backed and has grey flanks and chest. The belly is white, usually marked with a large chestnut-brown horse-shoe mark. This mark should not only be the detail to divide into male or female partridge. When disturbed or if it feels danger, it flies a short distance. The song is a harsh kieerr-ik or keev-it and often calling rick rick rick or it-it-it. Partridges live in open country including farmland, moorland, downs, steppes, semi-desserts and sand dunes. They prefer a warm and dry climate. They eat grains, seeds and small insects. The scientific name is the Latin for \"partridge\", and is itself derived from Ancient Greek perdix. == References == == Other websites == Category:Phasianidae Category:Birds of Europe Category:Birds of North America",
