 "text": "High school is a kind of school, a place where people go to learn skills for use in life. In a three-part system such as in the United States, children go to high school after middle school (\"junior high\"). In a two-part system such as in South Africa and the United Kingdom, the change is from primary school to secondary school at around 12 years and 11 years of age respectively. High school is also sometimes called an senior high school or just senior high. In the United States, a high school is a school that students go to usually for grades 9 through 12, from the ages of about 14-15 to about 17-18. It is also the last school that the law requires the student to go to. However, students with behavioral issues that are too much for the school to handle cannot attend. This is called expulsion. Some states have an age or certain grade where a student does not have to attend school, this is called the compulsory age, for example in New York, students below 17 years of age are required to attend school unless the child is excused. Some people may choose to take some tests called GED (General Education Development) as another way to finish high school. A student is allowed by law to stop going to high school after a certain age without having graduated. In most this is 16, however, in a few states, it is 18 or higher, for example, Wisconsin. In the United Kingdom, the law requires the student to go to school until 16. The term 'high school' is only used in Scotland. The term 'secondary School' is used for most of the UK instead of 'high school'. 'Secondary school' is the school year between 7-11; which are pupils aged 11-16. There are public high schools and private high schools in the United States and many other countries. ==References== education Category:Types of educational institutions",
