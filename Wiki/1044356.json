 "text": "\"Royalty\" is the first single off of American rapper XXXTentacion's fourth and final studio album Bad Vibes Forever. The song was released on July 19, 2019. British rapper Stefflon Don and Jamaican musicians Vybz Kartel and Ky-Mani Marley also appear on the song. The song was first supposed to be released on deluxe version of X's second studio album ? but ended up on Bad Vibes Forever instead. A month before he died, X announced on instagram that Vybz Kartel would appear on the song. During an interview with Billboard, X's manager Solomon Sobande said that X made the song as a tribute to his Jamaican roots, saying: \"That’s [X’s] culture. He’s of Jamaican descent. In the house he was probably listening to Bob Marley and all these guys. As he grows up and finds his own people, he was a huge fan of Vybz Kartel. Through his family’s descent, they had relationships with families like the Marleys. That’s how he [connected] with Ky-Mani [Marley]. It was a dream of him to get with Vybz at the time because he was locked up. Stefflon [Don] was the sprinkle on top, but that was really paying homage to his culture\". A music video for the song was released. In the video, shots of different places and people in Kingston are shown. Ky-Mani raps in front of soldier line of men. A memorial mural of X is shown. Stefflon raps in front of buff, shirtless men and beside a horse. Sikka Rhymes raps while people dance at a party. The video ends with people gathered around the memorial mural. Sikka Rhymes filled in for Vybz's part in the music video because Vybz is spending life in prison. It was shot in Kingston, Jamaica. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2019 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Dancehall songs Category:Hip hop songs",
