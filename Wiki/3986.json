 "text": "The jungle is a place in a rainforest where the forest floor is covered with plants. Like other rainy places, they have many rivers or streams. Scientists think that more types of animals and plants live in the jungles than everywhere else. When people talk about jungles, they sometimes mean the whole rainforest. The crowding in a jungle leaves little room to walk. This may make it dangerous to people. However, it also has benefits. The many plants and animals can provide food for foraging. The Amazon rainforest is thick and dark jungle in many places in nine countries. However, most of this forest is in Brazil, South America. Some snakes in the Amazon are very dangerous. The jungle is home to a variety of venomous and large constrictor snakes that can pose a threat to humans and other animals. In the Amazon jungle, snakes have plenty of food options due to the rich and diverse environment. Some large Snakes like the Green Anaconda eat animals such as rodents, monkeys, and even larger mammals like deer. They also feed on birds, their eggs, frogs, fish, lizards and some other small snakes. == References == Category:Forests Category:Biomes",
