 "text": "George Ryoichi Ariyoshi (有吉良一; born March 12, 1926) is an American politician. He served as the third Governor of Hawaii from 1974 to 1986. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He became governor when John A. Burns was stepped down. ==Early life== Ariyoshi was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. His parents were Japanese immigrants. He studied at the University of Michigan. He served in the United States Army during World War II. ==Governor of Hawaii (1974-1986)== When he was elected, Ariyoshi became the first American of Asian descent to be elected governor of a state of the United States. Ariyoshi's administration was marked by fiscal conservatism as the post-statehood economic boom came to an end. He guided the state through its first economic recession. He has gathered some criticism for having only people with Japanese surnames on his staff, many were relatives. He also holds the record as the longest-serving state governor in Hawaii, a record likely to remain unbroken because of term limits enacted after his tenure. Ariyoshi is now considered an elder statesman of the Democratic Party of Hawaii. ==Personal life== Ariyoshi married Jean Miya Hayashi in 1955. They have a daughter, Lynn, born in 1957; and two sons, Ryozo, born in 1959, and Donn, 1961. ==References== ==Other websites== * Honolulu Star Bulletin Article about Ariyoshi's Wife and her book, Washington Place: A First Lady's Story * Honolulu Star Bulletin Editorial Column * http://www.weekender.co.jp/LatestEdition/010713/baby.html * Donn Ariyoshi * George Ariyoshi Tribute Site * Portrait of Ariyoshi by Margaret Holland Sargent Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of Hawaii Category:Politicians from Honolulu Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Lieutenant Governors of Hawaii Category:Lawyers from Hawaii",
