He was treated badly and was asked to sign a document which says that he had hidden dynamite in the synagogue to be used for sabotage. Because he refused to sign this document, he and his son Samuel were tied to a cart loaded with stolen goods and driven with a gun pointed at them, while being beaten up. All the synagogues in the city were robbed of their valuables. == Other websites == * Kimpolung-Bukovina Jewish Community Category:Municipalities of Romania Category:Cities in Suceava County",
