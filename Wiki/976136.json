 "text": "TRAPPIST-1g, also known as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 g and K2-112 g, is an exoplanet orbiting around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. TRAPPIST-1 is 39 light years away from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. The planet was one of four new exoplanets discovered orbiting the star using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The exoplanet is within the habitable zone of its host star. It was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. TRAPPIST-1g is the second most distant known planet in its system. It is larger than Earth but less dense. This means that it likely has some form of water. == References == Category:Exoplanets Category:TRAPPIST-1",
