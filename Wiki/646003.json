It was one of the largest election days in Mexican history, with most of the nation's states holding state and local elections on the same day, including nine governorships. It has been the most violent campaign Mexico has experienced in recent history, with 130 political figures killed since September 2017. During the election cycle, Andrés Manuel López Obrador was the leading candidate and would eventually win in a landslide victory. Currently, the results are: López Obrador, 53%; Anaya, 23%; Meade, 16%; and Rodríguez Calderón, 5%. This is the first time since the (controversial) 1988 election that a presidential candidate has been elected with an absolute majority (50%+1) of the votes cast. ==Polling== File:Tendencia histórica de la intención de voto.png|Opinion polling of candidates from November 2017 until the election ==Results== Candidate Candidate Party Alliance Votes % Andrés Manuel López Obrador National Regeneration Movement Juntos Haremos Historia 30,113,483 53.19 Ricardo Anaya National Action Party Por México al Frente 12,610,120 22.28 José Antonio Meade Institutional Revolutionary Party Todos por México 9,289,853 16.41 Jaime Rodríguez Calderón Independent None 2,961,732 5.23 Margarita Zavala Independent None 32,743 0.06 Write-in votes Write-in votes Write-in votes 31,982 0.06 Invalid/blank votes Invalid/blank votes Invalid/blank votes Invalid/blank votes 1,571,114 2.78 Total Total Total Total 56,611,027 100 Registered voters/turnout Registered voters/turnout Registered voters/turnout Registered voters/turnout 89,994,039 63.43 Source: INE Source: INE Source: INE Source: INE Source: INE Source: INE ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== *National Electoral Institute (in Spanish) Category:2018 in Mexico Category:July 2018 events Category:Politics of Mexico Category:General elections",
