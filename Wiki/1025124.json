It has webbed skin on all four feet. The skin on the frog's back is light brown or red-brown in color. Some frogs have yellow spots. Some have blue spots. Some have no spots. The sides of the frog's body are yellow in color with black spots. The belly is yellow with orange marks. The webbed skin on the feet is orange-red in color. This frog lives high in the tree branches. It can glide on the air from tree to tree using the webbed skin on its feet. Large groups of frogs come to the ground to lay eggs. They go to pools of water, marshes, and blocked streams. There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings cut down forests where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
