 "text": "A spherical cow is a metaphor that is used when a complex scientific model is made more simple than it really should be. The words \"spherical cow\" came from a joke where a dairy farmer talks to a theoretical physicist about how to get more prices for his milk. The physicist later talks about an answer to the problem at a seminar. The physicist says \"First, we assume a spherical cow...\" Sometimes, a \"spherical horse\" is used instead of a cow. For example, there is a joke about a physicist who says that he can find out who will win a race if it had a \"spherical horse moving through a vacuum\". == References == Category:Humor Category:Cattle Category:Scientific modeling",
