 "text": "Keynote is a presentation software application made by Apple for its Mac OS operating system. ==History== Keynote was a software program that Steve Jobs, the chief executive officer of Apple used for his own presentations only. It was later sold to everyone as Keynote 1.0, competing against other presentation software, especially Microsoft PowerPoint. Unlike PowerPoint, Keynote can use all image types, and the design uses more pictures, making it easier to use. Because Keynote uses Mac OS X's built-in graphics technologies, it can produce slides with many graphics very easily. ==Version history== Version Number Release Date Changes 1.0 January 7, 2003 Initial release. 1.1 June 04, 2003 Various enhancements to improve functionality and compatibility. 1.1.1 October 28, 2003 Improved stability and several user experience enhancements. 2.0 January 11, 2005 Released as part of the new iWork 05 package.
