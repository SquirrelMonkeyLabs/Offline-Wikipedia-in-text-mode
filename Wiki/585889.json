 "text": "A sexbot is a robot that could be used for sexual intercourse. Sexbots do not exist yet, but they may exist in the future. It could be useful for people who are disabled or extremely shy. It has been predicted by some sociologists that sexbots will be used by TFLers (True Forced Loners) and people suffering from inceldom.Torjesen, Ingrid. \"Society must consider risks of sex robots, report warns.\" BMJ: British Medical Journal 358 (2017). Some analysts say that sexbots exist because young men outnumber young women in the dating scene.Malinowska, Ania. \"Sexbots and Posthuman Love.\" The International Encyclopedia of Gender, Media, and Communication (2020): 1-6. == References == Category:Sex toys",
