They are known for their support of former President Donald Trump. Both were commentators for the conservative news channel Newsmax. They became popular during the 2016 presidential campaign of Trump and again in April 2018 when Facebook said that their posts were \"unsafe to the community\". In April 2020, the two were fired from Fox News for questioning COVID-19 data. On January 8, 2023, Diamond died at her home in North Carolina at the age of 51.
