Diamond is known for his analysis of U.S. Social Security policy and his work as an advisor to the Advisory Council on Social Security in the late 1980s and 1990s. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2010, along with Dale T. Mortensen and Christopher A. Pissarides. He won the Prize for studying what happens when trading in markets is difficult. For example, because buyers and sellers need to find another before they can trade. He is an Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On June 6, 2011 he withdrew his nomination to serve on the Federal Reserveâ€™s board of governors, citing intractable Republican opposition for 14 months.Nobel Laureate Diamond Withdraws Nomination to Fed Board , Joshua Zumbrun, Bloomberg News, June 6, 2011 ==References== ==Other websites== * * Peter A.
