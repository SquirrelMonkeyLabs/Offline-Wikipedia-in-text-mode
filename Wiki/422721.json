 "text": "Marrella splendens is an arthropod known from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia. It is the most common animal in the Burgess Shale. ==History== Marrella was the first fossil collected by Charles Doolittle Walcott from the Burgess Shale, in 1909. Also . Walcott described Marrella informally as a \"lace crab\" and described it more formally as an odd trilobite. In 1971, Whittington did a thorough redescription of the animal. On the basis of its legs, gills and head appendages, he decided that it was not a trilobite, nor a chelicerate, nor a crustacean. Marrella-like organisms are found in other Cambrian deposits. They are known from sediments as late as the Devonian. == References == Category:Arthropods Category:Cambrian Category:Fossils",
