 "text": "\"Disease\" is a song by American singer Lady Gaga. It was released on October 25, 2024, as the lead single from her eighth studio album, Mayhem (2025). The song speaks of curing a lover through sickness. Its title was revealed when Spotify changed the casing of several Gaga tracks to spell \"disease\" in lowercase. The cover art features Gaga sprawled on a white car in a parking spot marked \"DISEASE\". Gaga wrote the song with its producers, Cirkut and Watt, and her fianc√©, Michael Polansky. It is a dance-pop, electropop, EDM, and dark pop song. The song was received well by critics, reminding people of the music from her second studio album, Born This Way (2011). The Guardian called the song synthpop and a reminder of \"the Gaga of old,\" while Slant called it EDM and a \"return to the singer's heyday.\" == References == Category:Electropop songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Electronic dance music songs Category:Lady Gaga songs Category:2024 songs",
