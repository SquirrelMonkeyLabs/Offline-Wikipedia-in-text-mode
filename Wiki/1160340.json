Some people live in the Amazon rainforest in the reserve, but they do not build big roads or big towns. Instead, the people who live in the park grow manioc on farms, raise animals, fish, hunt, and eat wild plants. ==Location== The Baixo Juruá Extractive Reserve has two towns in it: Uarini (38.33%) and Juruá (61.67%) in Amazonas. It is in size. The reserve is about away from Manaus by boat. The reserve is mostly in the place between the Juruá and the Uarini rivers that can flood. Juruá is west of the reserve, the Andirá River to the south, the Copacá River, a tributary of the Uarini, on the east and the Arapapá stream, a tributary of the Juruá, to the north. The Juruá and Uarini rivers go north from the reserve, passing on either side of the Kumaru do Lago Ualá Indigenous Territory, to join the Solimões River. The south of the reserve adjoins the Tefé National Forest. ==History== The government of Brazil made the Baixo Juruá Extractive Reserve on 1 August 2001. They made the reserve to make sure people would use the resources in the reserve in a way that would last a long time and to make sure the people living in the reserve could keep their culture. It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002. The reserve is managed by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. The deliberative council was created on 4 November 2008. The participative management plan was approved on 16 November 2009. As of 2016, the reserve was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. ==Environment== The reserve is above sea level. The park is between with an average of . Annual rainfall is . The soils is not good for growing plants by itself. When the Juruá River floods, good chemicals come in the water. The reserve is almost all tropical forest, with only about 0.6% cleared for fields by the people who live there. Forests coverage includes flooded forests and forests that do not flood. Many fish swim in the rivers and streams. ==Economy== Many groups of people live in the reserve. Some of the groups stay by themselves and do old traditions from before Europeans found South America. Other groups of people mix and talk to outsiders often. Most of the groups are next to the Juruá or to streams or lakes. The food that people eat the most is manioc flour. People hunt and catch wild animals and look for wild fruit and other plants to have different things to eat. Many people also keep chickens, ducks, pigs and cattle. There are some places where people have caught too many fish and turtles. IBAMA/Tefé cannot provide enough professional workers to fix these problems. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:National parks in Brazil Category:Amazonas (Brazil)",
