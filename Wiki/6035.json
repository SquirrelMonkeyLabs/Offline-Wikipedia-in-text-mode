Anyone who creates something original is an author. These could be written items such as books, stories, or poems. This could also be other types of art, such as sculpture or music. Any type of work can be made by an author. == Writer and author == The term author is commonly used to refer to a person who writes as a profession. It is also believed by many that the term is used for writers who are distinguished and who have had their works published. These explanations are common with people who work with those who write professionally. An author does not always have to be a writer.
