Three of his paintings are in Derby Museum and Art Gallery. ==Biography== Clark was born in Derby and after studying art he started work at Royal Crown Derby. He won many prizes for his art. In his forties he served in the Royal Field Artillery during the first world war. His only book was a guide for his students to design based on plant forms. In the book he supplied the designs. Clark said \"... it cannot be too frequently urged upon students that the only right way for them is to make their own studies direct from nature.\" Three of his paintings are in Derby Museum and Art Gallery after being gifted by Alfred E. Goodey. The painting of Green Street records a time three years before the Hippodrome Theatre was built on the left and on the right is the College of Art where Clark trained.
