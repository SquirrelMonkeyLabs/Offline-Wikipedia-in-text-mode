The winner was decided by two votes: one from a group of musical experts from each country and one from the viewers of each participating country. The vote rankings were combined and the winner was declared. During the performance of the United Kingdom's song, a protestor jumped on stage and stole the microphone off singer SuRie. Security guards removed the protestor from the stage shortly after and the show cut to an interview with Ukrainian contestant Mélovin in the lounge area. SuRie decided not to perform the song again.
