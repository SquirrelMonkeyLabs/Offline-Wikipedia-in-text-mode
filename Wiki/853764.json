 "text": "On July 4, 2021, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) crashed after an attempted landing at Jolo Airport in Sulu, Philippines. With 53 deaths, of which 50 people were on the aircraft and 3 on the ground, the incident is the deadliest aviation accident in Philippine military history. The C-130 military plane was transporting troops from Cagayan de Oro, in Mindanao, to Sulu province when it missed the runway on the island of Jolo. The plane had attempted to land at Jolo airport, but overshot the runway without touching down. It failed to regain enough power and height and crashed at nearby Patikul village at 11:30 a.m. local time. The Lockheed Martin C-130 aircraft had recently arrived in the Philippines. It was one of two aircraft granted by the US government's military financing program. The plane was considered to be in good condition. It had 11,000 flying hours left before it was due for maintenance. ==References== Category:2021 disasters in Asia 2021 Air Force C-130 crash Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2021 Category:July 2021 events",
