 "text": "The funny rocket frog (Hyloxalus peculiaris) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 26.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 29.0–29.8 mm long. The frog has two marks on its chest and throat. The skin of the frog's belly and throat is brown in color. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in a forest on a mountain 2195 meters above sea level. This is a cloud forest, where between 1000 and 2000 mm of rain or other weather falls every year, and the temperature is between 18 and 24°C. Scientists saw this frog in a protected park: Parque Nacional Rio Negro Sopladora. ==Young== Scientists are not sure how the frog makes its young,but they think the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists caught and looked at four adult frogs in 1962, but they have not seen more of them since then. Scientists think the frogs could all be dead now. If they are not all dead, then only 250 or fewer are alive today, all living in the same place. Human beings keep changing that place by cutting down trees to make farms and get wood to build with. Because of this, scientists say the frog is critically endangered, or in very big danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
