The New York Times called him an up-and-comer in the rap world. \"A 17-year-old Swedish kid can rack up millions of YouTube views and SoundCloud plays without making so much as a ripple in the mainstream hip-hop world.\" He seems to have made more than a ripple. Håstad was born in Belarus. At age 3 he moved to Sweden. At first he only spoke Russian. He learned Swedish and performs in English. ==References== Category:Swedish musicians Category:Rappers Category:Swedish record producers Category:Musicians from Stockholm Category:Singers from Stockholm Category:Living people Category:1996 births",
