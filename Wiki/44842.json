They are the product of ancient volcanic activity and are separated from the Vogelsberg Mountains by the Fulda River and its valley. These mountains are a popular tourist attraction. Hikers come for the nearly 6,000 km (3,750 miles) of tracks through the picturesque scenery, and gliding has been done here since the early Twentieth century. Nowadays people come here to stay on a farm during holidays, too. Since 1991, UNESCO has declared the Rhön a Biosphere Reserve.
