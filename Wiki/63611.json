Before World War II, Lemkin was interested in the Armenian Genocide and campaigned in the League of Nations to ban what he called \"barbarity\" and \"vandalism\". He is best known for his work against genocide, a word he coined in 1943 from the root words genos (Greek for family, tribe or race) and -cide (Latin for killing). ==Death== Lemkin died of a heart attack at the public relations office of Milton H. Blow in New York City in 1959, at the age of 59. ==Other websites== *Biographical sketch of Raphael Lemkin *Key writings of Raphael Lemkin on Genocide, 1933–1947 *Raphael Lemkin at ArmeniaPedia Category:1900 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Belarusian Jews Category:Genocides in Europe Category:Polish lawyers Category:Polish Jews Category:Refugees from Nazism Category:Jewish lawyers",
