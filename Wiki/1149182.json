 "text": "The Martin B-10 was a bomber aircraft used by the United States Army Air Corps. It first flew in 1932 and was introduced in 1934. The B-10 was the first mass-produced all-metal monoplane (aircraft with a single pair of wings). It was replaced by the B-18 Bolo and B-17 Flying Fortress. A notable event with the B-10 was when Lt. Col. Henry H. Arnold lead a flight of 10 B-10 bombers from Washington on a six-day to the Arctic, which proved the B-10's capabilities and claimed land for the United States. == References == Category:United States Army aircraft",
