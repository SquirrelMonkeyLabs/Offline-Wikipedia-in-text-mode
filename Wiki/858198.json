 "text": "The 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 76th time the midseason baseball game between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL) (the two leagues that contained Major League Baseball) played. The game took place on July 12, 2005 at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan, where the Detroit Tigers, one of the teams competing, was located. The game would end with the American League defeating the National League 7â€“5, and giving an AL team (it would later be decided for it to be the Chicago White Sox) the prize of the ability to play at their home field in the 2005 World Series. The Detroit Symphony Orchestra played the British national anthem before the game celebrations, as to show that they were also sad about the 7 July 2005 London bombings.
