During low tide period, the Chhera island can be reached by walking for about two and a half hours from St. Martin's Island. The most popular way of getting there is by motorboat. Corals can be found all over the island. It has one small green area where bushes grow. No permanent settlement exists except for tourists. ==References== Category:Geography of Bangladesh Category:Islands of Asia",
