 "text": "Tostilocos (also Dorilocos) are a popular Mexican antojito (street food) that consist of Tostitos or Doritos tortilla chips with various toppings. Ingredients can include white corn, cueritos (pickled pork rinds), cucumber, jícama, lime juice, Clamato, mango pieces, hot sauce, chamoy, chili powder, salt, mayonnaise, and Japanese-style peanuts (sometimes referred to as \"cracker nuts\"). The dish was first conceived in the late 1990s by street vendors in Mexico. In the 21st century, Tostilocos also known as “Tostitos Preparados” are now commonly sold by street vendors, stadium vendors, and at Mexican juice bars in both Mexico and the Southwestern United States.
