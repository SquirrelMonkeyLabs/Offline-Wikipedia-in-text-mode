 "text": "Role-playing is changing one's behaviour to assume a role. This can be deliberately to act out an adopted role, or unconsciously to fill a social role. The Oxford English Dictionary defines role-playing as \"the changing of one's behaviour to fulfill a social role\". However, in the field of social psychology, the term is used more loosely: * To refer to the playing of roles generally, such as in a theatre or educational setting; * To refer to taking a role of a character or person and acting it out with a partner taking someone else's role; * To refer to a wide range of games including role-playing video game (RPG), play-by-mail games and more; * To refer specifically to role- playing games. == References == Category:Branches of psychology Category:Games",
