It is thought to be the remains of a huge meteorite strike.Connelly D.

The crater is about 600 km (370 mi) in diameter.Connelly D. (2009b) Age dating MAPCIS (Massive Australian Precambrian/Cambrian Impact Structure) a multi- modal indirect approach Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs. 41(7):418 There is a wider ring 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) in diameter which may be related to the impact. If it is confirmed, MAPCIS would be the largest impact structure on Earth. It is not confirmed at present. The age of this hypothetical impact is about 545 mya. This puts it just before the Cambrian period. == References == Category:Impact craters Category:Geography of Australia",
