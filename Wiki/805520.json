 "text": "OnlyFans is a website for posting videos and pictures online. It is used for making money or for buying those things. The website is British. It is based in London. People who create videos or other things on the site can earn money from users who subscribe to their content. These people who subscribe and pay money to see what people make are known as the \"fans\". The company charges a 20% fee for all transactions made on the site. It is popular with people who sell sexual videos or images but also has other types of videos and images. For example sports experts, musicians and other people who make things who post regularly online. The people who post things can get money directly from their fans on a monthly basis as well as from one time payments called \"tips\" from video views. Famous people with OnlyFans accounts include Cardi B, Tyga, Blac Chyna, Bella Thorne and more. OnlyFans has been criticised for hosting hurtful material including sexual videos of children. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation reports fewer numbers of hurtful sexual videos of children than are posted to Facebook, which is a site with more people using it. Facebook having more people on it and more hurtful videos is talked about to show that the problem of hurtful videos is not just on OnlyFans but on many websites online. A campaign to investigate OnlyFans began in the US Congress in August 2021. People disagree about how safe it is to be someone who makes things and posts them on OnlyFans. People who make and post things have been stalked and hurt by fans, sometimes resulting in the leaking of the person's private information. In July 2020, Sky News in the United Kingdom reported that OnlyFans had not paid a UK tax called the \"value-added tax\" for three years before the news story, and could face paying the taxes and extra as punishment by the UK government. == References == Category:Video sharing websites Category:Companies based in London Category:British websites Category:2016 establishments in Europe Category:2010s establishments in the United Kingdom",
