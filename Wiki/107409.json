Malfoy is an antagonist, a Slytherin student in Harry Potter's year and Harry's main rival in school. In the Harry Potter movies, he is played by Tom Felton. ==Appearance== The fictional Draco Malfoy is described as having a pale, pointed face, sleek white-blond hair and light icy gray eyes that seem cold. ==Character== Draco Malfoy is depicted as a manipulative villain, exhibiting cunning use of magic and an ambitious attitude to get what he wants in the stories. ==Family== Draco Malfoy is the only child of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, a member of the Black family, whose cousin is Harry Potter's godfather. Draco’s family was “one of the first to come back to the good side after the Wizarding War ended and Voldemort was defeated.” In a stage play towards the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, Malfoy married Astoria Greengrass, a fellow housemate and had an only child, Scorpius Malfoy, who is identical to Draco. Astoria later died from blood malediction in 2017, which leaves Draco devastated. ==Story== Draco Malfoy's father taught Draco Malfoy to bully Harry and his friends Ron, Hermione and Neville Longbottom. In the second book, he mocks Hermione by calling her \"Mudblood\", insulting her for her Muggle origins. In the sixth book of the Harry Potter series, Draco becomes a Death Eater, thinking it will make his father proud. But, he realizes his mistake and when asked by Voldemort to murder Professor Dumbledore, he is unable to do so. Severus Snape commits the murder after he took the unbreakable vow to protect Malfoy. With Dumbledore's death, Malfoy becomes the master of the powerful Elder Wand. He disarms Dumbledore and he is later disarmed by Harry Potter.
