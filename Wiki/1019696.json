 "text": "Romerus is a small genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. They live in southern China (Hong Kong, Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong). Some of the species in Romerus were in Philautus. Scientists think Romerus might be the most basal genus in Rhacophorinae. At first, scientists named this genus Liuixalus in 2008. They looked at the DNA and saw these frogs were different from the frogs in Chiromantis. Scientists named the group Liuixalus after , a Chinese amphibian scientist. In 2021, scientists looked at the DNA again and decided Romerus would be a better name. The name Romerus is for British amphibian scientist John D. Romer. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says two of these frog species are vulnerable (Romerus ocellatus and R. hainanus), one as endangered (R. romeri), and one as least-concern (R. feii). They do not know enough about Romerus shiwandashan to give it a rank. ==Species== There are six species in the genus Romerus: * Romerus calcarius (Milto, Poyarkov, Orlov, and Nguyen, 2013) * Romerus feii Yang, Rao, and Wang, 2015 * Romerus hainanus (Liu and Wu, 2004) * Romerus ocellatus (Liu and Hu, 1973) * Romerus romeri (Smith, 1953) * Romerus shiwandashan (Li, Mo, Jiang, Xie, and Jiang, 2015) ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
