 "text": "Ludvig Dmitrievich Faddeev (also Ludwig Dmitriyevich; ) (23 March 1934 – 26 February 2017) was a Soviet and Russian theoretical physicist and mathematician. He discovered of the Faddeev equations in the theory of the quantum mechanical three-body problem and for the development of path integral methods. Faddeev was born in Leningrad. He studied at Saint Petersburg State University. Faddeev led the Leningrad School, in which he along with many of his students developed the quantum inverse scattering method for studying quantum integrable systems in one space and one time dimension. This work led to the invention of quantum groups by Drinfeld and Jimbo. From 1976 to 2000, Faddeev was head of the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences (PDMI RAS). He was elected a member of the Academia Europaea in 1989. Faddeev died on 26 February 2017 in St. Petersburg, Russia at the age of 82.Академик Людвиг Фаддеев ушел из жизни на 83-м году жизни ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Russian academics Category:Scientists from Saint Petersburg Category:Russian mathematicians Category:Russian theoretical physicists Category:Members of Academia Europaea",
