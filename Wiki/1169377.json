It is one of the main streets in Downtown Vancouver. In Vancouver, part of Knight Street also turns into Clark Drive and goes towards the Port of Vancouver. It is the busiest trucking road in the city of Vancouver. In Richmond, part of Highway 91 is also on Knight Street. The street was originally named Knight Road before it was changed to Knight Street. Knight Street is named after South Vancouver property owner Robert Knight, and Clark Drive was named after realtor Ephraim James Clark. The Knight Street Bridge is connected to Knight Street. It was officially opened on January 15, 1974. It runs over the north arm of the Fraser River, connecting Richmond and Vancouver. One of the points of interest on Clark Drive is the East Van Cross, located on Clark and East 6th Avenue. It has become a symbol for the city and was seen in graffiti around the city for decades beforehand. In 2010, artist Ken Lam installed the neon sign under the name Monument for East Vancouver in 2010 for the Winter Olympics. ==Gallery== Image:Monument for East Vancouver.JPG|Monument for East Vancouver ==References== Category:Freeways in British Columbia Category:Streets in Vancouver",
