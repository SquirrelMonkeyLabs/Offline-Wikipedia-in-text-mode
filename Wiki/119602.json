 "text": "Super Bowl XXXIV (or Super Bowl 34) was a Super Bowl game between the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans in the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 regular season. The Rams won against the Titans 23–16. The game was played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. It is best remembered for the final play of the game, where Mike Jones of St Louis tackled Kevin Dyson of Tennessee at the one yard line as time ran out, thus stopping Tennessee from scoring a touchdown that could have tied the game. ==The game== Both teams did not play well early on in the game. St. Louis went inside the \"Red zone\" (the final 20 yards) of Tennessee's half six times in the first half, but only scored four times - three field goals, and one touchdown. They missed one field goal try, and had to abort another due to a bad snap. Tennessee also missed a field goal in the fist half. This gave St Louis a 16-0 lead at half time. In the second half, Tennessee fought back, with two Touchdowns - but only scored the extra point on one of them, and then tied the game with a field goal. St. Louis then scored in just one play to take the lead again, 23-16, with fewer than two minutes left. With only one time-out remaining, Tennessee tried to drive into the End zone to score a touchdown that could have tied the game if they made the extra point. However, after using their time-out with just six seconds left, the final play had Kevin Dyson tackled at the one yard line. The time ran out, and St. Louis won the game. ==Most Valuable Player (MVP)== St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP). == Team statistics == St. Louis Rams Tennessee Titans First downs 23 27 Third down efficiency 5/12 6/13 Fourth down efficiency 0-1 1-1 Total yards 436 367 Passing yards 407 208 Passing – Completions-attempts 24-45 22-36 Rushing yards 29 159 Rushing attempts 13 36 Yards per rush 2.2 4.4 Penalties-yards 8-60 7-45 Sacks-against 1-7 1-6 Turnovers 0 0 Fumbles-lost 2-0 0-0 Interceptions thrown 0 0 Time of possession 23:34 36:26 == Player statistics== Rams Passing C/ATT* Yds TD INT Kurt Warner 24/45 414 2 0 Rams Rushing Cara Yds TD LGb Marshall Faulk 10 17 0 4 Rams Receiving Recc Yds TD LGb Torry Holt 7 109 1 32 Isaac Bruce 6 162 1 73 Marshall Faulk 5 90 0 52 Titans Passing C/ATT* Yds TD INT Steve McNair 22/36 214 0 0 Titans Rushing Cara Yds TD LGb Eddie George 28 95 2 13 Titans Receiving Recc Yds TD LGb Jackie Harris 7 64 0 21 Frank Wycheck 5 35 0 13 Kevin Dyson 4 41 0 16 *Completions/Attempts aCarries bLong play cReceptions == Starting players == St. Louis Position Tennessee OFFENSE Torry Holt WR Kevin Dyson Orlando Pace LT Brad Hopkins Tom Nütten LG Bruce Matthews Mike Gruttadauria C Kevin Long Adam Timmerman RG Benji Olson Fred Miller RT Jon Runyan Roland Williams TE Frank Wycheck Isaac Bruce WR Isaac Byrd Kurt Warner QB Steve McNair Marshall Faulk RB Eddie George Robert Holcombe FB-TE Jackie Harris DEFENSE Kevin Carter LE Jevon Kearse Ray Agnew LDT Josh Evans D'Marco Farr RDT Jason Fisk Grant Wistrom RE Kenny Holmes Mike Jones LOLB Eddie Robinson London Fletcher MLB Barron Wortham Todd Collins ROLB Joe Bowden Todd Lyght LCB Denard Walker Dexter McCleon RCB Samari Rolle Billy Jenkins SS Blaine Bishop Keith Lyle FS Anthony Dorsett == Game officials == * Referee: Bob McElwee * Umpire: Ron Botchan * Head Linesman: Earnie Frantz * Line Judge: Byron Boston * Field Judge: Al Jury * Side Judge: Tom Fincken * Back Judge: Bill Leavy * Alternate Referee: Walt Coleman * Alternate Umpire: Bob Wagner == Other websites == * Super Bowl XXXIV official website * Large online database of NFL data and statistics *034 Category:Sports in Atlanta Category:2000 in sports Category:St. Louis Rams Category:2000 in the United States Category:2000s in Atlanta, Georgia",
