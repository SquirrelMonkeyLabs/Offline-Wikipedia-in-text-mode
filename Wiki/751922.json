Wilkinson Prize in Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing\" and \"J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software\" given by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. ==Career== He transferred to the National Physical Laboratory in 1946, where he worked with Alan Turing. Later, Wilkinson's interests took him into numerical analysis, where he discovered many great algorithms. ==Selected works== * (REAP) * (AEP) * with Christian Reinsch: Handbook for Automatic Computation, Volume II, Linear Algebra, Springer- Verlag, 1971. * The Perfidious Polynomial.
