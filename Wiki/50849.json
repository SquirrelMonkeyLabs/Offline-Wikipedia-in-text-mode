It is a Star Alliance member. It joined the alliance in 1999. Its main base or hub is Auckland International Airport. ==History== In 1940, TEAL was founded. Its first flights were from Auckland to Sydney and Wellington. Later, flights to Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti and the Cook Islands were added. The Australian government bought 50% of TEAL in 1953. The remaining 50% was owned by the Government of New Zealand. In 1961, the airline became completely owned by the Government of New Zealand. TEAL was officially renamed Air New Zealand on April 1, 1965. The airline bought Douglas DC-8 airplanes in July 1965. These were used for longer routes to Honolulu and Los Angeles. A larger Boeing 747 was bought in 1981. Air New Zealand bought Ansett Australia in 2000. Ansett later went out of business. ==Gallery== File:Air NewZealand-Logo.svg|The old logo used from 1996 until 2012 File:Air New Zealand.svg|The new logo introduced in 2012 File:Air New Zealand check in hall at Auckland Airport June 2012.JPG|Air New Zealand's self-service check-in File:Air New Zealand DC-10 (6961717348).jpg|Air New Zealand had DC-10's from 1973 until 1982 File:Airnz.b747.zk-nbt.arp.jpg|Air New Zealand Boeing 747 File:Air New Zealand Boeing 787-9 landing at Perth Airport.jpg|A new Air New Zealand Boeing 787 File:ZK-OKE (6941444347).jpg|An air New Zealand 777,its second lagest plane. ==Destinations== Air New Zealand serves the following destinations: ==References== Category:1965 establishments in Oceania Category:Airlines of Oceania Category:Auckland Category:Star Alliance Category:Transport in New Zealand Category:1960s establishments in New Zealand Category:IATA members Category:Companies of New Zealand",
