 "text": "The Heaviside function, often written as H(x), is a non-continuous function whose value is zero for a negative input and one for a positive input. The function is used in the mathematics of control theory to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time, and which stays switched on indefinitely. It was named after the Englishman Oliver Heaviside. The Heaviside function is the integral of the Dirac delta function: H′(x) = δ(x). This is sometimes written as : H(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x { \\delta(t)} \\mathrm{d}t == Discrete form == We can also define an alternative form of the Heaviside step function as a function of a discrete variable n: :H[n]=\\begin{cases} 0, & n < 0 \\\\\\ 1, & n \\ge 0 \\end{cases} where n is an integer. Or :H(x) = \\lim_{z \\rightarrow x^-} ((|z| / z + 1) / 2) The discrete- time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step : \\delta\\left[ n \\right] = H[n] - H[n-1]. This function is the cumulative summation of the Kronecker delta: : H[n] = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} \\delta[k] \\, where : \\delta[k] = \\delta_{k,0} \\, is the discrete unit impulse function. == Representations == Often an integral representation of the Heaviside step function is useful: :H(x)=\\lim_{ \\epsilon \\to 0^+} -{1\\over 2\\pi \\mathrm{i}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty {1 \\over \\tau+\\mathrm{i}\\epsilon} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i} x \\tau} \\mathrm{d}\\tau =\\lim_{ \\epsilon \\to 0^+} {1\\over 2\\pi \\mathrm{i}}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty {1 \\over \\tau-\\mathrm{i}\\epsilon} \\mathrm{e}^{\\mathrm{i} x \\tau} \\mathrm{d}\\tau. == H(0) == The value of the function at 0 can be defined as H(0) = 0, H(0) = ½ or H(0) = 1. In particular: : H(x) = \\frac{1+\\sgn(x)}{2} = \\begin{cases} 0, & x < 0 \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}, & x = 0 \\\\\\ 1, & x > 0. \\end{cases} ==Related pages== * Laplace transform * Step function == References == Category:Mathematics",
