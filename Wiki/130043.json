 "text": "Since the beginning of the Premier League, 58 football stadiums have been used to host matches, with one more stadium set to host its first match in the 2016–17 season. The first round of Premier League matches took place on 15 August 1992. 11 clubs hosted the opening fixtures. Following the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989, the Taylor Report suggested the removal of standing terraces by the start of the 1994–95 season. They were replaced by all-seater stadiums. When Fulham came up from Division 1 in the 2000–2001 season, terraces returned for a short while. This gave them more time to complete the changes. For a bit of time they had to play at Loftus Road after not enough progress was made in converting Craven Cottage. They returned to their home ground after building work was completed in time for the 2004–05 season. Burnley's Turf Moor stadium became the 50th Premier League stadium on 19 August 2009, where they faced Manchester United. Bournemouth's Dean Court is the most recent stadium to host a Premier League match, when they played their first ever home Premier League match against Aston Villa on 8 August 2015. The next stadium to host its first Premier League match will be London Stadium, new home to West Ham United, when West Ham hosts Bournemouth on 21 August 2016. ==Stadiums== Stadiums listed in bold mean they are the home grounds of teams currently in the 2017–18 Premier League season.
