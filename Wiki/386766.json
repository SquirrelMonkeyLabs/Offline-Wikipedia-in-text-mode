 "text": "In the United States of America a sportsbook is a place where a player can bet money on many different sports, for example basketball, golf, football, hockey, baseball, soccer, horse racing, boxing and many more. A bet is when a person thinks that a particular team/contestant will win a competition and gives some money. If he wins the bet - he will receive his money back with some monetary prize. If his team/contestant loses, he will not get his money back. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 allows only Nevada, Oregon, Montana, and Delaware to legally bet on sports. There are more Sportbooks that allow betting online or through mobile. With better availability and lower minimum bets, the whole industry is rapidly growing.http://www.bangthebook.com/sportsbook-review/ Comparison and explanation of Sportsbook services Before placing a bet a person should read the terms and conditions of the sportsbook to avoid any problems. ==References== Category:Gambling Category:Sports",
