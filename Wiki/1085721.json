In an inclusive society, it does not matter where you come from, who you love or whether you have an illness or disability. However, an inclusive society does not arise by itself. This primarily depends on the reforms carried out by the elected government structures. But, there are still closed governments that suppress human rights and freedoms in order to maintain their long-term power.
