 "text": "Continental philosophers are a group of philosophers mainly from continental Europe (especially France and Germany). Continental philosophy includes philosophical movements from the 19th century and after. The term became popular among researchers in England after World War II. It is often used to separate from analytic philosophy. Being a philosopher from continental Europe is not quite the same as being a continental philosopher. Some continental philosophers are from other parts of the world. There are many movements within continental philosophy, such as: critical theory, deconstruction, existentialism, German idealism, Hegelianism, Marxism, Nietzscheanism, phenomenology, postmodernism, and others. == References == * * *",
