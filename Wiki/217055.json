 "text": "Ewha Girls' High School was the first school for girls in Korea, and was called Ewha Hackdang at first. It is located in Jeong-dong, Jungu, Seoul, Korea. It was founded by Mary Scranton who came to Korea as a Christian missionary in 1885. This school opened in 1886 as a mission school, and the name \"Ewha\" was granted by Gojong, the 26th king of the Joseon dynasty. It literally means pear blossoms, but the internal meaning is \"Be white, clear, innocent like pear blossoms\". Ewha Girls' High School is one of the first private schools that are allowed to have autonomy, since 2010. == Great women in history from Ewha == ===Yu Kwan Soon=== The most famous person who has graduated from this high school is Yu Kwan Soon. She was one of the leaders of a great independence movement called the \"3.1 movement\" while she was in school. At that time, Korea was under the domination of Japan, and the school had to close. Even though she was a young girl student, she resisted with great courage, and died in prison. Later, people praised her bravery, and she got the Order of Merit for National Foundation for effort on independence in 1962, and the Honor Ewha Girls' High School diploma in 1996. ===Lee Hui Ho=== The wife of Kim Dae Jung, the 15th president of Korea. She was the manager of Young Women's Christian Association of Korea. She was also the director of Korean National Council of Women. == Facilities == They have the eight-story main hall, EWHA 100th Memorial Hall, and library building which was donated from Jeon In Hang. There are also a gymnasium, which is one of the largest in Korea, several tennis courts, and a huge play ground. A simson hall, the oldest building at Ewha Girls' High School, is registered as culture remains. The open-air theater, Yu Kwan soon memorial building, and Ewha church are famous.
