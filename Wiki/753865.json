 "text": "In a tax system, the tax rate is the ratio (usually expressed as a percentage) at which a business or person is taxed. There are several methods used to present a tax rate: statutory, average, marginal, and effective. These rates can also be presented using different definitions applied to a tax base: inclusive and exclusive. ==Types== * A statutory tax rate is the legally given rate. An income tax could have multiple rates for different income levels, where a sales tax may have a flat rate. * An average tax rate is the ratio of the total amount of taxes paid to the total tax base given in a percentage. * A marginal tax rate is the tax rate on income set at a higher rate for incomes above a designated higher bracket. ==References== Category:Economic policy Category:Taxation",
