It began in 1987. It has continued to grow in both scope and size every year. South by Southwest is run by the company SXSW, Inc. ==Overview== === SXSW Music === SXSW Music is the largest music festival in the world. It had more than 2,000 performances in 2014. In 1987, 700 people attended the music event. In 2009, there were over 32,000 registrants. Bands must pay for their own travel and lodging at the event. All performers get a cash payment ($100 for solo musicians or $250 for bands) or a wristband that gives them access to all music events. === SXSW Film === ====Conference==== SXSW Film Conference lasts for five days. There are speakers, workshops, mentor sessions and more, with expert filmmakers and industry leaders. In 2015, there were over 250 sessions with 735 speakers.

Past movies that premiered at SXSW include Furious 7, Neighbors, Chef, 21 Jump Street, The Cabin in the Woods, Bridesmaids and Insidious, and the TV series Girls, Silicon Valley and Penny Dreadful. Although the film festival often shows independently produced movies, studios have often shown their comedies there before they are released. They do this to get an idea of how popular the movie will be in theaters. === SXSW Interactive === SXSW Interactive is about new technology. The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator. According to a festival organizer Louis Black, SXSW Interactive \"has probably been the biggest of its kind in the world\" since 2007., Alex Geiser, The Daily Texan, March 18, 2010 ==References== ==Other websites== * * The Best of America â€“ South By Southwest Interactive, CounterPunch, March 14, 2014 Category:Festivals in the United States Category:Austin, Texas Category:1987 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Texas",
