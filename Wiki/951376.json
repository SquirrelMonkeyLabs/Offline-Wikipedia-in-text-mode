At that time, it was a farm. Newton returned here in 1666 when Cambridge University closed. It was here, where he performed many of his most famous experiments, such as his work on light and optics. This is also said to be the site where Newton was inspired to create his law of universal gravitation. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Lincolnshire",
