 "text": "Beddome's bush frog or Beddomme's bubble-nest frog (Raorchestes beddomii) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat Mountains, between 1200 and 1780 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees and bushes. People have seen it on the lower plants in tropical forests and evergreen forests. It lives in places where the tree branches do not come together like a roof all the way. This frog can live near human beings. The frogs that live in the very southern part of this frog's home have red eyes. Frogs that live further north do not. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it does not live in a large place, people are only changing small parts of that place, and the frog is good at living in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
