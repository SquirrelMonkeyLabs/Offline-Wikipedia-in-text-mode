 "text": "R. Torre & Company, Inc. also known as Torani, is a San Francisco Bay Area flavoring syrup and sauce company, founded in 1925 by husband and wife Rinaldo and Ezilda Torre. In 1925 the Torres immigrated from Lucca, Italy to San Francisco. Mixing flavor with sparkling water in the 1920s, they introduced Italian soda to local cafes, and soon began selling Torani Syrups. Torani's first flavors were Anisette, Grenadine, Lemon, Orgeat or Almond, and Tamarindo. In 1933, when the Prohibition ended, Ezilda Torre became one of the first rectifiers of distilled spirits in the US. Torani sold products like California Vermouth throughout the Great Depression and World War II. Torani is credited with creating the world's first flavored latte in 1982, combining flavor with espresso and steamed milk. Category:Brands",
