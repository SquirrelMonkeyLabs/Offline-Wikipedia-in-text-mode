The District of Alto Adige included some municipalities of today's province of Verona. The \"Department of Benaco\", which was created in 1797 and included some territories of actual Province of Trento and Province of Verona, was disbanded in 1798 and with it the District of Alto Adige after a structural reorganization of the Napoleon's first Italian republic. The Alto Adige name was used again by the French in 1810, a few kilometres to the north of the disappeared District of Alto Adige on the upper course of the river Adige, when was created the Department of Alto Adige. ==Related pages== * Department of Alto Adige * Alto Adige ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Reinhard Stauber.
