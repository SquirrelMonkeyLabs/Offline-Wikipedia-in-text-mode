 "text": "The Dom (Arabic: دومي) are a people with origins in the Indian Subcontinent, which through ancient migrations dispersed to the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, Turkey and still other parts of the Indian subcontinent. They speak Domari, an endangered Indo-Aryan language. They have been associated with another traditionally itinerant group of Indo-Aryans called differently, the Roma people and Lom people: the three groups are said to have separated from each other or, at least, share a similar history. In particular, both the Dom, Lom and Roma ancestors left the subcontinent of northern India between the 6th and 11th centuries ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Asia",
