 "text": "Kill 'Em All is the first album by Metallica, an American thrash metal band. It was released on July 25, 1983. It has sold over three million copies in the United States. When it was released most of the reviews were good. Two singles were released from the album, \"Whiplash\" and \"Jump in the Fire\". The album was going to be called Metal Up Your Ass, however, the record label that released the album did not want this. Cliff Burton, the band's bass guitar player, said \"why don't we just kill 'em all?\" when talking about the record label. The band decided to use \"Kill 'Em All\" as the album's name. ==Track listing== #Hit the Lights #The Four Horsemen #Motorbreath #Jump in the Fire #(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth #Whiplash #Phantom Lord #No Remorse #Seek and Destroy #Metal Militia ==References== Category:Metallica albums Category:1983 albums Category:Debut albums Category:Heavy metal albums",
