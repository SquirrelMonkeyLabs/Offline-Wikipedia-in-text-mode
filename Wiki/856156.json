An adult male goat weighs about 25 to 30 kg and female 20 to 25 kg. It is poor in milk production. It is very popular in Bangladesh because of its low demand for feed and high kid production rate. They are considered as the “National Goat of Bangladesh” respectively. It produces high-quality meat and skin, and is preferred for the skin and high prolificacy rate. This breed plays a very important role in reducing unemployment and poverty from Bangladesh.
