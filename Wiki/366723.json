 "text": "Denmark sent a team for the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, West Germany. They sent ten athletes, eight male and two female. ==Disability classifications== Athletes at the Paralympics in 1972 were all afflicted by spinal cord injuries. They were also required the use of a wheelchair. This is different from later Paralympics that include events for participants that fit into any of five different disability categories; amputation, either congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications. It depends upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters. It describes the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. == References == Category:1972 Summer Paralympics Category:Denmark at the Paralympics Category:1970s in Denmark",
