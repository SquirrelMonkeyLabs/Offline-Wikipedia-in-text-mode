 "text": "The Chicago Seven (originally Chicago Eight, also Conspiracy Eight/Conspiracy Seven) were seven defendants charged by the federal government with conspiracy, causing a riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests that took place in Chicago, Illinois. They were also responsible for the massive violent protest at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. The Chicago Seven were: * Abbie Hoffman * Jerry Rubin * David Dellinger * Tom Hayden * Rennie Davis * John Froines * Lee Weiner Bobby Seale, the eighth man charged, had his trial end during the proceedings, lowering the number of defendants from eight to seven. The trial resulted in five of the seven convicted for creating riots. All were acquitted of conspiracy. However, during the trial, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced all of the defendants to lengthy sentences for Contempt of court. Later, the judge's contempt charges were reversed, and all of the convictions for causing riots were overturned. ==Other websites== * * *Country Joe McDonald's testimony. * (1987 HBO made- for-television movie). *Chicago 10 (2007) at imdb.com * *An excerpt from The Chicago Conspiracy Trial: Revised Edition by John Schultz.
