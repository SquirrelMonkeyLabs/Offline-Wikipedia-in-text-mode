 "text": "Musical artist Johnnie Clyde Johnson (July 8, 1924 â€“ April 13, 2005) was an American pianist. He played jazz, blues and rock and roll. His work with Chuck Berry led to his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for breaking racial barriers in the military. == Career == Johnson began playing the piano in 1928. He joined the United States Marine Corps during World War II. He became a member of Bobby Troup's all- serviceman jazz orchestra, the Barracudas. . Over the next 20 years, the two collaborated on many of Berry's songs, including \"School Days\", \"Roll Over Beethoven\", \"Carol\", and \"Nadine\". The song \"Johnny B. Goode\" was reportedly a tribute to Johnson, with the title referring to Johnson's behavior when he was drinking. Johnson received little recognition until the Chuck Berry concert documentary, Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, was released in 1987. The experience forged a permanent bond between him, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, and Steve Jordan. Although Johnson had been supporting himself as a bus driver in St. Louis, the exposure and experience of the film helped him return to headlining. In 2005, he played piano on Styx's re-recording of \"Blue Collar Man\", entitled \"Blue Collar Man @ 2120\", for their album Big Bang Theory. It was recorded at Chess Studios, on the 46th anniversary of the recording of \"Johnnie B. Goode\" at the same studio. == Death == Johnson died at the age of 80 from a kidney ailment and pneumonia in St. Louis on April 13, 2005. He was buried in the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. == Sources == == Other websites == * Johnnie Johnson.
