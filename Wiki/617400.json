 "text": "Cristatusaurus was a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of West Africa. Its fossils look very similar to the ones from Baryonyx and Suchomimus. == Discovery and naming == The first specimens were found in Niger in 1973 by a French paleontologist named Philippe Taquet. The name of the animal refers to the Latin word for crest, \"crista\", because it had a crest on its snout. The species \"lapparenti\" is named after another French paleontologist called Albert-Félix de Lapparent.Taquet, P. and Russell, D.A. (1998). \"New data on spinosaurid dinosaurs from the Early Cretaceous of the Sahara\". Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences à Paris, Sciences de la Terre et des Planètes 327: 347-353 The fossils discovered so far include two broken snout bones, some pieces from the upper and lower jaws, a claw, and four backbones (also called vertebrae). Scientists aren't sure if Cristatusaurus is a new species, some of them say it could be the same dinosaur as Suchomimus or Baryonyx.Rauhut, O.W.M.
