Mongooses are widely distributed in Asia, Africa the Caribbean, and southern Europe. == In popular culture == A well-known mongoose written in fiction is Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, who has a short story of the same title in The Jungle Book (1894) by Rudyard Kipling. In this story set in India, the young mongoose saves his family from a krait and from two cobras, named Nag and Nagaina. This story was later made into several movies, and also a song by Donovan. There is a Mongoose fictional character in Bram Stoker's novel, The Lair of the White Worm. The main character, Adam Salton, buys one to hunt snakes.
