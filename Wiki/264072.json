It can also be a remark or question, often disparaging (also called insinuation), that works indirectly by allusion. In the latter sense, the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that the words as used, taken literally, seem to be innocent in the direct meaning (but have a negative unspoken meaning). An innuendo is \"an oblique hint or remark\";Oxford illustrated dictionary. The word is often used to express disapproval.
