Unlike to most other even-numbered U.S. Highways, US 52 usually follows a northwest–southeast route, and is signed north–south or east–west depending on the state you are on the route. Example: If you drive on Illinois it will be signed as east- west, but if you drive on Virginia it will be signed as north-south. The highway northwestern end is in Portal, North Dakota at the Canada–United States border, where it continues as Saskatchewan Highway 39. The highway southeastern end is in Charleston, South Carolina. In US 52, the highway goes with several cities and towns like Minot, North Dakota or Mount Airy, North Carolina. In Ohio and West Virginia, US 52 follows along the Kentucky border. In South Carolina, despite the highway travels from north-south, it is signed as east-west. ==Cities along the highway== *Minot, North Dakota *Fargo, North Dakota *St. Cloud, Minnesota *Minneapolis-Saint Paul *Rochester, Minnesota *Chicago *Lafayette, Indiana *Indianapolis *Cincinnati *Mount Airy, North Carolina *Winston-Salem, North Carolina *Florence, South Carolina *Charleston, South Carolina ==Direction of the highway== East-West: North Dakota, Illinois, Indiana?, Ohio, South Carolina North-South: Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina Category:U.S. Highways",
