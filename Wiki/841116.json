 "text": "In Sanamahism (Meitei religion), there are four major classes of deities. These are the Apokpas, the Imung Lais, the Lam Lais and the Umang Lais. # Apokpa - The Apokpa is a class of deities which are regarded as the ancestors of the mankind. Every family and clan has their ancestral deity each. For example, the Khuman Apokpa is the Apokpa of the Khuman dynasty. # Imung Lai - The Imung Lai is a class of deities which dwell inside the household of the mankind. They are the protectors and the protectresses of the living house. # Lam Lai - The Lam Lai is a class of deities which dwell in the villages and countrysides. The feminine form of \"Lam Lai\" is \"Lam Leima\". # Umang Lai - The Umang Lai is a class of deities which dwell in the forests and woods. They are the protectors and the protectresses of the woodlands. Notably, the Umang Lai sacred groves are preserved in dedication to them. Sometimes, some scholars classify the classes into three, excluding the Apokpa. ==References== Category:Meitei gods and goddesses",
