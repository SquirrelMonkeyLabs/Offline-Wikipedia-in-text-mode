 "text": "Don't ask, don't tell was a rule of the United States Military. It said that openly homosexual or bisexual people could not serve in the military. Gay, lesbian, or bisexual people could only serve in their military if they did not tell anyone their sexual orientation. This is sometimes called being \"in the closet\". Officers were not allowed to ask military members if they were gay. They were also not allowed to discriminate against people who thought they were gay. However, people could be discharged, or sent out of the military, for having sex with a person of the same sex. The rule became official in 1993, after President Bill Clinton signed it. It was repealed, or canceled, in 2011, by President Barack Obama. Since 2011, people who are openly homosexual and bisexual can serve in the military. == Related pages == *LGBT rights in the United States == References == Category:Military of the United States Category:LGBT rights Category:American LGBT rights law",
