Various functions of the pericardium include preventing dislocation of heart by maintaining its original position, providing mechanical support to the heart and its great vessels and act as a lubrication, to lessen friction between the heart and the neighboring structures. ==Gross anatomy== Anatomically It has two main parts fibrous pericardium and serous pericardium. == Histology == Histologically, pericardium consists of three layers: the serosa, the fibrosa, and an outer layer of epipericardial connective tissue. Pericardial fluid is present in between these two layers. The parietal pericardium (thickness 0.8â€“1 mm) consists of an outer fibrous connective tissue sac lined by serosa. The serosa comprises unilayer mesothelium (which is responsible for the formation and reabsorption of pericardial fluid) . It is surrounded by variable amount of fatty tissues, particularly in the cardiophrenic angles.Structure of the Human Pericardium and Responses to Pathologic Processes\". American College of Cardiology. Retrieved 2021-08-11 The pericardial sac consists of two pericardial sinuses namely oblique sinus and transverse sinus. == Clinical anatomy == Pericardial effusion is clinical conditions characterized by excessive pericardial fluids in between the parietal and visceral layers. Pericardiocentesis is a clinical procedure carried out to remove excessive fluid that has built up in a pericardium.\"Pericardiocentesis\". hopkinsmedicine.org.
