 "text": "Michigan's 12th congressional district is a U.S. congressional district in Michigan. After Michigan's congressional map was redrawn in 2022, the 12th lost Ann Arbor and most of its suburbs and was re-centered around the cities of Detroit and Dearborn. During the 113th Congress (2013 to 2015), the district was represented by John Dingell (D). He was a congressman for this and other districts for 59 years, making him the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history. He was replaced by his wife, Debbie Dingell, who currently represents the 6th congressional district. The current district is represented by Democrat Rashida Tlaib. ==References== Category:Congressional districts of Michigan",
