 "text": "The BMW Z4 is a rear-wheel drive sports car by the German car maker BMW. It is part of a line of past BMW roadsters such as the BMW Z1, BMW 507, BMW Z8, and the BMW Z3. The Z4 replaces the Z3. First generation production started in 2002 to replace the BMW Z3 introduced in 1995, at a plant in Greer, South Carolina, of BMW US. Both roadster and coupe versions of the car were made. The Z4â€™s body dimensions were larger and its wheelbase was longer and wider. The suspension was also upgraded to be stiffer and the car was equipped with a sport package which firmed up the steering. When it came out, it won Automobile magazine's \"Design of the Year Award\". With the 2009 model year, BMW started making the second-generation Z4 at BMW's Regensburg, Germany plant as a retractable hardtop roadster. In 2009, the BMW Z4 II won the Red Dot Design Award. == References == Category:BMW automobiles Category:Sports cars",
