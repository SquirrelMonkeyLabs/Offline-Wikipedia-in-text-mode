 "text": "43 Ariadne is a fairly big and bright main belt asteroid. It is the second- biggest member of the Flora asteroid family. It was found by N. R. Pogson on April 15, 1857 and named after the Greek heroine Ariadne. == Characteristics == Ariadne is very stretched out (almost twice as long as its smallest shape). It is a retrograde rotator, although its pole points almost parallel to the ecliptic towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-15°, 235°) with a 10° uncertainty[2]. This gives an axial tilt of about 105°. == Trivia == * For reasons unknown, \"Asteroid 43 Ariadne\" was included in a list of names of supporters of the NASA spacecraft Stardust that was stored on a microchip within the spacecraft. * The maximum apparent size of Ariadne is equal to the maximum apparent size of Pluto. == References == * Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey * M.
