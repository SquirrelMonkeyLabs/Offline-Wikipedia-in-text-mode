 "text": "Andrea Pirlo (born 19 May 1979) is an Italian football player. He was born on May 19, 1979, in Flero, a commune in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy to parents Luigi and Lidia. He has a brother named Ivan. He drew international attention for the first time at 13, when he and his team, ‘Voluntas Brescia U15s’, participated in the 1992 ‘Dana Cup’. They made it to the semi-finals before being knocked out. He spoke for Juventus and Italy national team. He is widely considered as one of the greatest deep-lying playmakers in midfield of all time. He started his club career as an attacking midfielder but often failed to make the starting XI in various clubs he played for, primarily due to his lack of pace. During his time at Brescia, manager Carlo Mazzone took the innovative decision of utilizing Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker. He thrived in the new position. In 2020, Juventus appointed Andrea Pirlo as their new Head Coach. ==Club career statistics== |- |1994/95||rowspan=\"4\"|Brescia||Serie A||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||1||0 |- |1995/96||rowspan=\"2\"|Serie B||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||0||0 |- |1996/97||17||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||18||2 |- |1997/98||Serie A||29||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||30||4 |- |1998/99||Internazionale Milano||Serie A||18||0||5||0||7||0||30||0 |- |1999/00||Reggina||Serie A||29||6||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||30||6 |- |2000/01||Internazionale Milano||Serie A||4||0||1||0||3||0||8||0 |- |2000/01||Brescia||Serie A||10||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||10||0 |- |2001/02||rowspan=\"9\"|Milan||rowspan=\"9\"|Serie A||18||2||2||0||9||0||29||2 |- |2002/03||27||9||2||0||13||0||42||9 |- |2003/04||32||6||0||0||10||1||42||7 |- |2004/05||30||4||1||0||12||1||43||5 |- |2005/06||33||4||4||0||12||1||49||5 |- |2006/07||34||2||4||0||14||1||52||3 |- |2007/08||33||3||1||0||9||2||43||5 |- |2008/09||26||1||0||0||3||1||29||2 |- |2009/10|||||||||||||||| 341||43||24||0||92||7||457||50 341||43||24||0||92||7||457||50 |} ==International career statistics== |- |2002||4||0 |- |2003||1||0 |- |2004||7||1 |- |2005||9||3 |- |2006||14||1 |- |2007||8||1 |- |2008||9||1 |- |2009||12||1 |- |2010||8||1 |- |2011||9||0 |- |2011||9||0 |- |2012||13||2 |- |2013||13||2 |- !Total||107||13 |} ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Lombardy Category:Italy at UEFA Euro 2004 Category:Italy at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Category:Italy at UEFA Euro 2008 Category:Italy at the 2010 FIFA World Cup Category:Italy at UEFA Euro 2012 Category:Italy at the 2014 FIFA World Cup",
