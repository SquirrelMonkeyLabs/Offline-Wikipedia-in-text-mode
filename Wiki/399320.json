On 19 November 1620, the Mayflower spotted land. They had intended to go to Virginia Colony but the ship was damaged so they landed at Cape Cod on 21 November. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.

The Mayflower passengers owed money to people in England who had helped pay for their voyage. Allerton was supposed to go to England and pay off some of this debt. Some of the people did not think that he was honest with the money. On one of his trips back from England, in 1630, Allerton came back without some of the supplies which they very much needed.David Lindsay, PhD., Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp. 80-81 In 1634, another sickness came to Plymouth Colony which caused many people to die including Allerton's second wife Fear.Jacob Bailey Moore, Memoirs of American Governors (Washington 1846 pub.
