The mine is the fourth largest copper deposit and the largest known single deposit of uranium in the world. Copper is about 70% of the mine's revenue. The rest is got from uranium, and about 5% from silver and gold. BHP has owned and operated the mine since 2005. The mine was previously owned by Western Mining Corporation. == References == Category:Ores Category:Buildings and structures in Australia Category:Uranium Category:Copper",
