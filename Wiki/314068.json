 "text": "Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener KG, KP, GCB, OM, GCSI, GCMG, GCIE, ADC, PC (24 June 1850 â€“ 4 June 1916) was a British field marshal. Born in Ireland, Kitchener was the Sirdar (British Commander in Chief) of the Egyptian Army. He defeated the Mahdist rebels against Egyptian rule in 1898 and conquered the Sudan for Britain and (nominally) Egypt. He was chief of staff during the Second Boer War (1899-1902). From 1899 to 1900, he was also commander-in-chief of the forces in southern Africa. He was allowed into many orders of chivalry, both British and foreign, including Knights of St. Patrick and Knight of the Garter. At the start of the First World War, British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith appointed him as Secretary of State for War. A massive recruitment campaign began for the New Armies, also called \"Kitchener's Army\". His image was used in a famous advertisement. Kitchener was drowned in 1916 when HMS Hampshire sank near the Orkney Islands after it had hit a German mine. ==References== Category:1850 births Category:1916 deaths Category:British Army people Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire Category:Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Knights of Justice of the Order of St John Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Order of Merit Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Military people killed in World War I Category:People from the Republic of Ireland",
