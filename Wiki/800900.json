The survey was done by J. P. Joshi. The site contains the ruins of an ancient Indus Valley Civilization.Indian Archaeology 1976-77, A Review. Archeologival Survey of India, New Delhi.1980. Page 19-21. ASI == Excavation == The excavation found 9.20 meters deep of ruins. These consists of items found in 3 different periods of time. The first period contain two sub periods. The second period has early historical pottery. They are from North India. These pottery are similar to the those discovered elsewhere in North India. The third period consists of antiquities from the Kushan period. There are also house walls and a 3 meters wide street found in the ruins. The site seems to have been deserted after that.Indian Archaeology 1976-77, A Review. Archeologival Survey of India, New Delhi.1980. Page 19-21. ASI == Historical significance == Manda is on the right river bank of Chenab River. The river is at the foot of Pir Panjal mountain range. Manda is 28 km northwest of Jammu. It was thought to be the northernmost limit of the Harappan Civilisation. It is also considered the northmost site of Indus Valley Civilisation. Manda is likely a town that is set up by people of the Indus Valley Civilisation. They likely use it to do logging to get wood from Himalayan Sub mountains. They use the river near the town to send the wood to other towns of the Indus Valley Civilization.McIntosh, Jane.(2008) The Ancient Indus Valley, New Perspectives. ABC-CLIO.Page 209,412 == Artefacts == There are several artefacts found in the site. They include redware from the Pre Harappan era. These redware are terracotta jar, plates, racks for plates and others. These made up of 15% to 25% of total artefacts found.Indian Archaeology 1976-77, A Review.
