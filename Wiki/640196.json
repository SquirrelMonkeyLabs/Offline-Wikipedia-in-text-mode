Murphy died on 15 May 2018, in Dublin at the age of 83. President Michael D. Higgins said: “The importance of Tom Murphy’s contribution to Irish theatre is immeasurable and outstanding. We have had no greater use of language for the stage than in the body of work produced by Tom Murphy since his earliest work in the 1960s.”Clement, Olivia. \"Irish Playwright Tom Murphy Dies at 83\" Playbill, May 17, 2018 ==References== ==Other websites== * Tom Murphy at Irish Writers Online * Aosdána short biography * doollee.com listing of Tom Murphy's works written for the stage Category:1935 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Irish playwrights Category:Irish novelists Category:Writers from Dublin",
