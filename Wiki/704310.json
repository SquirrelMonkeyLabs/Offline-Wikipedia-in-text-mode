 "text": "Brian Stephen Giles (JAYH-ulz; born January 20, 1971) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder. During his career he played for the Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and San Diego Padres. The left-handed Giles was a two-time All-Star and had a career line of .291/.400/.502 with 287 home runs, 411 doubles, 1,078 runs batted in (RBI), and 1,183 walks in 1,847 games. Although a bit suspect with the glove, Giles was a do-it-all batter at the plate, posting one of the highest OPS of all-time. During his prime, Giles carried a stagnant Pittsburgh Pirates offense as the main batting prowess outside of Aramis Ram√≠rez in the lineup and posted an OPS over 1. He received MVP votes every year during this time. Giles was known for his unique, low-crouched batting stance at the plate, similar to Jeff Bagwell. His younger brother, Marcus Giles, is a former Major League infielder who was most notable for playing with the Atlanta Braves organization.
