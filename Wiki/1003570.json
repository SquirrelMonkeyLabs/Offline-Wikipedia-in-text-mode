The actual line of succession may be much longer as there could be other legitimate descendants of King Ugyen Wangchuck. ==Eligibility== The legitimate descendants of King Ugyen Wangchuck are presently entitled to succeed. If a king dies leaving a pregnant wife, the unborn child will automatically assume a place in the line of succession if there is no male heir. A person loses his or her succession rights if he or she marries a person who is not a natural born Bhutanese citizen. ==References== Succession Bhutan",
