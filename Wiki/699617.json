 "text": "Gars (or garpike) are a type of ray-finned fish. They are part of a group called the Lepisosteiformes. Gars have long bodies that are heavily armoured with scales. Their long jaws have long, sharp teeth. All gars are relatively large fish. Some have been reported to be in length. However, they typically grow to and weigh over . They are carnivores which eat other fish. There are seven species of living gars. Their peak period was in the early Mesozoic. Once worldwide, they are now confined to the Americas. Unusually, their swim bladders can function as lungs. Most gars surface once in while to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans. However, their eggs are highly toxic. ==Phylogeny== Gars are the family Lepisosteidae. This is the only living family in the order Lepisosteiformes. Most fish are teleosts, but gars are Holostei. == Genera == === Extant === * Atractosteus * Lepisosteus === Extinct === * Nhanulepisosteus * Masillosteus * Cuneatus == References ==",
