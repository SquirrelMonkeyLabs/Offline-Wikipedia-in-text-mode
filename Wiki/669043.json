 "text": "The Toronto Metropolitan University is a university in Toronto, Canada. The university's original name was the Ryerson Institute of Technology. It was named after Egerton Ryerson. From 2002 to 2022, the university was called Ryerson University. Because Egerton Ryerson was involved in the creation of the Canadian Indian residential school system, many students and staff at the university wanted to change its name. In 2022, it was decided to rename the university to the Toronto Metropolitan University. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Colleges and universities in Ontario Category:Organizations based in Toronto",
