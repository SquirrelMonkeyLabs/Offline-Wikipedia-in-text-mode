 "text": "The VSS, also called the Vintorez, (rus. Винторез, literally \"screw cutter\") is a sniper rifle featuring a built-in suppressor (similar to that of the AS- Val) the weapon is loaded with heavy subsonic 9×39mm SP5 cartridges and armor- piercing SP6 cartridges. It was manufactured (created) by the Soviet company TsNIITochMash during the late 1980s. It is issued primarily to Spetsnaz units for secretive operations, a role made evident by its ability to be broken down for transport in a specially fitted case. == Design == The way the gun operates and the silencer system used on the VSS are based from the AS assault rifle. The VSS is a gas-operated select-fire rifle. It has a long-stroke gas piston operating rod in a gas cylinder above the barrel. The weapon catch is held in its place thanks to a rotating bolt who attach themselves to the appropriate socket when needed. The VSS is striker fired. It features a cross- bolt type fire selector switch located behind the trigger, inside the trigger guard; the safety lever and the charging handle resemble those used in Kalashnikov weapons. The skeletonized wooden stock is a more rounded version of that provided on the SVD rifle; it has a rubber shoulder pad and can be removed when the rifle is dismantled for compact storage. The forward handguard is made from a high-impact polymer. If needed, the weapon can be used in fully automatic mode using either its original 10-round magazine or the 20-round magazines from the AS rifle.
