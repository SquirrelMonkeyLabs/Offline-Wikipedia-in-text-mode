 "text": "On January 29, 2025, a mid-air collision occurred when American Airlines Flight 5342, a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport in Kansas to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport near Washington, D.C., collided in a mid-air with a United States Army Sikorsky VH-60M Black Hawk helicopter. All 67 people on two aircrafts (64 on American Airlines Flight 5342; Bombardier CRJ700 series and 3 Priority Air Transport 25; Sikorsky UH-60L Black Hawk) died in the crash. This accident was the first fatal crash involving American Airlines since the crash of Flight 587 on November 12, 2001. This accident was also the first fatal crash for a commercial airline on to have occurred in the United States since PenAir Flight 3296 in 2019. == Accident == Less than 30 seconds before the collision, an air traffic controller asked the helicopter crew whether they had Flight 5342 in sight. A crew member replied that they could see the airliner, and requested \"visual separation\" from the plane; this was approved by the controllers. A few seconds before the collision, the air traffic controller ordered the helicopter to pass behind Flight 5342. At 8:48 p.m. EST, Flight 5342 collided with the Black Hawk, which exploded, then crashed into the middle of the Potomac River. Flight 5342's radio transponder ceased transmitting about short of runway 33. The incident was captured by a webcam at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Another video shows a brief trail of fire. The CRJ700 \"split in half\" in the river, while the helicopter crashed in the river upside down and near the crashed plane. A pilot in an uninvolved aircraft confirmed seeing the crash to an air traffic controller, and reported seeing flares from the side of the Potomac opposite to them as they were on short final. === Victims === Within hours, law enforcement officials and sources confirmed deaths. On February 4, officials confirmed all 67 bodies were found. ==References== Category:January 2025 events Category:2020s in Virginia Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2025 Category:2025 disasters in the United States",
