 "text": "Rocket Arena is a multi-use arena located in Cleveland, Ohio that serves as the home for the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League (AHL). The arena was also the home of the Cleveland Rockers of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 1997 until 2003. They first started to build the stadium on April 27, 1992. The arena opened on October 17, 1994 and the first event was a concert by Billy Joel. The Cavaliers had their first game in the arena on November 8, 1994. In their first game, they were defeated by the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets 199â€“109. When the arena opened, it did not have a sponsor and was named Gund Arena after Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund. The name would last until August 2005. Dan Gilbert would buy the Cavaliers in August 2005 for $375 million. Gilbert would rename the arena Quicken Loans Arena which he named after his mortgage lending company Quicken Loans. After the company rebranded, the arena was changed to Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse along with the company. The company rebranded again to simply Rocket in early 2025, with the arena name changing on February 18. WWE has hosted many shows and pay-per-views at the arena including the SummerSlam in 1996, No Mercy in 1999, Invasion in 2001, Survivor Series in 2004, Unforgiven in 2008, TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs in 2014, and the 2016 and 2019 Fastlane pay-per-views. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Buildings and structures in Ohio",
