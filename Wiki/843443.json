 "text": "Jason Derek Brown (born July 1, 1969) is an American man. Brown is wanted for first degree murder and armed robbery in Phoenix, Arizona. On November 29, 2004, according to the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation, Brown shot and killed an armored car guard just outside a movie theater and stole the money. Three years later, on December 8, 2007, the FBI named him as the 489th fugitive to be put on its Ten Most Wanted list. On November 29, 2004, Robert Keith Palomares, a 24-year-old armored car guard, was carrying the weekend deposits just outside the AMC theater at 4915 E. Ray Road in Phoenix. Not long after 10 a.m., a hooded gunman ambushed and shot Palomares with a .45 caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol. Five of six bullets struck Palomares in his head. Though he was armed, Palomares didn't have time to defend himself. The gunman took a bag of money with $56,000 in cash and left the crime scene on a bicycle. Palomares was taken to the Good Samaritan Hospital. He was pronounced dead. Witnesses had described the shooter as between 25 and 30 years old and Hispanic. The authorities then recovered the bicycle. They lifted fingerprints from it that linked Brown to the ambush murder. Brown was then the prime suspect in the case. He was charged by the Maricopa County Superior Court with armed robbery and first degree murder on December 4. Two days later, he was charged with a federal count of Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution by United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Brown was born in Los Angeles, California ==References== Category:People from Los Angeles Category:American robbers Category:American murderers Category:1969 births Category:Living people",
