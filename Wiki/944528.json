Scientists have seen it between 250 and 1000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 35.6–50.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 52.7–75.7 mm long. This frog is brown or green-brown in color with marks across its back. Its belly is pink, orange, or whitish. The adult male frogs have bumps on their backs. The female frog lays 30-40 eggs at a time. This frog lives in primary forest and near the edges of forests. The young frogs are brown-bronze in color. Scienitsts named this frog \"mutabor\" for the Latin word \"mutare\" for \"changing.\" This is because the young frogs change color when they become adult frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
