 "text": "Epsilon Aurigae, also called Maaz or Almaaz, is a yellow supergiant star forming part of the Auriga constellation. It is orbited by a binary star which is surrounded by a thick dusk cloud. The dust cloud only creates infrared light. The dust cloud was originally thought to be the largest star known, before it was later revealed to not be a star. The largest star was later found to be VY Canis Majoris, and even later, WOH G64. Another theory says that the dusk cloud could be a black hole, but this theory is no longer believed in.
