COLTS procured 4 buses from the South Central Transit Authority (SCTA) to fill a gap with the lack of buses in their fleet. One of the buses came from Red Rose Transit Authority. 0410 was donated to the Reading Muhlenberg Career and Technology Center for students to use for hands-on training after it retired at the end of 2016. 0407 was presumably going to be donated to the Berks Career and Technology Center. However, when it was listed for auction on Public Surplus website in February 2017, the transmission was broken. So therefore, 0407 was not donated to any of the CTCs for training, and it had to be towed from the property at the expense of the person with winning bid. 0756 and 0858 went to AppalCART in Boone, North Carolina. 0857 and 0861 went to ShuttleBus in York County, Maine. All three of the New Flyers went to Indian Trails in Owosso, Michigan. They were renumbered 44-46, and 44 was assigned to Western Michigan University (Bronco Transit) service while 46 was assigned to Walmart Shopper Shuttle service. Category:Transport in Pennsylvania",
