Pachycormus is an extinct genus of pachycormiform from the Toarcian (about 185â€“182 million years ago) of Europe. This fish had no pelvic fins. == Description == Pachycormus superficially resembled a giant tuna. It was able to grow 1 m (3.5 ft) in length. It is characterized by falciform pectoral fins. The teeth are short and designed for grasping. The caudal fin was deeply forked, just like a modern-day tuna. The body was covered with small scales equipped with ganoine. == Classification == The type species P. macropterus was first named as a species of Elops by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1818. However, this species was placed into Pachycormus by Louis Agassiz in 1833. == As a basal fish == Pachycormus is the second most basal pachycormiform after Euthynotus. == Distribution == Fossils have been found in marine deposits from France, Germany, and England. == Image gallery == == Related pages == * Pleuropholis * Amblypterus * Orthocormus * Bonnerichthys == References == # Roberts, George (1839).
