 "text": "Douglas C. \"Doug\" Kenney (December 10, 1946 - August 27, 1980) was an American writer and actor. He was born in Palm Beach, Florida. He was one of the co- founders of National Lampoon magazine, along with Henry Beard and Robert Hoffman. Kenney collaborated with Beard at the Harvard Lampoon, which they wrote for while they went to the namesake college. They both co-wrote the satirical novel Bored of the Rings. Afterwards, they went to make a nationwide version of the magazine christened, The National Lampoon. The magazine spun off into a radio show, a TV special, albums and filmsâ€”which he also wrote for. He co-wrote the National Lampoon's Animal House, which he also had an extended cameo in as \"The Stork\". After the success of Animal House, he produced and wrote Caddyshack--which he also had a nameless cameo in. He had a bit part in the 1977 film Between the Line. Kenney died after falling from a thirty-foot cliff in Kauai, Hawaii. He was 33 years old. Kenney's death was ruled as \"accidental\". ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1946 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:American movie actors Category:Movie producers from Florida Category:Screenwriters from Florida Category:Actors from Florida Category:People from West Palm Beach, Florida",
