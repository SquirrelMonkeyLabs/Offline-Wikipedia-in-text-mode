 "text": "The Judgment Day is an evil professional wrestling stable in WWE. They are a part of the Raw brand. The members of the group are Finn Bálor, Dominik Mysterio, JD McDonagh, Carlito, Liv Morgan, and Raquel Rodriguez. Former members include Edge, Damian Priest and Rhea Ripley. As part of the group, Bálor and McDonagh are former World Tag Team Champions, Priest is a former World Heavyweight Champion, and Morgan and Ripley are former Women’s World Champions. Bálor and Priest were also the last Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions, having two reigns with both the Raw Tag Team Championship (now called the World Tag Team Championship) and SmackDown Tag Team Championship (now called the WWE Tag Team Championship). Priest is also the 2023 Men's Money in the Bank winner. The stable was created in 2022. It was led by Edge. It had a dark gothic/supernatural theme. Edge was removed from the group after Bálor joined. The supernatural elements became less after Edge left. The group changed into more of a street thug/goth bully group. In 2023, Bálor added his real-life student and NXT call-up, JD McDonagh. He joined the group and started to help them in their matches. R-Truth has tried to join them since December, but he was not seen as an official member of the group. In May 2024, Carlito became an associate for the stable. At SummerSlam on August 3, 2024, Priest and Ripley turned on the group. Mysterio's on-screen relationship Liv Morgan also joined the stable that day. Raquel Rodriguez joined the group at Bad Blood. ==Timeline== == Championships and accomplishments == * ESPN ** Female Wrestler of the Year (2023) – Ripley * New York Post ** Faction of the Year (2023) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** Faction of the Year (2023) ** Match of the Year (2023) ** Most Hated Wrestler of the Year (2023) – Mysterio ** Woman of the Year (2023) – Ripley ** Ranked Ripley No. 1 of the top 250 women's singles wrestlers in the PWI Women's 250 in 2023 ** Ranked Bálor No. 61 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2023 ** Ranked Priest No. 71 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2023 ** Ranked Mysterio No. 94 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2023 * Wrestling Observer Newsletter ** Women's Wrestling MVP (2023) – Ripley * WWE ** Women's World Championship (2 times) – Ripley (1), Morgan (1) ** World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) – Priest ** NXT North American Championship (2 times) – Mysterio ** World Tag Team Championship (3 times) – Bálor and Priest (2), Bálor and McDonagh (1) ** WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship (2 times) – Bálor and Priest ** Women's Royal Rumble (2023) – Ripley ** Men's Money in the Bank (2023) – Priest ** Seventh Women's Triple Crown Champion – Ripley ** Fifth Women's Grand Slam Champion – Ripley ** 17th Grand Slam Champion (under current format; 24th overall) – Bálor ** Slammy Award (4 times) *** Faction of the Year (2024) *** Female Superstar of the Year (2024) – Ripley *** Match of the Year (2024) *** Villain of the Year (2024) – Mysterio ==Footnotes== == References == == Other websites == * * * * * * * * * * Judgment Day Profile at Cagematch.net Category:WWE teams and stables",
