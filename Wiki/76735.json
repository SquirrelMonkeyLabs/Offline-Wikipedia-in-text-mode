Reuters is one of the largest news agencies in the world. The agency was established in London in 1851 by the German-born Paul Reuter. It was bought by the Thomson Corporation of Canada in 2008. == History == === 19th century === Paul Reuter worked at a book-publishing firm in Berlin. He gave out radical pamphlets at the beginning of the Revolutions in 1848. In 1850, Reuter developed a news service in Aachen using homing pigeons and electric telegraphy from 1851 on. Reuter moved to London in 1851 and established a news wire agency at the London Royal Exchange. Reuter's company covered topics like commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms. Reuter's company started becoming famous for reporting on important topics first many times. For example, it was the first in Europe to report Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865. In 1872, Reuter's expanded into the Far East, followed by South America in 1874. In 1878, Reuter retired as managing director. He was replaced by his eldest son, Herbert de Reuter. In 1883, Reuter's began transmitting messages electrically to London newspapers. === 20th century === Reuter's son Herbert de Reuter continued as general manager until his death by suicide in 1915. The company returned to private ownership in 1916 and the company was renamed to \"Reuters Limited\", removing the apostrophe. In 1925, the Press Association (PA) of Great Britain became very interested in Reuters and some years later got full ownership. In 1945, Reuters was the first broadcasting company to broadcast news of Heinrich Himmler's attempts to negotiate with the western allies through Count Bernadotte, a Swedish nobleman. == References == == Other websites == * * Times of Crisis – multimedia interactive charting the year of global change * Bearing Witness award-winning multimedia reflecting on war in Iraq * Reuters – The State of the World – News imagery of the 21st century * Thomson Reuters Foundation – philanthropic foundation * Category:Mass media in the United Kingdom Category:Webby Award winners Category:1851 establishments in Europe Category:1850s establishments in the United Kingdom",
