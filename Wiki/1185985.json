 "text": "India recognizes the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea, DPRK) diplomatically. India and North Korea established diplomatic relations in 1962, and India has maintained a policy of non-interference in North Korea's internal affairs while promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. India’s recognition is largely driven by historical factors, such as the Cold War context and India's traditional non-alignment policy, where it engaged with both sides of global conflicts. Additionally, India has continued to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the issues surrounding North Korea, often supporting dialogue rather than sanctions. India has consistently called for denuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and has supported various United Nations resolutions on the issue, while maintaining diplomatic ties with Pyongyang.
