 "text": "Peter Tosh (born Winston McIntosh, October 19, 1944- September 11, 1987) was a Jamaican reggae musican. He was a member of the Wailers with Bob Marley and Bunny Livingston. He was a Rastafarian and sang very political songs. His songs were a lot more radical than his friend, Bob Marley's, whom he often criticized for selling out to the white mainstream. He also toured with the Rolling Stones and sang a duet with Mick Jagger. He was murdered in his home in Kingston during a robbery in 1987. His biggest claim to fame was a song titled \"Legalize It\" in relation to marijuana laws. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Negril (1975) * Legalize It (1976) * Equal Rights (1977) * Bush Doctor (1978) * Mystic Man (1979) * Wanted Dread And Alive (1981) * Mama Africa (1983) * No Nuclear War (1987) * I Am That I Am (2001) ===Live albums=== * Captured Live (1984) * Live at the One Love Peace Concert (2000) * Live & Dangerous: Boston 1976 (2001) * Live At The Jamaica World Music Festival 1982 (2002) * Complete Captured Live (2004) ===Compilations=== These are the highest rated compilation albums on Allmusic. * Collection Gold (1994) * The Toughest (1996) * The Best of Peter Tosh - Dread Don't Die (1996) * Honorary Citizen (1997) * Scrolls Of The Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh (1999) * Arise Black Man (1999) * The Essential Peter Tosh - the Columbia Years (2003) * Talking Revolution (2005) ==References== ==Other websites== * Peter Tosh on Allmusic * Discography * Peter Tosh - Jamaicapage.com Feature * VitalSpot - Peter Tosh Category:1944 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Jamaican reggae musicians Category:Murdered musicians Category:Jamaican activists Category:Jamaican singer-songwriters",
