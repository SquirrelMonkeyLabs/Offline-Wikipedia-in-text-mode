Singrauli is emerging as India's energy capital. The place earlier known as Shringavali, named after the sage Shringi, was once covered with dense forests and inhabited by wild animals. The place was considered so treacherous that it was used by the kings of Rewa State, who ruled the area till 1947, as an open air prison for errant civilians and officers.In the 1800s, there were three separate rulers of Singrauli (previously known as Sidhi), ruling three parts of the territory: First were the Chandela rulers from Bardi (Khatai). Second was Rajasahab Madwas, He was a Baland(kharwar), ruled in Majhauli block mostly.
