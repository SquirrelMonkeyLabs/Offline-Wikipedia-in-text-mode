A brief history of the Folies-Bergère Art & Architecture In 1882, Édouard Manet painted the famous A Bar at the Folies-Bergère.

In the early 1890s, the American dancer Loïe Fuller starred at the Folies Bergère. In 1902, illness forced Marchand to leave after 16 years.Édouard Marchand et les Folies bergère In French with many details and graphics. In 1918, Paul Derval (1880–1966) made his mark on the review.
