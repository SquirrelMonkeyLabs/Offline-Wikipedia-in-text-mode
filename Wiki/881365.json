 "text": "The 2021 New Jersey gubernatorial election took place on November 2, 2021, to elect the governor of New Jersey. Current Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who was first elected in 2017 with 56% of the vote, ran for reelection to a second term. He formally announced his plans to run for a second term on October 1, 2020. He faced Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, Green nominee Madelyn Hoffman, Libertarian nominee Gregg Mele and SWP nominee Joanne Kuniansky in the general election. Based on polling numbers, many thought Murphy was going to easily win re-election. Murphy beat Ciattarelli in a result that was closer than expected. Murphy is the first Democratic Governor of New Jersey to win re-election since Brendan Byrne in 1977. Murphy was sworn in for a second term on January 18, 2022. ==Polls== Source of poll aggregation Date(s) administered Dates updated Phil Murphy Jack Ciattarelli Gregg Mele Madelyn Hoffman Joanne Kuniansky Other/ Undecided Lead Real Clear Politics Oct 15–31, 2021 Nov 1, 2021 50.5% 42.7% - - - 6.8% 7.8% === Table === Poll source Date(s) administered Sample size Margin Phil Murphy Jack Ciattarelli Gregg Mele Madelyn Hoffman Joanne Kuniansky Other Undecided Lead Research Co.
