 "text": "Aviator glasses are sunglasses or eyeglasses with a double nose bridge and usually teardrop shaped lenses. Aviator glasses were originally made by Bausch and Lomb ( the company that would become Ray-Ban) for pilots in Second World War to protect their eyes while flying at high altitudes, and the glasses resemble pilot's goggles. Aviator glasses are not only made by RayBan, but also Randolph Engineering, American Optical, (the latter made the sunglasses worn by the Apollo program astronauts enroute to the Moon). As clear lens or slightly tinted eyeglasses, aviators were most popular during the 1970s to 1990s. As sunglasses, the style is most associated with police officers.
