 "text": "Gambling age is the age when a person is allowed to gamble in casinos or lotteries. Most countries set it at 18. Ages ranging from 13 to 25 exist. In some federated countries, such as the United States, have it set depending on the state or province. A few jurisdictions today have lowered it to 13. This topic connects up with various other age-related permissions, such as age limit on purchasing tobacco, and age of possible marriage. Use of terms such as \"teenager\" needs to be clear as to what the term covers. Category:Gambling",
