In December 2021, he became the Minister of Finance. On 23 February 2025, Lindner resigned as party leader and announced his retirement from active politics after the FDP lost all of their seats in parliament as a result of the 2025 federal election. He is widely blamed for the party's massive loss in the Bundestag during the election. == References == Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:politicians of the Free Democratic Party of Germany Category:members of the German Bundestag Category:Politicians from Wuppertal Category:Finance ministers of Germany",
