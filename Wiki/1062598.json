 "text": "The Australian football league system is the league structure for football clubs in Australia. Since 1977, the system has had one national league at the top and many state and territory leagues below. From 1977 until 2004, the national league was called the National Soccer League (NSL). Since 2005, the A-League Men has been the country's national league. The women's football league system works similar to the men's, with one national league (the A-League Women) at the top and many state and territory leagues below. ==Current system (until 2024)==
