 "text": "In Kent, England, the Medway Tunnel connects Strood and Chatham beneath the River Medway. The Medway Towns Northern Relief Road (A289) includes it. The Medway Tunnel is the first immersed tube tunnel constructed in England and the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom; the other is located in Conwy, North Wales. Although it was expanded in the 1970s, the Rochester Bridge was still extremely crowded and had been the lowest river crossing of the River Medway for generations. In order to alleviate traffic on the bridge, provide better access to the Medway Towns, and aid in the revitalization of Chatham Dockyard, the Medway Tunnel was suggested downstream of the bridge in the late 1980s.
