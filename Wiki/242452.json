 "text": "Alexei Nikolaevich (; â€“ 17 July 1918) was the last Russian tsesarevich (heir apparent). He was the youngest child and only son of Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Romanovs were placed on house arrest by Bolsheviks in Tobolsk, Siberia. The Ural Regional Soviet ordered the murder of the Romanov family on July 17, 1918. Rumors persisted for decades that Alexei had escaped his execution, with many impostors claiming his identity. Alexei's remains, along with those of his sister Maria and Anastasia were discovered in a second grave near the rest of the Romanov family in 2007. On July 17. 1998, the Romanovs were formally buried in the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, exactly 80 years after their death. The Romanov family was canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000. ==Notes== ==References== == Other websites == * AkexeiRomanov.org includes Articles on Alexei, 3D images and more * FrozenTears.org A media library of the last Imperial Family. * The Romanov Memorial * The Murder of Russia's Imperial Family, Nicolay Sokolov.
