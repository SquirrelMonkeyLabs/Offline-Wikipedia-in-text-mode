 "text": "Indian English or South Asian English is several dialects or varieties of English. It is spoken mainly in India, and by first-generation members of the Indian diaspora.Kachru, Braj B. 1983. The Indianisation of English: the English language in India. Oxford University Press. The dialect evolved during and after the British colonial rule of India.Whitworth, George Clifford 1885. An Anglo-Indian dictionary: a glossary of Indian terms used in English, and of such English or other non-Indian terms as have obtained special meanings in India. London: K. Paul, Trench. English is the co-official language of India, with about 90 million speakers, but with fewer than quarter of a million calling it their first language. In 19th-century India, Britain needed to teach English to a body of people who were important to Britain. A number of schools taught and used English in India. They were mostly run by missionaries. Many taught European and Eurasian children and orphans. The graduates of these schools became the first generation of teachers. == References == Category:Dialects of English Category:Languages of India Category:Languages of Bangladesh",
