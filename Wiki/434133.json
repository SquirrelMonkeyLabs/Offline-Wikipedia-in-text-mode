It included a formal procession and then a service at St Paul's Cathedral. Her body was cremated. Her ashes were buried next to those of her husband Denis Thatcher at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London on 28 September 2013. This was what she had wanted. She had refused a state funeral. At the event, the crowds were peaceful. Thousands of supporters cheered and applauded. A few hundred people came to protest at Ludgate Circus, with other protesters scattered along the route. Police reported only one incident, and no arrests. == References == Category:2013 in London Thatcher Category:Margaret Thatcher",
