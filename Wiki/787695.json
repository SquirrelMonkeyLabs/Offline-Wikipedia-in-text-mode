Today, Croatia Records claims to have a 70% share of the Croatian music market and has 30 record stores. Being a successor of Jugoton, from which it gained a very large audio and video collection, Croatia Records is also active in re- releasing numerous digitally remastered former Yugoslav pop and rock titles. During the global retro trend, the company decided to re-introduce gramophone records as well. ==History== The company that is today Croatia Records was founded in 1947 in Zagreb, the capital of the then-People's Republic of Croatia under the name Jugoton, a publicly owned company which was the largest record label and chain record store in the former SFR Yugoslavia. Jugoton signed many popular Yugoslav artists such as: Indexi, Bijelo Dugme, Električni Orgazam, Haustor, Idoli and Leb i Sol, and also many popular foreign stars for the Yugoslav market including: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Madonna, U2, David Bowie, Queen, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode etc. The company also owned a chain of record shops across Yugoslavia. Many Yugoslav entries in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton, like the 1989 winners Riva. ===Croatian independence=== After the change from socialist state to parliamentary democracy in 1989, the question of Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia was raised. In 1991, shortly before the declaration of Croatian independence and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the company's name Jugoton, a portmanteau word of Jugoslavija (Yugoslavia) and tone, was changed to Croatia Records. Parallelly, the major labels in Serbia and Slovenia such as PGP RTB and ZKP RTLJ were renamed to PGP-RTS and ZKP RTVS. The company was now owned by the independent Republic of Croatia, but since socialism had ended, it was sold off to private owners. Since the year of 2000, Croatia Records is ran by professionals from the music industry who are in the partnership company called AUTOR d.o.o. (limited company). In 2001, the musician Miroslav Škoro became the leader of Croatia Records, until his resignation in 2006.24 Sata newspaper, July 30, 2006: (Google cache version) ==Croatia Records Music Publishing== Croatia Records Music Publishing (CRMP d.o.o.) is a company owned by Croatia Records d.d. It manages the rules for using copyrighted music and selling it digitally. Founded in 1947 as part of Jugoton, Croatia Records Music Publishing is its own company. Croatia Records Music Publishing has the largest catalog of Croatian songs and the largest catalog of master recordings made in the last 40 years of the most famous Croatian singers such as Arsen Dedić, Đorđe Novković, Damir Urban, Nenad Ninčević, Zlatan Stipišić - Gibonni, Zdenko Runjić. ==Controversy== Often, the company was a target of public complaint on various issues. Croatia Records has been the object of an issue raised by singer Branimir Štulić over royalty rights. Štulić claims that the royalties of songs by former rock band Azra, of which he was the lead singer in the 1980s, and which was then managed by Jugoton. Štulić has named a sum of 12 million Euros that he thinks Croatia Records owes him, but he has not tried to take legal action to claim it.Slobodna Dalmacija, March 29, 2008: Želimir Babogredac said in response that Croatia Records has all the legal rights to release titles by Štulić and Azra, as the company is a direct successor of Jugoton, whom these artists were signed for. He also said that the sum Štulić claims is too large. However, he added that Croatia Records is proud to have the very popular Štulić in the list of its artists and that he may receive a payment from the sale of audio CDs only if he joins the Croatian Composers' Society - .Slobodna Dalmacija, April 5, 2008: ==Related pages== * Suzy Records * Menart Records * Music of Croatia * Croatian popular music * List of record labels ==References== ==Other websites== * Croatia Records Official site * * Croatia Records at Facebook * Croatian Roots Music - Roots music edition of Croatia Records * - Distributor for the United States and Canada * Croatia Records at Discogs Category:Croatian record labels Category:Organizations based in Zagreb Category:1924 establishments in Europe Category:20th-century establishments in Croatia Category:Companies of Croatia",
