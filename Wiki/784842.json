 "text": "Rabbi Baruch Dov Povarsky (born August 17, 1931) is a Haredi rabbi who lives in Israel. He is the rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh Yeshiva, which is located in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak. == Life story == Rabbi Povarsky was born in the city of Kletsk in the Second Polish Republic; his father was Rabbi Dovid Povarsky. When he was three months old, he and his family moved to the city of Baranavichy, which was in the same country; this was because his father was becoming a teacher in the yeshiva of Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman. When he was ten years old, his entire family moved to Mandatory Palestine (present-day Israel), where he attended several schools before joining the Ponovezh Yeshiva, the school where his father was appointed rosh yeshiva. At that point, Baruch Dov was still a student. In 1954, after he got married, he became a teacher in the yeshiva, and later he became the rosh yeshiva. == References == Category:1931 births Category:Israeli rabbis Category:Living people",
