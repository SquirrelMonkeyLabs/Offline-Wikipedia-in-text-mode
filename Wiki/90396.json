 "text": "Legendary Pokémon are very rare Pokémon in the Pokémon world. Characters in the series often claim that very few people have seen them. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most other Pokémon. They have powers that other Pokémon do not have. In the games some roam around, while others stay in one spot until the main character catches it. If the player defeats a legendary Pokémon, they will often not be available again, because there is only one of them, in rare cases they might reappear after certain conditions are met. Because of this, players usually save their game before going to battle the Pokémon. The Master Ball and Ultra Ball are popular choices for catching legendary Pokémon. But legendary Pokémon can also be caught with a normal Poké Ball. It is often advised to catch a legendary Pokémon with a Quick Ball since a Quick Ball has a high capture rate at the beginning of a battle. Legendary Pokémon typically have a 3/255 catch rate with Ultra Balls, and 1/255 catch rate with regular Poké Balls.
