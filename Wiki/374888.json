On June 26, 1944, Muranaga was in charge of shooting his squad's mortar weapon. He was trying to destroy an enemy artillery gun. Muranaga was able to fire three shells before being killed. The words of Muranaga's citation explain: > Private First Class Kiyoshi K. Muranaga distinguished himself by > extraordinary heroism in action on 26 June 1944, near Suvereto, Italy. > Private First Class Muranaga's company encountered a strong enemy force in > commanding positions and with superior firepower. An enemy 88mm self- > propelled gun opened direct fire on the company, causing the men to disperse > and seek cover. Private First Class Muranaga's mortar squad was ordered to > action, but the terrain made it impossible to set up their weapons. The > squad leader, realizing the vulnerability of the mortar position, moved his > men away from the gun to positions of relative safety. Because of the heavy > casualties being inflicted on his company, Private First Class Muranaga, who > was a gunner, attempted to neutralize the 88mm weapon alone. Voluntarily > remaining at his gun position, Private First Class Muranaga manned the > mortar himself and opened fire on the enemy gun at a range of approximately > 400 yards. With his third round, he was able to correct his fire so that the > shell landed directly in front of the enemy gun. Meanwhile, the enemy crew, > immediately aware of the source of mortar fire, turned their 88mm weapon > directly on Private First Class Muranaga's position. Before Private First > Class Muranaga could fire a fourth round, an 88mm shell scored a direct hit > on his position, killing him instantly. Because of the accuracy of Private > First Class Muranaga's previous fire, the enemy soldiers decided not to risk > further exposure and immediately abandoned their position. Private First > Class Muranaga's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping > with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on > him, his unit, and the United States Army.Gomez-Granger, Julissa.
