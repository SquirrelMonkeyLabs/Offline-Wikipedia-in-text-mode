 "text": "Light therapy is a treatment where the patient is exposed to light. Depression, sleeping problems, bipolar disorder and many skin conditions are treated with this therapy. The therapy consists of exposing the patient to a light source (a table lamp, for example). The light source usually emits the full spectrum of light. Sometimes, this has to be done at a specific time of day. When it is used for skin conditions, it is usually called phototherapy. Example conditions where phototherapy is used are psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Light therapy should generally not be used, in the case the patient also suffers from certain diseases of the eyes. Certain drugs make people more sensitive to light. People taking such drugs should also not use light therapy. Category:Therapy",
