 "text": "The Pony Express was a mail delivering service started on April 3, 1860. It ended on October 26, 1861. It would normally deliver mail in about 10 days. The pony express was the best way to spread news in this time. 186 stations kept horses so when a rider's horse was tired he could trade it for a fresh one. On October 24, 1861, the telegraph was completed. It sent messages faster than the Pony Express. The Pony Express shut down shortly after the telegraph was completed. It only lasted two days after the telegraph was first made. ==References== Category:Defunct companies of the United States Category:1860 establishments in the United States Category:1861 disestablishments Category:United States Postal Service",
