 "text": "A pilgrimage is when people travel to a place of worship that is usually far away. They may have to go to a different city or country. Usually a pilgrimage is done for spiritual or religious reasons. The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by Pope Benedict XVI this way: There are also non- religious pilgrimages; they include for example: * Seeing the Mausoleum of Vladimir Lenin on the Red Square in Moscow, or * Visiting the birthplace of Elvis Presley.
