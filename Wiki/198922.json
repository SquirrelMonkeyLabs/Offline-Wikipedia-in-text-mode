Omar and Cedric had earlier played in another rock band called At the Drive-In, but the band did not want to play anymore since they liked different types of music. They have released five studio albums, some of them on the record label Universal. They are famous for their wild live shows, their psychedelic sounds and their concept albums. In September 2012, the band announced that they were going on a hiatus and then split up January 2013.
