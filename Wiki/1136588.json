The main function of the AR924 is to allow fast, direct and efficient communication through text alerts. The ability to receive signals at a distance is used strategically by users who need to communicate where the signal from telephone devices does not reach. Some 5,000 AR924 pagers were bought by a terror organization Hezbollah on dark market during the 2023 war with Israel. In September 2024, the pagers exploded almost simultaneously in Lebanon killing 12 and injuring about 3000 Hezbollah senior terrorists, rendering them useless for future operation. According to a statement published by Gold Apollo on their web page on 18 September 2024, they are not the manufacturer of the device and had instead licensed the brand to the Hungarian company BAC Consulting. == Features == The PC-programmable and hand-programmable pager is equipped with 4 buttons with two-way scrolling, a 4 lines LCD screen, and a removable lithium battery, rechargeable via a USB-C connector, and lasting up to 85 days with 2.5 hours of charging. The AR924 allows the user to store up to 30 messages with a maximum length of 100 characters. Its data transfer rate is 512/1200/2400 bit/s for POCSAG. == Sales == The AR924 model is not available for sale in Taiwan nor the United States. More broadly, direct exports of Gold Apollo-manufactured pagers from Taiwan amount to some 260,000 sets between the start of 2022 and August 2024 (including over 40,000 between January and August 2024), mostly to the United States, Hong Kong and Australia, according to Taiwan's Ministry for Economic Affairs. The ministry's figures recorded no direct exports of any Gold Apollo-manufactured pagers from Taiwan to Lebanon during the same period, however indirect exports via third parties could not be ruled out. == Speculation on Israel for manufacturing and explosions in Lebanon == A wide spread speculation was heard about Israeli intelligence personnel manufactured the pagers, with special versions designed especially for and shipped to Hezbollah included with explosives in the battery, as a dooms-day weapon against the terror group in . On 17 September 2024, some 5,000 AR924 pagers exploded almost simultaneously in Lebanon and parts of Syria, at around 3:30 pm local time, killing 12 and injuring over 2,750 Hezbollah senior members. The explosions appeared to be a co-ordinated attack against the terror organization, that started a war against Israel on 8 October 2023 in solidarity with the terror attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023 against Israel. The terror group is also a Lebanese Shia political party and paramilitary group officially not part of the Lebanese army, but yet having more fire power than some regional countries. officially not reportedly, some 500 Hezbollah members lost their eyesight, including Iranian ambassador to Lebanon - however, no further elaboration on this number was provided, nor the official statement for the ambassador injury case. Initially-circulated photos of the damaged pagers showed components displaying the logo of Gold Apollo, leading to feverish online speculation that the pagers involved had originated from its factories in Taiwan. The following day, Gold Apollo founder Hsu Ching-Kuang told reporters in Taiwan that the company did not manufacture the pagers involved in the explosions, but that they were made by its long-term partner, the Hungary-based company BAC Consulting KFT, under a license that had been in place for three years.\"Taiwan's Gold Apollo Says Hezbollah Pagers Made By Hungary Partner,\" Barrons.\"Taiwanese Company Disavows Links to Exploding Pagers in Lebanon and Syria,\" Time.

DW which investigated BAC's official address in Budapest could not find any employees, resulting in speculation of it being a shell company. Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, the CEO of BAC Consultancy denied they manufactured the devices claiming them to be intermediaries. == Related pages == * ==References== Category:Electronics",
