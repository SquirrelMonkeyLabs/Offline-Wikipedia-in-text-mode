 "text": "The Chigi vase is a Proto-Corinthian olpe (pitcher). It is the name vase of the Chigi Painter.Amyx 1988, 31–33, and Benson, Earlier Corinthian Workshops, 1989, 56–58, call the artist the Chigi Painter. However, Dunbabin and Robertson, \"Some Protocorinthian Vase Painters\", Annual of the British School at Athens, 48, 1953, 179–180 favour the appellation \"Macmillan Painter\". It was found in an Etruscan tomb. This tomb was at Monte Aguzzo, near Veio. It was found in 1881.Ghirardini 1882, p. 292. The vase was probably made from 650–640 BC.Hurwitt, p. 3, note 12, lists the competing views on the date. The vase is now in the National Etruscan Museum, Villa Giulia, Rome (inv. No.22679). The vase is 26 cm (10.2 inches) tall. This is small, compared to other Greek vases. About 3/4 of the vase was not destroyed. The vase was found with many other potsherds. There was also a bucchero found next to it. It had writings in 2 early Etruscan alphabets. The writings talked about the ownership of Atianai.Hurwitt, 2002, p. 6. ==References== ==Sources== *D. A.
