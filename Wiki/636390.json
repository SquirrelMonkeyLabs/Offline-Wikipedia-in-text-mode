They tried to kill her in the woods to impress the internet character Slenderman, so that way he would not kill their families and allow them to become his servants. She survived, and was found by a cyclist. Weier was sentenced to up to 25 years in a mental hospital, and Geyser was sentenced to up to 40.Source == See also == * Murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart == References == Category:2014 crimes Category:2014 in the United States Category:2010s crimes in the United States Category:2010s in Wisconsin Category:May 2014 events Category:Violence in the United States",
