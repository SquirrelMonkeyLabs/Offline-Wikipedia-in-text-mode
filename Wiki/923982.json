The school was the site of forced desegregation in 1957 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional three years before. This was during the height of the civil rights movement. It has since been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and named as a U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Historic Site. ==References== Category:High schools in Arkansas Category:Little Rock, Arkansas",
