 "text": "The Cheshire cat is a character from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, a famous novel written by Lewis Carroll in 1865. The cat is known for its unique grin and its ability to disappear gradually (leaving behind only that grin). The phrase \"grin like a Cheshire cat\" existed before Carroll's novel, though historians do not know where the expression came from. In the time since Carroll published his novel, the concept of the cheshire cat has gained popularity. It is sometimes used in science to describe certain phenomena. The Cheshire cat appears in the 2010 film Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton. ==References== Category:Fictional cats",
