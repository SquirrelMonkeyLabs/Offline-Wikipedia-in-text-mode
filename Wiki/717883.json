 "text": "ita bags or \"It bags\" began mostly after the Second World War. They became popular and more common in the 1990s. The idea was led by the famous fashion houses, such as Herm√®s, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton. Their popularity was fuelled by more women having surplus money, and being competitive. Like expensive perfumes, designer bags provide a way for fashion houses to increase income by expanding their range of products. They have become an influential part of the fashion culture. By 2008 the popularity of the \"It bag\" was reported to be in decline. In May 2011, although there would always be customers for expensive status bags, Celia Walden reported that the concept of the must-have \"It bag\" was no longer in fashion. == References == == Other sources== *The Tassen Museum is a museum of bags in Amsterdam.
