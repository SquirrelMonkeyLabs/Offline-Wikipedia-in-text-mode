It was released in December 2017 for Android and iOS platforms. As of 2023, Free Fire had surpassed 187 million active users. In September 2021, Garena released Free Fire Max, a graphically improved version of the game with improved textures, lighting, and sound effects. In September 2023, Garena plans to introduce Free Fire India, a special version of the game customized specifically for the Indian audience. It was originally set to be launched on 5 September 2023, but Garena postponed the date to 25 September citing that they are improving the gameplay. ==Gameplay== The game features two main game modes: Battle Royale and Clash Squad. In Battle Royale, 50 players are dropped onto an island where they search for weapons, resources, and supplies. The goal is to be the last player or team standing. As the game progresses, a shrinking safe zone forces players into close combat, making the battle intense. The battle royale mode usually takes 15 minutes to complete a game. Clash Squad is a team-based mode where two teams of 4 players fight each other until one of the team wins 4 rounds and has 8 billion active users. ==Collaborations== Free Fire has collaborated with various artists and brands to introduce exclusive in-game content, including partnerships with DJ Alok, Cristiano Ronaldo, Justin Beiber and BTS. These collaborations have brought unique character skins, emotes, and other items to the game. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official Website Category:2017 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Battle royale games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Third-person shooters",
