 "text": "The 2020 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup was supposed to be the 10th time they held this football championship for young women's teams. It happens every two years, and it includes teams of players under the age of 20 from different countries who are part of FIFA. Originally, they planned to have the tournament in August/September 2020, hosted by Costa Rica and Panama. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they had to change their plans. FIFA announced on 3rd April 2020 that they would postpone and reschedule the tournament. Later, on 12th May 2020, FIFA decided to hold the tournament between 20th January and 6th February 2021, depending on the situation with the pandemic. Panama decided not to co-host the event due to COVID-19 concerns, so Costa Rica became the sole host. Unfortunately, on 17th November 2020, FIFA announced that they had to cancel the 2020 edition of the tournament because of the ongoing pandemic. Instead, they chose Costa Rica to host the next edition of the tournament in 2022. In the previous edition, Japan was the defending champion, as they had won their first title in 2018. == Qualified teams == Confederation Qualifying tournament Team Appearance (planned) Last appearance Previous best performance AFC 2019 AFC U-19 Women's Championship 7th 2018 (2018) 8th 2018 (2006, 2016) 6th 2016 (2010) CAF 2020 African U-20 Women's World Cup Qualifying Tournament N/A N/A CONCACAF Host nation 3rd 2014 (2010, 2014) ~~~~~~1st~~ None ~~Debut~~ 2020 CONCACAF Women's U-20 Championship 9th 2018 (2010, 2012, 2016) 10th 2018 (2002, 2008, 2012) N/A CONMEBOL 2020 South American U-20 Women's Championship N/A N/A OFC 2019 OFC U-19 Women's Championship 8th 2018 (2014) UEFA 2019 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship 8th 2018 (2016) 10th 2018 (2004, 2010, 2014) 2nd 2018 (2018) 4th 2018 (2018) ; Notes == References == Category:2020 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup Category:2020 in association football",
