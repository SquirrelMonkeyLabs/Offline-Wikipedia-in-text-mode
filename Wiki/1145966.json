 "text": "A digital library (also called an online library or an internet library) is a place where digital objects are kept. These objects can be text, images, audio, video, or other digital media. Digital libraries can be accessed through the internet. == History == The idea of digital libraries has roots in the 1960s and 1970s, when early efforts were made to digitize library collections and make them accessible electronically. The term \"digital library\" was popularized by the NSF/DARPA/NASA Digital Libraries Initiative in 1994. == Features == Digital libraries store digital content. This content can be digitized (scanned from physical items) or created digitally. They help people find and use information easily. Digital libraries can be very large or small and can be managed by individuals or organizations. == Examples == Some well-known digital libraries are: * Project Gutenberg * Google Books * Internet Archive == Benefits == Digital libraries have many benefits: * They are easy to access from anywhere with an internet connection. * They can store a lot of information in a small space. * They help preserve rare and old items by digitizing them. == Challenges == Digital libraries also face challenges: * Keeping digital content safe and accessible over time. * Ensuring that everyone can access the digital content, including people with disabilities. == References == Category:Libraries Category:Information technology",
