 "text": "The molar heat capacity of a substance is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one mole of it by one degree Celsius. When using SI units, it can be calculated with the equation c_n = \\frac Q {\\Delta T} where c_n refers to the molar heat capcity (in joules per Kelvin), Q to the heat supplied (in joules) and \\Delta T (in Kelvin) to the temperature change in the substance. The molar heat capacity of a given substance can be found by heating the substance by releasing a known amount of energy into the substance and measuring the temperature change. For example, a common school experiment to find the molar heat capacity of water involves heating a beaker of water with an immersion heater (that can display the heat released in joules on a display) and stirring the water, while checking the temperature at specific intervals. For more accurate results, a bomb calorimeter can be used; these contain a chamber of fuel (in this case, a compound that will release heat when needed) inside a chamber of water, with the water chamber protected by heat-proof walls (to ensure minimal heat loss, which would affect the final heat capacity recorded). ==References== Category:Energy",
