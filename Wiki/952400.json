 "text": "Strecker's chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri) is a frog. It lives in the United States. It lives in Oklahoma and parts of Kansas, Texas, and Louisiana. Scientists think it might also live in Utah. This is the largest frog is the genus Pseudacris. The adult can be 48 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the back may be brown, gray, or green. It has a dark stripe from its eyes to its body. It has dark spots on its back and a white belly. The skin where the back legs meet the body is orange-yellow in color. This frog looks for food at night. During the day, it digs in the ground and hides under soil or wet leaves. Most frogs dig with their back legs, but this frog digs with its front legs. This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings build things in the places where the frog lives and cut down trees for wood. However, a subspecies of this frog, Pseudacris streckeri illinoiensis, is endangered. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
