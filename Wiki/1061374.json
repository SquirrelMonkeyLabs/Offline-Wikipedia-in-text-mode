 "text": "The WAGR L class were a total of 27 diesel-electric locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1967 to 2000. The L class were built from 1967 to 1973 by Clyde Engineering of Granville, Sydney, New South Wales and Eagle Farm, Brisbane, Queensland as well as Commonwealth Engineering of Rocklea, Brisbane, Queensland. They were introduced onto the Eastern Goldfields Railway, and at the time were the largest locomotive operated by a government railway system. The L class initially served on iron ore traffic from Koolyanobbing to Kwinana. They also ran the Indian Pacific, however after discovering the damage the class posed to the track at higher speeds, they were promptly removed from passenger trains altogether. Withdrawals began in 1997, with multiple being sold off until 2000 when Westrail itself was sold off. 8 L class have been scrapped with 15 withdrawn, and 3 remaining in service. == Gallery == File:WAGR diesel locomotive L270 heading the west-east Indian Pacific train in the Avon valley, Feb 1970.jpg|link=|No. 270 (later Pacific National Red Dwarf) passing through Avon valley with the Indian Pacific in 1970.
