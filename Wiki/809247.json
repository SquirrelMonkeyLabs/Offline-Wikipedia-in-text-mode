Since there was no political freedom in Iran, every political organization and even small student circles had to go into hiding and organize underground. Komala was no exception. Like all other opposition organizations of that time, especially the leftist groups of the sixties and seventies, Komala faced severe repression.N. Entessar: Kurdish Politics in the Middle East, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc. Oxford (o.a.) 2020, p. 50 During those years many of Komala's members and its leadership experienced persecution, torture and imprisonment in the hands of SAVAK, Shah’s notorious secret police, but Komala managed to survive and protect the main body of its organization and its growing network of activists. More than 9 years of hard and disciplined work prior to the outbreak of Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, bore its fruit and helped Komala build a strong and cohesive body of cadres among sections of Kurdish society. Komala managed to win over considerable amounts of Kurdish students, teachers, intellectuals and young people and to develop a significant influence and social base among workers and peasants throughout Kurdistan.NRC Holland Komala actively participated in the Iranian Revolution and in fact was behind almost every demonstration and popular movement of that period. On March 16, 1979, a few days after the victory of the Revolution, Komala launched an open political party. By this time Komala had already become a major political force in Iranian Kurdistan. The birth of Komala and its rapid growth among large sections of Kurdish society in Iran, apart from its own hard work, discipline and dedication, can be attributed to a combination of social factors during a period of Iran’s transition from a traditional and patriarchal society to a so-called pseudo-modern one. == Ideology == After a long and heated debate among its ranks and in public during the 1990s, finally the majority of the Komala Party’s cadres and members decided on a renewal programme to adapt to new domestic and global developments. Since year 2000, Komala Party has undergone a major overhaul. This move was welcomed by the great majority of people, intellectuals, students, women, civil activists, Komala veteran activists and others.Conflict, Democratization, and the Kurds in the Middle East: Turkey, Iran While preserving its socialist values, Komala fights for Kurdish rights, a democratic secular pluralist federal Iran, social justice,ekurd.net democratic labour laws, the freedom of assembly and organization, political freedoms, democracy, human rights, women’s rights and cultural and religious tolerance. == International Affiliation == Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan is currently a consultative member of the International Socialist, a worldwide organization for progressive forces including social democrats, socialists and labor parties to gather under.
