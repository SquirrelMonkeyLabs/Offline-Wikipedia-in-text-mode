After the death of Victor Hubinon in 1979, Lorg and his father made the drawings for the comic series Redbeard. Lorg also made contributions to the last Jan Kordaat-album of Jijé. He also drew two reeditions of the comic book Christophe Colomb, about explorer Christopher Columbus. These were Christophe Colomb - Premier voyage (1992) and Christophe Colomb - La trahison (1993), for which he made the drawings and screenplay. Gillain decided not to continue as a cartoonist and became a furniture designer for Eugène Sart in Montauban. He died on 25 November 2022 at the age of 66 years. ==References== Category:Belgian artists Category:Cartoonists Category:1956 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Place of death missing",
