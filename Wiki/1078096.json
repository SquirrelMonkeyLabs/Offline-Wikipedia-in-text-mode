 "text": "Glencoe, also known as Gleanna Comhann or A' Chàrnaich in Scottish Gaelic, is a town situated in the west of Scotland at the mouth of the River Coe into Loch Leven, near Invercoe. It is located in the northwest of the valley named Glencoe. In terms of local politics, Glencoe belongs to the county of Argyll in the Highland administrative region. Historically part of Lochaber, the village is now referred to as Glencoe Village to distinguish it from the Glen Coe valley. It is close to the site of the Glencoe massacre in the 1690s, where members of the MacDonalds and Henderson clans were ordered to be killed by King William III under the leadership of Robert Campbell of Glenlyon. While Glencoe is not in the valley itself, it is on an area called Carnoch. Linguistically, the locals refer to the village as A'Chàrnaich, meaning \"Square of the Cairns\" in Scottish Gaelic. Originally founded on the north bank of the Coe in 1850, the village has shifted to the south bank near the river bridge. Glencoe has Saint Mary's Church and a small museum, with the village being dominated by the prominent summit of the Pap of Glencoe. Known for its skiing and hiking opportunities, Glencoe attracts tourists who are also drawn to the nearby valley with its historical significance and the high ridges of the Aonach Eagach. The village includes a memorial commemorating the Glencoe massacre. Category:Towns in Highland",
