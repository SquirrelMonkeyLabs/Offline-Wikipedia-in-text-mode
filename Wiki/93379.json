On November 1, 2003 the district was renamed from Erftkreis to Rhein-Erft-Kreis. ==Geography== The main river in the district is the Erft, which also gave it the name. The Erft flows through the foothills of the Eifel, on the left side of the Rhine river. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows the lion of J端lich in the left half, as most of the area belonged to the duchy of J端lich. The right side shows the Cologne cross, which stands for the former Cologne district. On top the Erft river is depicted; the Prussian Rhine Province had the same symbol in its coat of arms. ==Towns and municipalities== Towns Towns Municipalities # Bedburg # Bergheim # Br端hl # Erftstadt 5.
