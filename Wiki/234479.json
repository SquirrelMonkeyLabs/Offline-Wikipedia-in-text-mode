 "text": "Base isolation is a collection of a buildingâ€™s units resting on its foundation to provide separation of the building from shaking ground thus improving seismic performance. ==Basic parts of base isolation system== Base isolation system consists of isolation units with or without isolation components, where: 1\\. Isolation units are the basic elements of base isolation system which provide the mentioned separation effect to a building structure. 2\\. Isolation components are the connections between isolation units and other parts of the building having no separation effect of their own. ==Famous base- isolated buildings== File:2008-1226-Pasadena-003-CityHall.jpg|Pasadena City Hall, California File:Sfcityhall.jpeg|San Francisco City Hall, California File:Salt lake city county bldg.jpg|Salt Lake City and County Building, Utah ==History== From the very beginning, the theory of base isolation rested on two pillars: heavy damping and frequency separation. Unfortunately, nobody paid any attention that the heavy damping was a sort of a strong connection between a substructure and superstructure, and that the idea of decoupling them with the help of such connections was of no good. Anyway, to virtually test-drive any design concept of base isolation, some online help is available now. Category:Earthquake engineering",
