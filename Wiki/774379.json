 "text": "Squaw is a term historically used in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, to refer to Indigenous women, primarily those of the Algonquian and Iroquoian language groups. However, the term has been widely recognized as derogatory and offensive, stemming from its use as a racial and sexist slur. == Historic usage == The word \"squaw\" comes from the Algonquian languages, where it means \"woman.\" In the Massachusetts language, the word is \"squàw.\" In Cree, it is \"iskwew.\" The term \"squaw\" has a complex and contentious history. In the historical context of European colonization in the United States and Canada, Indigenous women were subject to exploitation and objectification by European men, who frequently engaged in sexual abuse and disregarded their humanity. The term was utilized by these men as a derogatory epithet, reflecting a dehumanizing perspective that portrayed Indigenous women solely as objects of sexual gratification rather than individuals deserving of respect. The term accrued connotations that reinforced negative stereotypes of Indigenous women, depicting them as unclean, sexually abused, violent, or relegated to menial labor. Scholars have highlighted the pervasive nature of the \"squaw\" stereotype, ranking it as the second most prevalent stereotype of Native American women, juxtaposed with the romanticized archetype of the Indian princess. This binary construction perpetuated harmful myths, portraying the princess as beautiful and morally upright while depicting the squaw as unattractive, debased, and sexually available. Indigenous communities assert that the perpetuation of the \"squaw\" stereotype served the interests of white colonizers by denigrating Indigenous cultures. By portraying Indigenous societies as inherently flawed and characterized by gender-based exploitation, colonizers justified their own actions of cultural erasure and subjugation. This narrative facilitated the justification of colonial violence and dispossession under the guise of \"civilizing\" Indigenous peoples, while obscuring the systemic injustices perpetrated against them. == Modern usage == Within Indigenous communities, there exists a prevailing sentiment regarding the offensiveness of the term \"squaw.\" As articulated by representatives of the Nooksack Tribal Council, there is a widely held belief among Native Americans that \"squaw\" carries derogatory connotations. This perception underscores a broader consensus within Indigenous populations regarding the pejorative nature of the term. Conversely, there are voices within Indigenous communities advocating for the reclamation of the term \"squaw,\" advocating for its normalization within discourse. This perspective advocates for the semantic rehabilitation of the word, seeking to strip it of its derogatory associations and reintegrate it into common usage. The origin of \"squaw\" is in some compound words in Algonquin languages that are spoken today: \"nidobaskwa\" means \"female friend,\" \"manigebeskwa\" means \"woman of the woods,\" and \"Squaw Sachem\" means \"female chief.\" == Places using \"squaw\" as a name == In recent years, there have been concerted efforts to remove the term \"squaw\" from geographical features, landmarks, and other public spaces due to its offensive nature. Numerous places across North America have undergone renaming processes to replace \"squaw\" with more respectful and accurate Indigenous names. These efforts reflect a broader movement towards decolonization and cultural sensitivity. Country of Place Location of Place Usage of \"Squaw\" Type of Place Status Notes Phoenix, Arizona Squaw Peak Mountain Renamed In 2003, Squaw Peak was renamed to Piestewa Peak to honor Pfc. Lori Piestewa, the first Native American woman to die in combat in the Iraq War. Buffalo, New York Squaw Island Island Renamed In 2015, the island underwent a name change to Unity Island following a petition led by Jodi Lynn Maracle, a Mohawk resident of Buffalo, along with members of the Seneca Nation of New York. They argued that the previous name was racially insensitive and disrespectful towards Native American women. Everson, Washington Squaw Creek Stream Renamed In 2020, Washington State officials agreed to rename \"Squaw Creek\" to \"Páatstel Creek\" at the request of the Nooksack Tribal Council, aligning with efforts to remove offensive place names and honor indigenous culture. Saskatchewan, Canada Squaw Rapids Dam Hydroelectric Dam Renamed In 1988, Squaw Rapids Dam was changed to the E.B. Campbell Dam in honor of an engineer named E.B. Campbell. This renaming likely stemmed from a recognition of Campbell's contributions or to eliminate a term that was considered derogatory or culturally insensitive. Saskatchewan, Canda Killsquaw Lake Lake Renamed In 2018, Killsquaw Lake in Saskatchewan was renamed Kikiskitotawânawak Iskêwak, meaning \"we honor the women\" in Cree, commemorating a 19th-century massacre of Cree women. This change reflects efforts to acknowledge and address the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. ==References== Category:First Nations Category:English profanity Category:Pejoratives Category:Slurs",
