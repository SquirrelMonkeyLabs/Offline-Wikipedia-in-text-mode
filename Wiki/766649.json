 "text": "The Finnish alphabet has 29 letters. They are: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, Å, Ä and Ö. The letters Š and Ž, which are only used in borrowed words, are almost never used and not a part of the Finnish alphabet. Instead, they are seen as different forms of S and Z. The letter G only occurs in original Finnish words in the combination NG, not by itself. The letters B, C and F only occur in newly borrowed words, and thus were not part of the Finnish alphabet until recent times. The letters Q, W, X, Z and Å, along with the Š and Ž, are only used in borrowed words from different languages and are almost absent in Finnish. Category:Finnish language Category:Alphabets",
