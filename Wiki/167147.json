 "text": "Frederick William II (; 25 September 1744 – 16 November 1797) was King of Prussia from 1786 until his death in 1797. He was also the prince-elector of Brandenburg and (through the Orange-Nassau inheritance of his grandfather) sovereign prince of the Canton of Neuchâtel. As a defensive reaction to the French Revolution, Frederick William II ended the German Dualism between Prussia and Austria. Domestically, he turned away from the enlightened style of government of his predecessor and introduced a tightened system of censorship and religious control. The king was an important patron of the arts especially in the field of music. As a skilled cellist he enjoyed the dedication of various cellocentric compositions by composers Mozart, Haydn, Boccherini, and Beethoven. He was also responsible for some of the most notable architecture in Prussia, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Marble Palace, and Orangery in the New Garden, Potsdam. == Ancestry == === Children === Frederick William II had the following children: * By his first cousin Duchess Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel: ** Princess Frederica Charlotte (7 May 1767 – 6 August 1820), who became Duchess of York and Albany by her marriage to Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, no issue * By Princess Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt: ** Frederick William III (3 August 1770 – 7 June 1840), married Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, had issue ** Princess Christine (31 August 1772 – 14 June 1773) died in infancy ** Prince Louis Charles (5 November 1773 – 28 December 1796), married Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, had issue ** Princess Wilhelmine (18 November 1774 – 12 October 1837), who became Queen of the Netherlands by her marriage to King William I of the Netherlands, had issue ** Princess Augusta (1 May 1780 – 19 February 1841), who became Electress of Hesse by her marriage to William II, Elector of Hesse, had issue ** Prince Henry (30 December 1781 – 12 July 1846) ** Prince William (3 July 1783 – 28 September 1851), married Princess Maria Anna of Hesse-Homburg, had issue === References === |- Category:1744 births Category:1797 deaths Category:18th- century kings of Prussia Category:18th-century German musicians Category:People from Berlin Category:Kings of Prussia Category:Prince-electors of Brandenburg Category:Princes of Neuchâtel Category:House of Hohenzollern Category:18th-century German landowners Category:German Calvinist and Reformed Christians Category:18th-century Dutch politicians Category:Burials at Berlin Cathedral Category:Rosicrucians Category:Prussian people of the Kościuszko Uprising Category:Honorary members of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences Category:Conservatism in Germany Category:Brandenburgian nobility Category:German patrons of the arts Category:German cellists Category:German military leaders of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Bigamists Category:People of the War of the First Coalition",
