It's located between Lexington and Louisville. Frankfort is beside the Kentucky River. This is how the city earned its name, because the land was owned by pioneer Stephen Frank. First called \"Frank's Ford\", the name was soon shortened to Frankfort. Within a century the population of Frankfort grew from 9,487 in 1900, to 27,741 in 2000. The population was 28,602 in 2020. The members of the city commission and the mayor are elected by the citizens. ==References== == Other websites == * City of Frankfort Website Category:State capitals in the United States Category:Cities in Kentucky Category:County seats in Kentucky",
