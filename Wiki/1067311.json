 "text": "The Speed Force is a fictional cosmic energy field and force based around velocity and movement, and one of the Seven Forces of the Universe. It appears in publications by DC Comics, mostly in Flash stories. It is the representation of reality in motion, being the very cosmic force that pushes space and time forward. It grants all speedsters their power. Several speedsters have merged with it, including Barry Allen, Johnny Quick, and Max Mercury. Eobard Thawne stated that at its core, the Speed Force is equivalent to time itself, describing it as existence moving through reality, kinetic energy, and temporal energy. It first appeared in The Flash (vol. 2) #91 (June 1994), and was created by Mark Waid. Category:DC Comics",
