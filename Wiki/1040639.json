One ronnabyte holds 1000 yottabytes (YB) or an octillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes. 1000 ronnabytes make up 1 quettabyte. A ronnabyte is so large that it would take about 2 trillion supercomputers to store this amount of data. Category:Computer science Category:Units of information",
