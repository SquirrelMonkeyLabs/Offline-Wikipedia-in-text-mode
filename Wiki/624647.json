 "text": "In chemistry, a saturated compound is a chemical compound which can't usually do addition reactions, such as hydrogenation, oxidative addition, and the binding of a Lewis base. Therefore an unsaturated compound is the opposite. Saturated compounds are compounds like alkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons contain only carbon to carbon single bonds. Unsaturated compounds are compounds like alkenes or alkynes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain a carbon to carbon double bond, or carbon to carbon triple bond.
