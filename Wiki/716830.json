The protests began on 3 October 2019, as taxi, bus and truck drivers came out in protest against the planned fuel subsidy abolition. Indigenous peoples groups joined the protests shortly thereafter, along with university students and labour unions. The protesters declared their plan to hold an indefinite general strike, which would last until the government overturned its decision. President Moreno declared a state of emergency on October 4, 2019, amid nationwide protests against a hike in fuel prices. The protests had weakened the country's transport network with all major roads and bridges blocked in the capital Quito.Ecuador protests: State of emergency declared as fuel subsidies end Shortly thereafter, President Lenín Moreno refused to discuss a potential reversal of the fuel plans and called protesting crowds as \"criminals\". On 8 October 2019, President Moreno said his government had relocated to the coastal city of Guayaquil after anti-government protesters had overrun the capital Quito. On the same day, President Moreno accused his predecessor Rafael Correa of creating a coup against the government with the help of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, a charge which Correa denied.Ecuador moves government out of capital as violent protests rageEx-Ecuador president Correa denies planning coup attempt from exile During the late-night hours of 13 October, the Ecuadorian government and CONAIE reached an agreement during a televised negotiation.
