 "text": "HLN (formerly \"CNN Headline News\") is an American basic cable and satellite television channel. It is owned by CNN, a unit of the Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) division of WarnerMedia. It was first broadcast on television in 1982 as CNN2. The name was changed in 2008 to \"HLN\". This followed a pattern by Turner properties changing from their full names to acronyms. Turner Broadcasting System was changed to TBS, Turner Network Television became TNT, etc. It still runs quick news reports 24/7. It still has more headline news than its true crime shows. == References == Category:American television networks Category:Time Warner Category:Companies based in Atlanta Category:1982 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)",
