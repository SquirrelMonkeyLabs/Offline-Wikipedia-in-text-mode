 "text": "An evacuation slide is an inflatable slide used to evacuate an aircraft quickly. An escape slide is required on all passenger-carrying aircraft if the door is too high for passengers to step down from the aircraft uninjured. Federal Aviation Administration requires slides on doors where the floor is or more above the ground. Some slides are designed to act also as life rafts if the plane lands in the water.
