It also can hunt and smell very well. In its native Morocco it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has found by sniffing it out. == Other websites == * Breed Details from THE AMERICAN RARE BREED ASSOCIATION Category:Dog breeds Category:FCI breeds Category:Working dogs",
