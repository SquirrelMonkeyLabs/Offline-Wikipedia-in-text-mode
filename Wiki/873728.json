 "text": ".kkrieger (from Krieger, German for warrior) is a first-person shooter video game made by German demogroup .theprodukkt (previously part of Farbrausch). The game won first place in the 96k game competition at Breakpoint in April 2004 and is in beta. ==Development== The game has been made since mid-2002 using .werkkzeug3, an unreleased version of .werkkzeug (from Werkzeug, German for tool). The source code of .werkkzeug3 was released in 2014. It can use the BSD license or be public domain.werkkzeug3 on github.com ==Generation== Textures are quite small, using creation history, not single pixels. Basic shapes such as boxes and cylinders are modeled into other shapes. How both are loaded at the same time takes a long time. Most popular first-person shooters filled one or more CDs or DVDs at the time, but the game uses 97,280 bytes, over 7,000 times less than a CD (700MB), or 55,000 times less than an Unreal Tournament 2004 installation (5.5GB). That game normally comes on a DVD. .kkrieger's developers say storing it normally would use about 200â€“300 MB. The V2 synthesizer streams the game music and sounds using MIDI. ==Reception== The game won two German game developer prizes at the Deutscher Entwicklerpreis in 2006: Innovation and Advancement. Gaming website Acid-Play gave the game 2/5 stars and a mixed review, saying it was buggy, but liking how a lot was stored in the small file size. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official .kkrieger website (via Internet Archive) *.kkrieger on MobyGames *.kkrieger source code on GitHub *Documentation about .kkrieger on YouTube Category:2004 video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Science fiction video games Category:Windows games",
