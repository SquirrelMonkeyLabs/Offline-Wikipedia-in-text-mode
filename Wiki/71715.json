 "text": "Bugs Bunny is an Academy Award-winning animated tuxedo rabbit who starred in the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series created by Warner Bros. He made the iconic quote \"What's Up, Doc?\" popular as early as 1940. Other things he says are \"I knew I shoulda taken that left turn at Albuquerque\", \"Of course you realize, this means war\", and \"Ain't I a stinker?\". He is often seen as a very studious character, with a carrot in his mouth. His counterpart is commonly Daffy Duck, with whom he is usually arguing. In other shorts, he comes up against Wile E. Coyote, Elmer Fudd, or Yosemite Sam. Bugs speaks Bronx/Brooklyn/Flat Bush/Jersey/New York with an Bronx/Brooklyn/Flat Bush/Jersey/New York accent, causing him to drop his \"Rs\". Bugs is somewhat based on the comedian Groucho Marx. Bugs is one of a dozen cartoon characters to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; he was the second after Mickey Mouse. ==Appearances== * Transylvania 6-5000 (1963) -- (Main role) * Yakety Yak, Take it Back (1991) -- (Supporting role) * Trash Talk (1992) -- (Minor role) * Space Jam (1996) -- (Main role) * Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003) -- (Main role) * Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021) -- (Main role) Further reading * * * Chuck Amuck : The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist by Chuck Jones, published by Farrar Straus & Giroux, * * ==Other websites== * Warner Bros.
