 "text": "Classical Latin is the form of Latin that was used by the Ancient Romans in official Roman records, the Roman army, and Latin literature. Its use helped the Golden Age of Latin literature, during the 1st century BC and the early 1st century AD. Classical Latin is a dead language, as is Vulgar Latin, the common speech of citizens in the Roman Empire. Latin is no longer spoken as a first language, but it is still spoken by church officials in the Vatican, where it is the official language. Category:Ancient Rome Category:Latin language",
