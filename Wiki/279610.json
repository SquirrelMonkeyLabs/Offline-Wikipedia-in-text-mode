 "text": "Brewing is the process of making beer. It is usually made in a brewery, though it can be made at home. It is made by adding yeast that ferment malt, barley or sugar into a large vat. Ethanol is produced by yeasts using up the energy from the mixture (which the yeasts digest into glucose) because there is no oxygen in the vat. ==References==",
