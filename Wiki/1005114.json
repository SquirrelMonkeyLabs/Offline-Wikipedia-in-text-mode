 "text": "A Myojin Taisha is a Shinto shrine dedicated to a powerful kami believed to possess remarkable abilities. These shrines are considered \"great shrines\" or \"taisha\" under the ancient system of shrine rankings. Myojin Taisha shrines are found throughout Japan, particularly in the Kyoto-Osaka region, including Yamashiro, Yamato, Ōmi, Mutsu, Tajima, and Kii provinces. There are 224 shrines that enshrine 310 kami listed as Myojin Taisha in the Engishiki Jinmyocho. Additionally, there are 203 shrines with 285 kami listed for Myojinsai or \"festivals for famed deities\" in book 3 of Engishiki. While most of the shrines in these two listings overlap, there are some differences in names and numbers. There are several theories about these differences, but it is unclear why the lists differ. A related list is the Kokushi genzaisha which refers to shrines which appear in the Rikkokushi (六国史) but not in the Engishiki == Related pages == * Kokushi genzaisha shrines listed in the Rikkokushi but not in the Engishiki * Shikinai Taisha == References ==",
