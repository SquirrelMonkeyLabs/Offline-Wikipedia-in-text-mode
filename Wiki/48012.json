 "text": "New Wave (or New Wave music) is a style of rock music that developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. New wave music was inspired by the punk rock movement. New Wave music is rock music mixed with other types of music, such as punk rock music, funk, disco, ska and pop. In essence, New Wave maintained the rebellious and energetic side of punk rock, yet was less raw and aggressive. Whilst a lot of New Wave was, much New Wave was pop-based, containing simple melodies and catchy hooks. Additionally, New Wave music was also very electronic in nature, and made strong usage of synthesizers. New Wave is a broad term, and as such, New Wave artists varied greatly in style, ranging from pure rock, to synthpop, to reggae-influenced music. New Wave, as a genre, additionally had a strong visual aesthetic, and is noted for the colourful fashions which New Wave artists would sport in the 1980s. When MTV started broadcasting in 1981, many New Wave bands had their music videos played on television. This made New Wave music more popular. A well-known New Wave video is Whip It by Devo. ==Notable artists== *Blondie *The Cars *Culture Club *Elvis Costello *Devo *Duran Duran *The Go-Go's *Joe Jackson *Lene Lovich *Oingo Boingo *Spandau Ballet *Split Enz *Squeeze *The Cars *The Police *The Pretenders *Talking Heads *Kim Wilde *XTC Category:New wave Category:Rock music Category:Punk rock Category:Electronic music",
