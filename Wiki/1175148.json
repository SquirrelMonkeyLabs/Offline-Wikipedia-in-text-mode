Its population in 2024 was 208. == Location == It is located near the Bodrog River, on the right bank, within the Tokaj wine region. The neighboring settlements are: Olaszliszka to the northeast, Szegi to the south, and Erdőbénye to the northwest; in addition, to the west, its border briefly touches the uninhabited outer areas of the otherwise more distant Bodrogkisfalud. == History == The settlement was already part of the Tokaj Castle estate in the 15th century. In 1419, the Tornai family owned the village. In 1466, it belonged to the Rozgonyi family, and in 1500, Sztrithei Ozsváth and János Tárczai were partial owners. According to the 1598 census, Gábor Rákóczi and the widow of Miklós Kapy had shares here. In 1637, it belonged to the wife of Bálint Usz, and later to the Schop family. Subsequently, it became the property of the Hungarian Royal Education Fund, which owned it into the early 20th century. In the mid-19th century, Elek Fényes described Szegilong as a plain with little arable land, rich pastures, and a vineyard producing excellent wine. == Population == In 2022, 91.9% of the population identified as Hungarian, 3.8% as Roma, 0.5% each as German, Rusyn, and Romanian, and 0.9% as belonging to other non-domestic nationalities (8.1% did not declare; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%). In terms of religion, 45% were Roman Catholic, 15.2% Reformed, 9.5% Greek Catholic, 0.5% Lutheran, and 5.7% non-denominational (23.2% did not respond). == Notes == Category:Settlements in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Category:Villages in Hungary",
