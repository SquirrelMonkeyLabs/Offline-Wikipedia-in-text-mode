It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.UNESCO, \"Monticello and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville\"; retrieved 2012-4-18. ==History== Jefferson designed the house based on the principles of Andrea Palladio. Construction began in 1768. Jefferson moved in two years later. He remodelled the house after picking up ideas in Europe. The house is located on a peak in the Southwest Mountains. Its name is Italian for \"Little Mountain\". Slave quarters were located 300 feet south of the house on Mulberry Row. These quarters were occupied by slaves working in the house. The slaves working in the fields lived in another place. A cabin on Mulberry Row was once the home of Sally Hemings. She was a slave who had a long relationship with Jefferson after his wife died. She gave birth to six of his children. An image of the house has appeared on the United States nickel and on the two-dollar bill. Monticello became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It has been owned and operated by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation since 1923. == Gallery == File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|Jefferson, 1800 File:Monticello 2010-10-29.jpg|Monticello File:Monticellofromgardens.jpg|Monticello from the gardens File:Montcello 1956 Issue-20c.jpg|Postage stamp, 1956 == Panoramas == == Related pages == *List of World Heritage Sites in the United States ==References== ==Other websites== *Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, official site *The Monticello Explorer, an interactive multimedia look at the house *Thomas Jefferson Wiki *Monticello Association, private lineage society of Jefferson descendants *Tour Experience of Monticello *Jefferson's Dome at Monticello *A photographic collection of Thomas Jefferson's architecture *\"Thomas Jefferson Lived Here.\" Popular Mechanics, August 1954, pp. 97â€“103/212. *\"Life Portrait of Thomas Jefferson\", broadcast from Monticello Category:Presidential homes in the United States Category:World Heritage Sites in the United States Category:1772 establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:1770s establishments in Virginia",
