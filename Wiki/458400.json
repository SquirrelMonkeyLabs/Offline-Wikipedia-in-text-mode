 "text": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (abbreviated BJP) is one of the two major political parties in India. (The second being the Indian National Congress). The Indian Lok Sabha elections in 2024 the BJP has 240 of the 542 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India and 78 of the 238 seats in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India. Jayprakash Nadda is the national president of BJP. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani founded the party in April 1980. \"Bharatiya\" means \"Indian\" and \"Janata\" means \"People\". The BJP's political beliefs are similar to the beliefs of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh). == History == === Bharatiya Janata Party === The history of the Bharatiya Janata Party starts with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP was a political party created by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1980. At that time, the Indian National Congress was the political party that ruled India. The BJP's goal was to stop the Indian National Congress's policies. Many people thought the BJP was part of the RSS because they had the same ideologies on leading Bharat. ==== Campaign for Kashmir ==== The party's first election campaign was about Kashmir. Kashmir was an area divided between India and Pakistan(2393squareKm). The BJS wanted to make Kashmir a part of India. The party's founder, Mookerjee, was arrested for protesting in Kashmir, when he was ordered not to do so. He died in prison, so Deendayal Upadhyay became the party's leader. Even though there was slight public support for the party because of the campaign about Kashmir, the BJS only managed to win three seats in the Lok Sabha in the 1952 elections. ==== Later elections ==== In the 1967 Indian elections, many political parties, including the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, joined up together to win a majority of the seats of many Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. This was the first time the BJS had held any political office. In 1977, after the end of a State of Emergency declared by the Congress Government, BJS joined with several other parties to form BJP. In 1996 BJP became the largest party in Parliament. It did poorly in the 2004 elections and became the major opposition party. The 2014 elections gave BJP enough seats to form a government. ==References== Category:Political parties in India Category:1951 establishments in Asia Category:1950s establishments in India Category:Nationalism",
