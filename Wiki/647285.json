 "text": "Roy Harris Jenkins, Baron Jenkins of Hillhead, (11 November 1920 – 5 January 2003) was a British Labour Party, SDP and Liberal Democrat politician, and biographer of British political leaders. Jenkins was elected to Parliament as a Labour MP in 1948. He served as Home Secretary from 1965 to 1967 and Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1967 and 1970. He was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party on 8 July 1970, but resigned in 1972 because he supported entry to the European Communities, while the party opposed it. In 1977, he was appointed President of the European Commission, serving until 1981. He was the first British holder of this office, and is likely to be the only such (considering the United Kingdom's decision in June 2016 to leave the European Union). He was also a known historian, biographer and writer. His A Life at the Centre (1991) is thought to be as one of the best autobiographies of the later 20th century, which \"will be read with pleasure long after most examples of the genre have been forgotten\". ==References== ==Other websites== * * \"Roy Jenkins (The Rt Hon Lord Jenkins of Hillhead)\" , Fellows Remembered, The Royal Society of Literature Category:1920 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Abortion-rights activists Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:British biographers Category:British Army officers Category:British autobiographers Category:British military personnel of World War II Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer Category:European Commissioners Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for English constituencies Category:Members of the British House of Commons for Scottish constituencies Category:Leaders of the Social Democratic Party (UK) Category:Order of Merit Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Secretaries of State for the Home Department Category:Social Democratic Party (UK) MPs Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 Category:UK MPs 1955–1959 Category:UK MPs 1959–1964 Category:UK MPs 1964–1966 Category:UK MPs 1966–1970 Category:UK MPs 1970–1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974–1979 Category:UK MPs 1979–1983 Category:UK MPs 1983–1987 Category:Liberal Democrat Life Peers Category:Welsh politicians Category:Welsh writers",
