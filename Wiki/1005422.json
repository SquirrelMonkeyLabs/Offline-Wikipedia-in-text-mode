The adult male frog is about 77.9â€“85.8 mm long from nose to rear end. People have seen this frog in evergreen forests that have not been cut down. People saw the frogs near ponds. Scientists think its eggs hatch into tadpoles, like other eggs in Zhangixalus. People have seen this frog between 1320 and 1680 meters above sea level. This frog is in danger because people change the place where it lives. People build small farms and cut down trees to get wood. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
