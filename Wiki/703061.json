It was founded in 1985 by a professor named Otis Graham Jr. The Center describes itself as a group that is \"providing immigration policymakers, the academic community, news media, and concerned citizens with reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States.\" The Center is led by Mark Krikorian. Krikorian believes that America should have a stronger border to stop illegal immigration. == References == Category:Think tanks based in the United States Category:1986 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations in Washington, D.C.
