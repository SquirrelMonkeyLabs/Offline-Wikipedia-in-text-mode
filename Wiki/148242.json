 "text": "An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a ship made for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: the crude tanker and the product tanker. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move petrochemicals from refineries to points near consuming markets. == Bibliography == * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * * == Other websites == * Bill Willis.
