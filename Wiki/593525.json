 "text": "Escolta Street is a historic west to east street in the downtown district of Binondo in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. It is very near to (and parallel to) Pasig River. It starts at Plaza Moraga to the west and ends at Plaza Santa Cruz and Quintin Paredes Street to the east. It contains some examples of early skyscraper design in the country. The name of the street is derived from the Spanish word \"escoltar\", meaning \"to escort\" or \"to accompany\". It is known as calle de la Escolta in the Spanish language. It was built in 1594 and was the center of business and commerce in Metro Manila until the 1960s, when the center of business slowly moved to Makati. Category:Streets in Metro Manila",
