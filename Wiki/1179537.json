Both the Ottoman Turkish Janissaries and Imperial Russian Army were responsible. During one of the massacres in Galați in 1797, local Jews were forced out of their homes and killed on the streets, with some of the victim bodies dropped into the Danube. Jews who hid in a local synagogue were also burned alive. Meanwhile, Ottoman Kalmyk soldiers committed similar massacres against Jews in Bucharest in the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. ==Related pages== * Iași pogrom * Antisemitism * The Holocaust * Odessa massacre * Rhineland massacres ==References== Category:Europe Category:Racism Category:Moldova Category:Romania Category:18th century Category:19th century Category:Antisemitism Category:Jewish history Category:History of Europe Category:History of Moldova Category:History of Romania Category:18th century in Europe Category:19th century in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Europe",
