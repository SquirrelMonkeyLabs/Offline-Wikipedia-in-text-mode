He was the tenth Prime Minister of Tuvalu from 2006 to 2010, and was returned as a member of parliament in 2010. He was re-elected to parliament in 2015. On 5 October 2016, the High Court of Tuvalu declared that Ielemia’s parliamentary seat was vacant as he was not qualified to be a member of parliament, following his conviction on 6 May 2016 in the Magistrate’s Court of charges of abuse of office during the final year of his term as Prime Minister. Ielemia said he believed himself to be a member of parliament. Ielemia challenged the decision in 2017. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Prime Ministers of Tuvalu",
