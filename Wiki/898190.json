It is the main branch of the city's library. It contains more than 20,000 bibliographic units. Interlinguistically neutral (thus \"la langue internationale\"), CDELI aims to preserve documents in and about all kinds of constructed languages: it offers, in addition to Esperanto books and periodicals, the richest collections of materials about Volapük and Interlingue, among others. == Other websites== * UEA-Vikio: Switzerland * CDELI (français) * CDELI (esperanto) * CDELI (www.cdeli.org) Category:Constructed languages Category:1967 establishments in Europe Category:1960s establishments in Switzerland Category:Buildings and structures in Switzerland Category:La Chaux-de-Fonds District",
