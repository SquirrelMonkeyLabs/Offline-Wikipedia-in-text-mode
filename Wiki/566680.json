 "text": "Michael Leigh Chamberlain (27 February 1944 â€“ 9 January 2017) was a New Zealand-born Australian writer, teacher and pastor. He was best known due to the August 1980 death of his missing daughter Azaria as the result of a dingo attack while camping near Uluru in the Northern Territory, Australia. Chamberlain's then-wife Lindy was falsely convicted of the baby's murder in 1982 and he was convicted of being an accessory after the fact. The findings of a 1987 royal commission made sure that the couple was innocent, but not before they were hated by the public and negatively covered by the media. Chamberlain died on 9 January 2017 at Gosford Hospital, on the New South Wales central coast, aged 72 from complications of acute myeloid leukemia. ==References== Category:1944 births Category:2017 deaths Category:New Zealand writers Category:Australian writers Category:Australian educators Category:New Zealand educators Category:Deaths from acute myeloid leukemia",
