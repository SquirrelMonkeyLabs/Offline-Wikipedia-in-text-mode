 "text": "The Battle of Brovary was a battle that started on 9 March 2022. It was a part of the Kyiv offensive during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The battle took place near the city of Brovary. Brovary is to the east of the capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv. == Battle == On the evening of 9 March, Russian armoured vehicles were coming towards Brovary on the Highway M01. The armoured vehicles were the 6th and 239th Tank Regiments of the 90th Guards Tank Division. They were going very slowly. Some of them were very old vehicles, like T-72 tanks which were designed 49 years before the battle. They are not very good and are outdated. Also, in the front of the group of vehicles were TOS-1s. They were very vulnerable. Ukrainian forces saw this and attacked. They disabled the tanks and armored personnel carriers. The Russians retreated. This is because they had lost a large amount of soldiers and equipment. The Russian commander, Andrei Zakharov, was killed in the battle. On 12 March, Russia said that its troops disabled the Ukrainian military's main centre for communications and intelligence that were in Brovary. The mayor of Brovary, Ihor Sapozhko, however said, \"We are ready for them.\" == References == Brovary",
