 "text": "Discoid lupus erythematosus (also called discoid lupus or DLE) is an autoimmune skin condition. It is the most common type of lupus. It shows as painful, red areas of skin. Many times, it appears on the scalp, cheeks, or ears. A person can lose hair if they have DLE on their scalp.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.) Saunders. Chapter 8. . The red areas can scar and last for years if they are not treated. People with DLE can get red areas by being in the sun for too long. Doctors can find the red areas and treat them. People with DLE can be given sunscreen or steroids for their skin. If this does not work, medication can be used. A common medication for DLE is hydroxychloroquine. == References == Category:Autoimmune diseases",
