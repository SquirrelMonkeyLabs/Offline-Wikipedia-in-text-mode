 "text": "The 1945-46 Austrian football championship was the first football championship in Austria after the Second World War. It was organized by the league committee. The clubs from 1944/45 took part in the championship in 1945/46, supplemented by the leading teams from the 1st class 1944/45 SC Helfort and the successor club of Reichsbahn SG Wien (Ostbahn XI), which was allowed to take part instead of the LAC, which was resigning. Since numerous sports fields were still unusable after the war, they were matches mostly in the form of double events on the few playable places. ==Table== Pl. Name W D L P 1\\.
