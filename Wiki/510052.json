 "text": "Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom is an American amusement and water park owned and operated by Cedar Fair and located in between Allentown, Pennsylvania and Emmaus, Pennsylvania. == History == Dorney Park traces its history to 1860, when Solomon Dorney built a trout hatchery and summer resort on his estate outside of Allentown. In 1870, Dorney decided to convert the estate into a public attraction. Initially, the facility featured games, playground-style rides, refreshment stands, picnic groves, a hotel, and a restaurant. By the 1880s, Dorney had added a small zoo, and gardens. == Halloween Haunt == Halloween Haunt is an annual event that is held from September to October. The park hires around 700 people for this event. It was originally introduced in 1998 as Halloweekends, but was rebranded Halloween Haunt in 2008. === Current attractions === Halloween Haunt currently features 12 attractions including seven mazes and five scare zones, and three live mainstage shows (TBA 2024).
