 "text": "The Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) is a social animal that lives in the frigid tundra of North America, Newfoundland, and Greenland. These hares often congregate in groups of up to 200 individuals. They hop at great speeds on their large, powerful hind legs, in a kangaroo-like fashion. The female is called a doe, the male is called a buck, and the baby hare is called a leveret. The young are born open-eyed and furry. Most hares live for about a year in the wild. Their predators are arctic foxes, arctic wolves, polar bears, falcons, snowy owls, golden eagles, and stoats. They are unharmed during winter and are used to wintry weather.
