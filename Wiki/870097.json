 "text": "Al-Imran ( Arabic : آل عمران) is the third chapter of the Qur'an, with 200 verses and 20 ruku's. Surah Al-Imran was revealed in Medina. == Surah al Imran == Verses 33 to 35 of this Surah speak of \"Ali-Imran\" or \"Descendants of Imran\". Its name has been considered as a sign. (The correct pronunciation of the name of this surah is 'Ali Imran'). Imran is the grandfather of Isa (AS). == Time and content of the revelation == The first sermon starts from the first of the sura and continues till verse 32 and it was probably revealed near the battle of Badr. The second speech starts from verse 33 and ends in verse 63 (up to the end of the 6th verse). It was revealed in the 9th Hijri when the Najran delegation arrived. The third speech is from the beginning of the seventh ruku to the end of the twelfth ruku. It was revealed with the first speech. The fourth discourse continues from the thirteenth ruku 'to the end of the surah. It was revealed after the battle of Uhod. Verses: 1: Alif Lam Meem. 2: There is no god but Allah, He is the Ever-Living, the Possessor of all things. 3: He has sent down to you the Book with the truth; Which confirms the previous books. 4: The Torah and the Gospel have been sent down before this Book for the guidance of mankind, and the Revelation has been sent down. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah - for them is a severe punishment. And Allah is Mighty, Avenger. 5: Nothing in the heavens and the earth is hidden from Allah. 6: He is the God who shapes you in the womb as He wills. There is no god but Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise. 7: He is the One who sent down the Book to you. There are some clear verses in it, they are the real part of the book. And the others are metaphorical. So those who have crookedness in their hearts, They follow the metaphors in them for the purpose of spreading sedition and misinterpretation. And no one knows their interpretation except Allah. And those who are deep in knowledge say: We believe in it. All this is a revelation from our Lord. And no one receives education except those who are endowed with understanding. 8: Our Lord! Thou wilt not lead our hearts astray after Our guidance, and bestow on us grace from Thee. You are the giver of everything. 9: Our Lord! You will surely bring people together one day - there is no doubt about it. GOD does not fulfill His promise. 10: Those who disbelieve, their wealth and their children will not avail them aught against Allah. And they are the fuel of Hell. 11: The people of Pharaoh and those before them denied My revelations. As a result, GOD seized them for their sins, and GOD's retribution was severe. 12: Tell the disbelievers that they will soon be defeated and driven to Hell. What a miserable position. 13: Surely there was a sign for you between the two parties. A party fights in the way of Allah. And the other party was the disbelievers, who saw them with their own eyes. And whom Allah strengthens with His help. In the meantime, there are lessons for those who have vision. 14: - Mankind has been fascinated by women, children, zodiac gold and silver, marked horses, cattle and farms. All these are the consumables of worldly life. The best refuge is with God. 15: - Say, Shall I tell you to seek better than this? For those who guard (against evil), with Allah is Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. And pure companions, and the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is ever watchful over His servants. == Other websites == * Q3:7, 50+ translations, islamawakened.com * Al-Quran – Āl ʿImrān (The Family of Imran) * A fragment showing verses 85-88 from the World Digital Library * Quran 3 Clear Quran translation Category:Chapters in the Quran Category:Qur'an articles needing attention Category:Jesus",
