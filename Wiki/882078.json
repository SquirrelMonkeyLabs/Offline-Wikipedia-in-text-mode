Still, there are several considerable problems. == LGBT rights in Armenia == Homosexuality has been legal in Armenia since 2003. However, even though it has been decriminalized, the situation of local lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) citizens has not changed substantially. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Armenia have yet to be claimed and acquired.

There is, moreover, no legal protection for LGBT persons whose human rights are violated regularly.Armenian Gays Face Long Walk to Freedom == References == Armenia Category:Politics of Armenia",
