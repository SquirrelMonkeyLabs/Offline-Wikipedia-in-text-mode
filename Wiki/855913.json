 "text": "An undeciphered writing system is a written form of language that is currently not understood. In this context, a writing system is used to mean a series of glyphs; these glyphs may represent writing in a language. However, this is not known until they are deciphered. Not being able to decipher a text can have several reasons: * The language may be a language isolate (there are few or no similar languages that still exist) * There may be very few texts in the given language * What is considered a text in a language really is not: it may just be decorations, but the symbols have no semantic meaning. There is also the concept of false writing systems: these are constructed sets of symbols that are meant to represent a writing system, but that do not. == Examples == * Vinƒça script, from 7th or 8th century BC Europe * Dispilio Tablet, from Western Macedonia, Greece, 6th century BC * Phaistos disc, from 2nd century BC Crete. * Southwest Paleohispanic script, found on the Iberian peninsula, about 700 BC * Sitovo inscription from Bulgaria * Cascajal Block, Olmec civilization, about 9th century * Numidian language - the script has been almost entirely deciphered, but the language is unknown. * Rongorongo, inscriptions from Easter Island * The Voynich manuscript, 15th century * Singapore Stone * Newton Stone, considered to be a forgery, by many Category:Writing systems",
