 "text": "The US Open is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is played in Queens, New York City in the USA. It is run by United States Tennis Association. The tournament has been played on three different surfaces: * Grass (1881-1974) * Har-Tru (a type of clay court, 1975-1977) * Decoturf (a type of hard court, 1978-present) The tournament was first played in 1881 for men, and 1887 for women. In 2006, the U.S. Open became the first Grand Slam to use Hawk-Eye. Hawk-Eye is a machine that can give a virtual replay of the shot that has just been played - this is useful for seeing if the ball was in or out. When a player does not agree with the umpire, they can ask to use Hawk- Eye. As of 2007, the other three Grand Slams use this machine too. The US Open is the final Grand Slam of the year and is played over two weeks, in late August and early September. == Champions == === Past champions === *Men's Singles *Women's Singles *Men's Doubles *Women's Doubles *Mixed Doubles *Singles Finals === Current champions === Event Champion Runner-up Score 2016 Men's Singles Stan Wawrinka Novak Djokovic 6–7 (1), 6–4, 7–5, 6–3 2016 Women's Singles Angelique Kerber Karolína Plíšková 6–3, 4–6, 6–4 2016 Men's Doubles Jamie Murray Bruno Soares Pablo Carreño Busta Guillermo García-López 6–2, 6–3 2016 Women's Doubles Bethanie Mattek-Sands Lucie Šafářová Caroline Garcia Kristina Mladenovic 2–6, 7–6 (5), 6–4 2016 Mixed Doubles Laura Siegemund Mate Pavić Coco Vandeweghe Rajeev Ram 6–4, 6–4 == Records == * Men - Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer have won 5 times. * Women - Chris Evert has won 6 times. == Other websites == * US Open official site * US Open - All winners and runners- up.
