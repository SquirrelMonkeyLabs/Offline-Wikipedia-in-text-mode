 "text": "Shall We Tell the President? is a 1977 novel by English author Jeffrey Archer. A revised edition was published in 1986. In the first edition, a plot to kill the President of the United States, Edward Kennedy, is stopped by Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Mark Andrews working with the head of the FBI. The U.S. edition of the novel was published by Viking Press, where Kennedy's sister-in-law Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was then a consulting editor. Although Kennedy Onassis was not involved in editing Shall We Tell the President?, she was criticized for not trying to stop her employer from publishing a novel about an assassination plot against a member of the Kennedy family. She resigned from Viking Press shortly after the publication. ==References== Category:1977 books",
