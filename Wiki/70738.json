 "text": "The Dardanelles is the narrow strait in northwestern Turkey that connects the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara. It marks the division between Asia, to the east, and Europe, to the west. The waterway is highly significant to all countries in the region because it provides access to the Black Sea. The Treaty of Lausanne requires Turkey to allow merchant vessels to pass and limits Turkey's right to close the Straits to warships. In Ancient Greek times, it was also known as the Hellespont. ==Related pages== * The Dardanelles Campaign, during World War I.
