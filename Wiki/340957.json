 "text": "A Cesarean section (often called a C-section) is a kind of surgery done during childbirth or delivery. It is usually done to make childbirth easier and in some cases safer. In the past this was done when there was a great risk to the health of the mother, or when normal childbirth through the vagina was not possible. More recently it has also been done on request, without these reasons. In very rare cases, abortions are performed using this procedure, these are called Hysterotomy abortions. The first person to perform a modern Cesarean section was Ferdinand Adolf Kehrer in 1881. In Latin, it is called Sectio caesarea, in English, the spelling Caesarean section also exists. The rate of babies delivered through Cesarean section has been increasing globally. Since 2018, the Dominican Republic has the highest rate of Cesarian deliveries at 58.1%. Since 2018, the global rate of Cesarian deliveries is at 21.1% with deliveries being less common in underdeveloped countries. The rate in the United States in 2023 was at 32.4%. The World Health Organization claims the ideal rate should be 10-15% and that Cesarian Sections should only be performed when necessary.WHO Statement on Caesarean Section Rates. iris.who.int.
