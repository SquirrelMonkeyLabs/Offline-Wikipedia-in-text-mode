Serravalle and Dogana at sanmarinosite.com == Geography == The town is found at the northernmost point of San Marino after Falciano, close to the border with Italy, in the province of Rimini. == History == It has a population of roughly 7,000. Because of its size, in 2006 it asked to split away from Serravalle and become its own castello, but in 2007 the proposal was refused. Partial autonomy is seen in Dogana's having its own postal code (47891), while the rest of Serravalle carries 47899. == Economy == Dogana is the main entry point for travellers arriving into San Marino from Italy (by freeway no. 72 from Rimini). Although Dogana means customs house in Italian, there are no border formalities anywhere on the border between Italy and San Marino. == Sport == The local football team is the Juvenes. == Gallery == File:Italia-SanMarino.JPG|Borders between Italy and San Marino at Dogana File:San Marino in World War II.jpg|Neutrality placards at the borders of San Marino during World War II (\"Republic of San Marino - Neutral State\") == References == == Other websites == * Category:Towns in Europe Category:San Marino",
