 "text": "SiIvaGunner (spelt Siivagunner, pronounced See-va-gunner), formerly GiIvaSunner, is a musical group best known for their YouTube channel that uploads videos which claim to be \"high-quality rips\" of video game music, but in reality are remixes or mashups of the songs most often involving references to Internet memes, popular music, and their own running-gags such as 7 GRAND DAD (a Taiwanese bootleg of a Flintstones video game containing stolen assets of Mario that replace the main characters), The Nutshack, and Snow Halation, a song from the anime Love Live. == History == The channel originally went by the name GiIvaSunner; this is a reference to the now-defunct channel GilvaSunner, but with a capital \"i\" used in place of a lowercase \"L\" (with the effect of making the channel names appear identical). Following the termination of their original YouTube channel in April 2016, the name was changed to SiIvaGunner for the new channel (retaining the capital \"i\"). In late 2019, the art gallery Gallery Aferro featured an exhibit titled \"Elevator Music 6: SiIvaGunner\", curated by Juno Zago. An auditory exhibit, it was a collection of SiIvaGunner remixes of classic and new video game music played inside an early-1900s refurbished Otis elevator. The channel has also lead to the popularity of some specific Internet memes such as \"Yoshi Commits Tax Fraud\", a made-up joke video game. == References == Category:YouTubers",
