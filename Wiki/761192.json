 "text": "Antifeminism is opposition to some or all forms of feminism. It has changed over the years and in different cultures. In the late 19th century and early 20th century antifeminists were opposed to women's suffrage, that is allowing women to vote in elections. In the United States in they also opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, which would give change the Constitution to give both men and women equal rights. In the 21st century, antifeminists believe that feminism is not about rights for women, but is about taking away the rights of men. ==References== Category:Antifeminism",
