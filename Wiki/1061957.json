 "text": "In Linear Algebra, a Vandermonde matrix, named after Alexandre-Th√©ophile Vandermonde, is a (m + 1) \\times (n + 1) matrix with the form: :V = V(x_0, x_1, \\cdots, x_m) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_0 & x_0^2 & \\dots & x_0^n\\\\\\ 1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \\dots & x_1^n\\\\\\ 1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \\dots & x_2^n\\\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots &\\vdots \\\\\\ 1 & x_m & x_m^2 & \\dots & x_m^n \\end{bmatrix} with entries V_{i,j} = x_i^j , the jth power of the number x_i, for all indices i and j where i and j start at 0. Most authors define the Vandermonde matrix as the transpose of the above matrix. == Applications == Vandermonde matrices are commonly used in introductory Linear Algebra courses to prove least squares solutions.
