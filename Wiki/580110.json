Bentley's resignation on April 10, 2017 in the aftermath of a sex scandal. She beat Walter Maddox in the 2018 Alabama gubernatorial election to complete her full term. Ivey is the first woman to be Alabama's governor since Lurleen Wallace, who succeeded her husband George Wallace in 1967. Ivey was born an only child to Boadman Nettles Ivey and Barbara Ivey. The family had been in Alabama for many generations, as her ancestor Ann Johnson Nettles Riley was one of several slave owning Nettles in the state. In September 2019, Ivey was diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer. She was cancer-free in January 2020. ==References== ==Other websites== *Alabama Lt.Gov. official government site *Alabama State Treasury official government site *Kay Ivey for Lt.
