 "text": "\"Don't Tell Me No\" is a song by the American new wave band The Cars. The song, written by Ric Ocasek, appeared on the band's third studio album, Panorama. ==Release and reception== \"Don't Tell Me No\" was first released on the Panorama album in August 1980, but in November of that same year, the song was released as the follow-up single to \"Touch and Go\" which had a marginal success in America. Unlike its predecessor, however, it did not chart at all. The single was not released in any other countries besides the United States. AllMusic reviewer Greg Prato noted the track as a highlight from the Panorama album and went on to call it \"strong, just not as well known as some of the other material[.]\" ==B-side== The B-side of the song \"Don't Go To Pieces\" features Benjamin Orr on lead vocals. \"Don't Go To Pieces\" later saw release as the B-side to \"Gimme Some Slack,\" the follow-up single to \"Don't Tell Me No.\" ==References== Category:The Cars songs Category:1980 songs",
