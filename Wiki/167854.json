 "text": "WWE Night of Champions is a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming shows made by WWE. The first Night of Champions event held in 2007 was named Vengeance: Night of Champions and was also a part of the Vengeance series. All nine WWE championships were defended that night. In 2008, the event was renamed to Night of Champions, keeping the format of the 2007 event, but dropping the Vengeance name. In 2009, the event was moved back to July. From 2010 to 2015, it was held in September. In 2016, it was replaced by Clash of Champions, before returning in May 2023 as WWE's ninth event in Saudi Arabia. ==Dates and venues== Event Date City Venue Main Event Vengeance: Night of Champions June 24, 2007 Houston, Texas Toyota Center John Cena (c) vs. Mick Foley vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Randy Orton vs. King Booker in Five Pack Challenge match for the WWE Championship Night of Champions (2008) June 29, 2008 Dallas, Texas American Airlines Center Triple H (c) vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship Night of Champions (2009) July 26, 2009 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Wachovia Center CM Punk (c) vs. Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship Night of Champions (2010) September 19, 2010 Rosemont, Illinois Allstate Arena Sheamus (c) vs. Wade Barrett vs. Chris Jericho vs. Edge vs. Randy Orton vs. John Cena in a Six-Pack Elimination Match for the WWE Championship Night of Champions (2011) September 18, 2011 Buffalo, New York First Niagara Center Triple H vs. CM Punk in a No Disqualification match Night of Champions (2012) September 16, 2012 Boston, Massachusetts TD Garden CM Punk (c) vs. John Cena for the WWE Championship Night of Champions (2013) September 15, 2013 Detroit, Michigan Joe Louis Arena Randy Orton (c) vs. Daniel Bryan for the WWE Championship Night of Champions (2014) September 21, 2014 Nashville, Tennessee Bridgestone Arena Brock Lesnar (c) vs. John Cena for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship Night of Champions (2015) September 20, 2015 Houston, Texas Toyota Center Seth Rollins (c) vs. Sting for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship Night of Champions (2023) May 27, 2023 Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Jeddah Super Dome Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn (c) vs The Bloodline (Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa) for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship (Raw and SmackDown Tag Team Championship) ==Related pages== * List of WWE pay- per-view events == Notes == == Other websites == * Night of Champions official website",
