 "text": "Krishna II of the Rashtrakuta Empire along with his ally Commander Malla I of Velanadu defeated Narayanapala of the Pala Empire during 908 A.D. Krishna II may have annexed Orissa as it was lost by Narayanapala after the Rashtrakuta Invasion while Ranasthambha, the king of sulki conquered Radha province of Pala Empire. ==Battle== Krishna II, the Rashtrakuta king, likely defeated Narayanapala in battle, as he is said to have been the teacher who made the Gauda people take an oath of humility. However peace was established between the two kingdoms with a marriage alliance, Narayanapala married his son Rajyapala to the daughter of Tunga, who some believe was Jagattunga, the son of Krishna II. Part of Radha may have been taken over by the Sulki king, Maharajadhiraja Ranasthambha. Malla I of Velanadu also claimed to have conquered the Vangas, Magadhas, and Gaudas, and he might have fought alongside Krishna II as a military leader. == References == Category:India Category:Battles involving the Pala Empire",
