 "text": "The WAGR Dd class were a total of 10 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1946 to 1972. The Dd class were built from scratch at Midland Railway Workshops for suburban service in Perth. However, they did work as far as Bunbury on the South Western mainline and Merredin on the Eastern Railway. The first was withdrawn in 1969 with the rest following in 1971 to 1972 with the end of steam on the WAGR. Two of the Dd have been preserved, No. 592 is on display at the ARHS Rail Heritage W.A. Bassendean Railway Museum and No. 596 is also owned by the ARHS but is displayed at Gosnells Railway Markets. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
