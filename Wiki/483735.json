 "text": "Aeroflot is the national airline of the Russian Federation. It's one of the oldest airlines in the world. It has been flying for over a century. ==History== Aeroflot began in 1923 in the Soviet Union. Much of Aeroflot's history was kept secret once the Cold War began and Aeroflot had to stop flying to the United States. Throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s, Aeroflot and many Eastern Bloc airlines suffered many air crashes due to old and poor Russian airplanes. Those were the only ones Aeroflot and those airlines could use. However, Aeroflot was the world's largest airline until the 1980s. After the Soviet Union ended in 1991, Aeroflot began modernizing its fleet and buying more Western airplanes, like the Airbus A300 and Boeing 767. By 1991, Aeroflot again started flying to the United States. Aeroflot is member of aviation alliance SkyTeam. As of 2021, Aeroflot was flying to 146 cities in 52 countries. == Fleet == Aircraft In service Order Notes A320-200 64 A321-200 36 A330-200 2 A330-300 10 A350-900 7 13 B737-800 37 B777-300ER 22 Ikrut MS-21 260 Additional order for 210 of its type in September 2022 Sukhoi Superjet 100 4 ==References== Category:1923 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:Companies of Russia Category:Airlines of Russia Category:IATA members",
