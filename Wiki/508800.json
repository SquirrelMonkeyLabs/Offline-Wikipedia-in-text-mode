The town was named after the bridge built over the LaHave River. The first house in Bridgewater was built in 1812 by Ralph Hotchkiss. The town was incorporated in 1899. This was shortly after a fire in Bridgewater which burned the entire downtown area. For much of the 20th century, the town's economy depended on forestry. There was a large wood mill in the center of town. The Nova Scotia Central Railway and later the Halifax and Southwestern Railway had a central hub at Bridgewater. The \"Acadia Marine Engine Company\" was based in Bridgewater.
