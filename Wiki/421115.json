They have released nine full-length albums and two live albums. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and deliberately explicit behavior. This behavior has resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving Warped Tour in 2004 due to conflicting political views and attitudes towards other musicians. == References == Category:American punk bands Category:1988 establishments in California Category:Musical groups from Huntington Beach, California Category:Musical groups established in 1988",
