 "text": "Amulius was a mythological king of Alba Longa, known for his role in the story of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. He was the younger son of Procas, the king of Alba Longa, and is infamous for his usurpation of the throne from his elder brother, Numitor, and for his attempt to prevent the birth of future claimants to the throne. == Background and usurpation of the throne == Amulius was born into the royal family of Alba Longa, part of the line descended from Aeneas, the Trojan hero. Upon the death of Procas, the kingship was meant to pass to the elder son, Numitor, but Amulius seized the throne by force. He exiled Numitor and took control of the kingdom. To prevent Numitor’s line from challenging his rule, he took drastic measures to eliminate any heirs. == Rhea Silvia and the birth of Romulus and Remus == Amulius feared that any descendants of Numitor might one day attempt to reclaim the throne. To ensure this, he forced Numitor’s daughter, Rhea Silvia, to become a Vestal Virgin, which legally required her to remain celibate and childless. However, according to myth, Rhea Silvia was visited by the god Mars and bore twin sons, Romulus and Remus. When Amulius learned of the birth of Romulus and Remus, he ordered the infants to be thrown into the Tiber River, hoping to eliminate any threat to his rule. However, the twins survived and were eventually raised by a she-wolf (lupa) and later by a shepherd named Faustulus. == Downfall and death == As young men, Romulus and Remus learned of their true heritage and gathered a band of supporters. They attacked Alba Longa, overthrew Amulius, and restored their grandfather Numitor to the throne. In most versions of the myth, Amulius was killed during the uprising, bringing his rule to a violent end. == Legacy and role in Roman mythology == Amulius’s story is central to the myth of Rome’s founding, embodying themes of tyranny and justice. He serves as a contrast to Numitor's just and rightful rule and plays a pivotal role in setting the stage for Romulus and Remus’s ascension. Amulius’s fear-driven actions and his attempt to thwart destiny ultimately led to his downfall and the establishment of Rome, fulfilling the divine prophecy connected to Romulus and Remus. == Related pages == * Romulus and Remus * Rhea Silvia * Roman mythology == References == * Livy, Ab Urbe Condita (The History of Rome) * Virgil, Aeneid * Plutarch, Parallel Lives - \"The Life of Romulus\" Category:Roman mythology Category:Fictional people",
