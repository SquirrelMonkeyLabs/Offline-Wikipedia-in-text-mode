 "text": "Vorkuta (; Komi: Вӧркута, Vörkuta; Nenets for \"the abundance of bears\", \"bear corner\") is a coal-mining town in northern Komi Republic, Russia. It is located right above the Arctic Circle and built near the river Vorkuta. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the town lost population as the mines were abandoned. == History == In 1930, geologist Georgy Chernov found large amounts of coal fields next to the river Vorkuta. These coal fields were soon developed. This was the start of coal-mining in the Komi ASSR. The origins of the town of Vorkuta (have much to do with, or) are associated with Vorkutlag. That was one of the most notorious forced-labour camps of the Gulag network. Airbase: During the Cold War, the Vorkuta Sovetsky airbase was used as a base for strategic bombers by the Soviets. == Economy == By the early 21st century, most of the mines in Vorkuta were closed because of the high costs of keeping them open. === Transportation === The small Vorkuta Airport is located in the town. == Climate == Vorkuta has a subarctic climate (Köppen classification system Dfc) with short cool summers and cold and snowy winters. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in the Komi Republic",
