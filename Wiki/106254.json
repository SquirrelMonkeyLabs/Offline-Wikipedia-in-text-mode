Denver itself is within the Rocky Mountains, a mile above sea level. The team began play in 1993. In 1995, they moved into their current ballpark, Coors Field. They made the playoffs five times, each time as a wild card. In 2007, the Rockies played in the World Series for the first (and so far, only) time. They were swept by the Boston Red Sox. ==Other websites== *Official Website",
