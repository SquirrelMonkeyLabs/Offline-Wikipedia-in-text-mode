The mall is near Interstate 284, O'Hare International Airport and Rosemont Theatre, making it a popular tourist destination. It opened on August 1, 2013, and has more than 140 stores. Owned by Macerich, it was developed with AWE Talisman. == History == Construction of the mall begun in November 2011, after an announcement that a new $250 million mall called the Fashion Outlets of Chicago would open in Rosemont, Illinois, near Interstate 284 and O'Hare International Airport. It was planned to have 140 stores and open in 2012. The mall opened on August 1, 2013. In 2015, the mall's owner, Macerich, announced that it would make plans to expand the mall. The expansion required the demolition of the struggling Rosemont Theatre, which was competing with Chicago venues. The Rosemont village gave approval to the 250,000 square feet expansion in 2018, but could not release more details about it. That same year, 57.8 million people visited the mall. The mall called off the project in 2020. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Illinois Category:Malls Category:2013 establishments in the United States Category:2010s establishments in Illinois",
