 "text": "The Magi or the Three Wise Men are people in Christianity. They were \"wise men from the east\" who came to Jerusalem during the reign of Herod: 'saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews?' ( Gospel of Matthew chapter 2 verse 1) Their visit to Jesus, guided by the Star of Bethlehem is celebrated every year at Epiphany on January 6, just after Christmas. The Epiphany marks the end of the liturgical season 'Christmas'. India is east of Israel, and some say that the Magi could have come from India. At the time of Jesus there were many spiritual seekers there. In India, Christian celebrations of Christmas sometimes include the arrival of the Magi on camels. An Armenian tradition says the \"Magi of Bethlehem\" were Balthasar of Arabia, Melchior of Persia, and Caspar of India. == References == ==Other websites== *Magi at Catholic encyclopedia Category:New Testament people",
