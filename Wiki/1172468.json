Before the inauguration of the libertarian, the areas of labour, education, culture and social welfare each had their own ministry within the Government of Argentina. The Ministry of Human Capital can therefore be considered as the merging of the ministries of Labour, Employment and Social Security, Education, Culture and Social Development. On 10 December 2023, on his very first day as President of Argentina, Milei modified the law through a Necessity and Urgency Decree and reduced the previous 19 government ministries to nine. While planned to be removed and included in this portfolio, the Ministry of Health was ultimately kept by the president and attributed to cardiologist Mario Russo. ==References== Category:Government ministries of Argentina",
