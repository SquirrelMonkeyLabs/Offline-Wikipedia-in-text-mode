 "text": "Tools are things used to make tasks easier. Tools have changed over time. The first tools were made in the Stone Age and Bronze Age. Throughout history, people have made many new and more complicated tools. Some examples of tools that are often used today are the hammer, the wrench (also called a spanner), saws, shovel, telephone, and the computer. Very basic things like knives, pens, and pencils are also tools. The bludgeon (a stick or rock used as a weapon to smash things) was one of the first tools made by humans. The knife is also one of the first tools humans made. A hand tool is powered by the muscles of the person using it. Most hand tools are hand-held (small enough to be carried and used in the hands). Hammers, wrenches, and knives are examples of hand tools. A power tool is powered by another source of energy like electricity. A power tool is otherwise similar to a hand tool. Most power tools are also hand-held or portable (small enough to be easily moved). Hand- held electric drills and chainsaws are examples of power tools.
