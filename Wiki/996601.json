Dickey was born in Buckhead, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. He read Lord Byron's poetry when he was young. In high school, he was good at football. He played varsity at Clemson College in South Carolina. World War II caused him to leave Clemson in 1942. He joined the U. S. Air Force and fought in the Asian and Pacific area. He started writing poetry during this time. After the war, he finished his college work by getting a masters degree at Vanderbilt University. He taught for a while, but got a job writing advertisements to make more money. In 1966, his poetry book Buckdancer's Choice won the National Book Award. Three of his other books were finalists: Helmets (1965), Deliverance (1971), and Sorties (1972). Deliverance was a novel that later was made into a movie.
