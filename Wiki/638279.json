The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association cannot be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams are seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting this season): * Pot 1 contains the Champions League and Europa League title holders, and the champions of the top six associations based on their 2017 UEFA country coefficients. If either or both title holders are one of the champions of the top six associations, the champions of the next highest ranked association(s) are also seeded into Pot 1. * Pot 2, 3 and 4 contain the remaining teams, seeded based on their 2018 UEFA club coefficients. In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams enter the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League round of 32. The matchdays are 18–19 September, 2–3 October, 23–24 October, 6–7 November, 27–28 November, and 11–12 December 2018. A total of 32 teams play in the group stage: 26 teams which enter in this stage, and the six winners of the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path). * Atlético Madrid CC: 140.000 (Pot 1) * Bayern Munich CC: 135.000 (Pot 1) * Barcelona CC: 132.000 (Pot 1) * Juventus CC: 126.000 (Pot 1) * Paris Saint- Germain CC: 109.000 (Pot 1) * Manchester City CC: 100.000 (Pot 1) * Lokomotiv Moscow CC: 22.500 (Pot 1) * Real Madrid CC: TBD (160.000) (Pot 1 if Champions League title holders otherwise Pot 2) * Borussia Dortmund CC: 89.000 (Pot 2) * Porto CC: 86.000 (Pot 2) * Manchester United CC: 82.000 (Pot 2) * Shakhtar Donetsk CC: 81.000 (Pot 2) * Napoli CC: 78.000 (Pot 2) * Tottenham Hotspur CC: 67.000 * Roma CC: 64.000 * Liverpool CC: TBD (62.000) (Pot 1 if Champions League title holders) * Schalke 04 CC: 62.000 (Pot 3) * Lyon CC: 59.500 (Pot 3) * Monaco CC: 57.000 (Pot 3) * CSKA Moscow CC: 45.000 (Pot 3) * Valencia CC: 36.000 * Viktoria Plzeň CC: 33.000 * Club Brugge CC: 29.500 * Galatasaray CC: 29.500 * Internazionale CC: 16.000 (Pot 4) * 1899 Hoffenheim CC: 14.285 (Pot 4) ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Group E=== ===Group F=== ===Group G=== ===Group H=== ==Knockout stage== In the knockout stage, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: * In the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners are seeded, and the eight group runners-up are unseeded. The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other. * In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. ===Round of 16=== The draw for the round of 16 will be held on 17 December 2018. The first legs will be played on 12, 13, 19 and 20 February, and the second legs will be played on 5, 6, 12 and 13 March 2019. ===Quarter-finals=== The draw for the quarter-finals will be held on 15 March 2019. The first legs will be played on 9 and 10 April, and the second legs will be played on 16 and 17 April 2019. ===Semi-finals=== The draw for the semi-finals will be held on 19 April 2019. The first legs will be played on 30 April and 1 May, and the second legs will be played on 7 and 8 May 2019. ===Final=== The final will be played on 1 June 2019 at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid. The \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) will be determined by an additional draw held after the semi-final draw. ==References== ==Other websites== * UEFA Champions League (official website) Category:August 2018 events Category:July 2018 events Category:June 2018 events",
