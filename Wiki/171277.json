One picosecond contains 1000 femtoseconds. There are 1000 picoseconds in one nanosecond. ;Notation * 10-10 seconds is 100 picoseconds. * 10-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond. ;Examples * One picosecond is the half-life of a bottom quark. * Ten picoseconds after the Big Bang, electromagnetism became its own force. * It takes light about 3.3 picoseconds to travel one millimeter. * It takes a common 3.0-gigahertz computer 3.3 × 100 picoseconds to add two integers together.
