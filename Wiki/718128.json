 "text": "Aport is a variety of apple that is grown in Russia and some other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. It is over 150 years old. After being brought to the Alatau Mountain area of Kazakhstan in the latter half of the nineteenth century, it was modified to its current state due to the different soil and altitude. It is a cross between M. sieversii and a Russian variety. The apples usually weigh between 200 and 500 grams. The Alexander variety of aport can weigh up to 900 grams. The skin is a light green and red color. The meat has a crisp, medium density. The apples are sweet. The aport is a fall-ripening fruit. ==In popular culture== The aport apple is a symbol of the city of Almaty. == Sources == *https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/almaty-aport- apple/ *http://eurasia.travel/kazakhstan/cities_towns_places/southeast_kazakhstan/almaty/almaty_apples/ *https://www.cooksinfo.com/aport-apples *https://business.gov.kz/ru/resources/success-stories/detail.php?ID=97656 ==References== Category:Apples",
