 "text": "In linear algebra and functional analysis, a projection is a linear transformation P from a vector space to itself such that P2 = P. Projections map the whole vector space to a subspace and leave the points in that subspace unchanged.Meyer, pp 386+387 ==Notes== ==References== * N. Dunford and J.T.
