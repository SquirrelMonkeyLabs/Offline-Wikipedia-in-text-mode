 "text": "A Different World was an American sitcom. The series was of the Hillman College, a fictional African American college in Virginia. The show aired on NBC. The show was aired from September 24, 1987 to July 9, 1993. There were many actors on the show, like Lisa Bonet, Jasmine Guy, Marisa Tomei, Loretta Devine, Keshia Knight Pulliam and Jada Pinkett. The show looked at strong topics, like epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, the Equal Rights Amendment, race and class relations. In season 2, it came to the attention of Bill Cosby and the producers that the show wasn't truly looking at a historically black college. That's when Debbie Allen was hired as the chief creative force to revamp the series. ==References== Category:1990s American comedy television series Category:1980s American black sitcoms Category:1987 American television series debuts Category:1993 American television series endings Category:English- language television programs",
