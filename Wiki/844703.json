 "text": "Statin drugs, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are lipid-lowering drugs that reduce illness in people who have a high risk of cardiovascular disease. They are the most common cholesterol-lowering drugs. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carriers of cholesterol play key roles in arteriosclerosis, stroke and coronary heart disease. The common side effects of statins are diabetes mellitus, nausea, hormonal imbalance, and muscle pains. Statin drug names end in the word 'statin' to help know what the drugs do. Atorvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed brands, was in short supply in England in 2023 and the price rose from 49p through to Â£5.30 per pack. == Related pages == * LDL and lDL (little L); Cholesterol * Heart * Estrogen ==References==",
