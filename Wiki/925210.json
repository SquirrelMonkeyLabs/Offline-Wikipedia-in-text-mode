When eruption of lava ended, the Ontong plateau covered 1% of Earth's surface. It had a volume of of basaltic magma. This Ontong Java event was the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years. Its magma production was several times larger than the Deccan Traps. The smooth surface of the OJP is punctuated by seamounts such as the Ontong Java Atoll, one of the largest atolls in the world. == References == ===Sources=== * * * * * * ** * Category:Plateaus Category:Flood basalts Category:Pacific Ocean Category:Geography of the Solomon Islands",
