 "text": "Lillers is a commune. It is found in the region Hauts-de-France in the Pas-de- Calais department in the north of France. ==History== In the year 700 AD, two Irish princes, Lugli and Luglien, were on a pilgrimage to Rome. On the road between Boulogne and Thérouanne, near Ferfay, they were attacked and killed by robbers. Their servants buried the bodies, but they were moved by a storm to the castle of the Bishop of Thérouanne. This was seen to be a miracle. When the Normans invaded, the bodies, now holy relics, were moved to a safer place on an island with a marsh all around it. Years later, the sister of the princes, Lilia, came to pray at the chapel built to hold the relics. The town was named Lillers, after her. ==World War 1== In World War I, Lillers was the site of a big British military hospital. Nearly 900 soldiers are buried in the cemetery. They include two winners of the Victoria Cross, Corporal William Richard Cotter and Major David Nelson. ==Related pages== * Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department ==References== ==Other websites== * Official commune website * Lillers on the Quid website Category:Communes in Pas-de-Calais",
