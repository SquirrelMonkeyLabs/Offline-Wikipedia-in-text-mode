 "text": "The Philippine-American War was an armed military conflict between the United States and the First Philippine Republic. It was fought from 1899 to at least 1902. The conflict arose from a Filipino political struggle against U.S. occupation of the Philippines. While the conflict was officially declared over on July 4, 1902, American troops continued hostilities against remnants of the Philippine Army and other resistance groups until 1913. Some historians consider these unofficial extensions part of the war. The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously). Eighty-six men received the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Philippine–American War. 70 from the Army. 10 from the Navy. 6 from the Marine Corps. Four of the medals were posthumous. Among the recipients were Webb Hayes who was the son of former U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes. Two well known Marine Corps officers, Hiram I. Bearss and David Dixon Porter. Bearss became known for leading long-range reconnaissance patrols behind enemy lines. He was later wounded as a colonel in World War I. Porter was from a distinguished military family and rose to become a major general. José B. Nísperos was a member of the Philippine Scouts. He was honored for continuing to fight after being wounded and was the first Asian recipient of the Medal of Honor. ==Recipients== :Note: Notes in quotations are derived or are copied in their entirety from the actual Medal of Honor citation Image Name Service Rank Place of action Date of action Unit Notes Army San Miguel de Mayumo, Luzon Company B, 1st North Dakota Volunteer Infantry With 11 other scouts, completely routed about 300 of the enemy Army Calamba, Luzon 4th U.S. Cavalry ”Swam the San Juan River in the face of the enemy's fire and [forced them to retreat]” Marine Corps junction of the Cadacan and Sohoton Rivers, Samar Marine Corps Subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in World War I Army Near Porac, Luzon 36th Infantry, U.S. Volunteers ”Led a successful charge against a superior force, capturing and dispersing the enemy and relieving other members of his regiment from a perilous position” Army Near Porac, Luzon 36th Infantry, U.S. Volunteers Later became Chief of Staff of the United States Army Army Bayong, near Lake Lanao, Mindanao 27th U.S. Infantry ”Crossed a fire-swept field, in close range of the enemy, and brought a wounded soldier to a place of shelter” Army Near Loac, Luzon 28th Infantry, U.S. Volunteers ”With but 19 men resisted and at close quarters defeated 300 of the enemy” Army San Miguel de Mayumo, Luzon 3d U.S. Artillery ”With 12 men charged and routed 300 of the enemy” Army Near San Isidro Company I, 1st North Dakota Volunteer Infantry ”With 21 other scouts completely routed 600 of the enemy” Marine Corps Luzon Marine Corps ”For distinguished conduct in the presence of the enemy in battle” Army Bobong, Negros 6th U.S. Infantry Rallied his men on the bridge after the line had been broken and pushed back Army Catubig, Samar – Company H, 43d Infantry, U.S. Volunteers ”Assumed command of a detachment and withstood the attacks of a large enemy force for 2 days, saving the lives of the survivors and protecting the wounded until relief came” Navy Mundang, Basilan, Philippine Islands For actions during the Moro Rebellion Army Near Sariaya, Luzon Company F, 30th Infantry, U.S. Volunteers ”Single-handed, he defended a disabled comrade against a greatly superior force of the enemy” Army Bud-Dajo, Jolo 19th U.S. Infantry Risked his life to carry a wounded man and the body of one who was killed beside him Army Near Calulut, Luzon Battery G, 3d U.S. Artillery ”While in command of a detachment of 4 men, charged and routed 40 entrenched insurgents, inflicting on them heavy loss.
