He was best known songs like \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\", \"Party Up (Up in Here)\", \"Where the Hood At?\" and \"X Gon' Give It to Ya\". He was also the founder and owner of Bloodline Records. He was one of the best-selling hip hop artists ever. He released seven albums: Unleashed and Unreleased, It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, Flesh of my Flesh, Blood of my Blood, And Then There Was X, The Grand Champ, The Great Depression, Year of the Dog...Again and his recent one Undisputed. As an actor, DMX starred in movies such as Belly, Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, Cradle 2 the Grave, and Last Hour. In 2006, he starred in the BET reality television series DMX: Soul of a Man. ==Health problems and death== On February 10, 2016, he was found unresponsive at a parking lot at a Ramada Inn in Yonkers, New York. He was resuscitated by first responders and intravenously given Narcan, an opioid-reversal drug; he responded quickly to Narcan and became semi-conscious. Simmons was subsequently rushed to the hospital. A witness said he ingested a powdered substance before collapsing, but police found no illegal substances on the property. Simmons stated that it was from an asthma attack. He died April 9, 2021 at the age of 50. A week earlier he was rushed to a hospital in White Plains, New York where he was reported to be in critical condition following a heart attack at his home possibly resulting from a drug overdose. The next day, his attorney Murray Richman confirmed Simmons was on life support. That same night, Simmons suffered cerebral hypoxia as paramedics attempted to resuscitate him for 30 minutes. Simmons's former manager, Nakia Walker, said he was in a \"vegetative state\" with \"lung and brain failure and no current brain activity\". His manager, SRC and Loud Records founder Steve Rifkind, stated Simmons was comatose and that he was set to undergo tests to determine his brain's functionality and his family will \"determine what's best from there\". It was revealed on July 8 by the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office that Simmons' official cause of death was a cocaine-induced heart attack. ==References== ;Notes ==Other websites== * Category:1970 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Actors from New York (state) Category:African-American actors Category:African-American rappers Category:Rappers from New York (state) Category:People from Yonkers, New York Category:People from Mount Vernon, New York Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Drug-related deaths in the United States Category:Gangsta rappers Category:Hardcore hip hop artists Category:Horrorcore artists",
