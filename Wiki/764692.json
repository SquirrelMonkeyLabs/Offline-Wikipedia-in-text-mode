 "text": "The West Semitic languages are a large branch of Semitic languages. It is the only branch of Semitic languages with languages still spoken. The other branch of Semitic languages was East Semitic. It is extinct. The two branches of West Semitic languages are Central and Southern. Some linguists disagree with the branches. They think that Central and Southern Semitic languages are not related and are actually separate branches of Semitic languages.The Semitic Languages: An International Handbook, Chapter V, page 425Fritz Hommel, Die semitischen Volker und Sprachen als erster Versuch einer Encyclopadie der semitischen Sprach- und Alterthums-Wissenschaft, (1883) ==References== Category:Semitic languages",
