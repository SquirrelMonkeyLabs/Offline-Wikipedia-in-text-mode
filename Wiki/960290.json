 "text": "The Dispatch is an American conservative news and opinion website created by Steve Hayes and Jonah Goldberg and with Goldberg as its editor in chief. ==Post-Trump Conservatism== Steve Hayes worked for Fox News when George W. Bush was President of the United States and was editor of The Weekly Standard when Barack Obama was president and was a member of the Republican Party of the United States but in 2016 he was a supporter of the Never Trump Movement. After leaving the Weekly Standard, Hayes reached out to Jonah Goldberg who worked for National Review at the time and was a part of the Never Trump Movement and told him that either in 2021 or in 2025 Donald Trump would no longer be President and as such American conservatism needed to mean something different from support for Trump for it to mean anything. Goldberg agreed with Hayes so they created a new website called The Dispatch and said it was for “Post-Trump Conservatism”. ==Contributors== The Dispatch publishes work by Jonah Goldberg, Steve Hayes, David French, Sarah Isgur, Rachel Larrimore, Timothy Sandefur, Klon Kitchen, Brad Polumbo, Kevin Williamson and Allahpundit.
