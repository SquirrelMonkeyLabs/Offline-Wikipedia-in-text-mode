The gods turned his brother Váli into a slavering wolf who tore his throat out. His entrails were used to bind Loki to a stone slab for all eternity, or at least until Ragnarok. The name was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21, 2005. == Other websites == * IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature * IAUC 8116: Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn 2003 April 11 (discovery) * MPEC 2003-G39: S/2003 S 1 2003 April 8 (discovery and ephemeris) * IAUC 8471: Satellites of Saturn 2005 January 21 (naming the moon) Category:Saturn's moons",
