 "text": "Pheasants are a group of large birds in the order Galliformes. Males pheasants are usually larger and flashier than the females. They have feathers of bright colours and long tails. There are 35 species of pheasant in 11 different genera. Native pheasants are restricted to Eurasia. In many countries pheasant species are hunted, often illegally, as game. Several species are threatened by this and other human activities. Chukar is the official National bird of Pakistan. == Implications == The fact is that \"pheasant\" is not the name of a particular bird. It is the common name for a type of bird which has independently evolved in many different places. ==References== *Beebe, William. 1918-22. A Monograph of the Pheasants. 1st edition in 4 volumes: H.
