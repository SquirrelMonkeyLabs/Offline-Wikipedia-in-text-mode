 "text": "The House of the Virgin Mary (Turkish: Meryem Ana Evi) is a Catholic and Muslim shrine on Mount Ala dağı also Bülbül dağı near Ephesus, from Selçuk in Turkey. The house was discovered in the 19th century when the directions were followed in the alleged visions of the blessed Anna Katharina Emmerich (1774–1824), a Roman Catholic nun. These visions were published as a book after her death by Clemens Brentano. The Catholic Church never let him out in favor or against the authenticity of the house, but pilgrims have visited the place regularly since its discovery. Pope John Paul II beatified Emmerich on October 3, 2004. Catholic pilgrims visit the house in the belief that Mary, mother of Jesus, was taken there by John and that she lived there until her ascension. Already in 1896, Pope Leo XIII visited the house, and the most recent visit by a Pope was in 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI. == References ==",
