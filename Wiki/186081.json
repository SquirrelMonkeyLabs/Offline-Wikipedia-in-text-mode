 "text": "Shadwell DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway is between the termini of Bank and Tower Gateway to the west and Limehouse to the east. It stands on a viaduct shared with National Rail trains (on the c2c line to Essex), with a single island platform accessed by stairs and a passenger lift (via the entrance on Watney Street). It opened on 31 August 1987 as part of the first tranche of DLR stations. The 1991 Bank extension joins the main DLR line just west of Shadwell. ==References== == Other websites == * * Docklands Light Railway website - Shadwell station page Category:London Travelcard zone 2 Category:Docklands Light Railway stations Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets",
