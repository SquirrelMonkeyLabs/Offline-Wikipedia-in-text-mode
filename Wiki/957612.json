 "text": "New York State Route 174 (NY 174) is a state highway. It is in Onondaga County, in Central New York, in the United States. The highway is long. It passes through mostly rural regions. Route 174 begins at an intersection with NY 41 in Borodino, a small-town of Spafford. It heads generally northward for most of its length, except for short distances in the villages of Marcellus and Camillus. The road was first constructed in the early 19th century. It followed the path of Nine Mile Creek. It connected several early settlements in Central New York. Later, the northern half of the route was improved as a plank road in 1855. This was done by a private corporation that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over the maintenance of the road by the beginning of the 20th century. Several minor realignments have been made in the areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses. == References == == Other websites == Category:Roads in New York (state)",
