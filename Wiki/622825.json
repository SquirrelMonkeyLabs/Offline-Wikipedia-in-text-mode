 "text": "Popular Problems is the thirteenth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. It was released on September 19, 2014 in Friday-release countries (such as France and Ireland) and on September 22, 2014 elsewhere. Most of the songs were new, though Cohen did debut \"Born in Chains\" onstage in 2010 and \"My Oh My\" was played during a soundcheck the same year. Upon its release the album received uniformly positive reviews from critics. The New York Times gave a moderately positive review, calling Cohen \"one of rockâ€™s most profound aphorists\". The album peaked at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 20,000 copies in its first week. ==References== Category:Leonard Cohen albums Category:2014 albums",
