 "text": "The Koli Shiledar were Koli military leaders who served in the Maratha armies, often holding positions of command among the cavalry. In the Maratha military system, a “Shiledar” was a soldier who provided his own arms typically his own sword, shield, and horse and was responsible for leading a small unit. When members of the Koli caste of Bavan Mavals earned this rank, they came to be known as Koli Shiledars. Koli shiledars played an important role in the Maratha military structure. Their responsibilities included leading troops into battle, employing guerrilla tactics, and using their local knowledge of terrain especially in the rugged Western Ghats and coastal regions to harass enemy forces. Their skill in rapid, hit-and-run operations was well suited to the Maratha style of warfare. Some Koli leaders, such as Khemirao Sarnaik, are remembered for uniting Koli groups and joining forces with or even encouraging Shivaji’s campaigns against Mughal authority. Others, like Javji Bamble, not only led successful rebellions against rival factions within the Maratha polity but later rose to the rank of Mansabdar (a high-ranking military officer) and Deshmukh (landlord/chief) after reconciling with the Maratha leadership. Their actions such as capturing forts, resisting enemy incursions, and disrupting Mughal supply lines contributed significantly to the military successes of the Maratha empire. Over time, Koli shiledars and other Koli soldiers were integrated into the broader Maratha fighting force. Their local roots and martial abilities helped the Marathas extend their influence in regions where indigenous knowledge and unconventional warfare were advantageous. Koli shiledars were Koli-origin military commanders who, by providing their own arms and leadership, became integral to the Maratha military machine. Their contributions ranged from leading cavalry units in direct combat to engaging in guerrilla warfare and strategic fort captures. Leaders like Khemirao Sarnaik and Javji Bamble exemplify how Koli shiledars not only fought bravely but also played key roles in shaping the military and political landscape of the Maratha empire. == References == Category:Koli titles Category:Koli",
