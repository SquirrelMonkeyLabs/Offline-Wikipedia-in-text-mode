 "text": "Coalbrookdale is a village in the Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire, England. It is in an area of great significance in the history of industrialisation. This is where iron ore was first smelted by Abraham Darby using easily mined \"coking coal\".Thomas E. 1999. Coalbrookdale and the Darby family: the story of the world's first industrial dynasty. York: Sessions/Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust. The coal was drawn from drift mines in the sides of the valley. As it contained far fewer impurities than normal coal, the iron it produced was of a superior quality. Along with many other industrial developments that were going on in other parts of the country, this discovery was a major factor in the growing industrialisation of Britain. It was the Industrial Revolution.Trinder B. 2000. The industrial revolution in Shropshire. 3rd ed, Chichester: Phillimore. Today, Coalbrookdale is home to the Ironbridge Institute, a partnership between the University of Birmingham and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust offering postgraduate and professional courses in heritage. == References == Category:Villages in Shropshire",
