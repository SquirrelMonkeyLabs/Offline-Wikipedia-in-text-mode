 "text": "Crassula ovata is a plant from Mozambique, and South Africa. It is commonly known as Jade plant, money tree or money plant. It is a succulent. Usually, it grows to be a small tree. It has green fleshy leaves. When it grows bigger, it spreads easily through branches breaking off. These branches will then develop roots, and a new plant will grow from them (that is a clone of the old one). It is also grown as a houseplant, worldwide. Usually, the plant has small white flowers, which appear in the cooler season (in South Africa: July and August). In other parts of the world, the plant may flower when the days are short, and the temperatures are betweeen 5 and 10 degrees Centigrade. Category:Saxifragales",
