Beside it, empty graves represent missing soldiers and officers who have fought in the Israeli Defense Forces. === National Memorial Hall === The National Memorial Hall For Israel's Fallen () at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem is an initiative of the Israeli Ministry of Defense to commemorate all military Israeli casualties of war and Jewish fighters from 1860 until today. The proposal to build the hall was announced by Defense Minister Ehud Barak in 2010. In 2012, the Israeli government approved the establishment of the National Memorial Hall at a cost of $40 million. Certification has been delayed because of a petition to the court by families of terror victims. They say that there is no mention in the hall of the names of those victims, although the Hall is planned to be built next to the main memorial to Israeli terror victims. The Memorial Hall opened on 30 April 2017. ==== Memorial of the Unknown Soldier ==== In the center of the hall is the eternal flame dedicated to the unknown soldiers of Israel. This means at least one unidentified set of remains is buried there so that the families of soldiers whose bodies were never brought back can go there, imagine it is their dead relative, and mourn. === Ancient burial cave === An ancient Jewish burial cave from the Second Temple period was found in the military cemetery in 1954. Architect Asher Hiram designed a new entrance for the cave, so it is included in the cemetery. === Gallery of Mount Herzl National Cemetery === Image:The Herzl Museum IMG 1153.JPG|Herzl museum Image:המרכז החינוכי - הר הרצל 3.jpg|Mount Herzl Educational Center Image:PikiWiki Israel 656 Hertzels Tomb קבר הרצל.JPG|Herzl's grave in the Mount Herzl Plaza Image:PikiWiki Israel 12112 menorah sculptuer at mount herzl.jpg|Menorah sculpture near main entrance Image:Rabins' Grave.JPG|Grave of Yitzhak Rabin in the Helkat Gdolei Ha'Uma Section Image:PikiWiki Israel 12118 monument to the victims on immigrants ship salvado.jpg|Mass grave of Jews who drowned in the sea during the Ha'apala period Image:Herzl's Family Graves IMG 1173.JPG|Graves of the Herzl family and of former chairmen of the World Zionist Organization Image:PikiWiki Israel 12579 entrance to the military cemetery on mount herzl.jpg|Entrance to the National Military and Police Cemetery Image:Mount Herzl Military Cemetery IMG 1274.JPG|Memorial Plaza of the National Military and Police Cemetery Image:Mount Herzl - Independence War Plot IMG 1279.JPG|Mass grave of soldiers in 1948 war section Image:Memorial for the Yeshuv Paratroopers IMG 1214.JPG|Graves of the seven Jewish Parachutists of the Mandate of Palestine Image:PikiWiki Israel 12300 avshalom feinberg grave on mount herzl.jpg|Grave of Olei Hagardom Image:Ancient burial cave at Mount Herzl military cemetery-1.JPG|Second Temple period burial cave discovered in the 1948 war section Image:Jadvasjem12022013 004.jpg|the Connecting Path to Yad Vashem == Mount of Remembrance == The Mount of Remembrance is the western summit of Mount Herzl.
