 "text": "Viral video is a video that is shared by Internet users by voluntarily posting it on their pages, resources, or using the \"share with a friend\" function. This is usually done through websites, social media, and e-mail. ==Overview== Viral videos are often funny and follow a script similar to TV comedies, although they may simply contain a well-captured moment or a ridiculous situation. The spread of camera phones has made it possible for anyone to make a lot of videos. The availability of low-cost or free video editors, as well as publishing platforms, makes it possible to make a video shot on a mobile phone go viral and share it via email or websites, as well as between phones via Bluetooth or MMS. ==History== The ideas and human behavior that make a video go viral have been known to mankind since prehistoric times, and their sociological aspects are studied in the context of mimicry and semiotics. Viral video spreads with the so-called word-of-mouth effect, which is actively used by marketing companies. YouTube, Funny or Die, and others were the first channels for distributing this type of video, and now almost any video hosting service contains a collection of viral videos, while before that such videos were sent by e-mail. One of the very first viral videos, The Spirit of Christmas, was made in 1995. In 1996, the video “Dancing baby” was released as an example of 3D character visualization. A viral video usually contains some kind of clue, a point that attracts the attention of viewers. Such clues can then continue to spread on the Internet even beyond the video itself, turning into a meme. Recently, due to the fact that digital technology has become accessible to everyone, there has been a big increase in viral videos, mainly on platforms such as Youtube. ==Manifestations== ===Internet celebrities=== Websites such as YouTube often create internet celebrities, people who have become popular because of videos they make in their homes and beyond. Sometimes the spread of such videos has unexpected consequences: thanks to videos from various sources that have gone viral, many online celebrities have become popular offline. ===Music promotion=== Youtube has played a big role in the careers of many musicians. Many independent musicians as well as large companies use video hosting to promote their videos. The Free Hugs Campaign, which used the music of the Sick Puppies, brought popularity to both the company and the band, and started similar campaigns around the world. ==Education== Viral videos are often used for educational purposes. In March 2007, schoolteacher Jason Smith created TeacherTube, a site that now has more than 54,000 educational videos available. ==Related pages== * Internet meme * The Streisand effect ==References== * CMU Viral Videos [] Public data for the study of viral video. * Viral Video Chart [] Guardian News, UK. * Photos Gone Viral!
