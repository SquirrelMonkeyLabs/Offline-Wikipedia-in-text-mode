 "text": "Blind Faith was an English blues-rock band. It was formed in 1968 by members of other bands. Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker had been in the band Cream. Steve Winwood and Rick Grech had been in the band Traffic. Many people had high expectations but the new band was only together for about one year. The name of the band came about as a result of the \"blind faith\" shown by many people. These people had thought that the band would go on to greatness. Before they broke up in 1969, they released a self-titled album. It caused controversy because it only had six songs and featured a topless teenage girl holding a toy airplane on the English album cover. This image was replaced by a photograph of the band in America. Category:English rock bands Category:Blues bands",
