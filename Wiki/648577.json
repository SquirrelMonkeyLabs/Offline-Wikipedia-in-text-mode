 "text": "Buzzards Bay is a bay next to the southeastern part of the U.S. State of Massachusetts. It is around 28 miles long and eight miles wide. Buzzards Bay is a popular place for tourism, fishing and boating. The name was given to this bay by colonists who saw a large bird they called a buzzard near the shores. But it was really an osprey. Towns on Buzzards Bay were hit hardest by the effects of Hurricane Bob in August 1991. Category:Bays of the United States Category:Geography of Massachusetts",
