(Hungarian: Nemzeti Szocialista Magyar Munkáspárt, NSZMP) was a Nazi party founded by Zoltán Böszörmény. It operated between May 2, 1932, and June 3, 1936. This party was active in Hungary during a time when far-right ideas were growing in Europe. Its leader, aimed to spread Nazi beliefs, inspired by similar movements like the Nazis in Germany. The party tried to gain support among Hungarian workers and farmers but was eventually banned by the government in 1936 due to its extreme views and actions. It was a small but notable part of Hungary's political scene before World War II. == History == The party was the first Hungarian Nazi party to gain significant social support. The organization was initially established around 1930–1931, but actual organizing efforts only began at the very end of 1931. After the Hungarian Royal Interior Minister, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, banned the swastika in September 1933 as the official symbol of the Third Reich in Hungary, the party began using the scythe cross instead. The party was banned on June 3, 1936. == Resources == * Zoltán Paksy: The formation, activities and social base of the Hungarian National Socialist movements in Transdanubia (PhD dissertation, University of Pécs, Faculty of Humanities) * Encyclopedia of Hungarian Political Parties 1846-2010, Budapest, Gondolat Publishing House, 2011. , 234-235. he. * Kálmán Szakács: Grim Reapers, Kossuth, Budapest. , 1963 ==References== Category:Nazism Category:Defunct political parties in Hungary",
