 "text": "Arp Schnitger (born 2 July 1648; buried 28 July 1719) was a very important German builder of pipe organs. He mostly worked in Northern Europe, especially the Netherlands and Germany, where a number of his instruments survive to the present day. His organs are different from those of Gottfried Silbermann who worked in south Germany. Arp Schnitger had great influence on later organ builders, in particular in the 20th century when people wanted a change from the Romantic 19th century organs and tried to make instruments that sounded like they had done in the Baroque period. ==Gallery== File:Zwolle Sint- Michaëlskerk Schnitger Orgel.JPG|The great organ of Sint-Michaëlskerk (St. Michael Church), Zwolle, The Netherlands.
