Sometimes the coiner is the only person who has ever used the word. Sometimes people create protologisms because of a gap in the language. In April 2024, Isaiah Ogedegbe created in the Nigerian Pidgin a protologism called 'mugubriosity' when he wrote that: \"In what could be described as a show of 'mugubriosity' (my Pidgin English word for foolishness), Nigerians love celebrating the dead while taking the living for granted\". ==Related pages== *Neologism ==References== Category:Words",
