 "text": "Ruby Ridge was the area involved in an eleven-day siege around Naples, Idaho between August 21â€“31, 1992. It started on Friday, August 21, when deputies working for the United States Marshals Service (USMS) took action to arrest Randy Weaver with a bench warrant. Weaver had failed to appear in court on firearms charges. When he was given several conflicting dates for appearing in court, and while a conspiracy was linked with him, Weaver did not wish to surrender. Members with his immediate family, and his family friend, Kevin Harris, also resisted. The Hostage Rescue Team under the Federal Bureau of Investigation got involved after the siege developed. When the Marshals Service explored the Weaver property, six U.S. Marshals encountered Harris and Sammy Weaver (Randy's 14-year-old son) in the woods near the family cabin. A shootout then took place. Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, Sammy Weaver and the Weavers' family dog Striker were killed. During the following siege in the Weaver family residence, Weaver's wife Vicki was killed by the FBI sniper fire. The siege and standoff were resolved through civilian negotiators. Harris was arrested on August 30. Weaver and his three daughters were arrested the following day. The events that took place in and around Naples, Idaho and the law enforcement based Waco siege six months later were cited by commentators as warning signs for the Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols in April 1995. ==References== Category:History of Idaho Category:August events Category:1992 events Category:1992 in the United States",
