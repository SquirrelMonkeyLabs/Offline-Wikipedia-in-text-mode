 "text": "Mark Thomas Pavelich (February 28, 1958 â€“ March 4, 2021) was an American professional ice hockey forward. He played 355 regular season games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers, Minnesota North Stars, and San Jose Sharks between 1981 until 1991. Pavelich was a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal in what has been called the \"Miracle on Ice\". Pavelich was arrested on August 15, 2019, after allegedly assaulting and seriously injuring a neighbor with whom he'd earlier been fishing. He was charged with four felony counts. On December 4, 2019 the court ruled that Pavelich was mentally ill and dangerous and ordered him committed to a secure treatment facility. It was believed that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Pavelich died on March 4, 2021, at a residential treatment center in Sauk Centre, Minnesota at the age of 63. He is the second member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to die, the first being Bob Suter. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Deaths from chronic traumatic encephalopathy Category:New York Rangers players Category:Minnesota North Stars players Category:San Jose Sharks players Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States Category:Sportspeople from Minnesota",
