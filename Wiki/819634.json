 "text": "The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (; ; ) was a country that was created in October 1918, in Southeast Europe. Before that, its land was a part of Austria-Hungary, as well as Serbia and Montenegro. Four Bulgarian territories were also added to the state in 1919. When Austria-Hungary lost the World War I, it was broken up. The Treaty of Saint Germain-en-Laye (Austria) and the Treaty of Trianon (Hungary) dealt with the transfer of territory from the dissolved Austro-Hungarian Empire to the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Slovenes, Croats and Serbs are slavic peoples that lived in the south of Austria-Hungary. Their leaders and representatives wanted their people to come together and live in one country. In December 1918, soon after it was created, it joined the Kingdom of Serbia where many Serbs were already independent. This new country became the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes which changed its name to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was independent for a very short time. During this time, other states didn't recognize it, but they soon recognized the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes.
