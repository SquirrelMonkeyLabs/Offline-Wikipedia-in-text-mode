 "text": "The analog hole (also known as the analog loophole or analog gap) is a vulnerability in copy protection systems for digital formats. It can be used to copy protected works using analog means. When digital information is changed to a form that can by seen or heard by people, it is easy to recapture that analog version in a form that is not protected. This can be done to bypass any restrictions placed on copyrighted digital work. Publishers who use digital rights management (DRM) to limit how a work can be used admit that the need to make something be able to be seen or heard is a \"hole\" in the protection that DRM gives them . == References == Category:Copyright infringement",
