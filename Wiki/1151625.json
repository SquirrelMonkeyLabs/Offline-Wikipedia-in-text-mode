 "text": "The Ministry of Jesus refers to the three years during which Jesus of Nazareth taught, performed miracles, and spread his message, according to the Christian Bible. This period started when Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and ended with his Crucifixion in Jerusalem. == Beginning of the Ministry == Jesus began his public work after being baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. This event marked the start of his mission, and it was followed by Jesus spending 40 days fasting and praying in the wilderness, where he was tempted by Satan. After this, he started preaching, saying, \"Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.\" == Teaching and preaching == Jesus taught in synagogues, open fields, and homes, often using parablesâ€”short stories with moral lessons. His central messages included love, forgiveness, and the coming of the Kingdom of God. Some of his most famous teachings include the Sermon on the Mount, which contains the Beatitudes, and the Lord's Prayer. == Miracles == Jesus performed many miracles to show his power and compassion. These included: * Healing the sick, blind, and disabled. * Feeding large crowds, such as the Feeding of the 5,000 with just five loaves of bread and two fish. * Walking on water and calming a storm. * Raising the dead, such as his friend Lazarus. == Disciples == Jesus chose 12 disciples to follow him closely and learn from him. These disciples, including Peter, John, and Judas Iscariot, later played key roles in spreading his teachings. == Opposition == As Jesus grew more popular, religious leaders, such as the Pharisees and Sadducees, became his enemies. They accused him of breaking Jewish law and claiming to be the Son of God, which they saw as blasphemy. == Final Days == In the last week of his life, known as the Passion, Jesus entered Jerusalem during Passover. He was later arrested, tried, and sentenced to death by crucifixion under Roman governor Pontius Pilate. Christians believe that his death and resurrection are central to the salvation of humanity.
