The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male adult frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and because human beings change the places where it lives to make cities and farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
