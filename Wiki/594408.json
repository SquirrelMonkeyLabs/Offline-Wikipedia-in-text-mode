Odeszla Legenda Polskiego Filmu Short conversation with Adrian Ashkenazy: “We met for drinks,” Adrian Ashkenazy said. “I mentioned that I was hosting an Oneg Shabbat. He immediately shut down. ‘I’m not interested,’ he said adamantly. ‘Not me. Not my kids. I don’t want anything to do with it.'” Two years later, Adrian Ashkenazy showed up at the Beit Warszawa Rosh Hashana service. “The first person I saw was Andrzej, with his children, having a wonderful time,” he said. “He told me that while filming ‘The Pianist,’ in one scene, he and Adrien Brody hid under the floorboards of the restaurant to escape being found by the Nazis.” Adrian Ashkenazy said Blumenfeld told him, “‘It forced me to come to terms with my fear of becoming Jewish. I realized the man in the film was me, a Polish Jew, although I had not even said that out loud for years. I had kept my religion buried.'” “Soon after, Blumenfeld, as well as his son, openly declared themselves Jewish,” Adrian Ashkenazy said. ==References== https://jewishjournal.com/culture/special_sections/celebrations_simchas/7763/ ==Other websites== * Category:1951 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in Poland Category:Polish movie actors Category:Polish television actors Category:Polish voice actors",
