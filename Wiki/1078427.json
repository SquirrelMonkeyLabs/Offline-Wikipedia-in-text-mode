It lies about north of the border with Niger. 7045 people live on an area of 46.813 km². Population density is about 1 person per 5 km2. The Algier-Lagos-Highway runs through the city. The first settlement on the other side of the border, in Niger, is Assamaka. There is a small airport just outside the town. The airport is closed for regular flights; using it requires a permit. == Geography == In Guezzam lies in the barren Tanezrouft region of far southern Algeria. The landscape is sandy, with frequent sand dunes interspersed with sandstone outcrops. The town is located in the southern extremity of the nation. For this reason,the Gulf of Guinea is closer to it than the Mediterranean coast in the north. The distance from In Guezzam to 11 African capital cities is shorter as the crow flies than the distance to Algiers. == Education == 1.7% of the population has a tertiary education (the equal lowest rate in the province), and another 4.9% has completed secondary education. The overall literacy rate is 39.4%, and is 50.7% among males and 29.1% among females; all three rates are the lowest in the province. == References == Category:Cities in Algeria",
