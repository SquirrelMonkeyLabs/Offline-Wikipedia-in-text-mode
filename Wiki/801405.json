 "text": "The Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method is a way of measuring the value of the runs scored by both teams in a limited overs cricket game when one team's scoring turn is made shorter than the other team's scoring turn because the game has been shortened midway (such as due to a rain delay). For example, if one team bats for 100 deliveries in their scoring turn, and then rain stops the game, the time remaining in the game may only allow the second team to receive a maximum of 50 deliveries. Therefore the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method is used to calculate a fair target for the second team considering the reduced remaining deliveries in the game. The DLS formula also looks at the number of batters that are out on a team when re-calculating the target score for the team batting second. . == References == Category:Cricket statistics",
