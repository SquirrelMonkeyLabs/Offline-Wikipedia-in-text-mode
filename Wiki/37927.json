 "text": "The Commonwealth Games is a multinational, multi-sport event. Held every four years, it involves the elite athletes of the Commonwealth of Nations. Attendance at the Commonwealth Games is typically around 5,000 athletes. The idea for a competition between members of the British Empire was first suggested by the Reverend Astley Cooper in 1891. The first such event, then known as the British Empire Games, was held in 1930. The name changed to British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1954, to British Commonwealth Games in 1970 and assumed the current name of the Commonwealth Games in 1978. == Editions == The following cities have hosted the Commonwealth Games, and their predecessors === British Empire Games === * 1930 British Empire Games - Hamilton, Ontario, Canada * 1934 British Empire Games - London, England * 1938 British Empire Games - Sydney, New South Wales, Australia * 1950 British Empire Games - Auckland, New Zealand === British Empire and Commonwealth Games === * 1954 - Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada * 1958 - Cardiff, Wales * 1962 - Perth, Australia * 1966 - Kingston, Jamaica === British Commonwealth Games === * 1970 - Edinburgh, Scotland * 1974 - Christchurch, New Zealand === Commonwealth Games === * 1978 - Edmonton, Canada * 1982 - Brisbane, Australia * 1986 - Edinburgh, Scotland * 1990 - Auckland, New Zealand * 1994 - Victoria, Canada * 1998 - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia * 2002 - Manchester, England * 2006 - Melbourne, Australia * 2010 - Delhi, India * 2014 - Glasgow, Scotland * 2018 - Gold Coast, Australia * 2022 - Birmingham, England ==Related pages== * List of Commonwealth Games cities Category:1930 establishments Category:Multi-sport events",
