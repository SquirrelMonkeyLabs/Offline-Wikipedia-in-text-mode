 "text": "Druidism or Druidry (referred to as Neodruidry or Neodruidism by some followers) is a Celtic form of modern spirituality that generally promotes harmony with nature, often through the form of nature worship. It is considered to be a Neopagan faith. Originally inspired by 17th, 18th and 19th century romantic movements, early neo-druidism was based upon largely historically incorrect depictions of the Iron Age Celtic druids, and has no direct relation to the ancient Celts or their culture.\"Modern Druids have no direct connection to the Druids of the Iron Age. Many of our popular ideas about the Druids are based on the misunderstandings and misconceptions of scholars 200 years ago. These ideas have been superseded by later study and discoveries.\" Druids are also known to be very close with nature. ==Beliefs and Practises== Neo-druidic beliefs vary wildly, and there is no set dogma or belief system by which all adherents follow. Main beliefs include the Earth and nature are sacred, and is worthy of worship itself. For this reason many druids are pantheistic, animistic, or polytheistic. == Related pages == *Celts *Druid *Stonehenge == References == == More reading == * * Category:New religious movements",
