 "text": "George Turner (2 April 1841 â€“ 29 Mar 1910) was an English landscape artist and farmer. He was also called \"Derbyshire's John Constable\". ==Life and work== Turner was born in Cromford, Derbyshire in England, then moved to Derby with his family. His father Thomas Turner was a tailer and favoured art works, so he adviced his son to learn art and music. Turner made progress mainly by himself, and became a professional painter and art teacher. Turner lived in Derbyshire all his life. In 1865 he married Eliza Lakin (1837 - 1900), and worked as a part-time farmer raising four children at Walnut farm in Barrow upon Trent.George and Eliza Turner had four children: Mary Turner (later Chamberlain then Woore) (1868-1937), Florence Palmer Turner (1869-1955), William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) and Percy Reed Turner (1871 - 1936). After Eliza's death in 1900, he moved to Kirk Ireton and later married fellow artist Kate Stevens Smith (1871-1964) - they set up home in Idridgehay, and he died there in 1910. His son William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) also became a famous landscape oil painter. Most of Turner's paintings are of Derbyshire where he lived. They show old English countryside before the coming of modernization. His work was exhibited in Nottingham and Birmingham. Turner was a member of the Art Committee of Derby Art Gallery and the city has both his and his son's paintings. == Notes == == Further reading == *Long, Frederick J.
