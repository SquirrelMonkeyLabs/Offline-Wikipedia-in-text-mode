 "text": "An acute angle (\"acute\" meaning \"small\") is an angle smaller than a right angle. The range of an acute angle is between 0 and 90 degrees, or between 0 and \\frac{\\pi}{2} radians. Angles larger than a right angle (90 degrees) are called obtuse. They are found exclusively in Quadrant I or a graph, due to the terminal arm not being able to leave this Quadrant without becoming too large. ==Related == * Obtuse angle * Right angle Category:Angles",
