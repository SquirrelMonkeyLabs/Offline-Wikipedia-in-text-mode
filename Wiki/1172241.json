 "text": "Silesauridae was a family of non-dinosaur dinosauriforms during the Triassic period. They are now extinct. The Silesauridae family is often viewed as the sister group of dinosaurs and a clade of non-dinosaur dinosauriforms. However, some research has proposed that most silesaurids were either a paraphyletic grade or an early diverging clade of ornithischian dinosaurs. Silesaurids had a relatively long neck and legs, and probably had quadrupedal behaviors. They filled a range of ecological niches. Early silesaurids like Lewisuchus were carnivorous. Later species like Kwanasaurus could also eat plants. Some silesaurids may have also been insectivores, eating tiny beetles and other arthropods. Silesaurids filled a range of ecological niches. ==References== Category:Archosaurs",
