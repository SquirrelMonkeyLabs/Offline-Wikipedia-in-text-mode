The current president of the university is George E. Ross. ==Sports== The athletics teams of the university are called the Chippewas. They have 16 varsity teams, all but one of which competes in the Mid-American Conference (MAC). The only exception is the women's lacrosse team. Because CMU is the only MAC member that plays women's lacrosse, that team plays in the Atlantic Sun Conference. ==Other websites== *Central Michigan University's Official website *Central Michigan Chippewas' Official athletics website Category:Mid- American Conference Category:Colleges and universities in Michigan Category:1892 establishments in the United States Category:1890s establishments in Michigan",
