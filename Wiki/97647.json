About 17% of all asteroids are this type of asteroid, meaning that they are the second most common after C-type asteroids. S-type asteroids are the most common asteroid in the inner main belt, but become very rare farther out in space. The biggest asteroid of this type is 15 Eunomia. S-type asteroids are the most mineral dense asteroids. Category:Asteroids",
