 "text": "A siloxane is a molecule containing two silicon atoms connected by chemical bonds to one oxygen atom. The term properly only means compounds containing oxygen, silicon, and hydrogen, but is often expanded to include compounds with organic substituents like alkyl groups. Polymeric siloxanes are called silicones. Silicones are important in making many kinds of plastic and rubber. == Sources == Category:Silicon compounds Category:Functional groups",
