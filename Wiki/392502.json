 "text": "Pruners are a cutting tool for pruning plants. A common form is held in one hand; it is also called snippers or secateurs. It has two handles, one connected to a blade and the other to a blunt surface. Like the word scissors, pruners is used as a plural. A pole pruner is like a pair of pruners, but at the end of a pole. It is operated by pulling on a rope. Pruners are used for cutting plants and small branches, such as roses and grapevines. Stems thicker than a pencil will need to be cut with loppers or a saw instead. Category:Cutting tools Category:Gardening tools",
