An early example of an oar mounted on the stern is found in the Egyptian tomb of Menna (1422-1411 BC).William F. Edgerton 1927. Ancient Egyptian Steering Gear. American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures 43, (4), 255. Stern-mounted oars were also quite common in Roman river navigation as proved from reliefs more than a millennium later.
