 "text": "In psychology, father complex, also called daddy issues, is a group of unconscious associations or impulses related to a fatherly figure. These impulses may be either positive (wanting older men) or negative (fearful). ==Freud vs. Jung== Sigmund Freud (and psychoanalysts after him) saw the father complex as an aspect of the Oedipus complex.Jon E. Roeckelein, Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories (2006) p. 111 In contrast, Carl Jung believed that both men and women had a father complex.Mary Ann Mattoon, Jung and the Human Psyche (2005) p. 91 ==Examples== The concept of father complex is a common theme in popular culture. For instance, Czesław Miłosz wrote of Albert Einstein,Czeslaw Milosz, Native Realm (1981) p. 282 Bob Dylan's choice of his acting name has been linked to the father complex, as a rejection of his actual father and his paternal name.Daniel Karlin, in Neil Corcoran ed., Do You, Mr Jones? (London 2002) p. 41Craig McGregor ed., Bob Dylan: A Retrospective (1975) p.44 before leaving each one behind again in turn.bob dylan, poem to joannie (1972) p. 7-8 Meanwhile, English novelist D. H.
