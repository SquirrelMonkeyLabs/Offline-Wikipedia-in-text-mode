 "text": "The House of Representatives, Dutch: Tweede Kamer (literally Second Chamber), is the lower house of the States General, the parliament of the Netherlands. It is comparable with the House of Representatives in other countries, because it is chosen by direct elections. It consists of 150 members, who are chosen every four years or earlier when the government has been brought down. In contrast with the First Chamber or Senate the Second Chamber has extensive legislative powers. == House of Representatives 2021-2023 == The elections for the new House of Representatives were held on Wednesday 17 March 2021. The new House was installed on 31 March 2021. Twenty parliamentary groups had been present in the House since March 2022 (originally 17). Parties with considerable gains were the progressive liberal party D66, the populist parties FVD and JA21, and newcomer Volt. Considerable losses had been suffered by the Christian democratic party CDA, the left parties GL and SP, the populist party PVV, and the senior party 50+. BBB and BIJ1 had made their first appearance in parliament. On 6 May 2021, Liane den Haan left 50+ and became an independent MP. On 13 May 2021, Wybren van Haga and two other MPs left FVD and became the Group Van Haga. On 12 June 2021, Pieter Omtzigt left the CDA and became an independent MP.
