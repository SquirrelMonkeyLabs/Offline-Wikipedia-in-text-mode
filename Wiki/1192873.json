 "text": "Nathaneo Johnson (born 31 October 2003) is a tech entrepreneur who is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Series, an AI-powered social networking platform. He is currently a junior at Yale University studying Computer Science and Economics. In 2025, Johnson and his co-founder, Sean Hargrow, raised $3.1 million in pre-seed funding for Series. == Early life and entrepreneurship == Johnson was born on 31 October 2003 in Irvine, California. He demonstrated an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age, as by eight years old he had created a walking stick for the visually impaired. Johnson developed a social app called Prowledge which gained recognition from Princeton for their Prize in Race Relations and later began to develop Cube Satellites. Later, he built an app that gained national recognition from an MIT Hacker award during his freshman year at University High School. He also built robots and participated in statewide technological competitions. Standing at 6 feet 5 inches, Johnson also played competitive basketball, becoming team captain of the Varsity senior year and helped lead his team to the CIF-SS quarterfinals. Upon completing high school, he spent his summer before college building another social platform called Mix26 to help incoming college freshmen navigate orientation events. While in college soon after Mix26 gained popularity amongst the freshman class at Yale University. Johnson started The Founder Series Podcast with another Yale student. Both interviewed students and founders about entrepreneurship. Sean, who was the creative director of the podcast, soon joined Nathaneo to conceptualize a startup around the concept of qualitative connections. Johnson later started a venture fund along with another Yale student Albert Yang his freshman year. == Career == === BullMont Capital === Before starting and becoming the CEO of Series, Nathaneo co-founded BullMont Capital in his freshman year, a student investment fund for student founders. Bullmont Capital is a venture studio for college founders that aims to democratize access to funding for college students. BullMont has made six investments to date and has played a contributing role towards student venture, with Johnson serving as the current president. == Series == Series functions as an “AI-powered social network” where users interact with an “AI Friend,” a chatbot that helps identify valuable networking connections within the platform. Johnson described the platform’s mission as “engineering serendipity” by enabling people to meet others who offer mutual value, such as mentors, co-founders, or investors, rather than boosting follower counts. Johnson publicly differentiated Series from traditional social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, arguing that the existing paradigm of online validation is outdated. He described the venture as a “direct foil to the Harvard story,” referencing the founding of Facebook by Harvard students, and emphasized Series’ aim to build a new narrative for underrepresented founders in tech. == Fundraising and growth == In early 2025, Johnson and Hargrow raised $3.1 million in pre-seed funding in just 14 days after Johnson posted a trailer for Series on LinkedIn that went viral within the college entrepreneurial community. The round was led by former Andreessen Horowitz partner Anne Lee Skates, now with Parable VC. Other participants included Pear VC, DGB.VC, 47th Street, Radicle Impact, Uncommon Projects, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, and GPTZero founder Edward Tian. The funding allowed the founders to grow the platform’s team, expand outreach to universities across the United States, and launch premium membership offerings. As of early 2025, Series reported over 20,000 messages exchanged on the platform within a single week. == Public perception and impact == Johnson’s work has been recognized for challenging traditional norms in Silicon Valley and higher education. Along with Hargrow, he has openly discussed the bias they faced as tall Black men on Yale’s campus, often mistaken for athletes rather than entrepreneurs. Their visibility have been cited as a source of inspiration for aspiring minority founders. He has spoken about the importance of democratizing access to high-value networks and fostering a more inclusive tech landscape. “We’re setting the records at Yale, and we just happen to be Black,” Johnson told campus media, emphasizing the significance of representation in entrepreneurship. == Education == Johnson studied at the University High School and as of May 2025, he is enrolled as an undergraduate at Yale University, where he is currently pursuing Computer Science and Economics. == External Links == * Series Official Website * Bullmont Capital == References == Category:Living people Category:2003 births Category:American computer scientists Category:Podcasters Category:American chief executives Category:American company founders Category:Social networking services Category:Social networking Category:Yale University",
