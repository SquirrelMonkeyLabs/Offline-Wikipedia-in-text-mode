 "text": "BET Jams is an American pay television channel airing hip-hop and urban contemporary music videos on a thrice-daily automated wheel schedule of eight hours outside of temporary \"roadblock\" closures during Paramount Global's awards events, with all of its programming currently denoted in hour blocks as BET Jams â€“ Music Videos within electronic program guide listings. The channel launched on May 1, 2002, as MTV Jams, and carried that name until October 5, 2015, and was placed under BET's purview as MTV drifted away from music programming along with 106 & Park. MTV Jams Hits, a compliation album based on the channel, was released in June 2002 by Columbia and Epic. The network space itself launched on August 1, 1998, as MTVX, carrying modern rock videos, and was re-focused around hip-hop music on that date, to some controversy from MTVX's former viewers.
