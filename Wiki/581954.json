 "text": "Errol Leonard Norstedt (June 17, 1948 â€“ January 17, 2002), better known by his stage name Eddie Meduza, was a Swedish musician working mainly in the rockabilly genre. His songs were about women, cars and alcohol, often associated with obscene lyrics. He went as far as to aim his views at the Swedish Government which garnered controversy over the years. Meduza died at the age of 53 after suffering a heart attack caused by alcohol poisoning. He is remembered for his explicit work but many of his songs were ironic-made and contained clever social commentary. Meduza is survived by wife and (now adult) children. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official Web page Category:Swedish musicians Category:1948 births Category:2002 deaths",
