 "text": "A terasecond (symbol: Ts) is one trillion seconds. That is about 31,700 years. It can be written as 1012 seconds. Here is a list of time spans longer than 1 terasecond: * 1015 seconds = 1 petasecond = 31.7 million years * 1018 seconds = 1 exasecond = 31.7 billion years * 1021 seconds = 1 zettasecond = 31.7 trillion years * 1024 seconds = 1 yottasecond = 31.7 quadrillion years * 1027 seconds = 1 ronnasecond = 31.7 quintillion years * 1030 seconds = 1 quettasecond = 31.7 sextillion years == Teraseconds == Here are some examples of events that take this long: * 75,000 years — time since the ancestors of the Indigenous Australians reached Australia * 76,000 years — half-life of nickel-59 * 154,000 years — half-life of neptunium-236 * 159,200 years — half- life of uranium-233 * 200,000 years — age of Homo sapiens * 211,100 years — half-life of technetium-99 * 250,000 years — age of Homo neanderthalensis * 301,000 years — half-life of chlorine-36 * 340,000 years -- half-life of curium-248 * 379,000 years -- time after the Big Bang until cosmic microwave background radiation began * ~700,000 years -- time since the earth's magnetic field last changed * 1,000,000 years -- the lifespan of a blue supergiant star * 1,530,000 years -- half-life of zirconium-93 * 2,600,000 years -- amount of time the Paleolithic era lasted * 2,600,000 years -- half-life of technetium-97 * 3.74 million years -- half-life of manganese-53 * 4 million years -- time since the last ice age * 4.2 million years -- half-life of technetium-98 * 6.5 million years -- half-life of palladium-107 * 15.6 million years -- half-life of curium-247 * 20 million years -- time since the first forms of grass appeared * 23.42 million years -- half-life of uranium-236 * 26 million years -- time since the first elephants were born == Petaseconds == * 34 million years -- time since the evolution of the cat * 34.7 million years -- half-life of niobium-92 * 49 million years -- time since the whales returned to the water * 60 million years -- time since the evolution of the first primates. * 135 million years -- time since end of Jurassic and beginning of Cretaceous period * 250 million years -- Galactic year - an orbit around the center of the Milky way of our Sun and the Solar system * 251.4 million years -- time since the Permian–Triassic extinction event * 280 million years -- time since end of Carboniferous and beginning of Permian Period. * 390 million years - first fishapods * 575 million years - age of the oldest animal fossils * 580 million years - time since the end of a possible Snowball Earth ice age * 703.8 million years - half-life of uranium-235 * 750 million years - time since the beginning of a possible ice age * 1277 million years - half-life of potassium-40 * 1.8-2.1 billion years - age of the earliest eukaryotes * 2.3 billion years - time since the first known ice age * 3.5 to 3.8 billion years - age of oldest records of life: stromatolites and cyanobacteria * 4.468 billion years - half-life of uranium-238 * 4.5 billion years - age of the Earth * 13.7 ± 0.2 billion years (4e17 seconds) - age of the universe according to the Big Bang theory * 20 billion years - time until the end of the universe in the Big Rip scenario == Exaseconds == * 100 billion (1011) years -- If the universe is closed, the lifetime of the universe * Some radioisotopes have very long half-lives: ** (1.4 ± 0.4) × 1017 years – vanadium-50 ** (1.9 ± 0.2) × 1019 years – bismuth-209 ** (3.1 ± 0.4) × 1019 years – cadmium-116 ** (2.2 ± 0.3) × 1024 years – tellurium-128 Category:Orders of magnitude Category:Units of time",
