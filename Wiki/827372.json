 "text": "The Davy Medal is given by the Royal Society of London \"for an outstandingly important recent discovery in any branch of chemistry\". The medal is named after Humphry Davy. The medal is given with money. The amount you would be given was £1000 but it is now £2000. == History == The medal was first given in 1877 to Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff \"for their researches & discoveries in spectrum analysis\", and has since been given 140 times. The medal is given yearly and, unlike other Royal Society medals (such as the Hughes), has always been given every year without a break. On 1882, it was given to Dmitri Mendeleev and Julius Lothar Meyer \"for their discovery of the periodic relations of the atomic weights\". The 2020 award was to Ben G. Davis for \"inventing powerful chemical methods that... manipulate complex biological molecules\" (etc). == List of recipients == Source: Royal Society Year Name Rationale Notes 1877 and \"For their
