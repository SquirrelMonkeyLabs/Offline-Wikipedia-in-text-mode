 "text": "Sulphur-crested cockatoos (binomial name Cacatua galerita) are large white parrots with yellow heads and tails. There are four subspecies of the bird. They live in Australian forests. Farmers do not like sulphur-crested cockatoos because the cockatoos eat vegetables that the farmers have grown. They are a protected species, but sometimes get shot. Many people like sulphur-crested cockatoos and keep them as pets. They are very loud and have a natural desire to chew wood and other materials. They are very long-lived. In captivity they can live to 70 years. One cockatoo called Fred was still alive at 100 years of age in 2014. == References == Category:Birds of Australia Category:Cockatoos",
