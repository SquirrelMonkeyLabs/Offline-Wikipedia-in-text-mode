 "text": "\"There you go again\" was a phrase spoken during the 1980 United States presidential election debate. It was said by Republican presidential candidate Governor Ronald Reagan to his Democratic opponent, then-current President Jimmy Carter. Reagan would use the line in a few debates over the years, always in a way intended to disarm his opponent. ==References== Category:1980 in the United States Category:Speeches by Ronald Reagan",
