 "text": "Taxation in the Republic of Ireland is very progressive. The top 10% of earners pay 60% of the taxes. As well as income tax on earnings there is the Universal Social Charge and Pay Related Social Insurance. Value added tax is charged on almost all goods and services. Corporation tax is very important in Ireland and foreign multinationals pay about 80% of it. It is only 12.5% - much lower than most developed countries so many of the biggest American technology and pharmaceutical companies keep the money from intellectual property rights in their Irish subsidiaries. This makes the Irish economy seem much bigger than it really is. == References == Category:Taxation in the Republic of Ireland",
