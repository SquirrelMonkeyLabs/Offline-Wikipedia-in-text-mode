 "text": "The Latin Grammy Awards are awards given yearly by the Latin Recording Academy (an association of professionals who work in the Latin music industry) for outstanding work in the Latin music field. The award process is very similar to its American counterpart, the Grammy Awards. The Latin Grammy Awards was created because its organizers thought that the many musical styles of Latin music was too big to fit on the Grammy Awards. The Latin Grammy Awards focuses on music released in Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and the United States. One major difference between the Grammy Awards and the Latin Grammy Awards is that a recording that does not have to be released in the United States. To be considered for a Latin Grammy nomination, the song or album must be sung in Spanish or Portuguese. ==References== == Other websites == * Official site Category:Music awards Category:Latin music",
