 "text": "== What is Spin Ice? == Spin ice is a magnetic crystal. It is also known as a microcontroller. It does not have a minimal-energy state which means that it does not rest at one place but instead fluctuates, in this case it is its magnetism that is moving. This is because the atoms inside of its crystal structure are always moving and cannot physically rest in one position. In its stable form it will continue to exhibit magnetic fluctuations at some frequency. Affects connected electrical systems and vice versa when a current is applied. Spin ice is therefore like a battery for magnetic moments that would eventually melt after expending its energy. == Recipe for Spin Ice == With a massive amount of energy we can create a crystal. To make spin ice scientists have used tiny magnets inside of complex crystals. Category:Science Category:Magnetism",
