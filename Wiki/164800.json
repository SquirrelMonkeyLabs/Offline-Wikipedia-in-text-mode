 "text": "Hassocks is a large village in West Sussex, England. It can be found about north of Brighton, and nearly 7000 people live there. Hassocks has grown since the 19th century, when work started on the London to Brighton railway. The village became better known after 2 April 1839 when the first railway line was laid between London and Brighton. Over 6,000 workmen were hired for up to two years building, blasting and clearing rubble beneath the South Downs to create Clayton Tunnel. It is the second longest tunnel on the London to Brighton Line, some 1¼ miles long and below ground. The opening of Hassocks Gate as the railway station in 1841 saw the beginning of the village that is known today. In 1861 there was a collision between two trains, which killed 23 people and injured 176 others. == Recent history == Today Hassocks has lots of shops and a well-used community centre called Adastra Hall. It is quite expensive to buy a house in Hassocks, though it is not quite as expensive as neighbouring Ditchling and Hurstpierpoint. These villages have many nice, older buildings whereas Hassocks village centre was mainly built after World War Two. == Railway station == Hassocks railway station serves the village.
