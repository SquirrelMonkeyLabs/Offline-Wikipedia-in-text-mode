 "text": "The Estates-General of 1789 was a gathering in France that brought together representatives from three social classes, known as estates: the clergy (First Estate), the nobility (Second Estate), and the common people (Third Estate). King Louis XVI called this meeting to address the financial and societal problems facing the country. However, the Third Estate decided to break away from the kingâ€™s authority and formed a National Assembly. This event is often seen as the beginning of the French Revolution.
