 "text": "Emigration is leaving one's country or area to go live in another. Emigration (leaving) from one country is usually followed by Immigration (coming into) into another. The difference between the two is the perspective (or point of view) of which country a person is leaving and which country they are going to. The urge to migrate is a part of human nature.Ann Katherine Isaacs, Immigration and Emigration in Historical Perspective (Pisa: Edizioni Plus, Pisa University Press, 2007), p. vii People migrated well before we had written history. Emigrants from a place are its diaspora. People who move around all the time are called nomads. == Reasons == Emigration happens for different reasons: * People think that they benefit from moving elsewhere, because they have a better job, or they have a better chance of economic success, or they are economically better off. This kind of migration is generally called economic migration.Joel P. Trachtman, The International Law of Economic Migration: Toward the Fourth Freedom (Kalamazoo, MI: W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, 2009), pp. 4–5 * The climate, or climatic events force people to move. Climatic events include floods, droughts, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This kind of migration is generally known as environmental migration.Étienne Piguet; Antoine Pécoud, Migration and Climate Change (Paris: UNESCO Pub.; Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 2 As an example, people left Plymouth, on the Island of Montserrat, after a series of volcanic eruptions in 1995. * People have disadvantages where they live, often because they have special views or opinions, or they disagree with the majority or those in power. Often they face persecution, for example because of special religious views or because they belong to an ethnic group. Many people emigrated from Europe to what was the \"New World\" because they had religious beliefs that were different from the majority.Michael H. Crawford, Benjamin C. Campbell, Causes and Consequences of Human Migration: An Evolutionary Perspective (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 299 * People who emigrate (or flee) from one country to another, for reasons including armed conflicts or wars are usually called refugees, once they arrive in another country.Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, The State of the World's Refugees, 2000: Fifty Years of Humanitarian Action (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 1–2 * Very often people move to where the rest of their family lives.Steven J. Gold; Stephanie J. Nawyn, Handbook of International Migration (London; New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 283 International law handles the different groups of migrants differently. ==Images== File:GermanEmigrantsBoardingAShipInHamburg.jpg|German emigrants boarding a ship leaving for the US, in Hamburg, in 1850 File:Dorothea Lange, Drought refugees from Oklahoma camping by the roadside, Blythe, California, 1936.jpg|Drought refugees on a roadside in California, in 1936.
