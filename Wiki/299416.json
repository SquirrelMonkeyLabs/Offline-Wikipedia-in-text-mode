He went to Sacred Heart College, Auckland, a Catholic boarding school. In 1971 he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Auckland. It is there that he met Mike Chunn, Robert Gillies, Philip Judd and Noel Crombie. Phil and Tim formed a band called Split Ends, which became Split Enz before they started to tour Australia. Finn recorded his first solo album, Escapade, in 1983. This album was very successful in Australia and New Zealand. Because of this, he decided to leave Split Enz in 1984. The band broke up. In early 1985, Tim moved to London. His second album Big Canoe was not as successful as the first album. He also wrote some music for movies, and acted in a few movies. His role in The Coca-Cola Kid was about five minutes long. He had a bigger role in the movie La Donna della Luna (The Moon Woman). In late 1989, he went to live in Melbourne. He recorded his third album, Tim Finn. In early 1990 he joined Crowded House, the group Neil had formed after Split Enz split up. The band recorded Woodface with him. He left Crowded House after the album. Because of their success, Tim Finn and Neil Finn were made OBE for services to New Zealand music in the 1993 Queen's Birthday Honours List. The album Finn was released in 1995. This was an album made by Neil and Tim as the Finn Brothers. Also in 1995, Finn worked with singers Andy White and Liam Ó Maonlaí. They formed the band ALT. They released the album Altitude. In 2000, the album Together in Concert: Live was recorded featuring Finn, and New Zealand artists Bic Runga, and Dave Dobbyn.
