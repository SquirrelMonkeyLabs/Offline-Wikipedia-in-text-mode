 "text": "ACCOLC (Access Overload Control) was a process in the United Kingdom for limiting mobile telephone use in times of emergencies. It is like the GTPS (Government Telephone Preference Scheme) for landlines. This process allowed the telephone networks to limit access in a specific area to registered numbers only and is normally started by the Police Incident Commander (although it can be invoked by the Cabinet Office). The emergency services are responsible for registering their key numbers in advance. ACCOLC was replaced by MTPAS (Mobile Telecommunication Privileged Access Scheme) in 2009. == Use == ACCOLC was deployed at the Hillsborough disaster. == References == == Other websites == * London Assembly 7 July Review Committee Volume 4 Follow up report Including report on ACCOLC being invoked around Aldgate on 7 July by the City of London Police without reference to GOLD control. * Introduction to Resilient Communications (Cabinet Office).
