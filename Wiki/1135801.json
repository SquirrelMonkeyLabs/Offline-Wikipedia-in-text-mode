 "text": "Hyloxalus spilotogaster is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Body== One adult female frog was 24.0 mm long from nose to rear end. She had disks on her toes for climbing. She had fringed skin on the toes of all four feet. When the frog was dead and in chemicals, the skin of the head and body was brown with some dark brown stripes. The mouth was cream-white in color. The sides of the body were brown with some white marks. There were light brown stripes on the sides of the body from the nose over the eye to where the back legs meet the body. There was a dark brown stripe on each side of the body, below the light brown stripe. The tops of the back legs were light brown with some other brown spots. The rest of the back legs were brown with some white spots. The front legs were light brown with dark brown lines. The belly was cream-white in color with brown spots. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in exactly one place in Utcubamba Province in Amazonas, 2326 meters above sea level. This place is in a part of the Andes Mountains called the Cordillera Col√°n. They saw exactly one female frog and no male frogs. She was on the dead leaves on the ground in a cloud forest. Scientists think that the frog's tadpoles swim in streams, but they did not see any. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. They think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis may have killed many of them because it killed many other frogs in Peru. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
