 "text": "Amorphea are part of a taxonomic large group that contains protists, like Amoebozoa and Obazoa. The ISP, or the International Society of Protistologists (people who study protists) suggested in 2012 that the back term for this large group, Unikont, be changed to Amorphea since the name \"Unikont\" is a synapomorphy that was shown wrong. == Taxonomic revisions in this group == Thomas Cavalier-Smith has offered two new phyla: Sulcozoa, which consists of the subphyla Diphyllatea, Discocelida, Mantamonadidae, Planomonadida and Rigifilida. The effectiveness of this offered taxonomy has yet to be ruled on by the ISP. More work by Cavalier-Smith has exhibited that Sulcozoa is paraphyletic. Apusozoa also looks like it is paraphyletic. Varisulca now includes planomonads, Mantamonas and Collodictyon. ==Clade== ==References== Category:Eukaryotes",
