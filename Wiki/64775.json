 "text": "1,000,000 (1000000, one million or one thousand thousand or million or thousand thousand for short) is a natural number between 999,999 and 1,000,001. The name is derived from Italian, where was 1,000, and 1,000,000 became a \"milione\", as \"a large thousand\". ==Overview== In scientific notation, the number is written as 106. Physical quantities can also be explained using the SI prefix when using SI units. For example, 1 megawatt is 1,000,000 watts (W). The word \"million\" is common to both the short-scale and long-scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems. The million is sometimes used in English as a metaphor for a very large number, as in \"Never in a million years\" and \"You're one in a million\", or as hyperbole, as in \"I have walked a million miles\". ==Examples== * A millionaire is someone who owns at least one million or more units of currency * In computer science a megabyte is equal to a million bytes, or 1,048,576 (1,0242). * In measurement, there are a million millimeters in a kilometer. There are a million meters in a megameter. (A person who travels completely around earth's equator travels 40 megameters). Also, the speed of light travels a million kilometers in around 3 seconds * Il Milione is the title of Marco Polo's narration of his travels in China. The name is supposed to come from Polo's nickname after his tales of riches and multitudes. 1000000",
