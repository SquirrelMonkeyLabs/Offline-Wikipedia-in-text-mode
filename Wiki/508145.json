 "text": "Kratos, the \"Ghost of Sparta\", is a video game character from Sony Santa Monica Studio's God of War series, which is loosely based on Greek mythology. Kratos first appeared in the 2005 video game God of War, which led to the development of six additional games featuring the character as the protagonist. Kratos also appears as the protagonist of the God of War comic series and novels. He has been consistently voiced by Terrence C. Carson, and Antony Del Rio voiced the character as a child in God of War: Ghost of Sparta. Christopher Judge was Kratos' voice actor in God of War (2018) and God of War: Ragnar√∂k. Kratos is depicted as a Spartan warrior in Ancient Greece and son of Zeus (thus making him a demigod) who, after being manipulated into killing his own family by the war god Ares, goes on a crusade in search of revenge.
