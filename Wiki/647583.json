He informally served as an adviser to his older brother, President Bingu wa Mutharika, on issues of foreign and domestic policy from the onset of his election campaign until the President's death on 5 April 2012. In August 2021, the Constitutional Court examines an appeal lodged by the Progressive Democratic Party of Peter Mutharika. He calls for the cancellation of the 2020 presidential election because four of his representatives had been banned from sitting on the Electoral Commission. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Malawi",
