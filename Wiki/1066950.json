 "text": "Secondary growth is a term in botany. It usually occurs in dicots and gymnosperms. It makes the stems and roots thicker. It is one of the features of trees whereby they come to have long lives. Monocots and Pteridophytes usually lack secondary thickening, with the exception of Isoetes. That is a quillwort, a genus of lycopods. Category:Botany",
