 "text": "Discworld is a series of fantasy books by the English author Terry Pratchett (1948-2015). There are 41 novels in total as well as short stories and guidebooks. All of them are set on the Discworld, which is a flat planet balanced on the back of four elephants who stand on the back of a giant turtle. Make believe creatures like dragons, dwarves and elves live on the Discworld. ==Storylines== The Discworld books follow lots of different characters and storylines. Sometimes, the same main characters are used in several books to create a story arc: ===Rincewind=== Rincewind was the first main character in Discworld books. He is a wizard who does not know any spells and tries to run away from everything. Even though he is a coward, he saves the world several times by accident. ===Death=== Death is seen in all the Discworld books except for The Wee Free Men and Snuff. He is a seven foot tall skeleton who appears when people die to take their souls to the afterlife. Even though he is seen as frightening, he is sometimes kind to people. He especially likes cats. ===City Watch=== The City Watch is a police force in one of the main cities on the Discworld. At the beginning of the series, there are only a few members of the City Watch and they are lazy and useless. Later in the series, they grow to have many members and stop crimes around the city. ===Witches=== The main witch in the series is Granny Weatherwax. She seems not to like most people but still helps to heal them when they are sick and deliver babies. ==Novels== No. Title Published Subseries Notes 1 The Colour of Magic 1983 Rincewind 93rd in the Big Read. 2 The Light Fantastic 1986 Rincewind Continues from The Colour of Magic 3 Equal Rites 1987 Witches 4 Mort 1987 Death 65th in the Big Read 5 Sourcery 1988 Rincewind 6 Wyrd Sisters 1988 Witches 135th in the Big Read 7 Pyramids 1989 Djelibeybi British Science Fiction Award winner, 1989 8 Guards!
