 "text": "A weather radar is a type of radar used to show where precipitation is. Weather radar data can be analyzed to tell the movement of precipitation, what type it is (rain, snow, hail, etc.), and forecast its future. Modern weather radars are mostly Doppler radars, which can find the direction and speed of rain drops and the intensity of the precipitation. Both types of information can be used to find the structure of storms and tell if they signify any severe weather (tornadoes, flash floods, etc.). ==References== ==Other websites== * Radar tutorial * Weather Underground * Canadian weather radar FAQ Category:Meteorology Category:Radar",
