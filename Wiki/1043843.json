The title of the song is a reference to an internet meme of Danielle Bregoli on Dr. Phil. The song was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song is a freestyle rap over the beat of Missy Elliott's 1999 song \"She's a Bitch\". Elliott said that she was a fan of the song, saying \"Oh he rode the heck out of this Fiyahthis my She's a Bith beat! Me & @Timbaland did this beat in 1999 & it still Bang! big up\". A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Cole Bennett. In the video, Ski is in Times Square carrying around a doll of Chucky from the Child's Play movies. He smokes a joint, drinks lean out of a Sprite bottle, and hangs out with street performers dressed as the Statue of Liberty. He is also seen rapping to himself in a mirror and out of the window in the back of a car. Rolling Stone ranked the video #137 on their list of The 150 Greatest Hip-Hop Videos of All Time. Pitchfork also put the video on their list of their favorite music videos of the 2010s. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2017 songs Category:Ski Mask the Slump God songs Category:Hip hop songs",
