 "text": "Kogen-jinja Shrine was a shrine located in Chuncheon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea The enshrined deities were Amaterasu Omikami, Emperor Meiji, Kunitama Omikami, and Susanoo no Mikoto. Sosawo-son was added to Mt. Gozu in Chuncheon, including Gisangbong Peak, as it was one of the identified places of Soshimori of Silla. It was associated with imperialism and State Shinto rather than local belief in Shintoism. During that time, the government forced people to visit shrines instead of visiting them voluntarily. Because of Japan's loss in World War II, the shrine was abolished on November 17, 1945.内務省告示第264号 官報第5660号（昭和20年11月22日） 1頁 == References == == Sources == * Masaaki Aono, \"'Inland and South Korea' in Colonial Korea and Ebara Shrine\" Included in \"The Historical Phase of Modern Japan \" (edited by Tetsuya Ohama, 1999, ISBN 4-88708-256-8 ) Category:Gion faith Category:Kokuhei Shōsha Category:1918 establishments Category:Shinto shrines in the Japanese colonial empire Category:Shinmei shrines",
