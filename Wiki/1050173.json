 "text": "The FIFA Women's World Cup is a big football (soccer) competition for women's national teams from around the world. It's organized by FIFA, which is in charge of global football. They started it in 1991, and it happens every four years. Teams get in by doing well in their own regions, and the team from the country that's hosting the tournament also gets to play automatically. Just like the men's World Cup, the Women's World Cup ends with a final game. This game is the last one in the knockout stage, and it decides which team is the world champion in women's football. The most recent World Cup was in 2023, and it was hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Spain won that tournament by beating England 1–0, and it was their first time winning. If, after 90 minutes of regular play, the score is tied, they play an extra 30 minutes called \"extra time.\" If the game is still tied after that, they decide the winner by taking penalty kicks. The team that does better in the penalty shoot-out becomes the champion. So, they've always determined the winner with a one-off match in every tournament. == List of finals == Key to the list of finals * Match was won with a golden goal Match was won on a penalty shoot-out after extra time * The \"Year\" column refers to the year the World Cup was held, and wikilinks to the article about that tournament.
