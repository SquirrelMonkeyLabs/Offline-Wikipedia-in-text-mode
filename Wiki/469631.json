He believed that peace and joy is always accessible for all people. One way to discover that joy, is by what they call \"mindful\" meditation. Which is a type of meditation that concentrates on your breathing and embracing everything that comes up on your consciousness, without interpreting it with thought and critisism. But accompanying it with the great power of forgiveness, understanding and realisation of the present moment, which is also a very important point of reference in his teachings. ==Health and death== On 11 November 2014, Nhất Hạnh was hospitalized with a severe brain hemorrhage. Nhất Hạnh died on January 21, 2022 in Huế, Vietnam from problems caused by a stroke at the age of 95.Thich Nhat Hanh, Zen teacher who popularized mindfulness in the West, dies at 95 ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1926 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Vietnamese activists Category:Buddhist clergy Category:People from Huế",
