 "text": "Kugelmugel is an art installation by artist Edwin Lipburger (1928-8 January 2015). It is a round house with a diameter of 8m. Currently it stands on a spot at the Wiener Prater, in Vienna, surrounded by barbed wire. Lipburger declared it to be an autonomous republic. For this reason, some see it as a micronation. Today, it is mostly a tourist attraction in Vienna. Category:Buildings and structures in Vienna Category:Micronations",
