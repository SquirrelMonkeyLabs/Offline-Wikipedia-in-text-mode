 "text": "Racism in the Muslim world is a concern, especially for Black Muslims and other darker colored Muslims. Black Muslims around the world say that face racism from other Muslims who are Arab, White, Asian, or other non-Black ethnicities. In countries where white people are the majority, white Muslims may have more rights compared to their non-white Muslim brothers. In Arab countries, racism against Black Muslims and other non-Arab Muslims are common. Racist beliefs and oppression that happen in the Arab world against Black Muslims is connected to the Trans-Saharan slave trade, the Red Sea slave trade, and the Indian Ocean slave trade. == Issues == In the Western world, both white Muslims and Black Muslims may used in a \"unfair\" way in institutions to show the diversity of the organization. White Muslims may be put on the front stage for advertismements. Black Muslims in France say that they are placed in a \"unfair\" way in non-Black Muslim places that do not care or include the voices of Black Muslims. == References == Category:Racism Category:Islamic culture Category:Articles with excerpts",
