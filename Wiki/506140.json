 "text": "Snapchat is a photo sharing app. Using the app, people can take pictures, add a text or drawing and send them to a list of contacts. The service started in September 2011. At first it was intended to send selfies that would disappear quickly but people learned how to save the pictures. In June 2017 the app added \"Snap Map\". Snap Map is a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map. This caused concerns over privacy and safety. In June 2022, Snapchat introduced Snapchat Plus, a paid subscription offering early access to features, custom app icons, and the ability to see who rewatched stories. In July 2022, Snapchat+ feature, Friend Solar System, get famous for its unique way of ranking best friends in a solar system format. ==References== Category:2011 establishments Category:American social networking websites Category:Photography",
