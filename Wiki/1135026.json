 "text": "International broadcasting consists of radio and television transmissions that purposefully cross international boundaries, often with the intent of allowing expatriates to remain in touch with their countries of origin as well as to educate, inform, and influence residents of foreign countries. Content can range from overt propaganda and counterpropaganda to cultural content and news reports that reflect the point of view and concerns of the originating country or that seek to provide alternative information to that otherwise available, as well as promote tourism and trade. == History == === Origins === The origins of international broadcasting date back to World War I, when German and British stations broadcast press communiqu√©s using Morse code. With the severing of Germany's undersea cables, the wireless telegraph station in Nauen became Germany's sole means of long-distance communication. The US Navy Radio Service station in New Brunswick, Canada, transmitted the 'Fourteen Points' by wireless to Nauen in 1917. In turn, Nauen station broadcast the news of the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II on November 10, 1918. Guglielmo Marconi pioneered the use of shortwave radio for long-distance transmissions in the early 1920s. Using a system of parabolic reflector antennae, Marconi's assistant, Charles Samuel Franklin, rigged up a large antenna at Poldhu Wireless Station, Cornwall, running on 25 kW of power. In June and July 1923, wireless transmissions were completed during nights on 97 meters from Poldhu to Marconi's yacht Elettra in the Cape Verde Islands. === Expansion === The success of early international broadcasts led to the development of dedicated services like the BBC Empire Service (now known as the BBC World Service), inaugurated on December 19, 1932, with transmissions aimed toward Australia and New Zealand. Over time, numerous countries established their own international broadcasting services to disseminate information and promote cultural diplomacy. == See also == * BBC World Service * Voice of America * Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty * Soft power == References == Category:Broadcasting Category:Radio Category:Television",
