 "text": "A physical property is a property, quality or way that an object is. A physical property can always be measured without changing or making the object chemically different or different in a way that would effect its chemical or atomic structure. There are two types of physical properties: intensive and extensive. *Intensive physical properties do not depend on how much of the object there is. For example, a small rock will be just as hard as a large rock. hardness, softness and speed (quickness) are intensive physical properties. *Extensive physical properties change depending on how much of the object there is. For example, a small rock weighs less than a large rock. Volume, total mass, and weight are extensive physical properties. Category:Physics Category:Measurement Category:Physical properties",
