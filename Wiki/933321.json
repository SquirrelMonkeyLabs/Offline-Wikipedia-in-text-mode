 "text": "Cybersquatting is the use of a domain name which is another person's trademark. The domain name may be the name of a person, a company, or an organization. The purpose of cybersquatting is to make money. For example: *Domain parking: somebody buys a domain name of a company, because they hope to sell the domain to the company later. *Phishing: somebody buys the domain name of a company, to fool people who visit that website. These visitors think the company owns the website -- but a scammer actually owns the website. When they use their banking number, the scammer can now steal money from their bank account. In the USA, cybersquatting may be a crime under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. ==Typosquatting== Typosquatting is a kind of cybersquatting. A domain name is used, which is similar to another website or trademark. For example, typosquatting could use wikpedia.org instead of wikipedia.org. It could also use a different URL extension, such as whitehouse.org instead of whitehouse.gov. ==References== Category:Internet security",
