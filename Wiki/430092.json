 "text": "The Callanish stones ( or )Clachan Chalanais or Tursachan Chalanais in Gaelic are near the village of Callanish (Gaelic: Calanais) on the west coast of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides (Western Isles of Scotland). == Construction and description == The site was built between 2900 and 2600 BC, though there were possibly earlier buildings before 3000 BC. A tomb was later built into the site.Armit, Ian 1996. The Archaeology of Skye and the Western Isles. Edinburgh University Press. The 13 primary stones form a circle about 13 m in diameter, with a long approach avenue of stones to the north, and shorter stone rows to the east, south, and west. The overall layout of the monument recalls a distorted Celtic cross. The individual stones vary from around 1 m to 5 m in height, with an average of 4 m, and are of the local Lewisian gneiss. ==Interpretation== The first written reference to the stones was by Lewis native John Morisone, who in c. 1680 wrote that \"great stones standing up in ranks [...] were sett up in place for devotione\". The tallest of the stones marks the entrance to a burial cairn where human remains have been discovered. An excavation campaign in 1980 and 1981 showed that the burial chamber was a late addition to the site, and that it had been modified a number of times. == References == Category:Stone circles Category:Inner and Outer Hebrides Category:3rd millennium BC buildings and structures",
