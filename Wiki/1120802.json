Kimura was also the best man at Lee's wedding, and one of six pallbearers during his funeral, the others including Dan Inosanto, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Peter Chin and Robert Lee, Bruce's brother. ==Early life== Kimura was born in Clallam Bay, Washington, United States, on March 12, 1924. ==Internment== Kimura and his family were interned in a War relocation center (or internment camp) during World War II following the signing of Executive Order 9066, first at Tule Lake and later at Minidoka, due to their Japanese ethnicity. Kimura was actually taken to the camp one day before his high school graduation.Northwest Asian Weekly, June 8: Taky Kimura, 85, graduates from high school, http://www.nwasianweekly.com/2009/07/june-8-taky-kimura-85-graduates-from- high-school/ Emerging from the internment camp after World War II, Kimura found himself to be downtrodden, broken down and lacking motivation. Because he was unable to graduate from high school due to being taken to the internment camp, and because his family had no money to pay for his college education, his family began to operate a supermarket store in Seattle, Washington. ==Bruce Lee and martial arts== Kimura first learned judo from a fellow internee during World War II. In his mid-thirties, during the year 1959, Kimura met a young, rising 18-year-old martial arts genius named Bruce Lee. Even before Lee opened his first Jun Fan Gung Fu institute in 1960, Kimura was a part of his first students in the US, among them Jesse Glover, James DeMile, Ed Hart, Skipp Ellsworth and LeRoy Garcia. Kimura then joined Bruce's early kung-fu club where Lee taught Jun Fan Gung Fu, literally translating to Bruce Lee's Kung Fu and his version of Wing Chun, Kimura became Lee's student, assistant and at that time, his \"best friend.\" Together, they practiced, sparred, trained, and then founded Lee's first kung fu club (the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute) renting a small basement room with a half door entry from 8th Street in Seattle's Chinatown, where he became Lee's first Assistant Instructor.Bruce Lee Biography, Kimura was also the best man to Bruce Lee at Bruce's wedding to Linda Emery.
