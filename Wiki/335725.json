 "text": "The 1994 Northridge Earthquake was a violent natural disaster that took place on Monday, January 17, 1994 at 0430 Pacific Standard Time around the Los Angeles area. The earthquake had a strong moment magnitude at around 6.7, although ground acceleration was one of the highest ever recorded in an urban region of North America. Almost 60 people died and property damage totaled between $20 billion and $23 billion, making this earthquake one of the costliest disasters in the history of the United States. The productions for movies and television programs were shut down, a number of highways and roads were damaged and several Hollywood studios (including Warner Bros., Disney and Universal Pictures) were closed off as a result of this disaster. ==References== Category:1994 in California Category:1990s in Los Angeles, California Category:Earthquakes in the 1990s Category:Earthquakes in California Category:1994 disasters",
