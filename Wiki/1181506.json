 "text": "The vanadyl ion is a polyatomic ion (chemical compound with electrical charge) made of vanadium and oxygen, with the chemical formula . Because of the small size and high charge of the vanadium atom, it is an unusual example of a stable polyatomic cation containing a transition metal. It has a characteristic blue colour, as seen in the mineral cavansite. Vanadyl ions occur in seawater. == References == Category:Cations Category:Oxygen compounds Category:Vanadium compounds",
