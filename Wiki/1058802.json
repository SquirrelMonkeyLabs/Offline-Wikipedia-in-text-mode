 "text": "Conniff's shrub frog or the haycock shrub frog (Pseudophilautus conniffae) is a frog. It lives in southwestern Sri Lanka. People have seen it in rainforests between 80 and 300 meters above sea level. Scientists used to think that Pseudophilautus limbus and Pseudophilautus coniffae were two different frogs. In 2019, they decided they were the same frog. The adult male frog is 22.9 - 25.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 29.3 â€“ 30.7 mm long. The skin of the frog's head comes right out of the bone. The skin of the frog's back is light brown with some dark brown marks. There is black and white color on the legs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
