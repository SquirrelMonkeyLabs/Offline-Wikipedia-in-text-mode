 "text": "A megadrought is an extended drought. It lasts two decades or more. Megadroughts in the past were linked with La Ni√±a conditions lasting for many years. The term megadrought generally refers to the length of a drought, not its intensity. Multiyear droughts lasting one decade or less, like the Dust Bowl drought of the 1930s, are not a megadrought though they lasted a long time. Megadroughts have caused people to move away from the drought-affected areas. One example is Ancestral Puebloans in the Southwestern United States. ==References== Category:Droughts",
