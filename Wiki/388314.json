 "text": "In Roman mythology, the Parcae (singular: Parca) were the female personifications of destiny. They are often called the Fates in English. Their Greek equivalents were the Moirai. They controlled the \"thread of life\" of every mortal and immortal. Even the gods feared the Parcae. The names of the three Parcae were: * Nona (Greek equivalent Clotho), who spun the thread of life on her spindle;John Day, God's Conflict With the Dragon and the Sea: Echoes of a Canaanite Myth in the Old Testament, CUP Archive, 1985, p. 308. * Decima (Greek Lachesis), who measured the thread of life; * Morta (Greek Atropos), who cut the thread of life and chose the way a person would die.L.
