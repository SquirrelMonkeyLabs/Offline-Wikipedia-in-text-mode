It split a British colony called the Province of Quebec into two separate provinces. The province of Upper Canada since renamed Ontario and the province of Lower Canada since renamed Quebec. Each was given elected representatives to let the government know what they wanted but who didn't have any actual power. == References == Category:British Empire Category:18th century in Canada",
