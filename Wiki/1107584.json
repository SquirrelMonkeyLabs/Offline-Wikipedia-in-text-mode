 "text": "The red-headed flying frog or Hainan stream tree frog (Buergeria oxycephala) is a frog. It lives in China on Hainan Island. This frog can be small or medium sized. The adult male frog is 37 - 44 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 49 - 69 mm long. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. There is only a little webbed skin on the front feet but a lot of webbed skin on the back feet. People see this frog on hills on Hainan Island. They see this frog in larger streams, usually in forests. The adults sit on rocks. The female frog lays eggs in still water, and the tadpoles swim in puddles. They see this frog between 80 and 1000 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs in the water. She lays 200â€“600 eggs at a time. The eggs hatch into tadpoles with large disks on their mouths. Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a small place that human beings keep changing in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. For example, people build farms to grow rubber. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
