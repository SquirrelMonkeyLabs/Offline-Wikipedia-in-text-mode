 "text": "Anomaloglossus murisipanensis is a frog. Scientists found it in Venezuela. ==Home== Scientists saw the frog in exactly one place, Murisipan-Tepui, which is a high flatland. They saw it 2300 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside Canaima National Park and Los Tepuyes Natural Monument. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN and from Venezuela all say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Most of these frogs live high on the tepui flatland, but people set fires lower down that can go that high. Climate change can also hurt this frog. There is nowhere higher and colder for them to climb to if the weather becomes too hot. Diseases from viruses, bacteria, and fungi could also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
