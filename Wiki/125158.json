Rosellini was part of the Democratic Party and was the Governor of Washington (1957â€“1965) for two terms. Rosellini died of pneumonia. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living person to have been a governor of a U.S. state, having lived longer than any other State Governor in US history, and was the first Italian American Catholic to become a governor of a state west of the Mississippi River. He was called \"Taxellini\" by people who did not think he was doing a good job as a governor, while he was called \"The Gov.\" by people who did think he was doing a good job. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:2011 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:American centenarians Category:Lawyers from Washington (state) Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Disease-related deaths in Washington (state) Category:Governors of Washington (state) Category:Politicians from Tacoma, Washington",
