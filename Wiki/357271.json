 "text": "Louis Pierre Vieillot (10 May 1748, Yvetot - 1831, Rouen) was a French ornithologist. Vieillot described a large number of birds for the first time. These included birds he saw during the time he spent in the West Indies and North America. 26 genera and 32 species of North American birds were first described by him. Most of the well-known North American birds, such as the Wild Turkey, the Pintail, the Cedar Waxwing, and the Scarlet Tanager, were given their scientific names by him. == References == Category:1748 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Ornithologists Category:French scientists",
