The waters of Ticao Pass are considered a potential Marine Protected Area (MPA) and are often referred to as the \"Ticao-Burias Pass Protected Seascape\", recognized for its rich marine biodiversity, including large species like whale sharks and manta rays, making it a key area for conservation efforts in the Philippines. A global conservation response to overfishing, poaching and destructive blast fishing is underway. ==References== Category:Straits of the Philippines Category:Bicol Region",
