First introduced in Battle Tendency with his friend, Caesar Zeppeli, he appears in the later parts Stardust Crusaders and Diamond is Unbreakable. After Stardust Crusaders, Joseph's grandson, Jotaro Kujo, is the JoJo with the most major appearances in the series. From his birth he can use a special power called the \"Ripple\" (Hamon in the original Japanese), which is based on life energy. In Jojo's Bizarre adventure people also can have special powers that are called a \"Stand\". Joseph has a stand which is called Hermit Purple. It is called that because it represents the 9th tarot card: The Hermit. This stand can take spirit photos, be used as a grappling hook, and conduct the Ripple like an electric current. It appears as a lot of purple vines covered in thorns. Category:JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Category:Manga Category:Anime characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1987",
