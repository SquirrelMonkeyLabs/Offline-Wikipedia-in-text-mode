Other sources of light are called 'lights', such as streetlights, flashlights, and headlights, which in some countries are called streetlamps, torches and headlamps. Before electric lamps were invented, gas lamps, oil lamps or candles were used. ==Related pages== * Compact fluorescent lamp * Gas discharge lamp *Lava lamp (mostly used for decoration rather than lighting a room) == References == Category:Furniture Category:Lamps",
