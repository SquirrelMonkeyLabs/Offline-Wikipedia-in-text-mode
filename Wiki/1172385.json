 "text": "The Battle of Cordoba was a battle between Abd al-Rahman I and Al-Fihri. The battle resulted in victory for Abd al-Rahman and his loyalists who established the Emirate of Cordoba. == Background == Abd al-Raḥman I was a member of the Umayyad dynasty of Syria who founded an Umayyad dynasty in Spain. When the Abbasid Caliphate overthrew the Umayyad Caliphate in 750 CE and sought to kill as many members of the Umayyad family as possible, Abd al-Raḥman would than flee to Spain in hope of establishing another Umayyad state. == Tensions begin == Upon landing in Torrox, Al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman was greeted by clients by the names of Abu Uthman and Ibn Khalid and an escort of 300 cavalry. During this time, emir Al-Fihri pondered what to do about the new threat. He decided to try to marry Abd al-Rahman into their family. If that did not work, then Abd al-Rahman would have to be killed. == Battle == In May 756 Abd al-Raḥman defeated Yusuf's forces outside Cordoba, and Abd al-Raḥman chose that city as the capital of the Spanish Umayyad emirate. His forces took Malaga and Seville, and then marched on the provincial capital of Al-Andalus, Cordoba, in 756 CE. Below the walls of the city, Abd al-Rahman defeated the forces of Al- Fihri. == References == Category:7th-century conflicts Category:Córdoba, Andalusia Category:History of Spain Category:Wars involving Europe",
