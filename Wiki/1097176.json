 "text": "Camel are a brand of cigarettes from the United States, and are owned by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in America and owned by Japan Tobacco everywhere except the United States. The cigarettes mix Turkish tobacco and Virginia tobacco for their flavor. The city where R.J Reynolds was made is called by some \"Camel City\" due to how popular the cigarette is. == Ad campaigns and controversies == In the 1930s, R. J. Reynolds ran an ad campaign claiming Camels aided in digestion. From 1946 to 1952, R. J. Reynolds ran a series of print, radio, and TV ads showing doctors approving of Camel cigarettes. This included making claims that Camels never caused throat irritation. They used the slogan \"More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette\" to mislead people to believe smoking was safe. R. J. Reynolds manipulated these statistics by giving out free cartons of Camels to doctors and then asking what brand they smoked. In 1974, R.J. Reynolds created \"Joe Camel\", a cartoon mascot that was accused of marketing cigarettes to children. Joe Camel was depicted as a human-like creature with a camel's head. The campaign started in Europe and was expanded to the U.S. in 1988. After several lawsuits and a Federal Trade Commission complaint, R. J. Reynolds discontinued the Joe Camel ads in 1997. Other less-controversial campaigns include \"Have a real cigarette - have a Camel\" and \"I'd walk a mile for a Camel\". == References == Category:Cigarette brands",
