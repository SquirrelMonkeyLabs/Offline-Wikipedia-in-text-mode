 "text": "Vengeance (2001) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) show made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on December 9, 2001 at the San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego, California. It was the first Vengeance event held by the WWF. The show replaced Armageddon in the December PPV slot because of the possible insensitivity of the latter's name with respect to the September 11 attacks. The following year Armageddon returned, and Vengeance moved to the July PPV slot. In the main event, World Champion Chris Jericho defeated WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin in the finals of a three-match torunament to become the first Undisputed WWF Champion. Jericho won the World Championship minutes earlier from The Rock. ==Results== ==References== ==Other websites== * Vengeance 2001 official results Category:2001 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in San Diego Category:WWE Vengeance Category:2001 in California Category:21st century in San Diego",
