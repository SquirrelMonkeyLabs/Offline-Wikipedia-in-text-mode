 "text": "Bhoota is a supernatural being. In Indian subcontinental culture and folktales, a bhoota is any ghostly being that often manifests from someone who has died. People of the subcontinent still believe in ghosts because of having many places said to be haunted, like old buildings, forts, and cremation grounds. In Bengali culture, ghosts are important both for Muslims and Hindus. In Pakistan, the term jinn is used for both bhootas and spirits from Arabic and Persian stories. These bhootas can either be ghosts of dead people or jinns from another world. == Characteristics of Bhootas == Bhutas are spirits that can change into various animals but generally take human forms. Their feet face backward. They float above the ground because they avoid touching the ground-as the earth is sacred in many Indian traditions. Bhutas do not have a shadow and speak with a nasal voice. They are often seen in white clothes and sometimes live in trees or haunt places where they were killed. A special type of bhoota is called a churel, which is the spirit of a woman who died during pregnancy or childbirth. Churels take the form of women but have feet pointed backward, toes reversed, or some other strange features. They try to attract young men at road crossings or fields and if a man falls for a churel, she may cause his death. == References == Category:Nepali culture Category:Superstitions Category:Indian culture",
