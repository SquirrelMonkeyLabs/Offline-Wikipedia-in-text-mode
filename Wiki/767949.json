 "text": "The M49 is a short motorway near Bristol, England. It links the M5 south of Bristol with the M4 at the Second Severn Crossing bridge. It is mainly used by traffic on the M5 travelling north who want to use the bridge into Wales. You can only get to the motorway from other motorways. There is one junction that has been built, but there are no links to nearby roads and therefore the junction is not open to the public.CBRD Motorway Database â€“ M49 ==Junctions== {| style=\"margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em; color:black; font-size:95%;\" class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#0080d0; text-align:center; color:white; font-size:120%;\" | colspan=\"5\" | M49 motorway junctions |- !scope=col|miles !scope=col|km !scope=col abbr=\"North-west bound\"|North-west bound exits (B carriageway) !scope=col|Junction !scope=col abbr=\"South-east bound\"|South-east bound exits (A carriageway) |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 0.0 | rowspan=\"2\"| 0.0 | Bristol, London M4(E) | rowspan=\"2\"| M4 J22 terminus | The South West, Avonmouth M49 |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | South Wales, Cardiff, Newport M4(W) | Start of motorway |- align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"2\"|5.3 |rowspan=\"2\"|8.5 | Start of motorway | rowspan=\"2\"| Terminus A4, M5 J18 & J18A | Avonmouth, Bristol, Airport A4 |- align=\"center\" | South Wales, Cardiff, Newport (M4(W)) M49 | The South West, Weston-s-Mare, M5 |- align=\"center\" |- |colspan=5|Notes *Distances in kilometres and carriageway identifiers are obtained from driver location signs/location marker posts.
