It displays the bravery of a person who embraces the bull. The person who wins the event was awarded with money in the ancient Tamil period The earliest history of Jallikattu was from about 2500 years ago. It is held on the day of third day of Pongal festival and second day of Thai month of the Tamil calendar which is known as Maatu Pongal. The Supreme Court ordered a ban on this event on 7th of May,2014 because of animal welfare issues.And the Tamil Nadu youngsters protested against the Supreme Court's decision at the Marina beach .Despite being banned more than 2 million people participate in this annual event. The ongoing protests forced the government of India to issue a special ordinance for jallikattu and hence the ban was lifted by the Union Government on 8th of Januar,2018. Organisations like PETA protested against this order and the people of Tamil Nadu asked for the banishment of this organisation from the state.
