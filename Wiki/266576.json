 "text": "A braided river is a network of small channels separated by islands that are often not fixed. In other words, the river channels wander across a flat area. Braided rivers are found in places where the river carries a lot of sediment, and when it slows down and spreads out. The river delta of the Amazon River is a good example on a huge scale, and the Waimakariri River is a good example on a smaller scale. == Large systems == Large braided river systems are found around the world: * Alaska * Canada * New Zealand's South Island * the Himalayas All these regions contain young mountains that erode quickly. Europe has three notably braided rivers: the Narew, in Poland and Belarus, the Tagliamento in northeastern Italy and the Vjosa River in Albania and Greece. == Related pages == *Meander ==Other websites== * Category:Rivers",
