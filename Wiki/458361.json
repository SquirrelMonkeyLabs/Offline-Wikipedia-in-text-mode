 "text": "Saint Eric's Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Stockholm, Sweden. It is located on SÃ¶dermalm, the southern part of central Stockholm. It was built in 1892, and in 1953 it was raised to the status of a cathedral, when the Roman Catholic Diocese of Stockholm was created. An extension, designed by architects Hans Westman and Ylva Lenormand, was inaugurated in 1983, during the 200th anniversary of the 1783 re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church in Sweden. The church takes it name from Saint Eric. Image:Stockholms katolska domkyrka interior.JPG|Interior of the Cathedral. Image:Catholic Cathedral of Stockholm.svg|Flag of Saint Eric's Cathedral.
