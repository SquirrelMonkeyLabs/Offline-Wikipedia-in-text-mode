 "text": "Chill-out music began in Europe during the early-1990s. It includes different types of electronic music that are meant to have a mellow style as well as mid-tempo beats. Ambient, ambient house, trip-hop, nu jazz, Chillow pop, New Age and some other sub-genres of downtempo are mainly associated with chill- out music. This genre of music is played in \"chill rooms\" at dance clubs to allow dancers a chance to relax and take a break from the more vigorous and fast-tempo type of music that is played on the main dance floor. In 1992, a UK regulation required dance clubs to have chill-out rooms and free water because of a number of Ecstasy-related injuries and deaths. ==References== Category:Music genres",
