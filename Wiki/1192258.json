Scientists saw this frog between 50 and 1100 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog inside some protected parks: National Park Tolhuaca, Parque Nacional Alerce Costero, Parque Nacional Puyehue, Monumento Natural Contulmo, and Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs in small puddles in theg round. The tadpoles do not eat. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to get firewood and make pine and Eucalyptus tree farms. Forest fires and too many visitors are also problems. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
