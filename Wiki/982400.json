After Marley died his ghost haunted Scrooge and explained that since he never helped anyone when he was alive he had to fix that by helping people from the afterlife so he wouldn’t be chained up in contracts and ledgers for eternity. Marley’s ghost tries to scare Scrooge into becoming a better person so that Scrooge won’t have to suffer in the afterlife. When that doesn’t work, Marley decides to have three spirits come to Scrooge for him, the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.
