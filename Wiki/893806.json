 "text": "Daphne Njie Efundem (born 20 September 1989) known professionally as Daphne is a Cameroonian singer. She's also best known for her own song \"Rastafari\". == Biography == Daphne was born in Buea to a Bakweri father and a Banyangi mother. She grew up in Douala, Cameroon. She has lived in Yaoundé, Buea in the Southwest Region, and even abroad. She has always been a big fan of CeCe Winans, Mary Mary, Bébé Manga and Frank Edwards. Her modern music tastes include Tiwa Savage and Rihanna, but she says they have not influenced her own work. Technically speaking, the most important thing for her when writing a song is to find the right melody because \"melodies carry emotions\". Daphne's captivating voice is often compared to a fairy. She admits that she \"would like to touch the hearts of people who have stopped believing in their dreams, in their lives; who only think of running away. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:Cameroonian musicians category:Singers",
