 "text": "His Grace or Her Grace is a style of address used for various high-ranking persons. It was the style used to address the King or Queen of Scots up to the Act of Union of 1707. It was also used to address monarchs of England before Henry VIII. Today, the style is used when referring to dukes and duchesses in the United Kingdom, who are not members of the royal family. Your Grace would be used in spoken or written address. Royal dukes, for example The Duke of York, are addressed with their higher royal title, Royal Highness.Debrett's Illustrated peerage, and titles of courtesy, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (London: Dean & Son, 1865), p. x ==Examples== * His Grace The Duke of Ormonde. *His Grace The Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne *His Grace The Duke of Marlborough.
