 "text": "S-comma (majuscule: Ș, minuscule: ș) is a letter which is part of the Romanian alphabet, used to represent the sound , the voiceless postalveolar fricative (like sh in shoe). == History == The letter was proposed in the Buda Lexicon, a book published in 1825, which included two texts by Petru Maior, Orthographia romana sive latino-valachica una cum clavi and Dialogu pentru inceputul linbei române, introducing ș for and ț for .Marinella Lörinczi Angioni, \"Coscienza nazionale romanza e ortografia: il romeno tra alfabeto cirillico e alfabeto latino \", La Ricerca Folklorica, No. 5, La scrittura: funzioni e ideologie. (Apr., 1982), pp. 75–85. ==Unicode support== S-comma was not initially supported in early Unicode versions, nor in the predecessors like ISO/IEC 8859-2 and Windows-1250. Instead, Ş (S-cedilla), a character available since Unicode 1.1.0 (1993), was used for digital texts written in Romanian. In some contexts, like with low-resolution screens and printouts, the visual distinction between ș and ş is minimal. In 1999, at the request of the Romanian Standardization Association, S-comma was introduced in Unicode 3.0. Nevertheless, encoding for the S-comma was not supported in retail versions of Microsoft Windows XP, but a later European Union Expansion Font Update provided the feature. While digital accessibility to S-comma has since improved, both characters continue to be used interchangeably in various contexts like publishing. The letter is part of Unicode's Latin Extended-B range, under \"Additions for Romanian\", titled as \"Latin capital letter S with comma below\" (U+0218) and \"Latin small letter s with comma below\" (U+0219).Unicode code charts. Latin Extended-B: Range 0180–024F In HTML, these can be encoded by `&#x0218;` and `&#x0219;`, respectively. ==Use of the comma with the letter S== *Romanian **The Romanian letter (S with comma) represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative (as in \"_sh_ ow\"). On outdated systems which do not support the glyph, the symbol (S with cedilla) is used. Example word: . == Character encoding == ==References== Category:Latin letters with diacritics",
