 "text": "Panorama is the third studio album by American new wave band The Cars, released in 1980. ==Background== The record marked a departure from the upbeat pop rock and hard rock of the group's previous albums, embodying a more aggressive and experimental sound. It was not as commercially successful as The Cars' previous or subsequent albums (until 1987's Door to Door). However, it peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 200 chart and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. As a single from the album, the song \"Touch and Go\" peaked at number 37 on the Billboard 200. ==Track listing== == References == Category:The Cars albums Category:1980 albums",
