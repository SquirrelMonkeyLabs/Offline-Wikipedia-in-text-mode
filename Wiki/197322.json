 "text": "George Brinton McClellan (December 3, 1826 â€“ October 29, 1885) was a Major general in Union army during the American Civil War. In 1861 and 1862, he was in charge of the Army of the Potomac. He led the Peninsula Campaign, an attempt to take Richmond, Virginia that didn't work. Though he won the Battle of Antietam, he did not get along with President Abraham Lincoln, who fired him. After he stopped being a general, he became a politician, and ran against Lincoln in the 1864 election. He was later Governor of New Jersey, though he was originally from Pennsylvania. He was also a prominent engineer, and was offered the job as President of the University of California. He was seen as slow and thought all his fights through, training his soldiers very long. He was too slow acting for Abraham Lincoln's taste, who fired him several times. Mrs. Lincoln despised him greatly, therefore an influence of Mr. Lincoln's decision. == References == Category:1826 births Category:1885 deaths Category:American Civil War generals Category:Politicians from Pennsylvania Category:Governors of New Jersey Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Military people from Pennsylvania",
