McClain wore #37 as a rookie in 2007. He mostly blocked that year, but caught a receiving touchdown in a loss to the San Diego Chargers, who were actually McClain's future team. In 2008, McClain was part of a \"3-Headed Monster\" that also included Ray Rice and Willis McGahee. McClain's role was larger that year. His best moment was probably when he ran for an 82-yard touchdown to seal a win against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 16, in the last game ever at Texas Stadium. McClain finished the year with 232 attempts, 902 rushing yards, and 11 total touchdowns as he was used more as a runningback. McClain was used more as a fullback again during his last two seasons in Baltimore. McClain made it clear he wanted more carries, even selling t-shirts to campaign. ===Kansas City Chiefs=== McClain signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. With the Chiefs, McClain hoped to become a featured ball carrier. However, he had only 15 rushing attempts for 51 yards and two total touchdowns. ===San Diego Chargers=== McClain signed with the San Diego Chargers for the 2012 NFL season. ==References== ==Other websites== *Le'Ron McClain at baltimoreravens.com Category:1984 births Category:Baltimore Ravens players Category:American football fullbacks Category:American football running backs Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:Living people Category:People from Tuscaloosa, Alabama Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Sportspeople from Alabama",
