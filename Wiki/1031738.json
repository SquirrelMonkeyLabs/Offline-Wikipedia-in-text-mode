 "text": "Our Future Health is a health research project in the United Kingdom run by iPLATO. It uses the the NHS App. It aims to recruit 10% of the people, about 5 million, to be a fair sample, with people from all sorts of socioeconomic and ethnic groups. The project is to last 10 or 20 years. People who volunteer must visit a clinic where they are given tests. They give blood samples, and their weight, blood pressure and cholesterol are measured, and their DNA is analysed. The plan is to learn how to find medical problems earlier, before people have symptoms. People who join will be told about their risks of various diseases â€“ first about diabetes and heart disease. The plan is to detect who is at risk of developing all types of diabetes, and why. ==References== Category:Health in the United Kingdom Category:Research organisations in the United Kingdom",
