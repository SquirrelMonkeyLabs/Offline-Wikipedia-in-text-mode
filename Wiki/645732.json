There are three crankshafts which are geared together at one end of the engine. These engines usually had nine cylinders (three banks of three) or eighteen cylinders (six banks of three). These engines were built by D. Napier & Son. ==Key to animation== * Green = incoming air * Orange = burning fuel/air mixture * Purple = outgoing exhaust gas ==References== Category:Motors",
