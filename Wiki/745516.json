 "text": "Ivan Janša (born 17 September 1958), better known as Janez Janša, is a Slovenian politician. He served as prime minister from 2004 to 2008, 2012 to 2013 and from 2020 to 2022. He has been the leader of the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) since 1993. He was also Minister of Defence (1990–1994, 2000). He was born in Grosuplje. His political views are seen as right-wing populism. His style of politics has been compared to former U.S. President Donald Trump. After the 2020 United States presidential election, Janša declared Trump the winner, and supported conspiracy theories about the election. Janša is a close ally of Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán. Janša lost his fourth bid for prime minister in April 2022 to the Freedom Movement party led by Robert Golob. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of Slovenia",
