 "text": "From September 4-16, a series of bombings occurred in multiple apartment blocks resulting in the deaths of more than 300 and injuring an additional 1700 more. == Perpetrators == Russian officials initially claimed that the perpetrators were Russian and foreign Islamic fighters presumably fighting for the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. But the authenticity of these claims has been disputed since none of the perpetrators seemed to be Chechen themselves, and the event caused Putin to rise to presidency. == Second Chechen War == The bombings was one of the main reasons for the start of the Second Chechen War. Putin aimed to justify the war by using the bombing and other events like the Dagestan War, comparing the campaign to U.S. anti-terrorist actions and and emphasizing its precision in targeting terrorist bases to avoid civilian casualties. == References == Category:1990s in Russia Category:1990s building bombings Category:1999 disasters",
