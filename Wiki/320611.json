 "text": "Scat singing is used in jazz music. It is performed by using the voice to make sounds, but not using any recognisable words. A singer would improvise (make up) a solo using nonsense syllables, which is like a musical instrument solo in a song. Scat singing probably started when singers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald began to use their voices to copy the sounds of instruments. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Jazz music Category:Singing",
