 "text": "Haloperidol (also marketed as Haldol) is an antipsychotic medication. It is most commonly used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar mania, acute psychosis, and tics in Tourette syndrome. Haloperidol works by blocking the effects of dopamine in certain parts of the brain. Some of the possible side effects of haloperidol include drowsiness, constipation, weight gain and dry mouth. In rare cases, Haloperidol can cause movement disorders, such as shuffling gait or tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the face). == References == Category:Drugs used in psychiatry Category:Organonitrogen compounds Category:Organochlorides Category:Organofluorides",
