It was made by a British silversmith in 1878. == History == The trophy was first awarded in 1968 to the regular-season champions of the West Division. Starting in 1975, the trophy was awarded to the regular-season winner of the Campbell Conference. Starting in 1982, the trophy was awarded to the playoff champion in the Campbell Conference. Since 1994, the trophy has been awarded to the playoff champion in the Western Conference. A traditional supersitition that is prevalent among many of today's NHL players is that no player should either touch or lift the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. == Winners == Total awards won Wins Team 8 Edmonton Oilers 7 Chicago Blackhawks 6 Detroit Red Wings 6 Philadelphia Flyers 3 Calgary Flames 3 Minnesota/Dallas Stars 3 Los Angeles Kings 3 New York Islanders 3 Vancouver Canucks 2 Anaheim (Mighty) Ducks 2 Colorado Avalanche 2 St. Louis Blues ;Key *^ = Year clinched to lead years won *¤ = Year clinched to consecutively lead years won *† = Eventual Stanley Cup champions ===West Division regular season champions (1967–74)=== Season Winner Win # Philadelphia Flyers 1 St. Louis Blues 1 St. Louis Blues 2 Chicago Black Hawks 1 Chicago Black Hawks 2 Chicago Black Hawks 3 Philadelphia Flyers † 2 ===Campbell Conference regular season champions (1974–81)=== Season Winner Win # Philadelphia Flyers † 3 Philadelphia Flyers 4 Philadelphia Flyers ¤ 5 New York Islanders 1 New York Islanders 2 Philadelphia Flyers 6 New York Islanders † 3 ===Campbell Conference playoffs champions (1981–93)=== Season Winner Win # Vancouver Canucks 1 Edmonton Oilers 1 Edmonton Oilers † 2 Edmonton Oilers † 3 Calgary Flames 1 Edmonton Oilers † 4 Edmonton Oilers † 5 Calgary Flames † 2 Edmonton Oilers † 6 Minnesota North Stars 1 Chicago Blackhawks 4 Los Angeles Kings 1 ===Western Conference playoffs champions (1993–present)=== Season Winner Win # Vancouver Canucks 2 Detroit Red Wings 1 Colorado Avalanche † 1 Detroit Red Wings † 2 Detroit Red Wings † 3 Dallas Stars † 1 Dallas Stars 2 Colorado Avalanche † 2 Detroit Red Wings † 4 1 Calgary Flames 3 \\- Edmonton Oilers ^ 7 Anaheim Ducks † 2 Detroit Red Wings † 5 Detroit Red Wings 6 Chicago Blackhawks † 5 Vancouver Canucks 3 Los Angeles Kings † 2 Chicago Blackhawks † 6 Los Angeles Kings † 3 Chicago Blackhawks † 7 San Jose Sharks 1 Nashville Predators 1 Vegas Golden Knights 1 St. Louis Blues † 3 Dallas Stars 4 ===Stanley Cup semifinals (2020–2021)=== Season Winner Win # Montreal Canadiens 1 ===Western Conference playoffs champions (2021–present)=== Season Winner Win # Colorado Avalanche † 3 Vegas Golden Knights † 2 Edmonton Oilers 8 == References == Category:National Hockey League trophies and awards",
