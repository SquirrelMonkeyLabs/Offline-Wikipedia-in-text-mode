It is the most powerful weapon in the games. The BFG 9000 can destroy almost any player or enemy in one hit. Quake II and Quake III Arena pay homage to the BFG 9000 with weapons called the BFG10K. The Quake III Arena version works differently than the BFG 9000. It shoots many small plasma beams very quickly instead of one large ball. This means the BFG 9000 causes much more damage in a single hit than the Arena BFG10K. ==Names== The abbreviation \"BFG\" stands for \"Big Fucking Gun\".
