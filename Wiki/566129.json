Historia szlachecka z roku 1811 i 1812 we dwunastu księgach wierszem) is a long poem by Polish romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz.Adam Mickiewicz, Polish poet at Encyclopaedia Britannica. It is regarded as a national epic. It was first published in Paris in 1834. The poet was then in exile in France. Sir Thaddeus is a story of a conflict between two noble families, the Soplicas and the Horeszkos. The time is 1811 and 1812, shortly before Napoleon invaded Russia. When attacked by Russian soldiers, both families fought against the enemy. The conflict between the families was ended with the marriage of Thaddeus Soplica and Sophia Horeszko. Adam Mickiewicz was born in the East of the former Polish-Lithuanian state. Because of that he called Lithuania his mother-country. Litwo! Ojczyzno moja! ty jesteś jak zdrowie. Ile cię trzeba cenić, ten tylko się dowie, Kto cię stracił. Dziś piękność twą w całej ozdobie Widzę i opisuję, bo tęsknię po tobie. Lithuania, my country, thou art like health; how much thou shouldst be prized only he can learn who has lost thee. To-day thy beauty in all its splendour I see and describe, for I yearn for thee. (Translation in prose by George Rapall Noyes). The poem is written in 13-syllable metre, very common in Polish literature. == References == == Bibliography == * Adam Mickiewicz, Pan Tadeusz; or The last foray in Lithuania; a story of life among Polish gentlefolk in the years 1811 and 1812, Translated from the Polish by George Rapall Noyes, London 1917. == Other websites == * Full text of the poem in Polish Category:Epic poems Category:1830s poems Category:Polish literature",
