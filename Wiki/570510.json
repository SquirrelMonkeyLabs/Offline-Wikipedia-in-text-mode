 "text": "Jacques Goÿon, Count of Matignon (Jacques François Léonor; 21 November 1689 – 23 April 1751) was Count of Thorigny and Matignon. He was also the Prince of Monaco as Jacques I after his marriage to Princess Louis Hippolyte of Monaco. He also built the Hôtel Matignon. ==Life== Jacques was born in Normandy. His father was the Count of Matignon. Jacques became the Count of Matignon in 1675 when his father died. Jacques married Princess Louise Hippolyte Grimaldi of Monaco. ==Issue== The children of the couple were technically given the surname of \"Goyon\" after their father however they were sometimes also known under the surname of Grimaldi too. #Antoine Charles Marie Grimaldi (16 December 1717 – 4 February 1718), Marquis of Baux and Count of Matignon. #Charlotte Thérèse Nathalie Grimaldi (19 March 1719 – 1790), nun at the Convent of Visitation at Paris. #Honoré Grimaldi (10 November 1720 – 21 March 1795), successor of his parents. #Charles Marie Auguste Grimaldi (1 January 1722 – 24 August 1749), \"Count of Carladés\" and of Matignon. #Jacques Grimaldi (9 June 1723 – June 1723) died young. #Louise Françoise Grimaldi (15 July 1724 – 15 September 1729), Mademoiselle des Baux. #François Charles Grimaldi (4 February 1726 – 9 December 1743), \"Count of Thorigny\". #Charles Maurice Grimaldi (14 May 1727 – 18 January 1798), \"Count of Valentinois\"; married on 10 November 1749 to Marie Christine de Rouvroy; no children. #Marie Françoise Thérése Grimaldi (20 July 1728 – 20 June 1743), Mademoiselle d'Estouteville died of smallpox unmarried. ==Name and title== Jacques was baptised with the names Jacques François Léonor. Using the name Jacques, his surname was Goyon. His title was \"Comte de Matignon\". This is French for \"Count of Matignon\". Therefore the mixture of Goyon and Matignon is unnecessary, and incorrect. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:House of Grimaldi Category:1689 births Category:1751 deaths Category:Dukes and duchesses of France Category:Princes and princesses of Monaco",
