How to talk to your kids about sexuality Cook Communications Ministries Colorado Springs, CO, page 56 In the first part of his career he was an entomologist specializing in gall wasps of the family Cynipidae. Later, he became famous for the research he did on human sexuality.Gathorne-Hardy, Jonothan 1998. Sex the measure of all things. London: Chatto & Windus. His research had a great influence on social and cultural values in many parts of the world. It also had an influence on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Kinsey and his co-workers wrote two books which became known as the Kinsey Reports. They were based on thousands of interviews with men (first report),Kinsey, Alfred et al 1948. Sexual behavior in the human male. Saunders. and then women.Kinsey, Alfred et al 1953. Sexual behavior in the human female. Saunders. The aim was to find out how widespread or differentiated human sexual practices were. He developed the Kinsey Scale to measure sexual orientation. On one end of the scale, at the value 0, the individual is entirely heterosexual. On the other end, at value 6, he or she has a purely homosexual orientation. Kinsey was bisexual. Kinsey died of heart disease and pneumonia in Bloomington, Indiana. A biopic of him, Kinsey, was released in 2004. *Research into sexual behaviour was also conducted by the Masters and Johnson research team: William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson. == Early work == Kinsey wrote his doctoral thesis on gall wasps. In 1919, Kinsey was awarded a ScD degree by Harvard University, and he accepted an academic post in biology at Indiana University. In 1920 he published several papers in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The papers introduced the gall wasp to the scientific community and described its phylogeny. Of the more than 18 million insects in the museum's collection, some 5 million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey. == Biographies of Kinsey == * Christenson, Cornelia (1971). Kinsey: A Biography.
