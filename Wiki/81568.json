 "text": "Themisto or , is a small prograde non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found in 1975, lost, and then refound in 2000. == Discovery and naming == Themisto was first found by Charles T. Kowal and Elizabeth Roemer on September 30, 1975, reported on October 3, 1975IAUC 2845: Probable New Satellite of Jupiter 1975 October 3 (discovery) and designated . However, not enough observations were made to establish an orbit and it was subsequently lost. Themisto appeared as a footnote in astronomy textbooks into the 1980s. Then, in 2000, a seemingly new moon was found by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Yanga R. Fernández and Eugene A. Magnier, and was designated . It was soon confirmed that this was the same as the 1975 object. The Sheppard et al. announcementIAUC 7525: S/1975 J 1 = S/2000 J 1 2000 November 25 (recovery) was immediately correlated with an August 6 2000 observation by the team of Brett J. Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, Hans Scholl, Matthew J. Holman, Brian G. Marsden, Philip D. Nicholson and Joseph A. Burns — an observation that was reported to the Minor Planet Center but not published as an IAU Circular (IAUC).MPEC 2000-Y16: S/1975 J 1 = S/2000 J 1, S/1999 J 1 2000 December 19 (recovery and ephemeris) In October 2002 it was officially named after Themisto,IAUC 7998: Satellites of Jupiter 2002 October 22 (naming the moon) daughter of the river god Inachus by Zeus (Jupiter) in Greek mythology. == Characteristics == Themisto's orbit is unusual. Unlike most of Jupiter's moons, which orbit in groups, Themisto orbits alone, midway between the Galilean moons and the first group of prograde irregulars. Themisto is about 8 kilometers in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04) == References == # * Ephemeris IAU-MPC NSES # Mean orbital parameters NASA JPL == Other websites == * David Jewitt's pages * Scott Sheppard's pages Category:Jupiter's moons",
