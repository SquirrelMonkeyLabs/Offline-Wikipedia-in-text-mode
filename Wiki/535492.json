 "text": "This article will show the current results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The Democratic Party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates, or people that represent someone, to go to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. People in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency, and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive. The primaries began on 1 February 2016 in Iowa. The remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders. On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press reported that senator Hillary Clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, their count includes some superdelegates. Since superdelegates can vote however they want at the Democratic convention, their votes could change at any time before then, so it is possible (but only remotely possible) that Clinton will not get the nomination. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton on 12 July 2016. == Main candidates == * Hillary Clinton – 67th United States Secretary of State (2009 to 2013), First Lady of the United States (1993 to 2001) and New York senator (2001 to 2009). * Bernie Sanders – Vermont senator (2007 to present) and representative (1991 to 2007). === Dropped out during primaries === * Martin O'Malley – Maryland governor (2007 to 2015) and Baltimore mayor (1999 to 2007). === Dropped out before primaries === * Jim Webb – Virginia senator (2007 to 2013) and Secretary of the Navy (1987 to 1988). * Lincoln Chafee – Rhode Island governor (2011 to 2015), senator (1999 to 2007) and Warwick mayor (1993 to 1999) * Lawrence Lessig – professor == Results == All delegate total are approximate.
