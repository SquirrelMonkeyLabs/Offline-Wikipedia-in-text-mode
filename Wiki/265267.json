The former, exempli gratia, means \"for example\" and is used before giving examples of something (\"I have lots of favorite colors, e.g., blue, green and pink\"). The latter, id est, means \"that is\", and is used before clarifying the meaning of something, when elaborating, specifying, or explaining rather than when giving examples (\"I have lots of favorite colors; i.e., I can't decide on just one\"). In British style, the stops may be omitted: \"I have lots of favourite colours, e.g. blue, green and pink\". \"I have lots of favourite colours; ie I can't decide on just one\". Exempli gratia, 'for example', is commonly abbreviated 'e.g.'; in this usage it is sometimes followed by a comma, depending on style.American style guides tend to recommend that \"e.g.\" and \"i.e.\" should generally be followed by a comma, just as \"for example\" and \"that is\" would be; UK style tends to omit the comma.
