 "text": "The flag of Norway is deep red with a dark blue cross outlined in white. The red, white and blue colors are inspired by the flags of France, United Kingdom and the United States. The colors represent liberty and independence. The flag was created in 1821 by Fredrik Meltzer, who was a member of Norway's parliament, but it wasn't flown until 1899, when Norway and Sweden ended their union. ==References== Norway Category:National symbols of Norway",
