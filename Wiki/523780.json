 "text": "Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the atmosphere. One method of sequestration is by capturing CO2 produced by power plants and factories before they release it into the atmosphere. When the CO2 gas is in long-term storage, that means it has been sequestered. Carbon sequestration aims to assist in elimination of human introduced carbon from Earth's atmosphere by disrupting the carbon cycle. It is also used to prevent future human caused climate change. == Methods == There are two long- term ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere: # Terrestrial Sequestration- plants and trees store CO2 in their bodies and in their roots. # geologic sequestration- bury the CO2 thousands of feet underground. == References == Category:Environmental issues Category:Atmosphere",
