He slipped from the roof and fell through the home's greenhouse. He was dead on arrival at a hospital in Hastings. He was 63. His death was ruled an accident. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1935 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Accidental deaths in the United Kingdom Category:Comedians from Kent Category:Puppeteers",
