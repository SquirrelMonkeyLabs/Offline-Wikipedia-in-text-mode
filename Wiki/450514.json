 "text": "The term vintage clothing means clothing from a previous time. \"Vintage\" is clothing, that are not newly produced, particularly when they exemplify a specific style from the past. Crucially, vintage items serve as a time capsule, embodying the essence of the era in which they were made. They possess the characteristics of their time, such as the distinctive silhouette of a particular decade, prompting immediate recognition like, \"This A-line dress is unmistakably from the 1950s!\" Typically, any garment representing a bygone era or societal trend and aged between 40 to 100 years falls under the category of vintage. == References == Category:Clothing",
