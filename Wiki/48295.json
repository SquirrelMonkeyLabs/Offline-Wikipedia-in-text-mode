 "text": "Northamptonshire (abbreviated Northants or N'hants) is a county in central England with a population of 629,676 (2001 census). It has borders with Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Cambridgeshire, Peterborough, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire (including the Borough of Milton Keynes), Oxfordshire, and Lincolnshire (England's shortest county boundary: 19 metres). The county town is Northampton. Northamptonshire has often been called the county of \"squires and spires\" due to its wide variety of historic buildings and country houses. Northampton is by far the largest town in the county, with a population of 194,122. This is followed by Corby (53,174), Wellingborough (48,428), Kettering (47,000), Rushden (25,849) and Daventry (22,367). Most of the county's population is concentrated in a central north-south. Cherwell Edge in Northamptonshire () is near the River Cherwell, north-west of Banbury, England. The once heavily wooded hill and valley was mostly cleared many years ago. The area now also covers the nearby Cherwell Edge Golf Club that was recently built by it too. The golf club is used by various local residents. == Places == These are the main settlements in Northamptonshire with a town charter, a population over 5,000, or otherwise notable. * Brackley * Braunston * Brixworth * Corby * Daventry * Kettering * Long Buckby * Naseby * Northampton * Oundle * Pitsford * Raunds * Rothwell * Rushden * Silverstone * Towcester * Thrapston * Weedon Bec * Wellingborough Two major canals - the Oxford and the Grand Union â€” join in the county at Braunston.
