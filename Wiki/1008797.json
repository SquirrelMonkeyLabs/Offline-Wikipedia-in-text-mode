 "text": "The Bionic Tower was a visionary vertical city, a very large building designed for human home by Spanish architects Eloy Celaya, María Rosa Cervera and Javier Gómez. It would have a main tower high, with 300 stories housing about 100,000 people. The point of the Bionic Tower is to use bionics to solve the world's rising population problems in an eco-friendly way, a very incredibly hard feat to complete. The Bionic Tower would be exactly 400 meters taller than the now tallest building, Burj Khalifa. == Complexes == The Bionic Tower is composed of two complexes put together. The first complex, Bionic Tower, is made up of twelve vertical neighborhoods, each eighty meters high. The neighborhoods are separated by safety areas to make for easier construction and evacuation in case of an emergency. Each neighborhood has two groups of buildings, one on the interior of the building and one on the exterior. Both groups of buildings are located around large gardens and pools. The second complex, also called the Base Island, is 1,000 meters in diameter, and is made up of many buildings, gardens, pools, and communication equipment. Predicted uses of these complexes include hotels, offices, residential, commerce, cultural, sports and relaxation. == Bionic Vertical Space == In 1997, work on the early model Bionic Vertical Space started. This was created by the architects Eloy Celaya, María Rosa Cervera and Javier Gómez through the beginning of 2001. However, Eloy Celaya, who studied at Columbia University, is creating an another project almost the same to the Bionic Tower project. While in office, then-Shanghai mayor Xu Kuangdi expressed an interest in the idea for his city. Hong Kong also reportedly expressed interest in the project. == References == Category:Arcology",
