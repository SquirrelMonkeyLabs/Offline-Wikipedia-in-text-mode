 "text": "Youth in Action is a European program that lasted from 2007 until 2013 labeled for young people in order to help make a shared European mindset where young people from different countries could enhance active citizenship as well as a shared cultural European history. It was made of 5 main actions under which several projects are done by local supporters who show their projects to their national agency. Allowed participants were young people who are between 13 and 30 years old. Other people could be part of this too. Older youth workers who are part of European youth events and are citizens of a European Union country could be part of the program. Source The program was given a budget of 885 million euros. Analysis of the program published in 2011 showed that in the years 2007-2009, more than 380,000 people took part in the different actions. Only 21,800 projects received a grant among 42,700 submissions. == References == http://ec.europa.eu/youth/tools/youth-in-action_en.htm http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/youth/index_en.php http://www.britishcouncil.org/youth-in-action Category:Youth organizations",
