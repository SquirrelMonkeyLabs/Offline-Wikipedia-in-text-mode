Oxford University Press. Web. 25 Jul. 2013. was an Italian architect. He was born in the Swiss canton of Ticino.\"Francesco Borromini.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Web. 30 Oct. 2010. He was an influential person in making Roman Baroque architecture. He was inspired by Michelangelo's works and the ruins of Antiquity. He created his own type of architecture using types of Classical architecture. He used geometry and put symbolism into his works. He was probably a self-taught taught scholar. Borromini was often sad and quick to anger. This resulted in him quitting some of his jobs.Blunt, Anthony (1979), Borromini, Harvard University Press, Belknap, p. 21 His conflicts led him to suicide in 1667. He did not have lots of influence at first. However, as time went on, his work was visible in other works.Blunt,(1979), p. 213-7 After the late 1800s, Borromini's work became popular for its inventiveness. == References == == Other websites == * A map giving the location of Borromini's buildings in Rome * Architectural drawings by Borrominis in der Albertina * Columbia University: Joseph Connors, Francesco Borromini: Opus Architectonicum, Milan, 1998: Introduction to Borromini's own description of the Casa dei Filippini * Borromini's own account of his suicide * * Borromini: rare interior color images Category:1599 births Category:1660s deaths Category:Italian architects Category:17th-century artists Category:Italian Roman Catholics",
