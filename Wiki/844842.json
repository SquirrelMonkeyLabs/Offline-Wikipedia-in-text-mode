 "text": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Peru may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same- sex sexual activity is legal in Peru. However, houses headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite- sex couples. In January 2007, the ex-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski stabled a rule prohibiting all types of discrimination and hate crimes by sexual orientation. On January 9, 2017, a same-sex couple between a Peruvian citizen and a Mexican citizen started a process to legalize same-sex marriage between those. The 7th Constitutional Court of Lima was in favor of recognizing same- sex marriage, performed on Mexico after. However, the Supreme Court of Peru declined its request. ==Foundations== ===Movimiento Homosexual de Lima=== In the 1980s, a foundation called Movimiento Homosexual de Lima (MHOL) started to fight for more LGBT rights. It was founded by a LGBT activist and ex- politician Óscar Ugarteche. In 2014, there was some cases of discrimination against LGBT people in MHOL. One example was to the MHOL's president. ==History== In their old civilizations, like the Moche and Chimu culture, homosexuality was seen as normal; there are ceramics about LGBT persons engaging in sexual activity between same-sex couples. ==Legislative summary== Same-sex sexual activity legal (since 1924) Same age of sexual activity consent between homosexual and heterosexual (since 2012) Anti-discrimination laws in job (since 2017) Anti-discrimination laws of goods and services (since 2017) Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (ej. indirect discrimination, hate speech) (since 2017) Hate crime laws including sexual orientation and gender identity (since 2017) Same-sex marriage (was proposed) Civil unions (recognition of same-sex couples) (was proposed) Adoption for single people regardless of sexual orientation Adoption by same-sex couples Joint adoption by same-sex couples Gays, lesbians, and bisexuals allowed to serve openly in the military (since 2009) Transgender people allowed to serve openly in the military Change legal gender (since 2016) Intersexual minors protected from surgical procedures counted as invasive Third gender option (non-binary, etc) Automatic parenting for both couples after birth Access to IVF for lesbians (women─women) Conversion therapy banned (normally not used now) Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples Men who have sex with men allowed to donate blood (never was prohibited) ==Gallery== Vasija Chimú sexual (M.
