 "text": "Rhizodus (meaning \"root tooth\") is an extinct genus of giant freshwater lobe- finned fish belonging to the group Rhizodontida. It was even bigger than the beluga sturgeon, making it the largest freshwater fish to have ever existed. Carbon-dated fossils show that Rhizodus went extinct 290 million years ago. The two species are: * Rhizodus hibberti Owen, 1840 (type species) * Rhizodus serpukhovensis Smirnova, 2022 == Description == What makes Rhizodus so unique among other large rhizodonts such as Barameda were the massive 22 cm (8.7 in) teeth. They were used to crunch and kill prey into digestible bits, rather than swallowing them whole. This prehistoric monstrosity weighed 4,000 kg and resembled a hulking acanthodian with ginormous teeth. On its body were large plates. == Taxonomy == Rhizodus is the type genus of the Rhizodontida, a group of lobe-finned fishes. == Species info == === Rhizodus hibberti === Rhizodus hibberti is the type species of Rhizodus and is from the Vis√©an stage of the United Kingdom. === Rhizodus serpukhovensis === Rhizodus serpukhovensis is from the Serpukhovian of Russia. However, it is not well known. == What it ate == The diet of Rhizodus included medium-sized fish and other tetrapods. Rhizodus lunged at terrestrial prey like a crocodile. == Some images == == Related pages == * Strunius * Balistes vegai * Eusthenopteron * List of prehistoric bony fish genera == References == # \"Rhizodus hibberti\". www.europeana.eu.
