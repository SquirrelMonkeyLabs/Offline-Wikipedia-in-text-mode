Cyan is a secondary color of light, along with magenta and yellow. The primary colors of light are: blue, red and green. Cyan is made by mixing green and blue light. Cyan is the opposite of red and is halfway between blue and green. ==Meaning of cyan== * Cyan is associated with making someone feel better and protection, as well as being associated with good health from getting exercise by going swimming. This is because the water in a swimming pool is usually colored cyan from having a plaster white bottom that reflects the blue sky. The tiles of a swimming pool are often colored cyan, which makes the cyan color of the water in a swimming pool even more intense. * Cyan is a restful, calming color that symbolizes relaxation, especially that shade of cyan known as bright turquoise (shown below) which can be the color of the water in lagoons in tropical countries where people go swimming on their vacation. * The shade of Cyan called medium aquamarine (shown below) is used for the uniforms of nurses and surgeons and also used to paint rooms in hospitals because it is regarded as a color that calms and relaxes the patients. ==Tones of the Cyan color comparison chart == Rainshower (Sharpie) (Hex: #EDFEFF) (RGB: 237, 254, 255) Bubbles (Xona.com Color List) (Hex: #E7FEFF) (RGB: 231, 254, 255) Light Cyan (web color) (Hex: #E1FFFF) (RGB: 225, 255, 255) Alice Blue (web color) (Hex: #F0F8FF) (RGB: 240, 248, 255) Pale Turquoise (web color) (Hex: #AFEEEE) (RGB: 175, 238, 238) Powder Blue (web color) (Hex: #B0E0E6) (RGB: 176, 224, 230) Light Blue (Hex: #ADD8E6) (RGB: 173, 216, 230) Ultra Blue (Blizzard Blue) (Crayola) (Hex: #A3E3ED) (RGB: 163, 227, 237) Pale Robin Egg Blue (Hex: #96DED1) (RGB: 150, 222, 205) Light Keppel (Keppel Light (Xona.com color list)) (Hex: #8DDCD3) (RGB: 141, 220, 211) Aquamarine (Crayola) (web color) (Light Teal) (Hex: #7FFFD4) (RGB: 127, 255, 212) Aquamarine Blue (Crayola Aquamarine) (Hex: #71D9E2) (RGB: 113, 217, 226) Baby Blue (Hex: 89CFFD) (RGB: 137, 207, 240) Electric Blue (Hex: 7DF9FF) (RGB: 125, 249, 255) Cyan (web color \"Aqua\") (Hex: #00FFFF) (RGB: 0, 255, 255) Turquoise Blue (Hex: #00FFEF) (RGB: 0, 255, 239) Bright Turquoise (Hex: #08E8DE) (RGB: 8, 232, 222) Turquoise (web color) (Hex: #40E0D0) (RGB: 64, 224, 208) Maya Blue (Hex: #73C2FB) (RGB: 115, 194, 215) Capri (web color \"Deep Sky Blue\") (Hex: #00BFFF) (RGB: 0, 191, 255) Process Cyan (Pigment Cyan) (Printer's Cyan)(Deep Aqua) (Hex: #00B7EB) (RGB: 0, 183, 235) Bright Cerulean (Crayola Cerulean) (Hex: #02A4D3) (RGB: 2, 164, 211) Deep Turquoise (web color \"Dark Turquoise\") (Hex: #00CED1) (RGB: 0, 206, 209) Robin Egg Blue (Hex: #00CCCC) (RGB: 0, 204, 204) Medium Turquoise (web color) (Hex: #48D1CC) (RGB: 72, 209, 204) Medium Aquamarine (web color) (Hex: #66CDAA) (RGB: 102, 205, 170) Keppel (Xona.com color list) (Hex: #3AB09E) (RGB: 58, 176, 158) Light Sea Green (web color) (Hex: #20B2AA) (RGB: 32, 178, 170) Light Teal Blue (Crayola Teal Blue) (Hex: #18A7B5) (RGB: 24, 167, 181) Water (Traditional Japanese colors) (Hex: #96ABA5) (RGB: 134, 171, 165) Cadet Blue (web color) (Hex: #5F9EA0) (RGB: 95, 158, 109) Viridian (Hex: #40826D) (RGB: 64, 130, 109) Pine Green (Crayola) (Hex: #01796F) (RGB: 1, 121, 111) Dark Cyan (web color) (Hex: #008B8B) (RGB: 0, 139, 139) Teal (web color) (Hex: #008080) (RGB: 0, 128, 128) Water Blue (RAL 5021) (Hex: #256D7B) (RGB: 37, 109, 123) Teal Blue (Hex: #367588) (RGB: 54, 117, 136) Blue-Green (Crayola) (Hex: #0D98BA) (RGB: 13, 152, 186) Bondi Blue (Hex: #0095B6) (RGB: 0, 149, 182) Rich Electric Blue (Hex: #0892D0) (RGB: 8, 146, 208) Cerulean (Hex: #007BA7) (RGB: 0, 123, 167) Steel Blue (web color) (Hex: #4682B4) (RGB: 70, 130, 180) Medium Electric Blue (Hex: #035096) (RGB: 3, 80, 150) Dark Electric Blue (Hex: #536878) (RGB: 83, 104, 120) Midnight Green (Eagle Green) (Dark Teal) (Hex: #004953) (RGB: 0, 73, 83) Charleston Green (Hex: #1A2118) (RGB: 26, 33, 24) ==Related pages== * List of colors * Aqua * Aquamarine * Blue-green * Electric blue * Teal * Turquoise * Viridian Category:Shades of blue Category:Shades of cyan Category:Shades of green",
