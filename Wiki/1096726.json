 "text": "Scheenstia is an extinct genus of freshwater and marine ray-finned fish from the Upper Jurassicâ€“Lower Cretaceous of Europe. The teeth of this genus are called \"toadstones\" and were believed to be found in the head of a toad. It is part of a family called the Lepidotidae in the order Lepisosteiformes. It is related to the much better-known Lepidotes. == Appearance == A large fish, Scheenstia, could exceed one meter. It had a robust body and rounded teeth, perfect for squashing hard-bodied animals. It was probably a relatively slow swimmer. The body shape resembles the famous Lepidotes. == Image gallery == == Related pages == * Lepidotes == References == == Sources == * * Category:Extinct fish Category:Lepisosteiformes Category:Jurassic Category:Cretaceous Category:Animals of Europe Category:Freshwater fish Category:Marine fish genera",
