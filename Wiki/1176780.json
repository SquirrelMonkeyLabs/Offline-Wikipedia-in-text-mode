 "text": "Ola Ray (born August 26, 1960) is an American model and actress, best known for her role as the girlfriend in Michael Jackson's iconic music video for \"Thriller.\" She has also appeared in various television shows and films. Her involvement in the \"Thriller\" music video has made her a recognizable figure in pop culture. Ray had previously voiced her displeasure about the challenges she faced in obtaining royalties from her involvement in Thriller. Ray first placed the blame on Michael Jackson. In an attempt to collect unpaid royalties, she finally filed a lawsuit against Jackson in May 2009. Conrad Murray, Jackson's physician, neglected him, and he passed away on June 25 at the age of 50, less than two months later. The lawsuit was settled by Michael Jackson's estate in 2012.
