 "text": "The Creation Museum is a 75,000 square foot museum near Petersburg, Kentucky, United States. It was made to tell the story of Young Earth creationism. The museum shows its view of the theory of the start of the universe, life, mankind, and man's early history. It is based on the book of Genesis in the Bible. This book is the story of how God made the Earth, and all of its life forms in just six days. This is said to have happened about 6000 years ago. The museum rejects evolution, and points to alternative explanations to answer evolutionist's objections. The museum has a zoo, botanical gardens, planetarium, theater, bookshop, cafe, and zip-line. > \"The state-of-the-art 75,000-square-foot museum brings the pages of the > Bible to life, casting its characters and animals in dynamic form and > placing them in familiar settings. Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden. > Children play and dinosaurs roam near Edenâ€™s Rivers. The serpent coils > cunningly in the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Majestic murals, > great masterpieces brimming with pulsating colors and details, provide a > backdrop for many of the settings.\" - The Creation Museum website The Creation Museum is run by Answers in Genesis. ==References== == Other websites == *Official Creation Museum website *Answers in Genesis' website Category:Museums in the United States Category:Christian organizations based in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Kentucky",
