Several people have been killed in armed attacks while reports of businesses and vehicles being vandalized and burned have been reported. Several police officers and prison guards were also kidnapped. ==Attacks== On 9 January 2024, organized crime groups in Ecuador issued threats of \"war\", prompting the country's president to declare a state of armed internal conflict. On the same day, gunmen entered a television studio in Guayaquil, where they took journalists hostage during a live newscast. Reports of armed attacks throughout Guayaquil were reported, mainly in prisons, markets, roads, and universities. The large-scale attacks were a combination of responses to the escape of Los Choneros leader José Adolfo Macías Villamar in Guayaquil, and President Daniel Noboa declaring a state of emergency and then an internal state of war. Explosions were also reported across the country, particularly in Guayaquil, Cuenca, Machala, and Loja, as well as in Esmeraldas and Los Rios Provinces. Banks, markets, and shops were closed throughout the country in cities such as Quito and Guayaquil to protect merchants and customers from armed attacks. On 11 January, two people were killed and nine others were injured in an arson attack on a nightclub in Coca. On 13 January, the government announced that all 178 prison guards and other employees held hostage in prisons across the country since that start of the unrest by the gangs had been freed. ==Response== President Daniel Noboa said that the country was having an \"internal armed conflict\" and ordered the military to carry out operations to stop armed groups. ==Background== Since 2018, Ecuador has seen an increase in wave of violence as the country has become a critical cocaine transit point, and organized crime groups compete for control of drug routes and prisons. Hundreds of prison inmates have been killed in prison fights. According to The Washington Post, intelligence analysts said that the attacks may have been caused by a recent investigation into links between drug traffickers, criminal gangs, and political operators. The operation, known as Metastasis, led to the arrests of at least 20 top security officials and judges in December 2023. ==References== Category:2024 crimes Category:2024 in South America Category:2020s in Ecuador Category:Conflicts in 2024 Category:Crime in South America Category:January 2024 events Category:Murder in the 2020s",
