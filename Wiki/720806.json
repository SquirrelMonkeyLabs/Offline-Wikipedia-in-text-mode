Its main opponent is the Australian Labor Party (ALP), until it collapsed in 2025 after a historic defeat at that year's election. The Coalition was in government from the 2013 federal election until their defeat in the 2022 federal election. During that time, the group was led by Prime Ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, and Scott Morrison. ==References== Category:Political parties in Australia",
