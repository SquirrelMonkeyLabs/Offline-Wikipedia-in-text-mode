That was when the country became a separate country from the United Kingdom. Before that, the anthem was \"God Save the Queen\", retained as the royal anthem. ==Lyrics== :Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahama Land! :March on to glory, your bright banners waving high. :See how the world marks the manner of your bearing! :Pledge to excel through love and unity. :Pressing onward, march together :To a common loftier goal; :Steady sunward, though the weather :Hide the wide and treacherous shoal. :Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahama Land; :Till the road you have lead unto your God... ::March on, Bahamaland! ==References== Category:North American anthems Category:National symbols of the Bahamas",
