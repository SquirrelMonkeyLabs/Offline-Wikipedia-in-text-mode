The town's name in Welsh means \"Cybi's fort\". It used to have a large aluminium smelting industry, using the large smelters on the outskirts of the town. However, the aluminium company closed in September 2009. The Anglesey Coastal Path starts and finishes here. ==Transportation== As well as a busy port, the town also has a busy railway station.
