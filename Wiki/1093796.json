 "text": "The Akhbaris are a part of Twelverism. Unlike the Usulis they follow only the Qur'an and Hadith as their source without aql (logic) and ijma (consensus). They reject the usoli version of ilm al rijal (Hadith science) and taqleed (following without proof) in ijtaihad (making rulings) to a fallible being. The term akhbari originated from the daughter of imam Al-Jawad calling the companions of the imams ashab al-akhbar companions of the akhbar (news).Kamal al-Deen Volume 1 Page 535 ==References== Category:Shia Islam",
