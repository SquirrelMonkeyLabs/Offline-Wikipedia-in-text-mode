 "text": "Haikouichthys is an extinct early fish-like craniate. These creatures have backbones and distinct heads, and lived about 530 million years ago, during the Cambrian explosion. Haikouichthys had a defined skull and other characters which suggest it is a true craniate, and perhaps one of the earliest fishes. Cladistic analysis indicates that the animal is probably a basal chordate or a basal craniate.Paleos. It does not show enough detail to be definitely included in either stem group.Donoghue P.C.J. & Purnell M.A. 2005. Genome duplication, extinction and vertebrate evolution.
