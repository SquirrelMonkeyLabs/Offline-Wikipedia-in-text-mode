 "text": "Crystallinity is a physical property of a solid that acts like a crystal. The degree of crystallinity of a crystal has a big influence on hardness, density, transparency and diffusion. Crystallinity can be measured using x-ray diffraction, but calorimetric techniques are also commonly used. Examples would include: sodium chloride (table salt). Category:Physical quantity",
