He became the No.1 GK for the club in August of that season. His first game was on August 16, 1995 in a league match against Bellmare Hiratsuka. The first time he played for Japan was on February 15, 1998 against Australia. He played in three World Cup finals in a row. He played all the Japan matches in the 2002 World Cup finals, but Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi played instead of him in the 1998 and 2006 finals. He played for Japan as the No.1 goalkeeper because Kawaguchi was injured. However, Narazaki himself got a broken finger in 2009. After it healed, he was named in the 2010 World Cup squad. He was one of two Japanese players (the other being Kawaguchi) to play in 4 World Cups in a row. However, even though he played well in the qualifiers, he did not play in the tournament. Eiji Kawashima was played instead. He played once more for Japan when he captained the team to a 2-1 victory over Guatemala on 7 September 2010. He then retired from playing for his country. ==Statistics== |- |1995||rowspan=\"4\"|Yokohama Flügels||rowspan=\"4\"|J1 League||23||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||25||0 |- |1996||23||0||2||0||14||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||39||0 |- |1997||24||0||5||0||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||36||0 |- |1998||34||0||5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||39||0 |- |1999||rowspan=\"9\"|Nagoya Grampus Eight||rowspan=\"9\"|J1 League||25||0||5||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||34||0 |- |2000||30||0||2||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||34||0 |- |2001||28||0||1||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||35||0 |- |2002||30||0||3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||33||0 |- |2003||28||0||2||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||36||0 |- |2004||26||0||2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||28||0 |- |2005||32||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||33||0 |- |2006||24||0||2||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||28||0 |- |2007||29||0||2||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||35||0 |- |2008||rowspan=\"11\"|Nagoya Grampus||rowspan=\"9\"|J1 League||30||0||1||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||33||0 |- |2009||26||0||3||0||0||0||6||0||35||0 |- |2010||34||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||34||0 |- |2011||24||0||3||0||2||0||6||0||34||0 |- |2012||32||0||4||0||1||0||7||0||44||0 |- |2013||34||0||1||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||41||0 |- |2014||34||0||2||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||42||0 |- |2015||34||0||0||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||40||0 |- |2016||27||0||1||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||31||0 |- |2017||J2 League||29||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||29||0 |- |2018||J1 League||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||0||0 660||0||49||0||71||0||19||0||799||0 660||0||49||0||71||0||19||0||799||0 |} Japan National Football Team Database |- |1998||2||0 |- |1999||3||0 |- |2000||9||0 |- |2001||1||0 |- |2002||10||0 |- |2003||12||0 |- |2004||9||0 |- |2005||4||0 |- |2006||0||0 |- |2007||1||0 |- |2008||12||0 |- |2009||6||0 |- |2010||8||0 |- !Total||77||0 |} ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Nara Prefecture Category:Japan international footballers Category:J1 League players Category:J2 League players Category:Yokohama Flügels players Category:Nagoya Grampus players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:2010 FIFA World Cup players Category:2001 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2003 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2005 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:Footballers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:1996 AFC Asian Cup players",
