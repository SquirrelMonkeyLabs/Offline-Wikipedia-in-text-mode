 "text": "The WAGR C class were a total of 22 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1902 to 1961. The C class were originally built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works (BLW) of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA in 1902 for use on mixed passenger services and mail trains on the Eastern Railway, Eastern Goldfields Railway, and the Great Southern Railway, later venturing further to the Northern Railway and South Western mainline. 10 of the class were built at Midland Railway Workshops as the Ca class, and the original was rebuilt from 1908 to 1918. From 1929 seventeen were superheated becoming the Cs class. Four were allocated to the Railway Department's own sawmill at Banksiadale in the early 1950s becoming the last of the class in service and were sold off along with the sawmill in 1961, and after road transport rendered the locos surplus to requirements they were sent to Subiaco and scrapped in 1964.
