 "text": "Ameerega berohoka is a frog. It lives in Matto Grosso Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is 19.2 to 23.4 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 21.9 to 24.3 mm long. There are disks on the toes for climbing. There is no webbed skin on the feet. There are bright orange spots on the back legs and near where the legs meet the body. There are light yellow stripes on both sides of the body. The sides of the body are black in color and the belly is white or blue in color. Scientists say this color tells animals that want to eat the frog that the frog has poison in its skin. The pupil of the eye is round in shape. ==Name== The name berohoka means \"big river\" in the Karajas language. ==Home== This frog lives in Cerrado places. People have seen it in forests, on farms, and in other places. People especially see it in places below the Araguaia River. People have seen it between 200 and 500 meters above sea level. The frog lives in one protected park, Parque Estadual Serra Azul. It also lives near Emas National Park. ==Young== Scientists think that this frog has young the way other frogs in Ameerega do: The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make dams for electricity, make farms, make places for animals to eat grass, and make charcoal. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
