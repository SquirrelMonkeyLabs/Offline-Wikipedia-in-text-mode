 "text": "The Flemish Movement is an umbrella term which has many political groups in the Belgian region of Flanders and, less commonly, in French Flanders. They are made up of groups who wish to promote Flemish culture and the Dutch language as well as those wanting a greater political independence for Flanders within Belgium. It also supports nationalists who want Flanders to be independent from Belgium, either through outright independence or to be reunited with the Netherlands. ==History== ===21st century=== ====2010s==== In recent history, the Flemish Movement has become more powerful and important in Belgian politicians.
