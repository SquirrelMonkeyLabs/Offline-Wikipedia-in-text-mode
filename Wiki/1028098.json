Despite not having a girls' team nearby, Meghna played cricket with the boys. Her mom mentioned that Meghna was the only girl who played cricket with the boys in their area. When Meghna was 10, she started training seriously with a coach named Lakshyaraj Tyagi. She practiced a lot, even twice a day! Her dad drove her every day to the Nehru Stadium in Bijnor, which was 24 kilometers away from their home. Her coach, Mr. Tyagi, was really impressed with her skills. He once said that on Meghna's first day, the other players found it hard to hit her bowling. All her dedication paid off in 2019. Meghna played amazingly in a tournament, catching the eyes of big cricket teams. In 2021, she got to play for the Indian women's cricket team in matches against Australia and Pakistan. == References == Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Indian cricketers Category:People from Uttar Pradesh",
