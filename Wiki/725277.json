 "text": "Fetoscopy is a medical procedure to examine and treat an unborn child. It is only done in specialized hospitals. Because it is difficult to do, it is only done for severe illnesses. The complication that occurs most often is that the baby is born early, or that a miscarriage occurs. This happens in up to 5% of the cases. In many cases, fetoscopy is completented or replaced by medical ultrasound. Category:Medical procedures Category:Pregnancy and childbirth Category:Obstetrics and gynecology",
