I will come back and climb the tree and pick a flower full of dew, and I'll give it to my brunette to tie it in her hair. Asturias, land of my young years, Asturias, land of my dreams, oh brother, if you knew Asturias, you would understand why I am crying. I will come back, I will see Oviedo, I'll grab a rifle and a grenade I will go to fight for Asturias, my beloved homeland. ==References== Category:Asturias Category:Spanish anthems",
