 "text": "Roger Brooke Taney (March 17, 1777 â€“ October 12, 1864) was the fifth Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1836 until his death in 1864. He came after John Marshall and despite the many influential things done by his predecessor, still was able to write several major opinions. His decision in Dred Scott to send a slave living in a free state back to his master in a slave state canceled out several compromises that had been keeping the Union together. When president Abraham Lincoln began using powers not normally given to the presidency to put certain rights on hold, Taney kept on trying to overrule him. These attempts were ignored and rumored to have almost led to Taney's arrest. When Taney County, Missouri was officially organized in 1837, it was named in his honor. At the time Abraham Lincoln became president, Taney swore in Lincoln. ==References== Category:1777 births Category:1864 deaths Category:Chief justices of the United States Category:Politicians from Maryland Category:United States Attorneys General Category:Lawyers from Maryland",
