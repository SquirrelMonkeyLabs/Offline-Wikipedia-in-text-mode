 "text": "The existence of a Roma people (Romniti)-inhabited land called Gyppe (Little Egypt) near the town of Modon in the Peloponnese in 1384, once a port of transit for pilgrims en route to the holy sites, in the Middle Ages is the origin of the name Gypsy. It is not known as to why people from Indian Punjab moved to the Balkans, there are many theories of speculative nature.
