 "text": "A bob cut, also known as a bob, is a short to medium length haircut, in which the hair is usually cut straight around the head at about where the jaw is, but no longer than shoulder-length. It usually has bangs at the front. The standard bob cut shows the back of the neck and keeps all of the hair above the shoulders. Hairdressers in the 1920s, whose training was mainly in arranging and curling long hair, did not realize that short hairstyles for women had become popular, and many barbers in many cities found lines of women outside their shops, waiting to have short bob cuts.
