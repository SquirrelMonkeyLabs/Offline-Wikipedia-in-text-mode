 "text": "Five World Trade Center, also referred to as 130 Liberty Street, is a planned building to be located in New York City. It was planned to be on the site of the Deutsche Bank Building. The original building was demolished in 2002 after it was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks. In June 2007, it was announced that financial service JPMorgan Chase planned to develop the building as a new J.P. Morgan Investment Bank world headquarters. The bank changed their mind and the site became a parking lot in 2014. == Sources == Category:Skyscrapers in New York City Category:September 11 attacks Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
