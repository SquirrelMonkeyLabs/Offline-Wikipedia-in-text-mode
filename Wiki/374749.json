Despite its scientific name Nimravides does not belong to the Nimravidae, but belongs to the family Felidae. The earlier species of the genus are smaller and more primitive than the later forms. The tiger-sized Nimravides catacopsis resembles the primitive Machairodus aphanistus, a species known from the late Miocene of Eurasia. *Felinae **†Nimravides ***†Nimravides nimravidus ***†Nimravides catacopsis ***†Nimravides pedionomus ***†Nimravides hibbardi ***†Nimravides galiani ***†Nimravides thinobates ==References== == Other websites == *Nimravides galiani *Nimravides thinobates *Nimravides hibbardi *Nimravides *Nimravides pedionomus *N. catacopis *Nimravides List Category:Machairodonts Category:Fossils Category:Saber-toothed cats Category:Miocene",
