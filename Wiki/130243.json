 "text": "Saves the Day are a band who have played many genres of music during their career. They formed together in 1997, and have often changed their lineup, with singer Chris Conley being the only original member who is still in the band. At first, Saves the Day was influenced heavily by melodic hardcore band Lifetime. At first, their songs had macabre lyrics and a lot of power chords. In 2001, they started to have more of a pop sound. The band started to record a trilogy of albums in 2005. The first album, Sound the Alarm (2006), is more similar to the band's original sound than the band's previous albums. The second album, Under the Boards, was released in fall 2007 and mixed together many previous records' sounds. Daybreak, the concluding album in the trilogy, was released in 2011. They started recording it after a string of shows in late October 2008. == Albums == === Studio albums === * Can't Slow Down - 1998 * Through Being Cool - 1999 * Stay What You Are - 2001 * In Reverie - 2003 * Sound the Alarm - 2006 * Under the Boards - 2007 * Daybreak - 2011 Category:Emo bands Category:American punk bands Category:American rock bands Category:Indie rock bands Category:Musical groups from New Jersey Category:2000s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in New Jersey",
