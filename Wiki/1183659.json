 "text": "The Suriname rock frog (Anomaloglossus surinamensis) is a frog. Scientists found it in Suriname and French Guiana. ==Home== This frog lives in the dead leaves on the ground near small streams in forest that has never been cut down on mountains. Scientists saw the frog in two protected places: Kaw Natural Reserve and Nouragura Reserve. ==Young== The male frogs call to the female frogs during the rainy time of year. Scientists think these frogs have young in the same way as other frogs in Anomaloglossus: The female lays eggs on leaves and the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in big danger of dying out. Human beings dig for gold in the frog's home even though it is against the law to dig for gold there. Scientists think the disease chytridiomycosis could kill this frog because they have seen the fungus that causes it, , on other amphibians in French Guiana. Climate change could also kill this frog. Because it lives so high above sea level, it would be hard for the frog to move somewhere cooler or wetter if its home becomes too hot or dry. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
