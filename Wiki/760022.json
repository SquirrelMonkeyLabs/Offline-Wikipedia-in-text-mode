Du was born in China's Shandong province. Du was found dead in his Herziliya, Israel apartment on 17 May 2020, aged 57. His death is not being treated as suspicious but is being investigated. His death came in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, and only a few days after Du published an op-ed in the Jerusalem Post protesting American Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Israel attempting to persuade the Israeli government to limit its relationship with China. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Ambassadors of China Category:People from Shandong",
