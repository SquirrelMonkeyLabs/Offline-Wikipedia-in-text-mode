 "text": "The Haganah was an underground militia group that Vladimir Jabotinsky created to protect the Jews in British Mandatory Palestine from Arab attacks. It also helped Jewish refugees get safely to the British Mandate of Palestine from Europe. Jabotinsky left after the Haganah started to support Labour Zionism. The Haganah ended up being led by David Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion and the Haganah still started to fight the British in 1939 when the British tried to stop Jewish immigration and tried to stop the creation of the state of Israel. But after Hitler attacked Poland, the Haganah stopped fighting against the British and started to fight for the British Empire against the Nazis. In 1944, Ben- Gurion helped the British fight against Menachem Begin and the Irgun and he helped the British fight against Yitzhak Shamir and the Lechi. After the war ended, Ben-Gurion and the Haganah fought against the British to get them to let the Jews have a country. After, Israel became a country, the Haganah, Irgun and Lechi became the Israeli army, also known as the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Category:Mandatory Palestine Category:Zionism",
