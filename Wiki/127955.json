Ekiga supports both the SIP and H.323 (based on OpenH323) protocols and is fully interoperable with any other SIP compliant application and with Microsoft NetMeeting. It supports many high-quality audio and video codecs. Ekiga was initially made by Damien Sandras in order to graduate from the Universit√© catholique de Louvain. It is currently developed by a community-based team led by Sandras.
