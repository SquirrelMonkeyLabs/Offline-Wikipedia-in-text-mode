 "text": "A sanction is usually a restriction imposed by law or political power. The word is ambiguous. Sanctions can be agreed by international organisations, but are more commonly unilateral sanctions that are imposed by individual countries. They may affect a whole country or just individuals or groups of people. There is no real agreement on whether sanctions work. The term sanction does not include military force. The same word can be used for restrictions imposed by the courts. ==References== Category:International relations",
