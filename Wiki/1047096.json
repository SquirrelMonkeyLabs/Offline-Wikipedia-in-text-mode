Scientists have only seen it near where they first found it: 2023 meters above sea level in Silent Valley National Park. People have seen it between 1800 and 2200 meters above sea level. Scientists found one adult male frog that was about 19.8 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of its back was pale brown in color and it had many small spikes. There were white spots near its legs. The skin of the frog's belly was pink-white in color. The iris of the eye was the color of copper on top and dark brown on the bottom. Scientists saw the frogs in the leaf litter on the forest floor and on low, woody plants. The scientists named this frog for Mr. Lechiyappan of the Mudugar tribe. He worked as a forest tracker at Silent Valley National Park and helped it become a national park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
