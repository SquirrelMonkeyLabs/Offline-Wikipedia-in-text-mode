 "text": "On 7 May 2025, India conducted missile strikes on Pakistan and in the disputed Pakistan occupied Kashmir, under codename Operation Sindoor (). The strikes were launched in response to the religiously motivated Pahalgam terrorist attack that was allegedly supported by Pakistan. The conflict is infamous because in this conflict, Pakistan endangered passanger aircrafts by using them as cover for carrying out their military activities. India responded that it has a firm resolution to fight terrorism, and launched Operation Sindoor. It involved coordinated strikes by the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, marking one of the most significant tri-services missions in recent years. The name Sindoor symbolizes marriage and the safety of husbands in Hindu culture. The primary goal of Operation Sindoor was to eliminate the terrorist camps, hideouts, and dismantle the infrastructure used by used by alleged Pakistani- supported militant organizations. == Background == On April 22, 2025, a terrorist attack took place in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Twenty-six people were killed, including 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen. India said that the attack was planned by terrorists based in Pakistan. In the weeks preceding the Pahalgam attack, India acquired the extradition of former Pakistan Army officer Tahawwur Rana, who was linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba and convicted (in the US) for supporting 2008 Mumbai attacks. === Speculations on Pakistan's involvement === On 17th April, five days prior to the 2025 Pahalgam Attack, Asim Munir, the 11th chief of the army staff of Pakistan Army, had publicly endorsed the two-nation theory while addressing expats, saying: > Our forefathers thought we are different from Hindus in every possible > aspect of life. Our religions are different, our customs are different, our > traditions are different, our thoughts are different, our ambitions are > different. That was the foundation of the two-nation theory that was laid > there. On April 26, 2025, Munir reiterated his views on the two-nation theory during a passing out parade ceremony at the Pakistan Military Academy, stating that the theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one. Munir's two-nation theory speech described as \"unusually provocative\" to a BBC Urdu journalist Farhat Javed Rabani, complicated Pakistan’s diplomacy just before the 2025 Pahalgam attack. The timing raised tensions and speculation on the involvement of Pakistan in the attack. Hashim Musa, one of the terrorists in the Pahalgam attack, used to be a para commando in Pakistan’s Special Service Group (SSG), which is an elite part of the Pakistan Army. He was trained in secret missions and special fighting skills. After being removed from the army, Musa joined the banned terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. He entered Jammu and Kashmir in September 2023. Security officials learned about his background when they questioned local helpers who supported the attackers. These helpers said Musa used his army training to plan and carry out several attacks in Kashmir, including the deadly Pahalgam massacre. == The Operation == * India named the action \"Operation Sindoor.\" * The Indian armed forces targeted nine sites linked to terrorist groups across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. * The strikes focused on places like Bahawalpur (Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters) and Muridke (Lashkar-e-Taiba headquarters), along with other important sites. * The attacks used precision weapons, including missiles and loitering munitions (kamikaze drones). * India said the operation was \"focused, measured and non- escalatory.\" No Pakistani military bases were targeted, only terrorist infrastructure. * All strikes were planned to avoid civilian and military casualties as much as possible. == The Targets == Multiple targets were selected based on intelligence inputs on specific terrorist groups. * Markaz Subhan Allah, Bahawalpur – Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) This is the main center for JeM, a big terrorist group. It is in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. Many leaders and members of JeM stayed and trained here. * Markaz Taiba, Muridke – Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT) This is the main base for LeT, another terrorist group. It is in Muridke, near Lahore, Pakistan. People who attacked Mumbai in 2008 were trained here. * Sarjal Training Grounds, Tehra Kalan – Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) This is a training place for JeM in Tehra Kalan, Punjab, Pakistan. It was used to send terrorists into India. * Mehmoona Joya, Sialkot – Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) This camp is in Sialkot, Pakistan. It belongs to Hizbul Mujahideen, a group that sends fighters into Jammu and Kashmir. * Markaz Ahle Hadith, Barnal – Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) This is another LeT training place in Barnal, Pakistan. * Markaz Abbas, Kotli – Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) This camp is in Kotli, in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. It is used by JeM for training and storing weapons. * Maskar Raheel Shahid, Kotli – Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) This is a secret camp in Kotli for Hizbul Mujahideen. It has places for fighters to stay and keep their weapons. * Shawai Nalla Camp, Muzaffarabad – Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT) This camp is in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It is used by LeT for training and planning attacks. * Syedna Bilal Camp, Muzaffarabad – Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) This is another JeM camp in Muzaffarabad. It is used for training and storing weapons. == Results == The Indian government reported that Operation Sindoor resulted in the deaths of 80–100 terrorists, targeting key terrorist infrastructure across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Satellite imagery from multiple independent sources, including Maxar, Indian firm KAWASPACE, and Chinese firm MIZAZVISION, confirmed extensive damage to terrorist camps and Pakistani military infrastructure. Maxar imagery verified precise strikes on JeM's Jamia Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur and LeT's Markaz Taiba in Muridke, showing significant destruction of training facilities and administrative buildings. Jaish-e- Mohammed chief Masood Azhar claimed that 10 of his family members and four close associates were killed in the strikes. The operation marked the first joint action by all three Indian military services since the 1971 war. Satellite imagery further documented damage to Pakistani airbases. At Sargodha Airbase, KAWASPACE imagery revealed strikes on runway 14/32 at two locations, including near its intersection with runway 06/24, disrupting operational capabilities. At Bholari Airbase, KAWASPACE imagery showed severe damage to a hangar, with visible debris and structural collapse, corroborated by MIZAZVISION imagery. At Jacobabad Airbase, KAWASPACE imagery indicated a hangar on the main apron was hit, with minor secondary damage suspected to the air traffic control building. At Nur Khan Airbase, MIZAZVISION imagery showed targeted strikes on infrastructure and ground support vehicles, aimed at crippling logistics. The Economic Times also reported visible damage to Nur Khan and other Pakistani airbases, aligning with the satellite data. Pakistan retaliated by targeting Indian border cities with artillery fire, resulting in 16 civilian deaths and 59 injuries. Pakistan claimed to have shot down five Indian aircraft, including Rafale jets, using J-10C fighters and PL-15 missiles, with some reports mentioning a Rafale M88 engine found in a field in India. However, Pakistan has till now not provided any proof to substantiate this. Pakistan shared doctored/photoshopped satellite images in their official press briefing claiming their strikes were successful but upon independent verification by OSNIT and checking Open source satellite imagery these claims were found to be false and no visible damage was seen on the targets. == Aftermath == * The Indian government stated that the operation was a direct response to terrorism in the region and not an act of war against Pakistan. * The situation along the border of Kashmir remained tense after the strikes. * Pakistan’s Minister of Defence, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, stated that India’s attacks “will not go unanswered”, as well as stating that Pakistan will only target military assets present in India in the future, he also claimed that the operation was ‘an act of war’. * Many international leaders such as Donald Trump, called India’s attack on Pakistan a ‘shame’, as well as offering help to bring peace to the region. * Other nations, such as China, Japan, Iran, Russia, the UK, France, and Qatar’s Foreign Ministry encouraged the two nations to exercise restraint, Israel pledges support to India over the attacks. * == References == Category:May 2025 events Category:2020s in India Category:2020s in Pakistan",
