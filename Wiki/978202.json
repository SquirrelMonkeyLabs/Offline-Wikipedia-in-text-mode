 "text": "\"O Sweet Saint Martin's Land\" is the anthem of Saint-Martin and Sint Maarten. == Lyrics == === English version === I Where over the world, say where, You find an island there, So lovely small with nations free With people French and Dutch Though talking English much, As thee Saint Martin in the sea? O sweet Saint Martin's Land So bright by beach and strand With sailors on the sea and harbours free Where the chains of mountains green Variously in sunlight sheen ùÑÜ Oh I love thy Paradise, Nature beauty fairly nice ùÑá II How pretty between all green Flamboyants beaming gleam Of flowers red by sunlight set Thy cows and sheep and goats In meadows or on roads Thy donkeys keen I can't forget III Thy useful birds in white Their morn and evening flight Like aircraft-wings in unity Their coming down for food Then turning back to roost Bring home to me their harmony IV Saint Martin I love thy name In which Columbus' fame And memories of old are closed For me a great delight Thy Southern Cross the night May God the Lord protect thy coast! === French version === French original English translation I Find me a pearl so dear, as the island of St. Martin in the sea, chain of hills and valleys; rich golden brown beaches giving peace, give the rest in its bleak and all its waters. ùÑÜ St. Martin, St. Martin, So pretty in all its corners. ùÑá II What his flamboyant charm, their enchanting flowers, a whole bunch of flames. When the sun comes here, giving splendor, showing beauty, What splendor on all sides. III Its top \"Pic Paradis\", delights tourists here, hence its green works wonders; an unparalleled panorama, Seeing the plains, seeing the sea, colored blue and green. IV Flight of its pelicans, graceful and elegant when they hover high into the air, when they dive into the sea; Tell me the place where we see them, when based on their prey V His name always St. Martin Will in the never ending story, Christopher Columbus discovered it, gave it its name so dear, Patron god, God of goodness, guard it well in prosperity! ==References== Category:Dutch anthems Category:French anthems Category:North American anthems Category:Saint Martin Category:Sint Maarten",
