 "text": "The Stanley Parable is an interactive storytelling video game designed by Davey Wreden. The game was originally released on July 27, 2011 as a free modification for Half-Life 2. A high-definition stand-alone remake, including new story elements, was again designed by Davey Wreden together with Source engine modeler William Pugh and Davey Wreden and was released on October 17, 2013 for Microsoft Windows. Later updates of the game added support for OS X on December 19, 2013, and for Linux on September 9, 2015. The player has the opportunity to make numerous decisions on which paths, Stanley the protagonist, to take, and because at times the narrator says what Stanley will do next, the player can choose to ignore the narration and make a different choice. Every choice made by the player is commented on by the narrator, and depending on the choices the player makes, they will encounter different endings to the game before it restarts. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2011 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Art games Category:Existentialist video games Category:Indie video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Metafictional video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games",
