 "text": "The Italian Peninsula or Apennine Peninsula (, Penisola appenninica) is a large peninsula of Southern Europe. It extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Ionian and Adriatic Seas on the east and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is in between two larger peninsulas: the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. Because of the peninsula's shape, it is nicknamed Lo Stivale (\"The Boot\"). Three smaller peninsulas make it look similar to this shape. They are named Calabria (the \"toe\"), Salento (the \"heel\") and Gargano (the \"spur\"). The peninsula is about long, starting from the Po Valley in the north. The Apennine Mountains cover most of its length. It mainly has the Mediterranean climate, though in the mountainous parts the climate is much cooler. Since the reign of Roman Emperor Augustus (end of 1st century BC), the northern border of the peninsula has been set on the Alps drainage basin. Geographically, however, its northern end runs from the Magra to the Rubicon rivers, north of the Apennines in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. This definition does not include the Po Valley or the southern slopes of the Alps.De Agostini Ed., L'Enciclopedia Geografica - Vol. I - Italia, 2004, p.78Touring Club Italiano, Conosci l’Italia - Vol. I: L’Italia fisica, 1957 Nearly all of the peninsula is part of the Italian Republic, apart from San Marino and the Vatican City.
