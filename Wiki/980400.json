The Mick Jackson track was showcased in 1978 at Midem where, according to Mick Jackson: \"The Jacksons' manager [Peter Kerstin] heard the track being played...and took a recording of it...back in the States [where] The Jacksons quickly recorded a version so it would be out before mine.\"http://www.disco- disco.com/artists/mick.shtml In fact, the Mick Jackson recording was released by Atlantic Records in the United States in August 1978. According to Michael Jackson of the Jacksons, Bobby Colomby, who was producing the Jacksons' Destiny album, brought the group \"Blame It on the Boogie\". \"It was an uptempo, finger-poppin'-time type song that was a good vehicle for the band approach we wanted to cultivate. I had fun slurring the chorus: [the lyric] 'Blame It on the Boogie' could be sung in one breath without putting my lips together.\" ==References== Category:1978 songs Category:Disco songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:The Jackson 5 songs",
