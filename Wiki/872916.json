 "text": "Pithecopus rusticus is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it 1330 meters above sea level. This frog lives in grassy places in the forests on the Atlantic side (east side) of Brazil. Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place: They found it on private property in 2019. After the owner removed the grassy places, scientists could not find the frog again. Scientists think this frog might be dying because of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis and because human beings change the places where it lives. Some people may catch the frogs to sell as pets. Scientists believe this frog lays eggs on leaves over water and the tadpoles drop into the water after they hatch. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
