 "text": "Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, or HST, is a biomedical engineering and physician-scientist training programs in the United States. It was established in 1970 and is the collaborative program between Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Within the program, graduate and medical students are registered with both MIT and Harvard and work with faculty and affiliated faculty members from both communities. HST is a part of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and forms the London Society at Harvard Medical School. == Mission == HST's program aims to bring engineering, physical sciences, and biological sciences from the laboratory bench to the patient's bedside. Similarly, it also aims to bring clinical insight from the patient's bedside to the laboratory bench. Consequently, HST students are trained to have a deep and exposure in understanding of engineering and scientific fundamentals that complement with hands-on experience in the clinic or in industry. == References == Category:Harvard University Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology Category:1970 establishments in the United States Category:Medical education in the United States Category:Health technology",
