 "text": "The União da Juventude Monarquista (UJM), , is a Brazilian organization founded on May 18, 2024. The UJM defends the restoration of the monarchy in Brazil and other countries around the world, promoting a hybrid ideology that combines elements of left and right. Its main objective is the implementation of a hereditary parliamentary constitutional monarchy, where the head of state, titled emperor or empress, is chosen through dynastic succession, passing from mother to son or daughter. == History == The Monarchist Youth Union emerged in a context of growing dissatisfaction with the republican system and recurring political crises in Brazil. Founded by a group of young activists and intellectuals, the UJM proposes a governance model that seeks to combine the stability and tradition of the monarchy with modern democratic principles. == Ideology == The UJM advocates a system of government in which the head of state is a hereditary monarch, while day-to-day government is led by a prime minister elected by a parliament. This parliament would be elected by popular vote, ensuring that legislative and executive power reflects the will of the people, while the monarch exercises ceremonial and symbolic functions, representing the unity and continuity of the nation. A distinctive feature of the UJM proposal is egalitarian dynastic succession, where the throne is passed from mother to son or daughter, without gender discrimination. This model aims to promote gender equality within the monarchical institution, reflecting contemporary values of equality and justice. The Union of Monarchist Youth positions itself uniquely by integrating elements of left and right ideologies. In the economic sphere, UJM supports policies that promote both economic development and social justice. They defend a regulated market economy, with a strong social welfare system to reduce inequalities. On the social front, UJM aligns itself with progressive values, supporting equal rights for all citizens, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race or religion. At the same time, it preserves traditional and national values, defending Brazilian culture and history. Under the model proposed by the UJM, the parliament would be bicameral, composed of a lower house, whose members are directly elected by the people, and an upper house, which could include representatives from different sectors of society and regions of the country. The prime minister would be chosen by parliament and responsible for forming the government and administering public policies. The role of the emperor or empress would be primarily ceremonial, acting as a symbol of continuity and stability. The monarch would have the power to sanction laws and convene parliament, in addition to representing the country in international events and official ceremonies. ==References== Category:Organizations based in Brazil Category:Monarchists",
