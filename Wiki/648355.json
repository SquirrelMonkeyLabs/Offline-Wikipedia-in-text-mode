 "text": "Christopher Robin Milne (21 August 1920 â€“ 20 April 1996) was the son of author A. A. Milne. As a child, he was the inspiration of the character Christopher Robin in his father's Winnie-the-Pooh stories and in two books of poems. Milne gave the original stuffed animals that inspired the Pooh characters to the books' editor, who in turn donated them to the New York Public Library. He hated the idea of Winnie-the-Pooh being commercialized. Milne died in his sleep on 20 April 1996 in Totnes, Devon, aged 75. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Deaths from myasthenia gravis Category:People from London",
