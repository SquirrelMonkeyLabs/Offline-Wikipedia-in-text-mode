In the 13th, century it grew into an umbrella term for a large group of tribes united under the rule of Genghis Khan. == Religion == The polytheistic (believing in many gods) Mongols thought that good and evil spirits controlled the world. They also believed in a sky god, who ruled all the spirits. They called him \"Tengri\" (TENG gree), which means \"the great god of heaven\". The Mongols lived in fear of the spirits and hoped for blessings from them. Every yurt had small idols made of felt. The wives and daughters of the nobles made those idols at sewing parties. The Mongols believed that the idols protected their families and animals. Before every meal, they put food and drink on the idols' lips. They also prayed to them. The Mongols believed that some men, called \"shamans\" (SHAH muns), had power over the spirits. The shamans were the priests of the traditional Mongol religion, called \"shamanism\" (SHAH muh NIZ um). The shamans were medicine men and witch doctors and used a special language when doing their magical rituals. The Mongols talked to their shamans they made major big decisions and followed their advice. === Other religions === The later empire of the Mongols had many people with many religions, including Christians.
