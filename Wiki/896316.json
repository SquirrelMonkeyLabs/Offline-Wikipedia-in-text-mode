 "text": "Diaphoretickes is a large group of eukaryotic organisms. There are over 400,000 species. Most of the Earth's biomass which does photosynthesis is in this group. All the living things in Diaphoretickes are Eukaryotes: they are complicated cells with organelles. Most plants that make energy out of light are in Diaphoretickes. Only Euglenozoa and blue-green algae are not. The group includes: * Archaeplastida (red algae, glaucophytes, green algae and plants) * Cryptista * Haptista * SAR supergroup (stramenopiles, alveolates, and Rhizaria) * Telonemia In 2012, this megagroup was defined. == History == Burki led a team of scientists that named Diaphoretickes. They called it the \"plants+HC+SAR megagroup\" because it has plants (Archaeplastida), haptophytes, cryptomonads, and stramenopiles, alveolates, and rhizarians. That makes the acronyms HC and SAR. Other scientists call Diaphoretickes the \"SAR/HA Supergroup\" or \"Corticata with Rhizaria.\" The name \"Corticata\" comes from Cavalier-Smith's scientific idea that the cortical alveoli of glaucophytes and alveolates both came from the same ancestors. == References == Category:Eukaryotes Category:Photosynthesis Category:Algae Category:Plants",
