 "text": "Fauxbourdon, also called fauxbordon or false drone, is a method of writing music that became popular in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. It was used especially by composers from the Burgundian School, with Guillaume Du Fay being one of the most well-known composers. == Method == Fauxbourdon uses three voices that move in the same direction. The main melody, called the cantus firmus, is supported by two other parts: one is a sixth below, and the other is a perfect fourth below. These make a rich sound that makes the lyrics easy to understand. == History == The first example of fauxbourdon appears in a manuscript from around 1435, with several pieces by Du Fay. The method was designed to create a \"sweet\" and pleasant sound, different from the more harsh and open-sounding music of earlier times. Fauxbourdon was mostly used in church music, like hymns and psalms, where it was important to make the words clear. It was also used in more complex pieces, where composers could add decorations and variations to the basic structure. ==References== * * == Other Websites == * https://web.archive.org/web/20050825215322/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/Blair/Courses/MUSL242/dufay98.htm * http://www.dolmetsch.com/defsf.htm Category:Musical forms",
