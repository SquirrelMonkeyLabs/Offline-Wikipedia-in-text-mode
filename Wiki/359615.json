 "text": "The Sooglossidae (Seychelles frogs) are a family of frogs. They are found on the Seychelles Islands and India. All of the species are small land frogs, about in length. They hide under fallen leaves or in rock crevices. They lay their eggs on moist ground, rather than in water. One species lacks tadpoles, with the eggs hatching directly into froglets. The others carry the tadpoles on their back until metamorphosis. ==Taxonomy== The family was first described in 1931 by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble (1894â€“1940). * Genus Sooglossus (Seychelles frogs) ** Gardiner's Seychelles frog (S. gardineri) ** Seychelles palm frog (S. pipilodryas) ** Seychelles frog (S. sechellensis) ** Thomasset's frog (S. thomasseti) * Genus Nasikabatrachus (purple frog) ** Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
