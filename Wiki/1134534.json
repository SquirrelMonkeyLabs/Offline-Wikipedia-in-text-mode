It is a member of the Magnificent Seven, a group of neutron stars that are relatively near to the Solar System. RX J0720.4–3125 has a radius of around 5 km. Its temperature and color has been changing strangely over several years. It is hard to know why these changes are happening, but it could be that there was something happening, like the star absorbing an accretion disc. ==References== Category:Stars",
