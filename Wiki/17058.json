There are different kinds of bands that use different groups of instruments. ==Types of bands== *A rock band is usually a group of 4 people with 1 or 2 electric guitars, a bass guitar, a drum kit and a singer. Some rock bands have only 3 members, like Rush. *A brass band is a group of about 20 - 30 people with brass instruments and drums. *A concert band is a large group of 20 - 60 people with woodwind instruments, brass instruments, drums and percussion instruments. *A marching band has similar instruments to the concert band. Instead of sitting down to play, they march in parades or at American football matches. *A folk band uses traditional styles of music from around the world. It can include a guitar, violin, tin whistle, flute, accordion, lagerphone and tea chest bass, and many other makeshift instruments. A lagerphone is a percussion instrument which uses bottle tops to make a sound.
