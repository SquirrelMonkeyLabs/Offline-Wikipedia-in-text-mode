 "text": "The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romantic adventure drama movie. It was directed by Randal Kleiser and filmed on Turtle Island Fiji.Filming of The Blue Lagoon The screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart was based on the novel The Blue Lagoon by Henry De Vere Stacpoole. The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The movie is a remake of the 1949 movie of the same name. There was also a 1923 silent movie version of the Blue Lagoon directed by W. Bowden. It is about a boy and girl who are cousins. After escaping a fire at sea they are stranded on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean. They are left to survive on their own. The two children learn to live off the island's natural resources. As they become teenagers, the two fall in love. Roger Ebert called it the \"dumbest movie of the year\". The nude scenes by then 14-year-old Brooke Shields were artfully covered by gluing her hair to her chest and using body doubles. Rona Barrett, a gossip columnist, compared the movie to child pornography. Reviewers were more impressed by the scenery in Fiji than the movie's plot. Janet Maslin of the New York Times said neither Atkins or Shields did much acting. The movie was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Christopher Atkins received a Golden Globe nomination for New Star of the Year. It was followed by Return to the Blue Lagoon. == References == Category:1980 adventure movies Category:1980s coming-of-age movies Category:1980 romantic drama movies Category:1980s teen drama movies Category:1980s teen romance movies Category:American adventure movies Category:American coming-of-age movies Category:American movie remakes Category:American romantic drama movies Category:Coming-of-age drama movies Category:Coming-of-age romance movies Category:1980s English-language movies Category:Incest in movies Category:Movies set in the 19th century Category:Movies set on beaches Category:Movies set on islands Category:Movies set underwater Category:Teenage pregnancy in movies Category:Works about cousins Category:Movies directed by Randal Kleiser Category:Columbia Pictures movies",
