 "text": "Many religions teach about peace, kindness, and spiritual growth. Some religious groups and individuals believe that politics is not good for their faith. They think politics is full of corruption, lies, and power struggles, which can take people away from their religious values. This is called the religious rejection of politics. == Reasons for rejecting politics == * Focus on Spiritual Life – Many religious people believe that politics is worldly, while faith is about the soul. They think focusing on God and moral values is more important than being involved in government or political debates. * Avoiding Corruption – Politics often involves competition, dishonesty, and personal gain. Some religious groups reject politics because they do not want to be part of corruption or unethical behavior. * Separation of Religion and Government – Some faiths believe that religion and politics should be separate. They do not want religious leaders to have political power or governments to control religion. * Seeking Peace – Political conflicts often lead to arguments, divisions, and even wars. Many religious people prefer to stay away from politics to focus on peace and unity. * Trusting in a Higher Power – Some religious groups believe that God, not human leaders, is in control. They think prayer and faith are more powerful than voting or political action. == Challenges of avoiding politics == While rejecting politics can help people stay true to their faith, it can also bring difficulties. Governments make laws that affect everyone, including religious people. If religious groups do not participate, they may have no influence on important issues like religious freedom, education, and justice. Some argue that faith should inspire people to make the world better, including through political action. == Religious groups that reject participation in politics == Religion Adherents Largest national membership Jehovah's Witnesses 8,200,000 United States Baháʼí Faith 6,000,000 India Rastafarians 600,000 Jamaica Old Order Amish 318,000 United States Hellenism 120,000 Greece Shaykhiya 100,000 Iraq Christadelphians 50,000 Australia Exclusive Brethren 40,000 Australia Doukhobors 3,000 Canada Purist Salafis — Saudi Arabia Tablighi Jamaat — India Nurcu — Turkey Rejection of politics, religious",
