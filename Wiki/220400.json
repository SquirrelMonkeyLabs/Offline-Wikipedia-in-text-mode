Even though these are Interstate Highways, most of them are not grade separated, which means drivers must use a specially made group of ramps to get to the road. They mostly are along roads with two lanes. Also, there are no signs for these Interstate Highways. The four Interstate Highways in Alaska are: *Interstate A1 goes from Anchorage to the Canada border. It is long.Route Log - Main Routes of the Eisenhower National System Of Interstate and Defense Highways - Table 1 *Interstate A2 goes from Tok to Fairbanks.
