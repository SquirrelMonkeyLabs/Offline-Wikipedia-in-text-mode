She was the second skier to finish in the women's visually impaired Super-G race, Giant slalom race and Super Combined race, and the third skier to finish the women's visually impaired downhill race and slalom race. Because she cannot see, Evgenia Kolosovskaya was her guide and told her where to go when going down the mountain. ==References== Category:Russian sportspeople with disabilities Category:Skiers Category:Living people Category:1987 births",
