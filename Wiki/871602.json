 "text": "Pithecopus gonzagai is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives several states north of the Rio SÃ£o Francisco. This frog lives in trees in grasslands and shrublands. People have heard it calling near ponds that dry up for part of the year. The female frog lays eggs on leaves that hang over the water. The tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch. People have also seen it in watering holes, places where cows and other animals drink water. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
