It lives in forests that are not too high up in the mountains. People have seen this frog between 180 and 700 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs in dead leaves on the ground She lays 4-9 eggs at a time. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries them to pools of water inside holes in trees or in the plant Dieffenbachia. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because people cut down trees to make farms and because people catch this frog to sell as a pet.
