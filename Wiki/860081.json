 "text": "Pachyrhizus erosus is a plant form the pea family (Fabaceae) that originally grew in Mexico. In English, it is commonly known as jícama, Mexican yam bean, or Mexican turnip. The name can refer both to the plant (which is a vine) and its seeds. Even though it originally grew in Mexico, it was already found in Peru, more than 3.000 years ago. The Spanish introduced it to Asia in the 17th century. == Description == The jícama vine can grow up to a height of 4-5 meters (13-16 feet). Its root can grow up to 2 m (6.5 ft) of length and weigh up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds).
