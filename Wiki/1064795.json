 "text": "The Balinese saka calendar is a Lunar calendar used by the Balinese people. It is one of two calendars used in Bali, Indonesia. Unlike the other 210-day Pawukon calendar, it follows the phases of the Moon and is almost as long as the solar year of the Gregorian calendar. The saka year has twelve months called 'sasih' in Balinese, each with 30 days. However, since the lunar cycle is a bit shorter than 30 days and the lunar year is 354 or 355 days long, the calendar is adjusted to stay in sync with the lunar and solar cycles. The Balinese Hindu festival Nyepi, also called the day of silence, signals the beginning of the Saka year. On Tilem Kepitu, the last day of the 7th month, there is Siva Ratri, a night dedicated to the god Shiva. People who follow this tradition stay awake all night and meditate. Throughout the Saka year, there are 24 more ceremonial days, usually celebrated during Purnama. == Months == Following are the 12 months of the Balinese Saka calendar:Esimeman (1989) pp186-190 No. Name 1 Kasa 2 Karo 3 Katiga 4 Kapat 5 Kalima 6 Kanem 7 Kapitu 8 Kawalu 9 Kasanga 10 Kadasa 11 Jyestha 12 Sada == Related pages == *Bali *Balinese language == References == Category:Calendars Calendar",
