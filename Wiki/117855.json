 "text": "Sturgeon is the common name for 28 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae. The family has four extant genera: Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus, and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. Some species of sturgeon (for example, the beluga), are harvested for their valuable caviar. == Description == Sturgeons are known for their long body, which contains dozens of plates called scutes. They have a sharp snout and a heterocercal tail. == Evolution == Sturgeons have been referred to as \"living fossils\" or \"primitive fish\" because their features have not changed very much since their earliest fossil record. === History === Acipenseriformes first appeared 174–201 mya. Then, the \"true\" sturgeons appeared in the Upper Cretaceous. === Taxonomy === Family Acipenseridae (sturgeons) * Genus Acipenser Linnaeus, 1758 ** †Acipenser albertensis Lambe 1902 > ** Acipenser baerii J.

In North America, they range along the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of Mexico to Newfoundland. They used to be found throughout the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Hudson River. Throughout this extensive range, almost all species are highly threatened or vulnerable to extinction due to a combination of habitat destruction, overfishing, and pollution.Sturgeon more critically endangered than any other group of species. IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the last century, this large fish was often regarded as a nuisance because it often became entangled in and caused commercial fishing nets to become ripped. Only much later did the sturgeon become prized for its meat, eggs (caviar) and oil. Gelatin from the inner lining of its air bladder was used to make isinglass–a substance used as a clarifying agent in jellies, glues and in the isinglass windows of carriages and early cars. Nowadays, the lake sturgeon's dark form can be sometimes be discerned in reedy shallows or near river mouths. == Gallery == File:Acipenser fulvescens GLERL.jpg|Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) File:Scaphirhynchus albus (Pallid sturgeon) FWS 23610.jpg|Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) File:Acipenser baerii.jpg|Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) == References == == Other websites == * Acipenser on the FishBase website * https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181871 Category:Edible fish Category:Living fossils",
