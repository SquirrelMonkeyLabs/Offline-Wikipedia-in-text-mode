 "text": "Lance Kurtis McNaught (March 2, 1981 â€“ August 13, 2010) was an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his time working for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), where he wrestled under the ring names Garrison Cade and Lance Cade. Cade was trained by Shawn Michaels and made his professional wrestling debut along with Bryan Danielson in 1999 for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) in Japan. Cade signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001 and began working for their developmental territory Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW). In the summer, he was sent to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA). When the WWF dropped HWA as their developmental territory, Cade moved the then-renamed WWE's main developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). In 2003, he debuted on an episode of Sunday Night Heat in a match against Lance Storm who forced him to submit to the sharpshooter. During his WWE career, he was known to team with Mark Jindrak and then later Trevor Murdoch. Cade was released from the company on October 14, 2008. Jim Ross stated on his blog that Cade \"made a major league mistake while utilizing bad judgment\" and that it was a factor in his departure. Ross also mentioned Cade having a seizure on a plane and him needing emergency medical care as a part of this. He was a three-time World Tag Team Champion with Trevor Murdoch. On August 13, 2010, Cade died at the age of 29 of apparent heart failure in San Antonio, Texas. On October 13, the medical examiner in San Antonio ruled that his death was \"accidental,\" and stated that intoxication from mixed drugs complicated a cardiomyopathy and caused his death. ==Championships== *Heartland Wrestling Association **HWA Heavyweight Championship (2 times) **HWA Tag Team Championship (3 times) (with Steve Bradley (2) and Mike Sanders (1)) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **He was ranked #80 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the \"PWI 500\" in 2008. *Texas Wrestling Alliance **TWA Television Championship (1 time) *World Wrestling Entertainment **World Tag Team Championship (3 times) (with Trevor Murdoch) == References == ==Other websites== *WWE profile Category:1981 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Deaths from cardiomyopathy Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Deaths from heart failure Category:Drug- related deaths in the United States Category:Former WWE wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from Omaha, Nebraska",
