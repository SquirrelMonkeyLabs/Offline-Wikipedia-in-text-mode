 "text": "A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and converts it into a 'signal' which can be read by an observer or by an instrument. For example, a mercury thermometer converts the measured temperature into the expansion and contraction of a liquid which can be read on a calibrated glass tube. Video cameras and a digital cameras have an image sensor. There are many different types of sensors. Some are used in everyday objects, and some are separate. == Thermal sensors == A sensor that detects temperature. Thermal sensors are in many laptops and computers in order to sound an alarm when a certain temperature has been exceeded. * temperature sensors: thermometers, thermostats * heat sensors: bolometer, calorimeter == Electromagnetic sensors == An electronic device used to measure a physical quantity such as pressure or loudness and convert it into an electronic signal of some kind (e.g. a voltage). * electrical resistance sensors: ohmmeter * electrical voltage sensors: voltmeter * electrical power sensors: watt-hour meter * magnetism sensors: magnetic compass * metal detectors * Radar An electromagnetic sensor is anything that can detect things like photons, electrons, magnetic fields etc. It can be as simple as a white wall, a sheet of white paper, etc., or as new as a charge-coupled device. When a laser is aimed at a detection screen, a bright spot can be seen on the screen, or when an electron hits the phosphors on another kind of screen, it makes that screen glow. == Mechanical sensors == * Pressure sensors: barometer * Vibration and shock sensors == Motion sensors == A motion sensor detects physical movement in a given area. * Radar gun, tachometer * Speedometer == Car sensors == * reversing sensor * curb feeler Category:Tools Category:Computer hardware Category:Data input",
