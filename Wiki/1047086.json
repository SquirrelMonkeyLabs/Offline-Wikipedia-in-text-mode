 "text": "The Naduvattam Bush Frog or Ravi's bush frog (Raorchestes ravii) is a frog. It lives in India. The first scientists to write about this frog saw it on a tea farm. Since then, people have seen this frog between 1890 and 2,284 meters above sea level in grassland and shola forest. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog, like other frogs in Raorchestes do. People think this frog might also live in Mukurthi National Park. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
