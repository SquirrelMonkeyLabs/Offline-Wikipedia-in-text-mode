 "text": "Nicoya is a town in Costa Rica's Guanacaste Province. It is one of the most important tourist zones. It serves as a transport hub to Guanacaste's beaches and national parks. The town is also the capital of the cantón of the same name (Nicoya Canton). The town was built in an old colonial style. It was built in the Cordillera Volcánica de Guanacaste. Agriculture and cattle are the town's main economic activity. In early 2006, a group of researchers led by adventure writer Dan Buettner and supported by National Geographic Magazine, the National Institute for Aging, and Alliance Healthcare, designated Nicoya as a Blue Zone. This designation is granted to global regions that are characterized by the longest life expectancies. Among the ideal Nicoyan lifestyle characteristics cited by the research were the water’s high calcium content, intense daily physical activity, year-long fruit consumption, and close inter-generational relationships. While the town elected 61 year old Lorenzo Rosales Vargas as mayor on December 3, 2006 he was only able to serve for about a year before quitting due to health reasons. Since May 5, 2008 Eduardo Gutiérrez Rosales has been holding the office instead as Nicoya's first supply mayor. They are both members of the National Liberation Party (PLN). ==References== Category:Cities in Costa Rica Category:Guanacaste Province Category:1520s establishments in North America Category:Establishments in Costa Rica",
