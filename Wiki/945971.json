[Someone] that just goes through the cycle constantly. Most gangstas' actions are for finances -- they're motivated by money, the root of all evil -- but how are you gangsta and you're not getting any money? You're going back and forth to jail. And you're telling stories like, yeah I'm gonna get this [BMW]. And then we see you at the car lot, and you're there looking at the [BMW], and you still don't get it.\" Eminem released a remix as diss song on Ja Rule on his 2004 box set The Singles. ==References== ==Other websites== *\"Wanksta\" on YouTube Category:2002 songs Category:50 Cent songs Category:Diss tracks Category:Hip hop songs",
