 "text": "A great power is a nation or state that is able to influence other states in most of the world. That is possible because it has great economic, political and military strength. It is not as powerful as a superpower or hyperpower. Its opinions are taken into account by other nations before taking diplomatic or military action. Characteristically, they have the ability to intervene militarily almost anywhere. They also have soft, cultural power, and often economic investment in less developed countries.
