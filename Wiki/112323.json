 "text": "Norman \"Normie\" Smith (March 18, 1908 in Toronto – February 2, 1988) was a Vezina-winning goaltender for the Detroit Red Wings. Smith did not let in a goal by the Montreal Maroons in the NHL's longest game, a 176-minute, 30-second game, on way to a Stanley Cup championship in 1936. After suffering an arm injury, his quality of play dropped in 1937–38 and the Red Wings finished last. During a game in 1939, he did not show up, causing problems with Jack Adams. Normie Smith retired rather than report to the minor leagues. He returned to play briefly with the Detroit Red Wings when World War II left a vacuum of players in the NHL. ==Other websites== *Normie Smith biography * Category:1908 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Detroit Falcons players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Ice hockey people from Toronto Category:Montreal Maroons players Category:Pittsburgh Hornets players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Vezina Trophy winners",
