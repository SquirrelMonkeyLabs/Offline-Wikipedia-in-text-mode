 "text": "The Ceratobatrachidae are a family of frogs. They live in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, the Philippines, Palau, Fiji, New Guinea, and the Admiralty, Bismarck, and Solomon Islands. ==Taxonomy== Scientists used to think of Ceratobatrachidae as a subfamily (i.e., Ceratobatrachinae) in the family Ranidae (true frogs), but now they call it a separate family. The following genera are in Ceratobatrachidae: * Subfamily Alcalinae Brown, Siler, Richards, Diesmos, and Cannatella, 2015 ** Alcalus (5 species) * Subfamily Ceratobatrachinae Boulenger, 1884 **Cornufer Tschudi, 1838 (> 50 species) **Platymantis GÃ¼nther, 1858 (> 30 species) * Subfamily Liuraninae Fei, Ye, and Jiang, 2010 **Liurana Dubois, 1987 (4 species) Some other genera used to be in Ceratobatrachidae, but scientists now think the frogs that used to be in these genera should be in the genera above. *Batrachylodes Boulenger, 1887 (8 species) *Palmatorappia Ahl, 1927 (1 species) *Ceratobatrachus Boulenger, 1884 (1 species) *Discodeles Boulenger, 1918 (5 species) ==Distribution== Ceratobatrachidae live across Island Southeast Asia, as well as in the Eastern Himalayas. ;Genus Liurana *Eastern Himalayas: 4 species ;Genus Alcalus *Borneo: 2 species (Alcalus baluensis and Alcalus rajae) *Palawan: 1 species (Alcalus mariae) ;Genus Platymantis *Philippines: ;Genus Cornufer *Palau: 1 species *Maluku: 3-4 species *New Guinea: 6-8 species *Bismarck Archipelago: 18-22 species *Solomon Islands: 20-25 species *Fiji: 2 species ==Life history== All Ceratobatrachidae lay eggs outside of water and undergo direct development. That means the eggs hatch into small frogs and are never tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
