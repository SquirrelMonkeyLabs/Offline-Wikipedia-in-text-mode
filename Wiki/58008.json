 "text": "A birth name is the family name someone has when he or she is born, or at least from the time he or she is a child. This term can be used by a man or a woman who changes a name later in life for any reason. A maiden name is the family name—usually the birth name—a woman has before she marries. A married name is the family name taken by a married person at the time of the marriage. The most common example is when a woman takes the family name of her spouse at the time of marriage, but sometimes a man changes his name at marriage. Also, sometimes both people change their names, such as to a hyphenated or other mixed name. Sometimes the words \"né\" (for a man) or \"née\" (for a woman) are used to show a birth name or maiden name. These words mean \"born\", and are borrowedv.2 from French. Category:Names",
