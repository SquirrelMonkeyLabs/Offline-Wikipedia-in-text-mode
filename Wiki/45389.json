 "text": "A canoe is a small boat, that is often driven by manpower or womanpower, but also commonly sailed. Canoes are pointed at both ends and usually open on top, but can be covered. Canoes are known as \"Paddle boats\" in some small towns in the south of Australia. The canoe is propelled by the use of paddles, with the number of paddlers depending on the size of the canoe (most commonly 2). Paddlers face in the direction of travel, either seated or kneeling. In this way paddling a canoe can be contrasted with rowing, where the rowers face away from the direction of travel. Paddles may be single-bladed or double-bladed. == Gallery == Image:Canoe 8179.jpg|Aluminum canoe, Upper Klamath Lake Image:Dugout canoe Rennell.jpg|A dugout canoe of pirogue type in the Solomon Islands Image:PaulKane-HuntingFish-ROM.jpg|Spearing Salmon By Torchlight, an oil painting by Paul Kane Image:Pf026012.jpg|Ojibway women in canoe on Leech Lake. ==Related pages== *Canoe racing == Other websites == * International Canoe Federation Homepage * Canadian Canoe Museum * Wooden Canoe Heritage Association * Canoe Category:Boats",
