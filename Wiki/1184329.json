 "text": "Anomaloglossus apiau is a frog. Scientists found it in Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in forests on mountains. Scientists saw it about between 500 and 1400 meters above sea level. It lives near streams. People have seen this frog in Parque Nacional da Serra da Mocidade. ==Young== Scientists think these frogs have young in the same way as other frogs in Anomaloglossus: The female lays eggs on leaves, and the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger. People build towns and other places to live in the Serro do Apiau near where the frog lives. Then people collect wood from the forests and sometimes set fires. Climate change could hurt this frog because it lives high up in the hills, so it could not move somewhere else if the weather became too hot or too dry. Scientists also think that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could kill these frogs. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
