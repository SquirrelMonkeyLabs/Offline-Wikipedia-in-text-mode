 "text": "\"Like a G6\" is the first single from American musical group Far East Movement's third studio album Free Wired. The song was released on April 13, 2010. The song features The Cataracs and singer/rapper Dev. The song chorus features a sample from Dev's song \"Booty Bounce\". \"Like a G6\" was number 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks and ended on November 6, 2010. The song was number 1 again for the week of November 27 in the same year. The \"G6\" in the song \"Booty Bounce\" was sampled in \"Like a G6\". The song was put into the lyrics after the producers of the song were trying to look for a rhyme for the line \"Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6\". The producers decided to choose \"G6\", which is meant to be a reference to the private airplane model Gulfstream IV. According to Far East Movement member Kev Nish, they decided that a G6 was \"flyer than a G4\". ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:2010 songs",
