A major Xia city was Khara-Khoto. The Mongols took Western Xia in 1227. Most of its records and architecture were destroyed. Historians did not know much about the dynasty until the 20th-century. Today the Tangut language and its script are extinct. There is not much Tangut literature left. The Western Xia was in the area of the Hexi Corridor. The Hexi Corridor was a part of the Silk Road, which was an important trade route from northern China and Central Asia.Zhao, Yanlong [赵彦龙] (2005). \"Qian tan xi xia gong wen wen feng yu gong wen zai ti [A brief discussion on the writing style in official documents and documental carrier] 浅谈西夏公文文风与公文载体.\" Xibei min zu yan jiu [Northwest Nationalities Research] 西北民族研究 45(2): 78-84.Qin, Wenzhong [秦文忠], Zhou Haitao [周海涛] and Qin Ling [秦岭] (1998). \"Xixia jun shi ti yu yu ke xue ji shu [The military sports, science and technology of West Xia] 西夏军事体育与科学技术.\" Ningxia Daxue Xuebao [Journal of Ningxia University] 《宁夏大学学报》 79 (2): 48-50. == Rulers == Temple Name Posthumous Name Personal Name Reign Dates Jǐngzōng Emperor Wǔliè Lǐ Yuánhào 1038–1048 Yìzōng Emperor Zhāoyīng Lǐ Liàngzuò 1048–1067 Huìzōng Emperor Kāngjìng Lǐ Bǐngcháng 1067–1086 Chóngzōng Emperor Shèngwén Lǐ Qiánshùn 1086–1139 Rénzōng Emperor Shèngdé Lǐ Rénxiào 1139–1193 Huánzōng Emperor Zhāojiǎn Lǐ Chúnyòu 1193–1206 Xiāngzōng Emperor Jìngmù Lǐ Ānquán 1206–1211 Shénzōng Emperor Yīngwén Lǐ Zūnxū 1211–1223 Xiànzōng None Lǐ Déwàng 1223–1226 None None Lǐ Xiàn 1226–1227 Emperor Era Name Dates Jǐngzōng Tiānshòu Lǐfǎ Yánzuò 天授禮法延祚 1038–1048 Yìzōng Yánsì Níngguó 延嗣寧國 1049 Yìzōng Tiānyòu Chuíshèng 天祐垂聖 1050–1052 Yìzōng Fúshèng Chéngdào 福聖承道 (Tangut or ) 1053–1056 Yìzōng Duǒdū 奲都 1057–1062 Gǒnghuà 拱化 1063–1067 Huìzōng Qiándào 乾道 1068–1069 Huìzōng Tiāncì Lǐshèng Guóqìng 天賜禮盛國慶 (Tangut ) 1070–1074 Huìzōng Dà'ān 大安 (Tangut ) 1075–1085 Huìzōng Tiān'ān Lǐdìng 天安禮定 (Tangut ) 1086 Chóngzōng Tiānyí Zhìpíng 天儀治平 (Tangut ) 1086–1089 Chóngzōng Tiānyòu Mín'ān 天祐民安 (Tangut ) 1090–1097 Chóngzōng Yǒng'ān 永安 (Tangut ) 1098–1100 Chóngzōng Zhēnguān 貞觀 (Tangut ) 1101–1113 Chóngzōng Yōngníng 雍寧 (Tangut ) 1114–1118 Chóngzōng Yuándé 元德 (Tangut ) 1119–1127 Chóngzōng Zhèngdé 正德 (Tangut ) 1127–1134 Chóngzōng Dàdé 大德 (Tangut ) 1135–1139 Rénzōng Daqing 大慶 (Tangut ) 1140–1143 Rénzōng Rénqìng 人慶 (Tangut ) 1144–1148 Rénzōng Tiānshèng 天盛 (Tangut ) 1149–1169 Rénzōng Qiányòu 乾祐 (Tangut ) 1170–1193 Huánzōng Tiānqìng 天慶 (Tangut ) 1194–1206 Xiāngzōng Yìngtiān 應天 1206–1209 Xiāngzōng Huángjiàn 皇建 (Tangut ) 1210–1211 Shénzōng Guāngdìng 光定 (Tangut ) 1211–1223 Xiànzōng Qiándìng 乾定 1223–1226 Lǐ Xiàn Bǎoqìng 寶慶 1226–1227 == Administrative divisions == Region Prefecture Modern location Hexi Xingzhou (Xingqing, Ducheng) Yinchuan Hexi Dingzhou Pingluo County Hexi Huaizhou East of Yinchuan Hexi Yongzhou Yongning County Hexi Liangzhou (Xiliangfu) Wuwei Hexi Ganzhou (Xuanhuafu) Zhangye Hexi Suzhou Jiuquan Hexi Guazhou Guazhou County Hexi Shazhou Dunhuang Henan Lingzhou Northwest of Wuzhong Henan Hongzhou Southwest of Jingbian Henan Youzhou Otog Front Banner Henan Yinzhou East of Hengshan Henan Xiazhou North of Jingbian Henan Shizhou Hengshan Henan Yanzhou Dingbian County Henan Nanweizhou Tongxin County Henan Huizhou Jingyuan Other Xiningzhou Xining Other Lezhou South of Ledu Other Kuozhou Southwest of Hualong Other Jishizhou Xunhua Salar Autonomous County == Related pages == *History of China == References == === Citations === === Sources === * . * * * (alk. paper) * * * * * (paperback). * * * * * * . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Other websites == * 宁夏新闻网 (Ningxia News Web): 西夏研究 (Xixia Research). * 宁夏新闻网 (Ningxia News Web): 文化频道 (Cultural Channel).
