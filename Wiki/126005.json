 "text": "Abstraction is the process of leaving out certain details of an idea or a concept to make it more general. The word abstract has the following connections: *Abstract art does not try to represent the physical world as it is. * Abstract ideas such as \"democracy\" are concepts. Unlike houses and books (which are objects) they cannot be touched. Other examples of abstract ideas are speed, rarity and courage. * In logic, if something is abstract, it is general. * Abstract algebra compares different kinds of algebra. * An abstract in writing is a short summary of a paper or essay that tells the reader the main points. Such summaries or abstracts are common in articles published in scientific journals.",
