 "text": "Litoria chloristona is a frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it near the Kikori River, from sea level to 500 meters above sea level. They also saw it in Port Essington, Australia. The adult male frog is about 19.6 to 23.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female is 23.7 to 27.4 mm long. It has large eyes and a pointy nose. Its back is bright green and can have bronze on its sides. The female frog lays eggs in water that does not move. The eggs float to the surface of the water. The tadpoles have wide fins on their backs and narrow fins on their bellies. They have bands of color. The name chloristona comes from the Greek words chloros for \"green,\" elaschistos for \"small,\" and ontos for \"living thing.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
