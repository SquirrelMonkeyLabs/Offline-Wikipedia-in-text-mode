 "text": "An axiomatic system in mathematics and logic is a set of axioms or primitive notions from which theorems are logically derived. A system is usually part of a formal theory, which is a collection of sentences closed under logical implication. == Properties == * Consistency: An axiomatic system is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. Inconsistent systems allow for any statement to be proven (principle of explosion). * Independence: An axiom is independent if it cannot be proven using the other axioms of the system. A system is independent if all its axioms are independent. * Completeness: A system is complete if every statement can either be proven true or false using the axioms. == Models == A model provides interpretations of the undefined terms in an axiomatic system and proves the system's consistency. Models can be concrete (with real-world objects) or abstract (based on other axiomatic systems). == Relative consistency == Relative consistency refers to the ability to define the undefined terms of one system within another, such that the axioms of the first system become theorems of the second. == Related pages == * Mathematical logic == References == Category:Mathematics",
