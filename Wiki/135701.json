 "text": "\"I Kissed a Girl\" is the first single by pop singer Katy Perry from her album One of the Boys (2008), produced by Dr. Luke. On June 26, 2008, the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the 1000th chart-topper of the Rock Era. The song is a major worldwide hit, and along with the United States it has topped the charts in more than 20 countries, including Canada, Sweden, Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and Ireland. == Inspiration == Perry said the song is \"about the magical beauty of a woman.\"\"Katy Perry's 'I Kissed A Girl' Is The Most Buzzed About Hit Of The Summer\" , StarPulse.com. 2008-06-13 09:00:00. Retrieved June 27, 2008. Perry told Steppin' Out magazine: \"'I Kissed a Girl' was inspired when I opened up a magazine and I saw a picture of Scarlett Johansson ... I was with my boyfriend at the time, and I said to him, 'I'm not going to lie: If Scarlett Johansson walked into the room and wanted to make out with me, I would make out with her. I hope you’re okay with that?'\" == Music video == A music video for the song was released on May 16, 2008, on Perry's personal website and on MySpace. The video was directed by Kinga Burza and features a Moulin Rouge and burlesque-type setting with scenes containing Katy, along with many other flamboyantly-dressed women, including Ke$ha, dancing to the song. Eventually she wakes up next to a male companion. Despite the song's name, there is not any same-sex kissing in the video. Katy features her real life friend and DJ, Mia Moretti and her main gay, Markus Molinari's dog Bella in the video. Even her cat, Kitty Purry, makes an appearance. The video made its television debut on June 12 on TRL with the visit and interview by Perry in set show. And on June 24, 2008 it became #1 on TRL. The video was played many times on this music video channel, as well as on VH1. It launched at #20 on VH1's VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown on June 28, 2008.

The video received five nominations for the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video and Best New Artist. The video has had over 24 million views on YouTube. Due to the video and the songs popularity around the world, there are several videos on YouTube which imitate and mock the song such as \"I Kissed a Pig\" and \"I Kissed a Dog\", both of which use the same tune and similar lyrics, while the videos use similar scenes to the original. == Critical reception == \"I Kissed a Girl\" has drawn mixed reviews from critics.

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote, Perry's \"lead single 'I Kissed a Girl' features a throbbing beat and an infectious, bi-curious hook, but its self-satisfied, in-your-face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of 'Justify My Love' or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFranco's catalogue; it's like a tween version of DiFranco's tortured bisexual confession 'Light of Some Kind.'\"Cinquemani, Sal (2008). \"Katy Perry - One of the Boys\" review, Slant Magazine.

In addition it had received at least one play a week on BBC Radio 2 on its Saturday evening America’s Greatest Hits show hosted by Paul Gambaccini due to the song’s number status in the Billboard chart. == Controversy == The song gained a significant amount of controversy after its rise in popularity due to its perceived promotion of bisexuality and promiscuity. While community members and parents may be concerned over \"the coarseness of the sexual behavior,\" including its public nature and intoxicated state, they may or, such as Unitarian minister Debra W. Haffner, may not be concerned over \"the sex or gender of the person she's talking about.\" While Haffner, who holds a degree in public health, believes Perry \"obviously is using the whole issue of sexual orientation in a positive way, raising awareness, or she's doing it because it gets attention,\" AllMusic concludes that, \"the problem is not with Katy's gender-bending, it's that her heart isn't in it; she's just using it to get her places, so she sinks to crass, craven depths.\" Slant Magazine agrees, saying, the song, \"isn't problematic because it promotes homosexuality, but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention—both from Perry's boyfriend and her audience.\" Adam Holz of PluggedinOnline, a division of Focus on the Family, wrote an article entitled \"A Tale of Two Katys\"Holz, Adam (2008). Up Front: \"A Tale of Two Katys\" , PluggedinOnline.com. Tuesday, July 7, 2008. about the singer's image transformation from a Contemporary Christian Music artiste to one of the \"girls gone wild\". He criticizes the song for being the latest, \"high-profile message to young women and men that our sexuality is a malleable commodity that can be reshaped at will.\" Holz also argues that Perry's message carries with it, \"no need to worry about who might get used or objectified in the process,\" causing Katy to live, \"down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype.\" In some areas of the world the song's bi-curious lyrics have kept it from reaching the Top 40 or to even be released at all.
