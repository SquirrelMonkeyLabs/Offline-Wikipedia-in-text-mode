These are the only muscles in the human body that can extend the knee. ==Structure== ===Parts=== The Quadriceps are divided into four different muscles, also called the 'heads' * The rectus femoris muscle is located in the middle of the thigh, covering most of the other three quadriceps muscles. It originates from the hip bone. It is named for its straight course. * The vastus lateralis muscle is on the outer side of the thigh. * The vastus medialis muscle is on the inner part of the thigh. * The vastus intermedius muscle lies between vastus lateralis and vastus medialis on the front of the femur, but deeper than the rectus femoris muscle. ==References== Category:Muscles",
