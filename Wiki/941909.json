London: Souvenir Press, p. 74. In the preface to this play Racine writes: \"All creativity consists in making something out of nothing\". Beckett was a keen scholar of the 17th-century playwright, and lectured on him at Trinity College Dublin. *The title character of Balzac's 1851 play Mercadet waits for financial salvation from his never-seen business partner, Godeau. Although Beckett was familiar with Balzac's prose, he insisted that he learned of the play after finishing Waiting for Godot. *The protagonists in Beckett's novel Mercier and Camier may be the prototypes of Vladimir and Estragon. \"If you want to find the origins of Godot\", he told Colin Duckworth once, \"look at Murphy\".Cooke V.
