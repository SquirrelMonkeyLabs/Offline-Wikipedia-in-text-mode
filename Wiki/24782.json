 "text": "A jerboa is a small desert rodent of Asia and Northern Africa.Burton, Maurice; Burton, Robert (1970). The International Wildlife Encyclopedia. Marshall Cavendish. p. 1323. . It looks like a mouse, but it has a long tail and very long back legs. The jerboa moves by jumping, and their highest jump is over 6 feet high. They have long tails, long hind legs, and short front legs. There are 33 species of jerboa, which tend to live in hot deserts. When they are being chased, jerboas can run up to 24 kilometers per hour. Some jerboa species are preyed on by little owls in central Asia. Most species of jerboas have very good hearing. Their hearing helps them avoid being attacked by predators. == Related pages == * Hopping mouse * Jumping mouse * Kangaroo rat and kangaroo mouse * Kultarr * Springhare == References == Category:Rodents Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Mammals of Africa Category:Mammals of Asia",
