During the 1990s, De'ath served prison sentences for a theft. On 11 November 2012, De'ath was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree in an alleged connection with the Jimmy Savileâ€“BBC sex scandal; he was later released without charge after the complainant withdrew her statement. De'ath was later told that he would not face any charges, and said that the police action had been \"overzealous\".
