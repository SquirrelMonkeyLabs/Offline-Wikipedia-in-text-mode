 "text": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) () is an independent group. It was created by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act in 2001. The BTRC controls all things related to telecommunications in Bangladesh, like phone lines, cell phones, satellites, and cable. The leader of the BTRC is like a judge of the Bangladesh High Court. == History == In 1979, the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board was created by an ordinance. This ordinance was revised in 1995. The BTRC started on 31 January 2002. Its goal was to make telecommunication services affordable and to increase the number of telephones to at least 10 per 100 people by 2010. This was amended in 2010 with a new Telecommunication Act. In 2016, the Bangladesh government increased the salaries of the commission members and chairman twice. === Censorship === In March 2013, Human Rights Watch and others criticised the BTRC for blocking access to some websites of \"atheist bloggers.\" One of the blocked blogs belonged to Asif Mohiuddin, who had been attacked in January. The following month, Mohiuddin was arrested along with three other bloggers. == Chairmen == Sl No. Name Term Start Term End Reference 1\\. Syed Margub Murshed 31 January 2002 30 January 2005 2\\.
