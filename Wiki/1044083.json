 "text": "The mata mata (Chelus fimbriata), also known as the matamata, is a type of freshwater turtle that lives in South America. It is one of two species in the genus Chelus, the other being Chelus orinocensis. == Description == The mata mata is a large turtle with a flat head that is shaped like a triangle. It has many tubercles. The shell looks like a piece of bark, and its head looks like a leaf. == As pets == Mata mata turtles can be kept as pets. Mata matas, however, are not active hunters and like the alligator snapping turtle, they need less space than a large, active species. == References == # Giant fossil matamata turtles (matamatas part V) Archived 2011-10-11 at the Wayback Machine, Tetrapod Zoology # Matamata, Chelus fimbriatus, California Turtle & Tortoise Club Category:IUCN Red List least concern species Category:Turtles Category:Reptiles of South America Category:Animals of South America",
