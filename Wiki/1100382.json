 "text": "The Great (titled onscreen as The Great: An Occasionally True Story and in one episode as The Great: An Almost Entirely Untrue Story) is an alternate historical and satirical comedy-drama television series. It is very loosely based on the rise to power of Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. It stars Elle Fanning as Catherine and Nicholas Hoult as Emperor Peter III and Peter's body double Yemelyan Pugachev. The series has been called \"anti-historical\" by Hulu as it does not focus on being historically correct. All ten episodes of the first season were released on Hulu on May 15, 2020. In July 2020, it was renewed for a second season which premiered on November 19, 2021. In January 2022, the series was renewed for a third season which premiered on May 12, 2023. In August 2023, Hulu announced the series's third season had been its last. ==References== Category:Hulu original series Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2023 American television series endings Category:Satirical television series Category:Comedy-drama television series Category:Television series about marriage Category:2020s British television series debuts Category:2020s British television series endings Category:English-language television programs",
