 "text": "The Allobates magnussoni is a frog. It lives in Brazil. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.09 - 19.59 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult frog is 17.97 - 20.84 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is usually brown, like the dead leaves on the ground. This helps the frog hide. There is a mark in the shape of an hourglass on the frog's back. Most frogs have a stripe on each side of the body. The tops of all four legs are brown too, with darker brown marks. The male frog has a gray-violet throat and chest. The male frog has a white belly with some yellow color near the back and sides. The female frog's belly is all yellow. ==Home== This frog lives in forests. Scientists saw the frog 132 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in some protected places, for example Parque Nacional da Amazonia, Estação Ecológica da Terra do Meio, and Reserva Extrativista Tapajós-Arapiuns. They think it might live in Floresta Nacional do Tapajós too. ==Young== The male frog has one sound he makes to tell other frogs he is there and another to tell other male frogs that this place is his. The male frog makes a nest out of folded leaves in the dead leaves on the ground. The female frog decides which male frog to go to. After the eggs hatch, the male and female adult frogs carry the tadpoles to streams, where they swim and grow in the same streams where the adults live. The tadpoles have light, shiny spots on their backs, sides, and tails. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. It may be in some danger because people cut down too many trees and build dams to make electricity. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
