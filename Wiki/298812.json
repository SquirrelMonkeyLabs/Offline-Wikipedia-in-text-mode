A vicar of Egloshayle named Thomas Lovibond was responsible for the building of the first bridge across the River Camel to replace a dangerous ford which was begun in 1468 and completed in 1485.Wadebridge and the Bridge on Wool at cornishlight.co.uk ==Churches== The parish church, named after St Petroc, is built almost entirely in the Perpendicular style. It has a Norman font, a stone pulpit dating from the 15th century, and a peal of eight bells. The Anglican chapel at Washaway, dating from 1882, has a font which is one of the earliest in the county. ==Forts and houses == Pencarrow House, seat of the Molesworths (18th century), and Croan House (17th century) are fine examples of smaller country houses.
