 "text": "The Stripe-throated rocket frog (Leucostethus yaguara) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. Scientists saw this frog on the dead leaves on the ground in forests with water in the air. They saw it about 1575 meters above sea level. Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams, but they did not see any. Scientists only saw this frog once and have not seen it since then. They do not know if it is in danger of dying out. But people cut down the forests where it lives to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
