 "text": "The WWE United Kingdom Championship, later known as the NXT United Kingdom Championship from 2020 to 2022, was a professional wrestling title owned by WWE and competed for by the men of NXT UK. It was created on 15 December 2016 and a 16-man tournament with British wrestlers happened on 14 and 15 January 2017 to crown the champion. Tyler Bate beat Pete Dunne in the final to become the first champion. It was also sometimes defended at NXT events and on independent wrestling shows in the United Kingdom before the COVID-19 pandemic. On 4 September 2022 at Worlds Collide, the title was made into one into the NXT Championship, retiring the title. Tyler Bate, the only man to hold the title more than once, was the final champion. The base design of the belt was similar to the WWE Championship belt introduced in 2014, with differences.WWE Superstars - WWE.com Instead of a large cut out of the WWE logo, the center plate was designed after the United Kingdom's royal coat of arms, featuring a lion and a horse, with a shield at the center. Above the shield were the crown jewels. When the championship was originally introduced, the shield at the center of the main plate featured the WWE logo, but that was changed to the NXT UK logo on 17 January 2020 when the title was renamed. == Tournament to crown the first champion == ==Reigns== Over the championship's nearly six year history, there were five reigns between four champions. Tyler Bate was the first champion and is also listed as the last champion. He also had the most reigns at two, he was the youngest champion at 19 (making him the second teenager to win a title in WWE), and his second reign was the shortest reign at 59 days (3 days as listed by WWE because of tape delay, despite Bate appearing as champion on NXT a couple of weeks before his title win aired). Walter had the longest reign, which lasted 870 days, and he was also the oldest champion when he won the title at 31.
