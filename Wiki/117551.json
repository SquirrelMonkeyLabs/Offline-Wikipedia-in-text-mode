 "text": "The Age is a newspaper made in Melbourne, Australia. It is owned by an Australian company called Nine, and its first edition was on 17 October 1854. The newspaper was first made by John and Henry Cooke. They also had a merchant business called Francis Cooke and Co.. They said they would use the newspaper to help miners in the Australian Gold Rush. The newspaper has become very popular since then. According to its website, it gets up to 957,000 on Saturdays. The editor, Andrew Jaspan, who got the job in 2004, got in trouble in 2008 when The Age journalists agreed that he had been making it hard for them to make news reports independently. In 2023, Patrick Elligett was appointed as Editor. == References == == Other websites == * The Age homepage * Video - \"A new chapter for The Age\" Category:Newspapers published in Australia Category:Organisations based in Melbourne Category:1854 establishments Category:1850s establishments in Australia",
