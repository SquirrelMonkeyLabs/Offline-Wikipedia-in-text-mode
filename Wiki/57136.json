During a masquerade (ball where people wear masks) in the city. Fortunato is dressed in a jester's costume. Montresor tells Fortunato he has bought a wine called amontillado. He wants Fortunato to test it to be sure it is real. Montresor leads Fortunato into his underground catacombs/wine cellar to test the wine. When there, Montressor chains Fortunato and then walls him up alive in a niche. Fortunato cries out \"For the love of God, Montresor!\" to which Montresor replies, \"Yes, for the love of God!\" He twice calls out for a reply but hears nothing. Before placing the last stone, he drops a burning torch through the gap, but hears only the jester's bells ringing. The crime took place 50 years before... Montressor expresses no regrets except for remarking about Fortunato: In pace requiescat! (\"May he rest in peace!\"). == Other websites == * \"The Cask of Amontillado\" - Full text of the first printing, from Godey's Lady's Book, 1846 * The Cask of Amontillado , found online at Ye Olde Library *The Cask of Amontillado at American Literature * Full text on PoeStories.com with hyperlinked vocabulary words. * Free-to-download MP3 dramatisation of the story (Yuri Rasovsky) Category:19th-century American short stories Category:Short stories by Edgar Allan Poe",
