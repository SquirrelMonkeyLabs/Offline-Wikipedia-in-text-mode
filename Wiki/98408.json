 "text": "Chiron is the name given to a moon of Saturn claimed to be sighted by Hermann Goldschmidt in 1861 which he said, orbited between Titan and Hyperion. But it has since been determined that it does not exist as it was never seen again for more than 100 years. It is now known as a centaur, which was found in 1977, named 2060 Chiron. == References == Category:Saturn's moons",
