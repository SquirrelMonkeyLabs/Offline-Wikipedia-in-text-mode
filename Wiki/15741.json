 "text": "The Cherimoya (Annona cherimola), also called the custard apple, is a sweet fruit that comes mostly from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia. The inside of a cherimoya is soft, and it is white in color. The skin of the cherimoya fruit is green when it is ripe, and brown if it becomes too ripe. The cherimoya has large, black seeds. The cherimoya is special because it can be grown in high places. In India, especially in North India, this fruit is known as sitafal (named after Sita). In Sri Lanka it is known as \"Wali Anoda (වැලි අනෝදා)\". It is grown in Reggio Calabria as well. Category:Annona",
