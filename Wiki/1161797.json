The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with a light line down each side of the body and another line closer to the belly. There are other marks on the back. ==Home== This frog lives in Amazon rainforests. Scientists have seen the frog between 450 and 1150 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in two protected parks: Parque Nacional Sangay and Reserva Biológica El Quimi. ==Name== Scientists named this frog fratisenescus for the Latin words for \"older brother.\" They chose this name because the frog is one of the biggest in its group. ==Young== Scientists think that the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings cut down trees to make places for cows and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
