 "text": "Xenophilius Lovegood is a fictional character of the Harry Potter series. He is the father of Luna Lovegood (friend of Harry Potter), and the editor of The Quibbler, a magazine in which he writes the things that just he believes, such as Nargles and Crumple-Horned Snorkack. However, during the Second Wizarding War, his magazine published reliable news, to the point that most people switched to it for news. Only when his daughter was kidnapped that the Quibbler started to turn against Harry Potter. Lovegood was played by Rhys Ifans in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
