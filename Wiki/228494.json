 "text": "Leeroy Jenkins is the name of a player character who was in the game World of Warcraft, created by Ben Shultz. He made a video which was put onto Youtube, and it became very popular. He has become known and even has his own achievement on World of Warcraft for pretending to be him in the video. Leeroyâ€™s name is often spelt wrong as Leroy Jenkins who is a real different person. The video, which made Leeroy famous, shows him and his friends doing a friendly activity known as a Raid in World of Warcraft, but this activity is hard to do, so the leader of the group that Leeroy is with has to explain what to do. But Leeroy is not around for the explanation, preparing some chicken, and when he comes back, he ends up running in the area, shouting his own name as he goes, which begins the activity, and ruining the plan which his friends made. This causes everyone to panic, and no-one knows what to do, and so, everyone dies. Everyone blames Leeroy for this, and he says \"At least I got chicken.\" Leeroy has become very well known and his name is now used by people to show that they are running in but have no idea what to do. These people should be avoided, as they may cause you to die as well, as the video shows. Because of this, people now consider the video to be a lesson. == Other websites == *Leeroy Jenkins on YouTube Category:Blizzard Entertainment Category:Video game characters Category:Video game memes",
