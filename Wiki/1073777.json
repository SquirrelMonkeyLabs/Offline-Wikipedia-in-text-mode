Current President Sauli Niinistö is term-limited and cannot run for re-election since he has served the maximum two terms. Had the new president been elected in the first round on 28 January by winning more than half of valid votes cast, their term would have begun on 1 February. However, No candidate received a majority of votes. Alexander Stubb and Pekka Haavisto ran in a runoff on 11 February with Stubb winning 51.6% to Haavisto's 48.4%. The result in the second round was the closest in the history of presidential elections in Finland. Stubb will be inaugurated as president on 1 March. ==Candidates== ===Confirmed=== Candidate name political party Experience(s) Campaign logo Mika Aaltola Independent Director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs (since 2019) Li Andersson Left Alliance Leader of the Left Alliance (since 2016) Minister of Education (2019–2020, 2021–2023) MP for Finland Proper (since 2015) Sari Essayah KD Minister of Agriculture and Forestry (since 2023) Leader of the Christian Democrats (since 2015) MP for Savo-Karelia (since 2015) MEP (2009–2014) 2012 presidential candidate Pekka Haavisto Independent (VIHR) MP for Helsinki (1987–1995, since 2007) Minister for Foreign Affairs (2019–2023) Minister of the Environment and Development (1995–1999) Leader of the Green League (1993–1995) 2012 and 2018 presidential candidate Jussi Halla-aho Finns Speaker of the Parliament of Finland (since 2023) Leader of the Finns Party (2017–2021) MP for Helsinki (2011–2014, since 2019) MEP (2014–2019) Hjallis Harkimo Liik Leader of the Movement Now(since 2018) MP for Uusimaa (since 2015) Olli Rehn Independent (Centre) Governor of the Bank of Finland (since 2018) Minister of Economic Affairs (2015–2016) European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro (2010–2014) European Commissioner for Enlargement (2004–2010) MP for Helsinki (1991–1995, 2015–2017) Alexander Stubb National Coalition 43rd Prime Minister of Finland (2014–2015) Minister of Finance (2015–2016) Minister for European Affairs and Trade (2011–2014) Minister for Foreign Affairs (2008–2011) Leader of the National Coalition Party (2014–2016) MEP (2004–2008) MP for Uusimaa (2011–2017) Jutta Urpilainen SDP European Commissioner for International Partnerships (since 2019) Minister of Finance (2011–2014) Leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (2008–2014) MP for Vaasa (2003–2019) ===Disqualified=== Candidate name political party Experience(s) Ano Turtiainen VKK MP for Southeast Finland (2019–2023) Paavo Väyrynen Independent (tl) MEP for Finland (2014–2018) Minister for Foreign Trade and International Development from (2007–2011) Minister of Labour (1976–1977) Minister of Education (1975–1976) MP for Lapland (1970–1991, 2007–2011) MP for Uusimaa (1991–1995) 1988, 1994, 2012, and 2018 presidential candidate ==Polls== Poll source Fieldwork dates Aaltola Ind.
