She was the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and Adela of France and the mother of Robert Curthose, William II and Henry I. ==Early life== Matilda was the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, and Adela of France, who was the daughter of King Robert II of France.David C. Douglas, William The Conqueror (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964), p. 391 Historians think she was born about 1031.David C. Douglas, William The Conqueror (Berkeley; Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1964), p. 392 Care was given to her education and so she would become known for her learning as much as for her great beauty.Agnes Strickland, Lives of the Queens of England, Volume I (Philadelphia: G. Barrie & Son, 1902), p. 23 Matilda, like other princesses of her day, was very skilled at fine needlework. Matilda was well respected because she was a part of a large royal family. She was related to many kings in Europe including Charlemagne. Matilda was a very small woman in size, and some reports said she was only 4 ft 2 in (129.5 cm).Tracy Borman, Queen of the Conqueror: The Life of Matilda, Wife of William I (New York: Bantam Books, 2011), p. 18 ==Duchess of Normandy== Matilda married William the Conqueror probably between 1051 and 1052 while she was still a teenager.

It helped William that Matilda was related to an earlier English king, Alfred the Great. It was important to the English people to think that Matilda was herself part English. Matilda died on 3 November 1083, when she was about 52 years old. ==Family== Together, Matilda and William had ten children, including: *William II of England * Adela of Normandy, the mother of Stephen of England * Henry I of England *Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy after his father's death == References == Category:1031 births Category:1083 deaths Category:House of Normandy Category:Kings and Queens consort of England",
