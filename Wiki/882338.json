 "text": "Antiverse or antiuniverse is the hypothesis that every universe has a twin to balance the symmetries between two universes. In the antiverse of our universe every matter would be antimatter and the time would run back (from our point of view). The universe before the big bang and the universe after the bang may be viewed as a universe/anti-universe pair, emerging directly into the hot, radiation-dominated era we observe in our past. == References == Category:Matter Category:Astrophysics Category:Cosmology Category:Universe Category:Antimatter",
