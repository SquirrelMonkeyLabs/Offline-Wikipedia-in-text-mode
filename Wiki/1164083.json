 "text": "Khmer Republic (Khmer: សាធារណរដ្ឋខ្មែរ;French: République Khmer) was the name of Cambodia's government following the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk in the 1970 Cambodian coup d'état on 18 March. It was under the American - backed military dictatorship of Marshal Lon Nol. The government was overthrown by the Khmer Rouge in April 1975. The regime was established due to the Kingdom of Cambodia's inability to keep communist forces outside of the country's borders, as North Vietnamese forces de facto controlled large parts of the country's eastern borders. Following the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk and his Sangkum government, the Kingdom of Cambodia was maintained de jure status. It wasn't until 9 October 1970, after the removal of Queen Sisowath Kossamak that this regime was established. This ended Cambodia's alliance with China and North Vietnam, and cooperation with the Việt Cộng and began supporting South Vietnam and the United States governments, under Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Richard Nixon.
