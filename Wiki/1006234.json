 "text": "The Hiromine Shrine (広峯神社) is on top of Mt. Hiromine in Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture. It claims to be the main shrine of Gozu Tenno across Japan, but Yasaka-jinja Shrine also claims to be the main shrine of Gozu Tenno. It used to be a prefectural shrine, but now it is a Beppyo shrine under the Association of Shinto Shrines. People also call it Hiromine Gozu Tenno. It is an ancient shrine with a well-known name. The worship of Gozu Tenno was originally related to the belief in avoiding epidemics and disasters by appeasing malevolent spirits. However, at Hiromine shrine, the focus of worship shifted to praying for the fertility of rice cultivation. This became known as \"Hiromine Faith,\" and it is why the shrine is quite different from normal Gion faith shrines. This is evident in the rice planting festival and prayer festival that are held at the shrine. == Kuroda Takataka (Kanbei, Josui) Ancestral Tradition == In 2018, it was announced that a shrine would be built to honor Kuroda Takataka (also known as Kanbei) behind the main hall, and it was planned to be finished in the spring of 2019. Many people visit the shrine to worship Kuroda Kanbei and the land associated with the Kuroda family. There is a legend about Shigetaka Kuroda, a military commander during the Warring States period, in our shrine. The legend includes the use of letters such as \"Cho\", \"Masa\", \"Takashi\", and \"Kan\" in the name \"Kanbei\", suggesting a connection to Shigetaka Kuroda. However, no connection has been found, and he is believed to have come from a different family in Kurodasho, Taka County, not the Kuroda family of Omi Province. Historical records show that a senior vassal of the Kuroda family, Mr. Inokuchi, was a monk and priest at the shrine. A part of a Katsura tree discovered from the Mausoleum of Kuroda Shikinaka in Mega, Himeji City during the Edo period was enshrined at the newly built Kanbei Shrine. It was donated to Mine Shrine and became an object of worship at Kanbei Shrine. == Festival == ; New Year's Day Festival ( New Year's Day in January ) ; Setsubun, Risshun Yakuyoke Grand Festival Tondo Nosatsusai ( February Setsubun Day) ; Kinensai ( February 18 ) ; Rice planting festival ( April 3 ) : This is a traditional Shinto ceremony that is believed to bring a good harvest of rice. It is an important festival for Shrine, as they have been worshiping the god of agriculture for many years. The ceremony is designated as an intangible folk cultural property of Himeji City. Along with the prayer festival, this ceremony is performed to pray for a successful rice crop by simulating rice planting and harvesting before the actual rice cultivation of the year. On April 3 morning, a Shinto priest, dressed in a robe, is accompanied by a group of people to the main Shrine. The group includes an umbrella holder with a Kasa-boko, a hat with artificial cherry blossoms, and a red kimono. During the ceremony, there is a band in white robes and blue hakama playing festival music with flutes and drums. Rice fields are plowed by people wearing straw hats and plow hoes to create a temporary field. Seedlings carrying seedling boxes with balance poles parade in a procession. After reaching the main Shrine, a Kasahoko is set up in front of the main gate, and the Shinto priest prays. Then the rice paddy is divided into three parts for the three types of rice, Wase, Nakate, and Okute, and is filled with sand. A person puts a spade and a hoe in, and then Janohige, which looks like rice seedlings, are planted in each paddy field. The orchestra plays festival music in time with the planting. In the past, many people would come to the shrine for this festival, but in recent times, the number of visitors has decreased due to the decline of agriculture and the lack of people who can play festival music. The festival was temporarily suspended until 1996 when the local commerce and industry established a commendation society to revive the festival. Currently, three of the Saotomes are responsible for PR activities for Himeji City. ; Kokusai Festival ( April 18 ) : On April 18, the Hozorai Festival and horse-running ceremony take place, marking the end of the Shinto ritual that began on April 3. During the Hozorai Festival, the Shinto priest announces the results of the year's bountiful rice varieties and decorates the main shrine with three types of rice - Wase, Nakate, and Okute - that have been dedicated by neighboring farmers. In the past, some people received the dedicated rice paddy and sowed it in the nurseries of their own rice fields. The horse-running ceremony that follows is intended to boost the economy. Shinto priests dressed in costumes of military officers of the imperial court ride several horses and make three round trips from the Otabisho (Tenso-jinja Shrine) to the front of the main shrine. The priest must complete the race without falling off the horse to ensure a bountiful harvest. However, if the horse jumps or falls, it is believed that the harvest will be poor. During the Edo period, ten horses ran, and there were representations of the Himeji lords and horse presentations. Nowadays, only three horses run. Together with the rice planting festival, the Hozorai Festival and horse-running ceremony is the largest festival of the shrine, and it is said that the number of worshipers exceeded 100,000 before the war. ; Nagoshi Oharae and Chinowa Ritual ( June 30 ) : This is a Shinto ritual that serves to purify oneself of impurities from the first half of the year. It involves walking through a chinowa, which is a 2-meter-diameter circle made of grasses or other materials, that is set up in the shrine precincts. The act of walking through the chinowa is believed to wash away impurities and help one start anew. ; Autumn Grand Festival, Yoimiya ( October 17 ) ; Autumn Grand Festival, Main Shrine ( October 18 ) ; Onbashira Festival ( November 15 ) ; Kibi Festival ( October 2 of the lunar calendar ) : A festival to pray for passing exams. ; New Year's Eve Purification ( December 31 ) : A Shinto ritual to exorcise the impurity of the last half of the year. In addition, there is a Seven-Five-Three Festival in November, and various purifications (including on-site purifications) and shrine visits are accepted at any time. == Traffic access == === Train === * Get off at Nosato Station on the Bantan Line . === Bus === * From Himeji Station, take the Shinki Bus 4 or 6 bound for \"Hiromine\" and get off at \"Hiromine\", then walk for 40 minutes.
