 "text": "The Highwaymen were a Country music supergroup. It included four of the biggest stars at the time. All were well known for their pioneering influence on the outlaw country genre. These included Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. The group was active between 1985 and 1995. All four had worked together before in various combinations. Their first single, \"Highwayman,\" went to number one on the country charts. The album of the same name on Columbia Records also hit number one on the country album charts. Between the years of 1997 and 1999, Nelson, Kristofferson, Cash, and Jennings also provided the voice and dramatization for the \"Louis L'Amour Collection\". This was a four CD box set of seven Louis L'Amour stories published by the HighBridge Company. But the four were not credited as \"The Highwaymen\" in this work. Only one other recording artist ever appeared on a Highwaymen recording: Johnny Rodriguez. He provided a Spanish vocal on 'Deportee', a Woody Guthrie song, from \"Highwayman\". == Discography == === Albums === Year Album Label 1985 The Highwayman Columbia 1986 Live!
