The adult male frog is 31.6â€“34.7 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. There is yellow and green color on the sides of the body. There are spots on the upper belly. This frog has vomerine teeth in its jaw. The iris of the eye is gold in color. This frog lives in evergreen forests. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. However, human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build farms. The scientists named this frog for Professor Datong Yang of the Chinese Academy of Science. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
