 "text": "Dunaliella salina is a type of halophile pink micro-algae found in sea salt fields. Dunaliella salina is used in cosmetics and dietary supplements. Few organisms can survive in such highly saline conditions as salt evaporation ponds. To survive, these organisms have high concentrations of beta-carotene to protect against light, and high concentrations of glycerol to provide protection against osmotic pressure. This offers an opportunity for commercial biological production of these substances. Category:Extremophiles Category:Algae",
