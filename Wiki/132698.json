The game is set in a beach resort called Wuhu Island. == Gameplay == Wii Sports Resort is a collection of different sports games. There are twelve different sports. Two sports, Golf and Bowling, were also in Wii Sports. Wii Sports Resort is played similarly to Wii Sports. Players use the Wii Remote to do different things, such as swinging a sword or throwing a basketball. The game uses the Wii MotionPlus to make these movements more accurate. Up to 4 people can play at the same time, but some sports (like Swordplay) only let 1 or 2 people play at the same time. === List of sports === *Swordplay *Wakeboarding *Frisbee *Archery *Basketball *Table Tennis *Golf *Bowling *Power Cruising *Canoeing *Cycling *Air Sports == Notes == Category:2009 video games Category:Basketball video games Category:Bowling video games Category:Golf video games Category:Multiple-sport video games Category:Nintendo video games Category:Pack-in video games Category:Sports video games Category:Tennis video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii games Category:Wii-only games",
