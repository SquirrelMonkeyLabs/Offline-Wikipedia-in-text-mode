 "text": "Dred Scott (1799 â€“ September 17, 1858) was a slave in the United States of America who took legal action to get his freedom in the Dred Scott v. Sanford case. His case was rejected by the Supreme Court. Many people were angry at the decision, and slavery became one of the main issues in the American Civil War a few years later. Slavery was ended after the Confederate States of America surrendered. ==References== Category:Slaves Category:1799 births Category:1858 deaths",
