 "text": "The Georgia Dome was a domed stadium in Atlanta that opened in 1992 and was torn down in 2017. It was the largest domed building in the world until 1999. The Dome took up 9.19 acres of land and cost $214 million to build. It was supported by the State of Georgia, after which the stadium was named. It was not far from the CNN Center, Georgia World Congress Center and Philips Arena. Many different sporting events took place in the dome, mostly football and basketball. It was home to the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League until it was replaced by the nearby Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the 2017 season. ==Other websites== *Official website Category:National Football League venues Category:Football stadiums in the United States Category:Sports buildings in Atlanta Category:Atlanta Falcons Category:2017 disestablishments in the United States Category:1992 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Disestablishments in Georgia (U.S. state)",
