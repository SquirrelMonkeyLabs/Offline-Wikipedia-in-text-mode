It happened at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York on March 20, 1994. The main part of the pay-per-view was the WWF Championship, which lasted two matches. Lex Luger challenged the champion Yokozuna first. Luger was later for pushing the referee. Bret Hart faced Yokozuna later in the event. He won the championship by beating Yokozuna. This led to a long worked feud between Bret and his brother Owen.
