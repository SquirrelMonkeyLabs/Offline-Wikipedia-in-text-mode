 "text": "When elections are done in the United States, single US states are classified by their majority. In that context, in a blue state, the majority voted for a Democratic candidate, in a red state they voted for a Republican candidate. This classification has been in use since the year 2000. If people talk about a red or a blue state outside the context of an election, they refer to the party most people in the state usually support. Category:Politics of the United States",
