 "text": "World Idol was a one-time version of Pop Idol. It featured eleven contestants, who each were winners of a version of Pop Idol. Ten countries and one multi- country unit took part in the contest. The performance show was broadcast on Christmas Day 2003, with the results show aired on New Year's Day 2004. After presenting the competitors, viewers from the 11 participating countries were allowed to vote by telephone, but not for the participant from their home country. British presenters Ant & Dec hosted the show on most English speaking countries, while local presenters hosted for their own country in the local language. The winner was based on points. Based on the results of each country's public vote, each country awarded a number of points from 1 to 10 to each other country, using each number once (for example, first place of a vote got 10 points while last place got 1 point). == Leaderboard == No. Territory Performer Song Points 1 Norway Kurt Nilsen \"Beautiful Day\" 106 2 United States Kelly Clarkson \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" 97 3 Belgium Peter Evrard \"Lithium\" 83 4 South Africa Heinz Winckler \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" 80 5 United Kingdom Will Young \"Light My Fire\" 72 6 Canada Ryan Malcolm \"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\" 62 7 Australia Guy Sebastian \"What a Wonderful World\" 56 8 Poland Alicja Janosz \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" 55 9/10 Germany Alexander Klaws \"Maniac\" 45 Arabia Diana Karazon \"Ensani Ma Binsak\" 45 11 Netherlands Jamai Loman \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" 36 Category:Music competitions",
