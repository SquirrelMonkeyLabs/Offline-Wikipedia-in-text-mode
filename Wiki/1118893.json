 "text": "The Enumclaw horse sex case was an event that happened in 2005. It involved many people from Washington State. Kenneth D. Pinyan was an engineer who worked for Boeing and lived in Gig Harbor, Washington. James Michael Tait was a truck driver. It also involved Douglas Spink and other people who are not known. Pinyan and Tait made zoophilic pornography of Pinyan getting anal sex from a male horse. Pinyan had the alias \"Mr. Hands\". During one incident, Pinyan got an injury. He soon died from this injury. The story was described in The Seattle Times. It was one of their most read stories in 2005. Pinyan's death helped pass a bill in the Washington State Legislature that made sex with animals illegal. Today, bestiality is now a Class C felony in Washington. Bestiality was legal in Washington state at the time. Tait only went to jail for trespassing. He was given a one-year suspended sentence. ==References== ==Other websites== * *Boeing In Memoriam, September 2005 Category:Deaths from peritonitis Category:United States law Category:Accidental deaths in the United States Category:2005 in the United States Category:Pornography Category:Horses",
