 "text": "\"My Hometown\" is a 1985 song by Bruce Springsteen. It was the seventh and final single from his seventh studio album Born in the U.S.A.. It went to number 6 in Ireland and the United States, number 9 in the United Kingdom, number 16 in Canada, number 21 in Sweden, number 24 in the Netherlands, number 28 in New Zealand and number 47 in Australia. ==Track listing== #\"My Hometown\" - 4:33 #\"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" - 4:27 The B-side of the single, \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\", was a semi-comical live recording of the Christmas favourite from a Springsteen and E Street Band concert on December 12, 1975, at C. W. Post College on Long Island, New York. Long familiar to Springsteen fans from its distribution years earlier to rock radio stations, it had previously been released on the fairly unknown 1981 children's album In Harmony 2; now in time for the Christmas season it was being issued again. Always a radio favorite, \"Santa Claus\" would benefit from the all-holiday- music-all-the-time formats of the 2000s, and during the 2005 holiday season \"Santa Claus\" would appear on the Billboard Top 40 Adult Recurrents and Hot Digital Songs charts. ==References== Category:1985 songs Category:1980s ballads Category:Rock ballads Category:Heartland rock songs Category:Bruce Springsteen songs Category:U2 songs Category:Neil Young songs",
