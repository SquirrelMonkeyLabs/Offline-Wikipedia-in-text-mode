 "text": "Australia Day is a public holiday held on 26 January every year in Australia. It is celebrated to remember the day that the First Fleet landed in Australia. On 26 January 1788 British people landed at Sydney Cove and began a British convict settlement. ==Disputes== Some people do not believe that Australia Day should be celebrated on this date. For example, some indigenous Australians call the date Invasion Day or Survival Day because it was the day that their native land was invaded. == Arrival of the First Fleet == On 13 May 1787, 11 ships were sent from Great Britain to Australia. The ships carried mostly prisoners to Australia where many were going to be living the rest of their lives. The ships were led by Captain Arthur Phillip, who was later promoted to an Admiral. ==References== Category:National days Day, Australia Category:January observances",
