Many clients are basic and display text in one colour, but there are others that use colours, enhancing the readability of the contents. === Action role-playing === Action RPGs are role-playing video games with action game elements. === Roguelike === \"Roguelike\" is a term for games that use the primary mechanics from the 1980 video game Rogue.
