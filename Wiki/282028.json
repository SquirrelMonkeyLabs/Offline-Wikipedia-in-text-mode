However, the band caught the attention of a lot of extreme metal fans. In 1994 another demo, The Arrival of the Fimbul Winter, was recorded and 1,000 copies were released. They then signed with Metal Blade Records and released their first album, Once Sent from the Golden Hall. The album made Amon Amarth famous internationally.
