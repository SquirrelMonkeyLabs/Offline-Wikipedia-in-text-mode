Timothy R. Levine (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2014), p. 854 By 1996 it was in general use. The Oxford English Dictionary at first defined it as \"a person whose actions are controlled by another\".

Such users are actually real individuals that come to support another user. If a person uses real people to create accounts that support that person's opinions, this form of meatpuppetry is often called \"astroturfing\", a type of false impression of support. == References == == Other websites == * Unmask Wikipedia sock puppets by the way they write * How to Recognize an Internet Sockpuppet * Revealed: US spy operation that manipulates social media Category:Internet culture Category:Pseudonyms",
