 "text": "The Uighur alphabet (also: Uyghur alphabet) is the alphabet created by the Uighurs to read and write the Uighur language. It is based on the Arabic alphabet. Unlike the Arabic alphabet, however, Uighur has specific letters to write vowel sounds, rather than just diacritic marks. Writing vowels in Uighur is required, not optional. This means that the writing system is a true alphabet, not an abjad like Arabic. ==Letters== The modern Uyghur Arabic alphabet has 8 vowels, 24 consonants, and 32 letters in all.
