 "text": "Marshosaurus is a genus of medium to large-sized carnivorous theropod dinosaur. It is from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of Utah and Colorado. This carnivore was once common in the same territory as the larger and more dangerous Allosaurus. It was about 4.5 metres long and weighed 200 kg. It most likely preyed on giant sauropod dinosaurs such as Camarasaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Supersaurus, Brontosaurus, Seismosaurus, Haplocanthosaurus and Brachiosaurus, as well as stegosaurs such as Hesperosaurus and Stegosaurus. It also lived at the same time as three other carnivores of the era, including Ornitholestes, Torvosaurus and Ceratosaurus. == Prey sources == Amongst Marshosaurus's main prey sources were Apatosaurus, Supersaurus, Hesperosaurus and Brontosaurus. But other than meals, it had a few rivals. Some other carnivores that were its rivals included Saurophaganax, Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Torvosaurus and Antrodemus. == References == Category:Theropods Category:Jurassic dinosaurs",
