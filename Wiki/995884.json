 "text": "The Los Angeles Metro Rail is an urban transit system in Los Angeles County, California. It is operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro). The system has a total of six lines and 102 stations. Four lines are light rail (A, C, E, K), and two are rapid transit (B and D). The Los Angeles Metro Rail system also connects to the Metro Busway (G & J), Metrolink, Amtrak, and other transit services. The A Line is the oldest in the system. It opened on July 14, 1990. Since then, the system continued to expand to more places. More expansions are currently under construction such as the D Line Extension to West Los Angeles. , the Los Angeles Metro Rail light rail system is the busiest in the United States. The rapid transit lines are the ninth busiest. == Current system == === Lines === The Los Angeles Metro Rail system includes six lines and 102 stations. The lines used to be named by colors, but are now known by letters since 2020. Metro also uses the same line letter naming system for its Metro Busway lines. Below is the list of the rail lines and how many stations each go to: Line Name Stations Termini Type Opened A Line 44 APU/Citrus College Downtown Long Beach Light rail July 14, 1990 B Line 14 North Hollywood Union Station Rapid transit January 30, 1993 C Line 11 Aviation/Century Norwalk Light rail August 12, 1995 D Line 8 Wilshire/Western Union Station Rapid transit January 30, 1993 E Line 29 Downtown Santa Monica Atlantic Light rail April 28, 2012 K Line 13 Expo/Crenshaw Westchester/Veterans (north section) Aviation/Century Redondo Beach (south section) Light rail October 7, 2022 === Stations === Los Angeles Metro Rail has 102 stations. The light rail stations are mostly above ground, but some are underground. Rapid transit stations (B and D Lines) are all underground. Each station has ticket vending machines, maps, electronic displays, and artwork reflecting the local culture. All stations also have elevators or ramps. The underground stations generally are larger and have two levels. The top level is where passengers can buy tickets. The bottom level is where passengers board trains. The underground stations are built to withstand earthquakes. === Fares === To travel on Metro, passengers need a Transit Access Pass (TAP) card. They can get them from machines at every station. To make sure people buy it, there are people on the system who check if passengers have the card. With a TAP card, passengers can switch between Metro routes for free within 2 hours of their first ride. Starting from July 2023, Metro has made using a TAP card easier for people. They have replaced their 1-Day, 7-Day, and 30-Day passes with fare capping. This means that riders will never have to pay more than $5 (for up to 3 rides) in a day or $18 (for up to 11 rides) within seven days. Once riders reach the 1-day or 7-day fare cap, they can travel on the system for free. Fares for students, seniors, disabled, or low-income people are even cheaper. The graph below shows the different fare types and their prices: Fare type Regular Senior (62+) Disabled/Medicare Students (K-12; College) Low Income One-way trip $1.75 $0.35 (all other times) $0.75 (rush hours) $0.75 20 free rides then Regular fare 1-Day Cap $5 $2.50 $2.50 7-Day Cap $18 $5 $6 === Safety === The Los Angeles Metro Rail has the Sheriff's Department watching around half of the system's trains and stations. The Los Angeles Police Department and Long Beach Police Department are also responsible for stations in their respective cities. Security staff keeps an eye on the system through closed-circuit television cameras. == History == Before the Los Angeles Metro Rail system, the Pacific Electric Railway and Los Angeles Railway were the two urban train systems in Los Angeles County. The systems were in operation from 1901 to 1961. In 1927, the two systems started replacing their rail lines with buses since more people in the county were using cars for transport. In 1958, the systems were taken over by a government agency. It was known as the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). By 1963, all rail lines were gone and replaced with buses. In the 1970s, people started wanting the return of rail transit. This was because traffic was increasing on the county's freeways and roads. Also, gas prices and the population of the area were growing quickly. During the decade, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) began planning the first new train lines. In 1980, Proposition A was passed to pay for the construction of the new lines. The Blue Line (now the A Line) was the first light rail line in Los Angeles constructed since Proposition A. It opened on July 14, 1990. It initially ran from Long Beach to Downtown Los Angeles at 7th Street/Metro Center station. From its start, the line was very popular. Los Angeles's first rapid transit lines (B and D) opened later in January 1993. The light rail system continued to expand with the C Line in 1995, the L Line in 2003 (now part of the A and E Lines), and the E Line in 2012. The newest line, the K Line, opened in 2022. == References == Category:Transport in California Category:1990 establishments in California",
