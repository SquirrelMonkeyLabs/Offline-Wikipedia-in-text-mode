 "text": "Linear B is an ancient script that was used to write Mycenaean Greek, the oldest known form of Ancient Greek, as has been proved by Michael Ventris in the early 1950s.Ventris, Michael & Chadwick, John 1973. Documents in Mycenaean Greek. 2nd ed, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Linear B came before the Greek alphabet by several centuries. The script is based on Linear A, a script that cannot be read today. The oldest texts written in Linear B date from about 1450 BC. Linear B was found mainly in the palace archives at Knossos, Cydonia, Pylos, Thebes and Mycenae. The writing of Linear B language disappeared with the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. There are about 87 signs in Linear B that represent syllables. In addition, there are many ideographic signs that represent objects or commodities. They do not represent sounds and are never used as word signs in writing a sentence. Linear B seems to have been used only for administration. In the thousands of clay tablets, a relatively small number of different \"hands\" (or writers) have been detected: 45 in Pylos (on west coast of the Peloponnese, in southern Greece) and 66 in Knossos (Crete). The script may have been used only by a guild of professional scribes, who worked at the different palaces. When the palaces were destroyed, the script was forgotten. ==References== Category:Writing systems Category:Ancient Greece",
