 "text": "The Shaggs were an American all-female rock group formed in Fremont, New Hampshire in 1968. The band was composed of sisters Dorothy \"Dot\" Wiggin (vocals/lead guitar), Betty Wiggin (vocals/rhythm guitar), Helen Wiggin (drums), and later Rachel Wiggin (bass). The sisters' father, Austin Wiggin, made Dot, Betty and Helen start a band. When Austin was young, his mother had predicted that Austin would have daughters who would be part of a famous music group. The band's only studio album, Philosophy of the World, was released in 1969. The album was not very well-known, though the band's live performances were popular in their local area. The Shaggs disbanded in 1975 after the death of Austin. Helen Wiggin died in 2006. The widow of Austin Wiggin, Jr., Annie Wiggin, died in 2005. ==Members== *Dorothy \"Dot\" Wiggin — vocals, guitar (1968-1975, 1999) *Betty Wiggin — guitar, vocals (1968-1975, 1999) *Helen Wiggin (deceased) — drums (1968-1975) *Rachel Wiggin — bass guitar (1969-1975) *Tom Ardolino — drums (1999) ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Philosophy of the World (1969) ===Collections=== * Shaggs' Own Thing (1982) * The Shaggs (1990 - includes all studio recordings) * Rev-ola (2004 - imported repackaging of The Shaggs with same track listing) ===Tribute albums=== * Better Than The Beatles - A Tribute to the Shaggs (2001) ===V/A compilations=== * Songs In The Key of Z - The Curious Universe of Outsider Music (2000) ==References== * Chusid, Irwin.
