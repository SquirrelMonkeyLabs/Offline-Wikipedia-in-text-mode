 "text": "The WAGR D class were a total of 20 large side tank steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1912 to 1964. The D class were built by the North British Locomotive Coy as 4-6-4s for suburban passenger services in and around Perth, however, some also performed goods runs to Bunbury and Northam. All but one were superheated from 1932 forming the Ds class, one of which also had its side tanks extended, becoming the prototype for the Dm and Dd classes. Withdrawals started in 1953 until the last was withdrawn in 1965, all were scrapped. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
