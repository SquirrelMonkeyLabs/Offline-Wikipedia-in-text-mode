 "text": "QAnon () is a disproven far-right conspiracy theory believing that a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is running a global child sex-trafficking ring and are planning against former US president Donald Trump, who is fighting the cabal. QAnon also believes that Trump is planning a day known as the \"Storm\", when thousands of members of the cabal will be arrested. No part of the conspiracy claim is based in fact. QAnon's supporters have accused many liberal Hollywood actors, Democratic politicians, and high-ranking government officials of being members of the cabal. Former followers of the group have criticized it for vandalism of stores and general antisocial behavior. Members of the movement actively took part in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, during which they supported Donald Trump's campaign. After Joe Biden won, they were involved in efforts to overturn the results of the election. Many of the QAnon followers attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, which caused many media websites to track down and block QAnon information and members from spreading. ==References== Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Donald Trump",
