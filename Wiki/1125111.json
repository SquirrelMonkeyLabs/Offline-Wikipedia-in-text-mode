Alfréd Hajós, the winner of the 100m, tried to win all 3 open swimming events. However, he did not swim in the 500m because it started after the 100 metres. Efstathios Chorafas was the only swimmer to swim in all three events. ==Background== This was the only Olympic Games with a 500-metre freestyle swimming event. The 1900 Olympics had 200- and 1000-metre events. In the 1904 Olympics, the 400-metre swim was used. This became the standard for swimming after that. ==Competition== This freestyle swimming competition was in a single race. All of the swimmers swam at the same time. The swimmers were taken out by a ship into the Bay of Zea. The swimmers would swim back to the shore.Official Report, part 2, p. 96. ==Schedule== The 500 metre freestyle was the third of the swimming events.
