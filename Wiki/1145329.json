 "text": "The zucchetto is a small skullcap worn by Roman Catholic clergy. It can be worn alone or under other headgear, like the mitre or biretta. == Use == The zucchetto is usually worn with a cassock by bishops, cardinals, and the pope. During Mass, it must be removed at the Liturgy of the Eucharist. == History == The zucchetto originated from the pileus (a brimless cap worn in ancient Rome). It likely became common among clergy in the 13th century to cover their shaved heads (tonsures). The current use of the zucchetto was set by Pope Paul VI in 1968. It is required only for Church leaders. == Design and colors == Each zucchetto is made from eight triangular panels sewn together, often with a small stem on top. It is traditionally made of silk or polyester. Its color shows the wearerâ€™s rank: * White for the pope * Red for cardinals * Purple for bishops and archbishops * Black for priests and deacons == Related pages == * Biretta * Chasuble * Dalmatic == References == Category:Christian clothing Category:Headgear Category:Liturgical clothing",
