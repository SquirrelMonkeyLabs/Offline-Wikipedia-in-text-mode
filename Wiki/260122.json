He played for the Baltimore Ravens, St. Louis Rams, and Oakland Raiders. Boller was drafted out of the University of California by the Baltimore Ravens with the 19th pick in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft. He also played for the St. Louis Rams in 2009. Boller has been considered a professional bust, as his success with any of his NFL teams was very limited, unlike his college football career. Boller is married to former Miss California, Carrie Prejean. On July 27, 2012, Boller signed a deal with the San Diego Chargers. However, he didn't play for them and retired the next day. ==References== ==Other websites== *Kyle Boller at oaklandraiders.com Category:1981 births Category:Living people Boller, Kyle Boller, Kyle Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Football players from California Category:Sportspeople from Burbank, California Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:St. Louis Rams players",
