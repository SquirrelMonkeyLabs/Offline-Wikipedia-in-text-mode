 "text": "Thrive is an free and open-source evolution simulation video game for Windows and Linux. The development of the game first started in 2009 and in 2016, it was released as an early access title via Steam and itch.io. The game is inspired by the 2008 video game Spore but goes for a much more scientifically- accurate approach. == Gameplay == Similar to Spore, it is a game about controlling the evolution of a species, through 7 stages of evolution. Currently, Unicellular Stage is the only playable stage, which just like Spore is also played through a 2D tidepool-like space. The player can evolve by mutating new organelles and functions.
