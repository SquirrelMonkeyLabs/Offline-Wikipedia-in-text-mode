 "text": "The Wrangell Mountains are a high mountain range of eastern Alaska in the United States. Much of the range is in the Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park and Preserve. The Wrangell Mountains were made by volcanoes. The second and third tallest volcanoes in the United States, Mount Blackburn and Mount Sanford are there. The range takes its name from Mount Wrangell, which is one of the largest shield volcanoes in the world. It is also the only mountain in the range that is an active volcano. The Wrangell Mountains are just to the northwest of the Saint Elias Mountains and northeast of the Chugach Mountains. There are so many mountains there that they block the warm moist air over the Pacific Ocean. Because of this places north of the Wrangell Mountains are some of the coldest areas of North America during the winter. ==Major peaks== The Wrangell Mountains include 12 of the 40+ Alaskan peaks over *Mount Blackburn, , and East Summit, *Mount Sanford], , and South Peak, *Mount Wrangell, , and West Summit, *Atna Peaks, *Regal Mountain, *Mount Jarvis, , and North Peak, *Parka Peak, *Mount Zanetti, Another prominent mountain is Mount Drum, , which can be seen from a very long way away. ==Name== The Wrangell Mountains are named after an explorer who was also president of the Russian-American Company, Admiral Ferdinand von Wrangel. American folk singer John Denver wrote a song, \"Wrangell Mountain Song\", in reference to the range. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==Other websites== *Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve *Wrangell Mountains Center Category:Mountain ranges of Alaska",
