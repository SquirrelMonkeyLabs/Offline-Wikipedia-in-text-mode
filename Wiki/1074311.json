 "text": "An intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is something that is considered by UNESCO to be part of a place's cultural heritage. Buildings, historic places, monuments, and artifacts are cultural property, not intangible heritage. Intangible heritage is things like folklore, customs, beliefs, traditions, knowledge, and language. Intangible cultural heritage is considered by member states of UNESCO to be like the tangible World Heritage but focusing on intangible parts of culture. In 2001, UNESCO made a survey among countries and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion. ==References== Category:UNESCO Category:Traditions Category:Cultural anthropology",
