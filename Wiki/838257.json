It stands 1800 feet above sea level and holds various archaeological and historical significances. The highest point gives a beautiful view of Thiruvananthapuram city along with the Arabian Sea and it was opened for visitors on 20th October 2016. ==History of Rock-Cut Temple== Madavoorpara Shiva Temple, the most important attribute of the view point, dates back to the 9th century CE and is known for its architecture, as it was carved from a single rock. It is in the lowest part of the viewpoint. The cave temple is open from 6am to 10 am and from 5pm to pm everyday, maintaining its rituals and religious festivities regularly. It is also one of the rarest rock-cut temples in the state. On the pillars of the temple, an ancient Malayalam script, named Vattezhuthu had been inscribed which was used ages ago which is a rare sight. The main deity of the temple is Lord Shiva. ==The View Point== ===Bamboo Bridge=== The Bamboo Bridge is one of the finest facilities that is stretched at a length of 100m.

There is also an open stage built for future ventures including programmes, exhibitions and many more literary and cultural events.
