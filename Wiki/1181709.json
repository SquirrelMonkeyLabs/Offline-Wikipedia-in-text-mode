Bible (also known as the Trump Bible) is a collection of texts containing an edition of the King James Version of the Christian Bible and texts about the foundation and politics of the United States such as the Constitution of the United States, Declaration of Independence, and the Pledge of Allegiance. The collection was created by singer Lee Greenwood and first published in 2021. It was later promoted by Donald Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. ==History== The book was published in May 2021 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of September 11 attacks. The text of the Bible was intended to be the New International Version, but Zondervan, the division of HarperCollins that owns the rights to the New International Version, withheld them after multiple public complaints, and the King James Version was used instead, which is in the public domain in the United States. ==References== Category:2021 books",
