 "text": "A hiatal hernia is a kind of hernia in which abdominal organs, usually the stomach, slip through the diaphragm. This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (or GERD) or heartburn. There are other symptoms, like dysphagia (or trouble swallowing) and chest pain. Other problems may include bowel obstruction and iron deficiency anemia. The most common risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors are scoliosis, injury and several types of surgery. Between ten and eighty percent of people in the United States are affected with hiatal hernias. The symptoms from a hiatal hernia might be improved by changes, like weight loss, changing eating patterns and raising the head of a bed. == Types of hiatal hernia == Sliding hiatal hernia:- This happens when part of the stomach and the place where the stomach and esophagus meet slide up into chest through the opening (hiatus). Paraesophageal hernia:- Happens when part of stomach pushes up through the opening (hiatus) into chest and is next to the esophagus. == Symptoms == * Burping * Feeling nauseous * Vomiting * Backflow (reflux) of acid or stomach contents into the esophagus or throat * Heartburn * Regurgitation * Trouble swallowing ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the digestive system",
