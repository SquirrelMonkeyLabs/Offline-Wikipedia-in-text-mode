 "text": "Tamal was a king of the Blemmyes who ruled in Lower Nubia in the late fourth or early fifth century. Tamal is known so far from three short Greek inscriptions found at the temple of Kalabsha. The inscriptions are difficult to understand, but they appear to concern land donations to high-ranking individuals. One of the inscriptions mentions a high priest, which proves that pagan temple operations in Kalabsha were still functioning at this time. == Literature == * László Török, in: Fontes Historiae Nubiorum, Vol. III, Bergen 1998, pp. 1128–1135, ISBN 82-91626-07-3 Category:Nubian monarchs Category:Rulers (4th century) Category:Rulers (5th century) Category:Born in the 4th or 5th century Category:Died in the 4th or 5th century Category:Men",
