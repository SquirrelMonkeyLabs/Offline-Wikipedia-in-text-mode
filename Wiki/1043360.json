 "text": "Manhala Lahore, Pakistan (English: منہالہ) is a populated place in Pakistan located in Lahore District, Punjab, Pakistan. ==Manhala is a city or a village?== Manhala is said to be a village but actually it is like a city. It is spread over an inhabited area of 400 acres. Where all kinds of facilities are available. There are hospital and police station, WAPDA office, welfare office, union council office and numerous facilities. Here, Sindh Bank is busy serving the people. Minhala manages 36 small and big villages including Laloh, Karanke, Dhir K, Chhankuvandi, Korian, Nathuki, Pade, Bhini, Nawan Pind Gujran, Mojoke and many more villages. It's a complete exaggeration. You tell yourself what is the thing that is in the cities and not in Manhala. Rather, everything that is in the cities is here. But it is impossible to have everything of Manhala in the cities.
