 "text": "The Gundia Indian frog, Gundia frog, or Gundia leaping frog (Indirana gundia) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests where there are dead leaves and rocks on the ground. This frog cannot live where all the trees are gone or where they are too small for the branches to come together like a roof. People have seen this frog between 66 and 1080 meters above sea level. ==Young== The frog lays eggs on the ground or on rocks. This frog's tadpoles do not live in the water and instead move across wet rocks and moss using their tails and their back legs. Their back legs grow on them sooner than other tadpoles' back legs. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out because the place it lives is becoming worse. However, its habitat is not cut into groups so that the frogs in each piece cannot go to each other. People change the place where it lives to make places to raise animals, to get wood to use, to make roads, and to make things for visitors. In some places, people change the place where the frog lives to grow coffee plants. Making things to stop landslides can hurt this frog by changing the rocks that it lives on. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, Kudremukh National Park, Kempholey Reserve Forest, Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, and Ranipuram Vested Forest . Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, but they do not know how much danger the frog is in from the fungus. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
