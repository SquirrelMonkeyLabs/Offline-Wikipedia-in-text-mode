 "text": "Fraser Thorneycroft-Smith (born 8 February 1971) is a London-based music producer and songwriter. It was in the 1990s when he began playing guitar in the studio, recording over 300 releases with artists such as Jamiroquai, Tim Deluxe, Rui Da Silva, Rita Ora, Adele, Stormzy, N-Dubz, Dave and Rick Wakeman. In 2000, Fraser met with a then not-as-famous Craig David, and began performing acoustically around the world. Craig and Fraser also formed Treats, a remix team specialising in UK garage and R&B.; Having toured consistently for over 15 years, Fraser turned his attention to producing and writing full time and began working with Kano. The pair wrote and produced \"Typical Me\" and \"Signs in Life\" amongst others on Kano's successful debut album. Fraser then began writing and producing with Plan B (\"Dead and Buried\", \"Kids\", etc.) on his critically acclaimed debut. The following months he bought tracks from Beyonc√©, Eamon, Jamelia in and out of the studio, before Fraser concentrated on co-writing upcoming the next releases for both Kano and Craig David. The fact that both artists, who have a lot of respect for each other, were constantly in and out of the studio, led to the collaboration \"This Is the Girl\" (Kano with Craig David). Fraser received the 2008 Urban Music Award for \"Best Producer\".
