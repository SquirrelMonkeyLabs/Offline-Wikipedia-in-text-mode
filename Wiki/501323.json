 "text": "There are 6 arrondissements in the Gironde department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The 6 arrondissements of Gironde are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 331 Blaye Blaye 88,115 782.4 63 332 Bordeaux Bordeaux 921,668 1,521.8 82 333 Langon Langon 130,911 2,644.3 197 334 Lesparre-Médoc Lesparre-Médoc 86,560 2,274.4 50 335 Libourne Libourne 152,602 1,282.9 129 336 Arcachon Arcachon 146,160 1,469.8 17 ==History== Since its creation, the Gironde department has had some changes: * 1790 : creation of the Gironde department with seven districts: Bordeaux, Libourne, La Réole, Bazas, Cadillac, Blaye and Lesparre.
