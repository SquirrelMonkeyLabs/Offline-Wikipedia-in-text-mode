 "text": "The hammerjaw (Omosudis lowii) is a small deep-sea fish found worldwide in tropical and temperate waters to 4,000 m (13,000 ft) depth. It is the only member of its family, Omosudidae. These creatures are prey of lancetfish and tuna. == Description == It resembles a small viperfish. The large head is dominated by a massive, truncated lower jaw and large, creepy eyes. The lower jaw has a black chin. Its mouth is quite scary because of its oversized, transparent, and dagger-like teeth; the palatine bones possess 1â€“4 pairs of slightly smaller teeth. == Life history == Very little is known of the hammerjaw's life history. === How they swim === It is inferred from their sporadic capture and sleek morphology that hammerjaws are swift swimmers, which makes them impossible for you to catch. === Diet === They are carnivorous and feed on squid and others. == Related pages == * European eel * Cyprinodontiformes * Freshwater fish * Evolution of fish == References == * \"Omosudis lowii\".
