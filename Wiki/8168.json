They went on to be one of the most successful bands of the decade, selling over 50 million albums worldwide. Grohl joined shortly before the release of Nevermind. Nevermind proved to be a classic album, one that is still a big influence on the alternative metal and alternative rock scene. The band only recorded one more studio album though, In Utero in 1993. On April 8, 1994, Kurt Cobain's body was found at his home in Seattle. He had shot himself in the head with a shotgun. This event ended Nirvana and Grohl started his own band Foo Fighters in 1995. === Foo Fighters === The original Foo Fighters album was recorded entirely by Grohl himself. He recorded the parts for each instrument one at a time and then combined them. Foo Fighters are now a multi Grammy Award winning rock band and sell out huge arenas when they are on tour. ==References== Category:1969 births Category:American punk musicians Category:American rock drummers Category:American rock guitarists Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Ohio Category:Musicians from Virginia Category:Nirvana (band) members Category:Nine Inch Nails",
