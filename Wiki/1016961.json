Greta Gerwig was confirmed as the director and co-writer with Noah Baumbach in 2021. The filming took place at Warner Bros.

Pictures. The movie was released the same day as Oppenheimer, a biographical thriller movie directed by Christopher Nolan. Since both movies are from opposite genres and are being released on the same day, the term \"Barbenheimer\" describes this and has become an internet meme. The movie crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the first movie by a solo female director to do so. Barbie became the highest- grossing live-action-comedy movie of all time. == References == == Other websites == * * Category:2023 romance movies Category:2023 comedy movies Category:2020s romantic comedy movies Category:2023 fantasy movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:American satirical movies Category:American fantasy-comedy movies Category:Self-reflexive movies Category:Warner Bros. movies Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:2020s English-language movies Category:Feminist movies",
