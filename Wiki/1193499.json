 "text": "Interglossa is a simple, made-up language created in 1943 by British scientist Lancelot Hogben. He designed it to help people from different countries communicate easily, especially in science and technology. == Key features == * No word changes: In Interglossa, words don't change form. This means the same word can be used in different ways without adding endings or changing spelling. * Simple grammar: The language uses word order and a few helper words to show meaning, similar to how Chinese works. * Small vocabulary: It has about 880 basic words, mostly from Greek and Latin, which are common in science. * Easy spelling: Each letter represents one sound, and spelling is regular and phonetic. == Purpose == Hogben wanted to create a language that was easy to learn and use, helping people from different backgrounds talk to each other, especially in scientific fields. == Evolution == Later, in the 1970s, Interglossa was updated and renamed Glosa by Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby. They added more words and made some changes to improve it. Category:Glosa",
