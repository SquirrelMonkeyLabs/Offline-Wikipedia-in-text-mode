It is believed that by meditating and contemplating on the pillars and walls of this temple in honor of the Buddha’s teachings, one can attain the same peace and enlightenment that the Buddha attained. The Pedhama is designed to provide a peaceful environment for those seeking to deepen their understanding of the Buddha’s teachings and cultivate peace of mind and wisdom.
