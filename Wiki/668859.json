 "text": "The Prime Minister of Tuvalu is the head of government of Tuvalu. Because of Tuvalu's constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the Parliament, and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot. Because there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role. After the parliament vote, the Governor-General of Tuvalu must swear in the prime minister. The office of prime minister was created when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978. Several former prime ministers have been appointed the Governor-General of Tuvalu. ==List of prime ministers== No. Name Tenure Tenure Political affiliation Political affiliation No. Name Took office Left office Political affiliation Political affiliation 1 Sir Toaripi Lauti 1 October 1978 8 September 1981 Independent 2 Tomasi Puapua 8 September 1981 16 October 1989 Independent 3 Bikenibeu Paeniu 16 October 1989 10 December 1993 Independent 4 Sir Kamuta Latasi 10 December 1993 24 December 1996 Independent Bikenibeu Paeniu 24 December 1996 27 April 1999 Independent 5 Ionatana Ionatana 27 April 1999 8 December 2000 Independent Lagitupu Tuilimu 8 December 2000 24 February 2001 Independent 6 Faimalaga Luka 24 February 2001 14 December 2001 Independent 7 Koloa Talake 14 December 2001 24 August 2002 Independent 8 Saufatu Sopoanga 24 August 2002 27 August 2004 Independent 9 Maatia Toafa 27 August 2004 14 August 2006 Independent 10 Apisai Ielemia 14 August 2006 29 September 2010 Independent Maatia Toafa 29 September 2010 24 December 2010 Independent 11 Willy Telavi 24 December 2010 1 August 2013 Independent 12 Enele Sopoaga 1 August 2013 19 September 2019 Independent 13 Kausea Natano 19 September 2019 26 February 2024 Independent 14 Feleti Teo 26 February 2024 Incumbent Independent # Tuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana. ==References== *",
