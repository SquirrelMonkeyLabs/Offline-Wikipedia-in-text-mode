 "text": "The Treaty of Troyes (1420) tried to change the inheritance rule for the kings of France, but did not succeed at doing that. This treaty said that Henry V of England and his sons would become kings of France after the death of Charles VI of France. The treaty tried to disinherit the future Charles VII of France. The treaty did not work because Henry V and Charles VI died two months apart and Joan of Arc recaptured land for Charles VII.
