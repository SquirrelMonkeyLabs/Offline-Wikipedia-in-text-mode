 "text": "Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. was an American and global banking company. It was founded in 1847 in Montgomery, Alabama. Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States. It had almost 25,000 employees across the world. It did business in investment banking, private equity, fixed- income, research and private banking. Lehman was in operation until it collapsed in 2008. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Lehman's bankruptcy was the largest in United States history. It was thought to have played a strong role in the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008. The market collapse gave support to the famous \"too big to fail doctrine. Just after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets went down rapidly. A day later, Barclays announced its agreement to buy Lehman's North American investment banking and trading divisions along with its New York City headquarters building. ==References== Category:Defunct companies of the United States Category:Banks based in New York City Category:1844 establishments in the United States Category:2008 disestablishments in the United States",
