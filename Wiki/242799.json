 "text": "The 1955 World Series was played between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Dodgers won the Series in seven games. This was their first championship in team history. It would be the only Series the Dodgers won in Brooklyn. The team moved to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. The last time the Brooklyn team won a World Championship was in 1900. The team was called the Brooklyn Superbas. The series was called the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup. Their opponent then was fellow National League competitor Pittsburgh Pirates. This series would also end a long period of success for the Yankees in the World Series. It was the Yankees' first loss in a World Series since 1942. It was only their second loss since 1926. The Yankees were 15-2 in the series during that time. They would lose again in 1957, 1960, 1963, and 1964. The Yankees would have a record of 4-5 in World Series over the next decade. The two teams were meeting in a World Series for the fifth time in nine years. The Yankees had won in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953.
