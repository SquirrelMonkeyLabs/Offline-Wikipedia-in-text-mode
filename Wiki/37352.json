 "text": "King Bowser Koopa is a character in the Super Mario video games. He is the evil Koopa that takes over the Mushroom Kingdom and kidnaps Princess Peach. He is the main enemy to Mario. He has spikes on his back, breathes fire, and is bigger than normal Koopas. He was ranked #1 in the Top 50 Video Game Villains of all-time list by the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2013. == Video games == Bowser's first appearance was in Super Mario Bros. as the last boss, in the last level. The first seven castles in the game had Bowsers, but they were actually his minions, who were disguised as him. The real Bowser is in the eighth castle, the last one. Bowser's kids, called the Koopalings, were bosses in Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, New Super Mario Bros. Wii, New Super Mario Bros. 2, and New Super Mario Bros. U. However, after Super Mario World, The Koopalings were no longer said to be Bowser's biological kids, since they are now adopted children and Bowser Jr. is now his biological child. In Super Mario World, Bowser appears in a clown car and throws Mecha Koopas. When Mario moved to the Nintendo 64 with Super Mario 64, Bowser was again the main bad guy. In the remake of this game, Super Mario 64 DS, he is fought as a boss three times. He also appears in the Disney movie Wreck-It Ralph. ==References== ==Other websites== *Bowser on Giant Bomb Category:Animated television characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1985 Category:Fictional turtles Category:Mario series characters Category:Video game antagonists Category:Video game bosses Category:Animated movie villains",
