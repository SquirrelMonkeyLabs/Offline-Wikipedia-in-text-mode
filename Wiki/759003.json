In June 2020, the Mayor (Karl Popoff) resigned from a local nonprofit after saying \"Black lives don't matter to Black Lives Matter people ... you can shove your racism bandwagon.\" Popoff had been mayor for 16 years at that time. He apologized for his tone but stood by the content of his message. He said \"Those three words hit me the wrong way\", speaking of Black Lives Matter. Most of city councilors voted to censure the mayor and to stop funding for his projects. One coucilor said \"He doesn’t know what he wrote was wrong.\" ==References== Category:Cities in Oregon Category:County seats in Oregon",
