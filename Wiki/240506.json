 "text": "Sinn Féin is a political party in Ireland. Beginning with the Sinn Féin organisation set up in 1905 by Arthur Griffith, it took its current form in 1970 after a split within the party. The leader of Sinn Féin has been Mary Lou McDonald since February 2018. It is one of the most important parties arguing for a united island of Ireland and is described as left wing. In the past, the party has been linked to the Provisional IRA. The name is Irish for \"ourselves\" or \"we ourselves\", although it is frequently wrongly translated as \"ourselves alone\". Sinn Féin is the second largest party in the parliament of Northern Ireland (the Northern Ireland Assembly), the second largest party in the parliament of the Irish Republic (Dáil Éireann) and has 7 elected members of the British House of Commons, however, party policy is that representatives do not take their seats there.
