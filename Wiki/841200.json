The party supports democratic socialism and social democracy. Alongside the governing People's Action Party, it is one of the oldest parties active in the country, having contested every election since 1959. It was founded by Mr David Marshall on 3 November 1957, and was the first party to win the majority of the votes under Mr Marshall before People's Action Party took over on 30 May 1959. Since then, it still is an active party and one of the three main parties in the Singapore Parliament. == References == Category:1957 establishments in Asia Category:20th-century establishments in Singapore Category:Political parties in Singapore",
