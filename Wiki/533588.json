 "text": "The Tajik language is the official language of Tajikistan. It is a dialect of the Persian language. It was written in the Persian alphabet until 1928. From 1928 to 1939, it was written mostly in the Latin alphabet until the Soviet government forced Tajiks to write their language in Cyrillic in 1939. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Tajik continues to be written in Cyrillic, although now it can also be written in the Latin alphabet. == References == Category:Iranian languages Category:Languages of Tajikistan",
