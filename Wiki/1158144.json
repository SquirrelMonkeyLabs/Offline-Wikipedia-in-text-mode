 "text": "Budhagupta was an emperor of the Gupta dynasty who ruled around 476–495 CE. He succeeded Kumaragupta II and was the son of Purugupta. After Budhagupta's reign, he was succeeded by Narasimhagupta. == Dominions == Two copper-plate inscriptions found in Damodarpur, a village in Dinajpur district, show that Budhagupta’s empire included Pundravardhana Bhukti, which is roughly modern- day North Bengal. This region was governed by his viceroys, Brahmadatta and Jayadatta. The Sarnath Inscription from 476–77 CE, along with the Varanasi Stone Pillar Inscription from 478–79 CE, confirms that Budhagupta also ruled the Kasi region (modern Varanasi). In 484–85 CE, a flagstaff was set up in honor of Vishnu by Matrivishnu, the ruler of Eran, and his brother Dhanyavishnu while Budhagupta was king. During this time, Surashmichandra was in charge of the land between the Yamuna and Narmada rivers. These records show that Budhagupta’s empire included parts of Central India, Kasi, and North Bengal. == References == Category:India Category:Gupta Empire Category:490s deaths Category:Gupta emperors",
