 "text": "Sexual reassignment surgery (SRS) is also called gender reassignment surgery, sex reassignment surgery or a sex change. SRS is one or more surgeries that are done to change the body's genitals or other sexual characteristrics. Transgender people may get SRS to make their body match their gender identity. There are many different kinds of surgeries that fall under the category of \"sexual reassignment surgery.\" For transgender women (\"male-to-female\" transgender people), some types of sexual reassignment surgery are: *Phallectomy (removing the penis) *Orchiectomy (removing the testicles) *Vaginoplasty (where a surgeon creates a vagina) *Breast implants *Voice therapy For transgender men (\"female-to-male\" transgender people), some types of SRS are: *Mastectomy (removing the breasts) *Hysterectomy (removing the uterus) *Phalloplasty (where a surgeon creates a penis; however, this surgery is more difficult and dangerous than vaginoplasty for transgender women) Transgender people may get one of these surgeries, a combination, or no surgeries at all. Every person is different. Some international laws on human rights cover SRS. For example, the Declaration of Montreal and the Yogyakarta Principles say that transgender people must be allowed SRS. These laws say that if health insurance companies did not cover SRS, they would be discriminating against transgender people. In 1972, Sweden became the first country to let transgender people change their legal gender after surgery and offer free treatment for gender reassignment. Singapore followed in 1973, becoming the first in Asia to do so. ==Related pages== *Transsexualism *Sex assignment *Body modification ==References== Category:Surgery category:Transgender",
