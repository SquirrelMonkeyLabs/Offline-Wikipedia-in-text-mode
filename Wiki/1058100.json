This was the first time that a professional wrestling weekly program was shown on TNT since WCW Monday Nitro from World Championship Wrestling (WCW) ended on March 26, 2001. Livestreaming would be streamed on B/R Live. In August 2019, WWE announced that they would be moving NXT in the same time slot as Dynamite, which would have them end up competing with each other and would help usher in the Wednesday Night Wars. An average of 1.409 million viewers tuned into the debut episode of Dynamite. This was the largest television debut on TNT in the last five years. The war ended when WWE announced that they were moving NXT to Tuesdays on April 13, 2021. On January 5, 2022, Dynamite moved networks from TNT to TBS. ==Commentator history== Commentators Dates Jim Ross, Excalibur, and Tony Schiavone – Jim Ross and Excalibur Jim Ross, Excalibur, and Taz (2nd hour) (1st hour) – (2nd hour) Tony Schiavone, Cody, and Kenny Omega Tony Schiavone and Cody (1st hour) Tony Schiavone and Colt Cabana (2nd hour) Tony Schiavone and Chris Jericho – Jim Ross, Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, and Chris Jericho (1st hour) – Jim Ross, Excalibur, and Chris Jericho (2nd hour) Jim Ross, Tony Schiavone, and Taz – Jim Ross, Tony Schiavone, and Chris Jericho Jim Ross, Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, and CM Punk (1st hour) Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, Adam Page, MJF, and Taz Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, and Taz – – (1st hour) – present Jim Ross, Excalibur, Taz, and William Regal (2nd hour) Jim Ross, Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, and Taz – Excalibur and Taz Excalibur, Taz, and Jim Ross December 20, 2023 Excalibur, Taz, and Ian Riccaboni January 17, 2024 Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, and Don Callis May 8, 2024 Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, and Nigel McGuinness July 10, 2024 ==References== == Other websites == * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:All Elite Wrestling",
