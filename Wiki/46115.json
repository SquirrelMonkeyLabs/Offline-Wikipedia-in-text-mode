 "text": "Player Killing (PKing) is a part of online gaming with real people. It is when you kill another person's character. Some other terms in pking are: PJing, which means pile jumping, or attacking someone when they are picking up the items dropped by a player they have just killed a player, Safer, which means someone who PKs safely (especially when eating or healing) and does not take risks, making it widely considered 'unfair' on the people trying to PK them and DD which means death dot, which is when people in a Player Killing team all stand in the same place as each other, making it appear to other players that there is only one person there. However, \"safing\" varies in how other people perceive it. It can be used to stay alive, however you usually lose a chance to hit when healing. ==References== Category:Video game terminology en:Player versus player#Player killing",
