Wild turkeys prefer hardwood and mixed conifer-hardwood forests with scattered openings such as pastures, fields, orchards and seasonal marshes. They can adapt to any dense plant community so long as there is cover and openings to fly out. Open, mature forests with a variety of tree species seem to be best. The domesticated turkey has been tamed and bred from wild turkeys, by people, to raise on farms. == References == Category:Birds of North America Category:Turkeys Category:Symbols of Oklahoma",
