 "text": "Super Bowl XLVII (meaning Super Bowl 47 in Roman numerals) was a Super Bowl game in which the Baltimore Ravens, winners of the American Football Conference (AFC) for the 2012 season, beat the San Francisco 49ers, winners of the National Football Conference (NFC) for the 2012 season, 34â€“31 to become winners of National Football League (NFL) for the 2012 season. The game was played on February 3, 2013 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The win gave the Ravens their second Super Bowl title and their first since the 2000 NFL season at Super Bowl XXXV. Joe Flacco was named the Super Bowl MVP. The game was also nicknamed the Harbaugh Bowl, HarBowl and Brother Bowl because it was the first Super Bowl that featured two brothers as opposing head coaches with both Baltimore's John Harbaugh and San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh facing each other. The game also marked Ray Lewis' last NFL game after he said that he was going to retire from professional football at the end of the 2012 season. ==References== *047 Category:2013 in sports Category:Baltimore Ravens Category:San Francisco 49ers Category:2010s in New Orleans Category:2010s in Louisiana Category:February 2013 events Category:2013 in the United States",
