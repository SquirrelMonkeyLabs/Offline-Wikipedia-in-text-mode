 "text": "The \"Himno de Aragón\" () is the anthem of Aragon. ==Lyrics== Spanish original Aragonese (unofficial) Catalan (unofficial) Poetic English translation I Time hath to dream's edge taken us, A new day from the sun spreadeth its wings. Draw back the clouds, oh drums of north wind, May our voice to the heights ascend. Past centuries marked out thy destiny, Thee which calleth to freedom and justice. Thy fields shall sprout upwards into to sky With the green spike, the gold clusters, The imperishable olive tree of peace. Light of Aragon, tower in the wind, bell of solitude! May thy zeal spread, a river without bounds … thy reason, thy truth! Victory o'er much oblivion, memory of eternity, Of men and women aplenty, Aragon, live on! Time shineth And age arriveth So long rock with water floweth. To link our lives, To modulate our voices. II From the white peaks where snow sleepeth, To red plains by blue air sway'd. A clear sky with its face in water kindleth, Its crowns radiant with light. Let's open the windows so that night shall sing, To the rhythm of life in a ring of love; Souls shall embrace caught by dawn. May hope shine, may roads open wholeheartedly into the land. Open land, folk grand, o Aragon! My homeland, my homeland, Aragon! ==Related pages== * Canto a la libertad, a song widely known as the unofficial anthem of Aragon ==References== Category:Aragon Category:Spanish anthems",
