Stickler in the early 1960s. It affects the way a person produces collagen. When someone has Stickler's they may have problems with their joints, eyes, ears, heart, and in some rare cases their skin. Stickler syndrome affects around 1 in 10,000 people. There are six types of Stickler syndrome known, and each has its own gene. Some people may live long and productive lives if the condition is discovered early on. Category:Genetic disorders Category:Ophthalmology Category:Rheumatology Category:Syndromes",
