 "text": "On April 11, 2021 at around 2:00 p.m. EST, Daunte Wright (October 27, 2000 â€” April 11, 2021), a 20-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota as he attempted to re-enter his vehicle during a traffic stop. Wright drove several blocks before crashing his vehicle into another and was pronounced dead at the scene. The shooting sparked protests and demonstrations around the city, including looting and arson, leading to a city-wide curfew. The shooting occurred just 10 miles from the scene of the killing of George Floyd a year prior. == Incident == At around 2:00 local time on April 11, 2021, Brooklyn Center police pulled over Daunte Wright for having air freshener hanging from the rear-view mirror. During the stop, officers determined that Wright had an outstanding warrant and tried to detain him. Wright attempted to re-enter his vehicle and was shot by one of the officers. Wright drove away in his vehicle, making it a few blocks away before colliding with another vehicle. Officers administered CPR, but Wright was subsequently declared dead at the scene. A female passenger in the vehicle, Wright's girlfriend, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. == Protests and violence == Following the shooting, mourners and protesters gathered near the scene, demanding justice for Wright. Police with riot control equipment attempted to restrain the crowd of several hundred people outside of a police precinct. Some in the crowd became unruly, hurling projectiles such as rocks at officers. There was also looting and arson, as more than 20 businesses were damaged in the riot, and police vehicles were vandalized as well. === Response === Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott issued a city-wide curfew until 6:00 a.m. the following morning and local schools were closed, with students instead attending virtually. The National Guard was activated to assist with dispelling the violence. == References == Category:2021 in the United States Category:2020s in Minnesota Category:People shot and killed by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Black Lives Matter",
