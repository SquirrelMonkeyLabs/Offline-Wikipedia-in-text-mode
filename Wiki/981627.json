 "text": "The Naxalbari Uprising was a West Bengali peasant revolt in India in 1967. It inspired the creation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). ==Origin== In the 1960s, the Soviet Union and Communist China weren’t getting along anymore. So a man by the name of Charu Majumdar decided that it was a good time to lead a revolt that was based on Mao’s revolution in China. ==History== From 1965 to 1966, Communists got control of Naxalbari, a region in West Bengal. But they didn’t appoint peasants to as ministers. So in March 1967, the peasants started a violent uprising. The government sent the police to deal with it so the rebels killed one of them. Then the police shot and killed nine women and one child. Then the revolt got worse. Then the government sent the paramilitary to crush the rebellion and it did. They arrested its leader Jangal Santhal while its other leader Charu Majumdar ran away and the other rebel leaders were all killed. Category:1967 in Asia",
