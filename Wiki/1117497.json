 "text": "Qalaat al-Shaghur () is a medieval castle that is part of Al-Shaghur-Bakas complex. It was built on an altitude of on a strategic terrain between Antioch, Apamea, Latakia and Aleppo. The complex is located near the modern village of Shughur Qadim, northwestern of Jisr al-Shughur. ==History== The castle was originally inhabited by Arameans, as evidenced by inscriptions on the site's walls. Subsequently, it came under the control of the Palmyreans, Thamudis, and Romans. The northern end of the site was fortified during the Byzantine period. After the First Crusade, the site became part of the Principality of Antioch and was defended by the Knights Hospitaller, until Saladin captured it in August 1188. According to Ibn al-Athir, the garrison surrendered upon the arrival of the Muslims, while Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad attributed the capitulation to the use of artillery. The site suffered extensive damage during the Mongol invasions of the Levant in 1260 but was later rebuilt during the reign of Baybars. Earthquakes in 1408, and 1735 caused significant structural damage. ==Features== According to Yaqut al- Hamawi, al-Shaghur to the north and Bakas to the south formed a double castle complex divided by a wide fosse. A tunnel, discovered by Max van Berchem, connected it to Antioch. Al-Shaghur-Bakas complex, possibly known as La Garde, featured wells linked to the Nahr al-Abyad (a tributary of the Orontes River) and nearby springs. Stones engraved with the name of Ayyubid emir Az-Zahir Ghazi were also found at the site. ==Related pages== *List of Crusader castles ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:Castles",
