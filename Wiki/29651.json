 "text": "Cleopatra Philopator (Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Φιλοπάτωρ) 69 BC – 10 August, 30 BC, was Queen of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. She was its last active ruler. She was one of the most famous women in history. Her full name was Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator. She was the last of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Pharaohs set up in Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great. After her death, Egypt became the Roman province of Aegyptus. The main historical source for her life is Plutarch's Life of Antony, available in translations.Bradford, Ernle Dusgate Selby 2000. Cleopatra. Penguin Group. Antony and Cleopatra is the famous tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written sometime between 1603 and 1607. It was first printed in 1623. == Early life of Cleopatra == Cleopatra VII was born in 69 BC in Alexandria, Egypt to Ptolemy XII, the pharaoh of Egypt, and his wife, Queen Cleopatra V Tryphaena. Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic royal family which was famous for only marrying between their family members. Cleopatra took education in math, science, astronomy, and religion and politics. Cleopatra spoke Egyptian, Greek, and Latin very well and she was known as a smart person and a great politician. In the beginning, Cleopatra faced a lot of problems. Her father, Ptolemy XII, was an unpopular pharaoh whom Egyptians didn’t like. He died in 51 BC, and Cleopatra’s little brother Ptolemy XIII, who was just ten years old at the time, became the king. But Ptolemy XIII was too young to rule on his own, so Cleopatra ruled jointly with him. == Caesar and Pompey == At that time, two Roman generals were fighting to be the leaders of the Roman Republic. They were Pompey and Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar defeated Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus in Greece, 48 BC. Pompey fled to Egypt from Pharsalus, and was murdered by the orders of Ptolemy. Ptolemy and his supporters thought Caesar would be pleased, but that was a big mistake. Caesar had pardoned many of the senators who fought against him. His reason was to lay the ground for peace in Rome. The murder of Pompey cut right across Caesar's plans. Worse, Pompey was a Roman consul, and the widower of Caesar's only daughter, Julia. Worse still, Pompey was beheaded in front of his fifth wife and children, who were on the ship from which he had just disembarked. This made sure that Pompey's powerful family and supporters would never forget, and would always be enemies of Caesar. Then Caesar came to Alexandria, the capital of Egypt. Economically, Egypt was a bread-basket which could feed the people of Rome. Popular mythology has it that Cleopatra received Caesar in her own unique way. She lay down on a carpet. Then her servants rolled up the carpet with Cleopatra inside. Then the carpet was taken to the palace where Caesar was staying. The guards saw some people carrying a carpet and they did not stop them. They carried the carpet to Caesar. Then Cleopatra came out of the carpet. Caesar fell in love with her and they became lovers. At the time, Cleopatra was 21 years old and Caesar was 52 years old. Caesar decided to make Cleopatra queen again. Ptolemy did not like that. There was fighting, but Caesar won. Ptolemy tried to leave, but he fell in the river Nile and drowned. Another younger brother became king, but Cleopatra was again the real leader of Egypt. Cleopatra did not marry Julius Caesar, but they did have a son. He was called Caesarion. Soon after Caesarion was born, Caesar was murdered as he walked to the Senate in Rome. Cleopatra and her entourage were in Rome when Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BC. Cleopatra fled back to Egypt. == Mark Antony and Octavian == Mark Antony, who was Caesar's military commander, and Octavian, Caesar's legal heir, defeated the group who had conspired against Caesar. This group was led by Brutus and Cassius, who took their army to the Eastern Mediterranean, and controlled much of that area. The issue was finally settled by the Battle of Philippi, fought in Macedonia. Caesar's place was taken by three joint Consuls, the Second Triumvirate. Their names were Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus. Lepidus was a minor character, and the long-term fate of the Empire was decided by a conflict between Antony and Octavian. Mark Antony came to see Cleopatra, and they fell in love, though Antony already had a wife. Cleopatra had three more children. Two were twins, and the father of all three was Mark Antony. The conflict between Octavian and Antony became serious, and soon there was war. Cleopatra was wealthy, and she used her money to help Antony. But Octavian won the war. He became the ruler of the Roman Empire and was known as Augustus or Caesar Augustus. He took control of Egypt from Cleopatra. After her kingdom was conquered, she committed suicide by letting an asp (a poisonous snake bite her. Antony had already committed suicide. Caesarion was murdered by Octavian, and her other children were taken as prisoners to Rome. Two of them died of illness, but her daughter, Cleopatra Selene II, married an African King Juba II of Numidia. The couple were sent to Mauritania to rule by Octavian. They lived a full life there, and had children.Roller D.W. 2003. The world of Juba II and Kleopatra Selene: royal scholarship on Rome's African frontier. Routledge, London.The ancient kingdom of Mauretania was not on the Atlantic coast south of Western Sahara, where modern Mauritania lies. It was a Berber kingdom in what is now Algeria. There are many stories told of how rich Cleopatra was, but we cannot be sure if these are true. For example, one story says that she took baths in milk, to make her skin softer. Another story says that she made a bet with Antony that she could make the most expensive meal ever. To win the bet, she took a pearl earring, dissolved it in vinegar, and drank it. == Related pages == *Cleopatra (1963 movie) *Antony and Cleopatra *216 Kleopatra ==References== ===Sources=== ====Online==== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==== Sources ==== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * . * * * * * * * * * * * . * * * * * * * * * * * * . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1st millennium BC pharaohs Category:Ptolemaic Egypt",
