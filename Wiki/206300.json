 "text": "The Wales football team is the football team of Wales or the Welsh football team. Unlike England and Scotland, the Welsh football team is not the most followed version of the game. In Wales, the Welsh rugby team is the most followed. In this circumstance, it is not surprising that the Welsh football team is usually ranked lower than the English and Scottish teams. Recently, the team has been more highly ranked. The team recorded the biggest rise in the history of the FIFA World Rankings, moving from 117th in 2011 to 8th place in 2015. They are also the smallest nation by population to ever reach the semi-finals of the UEFA European Championship, after reaching the UEFA Euro 2016 semi-finals. In April 2017, Jess Fishlock became the first player to earn 100 caps for the Wales national football team. ==Most appearances== ===Men's team=== Rank Player Years Caps Goals 1 Gareth Bale 2006–2022 111 41 2 Chris Gunter 2007–2022 109 0 Wayne Hennessey 2007–present 109 0 4 Neville Southall 1982–1997 92 0 5 Ashley Williams 2008–2019 86 2 Ben Davies 2012–present 86 2 6 Gary Speed 1990–2004 85 7 8 Aaron Ramsey 2008–present 84 21 9 Craig Bellamy 1998–2013 78 19 10 Joe Ledley 2005–2018 77 4 ===Women's team=== # Player Years Caps Goals 1 Jess Fishlock 2006–present 149 42 2 Sophie Ingle 2009–present 120 3 3 Loren Dykes 2007–2021 105 3 4 Helen Ward 2008–2023 105 44 5 Angharad James 2011–present 102 4 6 Tash Harding 2008–present 100 26 ==Top scorers== ===Men's team=== (players still active in bold): # Name Goals Matches Average 1 Gareth Bale 41 111 2 Ian Rush 28 73 3 Trevor Ford 23 38 Ivor Allchurch 23 68 5 Dean Saunders 22 75 6 Aaron Ramsey 21 84 7 Craig Bellamy 19 78 8 Robert Earnshaw 16 59 Cliff Jones 16 59 Mark Hughes 16 72 ===Women's team=== (players still active in bold): # Name Goals Matches Average 1 Helen Ward 44 105 2 Jess Fishlock 42 149 ==Managers== Prior to 1954 the Welsh team was chosen by a panel of selectors with the team captain fulfilling the role of coach.
