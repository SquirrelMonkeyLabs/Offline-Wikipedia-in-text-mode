 "text": "Since the show started in 1964, there were various songs and arrangements that were used as the show's main theme. Most of these were composed by Merv Griffin. The best known theme song is \"Think!\". It has served as the countdown music for the Final Jeopardy! round since 1964. Between 1964 and 1975, a jazz tune called \"Take Ten\", composed by Julann Griffin, served as the main theme. When the series was revived in 1978, \"January, February, March\" served as the opening theme, and \"Frisco Disco\" served as the closing theme, both of which were composed by Merv Griffin himself. \"January, February, March\" was also used in the first pilot of the syndicated version. Beginning with the Alex Trebek hosted syndicated version in September 1984, a rendition of \"Think!\" served as the show's main theme. The original version of the main theme consisted of saxophones and synthesizers along with the original recording of \"Think!\" retained for the final segment. A swooshing sound effect was added during the show's introduction. In 1992, the main theme was remixed to include congas. It was used for tournaments in Season 8, and then it was put permanently into use in Season 9. In 1997, both the main theme and \"Think!\" music were rearranged by Steve Kaplan. They both involved a more piano-driven, orchestral, jazzy sound. In 2001, the 1997 theme was rearranged, and its tempo increased. In 2008, Chris Bell Music & Sound Design overhauled the Jeopardy! music package for the showâ€™s 25th anniversary. And in 2021, Bleeding Fingers Music rearranged the 2008 theme. Category:Jeopardy!",
