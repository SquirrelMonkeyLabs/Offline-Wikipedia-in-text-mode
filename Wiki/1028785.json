A 1998 Radio Times readers' poll voted it the \"best single television drama\" and a 2000 industry poll rated it as the second-best British television programme ever made. Filmed in a gritty, realistic drama documentary style, it was first seen on 16 November 1966 in the BBC's The Wednesday Play slot, which often tackled social issues. ==References== Category:BBC Television programmes Category:1966 works Category:Housing in the United Kingdom Category:1960s plays",
