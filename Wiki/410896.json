 "text": "Ugni is a genus of plants of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae). Four species belong to this genus, all from western America. ==Description== They are small evergreen shrubs. The leaves are simple, entire, opposite, elliptical; they are 1–2 cm long and 0.2-2.5 cm broad, dark green, and with a spicy scent if broken into many small pieces. The solitary flowers are usually hanging; they are 1–2 cm diameter with four or five white or pale pink petals and many short stamens. The fruit is a small red or purple berry, 1 cm in diameter, with many seeds. ==Name== The name comes from Uñi with which the Mapuches (native people from south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina) name the fruits of the best known species of the genus, Ugni molinae. The genus was formerly often included in either Myrtus or Eugenia; it is distinguished from these two genera by the hanging flowers with stamens shorter than the petals. The Russian botanist Nicolai Stepanowitsch Turczaninow created the genus Ugni in 1849. ==Where it grows== All species of this genus are found in western South and Central America, native from southern Mexico to central southern Chile and Argentina. ==Species== There are four species in this genus:' * Ugni candollei (Barnéoud) O.Berg: Chile * Ugni molinaeTurcz.: Chile and Argentina * Ugni myricoides (Kunth) O.Berg: Southern Mexico, Central America to Bolivia, Venezuela and northern Brazil * Ugni selkirkii (Hook. & Arn.) O.Berg: Endemic species of the Juan Fernández Islands, Chile ==Uses== Ugni molinae is grown as an ornamental plant and for its edible fruits; these fruits are also used to make jams. ==References== ==Other websites== * Ugni in Encyclopedia of the Chilean Flora * Ugni molinae at ChileBosque * Flora of Chile: Ugni * Trees and shrubs of Ecuador: Ugni Category:Shrubs Category:Myrtaceae",
