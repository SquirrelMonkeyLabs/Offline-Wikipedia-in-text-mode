The Richter scale was adopted in 1935, and was used in the above table also about earlier earthquakes at a merely indicative title. Earthquakes' effects were once measured after the Mercalli scale, which regards the practical damages that a seismic event causes to infrastructures and houses, and a sort of comparison between the two scale is now in use, especially for ancient events. == Other websites == *USGS list of current earthquakes *Earthquakes Canada *Recent New Zealand earthquakes * Category:Science-related lists",
