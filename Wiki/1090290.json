 "text": "Frotteurism (or frotteuristic disorder), is the interest in touching or groping other people's bodies without their consent. This is done for sexual pleasure. It usually involves rubbing the genital area against a stranger. A person who does this kind of act is called a frotteur. Frotteurs often commit their acts in public places, especially ones where the victim cannot easily react or leave (like on a crowded train or in a crowd at a concert). Frotteurism is a kind of paraphilia. A paraphilia is when someone gets very sexually aroused by something considered unusual. Paraphilias often involve things or people who do not consent to being involved. This can be sexual assault, which is a crime in most countries. == Origin == The exact cause of frotteuristic disorder is not known. However, many theories exist. Psychoanalysts propose that people with the disorder may have unmet needs to cuddle, like a baby does with their mother. They might imagine that they have a close relationship with their non-consenting victims during the act. Kurt Freund suggests that people with the disorder have problems with the tactile interactions they might experience during normal human erotic or sexual interactions. Some research has suggested that there could be a biological cause of abnormal sexual behaviors such as frotteurism. == Prevalence == The prevalence of frotteuristic disorder (how common it is) is not known because it's hard for scientists to research. People with the disorder rarely seek treatment for themselves because of shame or guilt. Also, when an act is committed in a crowded public place, it can be difficult to identify who did it. A wide prevalence range between 9% and 35% has been found across different scientific studies. Most frotteurs are men, often those between 15 to 25 years old. Individual acts of frotteurism (like touching, groping, and rubbing) may be done by up to 30% of men. Most victims are women. In a study of young female passengers on public trains in Tokyo, more than 66% reported that they had been subject to acts of frotteurism. == Treatment == The recommended treatment for frotteurism involves multiple elements. It combines therapy, support, and potentially medication. The kinds of therapy which have shown success include psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and psychoanalysis. Medication which reduces or suppresses sex drive may be used in severe cases. == References == Category:Paraphilias Category:Sexual fetishism",
