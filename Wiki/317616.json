 "text": "Tropical Storm Hermine (also known as Tropical Depression 11-E in the eastern Pacific) was an unusual basin crossing tropical cyclone. The storm struck near Salina Cruz, Mexico before weakening into a low pressure system. It moved north, became Tropical Storm Hermine, intensified and then struck northeastern Mexico. Hermine continued north into Texas and Oklahoma, where it then fizzled out. From Guatemala to Oklahoma, the cyclone killed over 100 people and caused $740 million in damage, 240 million in the United States. Despite the devastation, the name Hermine wasn't retired.
