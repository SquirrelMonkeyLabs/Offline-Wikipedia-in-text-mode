 "text": "Gale Eugene Sayers (May 30, 1943 - September 23, 2020), nicknamed the \"Kansas Comet\", was an American football player. He earned fame both as a halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In a brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. Prior to joining the Bears, he played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks football team of the University of Kansas, where he compiled 4,020 all-purpose yards over three seasons and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American. Sayers was born in Wichita, Kansas. He was raised in Omaha, Nebraska. He studied at the University of Kansas. In 2012, Sayers was diagnosed with dementia after suffering multiple concussions during his football career. Sayers died from problems caused by dementia on September 23, 2020 in Wakarusa, Indiana at the age of 77. ==References== ==Other websites== * Sayers Technology, LLC â€“ Sayers-owned technology consulting firm Category:1943 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from dementia Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Sportspeople from Wichita, Kansas Category:Sportspeople from Omaha, Nebraska",
