 "text": "Holly is a type of bush with recognisable leaves. The leaves have sharp edges, and are often used to decorate a house on Christmas Day. Some types of holly are used to make tea. The leaves of the Holly don't fall of in the winter because they're very thick and have a waxy layer on them. Holly bushes produce berries that birds often eat during the winter season. The plant often signifies holidays such as Christmas, or the start of a new season. Category:Christmas Category:Asterids",
