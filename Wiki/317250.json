 "text": "White asbestos, also called chrysotile asbestos or serpentine asbestos, is one of the six types of asbestos. About 95% of asbestos found in buildings is white asbestos. It is considered by experts to be less dangerous than the other types of asbestos, but it is still a major health hazard and exposure can cause cancer and asbestosis. Chrysotile should not be confused with chrysolite, which refers to peridot and several other non-asbestos-like minerals. == References == Category:Asbestos",
