 "text": "The Legacy was an evil professional wrestling stable in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which competed on their Raw brand from 2008 to 2010. Led by Randy Orton, its members were Ted DiBiase, Jr., Cody Rhodes, Sim Snuka and Manu. The stable was founded at Night of Champions when Rhodes turned on Hardcore Holly forming the Priceless with Ted DiBiase Jr. As part of the stable, Orton held the WWE Championship three times, while Rhodes and Ted DiBiase held the World Tag Team Championship twice. == History == === Roots (2007–2008) === The roots of the team started December 10 2007, on the Raw 15th anniversary, when Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship. They retained the championship in many matches, against fellow tag-teams such as Carlito and Santino Marella, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In 2008, Rhodes and Holly then entered a feud with DiBiase and his mystery partner, when he and his father, \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, Sr., appeared in a segment on Raw. They, challenged Rhodes and Holly to a title match at Night of Champions against DiBiase (Jr.) and a mystery partner which they accepted. At the event, DiBiase came to the ring without a partner and said his partner would be there. However, the bell rang and there was no partner for it to be a two on one handicap match. DiBiase demanded that he faced Holly first and as DiBiase approached Holly, Holly was attacked by his tag team partner Rhodes, revealing that he was DiBiase's tag team partner, turning Rhodes heel and in the process, Rhodes and DiBiase became the new tag team champions. After holding the titles for just over a month, they lost them to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 edition of Raw. The following week, DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to win back the title. Rhodes and DiBiase were joined by Manu, forming a stable of multi-generational superstars. On October 27, 2008, Rhodes and DiBiase lost their titles to Kofi Kingston and CM Punk. During this time, Rhodes, DiBiase and Manu entered a storyline with Randy Orton where Orton constantly criticized and insulted them, and attacked DiBiase on November 7, punting him in the head. At Survivor Series, Rhodes, along with Orton, was a sole survivor for Orton's team in the Elimination match. === The Legacy (2008–2010) === Rhodes and Manu accepted Orton's offer to form an alliance a few weeks after the \"DiBiase incident\"; attacking John Cena along with Chris Jericho, and the trio called themselves \"The Legacy\"; debuting the following week in a 2-on-3 handicap match against Batista and WWE Champion Triple H, and although they were now a stable, neither one of the three made any changes in their attire. On December 15 they defeated Batista and World Heavyweight Champion John Cena in a match where Orton punted Batista in the head, leaving him indefinitely inactive (actually due to a torn hamstring), also that night Rhodesand Manu interfered in Rey Mysterio's match against Sim Snuka, giving a beating to Rey, who was later attacked by Mike Knox. The following week, Orton qualified for a Fatal Four Way Elimination Match, his opponent being Batista (who was unable to compete), while the same night, Manu lost to Kofi Kingston in a singles match with Rhodes at ringside. After Orton grew tired of losing matches, he informed Rhodes, Snuka and Manu that that very night they would have to complete their first test. Each man would have to compete in a singles match. Each man who won would have completed “step one,” any man who lost would be out of his Legacy; the only man that lost was Manu. On January 5, 2009, Cody Rhodes and Sim Snuka competed against Cryme Tyme for \"step two\". They won the match when Rhodes pinned JTG. However, Since it was Rhodes who scored the pinfall victory in the match and not Snuka, Orton declared that Snuka was out and that Rhodes was in for good. The following week, Snuka and Manu wanted to attack Orton, along with the returning DiBiase, giving Rhodes the chance to join them. As they ambushed Orton, DiBiase and Rhodes instead sided with Orton and attacked Snuka and Manu. DiBiase then oficially joined The Legacy. Stephanie McMahon announced that Orton, Rhodes and DiBiase would participate in the Royal Rumble. On January 25, 2009, Orton won the Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Triple H, and therefore won the traditional shot for a world championship at WrestleMania XXV. Orton opened Raw the night after the Royal Rumble with Rhodes and DiBiase, as well as two lawyers and a therapist. He followed to reveal that he (kayfabe) suffered from IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder, a mental condition that caused him to become violent when he was angry, losing all control of his emotions and actions). According to Orton and his therapist, WWE knew of the condition, and if he was fired, Orton said that he planned on not only taking Rhodes and DiBiase with him, but also on bringing a lawsuit against the company. He then detailed his plans for a second lawsuit, wanting to leave WWE if he would not get his title match at WrestleMania. At the end of the show, Stephanie McMahon entered the ring, expressing her wish to speak to Randy Orton face-to-face. Orton went even further, threatening to stop WrestleMania. Shane McMahon made his entrance, and attacked Orton until he was stopped by the whole Raw roster. The following week Orton challenged Shane to a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which Shane accepted. Orton won the match at the event. He then went on to feud with WWE Champion Triple H. On the March 2 edition of Raw, Orton chose Triple H for his match at WrestleMania. At the event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton after hitting him with a sledgehammer and a Pedigree. The following night, Orton had a one on one match with Mr. McMahon, just as Orton was about to go for the punt kick, Shane McMahon came to the aid of his father; this made Rhodes and DiBiase attack Shane; which then lead to Triple H coming out. As Legacy were attacking Triple H, Batista returned to attack Orton for what he did to him in December. At Backlash, The Legacy defeated Batista, Shane McMahon and Triple H in a six-man tag team match for the WWE Championship. Later that year, Legacy feuded with D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels). In 2010 at the Royal Rumble, DiBiase and Rhodes accidentally cost Orton his chance to win the WWE Championship from Sheamus. On February 21, Orton and DiBiase entered the Elimination Chamber match at the first ever Elimination Chamber pay-per-view. DiBiase eliminated Orton from the match, but was evenutally eliminated by Kofi Kingston. The next night on Raw, The Legacy broke up after Orton turned on DiBiase and Rhodes. The three competed in a Triple Threat match at WrestleMania XXVI, which was won by Orton. === Short Priceless reunion (2011) === Cody Rhodes teamed with Ted DiBiase on the May 20, 2011 episode of SmackDown, and they went on to feud with Sin Cara and Daniel Bryan. In August, Rhodes attacked DiBiase after DiBiase lost a match to Orton. DiBiase challenged Rhodes for his Intercontinental Championship at Night of Champions but lost the match. == Championships and accomplishments == * World Wrestling Entertainment ** WWE Championship (3 times) - Orton ** World Tag Team Championship (2 times) - Rhodes and DiBiase ** Royal Rumble (2009) - Orton == References == == Other websites == * Randy Orton's WWE profile * Cody Rhodes' WWE profile * Ted DiBiase's WWE profile * The Legacy's profile at Cagematch.net Category:WWE teams and stables",
