The city's population is 321,992. It is the 42nd-largest city and the oldest European settlement in United States territory. Today, San Juan is Puerto Rico's most important seaport. == History == San Juan was founded in 1521. It was named after San Juan Bautista, or St. John the Baptist (name given by Christopher Columbus). San Juan is also known as \"La Ciudad Amurallada\". This means the \"walled city\". Many Spanish explorers came during the Age of Discovery and built forts, churches, and other historical buildings. \"La Fortaleza\" (also known as \"Palacio de Santa Catalina\") is an example of a very old fort in San Juan. In the sixteenth century, San Juan was a Spanish fortress against Caribs. (These were the people native to the Caribbean islands and Central America.) San Juan has many old buildings still standing today. One is is the Casas de los Contrasfuertes (House of Buttresses), the oldest residence in Old San Juan. == References == Category:Cities in Puerto Rico Category:Municipalities of Puerto Rico Category:United States capital cities Category:1521 establishments Category:1520s establishments in North America Category:Establishments in Puerto Rico",
