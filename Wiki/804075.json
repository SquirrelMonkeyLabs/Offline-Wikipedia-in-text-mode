 "text": "Jang Song-thaek was a North Korean politician and general. Jang was the uncle of the Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un through his marriage to Kim Jong-il's sister. During the final years of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il's life, Jang Song-thaek was believed to be the de facto ruler of North Korea until Kim-Jong un became Supreme Leader in 2011. Jong and his wife had a daughter who was born in 1977. She went to study in Paris but refused to return to North Korea and killed herself in 2006. In December 2013, the North Korean government accused Jang Song-thaek of not being loyal to the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un (Jong Sang-Thaek's nephew). Jong Sang-thaek was then executed by shooting on the orders of Kim Jong-un. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:2013 deaths Category:North Korean people Category:People executed by firearm",
