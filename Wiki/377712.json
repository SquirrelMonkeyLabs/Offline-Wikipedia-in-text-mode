 "text": "Prior to World War II the Medal of Honor could be received for actions not involving direct combat with the enemy; 193 men earned the medal in this way. Most of the peacetime medals were presented to members of the United States Navy for their actions during boiler explosions, man-overboard incidents, and other hazards of naval service. Given in the list below are the place and date of each recipient's Medal of Honor action, as well as their rank at the time of the action. A posthumous recipient is denoted by an asterisk after the recipient's name. ==Medal of Honor== The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously). A Medal of Honor during peacetime has not been presented since 1939. ==List of recipients== :Note: Notes in quotations are derived or are copied from the official Medal of Honor citation Image Name Service Rank Place of action Date of action Notes Navy For lifesaving heroism during boiler malfunction Navy For rescuing from drowning W.
