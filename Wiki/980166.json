 "text": "Aplastodiscus eugenioi is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 300 meters above sea level. It lives near the ocean and on three islands. The adult male frog is 31 - 36 mm long from nose to rear end and adult female frog is 36 - 39 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is green in color. It has brown or light brown spots. The frog has a light brown stripe from its eye and another stripe from the eye to the front leg. The skin of the belly is yellow in color. There is blue color on the throat and part of the belly. The webbed skin on the toes is green in color. The iris of the eye is orange with white marks. During the day, the adult frogs hide in bromeliad plants or in leaves. At night, the male frogs sit on tree branches near streams and the sing for the females. The tadpoles stay near the bottom of the water by small rocks or sand. The tadpoles are mostly active at night. There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives to make room for farms, towns, and places for animals to eat grass. Chemicals made to kill pests, fertilizers, pollution, and diseases can also kill this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
