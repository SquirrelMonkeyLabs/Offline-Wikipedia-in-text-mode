 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Aude department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of the Aude are: # Arrondissement of Carcassonne, (prefecture: Carcassonne), with 207 communes. # Arrondissement of Limoux, (subprefecture: Limoux), with 147 communes. # Arrondissement of Narbonne, (subprefecture: Narbonne), with 82 communes. ==History== Since its creation, the Aude department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the department with six districts: Carcassonne, Castelnaudary, Lagrasse, Limoux, Narbonne and Quillan; the capital was Carcassonne. * 1800 : creation of four arrondissements: Carcassonne (including the old district of Lagrasse), Castelnaudary, Limoux (including the old district of Quillan) and Narbonne. * 1926 : the arrondissement of Castelnaudary was eliminated and was made part of the arrondissement of Carcassonne. ==Related pages== *Arrondissement of Carcassonne *Arrondissement of Limoux *Arrondissement of Narbonne *List of arrondissements of France ==References== Aude",
