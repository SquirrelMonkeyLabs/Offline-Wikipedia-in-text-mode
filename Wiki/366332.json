He was the first Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland. Before that, he was the ninth Proprietary Governor of the Colony of Newfoundland (in what is today Canada). His father was George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore. George Calvert was chosen to be the proprietary governor of both Maryland and Newfoundland, but he died before he could take the position. He was called \"Cecil Calvert.\" Cecil was a Roman Catholic and the colony of Maryland was officially Catholic. He managed Maryland from his home in England. Maryland was known for its religious toleration. At the time, there was a lot of religious persecution in England. Many Catholics fled (ran away to) Maryland because their religion was accepted there. Calvert was governor of Maryland for forty-two years.American History Website Retrieved February 2011 He died in England on November 30, 1675, aged 70 years.
