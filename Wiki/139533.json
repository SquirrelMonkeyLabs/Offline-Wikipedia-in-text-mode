 "text": "Malemort-du-Comtat is a commune of 1,203 people (1999). It is in the region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in the Vaucluse department in the south of France. During the time of the Roman Empire, the village was called \"Calvia.\" The name Malemort means \"bad death\" and was probably used after the destruction of the village by the Franks. Comtat means \"county\", the land belonging to a count. Wine making has been carried out in region for at least 2,400 years. When wine making started again in medieval times, the Archbishop of Carpentras gave his monks a vineyard in Malemort du Comtat in 882. The village is in the mountains, surrounded by olive and cherry trees. The city was protected by high walls and eleven towers which were built in the 12th century. Three of the gateways in the wall are still standing. The church, Notre Dame de l’Assomption, was built in the 13th century. ==References== Category:Communes in Vaucluse",
