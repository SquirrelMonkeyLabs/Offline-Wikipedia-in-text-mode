 "text": "The coat of many colours is the usual English translation of the Hebrew term ketonet passim (כְּתֹנֶת פַּסִּים), an item of clothing given to Joseph, the son of Jacob in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Genesis, as a symbol of his love. The traditional reading of this story is that Joseph's brothers became jealous of this coat, among other things, and therefore sold Joseph into slavery. == Related pages == * Esau == Notes == == References == Category:Bible",
