 "text": "City status in the United Kingdom is granted by the British monarch to some communities. There are 70 cities in the United Kingdom (see list below) â€“ 56 in England, six in Wales, seven in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland. Becoming a city is not automatic. Many people think that any town that has a cathedral is a city. This is because Henry VIII built cathedrals in six English towns and made them cities by letters patent. A city council does not have any more powers than a borough or district council. Some city councils (like Ripon) are only parish councils, and have few little powers at all. == Official cities == Officially there are 70 cities in the United Kingdom (UK). Sunderland was made a city to mark Elizabeth II's Ruby anniversary (40 years as Queen). Eight others have been created in competitions to celebrate the new millennium and Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. ===Lord Mayors=== A city does not automatically have a Lord Mayor or Lord Provost in Scotland. There are 69 cities in the UK but only 30 Lord Mayors. * A Mayor is called \"The Worshipful the Mayor of A Town\". * A Lord Mayor is called \"The Right Worshipful The Lord Mayor of A City\". ** The Lord Mayors or Lords Provost of Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, City of London, and York are called \"The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor\" (or Provost). Of the 70 cities: (including 30 Lord Mayoralties or Lord Provostships) in the UK: * 52 are in England, 23 have a Lord Mayor * 6 are in Wales, 2 have a Lord Mayor * 7 are in Scotland, 4 have a Lord Provost * 5 are in Northern Ireland, 1 has a Lord Mayor. ==The former City of Rochester== Rochester was a city from 1211 to 1998. On April 1, 1974 the city council was abolished, and new letters patent were issued to the new Medway Borough Council to carry on the city name in the old city area.Letters Patent dated March 18, 1974, text retrieved from Medway Council archives website In 1979, Medway was renamed Rochester-upon-Medway and new letters patent made the whole of the new area a city.Letters Patent dated January 25, 1982, text retrieved from Medway Council archives website On April 1, 1998, Rochester-upon-Medway and Gillingham joined together to became the new unitary authority of Medway. Rochester upon Medway City Council did not appoint Charter Trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty so the city simply ceased to exist, because the council forgot. == List of officially-designated cities == City Mayor Year granted city status (Diocesan) Cathedral (pre 1888) Type of Local Government English Cities Bath 1590 Bath Abbey Charter Trustees Birmingham Lord Mayor 1889 not applicable metropolitan borough Bradford Lord Mayor 1897 Bradford Cathedral metropolitan borough Brighton & Hove 2000 not applicable unitary authority Bristol Lord Mayor 1542 Bristol Cathedral unitary authority Cambridge 1951 not applicable district Canterbury Lord Mayor TI Christchurch Cathedral district Carlisle TI Carlisle Cathedral district Chelmsford 2012 Chelmsford Cathedral Non- metropolitan district Chester Lord Mayor 1541 Chester Cathedral district Chichester TI Chichester Cathedral civil parish Colchester 2022 Not Applicable Borough Coventry Lord Mayor 1345 Coventry Cathedral metropolitan borough Derby 1977 not applicable unitary authority Durham TI Durham Cathedral district Ely TI Ely Cathedral civil parish Exeter Lord Mayor TI Exeter Cathedral district Gloucester 1541 Gloucester Cathedral district Hereford 1189 Hereford Cathedral civil parish Kingston upon Hull Lord Mayor 1897 not applicable unitary authority Lancaster 1937 not applicable district Leeds Lord Mayor 1893 not applicable metropolitan borough Leicester Lord Mayor 1919 not applicable unitary authority Lichfield 1553 Lichfield Cathedral civil parish Lincoln TI Lincoln Cathedral district Liverpool Lord Mayor 1880 Liverpool Cathedral (1880) metropolitan borough City of London Lord Mayor (The Rt Hon.)

Note that the City of London covers only the \"square mile\", and is usually just referred to as \"the City\". The larger conurbation of Greater London has no city charter, and consists of the City of London, the City of Westminster and 31 other London boroughs. This can be compared to the City of Brussels, within Brussels. City status was confirmed by Letters Patent dated July 9, 1974.London Gazette, issue no. 46352, September 24, 1974 The city status extends to the entire district, although the district council calls itself \"St Albans District Council\" or \"St Albans City and District\".

The counties replaced the previous district councils which had enjoyed city status. According to the Municipal Year Book, 1972 the royal burghs of Perth and Elgin officially enjoyed city status. The royal burghs of Brechin, Dunfermline and Kirkwall had also been officially described as \"cities\". As all burghs were abolished in 1975, these areas are now often called \"former cities\". Although Brechin does not have city status, the community council formed for the area uses the title \"City of Brechin and District\". The Provost of Inverness is the Area Convenor of the Inverness Area Committee of Highland Council. The Provost of Stirling is the civic head of the entire Stirling council area, although city status only extends to the town of Stirling. Armagh had previously enjoyed city status, with St Patrick's Cathedral the site of the metropolitan primate of all Ireland. The city status was lost in 1840 when the city corporation was abolished. However, the successor urban district council and district council frequently used the title of city without official sanction prior to 1994.

On the formation of a town council for Hereford in April 2000 the charter trustees were dissolved, and the city status temporarily lapsed. St. David's historically had city status because of the presence of St David's Cathedral. This status was lost in the 19th. century after local government reorganization. Letters Patent dated September 16, 1994 ordained that the \"Town of St. David's shall have the status of a City\".London Gazette, issue no. 53798, September 23, 1994 The title of City was used \"by courtesy\" after 1550 when Westminster ceased to be the see of a bishop.
