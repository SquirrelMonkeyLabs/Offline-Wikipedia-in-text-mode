 "text": "The Bradford Riots were a short period of hostile and violent rioting which began on 7 July 2001, in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It was a result of increased racism by far-right groups such as the British National Party and the National Front against the British Asian community. It was stoked by confrontation between the Anti-Nazi League and the far-right groups. Similar race riots had occurred earlier in other parts of Northern England, such as Oldham and Blackburn in May and Burnley in June.Bagguley, P. and Hussain, Y.
