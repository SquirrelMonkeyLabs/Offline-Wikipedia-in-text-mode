 "text": "The Angora goat () is a breed of domestic goat. It is named for Ankara, Turkey (before 1930, Angora). The Angora produces fine quality white or coloured mohair which is very similar to wool. Angoras were imported into Europe in 1554 by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1765 they were imported into Spain and about 1785 they were introduced into France. None of these were able to set up a successful mohair production. But in 1838 Angoras were successfully introduced in South Africa. Today, the Union of South Africa is one of the world's top mohair producers.Clifford C. Taylor, 'Significance of South African Agricultural Development', Journal of Farm Economics, Vol. 16, No. 2 (Apr., 1934), p. 258, JSTOR Angora goats are kept mostly for their output of mohair. == References == Category:Domesticated animals Category:Goat breeds",
