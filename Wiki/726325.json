 "text": "The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), is part of the United States National Institutes of Health. It has a database where scientists can put information for other people to read and use, especially information about molecules and the way they affect and create living things. According to its own website, NCBI's goal is to make it easier for people to invent new technology that can be used to study molecules and genes. It also sets up meetings for scientists to talk to each other, trains new scientists, develops computer-based ways of studying information, and conducts scientific research on its own. ==Beginning== In 1988, United States Senator Claude Pepper proposed the law that would create NCBI, and the rest of the United States Congress passed it. ==References== Category:1998 establishments in the United States Category:Research organizations in the United States Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services Category:United States government agencies Category:Health technology",
