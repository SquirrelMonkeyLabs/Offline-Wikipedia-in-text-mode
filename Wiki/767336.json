Through a variety of forms including painting, collage, drawing and installation, Aram has found the potential for image-making to function critically in its use as a tool for a certain renegotiation of history. He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. ==References== * Kamrooz Aram official website Category:American artists Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian painters Category:People from Shiraz",
