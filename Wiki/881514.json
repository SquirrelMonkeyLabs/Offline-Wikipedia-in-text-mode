 "text": "The government of Georgia has taken positive steps towards protecting religious minorities. During Pride Month of 2021, Georgian LGBTQ activists called off a scheduled Pride March after anti-LGBT protestors stormed the Tbilisi Pride headquarters and attacked approximately 50 journalists. The anti-LGBT protestors accused the journalists of going against traditional Georgian values. Tbilisi Pride accused the government and church of emboldening a \"huge wave of hate\" against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and failing to protect citizens' rights. Following a day of outrage over violence, thousands gathered to protest homophobia in front of the Georgian Parliament, where they unfurled the Rainbow Flag as participants cheered and sang the Georgian national anthem.Opposition, Activists, Tbilisi Pride Hold Silent Rally ‘for Freedom’, 7 July 2021Netgazeti, 7 July 2021 ==References== Georgia (country) Category:Politics of Georgia (country)",
