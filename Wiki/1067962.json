 "text": "Stuart's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus stuarti) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Corbett's Gap in the Knuckles Mountain Range, 1249 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 24.2 â€“ 25.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 33.45 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is light green in color with some darker green. The eardrum is green in color. The mouth is yellow in color. The legs and toes are yellow on top and darker yellow-gray below. The sides of the body are yellow in color. There are white bumps on the belly. Parts of the back legs are yellow in color. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities, to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
