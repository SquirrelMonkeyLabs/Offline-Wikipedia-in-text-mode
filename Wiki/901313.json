 "text": "Waging am See (officially: Waging a. See) is a municipality in Traunstein in Bavaria, Germany. The town, well-known as a climatic spa, is at the Waginger See, the warmest lake in Upper Bavaria, with temperatures up to 27 Â°C. ==Geography== Waging is west of the Waginger See. The name \"am See\" (\"on the lake\") is somewhat confusing: due to the lowering of the Tiroler Achen river, which comes from the southern end of the lake near the town of Petting, the water level declined about in 1867, which led to Waging being away from the waterside. ==References== Category:Traunstein (district)",
