 "text": "Mary Schilder (born 1 March 1950) is an Indonesian-born Dutch former judoka. Active during the 1970s, she won multiple international tournaments and became two times national champion. ==Judo career== Schilder was born on 1 March 1950 in Jakarta, Dutch East Indies. She had three brothers. When she was eight years old she moved to the Netherlands where she lived in Empe, near Zutphen. Her father was J. Dick Schilder, a judoka, judo teacher, director of \"Budo Bond Nederland\" and owner of a sport institute in Velp. Schilder started with judo in Jakarta at the age of three years being coached by her father. One of her first public appearances was in 1965 giving a demonstration during the opening of a new dojo. In the early 1970s she won several international tournaments. Her first victory was at the German Open in RÃ¼sselsheim in 1972. The following year she won the German Open in Munich and the British Open in London. In 1974 she finished second at the Dutch Open in Kerkrade. After finishing second at the 1972 national championships, she became national champion in 1973 and 1974. She took her mascot, a plush monkey, with her to all competitions. She worked as a teacher and a judo trainer. Next to judo she also did karate, jazz ballet and classical ballet. She worked at the sports school of her father in Velp, and from January 1973 she became a co-owner of it. In early 1976 she married to a businessman. He learned her that her salary was much too low. She quited at the sports school of her father and the couple started their own gym \"Jagyby\". Her father started using an image of her in leaflets of the sports school. Schilder didn't agree with that and this led to a lawsuit in December 1976. The leaflets were no longer allowed to be distributed, but because Schilder had given permission while she was still working there, she had to pay half of the printing costs and half of the the legal costs of the lawsuit. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch judoka Category:People from Jakarta Category:People from Gelderland",
