 "text": "WrestleMania XXX was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event made by WWE. It was held on April 6, 2014 at the Mercedes- Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was the thirtieth WrestleMania event held by the WWE and the first to also stream on the WWE Network. The main event saw Daniel Bryan defeat both Randy Orton and Batista in a triple threat match to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Bryan won the show's opening match against Triple H to get a spot in the main event. WrestleMania XXX also saw Brock Lesnar defeat The Undertaker and break his 23-year undefeated streak at WrestleMania. ==Background== At the Royal Rumble on January 26, 2014, Batista won the 30-man Royal Rumble match and secured his spot to headline WrestleMania XXX against whomever was the WWE World Heavyweight Champion after Elimination Chamber. Randy Orton kept his title in the match. At the same time, Daniel Bryan, who had a feud against Triple H since SummerSlam, was screwed from winning the championship multiple times by Triple H and his stable, the Authority. Bryan then wanted a match against Triple H at WrestleMania, and \"occupied\" WWE's flagship TV show Raw, leading to Triple H accepting the match. He then announced that the winner of that match would be added to the main event championship match, therefore making it a Triple Threat match. On February 21, it was announced by the WWE that Hulk Hogan was returning to the company and was going to host WrestleMania XXX. On February 24, Brock Lesnar returned along with Paul Heyman and appeared on Raw. They complained about not being in the title match at WrestleMania. To appease them, Triple H handed them a contract which gave Lesnar a match with anybody at WrestleMania as long as it wasn't Orton or Batista. Lesnar and Heyman didn't like this open challenge and tried to leave because they thought that nobody would be would not be a big enough challenge. Before they could leave, The Undertaker returned and stared Lesnar down. Undertaker looked at the WrestleMania sign and Lesnar signed the contract. Lesnar poked the pen against against Undertaker's chest for him to sign and Undertaker stabbed the pen through Lesnar's hand as well as chokeslamming Lesnar through the table afterwards. ==Matches== 1The other competitors in the match were: Aksana, Alicia Fox, Brie Bella, Cameron, Emma, Eva Marie, Layla, Naomi, Natalya, Nikki Bella, Rosa Mendes, Summer Rae and Tamina. === WWE Tag Team Championship Fatal 4-Way === Eliminated Team Wrestler Eliminated by Method Time 1 Los Matadores Diego Jack Swagger Submission 5:40 2 RybAxel Curtis Axel Cesaro Pinfall 11:43 3 The Real Americans Cesaro The Usos 16:13 Winners colspan=3 === Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle royal === Order Wrestler Eliminated by Time 1 Yoshi Tatsu Khali 00:17 2 Brad Maddox Rhodes & Khali 00:53 3 Brodus Clay Khali 01:26 4 The Great Khali Slater, McIntyre & Mahal 01:36 5 Zack Ryder McIntyre & Mahal 02:03 6 Darren Young Slater, McIntyre & Mahal 02:33 7 Drew McIntyre Henry 02:56 8 Jinder Mahal Henry 02:57 9 Heath Slater Henry 03:08 10 Mark Henry Big Show 03:14 11 Titus O'Neil Big Show 03:43 12 The Miz Marella 04:31 13 Santino Marella Del Rio 04:41 14 Xavier Woods Sandow 04:48 15 Damien Sandow Rhodes & Goldust 05:05 16 Justin Gabriel Big E 05:23 17 David Otunga Big E 05:35 18 Big E Fandango 05:55 19 Fandango Sheamus 06:43 20 R-Truth Big Show 07:01 21 Sin Cara Del Rio 07:19 22 Tyson Kidd Del Rio 07:35 23 Goldust Del Rio 08:05 24 Cody Rhodes Del Rio 08:23 25 Rey Mysterio Cesaro 09:05 26 Kofi Kingston Sheamus 11:12 27 Dolph Ziggler Del Rio 11:31 28 Alberto Del Rio Sheamus 12:17 29 Sheamus Del Rio 12:18 30 Big Show Cesaro 13:25 Winner Cesaro N/A == References == ==Other websites== * Category:2014 in professional wrestling Category:WrestleMania Category:2014 in American television Category:Sports in New Orleans Category:2010s in New Orleans",
