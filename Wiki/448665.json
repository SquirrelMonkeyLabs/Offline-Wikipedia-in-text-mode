 "text": "Penny Arcade is a webcomic about video games. It was created by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik. The comic debuted in 1998. Now, the comic has its own website which also hosts other comic strips. In addition, the site has information about Child's Play, a children's charity, and PAX, a gaming convention. Both are by Holkins and Krahulik. == The Comic Strip == The comic strip is about two characters who are based on the creators of the comic strip. John \"Gabe\" Gabriel is based Mike Krahulik, and Tycho Brahe is based on Jerry Holkins. Gabriel is happier, but can become very angry. Tycho Brahe (named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe) is unhappy and serious. The characters go through the same events their creators do, but react differently. Most of the comic strips involve the two characters commenting on nerd culture, usually video games. The strip has large amounts of cursing and has been known to offend people. == Other Media == Krahulik and Holkins have released podcasts called Downloadable Content since March 20, 2006. A series of four video games loosely based on the comic strip titled Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness began on May 21, 2008. Tycho appeared in the game Poker Night at the Inventory alongside characters from Team Fortress 2, Strong Bad and Sam & Max. Penny Arade: The Series is a reality televesion show about the strip and the Penny Arcade company that began on February 20, 2010. == References == == Other websites == * loonygames.com * penny-arcade.com Category:Webcomics Category:Video game websites Category:American entertainment websites",
