 "text": "The shore puha which is also known as the New Zealand sow thistle, is a plant in the family Asteraceae. It grows near the ocean in New Zealand. In Latin, the shore puha is called the Sonchus kirkii. == Appearance == The shore puha has green leaves that point up. It has a yellow flower. The shore puha usually grows up to 30 centimeters tall. It can sometimes grow up to 100 centimeters. == Conservation status == The conservation status of the shore puha is \"declining\" and it is also called \"at risk\". === Threats === Other species of weeds that grow more quickly might be the reason for the shore puha to be at \"declining\" because it is not as good at growing as the other plants. The plants Sonchus asper and Sonchus oleraceus can take over the habitats that the shore puha likes and grow in the area faster. Until the 1980s the shore puha was not in danger, but after that the amount of shore puhas left have been going down. == Other names == * pūhā * puha * puwha (in Māori) * raurōroa == Images == File:Sonchus_kirkii_in_Dunedin_Botanic_Garden_02.jpg|The shore puha in the Dunedin Botanic Garden.
