 "text": "The parliament of Poland has an upper house (the Senate) and a lower house (the Sejm). Both houses are accommodated in the Sejm complex in Warsaw. The parliament itself is without an official name; the Constitution refers only to the Sejm and the Senate. Members of both houses are elected by direct election, usually every four years. The Sejm has 460 members, while the Senate has 100 senators. To become law, a bill must first be approved by both houses. ==References== Category:National legislatures Category:Bicameral legislatures Category:Government of Poland",
