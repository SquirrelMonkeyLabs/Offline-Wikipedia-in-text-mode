Also, some foods (such as spinach) cooked on bare cast iron will turn black. Stainless steel is well known for its excellent durability and versatility in the kitchen. Crafted from a combination of metals, including iron, carbon, and chromium, stainless steel offers impressive resistance to rust, corrosion, and staining.
