 "text": "The WAGR B class were a total of 11 steam locomotives built in three batches in 1884 - 1886 and 1898, being operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) until 1959. The B class was a 4-6-0T type tank engine built by Kitson & Coy of Leeds, England and Dübs & Coy of Glasgow, Scotland originally for use on the Guildford to Chidlow section of the Eastern Railway which was rather steep. With the arrival of the K class onto the Eastern Railway in 1903, the B class were relegated to shunting duties until their withdrawal. The first batch was built in 1884 by Kitson comprising two locos, the second by Dübs in 1885/86 comprising three locos, and the last batch was built in 1898 by Kitson comprising six locos with enlarged water tanks for greater capacity. All B class locomotives were scrapped. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
