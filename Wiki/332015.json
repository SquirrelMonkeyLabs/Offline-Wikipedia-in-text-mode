 "text": "Pollyanna is a 1920 silent movie. It stars Mary Pickford. It was directed by Paul Powell. It was based on Eleanor H. Porter's novel Pollyanna. It was Pickford's first movie for United Artists. It became a great success. It would be regarded as one of the movies that defined Pickford's \"little girl\" movies. She was 27, but played a 12 year old girl. The movie made $1.1 million (that was about $10 million in 2008). This was a lot of money at the time.
