 "text": "The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season was the fourth consecutive season of above- average and damaging seasons dating back to 2016. This hurricane season has 20 tropical cyclones and 18 named storms in total in which tropical cyclones were formed in the Northern Hemisphere at the Atlantic basin. The season officially began on June 1, 2019, and ended on November 30, 2019. Subtropical Storm Andrea formed on May 20, making 2019 the fifth consecutive season in which storms formed before the official start of the hurricane season; this breaks the record of four consecutive years set in 1951-1954. Barry became the first hurricane of the season in early July. Hurricane Dorian became a first major hurricane of the season in late August, and later became a Category 5 hurricane on September 1, making 2019 the fourth consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane (Matthew in 2016; Irma and Maria in 2017; Michael in 2018). Tropical Storm Imelda formed on September 17 and caused catastrophic flooding over Southeast Texas, making Imelda one of the wettest tropical cyclones in U.S. history. Hurricane Lorenzo became a second Category 5 hurricane of the season on September 29, making 2019 one of the Atlantic hurricane seasons to feature more than one Category 5 hurricane; and also, this made Lorenzo the easternmost Category 5 hurricane on record, surpassing Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The season ended with Tropical Storm Sebastian on November 25. == Storms == ImageSize = width:800 height:220 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/2019 till:31/12/2019 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/2019 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_≤_39_mph_(≤62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–129_mph_(178–208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130–156_mph_(209–251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_≥_157_mph_(≥252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:20/05/2019 till:21/05/2019 color:TS text:\"Andrea (SS)\" from:11/07/2019 till:15/07/2019 color:C1 text:\"Barry (C1)\" from:22/07/2019 till:23/07/2019 color:TD text:\"Three (TD)\" from:21/08/2019 till:24/08/2019 color:TS text:\"Chantal (TS)\" from:24/08/2019 till:05/09/2019 color:C5 text:\"Dorian (C5)\" from:26/08/2019 till:29/08/2019 color:TS text:\"Erin (TS)\" from:03/09/2019 till:05/09/2019 color:TS text:\"Fernand (TS)\" from:03/09/2019 till:10/09/2019 color:TS text:\"Gabrielle (TS)\" from:13/09/2019 till:20/09/2019 color:C3 text:\"Humberto (C3)\" barset:break from:17/09/2019 till:25/09/2019 color:C2 text:\"Jerry (C2)\" from:17/09/2019 till:19/09/2019 color:TS text:\"Imelda (TS)\" from:22/09/2019 till:27/09/2019 color:TS text:\"Karen (TS)\" from:23/09/2019 till:02/10/2019 color:C5 text:\"Lorenzo (C5)\" from:11/10/2019 till:14/10/2019 color:TS text:\"Melissa (TS)\" from:14/10/2019 till:16/10/2019 color:TD text:\"Fifteen (TD)\" from:18/10/2019 till:19/10/2019 color:TS text:\"Nestor (TS)\" from:25/10/2019 till:26/10/2019 color:TS text:\"Olga (TS)\" from:25/10/2019 till:28/10/2019 color:C1 text:\"Pablo (C1)\" barset:break from:30/10/2019 till:01/11/2019 color:TS text:\"Rebekah (SS)\" from:19/11/2019 till:25/11/2019 color:TS text:\"Sebastien (TS)\" barset:break barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till barset:break bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/2019 till:31/05/2019 text:May from:01/06/2019 till:30/06/2019 text:June from:01/07/2019 till:31/07/2019 text:July from:01/08/2019 till:31/08/2019 text:August from:01/09/2019 till:30/09/2019 text:September from:01/10/2019 till:31/10/2019 text:October from:01/11/2019 till:30/11/2019 text:November from:01/12/2019 till:31/12/2019 text:December TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\"(From the\" pos:(618,30) text:\"Saffir–Simpson scale)\" For a record fifth consecutive year, activity began before the official start of the season when Subtropical Storm Andrea formed on May 20.
