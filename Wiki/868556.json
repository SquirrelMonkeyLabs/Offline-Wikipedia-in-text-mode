 "text": "The brown-belly leaf frog (Phyllomedusa tarsius) is a frog that lives in Guyana, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Brazil. People have seen this frog as high as 800 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is to long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 110 mm long. Their skin is green on the back and some of their toes are brown and white. They have white and orange bellies, white chests, and white throats. Their eyes are orange, red, and black mixed together. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lives in trees. Male frogs sit on tall plants near ponds and sing for females. The females lay 200-500 eggs at a time in nests. The nest is built out of leaves in trees hanging over the pond. The female puts jelly on the eggs so they don't dry out. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, even though human beings cut down its forests and allow cows to eat grass where the forest used to be. But the frog lives in such a large place and is so good at living in places that humans have changed that there are many alive now. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
