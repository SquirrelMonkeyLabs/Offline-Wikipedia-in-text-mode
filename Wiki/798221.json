He is a white supervillain who uses his superpowers, which give him control over electricity, to commit crimes and fight Spider-Man. He is a founding member of the supervillain group, the Sinister Six. The first and most well-known version of the character is Maxwell \"Max\" Dillon, a lineman for an electric company who turned to a life of crime after being struck by lightning while working on a power line and becoming a living electric capacitor. Since his conception, the character has undergone several design changes, from his original green and yellow costume, to his modern look with blue skin and a bald head. During the time that Max Dillon was dead between 2016 and 2021, a second Electro named Francine Frye was introduced. ==In other media == The character has been adapted to different forms of media, including toys, movies, television series, and video games.
