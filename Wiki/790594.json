 "text": "Hieracium is the hawkweed. This genus of sunflowers has a huge number of species over ten thousand species and subspecies. Some experts split it up into two genera: what is here treated as the single genus Hieracium is treated by some European experts as two genera, Hieracium and Pilosella. Like all members of the family, hawkweeds have tightly packed flowerheads made of many small flowers. They reproduce asexually by seeds which are genetically identical to those of the mother plant.Edsall, Marion 2007 [1985]. Roadside Plants and Flowers: a traveler's guide to the Midwest and Great Lakes area. University of Wisconsin Press, p46. ISBN 0-299-09704-8. Dewey 582.0977. A dry roadside dotted with small, 3/4 inch red orange flowers, interspersed with very similar yellow ones, and often the white of daisies, is a good sign that you are in Hawkweed country. == References == Category:Asteraceae",
