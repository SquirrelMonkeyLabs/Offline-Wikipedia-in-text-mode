 "text": "A vision quest is a spiritual experience in Native American religion and cultures. Typically young Native boys would do this quest. The quest included connecting with a guardian spirit. This spirit would provide wisdom, protection or advice. Young men went to remote locations and fasted. The locations were usually sacred places. Elders prepared the young person for the quest. Practices were different with different tribes. The young person would asks spirits to guide them. Spirits may tell them their role in the community or purpose in life. Visions could include symbols of animals. The vision quest was often a way of becoming an adult.McWhorter, Lucullus Virgil (1940). Yellow Wolf: His Own Story.
