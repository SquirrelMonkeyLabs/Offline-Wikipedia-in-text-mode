 "text": "Homestuck is a story on the internet made of pictures, words, and videos. Andrew Hussie released Homestuck from 2009 to 2016. The story is about four children who start playing a video game that causes the end of the world. Homestuck has over 8000 online pages and 800,000 words. It is a webcomic, but also uses animations, music, and video games. People in the comic often time travel to the past or the future. This creates many possible or imagined stories that all happen at the same time. At first, Hussie wanted his fans (people who are interested in something) to make the choices for the story. He later decided that this was too complicated, so he made more of the choices himself. Many fans wrote their ideas for Homestuck on blogs and internet forums. Hussie sometimes added these ideas to the story. Fans also made a lot of the artwork and music for the comic. In 2012, Hussie said that he was in control of the comic, but he was not in control of the \"movement\" of Homestuck. Homestuck was very popular, especially among teenagers. About a million people came to the website each day. Fans gave over 2 million dollars on Kickstarter to make a video game for the story. ==References== Category:Webcomics",
