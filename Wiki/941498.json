 "text": "On July 4, 2022, a mass shooting happened during an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, United States. The shooting happened at 10:14a.m. CDT (UTC−05:00) about 15 minutes after the parade had started. Seven people were fatally shot and at least 46 others were wounded by gunfire or injured in a stampede. The shooter was Robert Eugene Crimo III, who was caught eight hours after the shooting. Crimo began the shooting by firing a rifle from the rooftop of the Ross Cosmetics building. He got on the roof by using an unsecured ladder attached to the building. The shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P15; semiautomatic rifle with three 30-round magazines. After being caught, Crimo confessed that he thought about planning another shooting at another Independence Day parade in Madison, Wisconsin. Seven people were killed and 46 others were injured during the attack. Five of the victims—all adults—died at the scene and two died at the hospital. Many Chicago suburbs canceled their Fourth of July celebrations after the shooting. President Joe Biden stated that he was shocked by the shooting and also called for more gun control measures. ==References== Category:July 2022 events Category:2022 mass shootings in the United States Category:2022 in Illinois Category:Crime in Illinois",
