 "text": "thumb|A cobbler in Seattle, Washington. Shoemaking is the process of making footwear. Originally, shoes were made by handicraft. Few people buy shoes made by old-fashioned methods anymore, preferring cheaper ones made by industrial mass production. The old methods are still used for buyers who want unusually high quality. Shoemakers may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material. A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes very fine soft leather shoes. A cobbler is someone who repairs shoes. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Footwear Category:Industrial occupations",
