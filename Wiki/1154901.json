The fighting ended a few days after the official german surrender on 7/8 May. == History == On 2 May 1945, the Soviet captured Berlin after an 18 day fight for the city. At this point there is still fighting in Europe in both east and west, but on 7 May Germany signs its unconditional surrender. But the Soviets have a new offensive in plan. on the sixth the Prague offensive begins, the Soviets enter Breslau and Dresden. The Soviets were also joined with the Polish, Czechoslovak, and Romanian armies. The forces enter Czechia from the north-east border with Germany (who now has surrendered). The Soviets reach Prague on the ninth, just after noon the same day, forces from the south-east of the front link up with the forces that have already entered Prague. during the campaign, the Czech resistance started an uprising on the fifth with the the Russian liberation army (a collaborationist army that has been fighting with the Axis but now believe it is a hopeless cause) but soon the resistance betrays them and the leaders try to escape into American custody. But they fail and get executed by the Czech partisans and/or the Soviet Red Army. Meanwhile in Prague, the resistance succeeds fighting the Germans and before the Soviets arrive, the Germans surrender in Prague. == References == Category:20th-century conflicts Category:Wars involving Europe Category:Soviet Union Category:20th century in Europe",
