Among these, 533 patients have died, 8,663 have recovered, and 164 are in hospital, including 37 in intensive care. ==Lockdown effect== Denmark was among the first European countries to introduce lockdown measures, starting on 13 March. Following a period of increase in hospitalizations, the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 has been falling since late March, with the number of cases in need of intensive care and ventilator being well below available resources. Starting on 15 April, a very slow and gradual reopening has been initiated, but if there are indications that the number of infections increases too fast, it will be reversed. ==Greenland== The pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Greenland in March 2020. There have been 11 confirmed cases, but none in need of hospitalization.
