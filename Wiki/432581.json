But President Yanukovych wanted to maintain close relationships with Russia. This angered pro-EU civilians. They started Euromaidan. On 30 November, the police intervened, sometimes violently. As a result, more people came out to protest. Many people blocked the streets with their cars in a protest called Automaidan. The President fled in February 2014 but protests continued. In March 2014 the Russian Federation captured Crimea which angered many other nations. Some people feared this might lead to a global war. == Riots/revolution == As the riots continued, the protesters were attacked. Hundreds were killed or injured. Ukrainians got the freedom they wanted and a new government, although they have not yet entered into the European Union. Meanwhile, Ukraine lost Crimea to Russia. Russia did not like that the Ukrainian government was overthrown as the new more nationalist and anti-Russian government did not favor them. Some of the people in the east, in the Donbas, preferred the old President, and declared independence and wanted to join Russia. Many people in Ukraine, particularly in the east, suffered in fighting. == Related pages == * Orange Revolution * The Long Breakup, award-winning documentary about Ukraine after the end of the Soviet Union == References == == Other websites == *Euromaidan on Facebook Category:2013 crimes Category:2013 in Europe Category:2014 crimes Category:2014 in Europe Category:2010s in Ukraine Category:2010s protests Category:Riots in Europe Category:November 2013 events",
