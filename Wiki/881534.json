 "text": "Human rights in Kuwait are a topic of significant concern. Most notably, Kuwait's handling of the stateless Bedoon crisis has come under substantial criticism from international human rights groups and the United Nations. Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region. Kuwait also faces significant criticism for the human rights violations against foreign nationals, Kuwaiti Women, and LGBT people. == LGBT Rights == LGBT people living in Kuwait face discriminatory laws and public attitudes. The penal code contains some general provisions against debauchery and immorality that can be used to punish LGBT people. * Article 193 of the Penal Code punishes \"consensual intercourse between men of full age (from the age of 21)\" with a term of imprisonment of up to seven years. * Article 198 prohibits public immorality. In 2008, the law was expanded to also outlaw \"imitating the appearance of a member of the opposite sex\" with fines and or imprisonment. Foreign nationals infected with AIDS/HIV are deported. ==References== Kuwait Category:Kuwait Category:LGBT rights by country",
