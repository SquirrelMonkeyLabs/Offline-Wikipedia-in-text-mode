 "text": "Associated-Rediffusion later known as Rediffusion London, was the ITV franchise for London on weekdays between 22 September 1955 and 29 July 1968. It was the first ITV station to broadcast, and was a part of the \"Big Four\" companies that produced most of the ITV programs during this period. Rediffusion lost the London franchise in 1968 but merged with ABC to form Thames Television, which would serve London on weekdays from 1968 to 1992. == History == === Creation === Associated-Rediffusion Television was originally a partnership between British Electric Traction (BET), its subsidiary Broadcast Relay Services Ltd. (Traded as Rediffusion), and Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail, which was interested in commercial broadcasting as early as the 1920s. The aftermath of the financial losses made by the ITV system, Associated Newspapers sold the majority of its share in the company to BET and Rediffusion, the company did not drop the \"Associated\" part of Associated- Rediffusion until 1964. Associated Newspapers later realised the potential of ITV, they became a significant investor in the ITV franchisee for the south, Southern Television and later became a shareholder on Independent Television News (ITN). Boris Ford became Associated-Rediffusion's first head of schools broadcasting in 1957. During his role as head of schools broadcasting he persuaded Benjamin Britten to compose his church opera Noye's Fludde for a series of programmes. However, Ford was dismissed before the opera was produced, allegedly for shortcomings and inexperience in his administrative role. === Rebranding and end of franchise === In 1964, the company simplified its official name to \"Rediffusion Television\". Because of the new name they also rebranded the station as \"Rediffusion London\". In October 1967 the Independent Television Authority announced that the company would no longer serve the region after the contract expires in 1968. Due to changes in the ITV network, the weekend franchises in the Midlands and North of England being abolished. ABC Weekend TV, the holders of the now abolished weekend franchises tried applying for the London weekend franchise but the licence was awarded to the London Television Consortium. To preserve ABC, the ITA proposed ABC and Rediffusion make a new company: Thames Television. This was not a merger as commonly stated. ABPC, ABC's parent company and BET, Rediffusion's parent company, created Thames as a separate company. Thames would use staff from ABC's Teddington Studios and Rediffusion's Television House. BET took a 49% stake in Thames and was under-represented in the management. Rediffusion objected towards this and was given two options. Either Thames tok the contract or ABC took over. Rediffusion chose Thames Television and went of air on 29 July 1968 at 12:26 am. Rediffusion's employees at Wembley would work for London Weekend Television while the employees at Television House would work for Thames. Some staff re-located to Yorkshire Television in Leeds. == Identity == When Rediffusion launched in September 1955 they adopted a simple look, only having: the station name, and a spinning star called the Adastral. The ident was accompanied by a five note electronic tune, made by tapping out the morse code for 'A-R'. In 1964, Rediffusion changed its name from Associated Rediffusion to Rediffusion London, the look was changed to follow. The ident included: a black and grey background, the spinning Adastral star and a sliding animation. The five note tune was replaced by a seven note theme. == References == Category:ITV (TV network)",
