 "text": "Eleanor \"Nell\" Gwyn (or Gwynn or Gwynne) (1650 - 14 November 1687), was one of the earliest English actresses to receive prominent recognition, and a long- time mistress of King Charles II. Called \"pretty, witty Nell\" by Samuel Pepys, she has been called a living embodiment of the spirit of Restoration England and has come to be considered a folk heroine, with a story echoing the rags- to-royalty tale of Cinderella.
