 "text": "Gérard Lamy (2 May 1919 - 26 October 2016) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada from 1962 to 1963. During this time, he represented the electoral area of Saint-Maurice—Laflèche and was a part of the Social Credit Party. Lamy was born on 2 May 1919 in Shawinigan, Quebec. Before becoming a politician, he was a contractor. Lamy was only elected one time, in the 1962 federal election. He beat the incumbent Liberal MP, Joseph-Adolphe Richard. Lamy was part of the first group of 26 Social Credit MPs from Quebec who were elected that year. In the election the year after, he lost his election. This was very unexpected, because both Lamy and the Liberal Party thought he would not lose the election. The person that beat him was Liberal Jean Chrétien. Chrétien would later become the Prime Minister of Canada. Lamy tried to win two more elections after this. In the 1970 Quebec provincial election, he lost his election as a part of the Ralliement créditiste du Québec. In the 1979 general election, he lost his election as a part of the Progressive Conservative Party. Lamy did not run for election ever again after 1979. He died in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, on 26 October 2016. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1919 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Quebec",
