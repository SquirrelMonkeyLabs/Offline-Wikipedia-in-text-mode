 "text": "The Puerta del Sol (Sun Gate) is known as 'Spain's belly button'. In the 1400s, it was the gate or entrance of the east side of the city. Since the sun rises in the east, it got the name Puerta del Sol. It is now the center of 'kilometer 0' of Madrid. All roads are measured from this point. It was rebuilt in 1854. The statue of King Carlos III is in the middle of the square. The red brick building there is the former post office. The famous Oso y el Madro単o (bear eating madro単os) statue can also be found here. The Puerta del Sol is also famous for its New Year's celebration which has been broadcast on television since December 31, 1962. ==Gallery== File:El oso y el madro単o de la Puerta del Sol, Madrid.jpg|Statue of El oso y el madro単o File:MadridPuertaDelSol Km0.jpg|The kilometer zero on the pavement in front of the House of the Post Office File:Black and white photograph taken at Puerta del Sol in Madrid.jpeg|Post Office - Puerta del Sol, Madrid.
