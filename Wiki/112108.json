 "text": "The New York Americans were a professional ice hockey team, the third expansion team in the history of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the second to play in the United States. The team was part of the NHL from the 1925-26 season until the end of the 1941-42 season. The team was very popular in its first season. This popularity led to a new team, the New York Rangers, being organized for the 1926-26 season. The increasing success of the New York Rangers in the 1930s resulted in a decrease in popularity for the New York Americans. In 1941 the team name was changed to Brooklyn Americans, the name for a borough of New York City. After the 1941-42 season the team decided to stop competing until the end of World War II. When the war ended the NHL decided to not have the team play again. The New York Americans played their home games at Madison Square Garden in New York City. == Season-by-season record == Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes Season GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Finish Playoffs 1925-26 36 12 20 4 28 68 89 361 5th, NHL Out of Playoffs 1926-27 44 17 25 2 36 82 91 349 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1927-28 44 11 27 6 28 63 128 563 5th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1928-29 44 19 13 12 50 53 53 486 2nd, Canadian Lost Quarterfinals (NY Rangers) 1929-30 44 14 25 5 33 113 161 372 5th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1930-31 44 18 16 10 46 76 74 495 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1931-32 48 16 24 8 40 95 142 596 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1932-33 48 15 22 11 41 91 118 460 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1933-34 48 15 23 10 40 104 132 365 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1934-35 48 12 27 9 33 100 142 250 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1935-36 48 16 25 7 39 109 122 392 3rd, Canadian Won Quarterfinals (Chicago) Lost Semifinals (Toronto) 1936-37 48 15 29 4 34 122 161 481 4th, Canadian Out of Playoffs 1937-38 48 19 18 11 49 110 111 327 2nd, Canadian Won Quarterfinals (NY Rangers) Lost Semifinals (Chicago) 1938-39 48 17 21 10 44 119 157 276 4th, NHL Lost Quarterfinals (Toronto) 1939-40 48 15 29 4 34 106 140 236 6th, NHL Lost Quarterfinals (Detroit) 1940-41 48 8 29 11 27 99 186 231 7th, NHL Out of Playoffs 1941-42 48 16 29 3 35 133 175 425 7th, NHL Out of Playoffs Totals 784 255 402 127 637 1643 2182 6665 ==Notable players== ===Hall of Famers=== *Billy Burch *Charlie Conacher *Lionel Conacher *Red Dutton *Chuck Rayner *Sweeney Schriner *Joe Simpson *Hooley Smith *Nels Stewart *Roy Worters *Busher Jackson ===Team captains=== *Billy Burch (1925-32) *Red Dutton (1932-36) *Sweeney Schriner (1936-39) *Charlie Conacher (1939-41) *Tommy Anderson (1941-42) == Coaches == Head Coaches for the New York Americans: * Tommy Gorman, 1925-26 * Newsy Lalonde, 1926-27 * Shorty Green, 1927-28 * Tommy Gorman, 1928-29 * Lionel Conacher, 1929-30 * Eddie Gerard, 1930-31,1931-32 * Bullet Joe Simpson, 1932-33 to 1934-35 * Red Dutton, 1935-36 to 1941-42 ==References== *New York Americans * Category:Defunct National Hockey League teams Category:Sports in New York City",
