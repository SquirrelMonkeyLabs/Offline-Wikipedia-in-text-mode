 "text": "Gay pride, or LGBT pride, is a positive stand against hatred, discrimination or violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Gay pride builds trust and rights. It promotes the LGBT as a group. It also honors sexual orientation of all kinds and differences in gender. It is also a remembrance for those who lost their lives due to gay bashing, or those who were punished by the law because homosexuality was illegal. It also shows respect to those who still can't live their lives freely in countries where it is still illegal or very discriminated against. Pride Month is celebrated every June. Usually, events are organised. Some of these include processions, but they may also be protests against rules that are seen as too harsh. Category:LGBT rights",
