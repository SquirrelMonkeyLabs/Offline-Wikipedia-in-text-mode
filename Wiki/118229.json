 "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks are an American professional basketball team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They play in the National Basketball Association. The current franchise owner is a group led by hedge fund managers Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry. They play their home games at the Fiserv Forum, which replaces their home of the last 30 seasons, BMO Harris Bradley Center, for 2018–19 and beyond. They won two NBA championships in 1971 and 2021. In their 2019–20 season, the Bucks clinched a playoff berth after the team's 56th regular- season game, becoming the fastest team to clinch a playoff spot measured by the number of games played and by the calendar date (February 23) since the NBA changed its playoff format in 1984. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Milwaukee Bucks Statistics * Milwaukee Bucks History Category:National Basketball Association teams Category:Sports in Milwaukee Category:1968 establishments in the United States Category:1960s establishments in Wisconsin",
