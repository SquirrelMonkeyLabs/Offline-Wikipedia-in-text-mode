 "text": "The Immortal Game was a chess game played on 21 June 1851 by Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky. Anderssen was White, and he played the King's Gambit opening. The number of pieces Anderssen sacrificed (gave up) in order to win has made it one of the most famous chess games of all time. Anderssen gave up both his rooks, a bishop, then his queen, checkmating his opponent with the remaining bishop and two knights. Category:Chess",
