 "text": "In the human hand, palmar or volar plates (or ligaments) are in between the hand bones called metacarpals in the palm, and the finger bones called phalanges. These plates or ligaments help protect and control the finger bones, make sure they move the right way, and make sure the finger joints can't be pulled apart. == Structure == This joint padding starts at the bottom joint of the first finger bone (proximal phalange), and then goes on to the next joint connecting to the middle finger bone (intermediate phalange). == Additional images == Category:Limbs and extremities",
