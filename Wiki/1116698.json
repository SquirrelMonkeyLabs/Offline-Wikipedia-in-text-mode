Passengers have to pay a fare to the driver. ==By country== ===United Kingdom=== In the United Kingdom postbus services by Royal Mail started in 1967 to replace declining local bus and rail services in rural areas. In 2006 there were more than 200 services operated by Royal Mail. They often ran only once or twice a day. In April 2009, the Royal Mail ended its postbus services in much of the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. Five routes were cancelled. The services were replaced by a bus service operated by the Stagecoach Group. In August 2017, Royal Mail ran its last Tongue to Lairg postbus in the United Kingdom. ==References== ==Other websites== *Royal Mail Postbus website *Royal Mail Postbus Routefinder Category:Royal Mail Category:Bus transport in the United Kingdom Category:Postal services in the United Kingdom",
