 "text": ":Goth can also stand for a member of the Goth subculture The Goths (Gothic: , ) were an East Germanic tribe that spoke the Gothic language. Jordanes, a scholar from the 6th century, wrote a summary of a 12-volume work by Cassiodorus about the Goths that is commonly called Getica. Since the original work by Cassiodorius was lost, Getica is the only surviving contemporary account about the Goths. It states that the Goths left Scandinavia via Gotland and settled close to the mouth of the Vistula River, in present-day Poland. In the 3rd and the 4th centuries they settled Scythia, Dacia and parts of Moesia and Asia Minor, fought with the Roman Empire and later adopted Arianism (a form of Christianity). In the 4th and the 5th centuries, they split into the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths. With that move, they established powerful successor-states to the Roman Empire in Italy and on the Iberian Peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). Traces of Gothic blood can be found in many people .Jordanes, Getica. == References == Category:Germanic tribes Category:Ancient Rome",
