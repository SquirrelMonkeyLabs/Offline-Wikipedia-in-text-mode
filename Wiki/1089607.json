Founded in 1364 by King Casimir III the Great, it is the oldest university in Poland and the 13th oldest university in continuous operation in the world. It is regarded as Poland's most famous academic institution. The university is important for Polish culture as well as a significant contributor to the intellectual heritage of Europe. The campus is in the middle of Kraków. The university consists of thirteen main faculties, and three faculties composing the Collegium Medicum. It employs roughly 4,000 academics and provides education to more than 35,000 students who study in 166 subjects. The main language of instruction is Polish, although around 30 degrees are offered in English and some in German. The university library is among the largest of its kind and has a number of medieval manuscripts, including the landmark De Revolutionibus by alumnus Nicolaus Copernicus. In addition to Copernicus, the university's notable alumni include heads of state King John III Sobieski, Pope John Paul II, and Andrzej Duda; Polish prime ministers Beata Szydło and Józef Cyrankiewicz; renowned cultural figures Jan Kochanowski, Stanisław Lem, and Krzysztof Penderecki; and leading intellectuals and researchers such as Hugo Kołłątaj, Bronisław Malinowski, Carl Menger, Leo Sternbach, and Norman Davies. Four Nobel laureates have been at the university, all in literature: Ivo Andrić and Wisława Szymborska, who studied there, and Czesław Miłosz and Olga Tokarczuk, who taught there. Faculty and graduates of the university have been elected to the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Society, the British Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and other honorary societies. ==References== Category:Colleges and universities in Poland Category:Buildings and structures in Kraków Category:1360s establishments",
