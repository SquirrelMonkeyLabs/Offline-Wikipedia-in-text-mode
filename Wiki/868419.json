 "text": "Coastal California, also known as the California coastline, Golden Coast refers to parts of California near the ocean. ==Geography== Coastal California includes the North Coast, San Francisco Bay Area (including Silicon Valley), Central Coast, and South Coast. The coastline is slowly eroding because of natural processes and it may be happening faster because of climate change. In the last 100 years, the water level has gone to less than 6 in (150 mm) along the coast of California. In the next 100 years, the water is expected to go from less than 6 in (150 mm) to 9 ft (2.7 m), which is a danger to the many houses at the coast. ===Counties=== The counties that are part of coastal California are: ;South Coast *Los Angeles *Orange *San Diego ;Central Coast *Monterey *San Benito *San Luis Obispo *Santa Barbara *Santa Cruz *Ventura ;San Francisco Bay Area *Alameda *Contra Costa *Marin *Napa *San Francisco *San Mateo *Santa Clara *Solano *Sonoma ;North Coast *Del Norte *Humboldt *Mendocino ==References== Category:Geography of California",
