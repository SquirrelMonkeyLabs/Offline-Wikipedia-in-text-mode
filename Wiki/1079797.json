 "text": "Peder Als (16 May 1725 – 8 July 1775) was a Danish painter. He painted historical paintings and paintings of people. ==Life== Als was born in the city of Copenhagen in 1725, and studied from Carl Gustaf Pilo. In 1743, he sold a painting to the King of Denmark, which made him famous. He attended the Kunstakademiet (the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts). He painted knights of the order of the Dannebrog there. He won the academy's gold medal in 1755. He went to Rome and Paris in 1757–62. In Rome, he studied from Anton Raphael Mengs. He spent most of his time in Rome copying the pictures of Raphael and Andrea del Sarto, and he did that correctly. He also copied Correggio and Titian. When he went back to Denmark, he painted some good portraits, but a lot of people said that his colouring was too dark to give a good effect to his pictures of women. He became a member of the Kunstakademiet in 1764. He became a professor at the Kunstakademiet in 1766. He died in 1775. He did paintings in oil, he also worked in pastel and produced miniatures. ==Gallery== File:Sophie magdalenequeenofdenmark.jpg|Sophia Magdalena of Denmark File:Peder Als Johannes Wiedewelt 1766.jpg|Johannes Wiedewelt, 1766 File:Frederik Christian Kaas.jpg|Frederik Christian Kaas (1727–1804) File:Peter Christian Winsløw.jpg|Peter Christian Winsløw ==References== ==Sources== * Bryan, Michael (1886). \"Als, Peter\".
