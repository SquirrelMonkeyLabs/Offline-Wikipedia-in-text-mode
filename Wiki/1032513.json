This frog looks like other frogs in Rhacophorus but it has black spots on the undersides of the webbed skin of its feet. It has no vomerine teeth in its jaws. It has a white mark on its belly in the shape of a kite. It back is red-brown with brown marks and black spots. It has white spots on its head and back. In Sumatra, human beings cut down forests for mining and to grow palm trees for oil. Scientists think that could be a danger to this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
