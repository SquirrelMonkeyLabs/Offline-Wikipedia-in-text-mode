The word was coined in the early 1980s, originally in the United States, to denote a young white-collar professional working in a city. Yuppies are generally professionals between 20 to 40 years old, usually from an intermediate living standard between the middle and upper class. The word first appeared in a May 1980 Chicago magazine article by Dan Rottenberg. ==References== Category:Slang",
