 "text": "In financial markets, stock is the partial ownership of a company. Shareholders bear the financial (but not legal) risk of the corporation, and receive dividends, which are a piece of the net income. A person or organization which holds shares of stocks is called a shareholder. The value of the stock multiplied by the number of shares owned by _all_ shareholders is the market capitalization. This is the most common metric for valuing a publicly traded company. Stocks can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges. Someone who buys and sells stock on the behalf of another individual is called a stockbroker. In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term share is used the same way as stock is described in the United States. ==Related pages== * corporation * Joint-stock company ==References== == Other websites == * The Oldest Share in the world, issued by the Dutch East India Company VOC, 1606. *Stock Market Trivia: History of Stocks *Who Decides Stock Prices? *Researching Old Company Stock Certificates Category:Finance",
