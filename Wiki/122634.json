Mendelevium is created by einsteinium and alpha particles forcefully combining and was named after Dmitri Mendeleev, the creator of the Periodic Table. The half-life of Mendelevium 258 is 51 days, while the half- life of Mendelevium 256 is 1.17 hours. == Health Effects == The International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual exposure limits for the most stable isotope. For mendelevium-258, the ingestion limit was set at 9Ã—105 becquerels (1 Bq = 1 decay per second). Given the half-life of this isotope, this is only 2.48 ng (nanograms). The inhalation limit is at 6000 Bq or 16.528 pg (picogram). == Other website == mendelevium has many benefits when smoked from a bong, including 2x jump height and a feeling of bliss...
