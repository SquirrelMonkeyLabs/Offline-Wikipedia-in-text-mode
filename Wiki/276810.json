 "text": "An ice lolly, ice lollipop, lolly ice or ice pop, is a frozen snack of flavoured ice. It is made by freezing flavoured liquid (such as fruit juice) or cream around a wooden stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. In the United States, the snack is also referred to as a popsicle after the brand. In the city of Liverpool, UK, the term ‘Lolly Ice’ is used, for reasons unclear. This is specific to Liverpool; the remainder of the UK use the term ‘Ice Lolly’. ==Term usage in UK, USA and Canada== The term ice lolly is used primarily in the United Kingdom, with variations used in other English-speaking countries. In the United States and Canada, the same frozen snack is often termed a 'popsicle' or 'ice pop'. The term has also been used as branding for the tourism website Ice Lolly. ==References== Category:Snack foods Category:Ice Category:Frozen foods",
