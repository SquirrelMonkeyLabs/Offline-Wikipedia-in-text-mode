 "text": "Meconium is a dark-green substance that comes from a newborn infant. The mass comes as the first poo the infant does. the mass is made during development. Faeces are the water insoluble and solid waste products that collect in the gestational intestine. Later bowel movements are not the same and will start being normal. While gestation is ongoing, waste is created by the fetus, such as carbon dioxide from oxygen as gaseous waste. The fetus urinates into the placenta to store liquid waste. The dark-green mass also contains dead skin cells, hair or multiple hairs, as well as poo. Category:Humans",
