 "text": "Bright Eyes is an American indie rock band. The people in the band are Conor Oberst, a singer-songwriter; Mike Mogis, a musician and producer; and other friends and session musicians from Omaha, Nebraska, USA. Many people think the band's songs are about Oberst, but Oberst has said that they are not. For example, one song, \"Padraic My Prince\", tells the fictional story of a mother drowning her son in a bathtub. In interviews, Oberst has said that he sings about such things to make rich emotions. ==Music== ===Albums=== *Letting Off the Happiness (1998) *Fevers and Mirrors (2000) *A Collection of Songs: Recorded 1995-1997 (2000) *Lifted or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground (2002) *Vinyl Box Set (7 LP's) (2003) This collection contains Oberst's first five releases plus bonus material. *I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning (2005) *Digital Ash in a Digital Urn (2005) *Cassadaga (2007) *The People's Key (2011) *Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was (2020) ===EPs/Singles=== The band has made many extended plays (EPs) and singles. *Every Day and Every Night EP (1999) *\"Don't Be Frightened Of Turning The Page\" (2001) *\"Oh Holy Fools: The Music of Son, Ambulance & Bright Eyes\" (2001) *\"Drunk Kid Catholic\" CDS (2001) *There Is No Beginning To The Story EP (2002) *Lover I Don't Have To Love CDS (2002) *Home: IV EP (2004) *One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels EP (2004) *\"Lua\" (2004) *Take It Easy (Love Nothing) (2004) *Four Winds EP (2007) == References == Category:American rock bands Category:Indie bands Category:Electronic music groups Category:Musical groups from Nebraska Category:Musicians from Omaha, Nebraska Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Nebraska",
