Before being promoted to the Premier League for the 2011â€“12 season, they had played in the English Football League since 1920. They were founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and played at the Vetch Field ground until 2005 when they moved to the Liberty Stadium. Their most successful period as a team was in the early 1980s under their manager John Toshack when they played in the old First Division from 1981-1983 (which was the highest tier of English football at the time). Swansea play their home games in an all white strip. Their main rivals are Cardiff City and a match between the two sides is known as the South Wales derby. As well as competing in the English League they have also won the Welsh Cup ten times and the Football Association of Wales Premier Cup twice. In 2011, they were promoted to the Premier League after winning the Football League Championship play-offs after finishing third in the league. They avoided relegation in their first Premier League season ending up in 11th place. ==Name== *1912-1970 Swansea Town F.C. *1970-present Swansea City A.F.C. ==League position== Season League Position 2000/01 Second Division 23rd 2001/02 Third Division 20th 2002/03 Third Division 21st 2003/04 Third Division 10th 2004/05 League Two 3rd 2005/06 League One 6th 2006/07 League One 7th 2007/08 League One Champions 2008/09 League Championship 8th 2010/11 League Championship 3rd 2011/12 Premier League 11th 2012/13 Premier League 9th 2013/14 Premier League 12th 2014/15 Premier League 8th 2015/16 Premier League 12th 2016/17 Premier League 15th 2017/18 Premier League 18th 2018/19 EFL Championship 10th 2019/20 EFL Championship 6th 2020/21 EFL Championship 4h ===Former position=== ==References== *http://www.swanseacity.net/page/Welcome - Club home page Category:Premier League clubs Category:Swansea Category:1912 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:20th-century establishments in Wales",
