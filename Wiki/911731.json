 "text": "Roman art was created in Ancient Rome. It includes architecture, painting, sculptures and mosaic work. It was most prolific from about the first to the fourth century AD. Ancient Roman pottery was not considered to be artwork; it was for everyday use. Almost no painting survives today, and the paintings that are known are probably not the best the Romans could produce. Category:Art art",
