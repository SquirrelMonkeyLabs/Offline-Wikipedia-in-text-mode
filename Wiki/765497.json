 "text": "The green-thighed frog (Nyctimystes brevipalmatus) is a frog from Australia. It lives near the east coast of Australia near Brisbane. The green-thighed frog is mostly brown with black stripes from its mouth to its front legs. Its thighs are light blue or green with black spots. They live near temporary bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. According to the IUCN Red List, green-thighed frogs are endangered because people cut down the forests and build roads and railroads in the places where they like to live, because of fires and pollution, and because of invasive species. Green-thighed frogs lay eggs that float together on top of the water. The tadpoles hatch within one day, stay tadpoles for 40 days and most become frogs before they are 100 days old. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
