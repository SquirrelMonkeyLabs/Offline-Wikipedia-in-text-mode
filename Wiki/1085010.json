The group also worked with anti-Kurdish groups in the Battle of Ras al-Ayn which spanned from 2012-2013. However the group was forcibly removed from power in Yaroubiya in October of 2013, after the Al-Nusra Front took power and claimed to be corrupt by Daesh and Al-Nusra. == References == Category:Rebel militia groups in Asia Category:Pages with unreviewed translations",
