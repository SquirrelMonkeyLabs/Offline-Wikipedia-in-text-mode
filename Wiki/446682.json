 "text": "Ground tissue is the name for a number of different kinds of tissue of plants. These kinds are usually classified by looking at the cell walls. There are three different main kinds: *Parenchyma cells have thin primary walls and usually remain alive after they become mature. Parenchyma forms the \"filler\" tissue in the soft parts of plants. *Collenchyma cells have thin primary walls with some areas of secondary thickening. Collenchyma provides extra structural support, particularly in regions of new growth. *Sclerenchyma cells have thick lignified secondary walls and often die when mature. Sclerenchyma provides the main structural support to a plant.
