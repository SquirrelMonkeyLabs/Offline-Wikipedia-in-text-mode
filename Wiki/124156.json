 "text": "Two and a Half Men is an American sitcom which was first shown on CBS on September 22, 2003 and ended on February 19, 2015. The series centers around a man named Charlie, whose lifestyle is interrupted when his brother Alan (who had just been divorced from his wife) moves in to his Malibu, California house, along with Alan's son Jake. The show has temporarily stopped because it was announced that Charlie Sheen was entering rehab. On March 7, 2011, the network fired Charlie Sheen from Two and a Half Men. The network did not state if the show would go on or not. The show is rated M in New Zealand for drug references and sexual references. == Characters == * Charlie Sheen as Charles Francis \"Charlie\" Harper, a ladies man, never married, jingle/children's song writer who picks on his younger brother Alan but really loves him. He likes his nephew Jake and gives him advice. * Jon Cryer as Alan Jerome Harper, Charlie's twice-divorced brother, who always has bad luck and is constantly teased by Charlie. After losing his house to Judith after the divorce, he is staying with Charlie. He is a generally nice and polite person but seems to have a weakness for women who treat him badly that comes from the loveless relationship he had with his and Charlie's mom. * Angus T. Jones as Jacob David \"Jake\" Harper, Alan's lazy and stupid son. He spends most of his free time playing video games, eating and watching television. He loves his father and uncle but is often rude to them. * Marin Hinkle as Judith Harper, Alan's first ex-wife. She hates Alan and takes every chance she gets to make him look stupid. She was the first woman Alan ever slept with, but their marriage was cold and Alan said that the only time she was ever happy being sexual was when she was pregnant with Jake. * Holland Taylor as Evelyn Harper, Charlie and Alan's selfish mother, and Jake's grandmother. * Melanie Lynskey (Starring Seasons 1-2; Recurring Season 3-), as their neighbor Rose, a sometime stalker of Charlie. She often enters and exits Charlie's house by climbing onto the patio. She has stated that she has a Masters Degree in psychology. * Kandi, Alan's young, second ex-wife. After an unplanned wedding in Las Vegas, Kandi divorced him and got their condo, but they continued to have regular booty calls. == Awards and nominations == The show has received lots of nominations, including 23 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and 2 Golden Globe nominations.
