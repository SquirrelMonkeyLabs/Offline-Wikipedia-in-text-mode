 "text": "Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka are Tamil people from India living in Sri Lanka. They are also known as Malayaga Tamilar, Hill Country Tamils, Up-Country Tamils or Indian Tamils. They come from the workers sent from Southern India to Sri Lanka in the 19th and 20th centuries to work in coffee, tea and rubber plantations by British people. Some also came to Sri Lanka on their own as business people. These Tamil people mostly live in the middle part of Sri Lanka, also known as the Malayakam or Hill Country and in the Northern Province. Most Indian Tamil people who are living in Hill Country are children from the lower working castes of South India. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Sri Lanka",
