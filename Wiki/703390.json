 "text": "Frederick is a city in Rice County, Kansas, United States. In 2010, 18 people lived there. In 2020, only 8 people lived there. ==History== Frederick became a city in 1909. It was a shipping point at the junction of the Missouri Patfic and the St. Louis & San Francisco railroads. A post office was opened in Frederick (also spelled historically Frederic) in 1887. It stayed until 1954. In July 2015, government officials said they were considering un-incorporating the city. As of August 2015, for the first time in nearly 130 years, the city doesn't have a city council. There was also no one who ran for mayor in April 2015. The future of Frederick is unknown because Rice County isn't able to un- incorporate the city. State law says that residents must bring a petition to the city council. Then a special election will be called for a vote. Since there isn't a city council, it can't happen.Frederick is on the brink of vanishing, with county left in lurch over town showing no participation; Kansas Agland; August 27, 2015.The uncertain future of Frederick; TheHutchinsonNews; YouTube.Frederick, population nine, lingers as Rice County ponders town's future; Kansas Agland; July 12, 2015. In November 2016, the community voted on whether to un-incorporate Frederick. Election workers at the Eureka Township voting location made a mistake. They accidentally gave the wrong ballots to township residents who didn't actually live in Frederick. 20 people voted. 13 voted to keep the city, but only 9 people live in Frederick. The mistake was noticed more than a week after the vote was certified. There is only a 5 day window to contest a vote. Because of this, Kansas Law kept the results.
