Meru, is sacred. Hindus believe Kailash is the home of Lord Shiva and his wife Parvati and sons Ganesh and Kartikeya. Hindus believe that it is impossible to climb to Kailash, but every year pilgrims come to Tibet to walk around it. The Tibetan people believe that people should not climb Mount Kailash. It is believed to have never been climbed. == References == Category:Mountains of Tibet Category:Hinduism Category:Buddhism",
