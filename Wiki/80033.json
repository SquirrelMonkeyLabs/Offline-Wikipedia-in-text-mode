 "text": "Léogâne is the name of both a coastal city and a district in Ouest Department, Haiti. The city of Léogâne is around . The arrondissement of Léogâne contains three communes: Petit-Goâve, Grand-Goâve, and the city of Léogâne. The town was at the epicenter of the 12 January 2010 earthquake and was catastrophically affected, with 80–90% of buildings damaged. This is because the country could not afford earthquake-proof buildings as it is very poor. The port town is about West of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Léogâne is the birthplace of the Taíno queen Anacaona (the town was originally called the Amerindian name Yaguana and the city's name is a corruption of that) and of Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité, the wife of the Haitian revolutionary Jean- Jacques Dessalines (1758). ==References== Category:Cities in Haiti",
