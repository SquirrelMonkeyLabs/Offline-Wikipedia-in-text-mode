 "text": "The Hala'ib Triangle (مثلث حلايب in Arabic, transliterated Muthāllath Ḥalāʾib) is an area of land measuring located on the Red Sea's African coast. The area, which is named after the town of Hala'ib, is created by the difference in the Egypt-Sudan border between the \"political boundary\" set in 1899 by the Anglo- Egyptian Condominium, which runs along the 22nd parallel north, and the \"administrative boundary\" set by the British in 1902, which gave an area of land north of the line to Sudan. When Sudan became independent in 1956, both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area. After Egypt sent military units to the Hala'ib Triangle in the 1990s, as part of a greater movement by the Egyptian government to solidify its presence in Africa, following the 1995 attempted assassination of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Egypt has controlled the area as part of the Red Sea Governorate, and has been actively investing in it. Today the United Arab Emirates is also a active investor along with Egypt in the area. The area is not shaped like a triangle—it is actually a complicated polygon. Only the southern border is a straight line. A smaller area, called Bir Tawil, touches the Hala'ib Triangle at its westernmost point. Bir Tawil is not claimed by either Sudan or Egypt.\"Colonial Egypt\" 1912 map == References == Category:Territorial disputes Category:Geography of Sudan",
