 "text": "Ultimate (often called Ultimate Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a non-contact team sport played with a 175 gram flying disc on a rectangular field. Opposing teams of 7 players try to move the disc into the opponent's end zone by throwing the disc to each other. A point is scored when one team catches the disc in the other team's end zone. A typical ultimate game will finish when one team scores fifteen points. Ultimate is most often played on grass or turf fields but can also be played on sand. == Game Length == An ultimate game is made up of two periods of play which are called halves. In a game played to fifteen points, the first half finishes when one team reaches eight points. A game of ultimate may finish before one team reaches fifteen points if there is a time cap. A time cap limits the duration of a game. == Rules and Spirit of the Game == The World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) controls the rules of play and game structure for international competitions. However, players of ultimate are individually responsible for upholding the rules of ultimate. Unlike other sports, there are no referees in ultimate. Players must call their own fouls or infractions and must resolve conflict by communicating directly with the opposing team. All players are expected to follow the Spirit of the Game, which describes how fair play is critical to ultimate. == Passing == The disc can only be moved by passing, but the player with the disc can pivot on one foot. If a pass is incomplete (touches the ground or is caught or knocked down by a defending player) or out of bounds, it is a \"turnover\" and the other team gets possession of the disc. ==References== == Other websites == *Ultimate Canada *USA Ultimate (USAU) *World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) Category:Team sports Category:Sports in the United States",
