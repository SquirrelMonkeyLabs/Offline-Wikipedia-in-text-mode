 "text": "Keller's foam-nest frog (Chiromantis kelleri) is a frog. It lives in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya. Scientists think it might live in South Sudan too. This is a large frog. There are dark spots on the sides of the body. Scientists thought this was the same species as Chriomantis petersii, but they changed their minds. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. The frog might be in some danger from humans building towns and cities and making places for animals to eat grass. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
