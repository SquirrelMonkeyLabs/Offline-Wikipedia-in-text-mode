He was formerly held in extrajudicial detention in the United States' Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba. In July 2013, a motion was filed seeking his release because his physical and emotional health had deteriorated to the point where he could be seen as a threat. On February 10, 2021, Idris died at age 60 at his mother's home in Port Sudan. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Sudanese people Category:Criminals",
