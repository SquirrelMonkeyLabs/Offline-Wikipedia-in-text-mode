 "text": "The Zhangxun Restoration was an attempt to restore the Qing Dynasty in July 1917. In 1911 after the Xinhai Revolution, the Qing Dynasty died. It was the last monarchy of China after thousands of years. The last emperor of the Qing was Puyi. General Zhang Xun tried to put Puyi back on the throne in 1917. Zhang got an army and entered Beijing. But it lasted only a few days, from July 1 to July 12. Troops from the Republic of China (1912â€“1949) quickly ended it. == Citations == Category:20th century in China Category:1917",
