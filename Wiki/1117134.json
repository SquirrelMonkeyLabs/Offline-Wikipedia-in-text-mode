From 1934–1941 his cousin Paul ruled as regent but when Yugoslavia joined the Axis powers, a pro Allied coup overthrew him and leaving the axis. The axis invaded Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav government went into exile. The government never returned to the country because a communist government, the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, was formed after the country was liberated.
