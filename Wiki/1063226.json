The Broncos first started playing in the stadium on August 11, 2001. In their first game, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 20â€“6 in a preseason game. When it was opened, the stadium was named Invesco Field at Mile High after sponsor Invesco from 2001 until 2011. The naming rights were then bought by Sports Authority and the stadium was renamed Sports Authority Field at Mile High from 2011 until 2018. From 2018-19, the stadium would just be called Broncos Stadium at Mile High with no sponsor. On September 4, 2019, Empower bought the naming rights for 21 years and the stadium was renamed Empower Stadium at Mile High. The stadium is 1 mile (5,280 feet (1,610 m)) above sea level which is why the stadium is nicknamed Mile High. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:National Football League venues Category:Buildings and structures in Colorado",
