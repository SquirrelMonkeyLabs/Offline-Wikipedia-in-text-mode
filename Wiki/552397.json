It is one of the longest river in Italy. ==Geography== The Reno river has a length of , and a drainage basin with an area of approximately . ===Course=== The Reno river starts in the Apennines to the northwest of the city of Pistoia, Pistoia province (Tuscany). The Reno is formed by the confluence, at about above sea level, of two streams: Reno di Prunetta (with its source at an altitude of ) and the Reno di Campolungo. Its upper course, going to the west, marks the border between Tuscany and Emilia- Romagna. In this part, there are several artificial reservoirs whose dams are used for hydro-electric energy production. In Sant'Agostino, the river turns to the southwest and passes west of Bologna, at Casalecchio di Reno. In its lower course the Reno receives the water of numerous streams, some of which are seasonal (they have water only when it rains) The Reno was a tributary of the Po until the middle of the 18th century when the course was changed to avoid the frequent floods. It now joins the Adriatic Sea near Casalborsetti, south-east of the Valli di Comacchio, a lagoon in the commune of Comacchio. The Reno flows through many municipalities; some of them in the lower course, in the Emilia-Romagna region, are: * Province of Bologna ** Porretta Terme ** Vergato ** Marzabotto ** Sasso Marconi ** Casalecchio di Reno ** Bologna * Province of Ferrara ** Cento ** Argenta ** Comacchio ==Main tributaries == The main tributaries of the Reno river are: Left tributaries: * Silla - 18 km * Samoggia - 44 km Right tributaries: * Limentra di Sambuca- 19.4 km * Eastern Limentra - 41 km * Setta - 47 km * Idice - 80 km ** Savena - 54 km, tributary of the Idice * Sillaro- 66 km * Santerno - 103 km, the most important by its length and its discharge of 16 mÂ³/s (570 cu ft/s). * Senio - 92 ==Gallery== Fiume-Reno-BO.jpg|The Reno near Sasso Marconi Reno a Molinella.JPG|The river near Molinella Fiume Reno a Porretta 1.jpg|The Reno river in Porretta ==Related pages== * List of rivers of Italy ==References== ==Other websites== * Gruppo di Stude Pianura del Reno website * Biblioteca idraulica italiana Category:Rivers of Italy",
