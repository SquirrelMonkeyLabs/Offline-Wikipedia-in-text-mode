Previously, the song \"I Got Love\" was released as a pre- single from the album on February 17, along with their video. Moments after the release, Taeyeon got all the songs from the digital album on the Korean record charts, with the single \"Fine\" on top of many. Just 8 hours after its release, the \"Fine\" clip reached 1 million views on YouTube, making it the singer's fastest video to reach that mark. On April 5th the album won a luxury edition titled My Voice DELUXE Edition. == Release == On February 15, S.M. Entertainment released a teaser of the \"I Got Love\" video, released on February 17 as a pre-single of My Voice. After announcing the release of Taeyeon's first album, S.M. began releasing teasers of My Voice songs, beginning with the song \"Love In Color\" on February 20th. The album was released on February 28, 2017, along with the song's first single from the album, \"Fine\". The album was re-released on April 5, 2017 as a deluxe edition, 3 new songs and a new track title \"Make Me Love You\" and with its single \"11:11\" which was released the previous year as a digital single. == Singles == The album features two singles and three video clips, one for the main single \"Fine\", another for the album's pre-single \"I Got Love\" and another for the single from the deluxe version of the album titled \"Make Me Love You\". The release of \"I Got Love\" was marked by the dark and sensual visual that Taeyeon had not yet shown to the public. In \"Fine\", Taeyeon shows his sensitive side, as already shown in previous releases, having the clip with a story that resembles that of his previous single, \"11:11\".
