Bennett held chairmanships and senior positions on a number of key Senate committees, including the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, Appropriations Committee, Rules and Administration Committee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Joint Economic Committee. Bennett was a popular conservative senator for most of his tenure, earning high ratings from conservative activist groups such as the National Rifle Association of America, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and American Conservative Union. However, in 2010 Bennett became one of the most prominent targets of the Tea Party Movement, which criticized his support of George W. Bush. Bennett died on May 4, 2016 at his home Arlington, Virginia after suffering from pancreatic cancer and a stroke. He was 82 years old. ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American Latter Day Saints Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Deaths from stroke Category:Politicians from Salt Lake City, Utah Category:United States senators from Utah Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians",
