 "text": "The Johore flying frog, green tree frog, jade tree frog or Jor flying frog (Zhangixalus prominanus) is a frog. It lives in Thailand and Malaysia. Scientists think it might also live in Sumatra. This frog lives in trees where the tree branches come together like a roof. The female frog lays eggs in foam. People have seen this frog between 250 and 1100 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not at risk of dying out because it lives in a large place. Some of the places it lives are protected parks: Endau-Rompin National Park, Taman Negara National Park, and Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
