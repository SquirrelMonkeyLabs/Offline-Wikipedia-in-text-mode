 "text": "Shōchū is a Japanese alcoholic drink. It is usually about 25 - 37% alcohol. Shōchū can be made from barley, rice, sweet potato, buckwheat, and sugar cane. It is made in many places in Japan, but started in Kyūshū. People drink it mixed with cold or hot water, over ice, in cocktails, or on its own. Shōchū is different from nihonshu, or sake. Rice shōchū is made from sake by increasing the purity of alcohol. Shochu comes in many flavors depending on the ingredients. == References == == Other websites == *https://www.satsuma.co.jp/english/con-shiru-shochu.html - A guide to shochu by a Japanese company Category:Alcoholic drinks Category:Japanese food",
