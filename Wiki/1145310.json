 "text": "Lalitaditya (originally Muktapida) was an 8th-century king of the Karkota Empire of Kashmir. Most of the information about him and his dynasty comes from the 12th-century writer Kalhan, who credited him of vast conquests and magical powers. He is said to have been built the Martand Sun Temple of Kashmir. == Early life == The Rajatarangini says Lalitaditya was the youngest son of King Durlabhaka and Queen Narendraprabha of the Karkota dynasty. His mother, Narendraprabha, was earlier married to a foreign merchant who had settled in Kashmir. Lalitaditya had two older brothers, Chandrapida and Tarapida. They ruled Kashmir before him. == Rule == Kalhana says Lalitaditya ruled for 36 years, 7 months, and 11 days. He says Lalitaditya's rule was from 724 to 761 CE. However, this timeline is likely wrong because Lalitaditya's predecessor is known to have sent a mission to the Tang capital, Chang'an, in 720 CE. This predecessor, called \"Tianmu\" in Tang records, was probably Tarapida. Some think it might have been Chandrapida. Modern historians estimate Lalitaditya's rule to be around 724/5 to 760 CE. == Military career == Kalhana has given a detailed account of Lalitaditya's military career. However, historians doubt it. They believe only a few of his conquest to be historical. According to them, Lalitaditya invaded Kannauj, the Kingdom of Yashovarman. He defeated him and captured all of his land. He also invaded Afghanistan and Punjab region. == Succession == He was succeeded by his son Kuvalayaditya, who ruled from c. 760-761 CE. == References == Category:8th- century births Category:8th-century deaths Category:Kings and queens Category:Indian monarchs",
