 "text": "Augustine Volcano is a high volcano located in southwestern Cook Inlet, approximately southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. Over half of Alaska's population lives within about of the volcano. It has erupted six times since the 1812 eruption: in 1883, 1935, 1964-65, 1976, 1986, and 2006. The 1976 and 1986 eruptions began with a series of vent-clearing explosions, followed by volcanic ash clouds rising into the sky. These were succeeded by eruptions of rocks and mudslides down the sides of the volcano. Unlike some prehistoric eruptions, the top of the volcano did not collapse during the eruptions in 1812, 1935, 1964-65, 1976, or 1986. However, in the 1883 eruption, a part of the mountain's summit broke off, triggering an avalanche that flowed down to the sea. This avalanche caused a small tsunami, which reached the Kenai Peninsula at English Bay, about east of the volcano. Clouds of volcanic ash pose a significant threat to jet aircraft operating at Anchorage International and other local airports. Ashfall from future eruptions could also disrupt oil and gas operations as well as shipping activities in Cook Inlet. Given its historical and prehistoric activity, similar eruptions are likely in Augustine's future. ==References== Category:Islands of Alaska Category:Mountain ranges of Alaska Category:Volcanoes of the United States",
