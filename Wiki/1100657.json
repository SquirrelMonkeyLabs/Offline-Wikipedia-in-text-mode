The agency employed about 837 people as of 31 December 2022 and releases around 1,000 new statistics each year through its website. These statistics are available in English and Norwegian. As the main source of official government statistics in Norway, Statistics Norway does research to support both the public and the government. While it is part of the Ministry of Finance, it does its work independently from other parts of the government. The agency has a board that is appointed by the government. It mostly uses data from national registers and also gets information through surveys and questionnaires, including data from cities and municipalities. == Other websites == * == References == Category:Organizations based in Norway",
