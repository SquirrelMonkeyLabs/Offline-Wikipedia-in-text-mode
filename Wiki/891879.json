 "text": "More than 200 players have scored three or more goals (a hat-trick) in a single match in the Premier League. The first player to score a hat-trick in the Premier League was Eric Cantona, who scored three times for the team Leeds United. Twenty-one players have scored more than three goals in a single match. Only five players (Andy Cole, Alan Shearer, Jermain Defoe, Dimitar Berbatov, and Sergio Agüero) have scored five goals in a single match. The person to score the most hat-tricks is Sergio Agüero with 12 hat-tricks (all for Manchester City). Sadio Mané made the fastest Premier League hat-trick, scoring three times in 2 minutes 56 seconds for the team Southampton against Aston Villa. Only six hat-tricks have been made in under 10 minutes. Those six were made by Sadio Mané, Robbie Fowler, Jermain Defoe, Gabriel Agbonlahor, Ian Wright, and Andy Carroll. Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored four goals in twelve minutes for the team Manchester United against Nottingham Forest. He was considered \"the fastest scorer of a four-goal haul on record in England\". Only six players – Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Didier Drogba, Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane (twice), and Erling Haaland – have scored hat-tricks in two league games in a row. Thierry Henry scored hat-tricks in two appearances in a row (which were a month apart, since he did not play for a month). 35 different players have scored a \"perfect\" hat-trick in the Premier League, and two players did this more than once: Robbie Fowler has done three (all for Liverpool) and Yakubu has done two (one for Blackburn Rovers and one for Everton). Erling Haaland of Manchester City joined this select group in only his fifth Premier League match on August 31, 2022. It was also his second consecutive hat trick. A perfect hat-trick is scoring a goal with the right-foot, left-foot, and head. The sometimes says that a player has not scored a hat-trick after the game already ended. For example, a goal that was thought to be a player's third goal was an own goal. ==Hat-tricks== Key 4 Player scored four goals 5 Player scored five goals Player scored hat-trick as a substitute D L Player's team did not win (D = Draw, L = Loss) P Player scored a perfect hat-trick Bolded The team the player who scored the hat-trick is on () Number of times player scored a hat-trick (only for players who scored more than one hat- trick) Premier League hat-tricks by player Player Nationality Home team Result Away team Date Ref.
