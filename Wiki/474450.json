 "text": "Linslade is a town in Bedfordshire, England. It is around one third of the way between London and Birmingham. It is located on the Bedfordshire side of the Bedfordshire-Buckinghamshire border. It is right next to the town of Leighton Buzzard. Together they form the civil parish of Leighton-Linslade. Linslade was transferred from Buckinghamshire in 1965. It was previously a separate urban district in its own right. It remained part of the Diocese of Oxford until 2008 when it joined Leighton Buzzard in the Diocese of St Albans. The original Anglo-Saxon settlement of Linslade was not located at the modern site. It is further north and survives today as the hamlet of Old Linslade. The present location, Linslade, experienced massive growth in the 1840s. This was associated with the construction of the Grand Union Canal and—particularly—the London and Birmingham Railway (now known as the West Coast Main Line). Linslade underwent a second major period of expansion, again associated with the railways, during the 1970s. As of the 2011 census there were 37,470 people living in Linslade.
