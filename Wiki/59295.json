 "text": "The President of Iran is the head of government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The president is chosen by direct popular vote, that is the voters choose the president, they do not vote for other people to choose as in the USA. Unlike other countries, in Iran, the President is not the leader of the country. The President does many of the things that are normally done by a head of state but the Supreme Leader is the person who is actually in control of the country. The current President of Iran is Masoud Pezeshkian since 28 July 2024. ==List== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ===Islamic Republic of Iran (from 1979)=== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== ====1st Constitution (19791989)==== Portrait Name Term of office Term of office Term of office Political party Election Previous office Prime minister Cabinet Portrait Name Took office Left office Time in office Political party Election Previous office Prime minister Cabinet The Council of the Islamic Revolution deputised during the interim (3 December 1979 4 February 1980).
