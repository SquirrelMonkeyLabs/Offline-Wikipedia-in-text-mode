Originally, JAC has several products line. The Heyue for sedans, hatchbacks, MPVs, and SUVs, the Refine for large MPVs/minivans and vans. In 2017, the Heyue series was discontinued and the final models were replaced by electric variants. In 2019, a new series, Jiayue, was introduced. Multiple Refine vehicles have been facelifted and moved to this series. In 2020, JAC started to rebadge JAC Jiayue series models to Sehol brand, resulted in the Sehol A5, Sehol X4, Sehol X7. The rebadge is in fact a move to move all sedans and SUV under the Sehol brand.
