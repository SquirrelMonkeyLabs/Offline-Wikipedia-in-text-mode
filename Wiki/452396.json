 "text": "An amplituhedron is a geometric shape that makes it easier to calculate particle interactions in quantum field theories. Currently, the limits of the N = 4 supersymmetric Yangâ€“Mills theory, which is used to calculate the amplituhedron, cause it to be a toy theory. Therefore, the application of the amplituhedron is limited in the real world. Category:Quantum mechanics",
