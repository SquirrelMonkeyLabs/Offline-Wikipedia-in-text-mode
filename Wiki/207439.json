 "text": "Zellers is a company owned by the Hudson's Bay Company. Until 2013 Zellers was Canada's second-largest chain of mass merchandise department stores. The headquarters were in Brampton, Ontario. They had a mascot named \"Zeddy\", which is a teddy bear. In 2011, the leaseholds of 189 Zellers stores were taken over by Target Corporation. Target got the leaseholds because they are expanding their stores into Canada in 2013 and 2014. HBC said most Zellers stores would close and retire the Zellers banner from Canadian retail by March 31, 2013. There were two Zellers stores left in Canada, in Toronto, and Ottawa Ontario, and they closed on January 26, 2020. In 2023, Hudson's Bay Company said that Zellers was going to open again in certain areas of Canada. These Zellers stores will be inside The Bay. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1931 establishments in Canada Category:Brampton, Ontario Category:Companies based in Ontario Category:Department stores of Canada",
