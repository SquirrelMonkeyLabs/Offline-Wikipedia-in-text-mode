 "text": "The Armsel Striker is a South African semi-automatic shotgun with a revolving cylinder somewhat like that of a revolver. It was made for both combat and riot control. The revolving cylinder allows the shooter to easily and quickly switch between lethal ammunition (ammunition made to kill living beings) and non-lethal ammunition (ammunition made to stop living beings without killing them). The cylinder can hold up to 12 shotgun shells. == References == Category:Shotguns",
