 "text": "The Division of Hunter is an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It is located in northern rural New South Wales. It covers much of the Hunter Valley region, including the towns of Singleton, Maitland, Muswellbrook, Cessnock and Denman. The Division was one of the original 75 divisions created for the first Federal election in 1901. The Division was named after Captain John Hunter, the second Governor of New South Wales. In 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission said that the Division of Hunter would be abolished at the next election. Because of population changes, New South Wales loses a division, and a new one will be created in Western Australia. The boundaries of many NSW divisions will have to be changed, and the area covered by Hunter will be added to nearby divisions. Under AEC rules however, names of the original 1901 divisions should be kept, so the Division of Charlton will be renamed Hunter.Australian Electoral Commission to abolish Federal NSW seat of Hunter: ABC 16 October 2015Draft federal redistribution of New South Wales: Poll Bludger ==Members== Member Party Term (Sir) Edmund Barton Protectionist 1901–1903 Frank Liddell Free Trade, Anti-Socialist 1903–1909 Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1910 Matthew Charlton Labor 1910–1928 Rowley James Labor 1928–1931 Lang Labor 1931–1936 Labor 1936–1958 H.V.
