 "text": "The WWE Women's Championship was a professional wrestling championship in World Wrestling Entertainment fought for by women's wrestlers. In 2010 the title was unified with the WWE Divas Championship and retired. A new WWE Women's Championship replaced the Divas title at WrestleMania 32 in 2016. It does not continue the histories of the old Women's Championship or the Divas Championship. == History == The WWF Women's Championship has descended from the National Wrestling Alliance World Women's Championship when The Fabulous Moolah became champion and held the title close to 30 years. The Title became inactive in 1990 when Rockin' Robin left the WWF. In 1993 Alundra Blayze won the title. However it became Inactive after Blayze dropped the title into a garbage can live on WCW Monday Nitro. This incident forced her to give up the title. The WWF Women's Championship was then reactivated in September 1998 when Jacqueline won a match against Sable. Layla, Michelle McCool, Mickie James, Melina and Beth Phoenix are the only women in the history of the WWE to hold both the WWE Women's Championship and WWE Divas Championship. ==Final champion== The final champion was Layla who defeated Beth Phoenix in a two-on- one handicap match with Michelle McCool on SmackDown and McCool self- proclaimed herself as the co-Women's Champion. The title was unified with the WWE Diva's Championship on September 19, 2010 and retired. ==Related pages== * World Wrestling Entertainment * WWE Divas Championship * WWE Women's Championship * Women's World Championship (WWE) == References == Notes == Other websites == * Official Title History at WWE.com Category:World Wrestling Entertainment championships",
