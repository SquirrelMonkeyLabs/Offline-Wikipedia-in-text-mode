 "text": "In human anatomy, and in mammals in general, the mons pubis (pubic mound, also known simply as the mons, and known specifically in females as the mons Venus or mons veneris), is a part of the body where the fatty tissue is found over the pubic symphysis of the pubic bones. The mons veneris is part of the vulva. The vulva is the part of the body where reproductive organs are located on the outside of the body. The mons pubis is one of many locations where pubic hair grows. ==Gallery== File:Pubic hair partly shaved genitalia.JPG|A mons pubis of a male with pubic hair partly removed.
