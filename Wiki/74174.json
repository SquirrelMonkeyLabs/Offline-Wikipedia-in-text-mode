 "text": "The Yanchep line (known as the Joondalup line prior to 14 July 2024) is a major public transport railway line in Perth, Western Australia. It runs through Perth's northern suburbs. The line was established in 1992 where it initially terminated at Joondalup. In 1993, it was extended to Currambine and in 2004 to Clarkson. A new station was completed in 2005 at Greenwood. The line was later connected with the new Mandurah railway line late in 2007, allowing passengers to ride in the same train to Mandurah without changing at Perth station to transfer between trains. In 2014 the line was extended to Butler and in 2024 it extended to its current terminus in Yanchep. Category:Australian railways",
