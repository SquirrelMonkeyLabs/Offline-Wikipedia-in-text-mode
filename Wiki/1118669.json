 "text": "Area Code 877 is a toll-free telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). It is used for toll-free numbers, meaning the person making the call does not pay for the call; instead, the receiving party pays. It entered service on April 4, 1998. It is one of several toll-free area codes in North America. Other toll-free area codes include 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, and 888. These codes are not tied to a specific geographic region and can be used anywhere in the United States, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan. Like all the other area codes in North America, companies use it to provide easy access to customer support, businesses use it for sales inquiries and placing orders, and organizations use it for hotlines and information lines.
