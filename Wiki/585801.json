 "text": "In Euclidean geometry, the Euclidean distance is the usual distance between two points p and q. This distance is measured as a line segment. The Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate this distance. ==Euclidean distance on the plane== In the Euclidean plane, if p = (p1, p2) and q = (q1, q2) then the distance is given by :d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=\\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2}. This is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem, where legs are differences between respective coordinates of the points, and hypotenuse is the distance. Alternatively, if the polar coordinates of the point p are (r1, θ1) and those of q are (r2, θ2), then the distance between the points is :d(\\mathbf{p},\\mathbf{q})=\\sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2 r_1 r_2 \\cos(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)}. == Related pages == * Norm (mathematics) * Polar coordinates == References == Category:Geometry",
