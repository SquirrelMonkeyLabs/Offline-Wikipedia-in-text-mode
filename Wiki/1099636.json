The adult male frog is 26.0â€“34.2 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is yellow-brown or red-brown in color. The iris of the eye is bronze in color. The male frog has an organ on its neck for making sounds and round, spike-like shapes on the back. This frog lives in evergreen forests. People have seen it between 1678 and 2166 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog lays eggs in pools of water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Pu Mat National Park in Vietnam. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
