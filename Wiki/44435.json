 "text": "Richard II (6 January 1367 â€“ 14 February 1400) was the son of Edward, the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, and Joan of Kent, \"The Fair Maid of Kent\". He was born in Bordeaux and became his father's successor when his elder brother died in infancy. Since his father died before him, he became king in 1377. His uncle John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, became regent until Richard could rule. He was deposed and made to abdicate in 1399 by Henry of Bolingbroke (Henry IV), John of Gaunt's son with Blanche of Lancaster. Richard was taken prisoner; and was killed in captivity later that year. William Shakespeare wrote a play about Richard II. Category:1367 births Category:1400 deaths Category:House of Plantagenet Category:14th century in England",
