 "text": "The Heisman Memorial Trophy Award (often known simply as the Heisman Trophy or The Heisman), named after the former college football coach John Heisman, is awarded annually to the most outstanding player in collegiate football. It was first awarded in 1935 by the Downtown Athletic Club of New York City. At the time, it was known as the DAC Trophy, with only players at colleges east of the Mississippi River eligible. A year later, after the death of Heisman (who had been the club's athletic director), the award was renamed the Heisman Trophy, and all college players became eligible. Since the DAC closed in 2002, the trophy has been presented by the Heisman Trophy Trust. All award ceremonies have been held in New York City except the 2020 ceremony, held virtually at ESPN's studios in Bristol, Connecticut amid COVID-19. == Other websites == *The Heisman Memorial Trophy Award website *StiffArmTrophy.com (attempts to project the Heisman Trophy winner through \"exit polls\" of actual Heisman voters) *HeismanPundit.com (commentary and discussion) *New Home of the Heisman - Sports Museum of America",
