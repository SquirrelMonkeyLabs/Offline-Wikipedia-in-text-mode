 "text": "Pantyhose is a piece of women's clothing that covers the waist down. Miniskirt exposed the legs to well above the knee. They made pantyhose a necessity for many women. In 1970, U.S. sales of pantyhose exceeded stockings for the first time, and it has remained so ever since. Pantyhose fit tightly. Modern tights come in different colors. For every day wear women are usually chosen brown (tan color pantyhose) or black or nude (skin) pantyhose. There are popular patterned pantyhose: for example, polka dot, backseam, tattoo and so on). In addition to beautiful trendy patterned pantyhose, there are also functional pantyhose, such as modeling and compression pantyhose. Compression pantyhose usually used for protective or medical reasons. For protection against varicose veins use only pantyhose with a low level of graduated compression. Compression pantyhose with a high level of exposure can be purchased with a doctor's prescription. == References == ==Related pages== *Tights Category:Underwear Category:Bottoms (clothing)",
