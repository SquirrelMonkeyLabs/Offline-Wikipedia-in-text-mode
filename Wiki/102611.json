 "text": "Narre Warren Railway Station is a railway station in Myki Zone 2, located in Narre Warren, Victoria. The station is on the Pakenham Line. == History == The station opened four years after the railway between Dandenong and Pakenham was built, on 10 March 1882. It was built as a single platform station. In 1956, a second rail from Dandenong was built, serving the new platform 2. In 1962, the new rail from Dandenong was extended to Berwick. In October 2004, the Narre Warren-Cranbourne Road underpass was built. In July 2021, a new Narre Warren station was proposed, this would move the station to a sky rail design, similar to those up the line at Carnegie, Murrumbeena, and etc. The construction started very soon after. The new station is said to be built by 2025. == References == Category:Premium Melbourne railway stations",
