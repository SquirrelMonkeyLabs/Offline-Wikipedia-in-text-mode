 "text": "Praline is a confection made from nuts and sugar syrup. They may be in whole pieces or a ground powder. The powder is called \"pralin\". Belgian pralines are different. They have a hard chocolate shell with a softer, sometimes liquid, filling. French pralines are a combination of almonds and caramelized sugar. American pralines have milk or cream. They are therefore softer and creamier, like fudge. ==References== Category:Confectionery",
