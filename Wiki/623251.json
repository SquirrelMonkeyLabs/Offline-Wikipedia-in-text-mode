 "text": "Memnon () was an Aethiopian king and an ally of the Trojans during the Trojan War. He was a demigod, the son of Tithonus and Eos, the goddess of the dawn. As a warrior, he was considered to be almost Achilles' equal in prowess and skill. During the Trojan War, Memnon himself slew Antilochus in the middle of a fierce battle and was himself later killed by Achilles. The death of Memnon appears to echo that of Hector, another defender of Troy whom Achilles had also slain. Category:People in Greek mythology",
