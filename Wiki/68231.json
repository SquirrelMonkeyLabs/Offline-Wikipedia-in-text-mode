The mantra was made well known even outside Hinduism by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The mantra can be found in many Hinduist traditions in India.

The mantra is contained in the texts of Hinduism known as the Upanishads, which are considered by some scholars to have roots in the Vedic past.Early Krishna- centered traditions are sometimes referred as Bhagavatism or Vasudevism - R D Ranade Mysticism in Maharashtra: Indian Mysticism,p.3: \"Vasudevism was indeed no new religion, see: Dr. Bhandarkar, as has been contended sometimes. It was merely a new stress on certain old beliefs which had come down from the days of the Vedas.\" == References == Category:Hinduism",
