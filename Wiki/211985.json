The colours are black and white. During its long history the club had departments for fencing, boxing, wrestling, cycling, handball, track and field, field hockey, tennis, football and water polo. The football team reached 3 times the Austrian Championship (1922, 1958, 1959). One of the greatest successes of the team was a 7:0 victory over Juventus Turin in the 1958 European Champions Cup (now UEFA Champions League). After 2.319 league matches and two insolvencies in the 1990´s the club slipped to lower leagues. In 2002 the football section split off and formed the Wiener Sportklub, who is currently playing in the Regionalliga Ost (3rd Division). Their homeground is the Wiener Sportclub-Platz in Viennas part Dornbach. The ground was built in 1904 and is the oldest ground in Austria, where are still matches. The northern stand of the ground is called \"Friedhofstribüne\" (graveyard stand) because he is just opposite the Dornbach cemetery. One of the club legends is Erich Hof, who played from 1954 till 1969 for the club. Later he was coach of the Austrian national football team and three times manager of the WSC. ==Honours== *Austrian Champion:1922,1958,1959 *Austrian Champion-runner up:1912, 1938, 1955, 1960, 1969, 1970, 1977 *Austrian Cup:1923 *Austrian Cup finals:1919, 1921, 1937, 1938, 1969, 1972, 1977 *Wiener Stadthallenturnier(indoor tournament):1962, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1973, 1976 ==Current squad== Category:Austrian football clubs Category:Football clubs of Vienna Category:1883 establishments in Europe Category:19th-century establishments in Austria",
