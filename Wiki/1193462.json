 "text": "The Mond process is a way to make pure nickel metal. It works because nickel easily reacts with carbon monoxide to make a volatile compound, while most other metals do not. It is an important example of a chemical transport reaction. == Process == The Mond process starts with impure nickel or nickel(II) oxide. This solid is treated with syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Hydrogen is a reducing agent that chanegs the oxide to the metal: : The metal reacts with the carbon monoxide, making a coordination complex called nickel tetracarbonyl: : Nickel tetracarbonyl is volatile: it easily becomes a gas. When the carbonyl sublimes, impurities like cobalt or iron are left behind. After it is separated from the impurities, the carbonyl gas is heated. At around , it breaks down back into the nickel metal and carbon monoxide: : The purified nickel metal crystallises onto a prepared surface. This surface can be an object to be plated with nickel, or a small piece of nickel that grows to make a larger, purer ingot. == Safety == The nickel tetracarbonyl made during the Mond process is very toxic. It is known to cause cancer and can be deadly if breathed in. Category:Chemical processes Category:Nickel",
