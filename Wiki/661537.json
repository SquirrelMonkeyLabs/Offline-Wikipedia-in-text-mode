 "text": "Antônio Hamilton Martins Mourão (born 15 August 1953) is a Brazilian politician and retired Army General who is the Senator for Rio Grande do Sul since 2023. He was the Vice President of Brazil from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2022. He held the highest post a Brazilian soldier can reach during peace time. He is also the son of General Antônio Hamilton Mourão and Wanda Coronel Martins. He retired from the military on February 28, 2018. Mourão is the first indigenous person who became vice president. On May 8, 2018, Mourão announced his membership of the Brazilian Labor Renewal Party (PRTB), and his plans to run for President of Brazil. However, in August of 2018, Mourão became the running mate of right-wing Presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. They won the second round of the election on 28 October 2018. Mourão is a controversial person mainly because of his support of the country's 1964–1985 military dictatorship. He has also disagreed with Bolsonaro publicly on many issues. This have led to calls for impeachment from Bolsonaro-supporting members of Congress. Many believe he may not be chosen as Bolsonaro's running- mate in the 2022 election. In June 2022, Bolsonaro picked Walter Souza Braga Netto as his 2022 running mate. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Vice presidents of Brazil Category:Brazilian generals Category:Politicians from Rio Grande do Sul",
