 "text": "The Oaxacan yellow tree frog (Megastomatohyla pellita) is a frog. It lives in Mexico. It lives in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in Oaxaca. The adult male frog is 25.2â€“27.3 mm long from nose to rear end and at least two female frogs were 28.6 and 31.6 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is yellow-brown in color. There are darker marks on its sides. This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Humans cut down trees for wood or to build farms or houses or make places for cows and other animals to eat grass. They are also dying from disease. They are also dying because new frogs from other places eat all the food. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
