He was one of the early figures in the modern development of hatha yoga in India and the United States. In 1918, he founded The Yoga Institute, which is considered the world’s oldest organised yoga centre. He is sometimes called the Father of the Modern Yoga Renaissance. He helped bring back the practice of asanas (yoga poses) and worked to make yoga more accessible to the general public. Shri Yogendra introduced new ways of teaching yoga and supported research, especially in the area of yoga therapy. He wrote several books on yoga and started a journal called Yoga in 1933. He also wrote poetry under the pen name Mastamani and translated Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali into Gujarati language. He died in Mumbai on 25 September 1989 at the age of 91. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Indian educators Category:Indian writers Category:Indian Hindus Category:Indian religious leaders",
