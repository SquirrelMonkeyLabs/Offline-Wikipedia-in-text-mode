 "text": "Prince Carl Philip of Sweden, Duke of Värmland (Carl Philip Edmund Bertil, born 13 May 1979), is a Swedish prince. He is the second child of three children and only son of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden. He was born in Stockholm Palace at Stockholm County, He held the title of Crown Prince of Sweden for seven months, because Sweden had male-preference primogeniture (brothers inherit before sisters). On 1 January 1980 the Act of Succession was changed to introduce absolute succession. Since then, Carl Philip has been second in the line of succession after his elder sister, Crown Princess Victoria. However, because the United Kingdom still has male- preference primogeniture for people born before 2011, Carl Philip is ahead of his elder sister in the line of succession to the British throne. Carl Philip was christened at The Royal Palace Church on 31 August 1979. His godparents are Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and Princess Birgitta of Sweden. He married Sofia Hellqvist on 13 June 2015.
