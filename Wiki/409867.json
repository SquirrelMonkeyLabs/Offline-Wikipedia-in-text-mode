 "text": "Newcastle Falcons (formerly Gosforth/Newcastle Gosforth) are a rugby club based in Newcastle, England who play in the Premiership Rugby. The club was formed in 1877 as Gosforth Football Club and were well known for their successes in cup competition. The advent of League rugby saw their first name change to Newcastle Gosforth as well as a move to the Kingston Park. At the start of the professional era the club adopted its current name of Newcastle Falcons and in 1998 they won the Premiership within a year of winning promotion from the second tier, a feat that has yet to be repeated. ==League position== Season League Position 2010/11 Aviva Premiership 11th 2011/12 Aviva Premiership 12th 2012/13 RFU Championship Champions ===Former position=== Category:English rugby union teams Category:1877 establishments in England Category:Organisations based in Newcastle upon Tyne",
