 "text": "A hydrazone is the functional group with structure R1R2C=NNH2. They are like aldehydes or ketones, with an NNH2 group instead of the oxygen atom. They are made by reacting hydrazines with ketones or aldehydes: : Hydrazones are very useful molecules to do some reactions. For example, a ketone can be reduced down completely if made into a hydrazine and then treated with sodium ethoxide (Wolffâ€“Kishner reduction). Hydrazones are very important intermediates in many reactions, such as the Fischer indole synthesis. This makes indoles, groups which are found in many drugs. Category:Functional groups",
