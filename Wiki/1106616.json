It is common for the term Liberated Zone or Soviet Zone to be used, although these terms are used to describe any territory controlled by the CCP in Chinese history until 1949. == History == In 1927, far-right nationalist forces controlled by Chiang Kai-Shek purged left-wing nationalist forces and members of the CCP in Shanghai. After breaking with the Kuomintang, Mao Zedong and Zhu De declared on November 7, 1931 to establish bases in the Jinggang Mountains and later repelled to Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. After the fall of communist control over Jiangxi and other territories in southern China, Zhou Enlai (responsible for military planning) organized a successful withdrawal. With the formation of the Second United Front, the Chinese Soviet Republic was de jure dissolved, but still existed, controlling regions in northern China. == Territories == At first, communist forces controlled Jiangxi and Fujian, which within the Soviet organization were respectively called the Jiangxi Soviet. After the Long March when the communists went north, they only kept Yan'an. ==References== Category:1930s in China",
