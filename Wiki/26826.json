 "text": "Nyx was the goddess of the night in Greek mythology. She came out of Chaos. Her Roman equivalent was Nox. == Hesiod's Theogony == In his theogony (How the gods came to be), Hesiod tells: Night is born of Chaos; her offspring are many, and telling. With Erebus, Night gives birth to the following deities: * Aether (\"atmosphere\") and Hemera (\"day\"). Later, on her own, Night gives birth to * Momus \"blame\" * Ponos \"toil\" * Moros \"fate\" * Thanatos \"death\" * Hypnos \"sleep\", * the Oneiroi \"the tribe of dreams\" * the Hesperides * the Keres and Fates * Nemesis \"retribution\" * Apate \"deception\" * Philotes \"friendship\" * Geras \"age\", * and Eris \"strife\". In his description of Tartarus, Hesiod says further that Hemera \"day\", who is now Night's sister rather than daughter, left Tartarus just as Nyx entered it; when Hemera returned, Nyx left. This mirrors the portrayal of Ratri \"night\" in the Rig-Veda, where she works in close cooperation but also tension with her sister Ushas \"dawn\". == Children == * Only hers: **Hypnos, the god of sleep. ** Thanatos, the god of death. ** Apate, the god of deception. ** Eris, the god of strife. ** Geras, the god of age. ** Momus, the god of blame. ** Moros, the god of fate. ** Philotes, the god of friendship. ** Ponus, the god of toil. ** Reopus, the god of negativity ==Related pages== * Nox - Etruscan mythology version of Nyx. == References == Category:Greek gods and goddesses Category:Gods and goddesses of the underworld",
