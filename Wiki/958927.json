 "text": "In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication. F(x)=f(x)g(x) F'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x). == Steps == Say we have the function F(x)=(x^2+3)\\cos(x). The two functions being multiplied are x^2+3 and \\cos(x). We can set f(x)=x^2+3 and g(x)=\\cos(x). The rule needs us to find the derivative of both f(x) and g(x). We can find f'(x) by first using the sum rule to split f(x) into x^2 and 3 . After using the power rule, we have f'(x)=2x . To find g'(x), we need to find the derivative of \\cos(x), which is -\\sin(x), meaning g'(x)=-\\sin(x). Now we can substitute the values into the equation, F'(x)=2x\\cos(x)-\\sin(x)(x^2+3). == Proof == One definition of a derivative is F'(x)=\\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{F(x+h)-F(x)}{h}}, and we're trying to find the derivative of f(x)g(x), so we can first set F(x) to f(x)g(x). \\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x)g(x)}{h}} We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation. \\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h)-f(x+h)g(x)+f(x+h)g(x)-f(x)g(x)}{h}} The -f(x+h)g(x)+f(x+h)g(x) part is equal to 0 , meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor, \\lim_{h\\to 0}{f(x+h)}\\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}}+\\lim_{h\\to 0}{g(x)}\\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}, and because h approaches 0 , \\lim_{h\\to 0}{f(x+h)} is equal to f(x). {f(x+h)}\\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}}+{g(x)}\\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}, and \\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}} and \\lim_{h\\to 0}{\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}} are just equal to g'(x)and f'(x). F'(x)=f'(x)g(x)+g'(x)f(x). ==References== Category:Calculus",
