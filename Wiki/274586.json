 "text": "British Malaya is an area around the Malay Peninsula and Singapore Strait that was colonized by the British. It was the world's largest maker of tin and rubber. There were three parts to the British Malaya; Straits Settlements, Federated Malay States, and the Unfederated Malay States. It was replaced with the Federation of Malaya in 1947 and given independence in 1957. It was formed into Malaysia in 1963. The British started trade in this area around 1800. It became more of a British colony by the later 1800s. Malaya was an important source of rubber and other plant products. The Empire of Japan invaded and conquered Malaya and Singapore in December 1941. Malaya remained under Japanese control for the rest of World War II, with Occupied Singapore as the capital.",
