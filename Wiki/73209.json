Both seasons officially ended on November 30, 2006. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. ==Storms== ===Tropical Storm Aletta=== On May 27 Tropical Depression One-E formed.

Other Systems ===Tropical Storm 91C=== On October 28, 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone stalled over the northeast Pacific Ocean and began to strengthen. By October 31, the storm had acquired tropical characteristics, including an eye, convection, and a warmer-than-average core.The system reached peak intensity on November 1, before slowly weakening and looping towards the Pacific Northwest. The system made landfall in Washington state on November 3, before rapidly weakening and dissipating on the next day. During the duration of the storm, the system was known as Storm 91C. The storm's true nature still remains controversial among meteorologists today, due to disputes over the storm's exact structure and whether or not it had obtained tropical or subtropical characteristics. Because the storm was not within the area of responsibility of the National Hurricane Center or the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, it was never assigned a name. == Storm names == The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2006. This is the same list that was used in the 2000 season. There were no names retired from the northeast Pacific list. Therefore, the same list was reused in the 2012 season. * Aletta * Bud * Carlotta * Daniel * Emilia * Fabio * Gilma * Hector * Ileana * John * Kristy * Lane * Miriam * Norman * Olivia * Paul * Rosa * Sergio * * * For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2006 are shown below, however only the name Ioke was used. * Ipot * * * === Retirement === The name Ipot was retired from the north-central Pacific list by the PAGASA in the spring of 2007 and replaced with Indang. During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Philippines State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Dumudura, citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat of damage. However, the request was denied, as the name remains on the tropical cyclone naming list. == Season effects == This is a table of all the storms that formed in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2006 USD. {{TC stats cyclone3|cat=storm|name=Ninety-One-C|dates=October 28 - November 4|max-winds=65 (100)|min-press=989|areas=Northwest Pacific|damage=None|deaths=None}} ==Related pages== *2006 Atlantic hurricane season ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * National Hurricane Center's Eastern Pacific Tropical Weather Outlook - updated four times daily * National Hurricane Center * National Hurricane Center's 2006 Advisory Archive * Central Pacific Hurricane Center Category:2006 Pacific hurricane season",
