 "text": "The Rogues are a DC Comics team made up of enemies to the Flash. They were created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, first appearing in The Flash #155 (1965). They individually struggle against the Flash, but are able to defeat him by working together. Despite their status as super-villains, they operate with a strict code of honor enforced by their leader Captain Cold. The original group included Captain Cold, Heat Wave, Mirror Master, Captain Boomerang, Pied Piper, and the Top. There have been several line-ups since then under a variety of leaders.
