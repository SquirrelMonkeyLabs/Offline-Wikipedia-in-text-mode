 "text": "Objectivism in poetry is about a group of American poets who came together in the 1930s. Poets in this group \"tend to use language more literally than figuratively, presenting concrete objects for themselves rather than as embodiments [forms] of abstract ideas.\" The name itself, \"objectivism,\" was only meant to be a label for these poets who had almost the same understanding of what poetry can do. Poets such as Louis Zukofsky, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Reznikoff had very different ways of writing their own poems, but Zukofsky said they \"felt sympathetic towards each other.\" In 1931, Zukofsky wrote an introduction and printed poems by many of these poets in Poetry magazine. ==References== Category:Poetry",
