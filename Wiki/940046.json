A very small minority also live in Xinjiang, China and Tajikistan. Dardic is a geographical phrase, not a ethnic or linguistic one. It is not used by any of its speakers. Dardic languages are mostly Indic, but have a huge amount Iranian loanwords from Pashto, Yidgha, or Ormuri. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Pakistan",
