A Portuguese document from January 1781 reported the Maratha armada as comprising 14 palas and 32 galvetas, though this figure likely exaggerated their strength. A contemporary newsletter indicated they had five palas, two Gurabas, and 17 other vessels, led by Dhulap with support from Sardar Kushtaji Naik. The flagship Fatehjung was armed with 28 guns and crewed by 175-200 men, while other ships carried fewer guns and sailors. During their initial clash near Kalyanpur, the Marathas suffered casualties, including the death of Mahomed Sarang, and faced resistance from Santana, which had 40 guns and a crew of 120 musketeers. The Marathas also captured two Portuguese chalupas and a trading ship, resulting in heavy Portuguese losses and the eventual surrender of Captain Francisco de Costa, who was severely injured. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:18th-century battles",
