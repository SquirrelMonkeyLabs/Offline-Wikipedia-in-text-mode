In 1954, Applewhite was drafted by the United States Army and served in Austria and New Mexico as a member of the Army Signal Corps. Applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which said that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and put humans on Earth and would return to collect some people.
