He was a two-time college football national champion at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. He was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. Many people consider the 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers, on which Phillips played, to be the greatest college football team of all time. Phillips played in the National Football League for the St. Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins, and San Francisco 49ers from 1996 through 1999, and for the Montreal Alouettes and Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League in 2002 and 2003.
