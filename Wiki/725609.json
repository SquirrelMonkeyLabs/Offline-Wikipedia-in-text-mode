 "text": "The New Testament says Eunice was the mother of Timothy. She was born as a Jew. She and her mother Lois later accepted Christianity. She is only mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:5, in which the author writes to Timothy, \"I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.\" (ESV) Many people who have commented on Eunice have also connected Eunice to 2 Tim. 3:15, where Timothy is reminded \"how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings\". For example, (ESV) Albert Barnes says \"The mother of Timothy was a pious Hebrewess, and regarded it as one of the duties of her religion to train her son in the careful knowledge of the word of God.\" == References == Category:Pauline epistles Category:New Testament people",
