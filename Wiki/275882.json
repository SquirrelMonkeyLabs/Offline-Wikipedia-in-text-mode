 "text": "Antimony trifluoride, also known as antimony(III) fluoride or Swart's reagent, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is SbF3. It has antimony and fluoride ions in it. The antimony is in its +3 oxidation state. ==Properties== Antimony trifluoride is a light gray solid. It dissolves easily in water. It is very corrosive. It has a strong odor. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting antimony trioxide with concentrated hydrofluoric acid or by reacting antimony with a little fluorine. ==Uses== It is used to add fluoride ions to other chemical compounds in organic chemistry. A Belgian chemist reacted a chloride with antimony trifluoride and chlorine to make a fluoride from the chloride. It was used to make Freon. It is also used in pottery and dyeing. ==Safety== Antimony trifluoride is highly corrosive. It is acidic and can burn the digestive system. It also makes ulcers. ==Related pages== *Bismuth trifluoride *Antimony tribromide Category:Antimony compounds Category:Fluorine compounds",
