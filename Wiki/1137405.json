 "text": "Anime Insider (first known as Anime Invasion until 2003) was an American monthly anime and manga magazine. It ran from 2001 until 2009. It was published by Wizard Entertainment. The magazine started out as a quarterly issue but then moved to a monthly issue later on. It ran under the name Anime Invasion but they had to change their name in 2003 because they did not want to infringe on a trademark that another company was using. The magazine was produced in Congers, New York. The first issue, released in Fall 2001, spotlighted Dragon Ball Z. The editorial staff was laid off. The last issue was in 2009, with the main feature being a video game edition on Mega Man. ==References== ==Other websites== *Archive of the Official website Category:2001 establishments in the United States Category:2009 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct magazines of the United States Category:Monthly magazines",
