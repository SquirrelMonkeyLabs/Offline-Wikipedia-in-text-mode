 "text": "A tantrum (also known as temper tantrum, lash out, meltdown, fit or hissy fit) is an emotional expression or outburst. It is usually connected with those in emotional distress, that is represented by stubbornness, crying, screaming, violence, defiance, angry ranting, an effect from making attempts to calm. Sometimes, tantrum can also make a person to hit others and other physically violent behavior. Physical control in tantrum may be lost. The person may be unable to keep being still; and even if the purpose of the person is met, they may not be calmed. Throwing a temper tantrum can lead to a child getting detention or being suspended from school for older school age children. Tantrum may also be expressed in a long violent, angry outburst of talk, a stretched out or angry speech. Certain conditions, such as autism and ADHD can increase the risk of a child throwing a tantrum or a meltdown. Contrary to popular belief, tantrums and meltdowns are not the same thing. As opposed to a tantrum, a meltdown happens when the child loses control in terms of behavior and can only be stopped when the child tires themselves out or if a parent calms them down. == Sources == == Other websites == * Category:Emotions Category:Childhood Category:Violence Category:Habits",
