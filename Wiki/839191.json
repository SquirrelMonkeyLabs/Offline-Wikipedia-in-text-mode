He is the co-founder of the file-sharing computer service Napster, and serving as the first president of the social networking website Facebook. He also co-founded Plaxo, Causes, Airtime.com, and Brigade, an online platform for civic engagement. == Early life == Parker was born in Herndon, Virginia, United States. When Parker was seven, his father taught him how to program on an Atari 800. Parker's father, who put his family before his entrepreneurial dreams, told Parker \"if you are going to take risks, take them early before you have a family.\" At his teenager, Parker's hobbies were hacking and programming. One night, while hacking into the network of a Fortune 500 company, Parker was unable to log out after his father confiscated his computer keyboard. Because his IP address was exposed, F.B.I. agents tracked down the 16-year-old. Since Parker was under 18, he was sentenced to community service, and this make him to feel he will be someone in future. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American chief executives Category:American company founders",
