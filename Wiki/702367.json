 "text": "Samuel Jefferson Jones (April 16, 1827 December 10, 1883) was a pro-slavery man who was the Douglas County sheriff in Kansas Territory from late 1855 until early 1857. He helped create the territorial capital of Lecompton. He was an important person in the \"Bleeding Kansas\" conflict. In 1858, he moved to La Mesilla, New Mexico Territory. In September 1858, he was chosen to be the collector of customs at Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Ju√°rez). In New Mexico, he was involved with the promotion of Mowry City. When that town's future failed, he bought a ranch near La Mesilla and died there in 1883. His grave was later returned to Lecompton in 2013. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Bleeding Kansas",
