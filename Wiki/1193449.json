 "text": "Dymaxion Map Projection The Dymaxion map projection, also known as the Fuller projection, is a method of displaying the globe developed by American architect and futurist R. Buckminster Fuller. First introduced in 1943 and later refined with collaborator Shoji Sadao in 1954, the projection maps Earth’s surface onto the faces of a regular icosahedron—a polyhedron with 20 equilateral triangular faces—which is then unfolded into a flat, two- dimensional layout. The Dymaxion projection is designed to minimize distortion of landmasses and spatial relationships. Unlike traditional projections, such as Mercator or Robinson, the Dymaxion map is not oriented with north at the top and does not divide the world into hemispheres. Instead, it allows for multiple orientations and shows the continents as an almost-continuous landmass, emphasizing global interconnection and reducing perceived cultural or geopolitical hierarchies. This projection preserves relative area and shape of continents more accurately than many common rectangular projections, though it does distort direction and distance between points. It does not preserve angular relationships (i.e., it is not conformal), but it offers a compelling alternative for viewing global geography in a way that reduces visual bias. The Dymaxion map has been influential in design, education, and systems thinking. It has been used to advocate for a unified view of Earth, often referred to in Fuller’s work as “Spaceship Earth.”",
