Today it can be found in four African countries It is an initiatory order. This means that people join it by initiation. The group tries to cause the spiritual purification of all that exists. This is done by cleaning all the bodies of a person, the spiritual, astral and physical, at the same time. It is done using sound and divine light. Techniques and codes are used which allow contact with any entity existing . According to Ntinu, there have been no spiritual masters and true prophets in the black race for years. To him, this explains their ignorance of the size of the universe. == Notes and references == == Bibliography == * Category:Meditation Category:New religious movements Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo",
