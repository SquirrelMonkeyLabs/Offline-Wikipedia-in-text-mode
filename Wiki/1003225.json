 "text": "Stegocephali is a group containing all four-limbed vertebrates. The word was first used in 1868 by the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, who used it as a general category of prehistoric amphibians. This did not get used by other people. In 1998 the Canadian paleontologist Michel Laurin used the word and gave a formal phylogenetic definition. This was intended to include taxa with digits rather than fins, except where secondarily lost.Michel Laurin (1998): The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution.
