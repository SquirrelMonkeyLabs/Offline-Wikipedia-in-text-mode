 "text": "The Java bubble-nest frog or gold-striped tree frog (Philautus aurifasciatus) is a frog. It lives in Indonesia. People have only seen this frog higher than 900 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a big place. It lives in forests high up in the hills. Some of the places it lives are in protected parks. This frog lays eggs in holes in trees. It hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
