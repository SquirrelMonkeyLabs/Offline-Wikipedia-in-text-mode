 "text": "Screen burn-in, image burn-in, ghost image, or shadow image is damage on a Television or Monitor screen, which happens from when a static image does not change for a long period of time. When the content on the screen is changed, the long-unchanged image from before may still remain. This damage happens a lot more in older screens, where the technology at the time made it a lot more likely to occur. Even with the name, the screen does not actually burn. Rather, the pixels of the screen permanently stay on the screen, as they were before. A similar problem is image persistence on hd tvs like plasmas and oled ==References== Category:Television technology",
