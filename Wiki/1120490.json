 "text": "Cybersex trafficking is a cybercrime that involves sex trafficking, and the live streaming of coerced sexual acts or rape on webcam. It is also known as live streaming sexual abuse pp. 1â€“4. and webcam sex tourism/abuse Cybersex trafficking is different from other sex crimes. Victims are transported to 'cybersex dens'. These are locations with webcams and internet-connected devices with live streaming software. There, victims are forced to perform sexual acts on themselves or other people in sexual slavery. They may also be raped by the traffickers or assisting assaulters, with the attack being streamed live videos. Victims are frequently ordered to watch the paying live distant consumers or purchasers on shared screens and follow their commands. It is a commercialized, cyber form of forced prostitution. p. 43. Women, children, and poor people are particularly vulnerable.The images or movies generated may be child pornography. The activities are filmed and broadcast in real time and can be recorded. == Victims == The victims are mostly women and children. They are abducted, threatened, or deceived. Some of them are drugged. Those who are of a lower class, discriminate race, minority, or other social disadvantages have a higher risk of becoming a victim. Cybersex trafficking that affects girls and women has also been called \"digital gender violence\" or 'online gender-based violence.' In certain countries, victims are still prosecuted, even though they were forced. === Captured victims in sex dens === When victims are kidnapped or abducted, they are locked up. They are put in room that either has no windows at all, or where the windows are covered. There always is a webcam. They experience physical and psychological trauma. The webcam records everything they do. Gang rape has occurred on webcam. Some are forced to have sex with family members or close relatives. When they refuse to do something, or they don't perform well, they are denied food or deprived of sleep. Sometimes, they are forced to perform even though they are sick. While they are in captivity, they get infected with diseases. An example of a disease they get is tuberculosis. A number are assaulted or tortured. Setting up what is called a 'cybersex den' is not difficult: All that is needed is a webcam, a computer, a mobile phone, a tablet or similar device and an internet connection. These locations, commonly referred to as 'cybersex dens,' can be in homes, hotels, offices, internet cafes, and other businesses. Because it is so easy to set up a cybersex den, it is extremely difficult or impossible for law enforcement to identify. The number of cybersex trafficking victims is unknown. Some victims are simultaneously forced into prostitution in a brothel or other location. ==== Freeing victims ==== Some of the victims are children. When they are exploited, this is called commercial sexual exploitation of children. When parents want to rescue their children, they often need help. After they are rescued, the children are often separated from their families. They then start a new life in what is called a shelter. === Free victims === Not all victims are transported elsewhere, and held captive. Sometimes, people fall prey to blackmailing and sextortion. They are threatened, webcam blackmailed, or bullied to film themselves committing sexual acts online. Victims have been forced to self-penetrate. This has been called 'rape at a distance.' Others are deceived, including by phony romantic partners who are really rape or child pornography distributors. They are made to film themselves masturbating. The videos are live streamed to purchasers or recorded for later sale. == References == Category:Violence against women Category:Sexual abuse Category:Sex industry Category:Sex crimes Category:Rape Category:Child sexual abuse Category:Child labour",
