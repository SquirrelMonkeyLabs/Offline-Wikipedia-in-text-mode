 "text": "The Rochechouart crater is a place in France where a meteorite, a rock from outer space, hit the surface of the Earth, leaving a crater. The meteorite hit came during the Jurassic or Triassic period. Rochechouart is between the Haute-Vienne and the Charente. The last four estimates (since 2010) are converging toward an age between 203 and 207 million years, in the Rhaetian, two to five million years older than the TriassicJurassic boundary. Some scientists think that the Rochechouart crater is part of a group of five craters that happened at about the same time. They think a large meteor or comet broke into pieces and many of the pieces hit the Earth. ==References== Category:Craters Category:meteorites",
