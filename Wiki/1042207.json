 "text": "The Canary damsel (Similiparma lurida) is a species of marine fish of the family Pomacentridae. It lives mostly in shallow, subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, and is sometimes also known as the Cape Verde gregory, which is also a common name of Stegastes imbricatus. ==Description== Each fish has large eyes, with coloring that is black to brownish black with blue on the fins, and lighter colors on the bottom part of the body. Juveniles may have side stripes on their bodies as well. During their mating season, adults exhibit sexual dimorphism. ==Distribution and habitat== Canary damsels are commonly associated with reefs in subtropical areas, where individuals grow to around 15 cm in length, and feed mostly on algae and small invertebrates.Reiner, F. (1996): Catálogo dos peixes do Arquipélago de Cabo Verde. Publicações avulsas do IPIMAR No. 2. 339 p. It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, specifically near Macaronesia (Madeira, Azores, Savage Islands Canary Islands, Cape Verde) and Senegal at depths to about . Canary damsels live in rocky areas, where they lay eggs that are defended by males. The young can be found along the coast, especially in tide pools.Quignard, J.-P. & Pras, A. (1986): Pomacentridae. p. 916-918. In P.J.P. Whitehead, M.-L., Bauchot, J.-C., Hureau, J.N. & Tortonese, E. (eds.) Fishes of the north-eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. UNESCO, Paris. Vol. 2. ==Relationship with humans== The Canary damsel is sometimes harvested for use in saltwater aquaria on a very small scale. Its total population size is unknown and it faces no known threats from humans. It is also found in many marine protected regions. This fact, together with a non-fragmented range, and no evidence of population decline, has led the IUCN to classify the Canary damsel as \"Least Concern.\" File:Abudefduf luridus.jpg File:Fula negra (Abudefduf luridus), Madeira, Portugal, 2019-05-31, DD 43.jpg File:Abudefduf luridus1.jpg ==References== Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Pomacentridae",
