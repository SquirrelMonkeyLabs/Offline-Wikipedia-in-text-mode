 "text": "The Sacramento River is the longest river in California in the United States. It flows through the Sacramento Valley in northern California, and is about long. The Sacramento has many tributaries, including the Pit, Feather and American Rivers. Cities along the river include Redding and Sacramento. Native people have lived in the region for about 12,000 years. The Sacramento River's tributaries were the focus of the California Gold Rush, which brought many settlers to the area in the 1800s. Today, the river is used as a source of irrigation water and to produce hydroelectricity. ==Tributaries== *Cache Creek *Putah Creek *American River *Feather River **Bear River (Feather River) **Yuba River *Pit River **McCloud River ==Related pages== *Shasta Dam Category:Rivers of California Category:San Francisco Bay Area Category:Sacramento County, California Category:Contra Costa County, California Category:Solano County, California Category:Siskiyou County, California Category:Shasta County, California Category:Tehama County, California Category:Butte County, California Category:Glenn County, California Category:Colusa County, California Category:Sutter County, California Category:Yolo County, California Category:Central Valley of California Category:Sacramento, California",
