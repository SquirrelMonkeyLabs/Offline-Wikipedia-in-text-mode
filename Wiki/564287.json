 "text": "Palisade cells are special cells in the leaves of plants. They are the main place where photosynthesis takes place. They absorb light so photosynthesis can take place. They have the largest number of chloroplasts per cell of any plant tissue. They convert the light to chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. The cells are just below the epidermis and cuticle.
