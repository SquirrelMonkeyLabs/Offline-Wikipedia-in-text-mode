 "text": "Saint Matthew's Church () is a protected church building. It is located in the Vasastaden district in the town of Stockholm in Sweden. The building was originally intended to be a chapel in the Adolf Fredrik Parish. The church was designed by Erik Lallerstedt. It was built at an intersection in Vasastaden between 1901-1903. The large hall at ground floor was originally meant to be used for various charity-activities. This was thought because the chapel was located in a poorer neighbourhood at the time. The church building is in many ways reminiscent of the Methodist church Saint Peter's Church at Norrmalm. The Saint Peters Church was also designed by Erik Lallerstedt in 1899. The Saint Matthew's Church underwent some changes between 1907â€“1908 under guidance of the original architect. The changes occurred when the parish was split and the chapel became a parish church. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:Churches in Stockholm Category:Church of Sweden churches",
