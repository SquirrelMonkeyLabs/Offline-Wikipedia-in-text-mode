 "text": "There are 4 arrondissements in the Nièvre department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. The arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Nièvre department are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 581 Château-Chinon (Ville) Château-Chinon (Ville) 25,717 1,929.1 80 582 Clamecy Clamecy 24,993 1,464.0 84 583 Nevers Nevers 118,087 2,020.3 82 584 Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire 44,772 1,403.3 63 ==History== Since its creation, the Nièvre department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the Nièvre department with nine districts: Nevers, Saint- Pierre-le-Moutier, Decize, Moulins-Engilbert, Château-Chinon, Corbigny, Clamecy, Cosne and La Charité; Nevers was the capital. * 1800 : the nine districts were changed into four arrondissements: Nevers, Château-Chinon, Clamecy and Cosne. * 1926 : the arrondissement of Cosne was eliminated but in 1943 it became again an arrondissement of the department; later, its name was changed to Cosne-sur-Loire and, finally, Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire. ==Related pages== *Arrondissement of Château-Chinon (Ville) *Arrondissement of Clamecy *Arrondissement of Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire *Arrondissement of Nevers *List of arrondissements of France ==References== Nievre",
