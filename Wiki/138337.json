 "text": "There are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem. * One is used by the cryptographic community. * The other is a general meaning which is how the word cryptosystem is understood by the public. == General meaning == In this meaning, the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand, or as an abbreviation for \"cryptographic system\". A cryptographic system is any computer system that involves cryptography. Such systems include for instance, a system for secure electronic mail which might include methods for digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key management techniques, and so on. == Meaning in the cryptographic community == In this meaning, a cryptosystem refers to a set of algorithms needed to implement a method of encryption and decryption. Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: # Key generation algorithm. # Encryption algorithm. # Decryption algorithm. The term cipher (sometimes cypher) is often used to refer to a pair of (encryption/decryption) algorithms. Therefore, the term \"cryptosystem\" is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important. For this reason, the term \"cryptosystem\" is commonly used to refer to public key techniques; however both \"cipher\" and \"cryptosystem\" are used for symmetric key techniques. == \"Cryptographic system\" vs. \"cryptosystem\" == The Internet Security Glossary RFC 2828 advises against using the term \"cryptosystem\", giving the following definitions. ;cryptosystem :(D) ISDs SHOULD NOT use this term as an abbreviation for cryptographic system. (For justification, see: crypto.) ;crypto :ISDs SHOULD NOT use this abbreviated term because it may be misunderstood. Instead, use \"cryptography\" or \"cryptographic\". ==References== Category:Cryptography",
