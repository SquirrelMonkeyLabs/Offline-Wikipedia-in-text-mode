 "text": "Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof was one of the most important train stations in Berlin in the 20th century. Today there is the underground station with the same name in Berlin. Before the World War II, the station had connections to central and southern Germany, Austria and Italy. The station building was damaged in the Bombing of Berlin in World War II. The remains were demolished in 1959 even after public protests. The \"Anhalter Bahnhof\" associated Berlin with the Princely or Duchy of Anhalt, today part of the federal state Saxony-Anhalt. == References == Category:20th century in Berlin Category:Buildings and structures in Berlin",
