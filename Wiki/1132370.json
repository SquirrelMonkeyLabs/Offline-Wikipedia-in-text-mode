 "text": "The agouti is any of several rodent species of the genus Dasyprocta. They are native to Mexico, Central America, northern and central South America, and the southern Lesser Antilles. Some species have also been introduced elsewhere in the West Indies. They are related to guinea pigs and look quite similar, but they are larger and have longer legs. The species vary considerably in colour, being brown, reddish, dull orange, greyish, or blackish, but typically with lighter underparts. Their bodies are covered with coarse hair, which is raised when alarmed. They weigh and are in length, with short, hairless tails.Emmons, L. H. (1997). Neotropical Rainforest Mammals.
