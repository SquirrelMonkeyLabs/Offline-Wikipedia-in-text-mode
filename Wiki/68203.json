 "text": "The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. (Sarajevo is now in Bosnia and Herzegovina.) Other candidate cities were Sapporo, Japan and Falun, Sweden. It was the first Winter Games and the second Olympics held in Eastern Europe (the first was the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow). The Olympics would have a positive impact on Sarajevo. Shortly after however, the Bosnian War and siege of Sarajevo would take place and would leave tens of thousands dead. A lot of venues that were built for the Olympics were either destroyed or badly damaged in the war. Some buildings were repaired but some like the bobsleigh track had to be abandoned because of the risk of landmines. ==References== == Other websites == * IOC page for the 1984 Winter Olympics Category:1984 in Europe Category:20th century in Bosnia and Herzegovina",
