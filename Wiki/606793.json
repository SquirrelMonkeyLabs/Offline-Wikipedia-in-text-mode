 "text": "The President of the Republic of Singapore is the country's head of state. Singapore has a parliamentary system of government. Executive authority is exercised by the Cabinet who was led by the Prime Minister of Singapore. The current president is Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who was elected with the 70% of the vote at the 2023 presidential election. The president's official residence and office is the Istana. However, no presidents since Yusof bin Ishak (1965–1970) have lived there. The current president, Halimah Yacob, had wanted to stay in the HDB flat at Yishun, but if she fails to comply with the security requirements, she will have to move out. She is also the first female President of Singapore and first Malay head of state in 47 years since the death of Mr Yusof bin Ishak who was Singapore's first president. == List of presidents of the Republic of Singapore == N Portrait President Start of term End of term Election Political Party (Before Resignation) 1 Sir William Goode 9 June 1959 9 December 1959 1959 2 Yusof Ishak 9 December 1959 23 November 1970 1963 3 Yeoh Ghim Seng (1918 —1993) 23 November 1970 2 January 1971 — 4 Benjamin Sheares 2 January 1971 12 May 1981 1972, 1976, 1980, — Yeoh Ghim Seng (1918 —1993) 12 May 1981 23 October 1981 — 5 Devan Nair 23 October 1981 28 March 1985 1984, 6 Wee Chong Jin (1915 —2005) 28 March 1985 29 March 1985 — — Yeoh Ghim Seng (1918 —1993) 29 March 1985 2 September 1985 — 7 Wee Kim Wee 2 September 1985 1 September 1993 1988, 1991, 8 Ong Teng Cheong 1 September 1993 31 August 1999 1993 9 S.
