 "text": "Myst is a computer game designed by the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller in a company called Cyan. The Millers started working on Myst in 1991 and released it for the Macintosh computer on September 24, 1993. Myst was later released on many different computers and video game consoles. In Myst, the player starts by using a special book to travel to Myst Island. There, the player uses other special books to travel to different worlds called \"Ages\". Solving puzzles on different Ages helps the player learn more about Myst Island and the people who live there. The player can make choices that change the ending of the game. When Myst was released, it became very popular. Critics loved Myst because it felt like a real world. Myst was the best-selling computer game until The Sims was released in 2000. Myst helped the CD-ROM get more popular when the CD-ROM was new. Because Myst was so popular, four sequels were made, and three Myst novels were written. ==References== Category:1993 video games Category:3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Classic Mac OS games Category:IOS games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games",
