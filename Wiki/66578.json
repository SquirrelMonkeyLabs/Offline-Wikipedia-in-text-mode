 "text": "Kingdom of Urartu (Assyrian: māt Urarṭu, Babylonian: Urashtu, Hebrew: אֲרָרָט, Ararat), was an Iron Age kingdom. Territory of the ancient Kingdom of Urartu extended over the modern frontiers of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and the Republic of Armenia. Its center was the Armenian highland between Lake Van, Lake Urmia, and Lake Sevan. During the seventh century, the Urartians collaborated with a combination of Scythians and Cimmerians in their jockeying for power, but by 590, having been weakened in the constant rivalry between Assyrians, Babylonians, Scythians, and Medes, Urartu was swallowed by the Medes. ==Urartu and Armenians== Armenians are the heirs of the Urartians. A. E. Redgate says that the Urartians are the \"most easily identifiable\" ancestors of the Armenians. Philip D. Curtin defined the Kingdom of Urartu as an Armenian kingdom. == Maps == Map Year 860–840 BC 820–785 BC 785–753 BC 745–735 BC 743 BC 735–715 BC 713–680 BC 680–610 BC 610–585 BC == References == == Sources == * * * * * Category:Ancient Armenia Category:Former monarchies of Asia Category:Former countries in the Middle East Category:6th-century BC disestablishments",
