 "text": "The Salmon River, often called the \"River of No Return,\" is a major river in Idaho, USA. It flows for about 425 miles (684 km) through rugged, mountainous terrain, making it one of the longest free-flowing rivers in the contiguous United States. Known for its wild rapids and deep canyons, including North America’s second-deepest canyon after the Grand Canyon, the Salmon River is a popular destination for whitewater rafting, fishing, and wilderness adventures. The river’s ecosystem supports a variety of wildlife, including salmon, which travel upstream to spawn. The surrounding area is remote, with much of the river passing through the Frank Church–River of No Return Wilderness, one of the largest wilderness areas in the U.S. Category:Rivers of Idaho",
