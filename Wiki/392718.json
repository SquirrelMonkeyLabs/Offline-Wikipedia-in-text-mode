He met John Bates and they recorded the song Annihilator together. Waters and Bates recruited drummer Paul Malek and bassist Dave Scott into the band but Bates and Scott left a year later. The band released their first studio album Alice in Hell on April 17, 1989. They released their second studio album Never, Neverland on September 12, 1990. Both Alice in Hell and Never, Neverland are considered masterpieces of Canadian heavy metal. Annihilator is the highest selling heavy metal artist in Canadian history, even though most of the sales have not been in the band's home country. == Band members == ;Current *Jeff Waters - lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar (1984–present) *Dave Padden - vocals, guitar (2003–present) ;Live *Alberto \"Al\" Campuzano – bass (2010–Present) *Mike Harshaw – drums (2012–Present) ;Former *John Bates – Lead vocals (1984–1985) *Dave Scott – Bass guitar (1984–1985) *Paul Malek – Drums (1984–1985, 1986) *Richard Death – Drums (1985) *Dennis Dubeau – Lead vocals (1987–1989) *Ray Hartmann – Drums (1987–1992, 1999–2001) *Randy Rampage – Lead vocals (1989, 1998–2000) *Dave Davis – Guitar (1989–1991, 1993–2001) *Wayne Darley – Bass guitar(1989–1993) *Coburn Pharr – Lead vocals (1990–1992) *Neil Goldberg – Guitar (1992–1993) *Aaron Randall – Lead vocals (1992–1994) *Mike Mangini – Drums (1993, 2004–2005, 2007) *Randy Black – Drums (1993–1996, 2002–2003) *Cam Dixon – Bass guitar (1994–1995) *Lou Bujdoso – Bass guitar (1995–1996) *Dave Machander – Drums (1996) *Russell Bergquist – Bass guitar (1999–2003, 2005–2007) *Joe Comeau – Lead vocals (2000–2003) *Curran Murphy – Guitar (2002–2005) *Sandor de Bretan – Bass guitar (2004) *Rob Falzano – Drums (2004) *Tony Chappelle – Drusm (2005) *Alex Landenburg – Drums (2007) *Brian Daemon – Bass guitar (2007) *Carlos Cantatore - Drums (2010) == Discography == ===Albums=== *Alice in Hell (1989) *Never, Neverland (1990) *Set the World on Fire (1993) *King of the Kill (1994) *Refresh the Demon (1996) *Remains (1997) *Criteria for a Black Widow (1999) *Carnival Diablos (2001) *Waking the Fury (2002) *All for You (2004) *Schizo Deluxe (2005) *Metal (2007) *Annihilator (2010) * Feast (2013) * Suicide Society (2015) * For the Demented (2017) * Ballistic, Sadistic (2020) ==References== == Other websites == *Official website Category:1980s music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:1990s music groups Category:2000s music groups Category:2010s music groups Category:Canadian heavy metal bands Category:Canadian thrash metal bands Category:Speed metal bands Category:Progressive metal bands",
