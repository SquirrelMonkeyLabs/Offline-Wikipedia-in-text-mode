He ran for president before in 2016. In December 2020, Christie told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that he could run in 2024. On March 16, 2023, Christie announced that he would decide running for president within 45 to 60 days. Christie visited New Hampshire in late March, saying it was to see if he's ready to compete. Christie ended his campaign on January 10, 2024 after low polling numbers and pressure to drop out to help Nikki Haley win New Hampshire. ==References== Christie",
