In the early year of 1996, Bill Gates introduced MSN Gaming Zone which would be on at MSN Broadband. == History == The first version of the site, known as \"The Village,\" was started by Kevin Binkley, Ted Higgs, and Hoon. In 1996, an employee of Microsoft Steve Murch convinced Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer to buy the game site, which was owned by Electric Gravity. The site was renamed to \"Internet Gaming Zone\" and released in 1996. === Discontinuation === On January 10, 2009, MSN Internet Access was removed from Windows XP and Windows 2000 because it no longer ran MSN Gaming Zone. On July 31, 2019, later after the release, Microsoft announced that they would no longer continue servicing the MSN Internet Games Zone for Windows XP and Windows ME. It was removed from Windows Vista on August 2, 2019, and from Windows 7 on January 22, 2020, after 5 days of ending support. == Related pages == * MSN == References == == Other websites == * MSN Games homepage * The book about MSN Zone by Dorothy Rosencrans Category:Browser-based game websites Category:Microsoft websites",
