He wrote the song about his addiction to OxyContin and the way that he acted and treated people when he was under the influence of drugs. A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Dean Karr. In the video, the band plays in a room full of mirrors. A man wakes up and sits in a trashed room. He lies in bed while a demon version of himself holds him down. He leaves the apartment and walks down the street, seeing the demon version staring back at him when he sees his reflection. He bumps into people as he walks. The man enters a social gathering and goes to the bar, meeting a woman and seeing that she is also a demon. He gets angry and destroys the room. The man wakes up in the destroyed room again. The song along with \"Riot\" appear on the soundtrack to the video game WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2006 songs Category:Three Days Grace songs Category:Songs about drugs Category:Alternative rock songs",
