 "text": "Earphones or earbuds are a small type of headphones and audio devices that people wear in their outer ear. Earphones are lighter and more portable than headphones. They let people listen to music on a walkman, MP3 player, mobile phone or computer. Earphones that are worn inside the ear canal are called In- ear headphones or In-ear monitors. They typically have better sound quality. Earphones often use a small plug for connection. Category:Audio technology Category:Ear",
