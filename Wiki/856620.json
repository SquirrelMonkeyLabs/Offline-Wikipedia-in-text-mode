 "text": "Lichess is free and open-source Internet chess server. The chess server is run by a non-profit organization, which is also called Lichess. The Lichess chess server was created in 2010 by Thibault Duplessis. The name comes from a combination of \"live/light/libre\" and \"chess\". It's called \"live\" because games are played and are able to be watched in real-time, 24/7. The term \"light\" is because Lichess keeps a simplistic user interface, and the term \"libre\" is French for \"free\", as in \"free and open-source software (FOSS)\". Players online have the option of playing anonymously. They also have the option to create an account to earn a rating. Lichess uses the Glicko-2 rating system. In April 2021, the United States Chess Federation reviewed how Lichess deals with cheating in online chess. After this review, it endorsed Lichess as a secure place to play chess for its members. ==Titled Arenas== Lichess runs tournaments called Titled Arenas, in which only players who have a title are able to play. As of February 2021, World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen has the most Titled Arena wins, with 15. ==References== ==Other websites== * The Lichess website Category:Chess Category:French websites",
