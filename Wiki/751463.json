It evolved into a separate campaign group which launched on the 12th November 2019 however it is still supported by UKSCN's School Group Developmental working group and the wider volunteer base. Teach the Future has garnered support for their English Climate Emergency Education Act through running a parliamentary reception; Nadia Whittome is the campaign parliamentary sponsor and helped them run the aforementioned event to unveil their legislation to the government. The campaign's work being supported by multiple influential organisations - included the RSPB, British Youth Council, Global Action Plan, National Union of Students and Friends of the Earth.
