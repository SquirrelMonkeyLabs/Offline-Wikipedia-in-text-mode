 "text": "The Megalopyge opercularis is a moth of the family Megalopygidae. It has a lot of common names, like asp caterpillar, puss caterpillar, woolly slug and puss moth. This caterpillar is very dangerous because of its venomous spines. Touching its fur-like spines makes an immediate skin irritation. The pain is like bee, wasp or hornet stings. A lot of the reactions stay in the area that touched the caterpillar. However, the reactions are usually severe. The reaction causes burning, nausea, headache, rashes, vomiting and blisters. These caterpillars are seen from southeast Virginia to Florida and as far west as Missouri and Texas. They are also in Mexico and Central America. If you are stung by a puss moth, asp caterpillar or puss caterpillar, get first aid right away. The spines need to be removed using cellophane tape. You can also use baking soda, ice packs or calamine lotion for the sting. ==References== Category:Moths",
