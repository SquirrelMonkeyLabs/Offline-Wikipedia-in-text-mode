 "text": "The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season was an above average season in terms of ACE and damage but most storms were weak and short lived. The season began when Tropical Storm Alberto formed on May 19, 2012. Four days later, Tropical Storm Beryl developed. It became a subtropical storm and on May 27, was upgraded to a tropical storm. This is the first time since the 1908 Atlantic hurricane season that two storms formed before the official start date. The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and ended on November 30, 2012. There were no storms formed in the month of July. == Storms == === Tropical Storm Alberto === Tropical Storm Alberto formed on May 19, 2012. It became an \"early season storm\" because it formed before the official start of the season. Tropical Storm Alberto dissipated on May 22 without making landfall. Its maximum sustained winds was at 60 miles per hour. === Tropical Storm Beryl === Tropical Storm Beryl developed. It became a subtropical storm and on May 27, was upgraded to a tropical storm. It hit Jacksonville, Florida. === Hurricane Chris === Hurricane Chris was the third tropical system. It formed on June 19. It was also the first hurricane of the season, unexpectedly becoming one. It was in an unfavorable environment, with cool sea waters and moderate vertical wind shear. Chris, after weakening from a hurricane, became a non-tropical cyclone southeast of Newfoundland on June 22. === Tropical Storm Debby === This system became the record earliest 4th storm, which was broken in 2012. The storm made landfall in Florida, and caused bad flooding. Ten people died. ==Timeline of events== ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/2012 till:01/12/2012 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2012 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_<39_mph_(0–62_km/h)_ id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117 km/h)_ id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(119–153_km/h)_ id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h)_ id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–129_mph_(178–208_km/h)_ id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130–156_mph_(209–251_km/h)_ id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_≥157_mph_(≥252_km/h)_ Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:19/05/2012 till:22/05/2012 color:TS text:\"Alberto (TS)\" from:26/05/2012 till:30/05/2012 color:TS text:\"Beryl (TS)\" from:19/06/2012 till:22/06/2012 color:C1 text:\"Chris (C1)\" from:23/06/2012 till:27/06/2012 color:TS text:\"Debby (TS)\" from:01/08/2012 till:10/08/2012 color:C2 text:\"Ernesto (C2)\" from:04/08/2012 till:06/08/2012 color:TS text:\"Florence (TS)\" barset:break from:09/08/2012 till:11/08/2012 color:TD barset:break from:17/08/2012 till:18/08/2012 color:TS text:\"Helene (TS)\" from:15/08/2012 till:20/08/2012 color:C2 text:\"Gordon (C2)\" from:21/08/2012 till:01/09/2012 color:C1 text:\"Isaac (C1)\" from:22/08/2012 till:24/08/2012 color:TS text:\"Joyce (TS)\" from:28/08/2012 till:02/09/2012 color:C2 text:\"Kirk (C2)\" from:30/08/2012 till:11/09/2012 color:C1 text:\"Leslie (C1)\" from:03/09/2012 till:11/09/2012 color:C3 text:\"Michael (C3)\" barset:break from:11/09/2012 till:22/09/2012 color:C1 barset:break from:23/09/2012 till:04/10/2012 color:C1 text:\"Nadine (C1)\" from:03/10/2012 till:05/10/2012 color:TS text:\"Oscar (TS)\" from:11/10/2012 till:13/10/2012 color:TS text:\"Patty (TS)\" from:12/10/2012 till:17/10/2012 color:C1 text:\"Rafael (C1)\" from:22/10/2012 till:29/10/2012 color:C3 text:\"Sandy (C3)\" from:22/10/2012 till:25/10/2012 color:TS text:\"Tony (TS)\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/2012 till:01/06/2012 text:May from:01/06/2012 till:01/07/2012 text:June from:01/07/2012 till:01/08/2012 text:July from:01/08/2012 till:01/09/2012 text:August from:01/09/2012 till:01/10/2012 text:September from:01/10/2012 till:01/11/2012 text:October from:01/11/2012 till:01/12/2012 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\"(From the\" pos:(617,30) text:\"Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale)\" ==Storm names== The following names were used for named storms in the North Atlantic in 2012.
