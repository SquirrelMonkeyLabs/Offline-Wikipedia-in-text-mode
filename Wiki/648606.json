Neither the wider nor the central district are current administrative units but there is a West Ham electoral ward covering part of the central area. West Ham lies within the traditional boundaries of the county of Essex. It became part of the London Borough of Newham in 1965. ==Related pages== * West Ham station * West Ham United F.C.",
