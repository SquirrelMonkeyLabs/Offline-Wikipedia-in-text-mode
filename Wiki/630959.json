 "text": "Warfarin (sometimes sold as Coumadin) is a powerful water-soluble compound. It prevents blood from clotting. It does that by reducing the production of factors by the liver that promote clotting. It is called an \"anticoagulant agent\". It is a powerful rat poison. In concentrated form, it causes bleeding of internal organs which leads to death. It is also used, in very low doses, to prevent thrombosis in humans. This is the local coagulation or clotting of the blood in the circulatory system. In such cases, it makes heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary embolism less likely. The degree of anticoagulation is monitored by blood tests. A form of rat poison, similar to this one, is used in the novel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes to kill multiple people, such as in the arena, and in the book's finale, where Coriolanus poisons the schoolmaster with rat poison from behind a friends bar. == References == Category:Drugs Category:Blood Category:Organic compounds Category:Poisons",
