It enters and leaves Texas twice. The Union Pacific Railroad's Tucumcari Line (former Southern Pacific and Rock Island Lines \"Golden State Route\") go parallel to US-54 from El Paso to Pratt, Kansas. That part makes up about two-thirds of the route. The highway's eastern endpoint is at Interstate 72 in Griggsville, Illinois. Its western endpoint is El Paso, near the United States-Mexico border. ==Route description== |- |TX (El Paso) |20 |32 |- |NM |355 |571 |- |TX (Panhandle) |92 |148 |- |OK |56 |90 |- |KS |380 |612 |- |MO |279 |449 |- |IL |24 |38 |- |Total |1206 |1940 |} ==References== ==Other websites== * Endpoints of U.S. Highway 54 * Kansas Highway Maps: Current , Historic , KDOT Category:U.S. Highways",
