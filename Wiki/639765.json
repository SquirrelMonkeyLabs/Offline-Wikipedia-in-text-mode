The movie stars Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Kristin Chenoweth with Emma Thompson and Linda Hunt. The main plot follows Harold Crick (portrayed by Ferrell), an IRS worker who begins hearing a disembodied voice narrating his life as it happens – seemingly the text of a novel in which it is stated that he will soon die – and he frantically seeks to somehow prevent that ending. The movie was shot on location in Chicago. It was released by Columbia Pictures on November 10, 2006 and made $53.7 million at the box office. Roger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars and praised Ferrell's performance. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2006 fantasy movies Category:2006 comedy-drama movies Category:2000s American fantasy movies Category:Movies shot in Chicago Category:Movies set in Chicago Category:2000s English-language movies Category:Columbia Pictures movies Category:Movies directed by Marc Forster",
