 "text": "Evermore (styled in lowercase) is the ninth studio album by American recording artist Taylor Swift. It was released on December 11, 2020, as a \"sister\" album to her previous record, Folklore, which was released just a few months prior. It was produced by Swift, Aaron Dessner, Bryce Dessner, and Jack Antonoff. Evermore became Swift's seventh US number-one album, earning 329,000 units there in its first week. Its lead single, \"Willow\", became her seventh Billboard Hot 100 number-one song. Its music video was released the same day as the album. There are currently 17 tracks on Evermore including two \"deluxe version\" songs. Evermore crosses the lines between real and imaginative by drawing a story along the lines of each song while still being able to relate it to Swift's life. == References == Notes Category:2020 albums Category:Taylor Swift albums",
