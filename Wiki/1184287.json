 "text": "Organic peroxides are organic compounds (chemicals containing carbon) that contain a peroxide functional group. This means that they have a pair of oxygen atoms with a bond to each other and each bonded to something else. They are like hydrogen peroxide with one or both hydrogen atoms replaced by carbon. If one of the oxygens is bonded to hydrogen, the compound is a special type of organic peroxide called a hydroperoxide. Organic peroxy acids are called acyl peroxides. == Preparation == Acyl peroxides can be prepared from carboxylic acids by reaction with hydrogen peroxide . Autoxidation, or reaction with oxygen in the air, changes many organic compounds to peroxides or hydroperoxides. This is also called peroxidation. Peroxidation is used to make some chemicals, like in the cumene process, but can also be dangerous when unstable peroxides form in solvents like diethyl ether. == Uses == Organic peroxides are sometimes used when making plastics or rubber; Those peroxides can also be used in sanitation applications. == Safety == Organic peroxides are unstable. The bond between the oxygen atoms can break, releasing heat. This reaction occurs faster the warmer the peroxide is. Because they release heat as they break, organic peroxides can cause a runaway reaction: each reaction releases heat, which speeds up the reaction for other molecules. Above a particular temperature, called the self-accelerating decomposition temperature, the rate of this heating is faster than how quickly the chemical can lose heat to its surroundings. This can cause violent reactions including fires and explosions. ==References== Category:Functional groups Category:Oxygen compounds Category:Organic compounds",
