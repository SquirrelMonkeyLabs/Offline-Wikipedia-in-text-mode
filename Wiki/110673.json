 "text": "The Romanian Revolution of 1989 was a week-long series of violent riots and fighting in Romania. It took place in late December of 1989. The fighting began to end Nicolae Ceauşescu's control of the Communist state. In 1989, similar revolutions ended Communist governments in other countries in Eastern Europe. Revolutions in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Albania were peaceful, but in Romania, the revolution was violent and led to the deaths of many, including Ceausescu.
