 "text": "The 2016 presidential campaign of John Ellis \"Jeb\" Bush, the 43rd Governor of Florida, was formally launched on June 15, 2015, coming six months after announcing the formal exploration of a candidacy for the 2016 Republican nomination for the President of the United States on December 16, 2014, and the formation of his Right to Rise PAC. It is headquartered in Miami, Florida. He suspended his campaign on February 20, 2016. ==Background== There has been speculation that Bush would make a run for President since the end of the 2012 election. Speculation was fueled when Bush announced he would be \"actively exploring\" a run for President on December 16, 2014 and resigned from several corporate boards. It has been further speculated that Bush has put off formally announcing a candidacy in order to raise unlimited amounts of money for his Right to Rise Super PAC, and prepare strategy; once formally a candidate, Bush cannot coordinate with PACs or Super PACs under campaign finance law. He suspended his campaign on February 20, 2016. == Announcement and preliminary campaign == On June 4, the same day of Governor Rick Perry's formal campaign announcement, an anonymous Bush staffer leaked that Bush would formally announce his candidacy on June 15. Bush made a trip to Germany, Poland, and Estonia before returning to begin his campaign. On June 15, 2015, Bush formally announced his candidacy at Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus, in Miami, Florida. Bush embarked on a tour following his June 15 announcement, with stops in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. The Bush campaign cancelled events in Charleston, South Carolina in light of the June 17 mass shooting. ==Fundraising== On July 9, 2015, at a campaign fund-raising conference in the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush announced that super PACs which support his candidacy, mainly Right to Rise, had received a total of $103 million during the previous six months. The campaign itself had received $11.4 million, $700,000 a day, during its first two weeks. ==References== Bush",
