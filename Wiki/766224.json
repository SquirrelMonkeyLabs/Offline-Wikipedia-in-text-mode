 "text": "The Cape Melville tree frog (Ranoidea andiirrmalin) is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in the Melville Range mountains on Cape Melville in Queensland. These frogs live in fields of boulders near rainforests. They are difficult for people to study because the mountains are hard to climb. As of 2004, they had only been found in four streams. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
