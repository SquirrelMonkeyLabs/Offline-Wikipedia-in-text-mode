From 2004 to 2014 it made cheap laptops so that children in less rich countries without as much technology can also use a computer to learn. Their XO laptop had an operating system called sugar based on GNU/Linux. It also ran Windows. Since 2014, the organization mainly gives out Chromebooks. == References == Category:Non- profit organizations of the United States",
