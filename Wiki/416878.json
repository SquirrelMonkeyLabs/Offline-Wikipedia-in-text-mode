The attack happened at around 8:20 a.m. in Building 197. Alexis was shot dead by police after he shot at them. It was the second-deadliest mass murder on a U.S. military base after the Fort Hood shooting in November 2009, and the deadliest mass murder in the Washington metropolitan area since the September 11 attacks in 2001. ==References== Category:2013 murders in the United States Navy Yard shooting Category:2010s mass shootings in the United States Navy Yard shooting Category:Massacres in the United States Category:Murders by firearm in the United States",
