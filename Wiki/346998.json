 "text": "The Crafoord Prize is an annual science prize established in 1980 by Holger and Anna-Greta Crafoord. It is administered by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The prize is for \"international basic research in the disciplines Astronomy, Mathematics, Geosciences, and Biosciences, with particular emphasis on ecology, and rheumatoid arthritis\" (the disease from which Holger severely suffered in his last years). According to the Academy, \"these disciplines are chosen so as to complement those for which the Nobel Prizes are awarded.\" Only one award is given each year, according to a rotating scheme – astronomy and mathematics; then geosciences; then biosciences. A Crafoord Prize is only awarded for arthritis when a committee decides that substantial progress in the field has been made. On Crafoord Day in April, the prize is presented by the King of Sweden, who also presents the Nobel Prize Awards at the ceremony in December. The prize is to fund further research by the prize winner. In 2012 it is US$600,000. == Winners == Year Category Image Laureate Nationality Work 1982 Mathematics Vladimir Arnold Theory of non-linear differential equations 1982 Mathematics Louis Nirenberg Theory of non-linear differential equations 1983 Geosciences Edward Lorenz Geophysical hydrodynamics 1983 Geosciences — Henry Stommel Geophysical hydrodynamics 1984 Biosciences Daniel Janzen Co-evolution 1985 Astronomy Lyman Spitzer Studies of the interstellar medium 1986 Geosciences — Claude Allègre Isotope geochemical relations 1986 Geosciences — Gerald J.
