 "text": "WWE Clash of Champions was a series of professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming shows made by WWE from 2016 to 2020. It was named after Clash of the Champions, which were television specials made by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Like with Night of Champions, most matches at these events were championship matches. In 2018, an all-female event, WWE Evolution, took place instead. Clash of Champions returned the following two years. ==Dates and venues== Raw-branded event SmackDown-branded event # Event Date City Venue Main Event Ref. 1 Clash of Champions (2016) September 25, 2016 Indianapolis, Indiana Bankers Life Fieldhouse Kevin Owens (c) vs. Seth Rollins for the WWE Universal Championship 2 Clash of Champions (2017) December 17, 2017 Boston, Massachusetts TD Garden AJ Styles (c) vs. Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship 3 Clash of Champions (2019) September 15, 2019 Charlotte, North Carolina Spectrum Center Seth Rollins (c) vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship 4 Clash of Champions (2020) September 27, 2020 Orlando, Florida WWE ThunderDome at Amway Center Roman Reigns (c) vs. Jey Uso for the WWE Universal Championship ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:WWE Category:World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view events Category:2016 establishments in the United States Category:2020 disestablishments in the United States",
