 "text": "Antifreeze is a liquid that lowers the freezing point of water. It is used to stop ice from growing on a surface, like a windshield. It is also used inside pipes of a car's radiator. As the temperature outside changes from hot to cold coolant is pumped throughout the engine block to maintain an even operating temperature. Antifreeze does more than just regulate temperature, however. Maintaining proper fluid levels also helps to prevent corrosion. Engine coolant is mixed with water, usually at a 50/50 ratio, and poured into the proper reservoir in your engine. The chemical ethylene glycol is used as a base to create a liquid that is pumped through your carâ€™s engine to regulate and maintain an optimal operating temperature during extreme hot or cold weather conditions. ==References== Category:Automotive technologies Category:Chemicals",
