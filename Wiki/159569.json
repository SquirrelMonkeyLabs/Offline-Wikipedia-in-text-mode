 "text": "The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye was signed on 10 September 1919 by the winning Allies and the new Republic of Austria on the other. Austria lost large amounts of territory to the Allies after it lost World War I. Like the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, the treaty contained the Covenant of the League of Nations and so the United States did not ratify either of them.
