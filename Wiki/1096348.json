 "text": "The 1969 People's Park protest, also known as Bloody Thursday, took place at People's Park on May 15, 1969. The Berkeley Police Department and other officers fought with protestors over the site of the park, using deadly force. Ronald Reagan, then-governor of California, eventually sent in the state National Guard to stop the protests. One person was killed while he was visiting friends in Berkeley and watching the protests from the roof of Granma Books when he was shot by police. ==References== Category:1960s in California Category:1960s protests People's Park protest Category:Berkeley, California Category:Ronald Reagan",
