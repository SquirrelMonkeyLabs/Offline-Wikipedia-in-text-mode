 "text": "The Transnistrian ruble is the currency used in the breakaway state of Transnistria. Since Transnistria is a polity with no credible international recognition and its territory is formally part of Moldova, its currency has no ISO 4217 code, and thus Transnistria cannot participate in any global card payment processing network. Cards are accepted, but only on the Russian developed MIR network. However, unofficially some Transnistrian organisations, such as Agroprombank and Gazprombank, used the code PRB, a code reserved for Puerto Rico (ISO 3166-1 country code \"PR\"). The Transnistrian Republican Bank sometimes uses the code RUP, a code reserved for Russia (ISO 3166-1 country code \"RU\"). ==Exchange rates== The currency is de facto pegged to the United States dollar. The central bank determines each workday whether it is appropriate to devalue the currency against the US dollar.[citation needed] As of 12 October 2024 (Transnistrian ruble per foreign currency unit) * US dollar: 16.1000 rubles * Euro: 17.6150 rubles * Russian ruble: 0.1676 rubles * Ukrainian hryvnia: 0.3907 rubles * Moldovan leu: 0.8821 rubles * Romanian leu: 3.5 rubles On 11 February 2009, the exchange rate was set to 9 Transnistrian rubles per dollar. It was changed to 9.40 rubles on 5 March 2010, 9.80 on 24 September 2010, and 10.20 on 14 December 2010. By 2013, the value of the ruble had dropped to 11.10 rubles per dollar. This was further changed to 11.30 per dollar on 16 March 2016. On 17 June 2017, the currency was devalued to 15 rubles per dollar. It was set to 16 per dollar on 12 January 2018. The most recent change was made on 5 April 2018, when it was set to 16.10 rubles per dollar.
