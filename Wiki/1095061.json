 "text": "The BC United (BCU) is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. It is a conservative, neoliberal party and is considered to be centre- right. Kevin Falcon has been the leader of the party since 2022. The party was started as the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1903 with the first leader being James Alexander MacDonald. On April 12, 2023, the party officially changed its name to BC United. This came after the party had seen a large amount of people not want to vote for them and them being taken over by the BC Conservatives as the second most popular party in BC. They also won a majority government eight times, in 1916, 1920, 1933, 1937, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2013. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1903 establishments Category:1900s establishments in Canada Category:British Columbia Category:Organizations based in Vancouver Category:Political parties in Canada",
