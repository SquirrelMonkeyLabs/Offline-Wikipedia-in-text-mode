 "text": "The sooty barbthroat (Threnetes niger) is a species of hummingbird. It is found in French Guiana and far north-eastern Brazil. Its habitat is humid tropical lowland forest. Though normally restricted in range, it is common enough to be thought a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion. Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a \"melanistic variant\" of the pale- tailed barbthroat (T. leucurus). Not only that, but some suggest that the bronze-tailed barbthroat (T. n. loehkeni) should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina's barbthroat (T. n. christinae) as a subspecies. Freire's Sooty barbthroat (T. n. freirei) is average between the sooty and bronze-tailed barbthroats however, and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed. == References == * Category:Birds of South America Category:Hummingbirds",
