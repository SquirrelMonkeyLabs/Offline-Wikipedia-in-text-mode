 "text": "Cornelia Clapp (born March 17, 1849) was a teacher and scientist in the 1800s. Clapp taught Mathematics and natural history. Reynolds, M. D. (2004). American Women Scientists: 23 Inspiring Biographies, 1900-2000. United Kingdom: McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers. p.5-8. Clapp was the first woman in the United States to receive a doctorate in biology. In 1888, Syracuse University conferred on her a Ph.B. degree, and a year later, a Ph.D. In the 1880’s she was considered an innovator in her day. Clapp improved science by teaching directly from observation, not the textbooks. During Clapp’s career, she taught mathematics and natural history, which is also known as zoology. By 1883, she was recognized as one of the greatest zoologists in the country and was awarded the title of “Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,” an honor typically given to outstanding women. Clapp enhanced the field of science education by teaching directly from observation rather than relying exclusively on textbooks. In 1888, Syracuse University awarded her a Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B.), and she earned her Ph.D. a year later. In late 1899, Clapp introduced an embryology class at Mount Holyoke, which is a branch of biology and medicine concerned with the study of embryos and their development. Clapp was the first woman to obtain a doctorate in biology, achieving this milestone in 1896. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2025",
