 "text": "The French alphabet uses the same letters as the ISO basic Latin alphabet as well as the English alphabet, although its pronunciation is different from that of English. Some letters sometimes also have diacritics on them (e.g. Fran√ßais), but letters with diacritics are considered to be a modified form of the letters without diacritics, so they are not different letters of the alphabet. The letters \"k\" and \"w\" do not appear in original French words, only in words borrowed from other languages (e.g. kangourou, wagon). Category:French language Category:Alphabets",
