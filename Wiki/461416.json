From the second part of 1921 to 1922, Azerbaijan SSR used a red flag with the yellow Cyrillic letters АССР (ASSR). In 1937, golden hammer and sickle were added in the top left hand corner, with beneath the Latin letters AzSSR in a serif font in place of the Cyrillic letters. A third version was issued in 1940s, and had AzSSR replaced by its Cyrillic version АзССР. The last version of the flag was adopted by the Azerbaijan SSR on October 7, 1952. It was the flag of the Soviet Union, with an horizontal blue band on the bottom fourth. == Timeline of the flag of the Azerbaijan SSR == File:Flag of Azerbaijan 1920.gif|Flag in 1920 File:Flag of Azerbaijan SSR (1920-1921).svg|Flag in 1920-1921 File:Flag of Azerbaijan SSR (1921-1922).svg|Flag in 1921-1922 File:Flag of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (1921–1922).svg|Flag in 1922 File:Flag of Azerbaijan 1922 (2).svg|Flag in 1922-1924 File:Flag of Azerbaijan 1924.svg|Flag in 1924 File:Flag of Azerbaijan 1924 (1).svg|Flag in 1924-1925 File:Flag of Azerbaijan 1929.svg|Flag in 1929 File:Flag AzSSR.svg|Flag in 1937-1940 File:Flag АзССР.svg|Flag in 1940-1952 ==Related pages== *Flag of the Soviet Union *Flag of Azerbaijan *Coat of Arms of Azerbaijan *Azerbaijan == References == Category:Flags of Azerbaijan Azerbaijan SSR Category:Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic Category:Historical flags",
