It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. == History == The library was built in 1916 during immigration to Minneapolis. It was one block away from Central High School before it was destroyed. The building is in the Collegiate Gothic style. == Roy Woodstrom == Roy Woodstrom was the head librarian and was well liked by the community. In 2004, Budget cuts happened to the library, making the library open only four days a week. Woodstock raised $4000 to help keep the library open for 5 days a week. Woodstorm added multiple programs to the library, including the Hosmer World Music Series as weekly live music, World Film Series, Hosmer Library Friends Group for local funding, Hosmer Talent Show, as a talent show.Mintz, Katie, \"Library Heats up for Hosmer World Music Concert Series,\" January 2012, Lyndale Neighborhood News, http://www.lyndale.org/sites/default/files/LNN_January_2012_forweb_0.pdf \"Hosmer Library Forming Friends Group,\" November 2011, https://lyndale.org/sites/default/files/LNNNovember2011forweb.pdf p. 5.Hinds, Mark, \"Join Us to Say Thank You to Community Librarian Roy Woodstrom with Music in the Park,\" Lyndale Neighborhood News, September 2014, http://www.lyndale.org/sites/default/files/Files/LNNSeptember2014-web.pdf p. 12. == Updating Hosmer Library == In 1951, an enclosure was added to the east side stairway for $900.
