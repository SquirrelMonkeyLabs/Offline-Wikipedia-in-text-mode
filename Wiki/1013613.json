 "text": "The Thai bug-eyed frog, black-brown warted frog, Malayan warted tree frog, horrible bug-eyed frog, or spiny wart frog (Theloderma horridus) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Borneo. Scientists say it might also live in Sumatra. This frog lives in rainforests that are not too high above sea level. People have seen this frog between 100 and 800 meters above sea level. It only lives in forests that have never been cut down. People have seen them in the dead leaves on the ground and sitting on tree trunks. The female frog lays eggs in holes in trees that have water in them. She lays them on the inside of the tree above the water. After the eggs hatch, the tadpoles swim in the water. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger. Human beings cut down trees to get wood to build with. This frog lives in protected parks: Danum Conservation Area, Bukit Timah, Templer's Park Recreational Forest, Tanjung Biwah. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
