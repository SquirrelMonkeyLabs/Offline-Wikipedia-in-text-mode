 "text": "Karnataka bubble-nest frog, Seshachar's bush frog, or Chari's bush frog (Raorchestes charius) is a frog. It lives in southwestern India, Bhutan in the Southern Ghat Mountains. People have seen it between 800 and 1400 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen and broadleaf forests and in grasslands, but people have also seen a few on large farms. The frog sits on plants about 1 m off the ground. The frog hatches from its egg as a small frog. People have seen the adults and young frogs in leaf litter on the ground. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Many of the places the frog lives are protected parks. This frog is in some danger from fires and from people changing its forest into farmland, building roads, and from visitors. Scientists believe the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
