 "text": "Fredie Blom (8 May 1904 - 22 August 2020) was a South African supercentenarian and a longevity claimant. Blom had not been officially recognized by the Guinness World Records or the Gerontology Research Group. However he was named by the South African media as the oldest man in the world. He spent most of his life working as a labourer in the construction sector and on a farm during the apartheid period. He initially worked as a farm worker in Cape Town before joining the construction sector. He was illiterate. During an interview with the BBC in 2018, he revealed that there was no secret behind his longevity. He revealed that he loved smoking. He was issued a South African government identity document showing his date of birth as May 8, 1904, but the Guinness World Records never officially verified his age. Blom died on 22 August 2020 at the alleged age of 116 and 106 days. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Supercentenarians Category:People from Cape Town",
