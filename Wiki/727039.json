 "text": "Obazoa is a clade (a group of plants or animals that share an ancestor). It is a Unikont. Unikonts are one of the five superkingdoms in the classification of eukaryotes. The Obazoa is made up of Breviatea, Apusomonadida and Opisthokonta. It does not include Amoebozoa, because that is a different clade. The connections between opisthokonts, breviates and apusomonads are not well known yet. Probably the Breviatea are the most basic of the three groups. RNA phylogenies (evolution clues) do not give much evidence that Obazoa is a clade. This could still mean Obazoa is from a very old ancestor, and there are not many clues left (because of its age). == References == Category:Eukaryotes",
