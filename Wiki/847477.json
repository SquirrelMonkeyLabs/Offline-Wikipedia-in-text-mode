 "text": "Ózd () is a city in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, Northern Hungary, from the county seat of Miskolc. Ózd is the second largest city in the county. == Location == It is located in the industrial region of northern Hungary, 60 kilometers northwest of Miskolc. === Connection === The main way to get to Ózd is Road 25, which goes through the city from southwest to northeast. A few smaller side roads come off it and link the city areas and nearby villages farther from the center. == History == People have lived in the area since ancient times. The first real written mention of the settlement is from 1272. At the start of the 20th century Ózd was a village. In 1940, Ózd merged with the villages of Bolyok and Sajóvárkony, and in 1949 it became a town. In the late 1950s, there was a plan to add more villages (Center, Uraj, Susa, Szentsimon) to the city, but local leaders delayed it until the late 1970s, citing a lack of development funds and resources for the growing population. In 1999, part of the town, Farkaslyuk, became its own municipality. == Population == During the 2022 census, 85.8% of the population identified as Hungarian, 9.5% as Roma, 0.4% as German, 0.1-0.1% as Bulgarian, Slovak, and Romanian, 1.6% as other non-native nationalities (14.1% did not respond; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%). According to their religion, 24.6% were Roman Catholic, 5.7% Reformed, 2.3% Greek Catholic, 1.7% other Christian, 0.5% Lutheran, 18.5% non-denominational (45.9% did not respond). ==Notes==",
