He and childhood friend Mike Dirnt started Sweet Children, their first band which eventually developed into Green Day in 1987. They added drummer John Kiffenmeyer (Al Sobrante). Sobrante left the band to go to college as they were making waves and gaining popularity. Frank Edwin Wright III (famously known as Tre Cool) replaced him as the permanent drummer making the official line up of Green Day in 1989. The band gained a following in the punk scene in California, particularly in the Gilman Street Scene. They released three EPs (1000 hours, 39/Smooth and Slappy) before releasing two LPs, one being a compilation of the EPs (1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hour) in 1991 and Kerplunk later in the same year. With the release of their first major label album Dookie the band gained worldwide attention. Their intentions were not to sell out but just to make music. Unfortunately the popularity did not do well with the Gilman scene and they were exiled. However, despite those rough years the band became increasingly popular. ==Personal life== Armstrong is openly bisexual.Idiot savant He is married and lives in Berkeley, California with his wife Adrienne Armstrong and two sons Jakob and Joseph. Armstrong has considered himself to be Independent with left-wing causes, and endorsed Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden.
