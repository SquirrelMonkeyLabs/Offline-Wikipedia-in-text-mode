 "text": "Yaoi (Japanese: やおい) is a term for fiction that shows homosexual male relationships. Female fans are called \"fujoshi\" (Japanese: 腐女子, literally \"rotten girl\") and male fans are called \"fudanshi\" (Japanese: 腐男子, literally \"rotten boy\"). Some yaoi are based off of real events but most are from the artist's imagination. One example of yaoi anime is Sekaiichi hatsukoi, a good example of a great yaoi manga is \"Obnoxious Hero-kun\". There are also works of fiction that show lesbian relationships. This is called \"yuri\". Yaoi is created by both men and women while yuri is mostly created by men.
