They were called Separatists. This religion was not allowed in England. He and his family left England and joined a religious group in Leiden, Holland.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers, (Indiana:Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 116 The Chiltons were not welcome by some people in Leiden. This may have been because of their religion. James and his daughter were attacked by several boys who threw rocks at them. When Chilton tried to speak to the crowd, he was struck in the head by a large cobblestone, and was knocked unconscious.Jeremy D. Bangs, ed.
