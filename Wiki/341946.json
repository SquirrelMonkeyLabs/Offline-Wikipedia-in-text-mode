In the words of Michel Wachenheim:Jacques Villiers sur le site des amis du CENA \"We can consider Jacques Villiers as one of the main founders of \"the French school of air navigation\" with everything it has scientific expertise, know-how technological and operational experience. He quickly understood that France could and should play a leading role in this sector, because of its aviation history, its ability to train highly qualified specialists, but also its global ambitions and European geography. He retained confident until the end that we could provide leadership in technical international level, I am reminded of conversations with him on this subject. The best tribute to him is certainly to continue in this way.\" == Bibliography == * In partnership with Paul Funel, Le transport aérien français : rapport au ministre d'État, ministre des Transports, La documentation française, Paris 1982 () * Académie nationale de l'air et de l'espace and Lucien Robineau, Les français du ciel, dictionnaire historique, Le Cherche-Midi, June 2005, 782 p.
