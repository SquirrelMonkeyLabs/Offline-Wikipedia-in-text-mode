 "text": "Lithium oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li2O. It contains lithium and oxide ions. ==Properties== Lithium oxide is a white solid. It is a strong base. It is corrosive when dissolved in water. Lithium oxide dissolves in water to make lithium hydroxide. It reacts with acids to make lithium salts. It reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate is much less corrosive. It makes a red color in a flame. ==Preparation== When lithium is burned to air, it forms lithium oxide. This reaction also makes lithium nitride. It can also be made by heating lithium peroxide. ==Uses== It is used as a flux in glazing ceramics. It can be used in scientific research. It could also be used in lithium ion batteries. ==Safety== Lithium oxide is very corrosive. It reacts with water to make lithium hydroxide. It is toxic because of its strong alkalinity (being a base). ==Related pages== *Lithium nitrate *Lithium chloride Category:Lithium compounds Category:Oxides",
