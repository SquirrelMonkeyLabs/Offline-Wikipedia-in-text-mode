 "text": "A headland is an area of land that is surrounded by water on three sides. Very often, the land areas are called capes. A bay is an area of water. It is surrounded by land on three sides. The water areas are also called gulfs.Whittow, John (1984). Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984, pp. 80, 246. . Headlands are formed when there are parallel sections of softer and harder rock perpendicular to the coast. The sea erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock, forming a bay. The harder rock that is left protruding into the sea is the headland. ==References== Category:Landforms",
