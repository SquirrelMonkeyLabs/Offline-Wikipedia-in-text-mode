Pallabi Sharma plays the role of protagonist Joba having garnered tremendous viewer appraisal. Bishwajit Ghosh plays Param, the other half of a well-loved screen-couple. The show comes from Boyhood Productions, one of the leading production houses in Kolkata. == Plot== Ke Apon Ke Por focuses on the journey of a girl that started out as a domestic help and went on to establish herself as someone who’s well suited to be the daughter-in-law of the household and a Lawyer by profession. Alternatively, what forms the core of the show is also reflected in the beautiful love story between Joba and the son of the very affluent family, Param. This story also brings to light the trials of a joint family where sons and daughters try to break away. Joba however, still tries to hold the family together. As parents try to build a family with a lot of love and care, sons and daughters grow up to be selfish and remain concerned only about parents’ money and property. As parents fear divisive tendencies in the family, circumstances get Param and Joba to tie the knot. Siblings rot over possibilities of paternal property going entirely to Joba and Param and eventually seize riches and drive the parents out. Param and Joba toil endlessly to hold pieces of the family together. In the recent past, the story has taken a successful leap as Joba and Param face the bitter-sweet realities of being parents to kids that continue to grow up and grow apart. The show is also simultaneously establishing the position of Itu who happens to resemble Joba in more ways than one. Fate intervenes and Itu gets married to Sarthak, Joba and Param’s Son. ==Cast== * Pallavi Sharma as Joba * Biswajit Ghosh as Param * Indranil Chattejee as Sarthak * Titli Aich as Itu * Simran Upadhyay as Koyel ===Crew=== * Director - Siddhartha Pal * Producer - Nispal Singh & Susanta Das * Screenplay - Sayantani Bhattacharya * Dialogue - Saurav Sengupta * Camera - Ashok Pramanik * Editing - Amitabha Bagchi * Music Director - Debjit == Adaptations == Language Title Original release Network(s) Last aired Notes Bengali Ke Apon Ke Por কে আপন কে পর 25 July 2016 Star Jalsha 27 December 2020 Original Tamil Raja Rani ராஜா ராணி 29 May 2017 Star Vijay 13 July 2019 Remake Telugu Kathalo Rajakumari కథలో రాజకుమారి 29 January 2018 Star Maa 24 January 2020 Kannada Putmalli ಪುತ್ಮಲ್ಲಿ 11 December 2017 Star Suvarna 22 June 2018 Marathi Sukh Mhanje Nakki Kay Asta! सुख म्हणजे नक्की काय असतं! 17 August 2020 Star Pravah Ongoing Malayalam Padatha Painkili പാടാത്ത പൈങ്കിളി 7 September 2020 Asianet Hindi Saath Nibhaana Saathiya 2 साथ निभाना साथिया २ 19 October 2020 StarPlus Kannada Raji ರಾಜಿ Star Suvarna Category:2010s Indian television series Category:2016 Indian television series debuts",
