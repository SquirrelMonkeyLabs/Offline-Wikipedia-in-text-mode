 "text": "Welsh independence (Welsh: Annibyniaeth i Gymru) is a political movement that wants Wales to leave the United Kingdom and be an independent country. Wales was conquered by Edward I of England in the 13th century and became part of the Kingdom of England in 1535. The idea of an independent Welsh state began in the middle of the 1800s and has gotten more recognition in the 21st century. There are political parties like Plaid Cymru and Propel that support the idea. There has also been a few paramilitary groups, such as the Free Wales Army and Meibion Glynd≈µr that wanted independence. In 2019, three independence marches took place. The first one happened in Cardiff, Wales' capital city, and around 3,000 people took part. The second march happened in Caernarfon in Gwynedd and around 8,000 people took part. A third march happened in Merthyr Tydfil with 5,200 people taking part. In a 2021 poll by ITV News, 39% of Welsh people said they wanted independence. The growth of independence movements in Wales and Scotland has resulted in English independence movements also becoming bigger. ==Related pages== * Devolution * Scottish independence Category:Nationalism Category:Politics of Wales Category:Organisations based in Wales",
