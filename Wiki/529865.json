Most European, many Latin American, a few African and a few Asian countries have legal requirements for paid sick leave. ==History== Already in 1500 BC, at least some of the workers who built the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs received paid sick leave as well as state-sponsored healthcare. ==Sick pay== Sick pay is money paid to a person who is not able to work because they are ill. This may come from the business they normally work for, from health insurance, or from social security. To get the money most people will need a sick note from a medical doctor to show that they cannot work. ==Examples== In the United Kingdom (UK), general practitioners had to give people sick notes since the National Insurance Act 1911. They could get 10 shillings a week Sickness benefit for 26 weeks. ==References== Category:Society Category:Civil rights Category:Human rights Category:Employment law Category:Social security",
