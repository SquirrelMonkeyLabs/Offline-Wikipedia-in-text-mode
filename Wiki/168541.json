 "text": "Shrove Tuesday is a holiday in which Christians have ash put on their heads in the shape of a cross in the United Kingdom, Canada, The United States and Australia for the day before Ash Wednesday. Ash Wednesday is the first day of the Christian season of prayer and fasting called Lent. On Shrove Tuesday people traditionally cook and eat pancakes in Britain. The reason for this was to use up foods such as fat, eggs and milk before Lent. It is also called Pancake Tuesday or Pancake Day in Britain. In some other countries, such as the United States, it is called Mardi Gras. In some cultures it has close ties with Mischief night. Category:Festivals",
