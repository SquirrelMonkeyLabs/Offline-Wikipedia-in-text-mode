 "text": "The \"Himno Nacional de Costa Rica\" is the national anthem of Costa Rica. ==Lyrics== Spanish original English translation Noble fatherland! Your beautiful flag gives us expression of your life; under the limpid blue of your sky, white and pure, rests peace. In the tenacious struggle, of fruitful labour, that makes the face of man red; your children, simple peasants, conquered 𝄆 eternal prestige, esteem and honour. 𝄇 Hail, oh gentle land! Hail, oh mother of love! When someone intends to stain your glory, you will see in your people, brave and virile, the rustic tool turn into a weapon. Hail, oh fatherland! Your prodigal soil gives us sweet shelter and sustenance; under the limpid blue of your sky, may work and peace always live! ==References== Costa Category:National symbols of Costa Rica",
