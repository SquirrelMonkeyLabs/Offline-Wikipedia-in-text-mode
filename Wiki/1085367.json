The Alma mater Lipsiensis started in 1409, officially approved by Pope Alexander V in his Bull of Acknowledgment on September 9 of that year. Its first leader was Johannes Otto von Münsterberg. The Paulinerkirche, Leipzig's church, served as the university church from the beginning. After the Reformation, the church and monastery buildings were given to the university in 1544.

Like many European universities, the University of Leipzig had different colleges responsible for housing and teaching. These included the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (also known as the New College), the College of Our Lady, and the Pauliner College. There were also private living spaces called \"bursaries.\" The colleges had authority over their members, but this structure was later abandoned, and only the names remain today.
