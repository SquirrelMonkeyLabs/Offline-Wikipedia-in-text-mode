 "text": "Protect and Survive was a British public information campaign on civil defence. The booklet was published in May 1980. It told people what they should do if there was a nuclear war. It was turned into a series of twenty short public information films for television. They were secret but they were leaked to CND and the BBC, who broadcast parts of them on Panorama. They were later described as \"the calm, clipped vowels of a male announcer, advising how to build shelters, avoid fallout, and wrap up your dead loved ones in polythene, bury them, and tag their bodies.\" People were told they should make a shelter inside their home by blocking off windows and fortifying the outside walls with furniture or bags of earth and sand; create an inner refuge, for example between two doors leaning together in an A-frame, surrounded by more furniture, books and bags of earth. E.P. Thompson published an anti-nuclear pamphlet called Protest and Survive. ==References== Category:1980 works Category:Books about nuclear issues Category:1980s in the United Kingdom Category:Pamphlets",
