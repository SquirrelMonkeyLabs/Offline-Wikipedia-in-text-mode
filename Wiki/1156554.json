 "text": "Rwandan genocide denial refers to someone thinking that the Rwandan genocide did not happen or was not as bad as it was. * * * * * Around the world, figures from across the political spectrum have engaged in Rwandan genocide denial. During the Rwandan genocide, around 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis, were murdered within 100 days. * * * * * * * * * * The murderers were Hutu nationalists. ==Timeline== Two notable deniers were David Peterson and American economist Edward S. Herman (1925–2017). In two of their books, they accused the Western media of \"selling\" the Rwandan genocide as a genocide in order to promote the \"economic and intellectual agendas of the U.S.\" However, what is the fact is that Western media did not pay much attention to the Rwandan genocide. Edward S. Herman published several books arguing that the Rwandan genocide should not be called a genocide. He also questioned the confirmed death toll of the Cambodian genocide * * * and Bosnian genocide, * * * * * * * * * * which drew criticism. ===2020s=== In December 2024, French-Cameroonian writer Charles Onana was convicted of downplaying the Rwandan genocide. * * * He was ordered to pay €8,400, while his publisher had to pay €5,000, because French laws ban the denial of any genocide recognized by the French government. ==Related pages== * Holocaust denial * Holodomor denial * Bosnian genocide denial * Armenian genocide denial * Cambodian genocide denial ==References== Category:Racism Category:Disinformation Category:Genocide denial Category:Conspiracy theories",
