 "text": "A bootloop (also named boot loop or boot-loop) is a problem that happens on computing devices which are unable to complete the regular booting sequence and reboot before it ends. The term \"bootloop\" is a more common way of saying \"reboot loop\". A bootloop occurs when a device repeatedly restarts without successfully loading the operating system. It can make the device feel caught in a loop, hence the name. Instead of proceeding to the home screen, the device continually goes through the boot-up process, making it practically unusable. A boot loop develops when improper communication is inside the operating system, preventing thedevice from completing its startup process. As a result, the device becomes trapped in a boot loop and keeps restarting. == Causes == Bootloop can be caused by a variety of things, from downloading new apps to accidentally changing system files. Water damage can corrode internal components, leading to a bootloop. Battery problems, such as low charge or malfunctions, can lead to bootloops by causing unstable power supply or corrupting system files during sudden power losses. Malicious software can interfere with the system's processes and cause a bootloop as it attempts to disrupt the device's normal operations. Installing a custom OS, rooting a phone, boot looping after a factory reset, rebooting to boot loader often causes it. ==References== Category:Computing",
