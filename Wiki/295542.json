 "text": "Roger Starr (1918 - 2001) was an intelligence officer during World War II, businessman, active in community organizations, and New York City housing administrator. Later in life, he became a writer for the New York Times. One of his books was called \"The Living End\". ==Planned shrinkage== He proposed a \"planned shrinkage\" in 1976. He wanted people to leave the depressed areas like the South Bronx. The mayor he served as the Housing and Development administrator did not support the idea. Members of the City Council called it \"inhuman\", \"racist\" and \"genocidal\". Protesters would make disturbances on his public appearances. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Writers from New York City Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:American people of World War II",
