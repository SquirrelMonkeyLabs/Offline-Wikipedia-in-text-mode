 "text": "A spaceport is a place for spacecrafts to launch or land. It may have launch pads for rocket, and many buildings for preparing and launching space flights. Spaceports launch man-made satellites for scientific and other purposes. There are about forty spaceports around the world, but a few big ones do most of the launches. Most are owned by government agencies, for example NASA. Science fiction stories set in the future often have spaceports that are like modern airports. In these stories, many spacecraft may come and go every day, transporting passengers like a real-life airline. == Related pages == * Baikonur Cosmodrome * Cape Canaveral Air Force Station * Kennedy Space Center Category:Spaceports",
