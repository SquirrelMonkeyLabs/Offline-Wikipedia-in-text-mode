 "text": "The Real Irish Republican Army (or Real IRA) is a group from Ireland who want Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland, and want it to leave the United Kingdom. The group started after they left the Provisional Irish Republican Army, after an argument. On 15 August 1998 they did the Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people and hurt over 300 people. They have shot police officers and have also bombed places in England, such as London and Birmingham. It is against the law to be a member of the Real IRA. == References == Category:Irish nationalist organisations Category:National liberation movements Category:Irish Republican Army Category:1997 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in Northern Ireland",
