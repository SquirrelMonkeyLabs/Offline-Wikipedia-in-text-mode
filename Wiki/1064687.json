 "text": "Polypedates is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, subfamily Rhacophorinae. People call them whipping frogs in English. They live in eastern and southern Asia. Scientists have disagreed about whether these frogs should be called Polypedates or Rhacophorus. molecular phylogenetic studies show that they are two different groups of frogs and not the same group. Polypedates and Taruga are considered to be the sister taxon of Feihyla and Rhacophorus. ==Species== These species are in the genus Polypedates, and scientists find more often: * Polypedates assamensis Mathew & Sen, 2009 * Polypedates bengalensis Purkayastha et al., 2019 * Polypedates braueri (Vogt, 1911) – White-lipped treefrog or Java treefrog * Polypedates colletti (Boulenger, 1890) – Collett's whipping frog, black-spotted tree frog, or Collett's tree frog * Polypedates cruciger Blyth, 1852 – Sri Lanka whipping frog or common hour-glass tree-frog * Polypedates discantus Rujirawan, Stuart, and Aowphol, 2013 – Malayan slender treefrog * Polypedates hecticus Peters, 1863 – Samara flying frog * Polypedates himalayensis (Annandale, 1912) – Himalayan tree frog * Polypedates impresus Yang, 2008 * Polypedates insularis Das, 2005 – Nicobarese tree frog * Polypedates iskandari Riyanto, Mumpuni & McGuire, 2011 * Polypedates leucomystax (Gravenhorst, 1829) – common tree frog, four-lined tree frog, striped tree frog, \"white-lipped tree frog\" (formerly often in P. maculatus) * Polypedates macrotis (Boulenger, 1891) – Bongao tree frog * Polypedates maculatus (Gray, 1830) – common Indian tree frog, Chunam tree frog * Polypedates megacephalus Hallowell, 1861 – spot- legged tree frog, Hong Kong whipping frog, \"brown tree frog\" * Polypedates mutus (Smith, 1940) – northern treefrog * Polypedates occidentalis Das and Dutta, 2006 – western tree frog * Polypedates otilophus (Boulenger, 1893) – file-eared tree frog, Borneo eared frog * Polypedates pseudocruciger Das and Ravichandran, 1998 – false hour-glass tree frog or yellow tree frog * Polypedates pseudotilophus Matsui, Hamidy, and Kuraishi, 2014 * Polypedates ranwellai Wickramasingha, Munindradasa, and Fernando, 2012 – Ranwella's spined tree frog * Polypedates subansiriensis Mathew & Sen, 2009 – Subansiri's tree frog * Polypedates taeniatus (Boulenger, 1906) – Bengal whipping Frog, Bengal whipping tree frog, or Terai tree frog * Polypedates teraiensis (Dubois, 1987) – common tree frog, six-lined tree frog, Terai tree frog, or Perching frog * Polypedates zed (Dubois, 1987) – Nepalese tree frog or Narayanghat whipping frog The recently described Polypedates bijuiZachariah, Dinesh, Kunhikrishnan, Das, Raju, Radhakrishnan, Palot & Kalesh, 2011 has now been renamed as Beddomixalus bijui, the only species in its genus. ==Phylogeny== Pyron & Wiens (2011) say that the frogs are related to each other this way. 8 species are included. Polypedates is a sister group of Feihyla. Together, Polypedates and Feihyla form a sister group to Rhacophorus. Another group of scientists, Kuraishi, et al. (2013), say the frogs are related to each other this way.KURAISHI, N., MATSUI, M., HAMIDY, A., BELABUT, D. M., AHMAD, N., PANHA, S., SUDIN, A., YONG, H. S., JIANG, J.-P., OTA, H., THONG, H.

Zoologica Scripta, 42: 54–70. doi:10.1111/j.1463-6409.2012.00562.x Polypedates and Rhacophorus are estimated to have split off from their most recent common ancestor 26.6 million years ago during the Oligocene. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Frogs of Asia",
