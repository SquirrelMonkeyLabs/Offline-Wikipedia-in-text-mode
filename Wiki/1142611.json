 "text": "Claudia De la Cruz, a leftist activist from New York, announced her campaign for president of the United States in the 2024 presidential election on September 7, 2023. She and running mate Karina Garcia are the presidential ticket for the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), a Marxistâ€“Leninist party. The campaign promises to support reparations for Black Americans, push for a single-payer healthcare system, end all U.S aid to Israel, forgive all student loan debt, fully recognize Native American sovereignty and honor treaty rights, cut the U.S. military budget by 90%, nationalize the 100 largest US corporations, expand access to public transportation, and use taxation to end billionaires. For the 2024 election, Democrats have been working to keep De la Cruz along with other third-party candidates such as Cornel West off of ballots, while Republicans have tried to keep De la Cruz and West on ballots to take votes away from Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign. In June 2024, De la Cruz gave a speech at a pro-Palestine protest that was near the White House. ==References== De la Cruz, Claudia",
