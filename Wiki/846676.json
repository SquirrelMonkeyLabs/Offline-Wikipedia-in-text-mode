 "text": "A Pop-It (also known as Go Pop and Last One Lost) is a fidget toy. It is made of a brightly colored silicone tray with bubbles that can be popped. These bubbles are similar to bubble wrap but they can be flipped and re-used. The toys come in many different colors, shapes and sizes. Some of them can even be worn. The toy is marketed as a stress-reliever. It became popular the spring of 2021 because of TikTok influencers. Its popularity was also affected by boredom and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. == References == Category:Toys",
