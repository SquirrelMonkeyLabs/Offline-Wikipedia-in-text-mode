 "text": "An acting president of Argentina is a person who lawfully exercises the powers and duties of the President of Argentina despite not holding the office in their own right. There is an established presidential line of succession in which officials of the federal government may be called upon to be acting president if the incumbent president becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns, or is removed from office by impeachment. The last person to serve as Acting President of Argentina was Victoria Villarruel on January 16, 2024, on the occasion of President Javier Milei's trip to participate in the Davos Forum. ==Overview== The vice president immediately assumes the presidency in the event of the death, resignation, or removal of the president from office. Similarly, if a president-elect were to die during the transition period or decline to serve, the vice president-elect would become president on Inauguration Day. A vice president may also serve as acting president if the president becomes incapacitated. If both the presidency and vice presidency were to become vacant, the statutory successor would act as president but would not formally assume the office. ==References== Category:Presidents of Argentina",
