 "text": "Wiglaf is a character in the epic poem Beowulf. He is the orphaned son of a warrior king who enters the service of Beowulf, who is now the king of the Geats. He assists the warrior king in his battle against a dragon which has attacked his kingdom. Beowulf is incapacitated, but Wiglaf comes to help him and eventually the dragon dies after it is stabbed (cut with a blade) in the throat. The old king is severely injured and asks to see the dragon's treasure. With his dying words, he crowns Wiglaf as his successor (as he does not have any biological children and all of his forebears have died). Beowulf is then burned in a Norse funeral and Wiglaf rules the kingdom. Category:Germanic mythology",
