 "text": "Gameplay is the way players interact with a game, and in particular with video games. It is the connection between the game rules, challenges and overcoming them and the plot. Video game gameplay is how attracting the graphics and audio are to the player. ==Overview== Along with the rise of video game development in the 1980s, the term gameplay was used only in the context of video games. Now its popularity has started to be used in the description of other, more traditional, game types. Generally, gameplay is about the general experience of playing a video game. It does not include other things like graphics and sound. Game mechanics, on the other hand, is the set of rules in a game that are supposed to make an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions often use terms like \"game mechanics\". This is because \"gameplay\" is too general for academic discussions. == Gameplay types == * Cooperative gameplay * Deathmatch * Emergent gameplay * Hack and slash * Leveled gameplay * Micromanagement * Nonlinear gameplay * Passive gameplay * Twitch gameplay == References == == Books == * Desurvire, H., Caplan, M., & Toth, J.
