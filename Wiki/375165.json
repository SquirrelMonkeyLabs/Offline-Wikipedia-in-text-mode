 "text": "Theophrastus (; c. 371 â€“ c. 287 BC), a Greek native of Eresos in Lesbos, was the successor to Aristotle in the Peripatetic school. He came to Athens at a young age and studied in Plato's school. After Plato's death, he attached himself to Aristotle. Aristotle left his writings to Theophrastus, and named Theophrastus the new leader of the Lyceum. Theophrastus led the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school was very successful. He is often considered the \"father of botany\" for his works on plants. After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was Strato of Lampsacus.
