Some historians believe he was the founder of the Ninth Dynasty of Egypt. Others believe he was a pharaoh in the Tenth Dynasty of Egypt. Wakhare lived and was active around 2150 BCE. == Supposed writing career == Many scholars believe that Wahkare Khety was the writer of the book Teaching for King Merykare. It is known that whoever wrote that book, also wrote his name. The writer wrote his name as Khety. However, the theory that the name Khety referred to as Wahkare Khety is disputed. Other scholars believed that Meryibre Khety, another Egyptian pharaoh, wrote the book, and not Wahkare. Category:3rd-millennium BC pharaohs",
