 "text": "Moraines are accumulations of debris that are found in regions where there are glaciers or were glaciers formerly. Moraines which are found far off from existing glaciers were created during a past ice age. The debris may have been taken off the valley floor as a glacier moved or fallen off the valley walls as a result of weathering. Moraines may be made of silt like glacial flour to large boulders. Moraines may be on the glacierâ€™s surface or deposited as piles or sheets of debris where the glacier has melted. Moraines may also develop when a glacier or iceberg reaches the sea and melts, dropping rocks that it has carried. ==Related pages== * Landform * Long Island ==References== *Easterbrook, D. J.
