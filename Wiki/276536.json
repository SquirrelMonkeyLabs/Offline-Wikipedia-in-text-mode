Lee cannot use most of the ninja techniques but he wants to become a very good ninja. He is focused on using just taijutsu. Taijutsu is a ninja technique similar to martial arts. Lee has been in many pieces of Naruto media. He is in the third and fourth movies in the series, the third original animation and many video games.

Lee has been popular among the Naruto reader base. He was placed high in many polls done to see which character is more popular. Different types of merchandise like figurines and plush dolls have been created based on Lee. == Creation and concept == In an interview in Weekly Shōnen Jumps Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37, Masashi Kishimoto said that he enjoys drawing Lee more than any other character in the series. While coming up with Lee's looks, Kishimoto planned to make Lee with different kinds of weapons, including nunchaku. Due to lack of time while creating the series, he couldn't do it. Kishimoto's first editor, Kosuke Yahagi, drew the author a draft of Lee at the start. Kishimoto later changed a lot from how it was drawn by his editor. Yahagi felt happy because some parts were kept. Kishimoto has noted that he originally created Lee as a symbol of human weakness. His design of Sakura Haruno was also meant to carry the same symbolism. Kishimoto was surprised by Lee's popularity within fans. He wanted to write more about him but the timing was never right. Lee became very popular within course of the series. Due to this Kishimoto tries to keep him forward in promotional artwork. Brian Donovan is the voice actor for Rock Lee in the English version of the anime. In an interview he commented that he had fun voicing Lee because he felt he was trying to be \"very proper\".

Right after the operation, Lee follows a team of ninja led by Shikamaru Nara who try to stop Sasuke Uchiha from leaving the village and going to the village of Otogakure.
