 "text": "Jean-François Lyotard was a French sociologist and philosopher. Lyotard criticized Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx because he said that their ideas were based on religion. Lyotard said Freud based his ideas on Judaism and that Marx based his ideas on Catholicism. Lyotard also criticized the Enlightenment since he didn’t believe in Universal Truth. Lyotard also wrote a book called The Postmodern Condition where he said that Postmodernism meant not believing in Metanarratives. He said that history was a story and ideas about history were stories about stories called Metanarratives. He also said that since words mean different things for different people at different times, you can never really know what is real. Lyotard also said that even science is just a story.
