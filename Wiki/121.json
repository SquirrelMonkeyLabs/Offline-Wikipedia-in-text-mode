The government that runs the country is called the state. Canada and other countries. == Number of countries == There is no universally accepted answer as to how many countries in the world there actually are, however the minimum answer is 195, though there are 193 United Nations members. This can be developed on even further by adding the constituent countries of the United Kingdom, The Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Denmark which could add anywhere from three to eleven more countries. There are multiple organisations that have their own lists of countries, one example being the Travellers Century Club which recognises 330 countries as of January 2022. == Disputed countries == Palestine is classified as a country.

Usually the administration of the territory is carried out by one of the countries that claims sovereignty, while the other country does not recognize the sovereignty over the territory of the other country. This does not usually happen in land or sea areas on which none possesses effective control, such as Antarctica, or only partially == Nation-state == A nation-state is a sovereign country in which the majority of citizens are somewhat homogeneous in terms of culture,religion,language, ethnicity, etc. . ==Related pages== *State *Sovereign state *Nation ==References== ==Other websites== * Geography Trainer 1.3.5 - Educational game aimed at school children to teach world capitals * Geography Trainer US States 1.1 game * List of countries * Geography Site Country Profiles - Based on the CIA World Factbook Category:Basic English 850 words",
