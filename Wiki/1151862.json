 "text": "Vaajakoski, located in the Jyväskylä region of Finland, has a rich industrial history spanning from the early 19th century to the late 20th century. The area transformed from a rural village into a hub of sawmill and later diversified industries. Its development was closely tied to its waterways, particularly the Vaajavirta channel, and industrial enterprises such as the Central Finnish Cooperative Society (SOK) and other factories. == Early development == 1800s: The first sawmills were established in Vaajakoski in the early 19th century, marking the beginning of its industrialization. Companies like T. & J. Salvesen played a significant role in its early economic growth. 1916: The Central Finnish Cooperative Society (SOK) purchased significant industrial properties, including sawmills, and expanded the area’s industrial activities. == Social and political changes == 1900s Politics: The early 20th century saw active labor movements, including the establishment of a socialist workers' association and a Christian workers' union. Vaajakoski was also influenced by national events like the Finnish Civil War, during which the local workforce and political affiliations were divided. == Industrial expansion == Factories: SOK developed a range of factories, including furniture, matchstick, and margarine production plants. By the 1970s, Vaajakoski was a major industrial area with over 10 factories employing about 2,000 workers. Decline: By the 1980s, financial difficulties led SOK to cease its industrial operations in the region. Many of the old factory buildings were repurposed for smaller industries and cultural activities. == Legacy and modern Vaajakoski == Today, Vaajakoski is known for its preserved industrial heritage and scenic environment along the Vaajavirta channel. Iconic landmarks include the old power plant and Naissaari, which is a historical and recreational site. Category:History of Finland",
