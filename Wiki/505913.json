 "text": "TAESA was a Mexican low-cost carrier. It began on April 27, 1988. It was one of the first low-cost airlines in Mexico. At times, it became Mexico's 3rd largest airline, after Aerom√©xico and Mexicana de Aviacion. On November 9, 1999, a TAESA plane crashed. It was flying from Uruapan to Mexico City International Airport. The crash killed 18 people. That crash and other factors led to TAESA declaring bankruptcy in February 2000. == Gallery == File:TAESA Boeing 767-300ER Volpati-1.jpg|A TAESA Boeing 767.
