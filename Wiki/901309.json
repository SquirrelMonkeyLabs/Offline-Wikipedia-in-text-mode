 "text": "Übersee is a municipality in Traunstein in upper Bavaria, Germany. It is on the south shore of lake Chiemsee. == Geography == === Geographic Place === Übersee is in the Chiemgau, more accurately at the northern entrance to the Achental (Achen Valley), the valley of the river Tiroler Achen which has its origin in Tyrol, Austria. Said river also marks most of the eastern border between Übersee and Grabenstätt, before flowing into lake Chiemsee. The area around the river mouth belongs to Übersee. The village is mostly on flat land, with the only major elevation being the Westerbuchberg, one of the southernmost parts of Übersee. The second stream flowing through the village is the Überseer Bach which has its origin in Grassau, south of Übersee. The smaller stream marks an east-bound border between Übersee, Bernau and the Chiemseemoos, while still flowing entirely within the area of Übersee. Through the neighbourhood of Feldwies, Übersee is connected to the shore of lake Chiemsee, the largest lake in Bavaria. === Neighbourhoods === Übersee is divided into 36 small neighbourhoods: * Albern * Almau * Almfischer * Anger * Angerling * Aumühle * Bachham * Baumgarten * Chiemseemoos * Damberg * Engelstein * Feldwies * Frenthal * Gassen * Gießen * Gries * Gröben * Heinrichwinkel * Heißanger * Hinterbichl * Hocherlach * Luft * Moosen * Neuwies * Reisermann * Schließpoint * Seethal * Stegen * Stegenhäuser * Übersee * Vorderbichl * Wasen * Weidach * Wessen * Westerbuchberg * Windschnur === Neighbouring Municipalities === Übersee's neighbouring municipalities (clockwise from the north-east) are: Grabenstätt, Staudach-Egerndach, Grassau and Bernau am Chiemsee. == References == Category:Traunstein (district)",
