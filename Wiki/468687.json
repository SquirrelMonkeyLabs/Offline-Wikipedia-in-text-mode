Hulu's subscription service was launched in beta (preview) on June 29, 2010, and officially launched on November 17, 2010, under the branding Hulu Plus. The service remained advertising-supported, but it offers an expanded content library including full seasons, day-after access to current season content and more episodes of shows available. Hulu also launched Hulu Plus apps on other types of devices, including mobile, digital media players, and video game consoles. By the end of 2011, Hulu Plus had around 1.5 million subscribers. On April 29, 2015, it was announced that the \"Hulu Plus\" branding would be discontinued, and that the service would be henceforth marketed as simply \"Hulu\" to place it in-line with its subscription-only competitors. By then, the service had grown to 9 million subscribers. == References == == Other websites == * * \"With Hulu, Older Audiences Lead the Way\", The Wall Street Journal Category:2007 establishments in the United States Category:Companies based in California Category:American entertainment websites",
