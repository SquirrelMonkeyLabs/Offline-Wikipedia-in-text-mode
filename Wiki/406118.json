 "text": "The Northeastern United States, or simply the North or the Northeast, is a U.S. region defined by the United States Census Bureau. It consists of the Mid-Atlantic (New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey) and New England (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Maine). The border states of Delaware and Maryland and other states are sometimes included in other definitions of the Northeast, but the Census Bureau considers both states to be part of the Southern United States. Cities in the Northeast include Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City. This table provides information about the population, size (land area), and population density of states in the Northeast, as defined by the Census Bureau. Population density is defined as the population divided by the area of land in the state or region. The rank column in the table shows how the states rank among all 50 states by population density. New Jersey has the highest population density of any state, and the four highest density states are in the Northeast. The rank for the Census Bureau divisions, in pink, is the rank by population density among the country's nine total divisions. The two divisions in the Northeast (Middle Atlantic and New England) are ranked first and third in the 2020 census. The South Atlantic region passed New England in population density between 2010 and 2020. Finally, the entire Northeast is ranked first among the four Census Bureau regions. With 355.8 people per square mile, its population density is about 2.5 times that of the second-ranked region, which is the South.
