 "text": "A machine tool is a machine that cuts, shapes, or forms material. A machine tool has three basic elements: * A work-holding device for holding the material, or workpiece. * A tool-holding device for holding the tool. * A method for guiding the movement of the tool relevant to the workpiece or material. A lathe is one of the oldest types of machine tools. It is most commonly used to make circular cuts in wood or metal. A lathe holds the material to be cut on a rotating spindle, and the spindle is driven by a motor or crank. Machine tools are commonly used to cut and form parts out of metal, but can be designed to work with most materials. Machine tools that are controlled by a computer are called CNC machines. == References == Category:Machines Category:Tools",
