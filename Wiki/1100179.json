 "text": "The Forward (, and formerly known as \"The Jewish Daily Forward\") is an American news media organization for a Jewish American audience. ==History== Founded in 1897 as a Yiddish-language weekly socialist newspaper, The New York Times reported that Seth Lipsky \"started an English-language offshoot of the Yiddish-language newspaper\" as a weekly newspaper in 1990. ==The Forward in English== The Forward began publishing in English in the 1980s. In 2019, both Yiddish and English were being used for their online edition. Funding for the English edition became available when The Forward sold their FM radio station. While the idea was said to have germinated in 1983, when the Yiddish-only paper \"announced that it was going to retreat to weekly publication\" and the actualization of an English edition as an ongoing paper in 1990, by 2010 Seth Lipsky was described as \"formerly editor of the English-language edition\". ===Notable interviews=== * Barack Obama * Alan Dershowitz * Evan Rachel Wood * Josh Shapiro * Ruth Bader Ginsburg * Gal Gadot * Joe Biden * Mandy Patinkin * Natan Sharansky * Dani Shapiro * Nathan Englander * Yossi Klein Halevi == Awards == In 2020, The Forward was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award and won nine Rockower Awards. The Forward won two Religion News Association Awards and 34 Rockower Awards in 2021. In 2022, the Forward won two Religion News Association Awards and a record of 43 Rockower Awards. In 2023, the American Jewish Press Association awarded The Forward 33 Rockower Awards. == Pictures == thumb|left| This November 1, 1936, magazine section of The Forward illustrates its evolution from a Democratic Socialist publication to a Social Democratic supporter of Franklin D.
