 "text": "Inclusive education is an idea in the field of education. It means that persons with disabilities or persons who need special care can learn in schools together with people who do not have special needs. This idea comes from the idea of social justice. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also says that access to education is a human right. Whether the education takes place in schools with all kinds of pupils is a matter of practicality. There is no general rule which can always be followed. Some kinds of disability needs both specially trained teachers, and a separate environment from the normal classrooms. ==Related pages== *Disability *Education *Special education *Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Category:Special education",
