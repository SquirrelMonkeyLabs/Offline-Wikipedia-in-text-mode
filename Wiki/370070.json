 "text": "A new religious movement is a religious or spiritual group that developed after the 19th century. These groups are usually small and have short histories. They are not mainstream religions. According to Encyclopedia Britannica: \"The term new religious movement has been applied to all new faiths that have arisen worldwide over the past several centuries.\" == Characteristics == In most new religious movements: *Most people in the movement converted from another religion. *Parents and children are rarely part of the same movement.Eileen Barker: Perspective: What Are We Studying? In: Nova Religio 8, 2004, Vol. 1, pp. 88–102. *The members are all part of the same social group (for example, the new middle class).Eileen Barker: New religious movements: A practical introduction. Her Majesty’s Stationary Office, London 1989, pp 10f. *There is a charismatic leader. *There is a clear distinction between people who are part of the movement, and those who are not. (This distinction is not so clear in mainstream religions.) *The way the group is organised may change.David G. Bromley, Anson D. Shupe: Anti-Cultism in the United States: Origins, Ideology and Organizational Development. In: Social Compass 42, 1995, pp. 221–236,the statement is on page 228. == Names == New religious movements have also been called sects and cults. These terms are problematic, though, because they have a negative connotation. New religious movements that have been called cults include Scientology, Transcendental Meditation, Unification Church, Family International (also called Children of God), the Branch Davidians, Heaven's Gate and Wicca. ==References==",
