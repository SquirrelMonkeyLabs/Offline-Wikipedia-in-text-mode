 "text": "Filozoa is a clade (a group of plants or animals with a common ancestor) that is in the Opisthokonta clade. It includes animals, and their close single- celled relatives. These relatives are more closely related to animals than they are to fungi, and other Opisthokonts. Three groups are in Filozoa: Filasterea, Choanoflagellatea, and Kingdom Animalia. Animalia is the most important one, which has all proper animals in it. == Evolution == The phylogenic tree (evolution tree) below shows how clades broke into newer clades. This includes Filozoa. == References == Category:Eukaryotes",
