 "text": "In the 14th century, a Javanese manuscript called Nagarakretagama, written by Prapanca in 1365, mentioned Borneo as part of the Hindu Majapahit kingdom. Borneo had to give an annual tribute of 40 katis of camphor. In 1369, Sulu, which was once part of Majapahit, successfully rebelled. They then attacked Boni and invaded the northeast coast of Borneo. After looting the capital and taking treasures, including two sacred pearls, the Sulus were driven away by a fleet from Majapahit. However, Boni was left weaker after the attack. A Chinese report from 1371 described Boni as poor and completely under Majapahit's control. ==Invasion== A huge blow to Jambi, once part of the Sri Vijaya kingdom, came from its old enemy, Java. Between 1338 and 1365, the Majapahit Empire conquered Sumatra, including Jambi, Palembang, and Minangkabau. Majapahit also attacked ports in Borneo, Sumbawa, Ceram, and Lombok, and claimed control over the Riau Archipelago, Anambas, and Natuna Islands. They also took over parts of the Malay Peninsula, including Pahang, Johor, Kelantan, Trengganu, and Singapore. Majapahit’s ruler, Ayam Wuruk, was a conqueror but did not try to settle the areas he conquered. Even today, Majapahit’s influence remains, especially in Kelantan, where the Javanese shadow play and rituals are still practiced. Kelantan also keeps Majapahit- style coins as treasures. == References == Category:Indonesia",
