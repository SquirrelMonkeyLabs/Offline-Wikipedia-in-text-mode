 "text": "Aerostatics is the study of gases that are not in motion. The study of gases in motion is called aerodynamics. It is a part of fluid statics. An aerostat is a lighter than air craft, such as an airship or balloon, which uses the principles of aerostatics to float. ==Fields of study == * Atmospheric pressure fluctuation * Composition of mountain air * Cross-section of the atmosphere * Gas density * Gas diffusion in soil * Gas pressure * Kinetic theory of gases * Partial pressures in gas mixtures * Pressure measurement Category:Aerospace engineering Category:Fluid mechanics",
