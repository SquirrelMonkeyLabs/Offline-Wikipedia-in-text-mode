She is a sister of goddesses Nganu Leima and Shabi Leima. Legend says that all three sisters married the same mortal man. == Etymology == The Meitei female given name \"Khunu Leima\" (ꯈꯨꯅꯨ ꯂꯩꯃ) is made up of two component words. The two words are \"Khunu\" (ꯈꯨꯅꯨ) and \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ). In Meitei, \"Khunu\" (ꯈꯨꯅꯨ) means pigeon. The word \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) is further made up of two component words, \"Lei\" (ꯂꯩ) and \"Ma\" (ꯃ). \"Lei\" (ꯂꯩ) means land or earth. \"Ma\" (ꯃ) means \"mother\". Literally, \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) can be translated as \"Land Mother\" or \"Mother Earth\". But in general context, \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) means a queen or a mistress or a lady. == Description == Goddess Khunu Leima is described as the ruler of all the pigeons of the world. At any time, she could summon all the pigeons at any place she wishes. She is one of the daughters of God Salailen (alias Soraren). == Related pages == * Imoinu (Emoinu) - Meitei goddess of wealth * Ireima (Ereima) - Meitei goddess of water * Leimarel (Leimalel) - Meitei goddess of earth * Ngaleima - Meitei goddess of fish * Panthoibi - Meitei goddess of civilization, love and warfare * Phouoibi (Phouleima) - Meitei goddess of agricultural crops * Thumleima - Meitei goddess of salt == References == == Bibliography == * Glimpses of Manipuri Culture - Dr. Yumlembam Gopi Devi * The History of Manipur: An early period - Wahengbam Ibohal Singh · 1986 == Other websites == * Category:Meitei gods and goddesses Category:Leima",
