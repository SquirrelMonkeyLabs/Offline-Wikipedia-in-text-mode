 "text": "Amir Abdollah Muhammad Mu'izzi (1048-1125) was an 11th century and 12th century poet. He was from Persia, and was the poet laureate of Sanjar. He was from the village of Nisa. He is considered one of the great masters of the Persian panegyric qasideh. He lived in the courts of Malik Shah I and Sultan Sanjar. His divan of 18,000 distichs remain. Anvari says Mu'izzi copied the verses of other poets (this cannot be proven for certain). Anvari himself is known to have copied Mu'izzi's verses. Mu'izzi is said to have died by an arrow shot by the King's son in 1125 for unknown reasons. He was accidentally shot by Sanjar. == Example == Ghazel of Mu'izzi in Tajik: :Эй руйи ту рахшандатар аз киблаи Зардушт, :Бе руйи ту чун зулфи куж аст маро пушт. :Ишки ту маро кушту хавои ту маро сухт, :Чаври ту маро хасту чафои ту маро кушт. :Харчанд хама чавру чафои ту кашидам, :харгиз накунам мехру вафои ту фаромушт. :Бархезу биё то зи руху зулфи ту имшаб, :Пурлола кунам доману пурмушк кунам мушт translation - :Hey your face is brighter than qibla of Zarostra :Without your face and ringlets crooked in my back :Your love killed me and your air burnt me :I have your oppression and your cruelty killed me :Whatever your oppression and cruelty I suffered from :Never I will forget your kindness and loyalty :Get up and come this night :I will make you full of tulips... == Notes == # Granville, E.
