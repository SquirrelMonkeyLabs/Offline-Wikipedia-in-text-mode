 "text": "Yehud Medinata (Aramaic for the State of Judah), or simply Yehud, was part of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. It was located within the satrapy of Eber-Nari. ==Overview== Yehud Medinata was similar to the older Kingdom of Judah but had a smaller territory. The area of Yehud Medinata is roughly the same as the previous Babylonian province of Yehud, created after the Kingdom of Judah was invaded by the Neo-Babylonian Empire (c. 597). Yehud Medinata continued to exist for two centuries, until the Greek Macedonian emperor Alexander the Great conquered it and made it part of his empire. ==History== The exact period for Babylonian and Persian rule is still under debate.
