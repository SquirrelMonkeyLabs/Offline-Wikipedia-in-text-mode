But when shipping delicate electronics and their components, a special plastic type of bubble wrap is used to remove static electricity, this way protecting delicate electronic chips. The air bubbles, that protect easily broken items, can be found in many different sizes â€” from as small as 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) in diameter, to as large as 26 millimeters (1 inch) or more.
