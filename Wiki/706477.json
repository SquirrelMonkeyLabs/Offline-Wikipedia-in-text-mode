 "text": "Hydro is a town in Caddo County, Oklahoma, located on State Highway 58, north of Interstate 40/U.S. Highway 66, and eight miles east of Weatherford. Founded on August 6, 1901, when the Wichita and Caddo Reservation opened for settlement, Hydro was initially named Caddo but was renamed to reflect its abundant well water when the post office was established. The town became known for its agricultural development, particularly in corn and cotton, and served as a shipping point for livestock. The Hydro Review, the area's first newspaper, was launched in 1901, the same year the first school and twelve churches were established. The Hydro Free Fair began in 1904, making it possibly Oklahoma's longest-running free fair. During the Great Depression, significant improvements were made to the townâ€™s infrastructure, including paved streets and new public buildings. In 1941, Carl and Lucille Arthurs Hamons opened the Hamons Courts and a gas station. Although the construction of Interstate 40 in 1966 harmed local Route 66 businesses, Lucille persisted, leading to the service station being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, and the Hamons Tourist Court's sign was displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Hydro's population grew from 524 in 1907 to 948 in 1930, but the Great Depression and Dust Bowl caused a decline. A resurgence occurred during an oil boom in the 1980s, with populations recorded at 1,060 in 2000 and 969 in 2010, many of whom commuted to nearby towns for work. Local agriculture, especially corporate hog farming and wheat harvesting, remains significant. Hydro features natural landmarks known as the Caddo Mounds, Antelope Buttes, and Hydro Mounds, with historical sites like Rock Mary. The town celebrated its centennial in 2001, and as of April 2020, the population was 926. ==References== Category:Towns in Oklahoma",
