 "text": "The Indonesian bubble-nest frog, wine-coloured tree bubble-nest frog, or Javan jelly-nest frog (Feihyla kajau) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. People see this frog in rainforests, sitting on small plants that hang over streams or pools of water. Scientists think the tadpoles swim in the water. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out. Human beings have cut down the trees to build farms, especially for palm oil, and get wood to build with. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Tawau Hills National Park, Danum Valley Conservation Area, Sepilok Orang Utan Conservation Area, and Gunung Mulu National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
