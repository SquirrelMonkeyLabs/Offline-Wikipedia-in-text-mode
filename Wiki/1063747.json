 "text": "Ramses III was the second Pharaoh of the 20th dynasty in Ancient Egypt. He has ruled from 26 March 1186 to 15 April 1155 BC and is considered to be the last great King of the New kingdom. He later fought with the sea people and won against them in a battle known as Battle of the Delta which is considered one of his best achievements He was able to save Egypt from collapsing at the time when many other empires fell during the Late Bronze Age; however, the damage of the invasions took a role in Egypt. == Family == Ramesses III was the son of Setnakhte and Tiy-Merenese. Tiy-merenese. He had a number of wives, including Isis, Titi and Tiy, as well as a number of sons including the next three rulers of Egypt, Ramesses IV ,Vand VI . We only know of one possible daughter named Titi. He was killed in the Harem conspiracy led by his wife Tiye and her eldest son Pentawere. ==Reign== In the fifth year of his rule, some Libyan tribes came to the western part of the Nile River delta and said that the pharaoh was causing trouble for their leader. But really, the Libyans had been taking land that belonged to Egypt for a long time. The Egyptians defeated them in a battle in the western delta after two years of peace. Later, a group of people from North and the Mediterranean islands known as Sea people attacked Egypt by land and sea. Ramses' soldiers stopped them in southern Palestine, and the ships got stuck in the waterways of the deltla, where Egyptians led by Ramses III won against them. Some of these people moved to the coast of Palestine between Gaza and Mount Carmel. This ended Egypt's control over Syria and Palestine. Two more years passed, and another group of Libyan tribes came to the western delta. Ramses defeated them and captured their leader. After this, Ramses finished building a big temple, palace, and town in western Thebes. He also added to a big temple in Thebes and sent a ship to get things from a place called Punt. The Egyptians also mined copper in Sinai and possibly gold in Nubia, which is in the south.Kahn, D. (2016), The Historical Background of a Topographical List of Ramesses III, pp. 161–168 ==Death== At the end of Ramses' life, one of his wives who wasn't the main one wanted her son to become king. She planned to kill Ramses to make this happen. The sources we have say that the plan failed and the people who tried it were put on trial. We didn't know for sure if Ramses was hurt in the attack, because his mummy didn't have any obvious wounds. People talked about this for a long time. In 2012, researchers said that a CT scan showed a deep knife wound in Ramses' throat. This means that he was really killed by the people who tried to make his wife's son the king. Ramses died in Thebes in the 32nd year of his reign, and his son Ramses IV became the new king.King Ramesses III's throat was slit, analysis reveals .
