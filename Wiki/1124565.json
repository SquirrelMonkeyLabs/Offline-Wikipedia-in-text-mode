 "text": "\"Hail Pennsylvania!\" was the former regional anthem of Pennsylvania. It was written by Edgar M. Dilley, a student of the University of Pennsylvania's class of 1897. It was part of a contest to write a song to the melody of \"God Save the Tsar!\", the Russian anthem at the time. Dilley was paid 25 dollars for making it. To this day, the song is the anthem of Scranton, Pennsylvania, despite it not being the state song since 1990. ''' == Lyrics == ''' : Hail!
