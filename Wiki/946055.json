 "text": "The Three Sisters are three types of crops. They are winter squash, maize (\"corn\"), and beans. Native Americans are known to use these crops. They were originally from Mesoamerica (present-day Mexico). Companion planting was often used with these crops. These crops could grow better when combined. The crops were important in Cahokian, Mississippian, Muscogee, Haudenosaunee, Maya, Mandan and Iroquois cultures. The Three Sisters were important for food and trade. The crops, especially maize helped population growth. ==References== Category:Agriculture Category:Native Americans",
