 "text": "Govindapala is believed to be the successor of Madanapala. He is also considered to be the last ruler of the Pala Empire. When Madanapala passed away in 1161 AD, Govindapala took control of the Gaya district. Words like Vinastarajye and Gatarajye, however, are used by those after his fourth year, which most likely indicates that his kingdom was destroyed in 1165. Govindapala's reign most likely spanned Palapala's if he did rule after 1165. His use of the title Gaudeshwara, which translates to \"Lord of Gauda,\" and the suffix \"-pala\" may indicate that he briefly reclaimed Gauda and that, he was the final member of the imperial Pala dynasty. ==References== Category:Pala Empire",
