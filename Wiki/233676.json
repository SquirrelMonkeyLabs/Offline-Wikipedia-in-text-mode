 "text": "A bowl game is a college football game that is played in the post-season. In NCAA football, a team that wins six games during the season may play in the bowl games. A team may enter via invitation or by having the best season record in their conference (it depends on the organizers of the game). Most bowl games also have ties to specific conferences, for instance the Cotton Bowl, which has a contract to select teams from the Southeastern and Pac-12 Conferences specifically.
