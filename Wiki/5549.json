Many of the ideas and features in Microsoft Word came from Bravo, the first graphical writing program. Microsoft bought the Bravo program, and changed its name to Microsoft Word. When it first came out, it was not very popular, and did not sell as well as other writing programs like WordPerfect. Although it was not very popular when it came out, it had a feature called WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), which meant that people can change the visual style of writing (e.g. bold, italics), by selecting and formatting text, when in other programs like WordPerfect, people had to add special 'codes' to change the style of writing. WYSIWYG is now a common feature of all computer writing programs. === Versions === There are versions for Microsoft Word for other operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows. New versions support fewer operating systems, although they always support Windows. === For Microsoft Windows === * Word for Windows 1.1, for Windows 3.0 came out in March, 1990. * Word for Windows 1.1a, for Windows 3.1 came out in June, 1990. * Word for Windows 2.0, came out in 1991. * Word for Windows 6.0, came out in 1993. * Word for Windows 95 (sometimes called Word 7), came out in 1995. * Word 97 (sometimes called Word 8), came out in 1997. * Word 2000 (sometimes called Word 9), came out in 1999. * Word 2002 (sometimes called Word 10 or Word XP), came out in 2001. * Word 2007 which required Windows XP Service Pack 2. * Word 2019 which is latest version of Microsoft Word to support Windows XP Professional 64-bit edition. === For macOS === * Word 1.0 for Mac came out on January 18, 1985. * Word 3.0 for Mac came out on January 31, 1987.

Without configuration the program saved the document in a proprietary file format, so other programs could not open it. When the user sent his document to a friend, the friend needed a copy of Microsoft Word to read the document. Then that friend would probably also save documents in the same secret format of Word. This gave Microsoft Word a dominant position. == Other websites == * Official website * www.office.com Category:Microsoft Office Category:Word processors",
