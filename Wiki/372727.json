 "text": "Bane is a fictional Batman character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Chuck Dixon, Doug Moench, and Graham Nolan, he made his debut in Batman: Vengeance of Bane #1 (January 1993). He is one of Batman's most physical and smarter villains credited to be the only character in comic books who has broken the bat, both physically and mentally. == Fictional character biography == Born in a prison on a remote Caribbean island, Bane was raised without pity or compassion. He is physically strong and wears a Mexican wrestlers mask. He has a tube that connects from his body to a chemical tank that is strapped to his suit that keeps him strong. == Powers and abilities == He utilizes the super-steroid known as Venom to enhance his own physical attributes to superhuman levels, namely his strength, durability, speed, and endurance. == In other media == He is played by Jeep Swanson in Batman & Robin and by Tom Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises. In Batman & Robin, Bane appears like in the comics with a Mexican wrestling mask, but doesn't talk. In The Dark Knight Rises, Bane has a mask that only covers the front of his mouth and nose, his eyes can be seen and he had a muffled voice with a Caribbean accent. ==References== Category:Batman characters Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1993 Category:Fictional mass murderers",
