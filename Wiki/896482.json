 "text": "Intent to Kill is an American 1992 independent thriller, crime drama and action movie. It is about drug trafficking, police activity and prostitution. This movie was rated NC-17 (no one seventeen and under) by the United States' Motion Picture Association of America. The reason is extreme violence. This was the first movie rated so for graphic violence instead of sexual content (like most NC-17s are). ==Plot== A police detective named Vickie Stewart is undercover. She and her partner Al are on drug operations. They are searching the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The drug operation, however, takes a turn into the negative and unthinkable. Gangsters fire their weapons against the police. Vehicles began blowing up into fire. Several thugs and police officials are killed during the chaos. One major drug trafficker, Salvador, gets away and evades (avoids arrest by) police. But he forgets almost $5 million of his drugs. Salvador is an official member for the Colombian Cowboys. They're a local drug trafficking street gang. The next morning at the station of the Los Angeles Police Department, following Salvador getting away and several police losses, Captain Jackson removes Stewart from the drug case. Later, she and the other police captain question and deal with a Hispanic prostitute by the name of Maria. She tells Vickie and the captain several of her friends raped her. But the police captain doesn't believe Maria and objectifies her. He interferes with Maria's right for filing charges against the rapists. Maria and Vickie enter the latter's late 1980s Pontiac Grand Prix two-door coupe. Vickie uses her nightstick beats two of the rapists with that weapon. She then enters the house and meets the fifth suspect. He (the suspect) is using cocaine. The suspect requests Vickie to drop her weapon and remove her clothes. She, instead, pulls her gun and fires it. The bullet blasts the cocaine-holding glass container, which shatters. She then orders the suspect to grab the phone and dial 9-1-1 (the emergency number in North America). Meanwhile (at exactly the same time) Salvador gets several orders from his crime boss. The latter (the boss) orders Salvador to get back the drugs within a week. Otherwise, he (Salvador) will be killed. Over the next few days, several people are knocked off (or killed) across the city as Salvador and his confidants look for their drugs. Vickie goes to the local park. But then, later she gets home and finds her partner in bed with a brunette woman he met at the local bar. Vickie gets angry, pulls Al's car from the garage of the residence and blows the vehicle up. She then drives away from there. Vicki later teaches martial arts training as self-defense tactics. Later, a police-gangster gun conflict takes place. Several police officials are killed. That includes Vickie's new boyfriend and police partner. That same evening, Salvador and his confidants infiltrate (or head inside) the premises where the crime boss and the boss' friends are waiting. Salvador and his friends then shoot the boss and them to death. Following a standoff where Vickie gets held hostage, she and Salvador get into a chase with the latter's stolen police car. The chase ends after both police cars hit the trailer of a semi tractor trailer and then turn over. Vickie then shoots Salvador dead with a shotgun. ==Cast== * Traci Lords as Vicki Stewart * Yaphet Kotto as Captain Jackson * Scott Patterson as Al * Elena Sahagun as Mia * Sabrina Ferrand as Maria * Kevin Benton as Black Drug Dealer ==Release and classification in outside countries== Under the Australian Classification Board, when the movie was released on VHS, the system rated Intent to Kill MA15+ for \"coarse language, medium level violence and drug content\".
