 "text": "The Gili Islands (Indonesian:Tiga Gili [Three Gilis], Kepulauan Gili [Gili Islands]) are a group of three small islands (or archipelago) – Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air — very close to the northwest coast of Lombok, Indonesia. The islands are a popular destination for Western tourists. Each island has several small resorts, usually consisting of a small collection of huts for tourists, and a restaurant.

Bicycles or the horse-drawn carriages called a cidomo are common transportation on the islands. Scuba diving in and around the Gilis is also popular.
