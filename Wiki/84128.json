 "text": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a novel written by the Irish writer James Joyce. It was first printed as a book in 1916. It tells the story of Stephen Dedalus, a young man who is trying to be a writer in Dublin. The story begins from his childhood and ends with him deciding to go to Paris and leave Dublin, his hometown, to become a writer. The book is written in a new style of writing called stream of consciousness. Therefore, the beginning of the book is very simple while the later parts become less simple. It shows how, when a person grows up, the language he or she uses becomes more and more complex. == Other websites == * * Searchable, self-referential edition of Portrait, with concordance * SparkNotes study guide * The Literature Network * Bibliomania * Google Earth Placeset for A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man Category:Works of James Joyce Category:1910s books Category:Irish novels Category:1916 works",
