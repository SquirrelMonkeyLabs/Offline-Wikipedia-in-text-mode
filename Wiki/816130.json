 "text": "The Quagga mussel is a freshwater mussel. Originally it occurred in the drainage basin of the Dnieper river, mostly in Ukraine. The mussel is named after the Quagga, an extinct species of zebra. The mussels live for three to five years. Since about the 1940s, they have spread a lot outside their original range. They are considered an invasive species in most of Europe, and North America. It looks like certain species of perch have developed an appetite for thes mussels. They are now considered as a natural form of pest control. == References == Category:Bivalves",
