He gained prominence for his involvement in investigating the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, a major financial controversy involving Malaysian state investment funds. In July 2015, Abdul Gani told the police that there was enough information to charge Prime Minister Najib Razak. Later, Abdul Gani was removed from his job due to \"health reasons\" and Mohamed Apandi Ali took over. On 16 May 2018, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that after meeting with Abdul Gani, Abdul Gani told him he was getting ready to charge Najib before Najib removed him. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1955 births",
