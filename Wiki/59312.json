Ayatollah Shahroudi was best known for ordering a moratorium on stoning as a form of the death penalty. However, later it was shown that executions by stoning are still being carried out, in spite of his claims that they have stopped. Stoning is still happening inside prisons, where the public cannot see it. From August 2017 to December 2018, Shahroudi was Chairman of Expediency Discernment Council. He died on 24 December 2018 from cancer in Tehran at the age of 70.Chairman of Iran’s Expediency Council Passes Away ==References== ==Other websites== * Text: Human Rights Watch Protests Media Crackdown, Detentions in Iran (April 2000) * Iran veil crackdown criticised APRIL 24, 2007 Category:Chief Justices of Iran Category:Cancer deaths in Iran Category:1948 births Category:2018 deaths",
