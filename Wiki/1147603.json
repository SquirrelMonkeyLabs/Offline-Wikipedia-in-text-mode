 "text": "On 10 November 2024, at 11:49 EST (16:49 UTC), a 6.8 earthquake hit southern Cuba. It was located offshore, with an epicenter south-southwest of Bartolomé Masó, and happened at a depth of . == Tectonic setting == The southern coast of Cuba is next to the North American plate. There was a big fault line called the Septentrional-Oriente fault. The North American plate moves west compared to the Gonâve Microplate at 6 to 11 mm per year. This area is where most earthquakes in Cuba happen, with major ones in 1766, 1917, 1932, 1947, 1992, and 2020. == Earthquake == The earthquake had a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). About 2.1 million people felt moderate shaking or stronger. Light shaking was also felt in Jamaica and western Haiti, with reports from Florida and the Cayman Islands. The quake happened along a fault moving sideways, with the fault line running east-west and slanting steeply to the north. A 5.9 foreshock happened at 15:50 UTC (10:50 EST), also registering an estimated Mercalli intensity of VII (Very Strong). == Impact == Ten people were injured from the earthquake. Seventy-eight homes were destroyed, while 5,116 others, along with 474 public buildings, a dock, and the Faro Vargas lighthouse were damaged. The earthquake struck just four days after Hurricane Rafael, which caused a power outage across the island. This outage was still ongoing during the earthquake, making it hard for officials to give updates. The shaking was felt across eastern Cuba, including big cities like Santiago de Cuba. == References == Category:2024 in North America Category:2020s in Cuba Category:2024 earthquakes Category:2024 disasters Category:November 2024 events Category:Earthquakes in North America",
