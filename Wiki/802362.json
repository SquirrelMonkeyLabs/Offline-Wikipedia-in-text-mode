In 1954, she worked in the municipal troupe of the Arab Theater directed by the Egyptian Zéki Touleïmat. The following year, Mohamed Agrebi recruited her for the Tunis municipality troupe he directed, and subsequently she became a subscriber to leading roles in most of the plays. In the wake of this early success, she obtained a diploma in drama. In 1957, she successfully passed the recruitment competition for full-time actors for the needs of the troupe in the city of Tunis. Mouna Noureddine is as comfortable on stage as in front of the cameras, interpreting texts in Tunisian as well as in literal Arabic as well as in French. She went on stage at the age of 15, making the theater merge with her life, to such an extent that the meeting of the one who will share her life and give her his pseudonym - Noureddine Kasbaoui - takes place during the rehearsals of a play by William Shakespeare: The Merchant of Venice. Mouna Noureddine performs many roles in the troupe's repertoire, notably under the direction of Aly Ben Ayed: Sakr Kouraïch, Al Hallaj, Yerma, Le maréchal, Ghira Tedhraféchira, Hamlet, Elloghz, Leïla men elf lila, Ors eddam, Mejnoun Leïla, Mourad III, Beït Bernard alba, Ahl el berak, Caligula, Atchane ya sabaya, Les Troyennes, etc. In the cinema, she plays in a large number of Tunisian films including Khalifa le teigneux, Sejnane, Fatma 75, And tomorrow ...?, Cécile's eyes, L’Homme de cendres, The thief of tasting, The season of men, etc. Each of his performances, in Tunisia as well as in the Maghreb and in Europe, earned him consecration, critical praise and public ovation. She plays in the found of the city of Tunis at the Théatre des Nations, the Récamier, the Théâtre de la ville, the Théâtre de l'Odéon, the Beethoven Festival, in Iran and in Egypt. After half a century of activity, alongside her status as director of the Tunis city troupe since 2002 - a first since the creation of this company - she continues to perform in Tunisian and international productions as well as on stage. For the whole of her career, in 1985 she obtained the honorary prize of the Ministry of Culture and Heritage Protection, the insignia of the Order of Cultural Merit and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Insignia of the Republic of Tunisia. She is also honored several times in many theater festivals in Tunisia and abroad. == Filmography == === Cinema === ==== Feature films ==== * 1958 : Goha by Jacques Baratier * 1969 : Khlifa the stingy by Hamouda Ben Halima * 1971 : And tomorrow...? by Brahim Babaï * 1972 : Au pays du Tararanni (In the land of Tararanni) by Hamouda Ben Halima, Hedi Ben Khalifa and Férid Boughedir * 1974 : Sejnane by Abdellatif Ben Ammar * 1975 : ** Fatma 75 by Salma Baccar ** Ragol Bima'n Al-Kalima (A manly man) by Nader Galal (English) * 1976 : Echebka, Rayha Wayn (Where is going the engagement?) by Ghouti Bendeddouche * 1980 : Aziza by Abdellatif Ben Ammar * 1982 : ** Shadow of the Earth by Taïeb Louhichi ** The Ballad of Mamelouk by Abdulhafidh Bouassida : Fatma ** Maazoufet El Matar (The rain song) by Abdellah Rezzoug (English) * 1986 : ** Man of Ashes by Nouri Bouzid : Nefissa ** Sabra Walwuhush (Sabra and the Monsters) by Habib Mselmani * 1988 : Sama (Sky) (ar) by Néjia Ben Mabrouk * 1989 : ** The Barbarian by Mireille Darc ** Layla, my reason (ar) by Taïeb Louhichi * 1990 : Nomad heart by Fitouri Belhiba * 1992 : ** The Sultan of the Medina by Moncef Dhouib ** Les Zazous de la vague (The Zazous of the wave) by Mohamed Ali Okbi * 1994 : The wind of fates by Ahmed Djemai * 1996 : ** A Summer in La Goulette by Férid Boughdir ** Honey and Ashes by Nadia Fares Anliker * 1997 : Keswa (the lost thread) (ht) by Kelthoum Bornaz : the mother * 2000 : The Season of Men by Moufida Tlatli : the matriarch * 2015 : The sky's limits (ar) by Fares Naanaa * 2018 : Look at me by Nejib Belkadhi ==== Short films ==== * 1973 : Azziara (The Visit) by Hédi Ben Khalifa * 2010 : The Wave by Mohamed Ben Attia === Television === ==== Tunisian TV serials ==== * 1988 : Ib7ath m3ana (Inspect with us) by Abderrazak Hammami (episode of The Eclipse of the Earth) : Aziza * 1992 : Liyam Kif Errih (Days are Like Wind) by Slaheddine Essid : Jalila * 1994 : ** Ghada by Khaled Mansour, Habib Jemni and Nabil Bessaida (guest of honor) ** Amwej (Waves) by Slaheddine Essid : Fatma * 1995 : ** Habbouni wedalalt (I am the family's spoiled brat) by Slaheddine Essid : Habiba ** Normal days by Habib Mselmani : Wahida * 1995 and 2000 : Edhak Ledonia (Always keep your smile.
