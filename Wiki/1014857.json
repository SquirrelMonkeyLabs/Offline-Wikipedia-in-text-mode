 "text": "Muerte cruzada (; \"mutual death\", lit. \"crossed death\") is the name given for a constitutional measure found in Article 148 of the 2008 Constitution of Ecuador. It gives the President of the Republic the power to dissolve the National Assembly, however a new presidential and legislative election must be held within a certain amount of months afterwards. A regular election for a full four-year period of office then takes place. In September 2010, the Constitutional Court called it as \"a checks-and-balances tool\". This measure was used once since it was created by President Guillermo Lasso in May 2023. ==References== Category:Politics of Ecuador",
