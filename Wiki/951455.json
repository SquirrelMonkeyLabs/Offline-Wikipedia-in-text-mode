 "text": "The Cajun chorus frog (Pseudacris fouquettei) is a frog. It lives in the United States. It lives in all of Louisiana and parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi. The largest adult male frogs are 30 mm long from nose to rear end and the smallest adult female frogs are 27 mm long. Adults are light brown or pink-brown in color with three darker brown stripes on their backs. Some have lines of spots instead of stripes. Some have neither. The iris of the eye is gold in color. There is a red-brown stripe from the nose all the way to the back legs. The skin of the belly is lighter in color with some dark marks. The throat can be yellow-brown in color. This frog mostly looks for food during the day. The female frog lays 500 to 1500 eggs at a time. The eggs stick to plants. The adult frogs do not go far from the water. They eat small animals without bones, for example, beetles, ants, and flies. Scientists think the tadpoles eat algae and dead plants. Some animals eat the tadpoles, for example spiders and beetles. Small snakes, for example garter snakes eat the adult frogs. Scientists think birds, turtles, and some mammals might eat this frog too. They have never seen what the frog does to try to get away. This frog is not in danger of dying out, but there are fewer of them than there were in the past. This is because of humans build things where the frogs would live and because of disease. This frog is closely related to Pseudacris nigrita and these frogs can have young together. The hybrid frogs, which have one P. nigrita parent and one P. foquettei parent, are healthy. Scientists think the two species may be joining together. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
