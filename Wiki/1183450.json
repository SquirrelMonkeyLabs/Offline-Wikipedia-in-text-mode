 "text": "Known as the \"Silk Stocking\" regiment, the 7th Regiment of the New York Militia served as an infantry unit in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The 7th Militia was a pre-war New York Militia unit that was drafted into federal service for the Civil War. It was often referred to as the \"Blue- Bloods\" because a disproportionate percentage of its soldiers belonged to the social elite of New York City. During the chaos caused by the British shooting at American warships off Sandy Hook in April 1806, the regiment, which is based in New York City, was established as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th companies. Officially reconstituted by the state on June 25, 1861, they became a component of the state's uniformed militia and were assigned to the First Brigade of the Battalion of Artillery, which was commanded by Maj. Andrew Sitcher. The battalion changed its name to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, New York State Militia on April 5, 1807. These four companies, along with additional volunteers, were temporarily constituted as a regiment under the leadership of Col. in 1807 when tensions with the United Kingdom escalated.",
