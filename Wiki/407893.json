The club was formed through a merge of the clubs Listers IF and Hälleviks IF. Mjällby plays at their current home stadium Strandvallen with a capacity of 7500 people. Their rivals are often considered to be Kalmar FF because they are the closest team to Mjällby. == The fall to Division 1 and the climb back up == At the end of the 2014 season Mjällby was degraded from the top tier Allsvenskan to the second tier Superettan. It didn't go well for Mjällby in Superettan when they came 13th and lost the relegation qualifiers against Örgryte IS. 2017 they got second place and played the promotion qualification against Örgryte again, they won 2-1 at home but lost the second leg 3-1. 2018 was finally the year for Mjällby as they won Division 1 Södra and will be playing Superettan 2019. Although Mjällby was tipped to finish at the bottom the surprised everyone and got 1st, they went up and are still playing in the Allsvenskan today! ==Other websites== * Official website Category:1939 establishments in Sweden Category:Swedish football clubs",
