 "text": "Rexall Pharmacy Group ULC is a Canadian chain of pharmacies. They are headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario. They have 400 store locations all across Canada. In 1904, American drug store tycoon Louis K. Liggett helped create United Drug Stores after getting 40 independent drug stores to come together and invest $4,000 into a retailers' cooperative. In 1997, the Katz Group of Companies purchased the Pharma Plus company which was founded and grew alongside United Drug Company and they both merged to become Rexall Pharmacy Group. In November 2003, Rexall purchased the naming rights for Skyreach Centre, home of the Edmonton Oilers, and renamed it to Rexall Place. It lasted until 2016 when the Oilers moved to a new arena. On December 14, 2016, Rexall was sold by the Katz Group of Companies to McKesson Canada for $3 billion. They sold 28 stores to get approved by the Competition Bureau. Rexall has their own loyalty rewards program called Be Well which replace their former partner Air Miles. On December 20, 2024, McKesson sold Rexall to Birch Hill Equity Partners (BHEP). == References == ==Other website== * Category:1900s establishments in Canada Category:1904 establishments Category:Companies based in Ontario Category:Pharmacies of Canada",
