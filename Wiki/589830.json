 "text": "Janusz Ryszard Korwin-Mikke (often referred to by his initials JKM; born 27 October 1942) is a Polish politician, writer, and the founder of the right- wing libertarian and Eurosceptic political party Wolność. In 2019, he was elected as a member of the Sejm. He was a Member of the European Parliament from 2014 to 2018. He was the leader of the Congress of the New Right (KNP), which was formed in 2011 from Liberty and Lawfulness, which he led from its formation in 2009, and the Real Politics Union (UPR – Unia Polityki Realnej), which he led from 1990 to 1997 and from 1999 to 2003. Korwin-Mikke was the chairman of the KORWiN party (along with Przemysław Wipler, Polish MP, and Robert Iwaszkiewicz, MEP), which was formed by part of the Congress of the New Right. Korwin-Mikke is a perennial candidate in Polish presidential elections. He won 2.4% votes in 1995, 1.43% in 2000, 1,4% in 2005, 2.48% in 2010, 3.3% in 2015. He lost reelection in 2023 after making controversial comments about underage girls. Before the election, during an interview, Korwin-Mikke said: \"There are girls that are 12-13 years old and are mature and there are girls that are 19 years old and are immature. State shouldn't decide when girl achieved sexual maturity, it is determined by nature.\" This led to a massive drop in popular support for his party. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:MEPs for Poland Category:People from Warsaw Category:Polish politicians",
