It lives in Myanmar and Thailand, between 884 and 2020 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog might be in danger of dying out because human beings cut down the forests where it lives. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Panlaung and Padalin Cave Wildlife Sanctuary. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
