 "text": "is a Japanese manga and anime series and franchise about the character Doraemon. It was written and illustrated by Fujiko Fujio. It was started in a childrenâ€™s magazine in 1969. Doraemon is the name of a robot cat without ears that came from the future to help a boy named Nobita Nobi. Doraemon is about the life of Nobita Nobi. In a typical story Doramon uses a gadget to solve a problem for Nobita, but Nobita goes too far and ends up being punished and learning a lesson. Doraemon was turned into an anime television show in 1973 (the original 1973 series is now considered lost media). It still is being shown on television. As of 1996, about 100 million comic books have been sold. A Japanese-to-English version of the original called Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future was published from 2002. A local translation is published in each Asian country such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Vietnam. It is in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, but it is not as popular as it is in Asia. Doraemon is endorsed by 7-11 in Thailand as a mascot. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Doraemon: A cat-like robot from the 22nd century. After being asked to by Sewashi Nobi, Doraemon came to the present to help Nobita. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket which holds many gadgets. He loves the Japanese traditional pastry Dorayaki, and has a strong fear of mice. * Nobita Nobi: He is a fourth grader, and Sewashi's great-great- grandfather. Lazy and unathletic, he always ends up being screamed at by his peers, or his parents. He frequently asks for Doraemon's help. * Shizuka Minamoto: She's Nobita's classmate, and his crush. A kind and caring girl, always willing to help out. She can play both the piano, and the violin, although so badly that it terrifies the neighbourhood. * Takeshi Gouda (Gian): He's another one of Nobita's classmates, and the neighbourhood bully. Strong and always infuriated, he often bullies kids and takes their stuff as his, especially Nobita. He works at a small grocery shop with his mother, who he's terrified of. * Suneo Honekawa: Another of Nobita's classmates, and Gian's wingman. He's selfish and arrogant, and has the typical richy-rich attitude, always flaunting his wealth. ===Recurring=== * Hidetoshi Dekisugi: One of Nobita's classmates, though he's his complete opposite. Talented, athletic, smart and kind, he's always on top of his class, which annoys Nobita to no end. * Sewashi Nobi: He is Nobita's great-great-grandson, and the first child Doraemon took care of. He is the one who sends Doraemon to the 21st century to help Nobita. * Dorami: She is Doraemon's younger sister. She's happy and optimistic, having a cutesy personality. She loves melon bread, and is terrified of cockroaches. She lives with Sewashi in the future. * Jaiko Gouda: Gian's sister, and an artist. She's the opposite of her brother, personality wise, being shy and insecure. Without Doraemon's help, Nobita would've married her, and sent his family into deep financial bankruptcy. Several other characters compose the world of Doraemon, and have played all kinds of roles. ==Worldwide date== * December 15, 1969 (Japan) * June 24, 1970 (UK) * November 23, 1970 (USA) * April 10, 1971 (Australia) * July 13, 1971 (Canada) * September 5, 1971 (New Zealand) * August 27, 1971 (Ireland) * May 31, 1971 (Brazil) * October 18, 1971 (Iceland) * December 15, 1971 (France) * November 15, 1972 (Spain) * September 14, 1973 (Germany) == References == Category:Manga Category:Anime",
