 "text": "Quantum healing is a pseudo-scientific mixture of ideas which claim to draw on quantum mechanics, psychology, philosophy, and neurophysiology. Advocates of quantum healing say that quantum phenomena govern health and wellbeing. Quantum healing is a form of alternative medicine. Deepak Chopra coined the term \"quantum healing\" when he published the first edition of his book with that title in 1989. His discussions of quantum healing have been characterised as technobabble - \"incoherent babbling strewn with scientific terms\" which drives those who actually understand physics \"crazy\" and as \"redefining Wrong\". == References == Category:Alternative medicine",
