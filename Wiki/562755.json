 "text": "The National Museum of Computing is a museum in the United Kingdom dedicated to collecting and restoring old computer systems. The museum is based at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. It opened in 2007. The building — Block H — was built in 1944. At the end of World War II it housed six Colossus computers. It is the first computer centre in the world. The museum has a rebuilt Colossus computer. It also has an exhibition of the most complex code cracking activities that were performed at Bletchley Park during World War II. More modern computers can be seen. They show the history of the development of computing from the 1940s to the present day. The museum tries to have these machines in working order. Although located on the Bletchley Park \"campus\", The National Museum of Computing is an entirely separate charity. It receives no public funding. It relies on the generosity of donors and supporters. Tickets for admission to the museum are separate from those for the other museum on the site. ==References== Category:Museums in England Category:National museums Category:History of computing Category:Scientific organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Buckinghamshire",
