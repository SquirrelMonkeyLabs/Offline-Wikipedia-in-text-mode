 "text": "Fedora Linux is a distribution (or distro) of Linux. It is developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora is designed to be safe and is used by companies and governments. Fedora's mission statement is: \"Fedora is about the rapid progress of Free and Open Source software.\" Linus Torvalds, author of the Linux kernel, says he uses Fedora because it had fairly good support for PowerPC when he used that processor architecture. He became used to the operating system and continues to use it. ==Releases== ===Fedora Core 1 - 4=== Fedora Core 1, codenamed Yarrow, was the first version of Fedora. It was released on November 6, 2003,. Fedora Core 1 was based on Red Hat Linux 9 and shipped with version 2.4.19 of the Linux kernel, version 2.4 of the GNOME desktop environment, and version 3.1.4 of KDE (the K Desktop Environment). Fedora Core 2, codenamed Tettnang, was released on May 18, 2004. It shipped with Linux 2.6, GNOME 2.6, KDE 3.2.2, and SELinuxSELinux was disabled by default due to concerns that it changed the way that Fedora Core ran. XFree86 was replaced by the newer X.org, a merger of the previous official X11R6 release, which additionally included a number of updates to Xrender, Xft, Xcursor, fontconfig libraries, and other significant improvements. Fedora Core 3, codenamed Heidelberg, was released on November 8, 2004. This was the first release of Fedora Core to include the Mozilla Firefox web browser, as well as support for the Indic languages. This release also replaced the LILO boot loader with GRUB. SELinux was also enabled by default, but with a new targeted policy, which was less strict than the policy used in Fedora Core 2. Fedora Core 3 shipped with GNOME 2.8 and KDE 3.3. It was the first release to include the new Fedora Extras repository. Fedora Core 4, codenamed Stentz, was released on June 13, 2005. It shipped with Linux 2.6.11, KDE 3.4 and GNOME 2.10. This version introduced the new Clearlooks theme, which was inspired by the Red Hat Bluecurve theme. It also shipped with the OpenOffice.org 2.0 office suite, as well as Xen, a high performance and secure open source virtualization framework. It also introduced support for the PowerPC CPU architecture, and over 80 new policies for SELinux. ===Fedora Core 5 - 6=== The last two cores introduced specific artwork for that version. This is a trend that has continued in later Fedora versions. Fedora Core 5, codenamed Bordeaux, was released on March 20, 2006. It introduced the Fedora Bubbles artwork. It was the first Fedora release to include Mono and tools built with it such as Beagle, F-Spot and Tomboy. It also introduced new package management tools such as pup and pirut (see Yellow dog Updater, Modified). This release replaced the old LinuxThreads, with the Native POSIX Thread Library. Fedora Core 6, codenamed Zod, was released on October 24, 2006. This release introduced the Fedora DNA artwork, replacing the Fedora Bubbles artwork used in Fedora Core 5. The codename is derived from the infamous villain, General Zod, from the Superman DC Comic Books. This version introduced support for the Compiz compositing window manager and AIGLX (a technology that enables GL-accelerated effects on a standard desktop). It shipped with Firefox 1.5 as the default web browser, and Smolt, a tool that allows users to inform developers about the hardware they use. None of these distributions are maintained by the Fedora Project. === Fedora 10 === Fedora 10, codenamed Cambridge, was released on November 25, 2008. === Version history === Color Meaning Red Release no longer supported Green Release still supported Blue Future release Project Name Version Code name Release date Kernel version Fedora Core 1 Yarrow 2003–11–05 2.4.19 2 Tettnang 2004–05–18 2.6.5 3 Heidelberg 2004–11–08 2.6.9 4 Stentz 2005–06–13 2.6.11 5 Bordeaux 2006–03–20 2.6.15 6 Zod 2006–10–24 2.6.18 Fedora 7 Moonshine 2007–05–31 2.6.21 8 Werewolf 2007–11–08 2.6.23 9 Sulphur 2008–05–13 2.6.25 10 Cambridge 2008–11–25 2.6.27 11 Leonidas 2009–06–09 2.6.29 12 Constantine 2009–11–17 2.6.31 13 Goddard 2010–05–11 2.6.33 14 Laughlin 2010-11-02 2.6.35 15 Lovelock 2011-05-24 2.6.38 16 Verne 2011-11-08 3.1.0 17 Beefy Miracle 2012-05-29 3.3.7 18 Spherical Cow Late 2012 3.6 19 Schrödinger's Cat 2013-07-02 3.9 20 Heisenbug 2013-12-17 3.11 21 2014-12-09 3.17 22 2015-05-26 4.0 23 2015-11-03 4.2 24 2016-06-21 4.5 25 2016-11-22 4.8 26 2017-07-11 4.11 27 2017-11-14 4.13 28 2018-05-01 4.16 29 2018-10-30 4.18 30 2019-04-30 5.0 31 2019-10-22 5.3 32 2020-04-21 ===Fedora gallery=== File:Fedora_Core_1.png|Fedora Core 1 File:Fedora_Core_2.png|Fedora Core 2 File:Fedora_Core_3.png|Fedora Core 3 File:Fedora_Core_4.png|Fedora Core 4 File:Fedora_Core_5.png|Fedora Core 5 File:Fedora Core 6 Desktop.png|Fedora Core 6 File:Fedora_7_Desktop.png|Fedora 7 File:Fedora 8 GNOME.png|Fedora 8 File:Fedora.png|Fedora 9 File:Fedora 10 GNOME.png|Fedora 10 File:Fedora 11 GNOME.png|Fedora 11 File:Fedora_12_Constantine_GNOME.png|Fedora 12 File:Fedora 14 GNOME.png|Fedora 14 == Package == Fedora's official software package repositoryArchLinux.org, \"Official repositories,\" excerpt, \"A software repository is a storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed on a computer\"; retrieved 2012-6-7. includes, for example, UNetbootin.Fedora, Package unetbootin; retrieved 2012-6-7. ==Related pages== * List of Linux distributions == References == == Other websites == * Fedora Project homepage * Fedora Core Category:X86-64 Linux distributions Category:Operating systems",
