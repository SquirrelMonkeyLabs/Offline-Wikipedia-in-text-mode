 "text": "Delta Center is an multi-use arena located in Salt Lake City, Utah that serves as the home for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Utah Mammoth of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was also home to the Utah Starzz of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 1997 until 2002. They first started to build the stadium on May 22, 1990. The arena opened on October 9, 1991 and the first event was a concert by Oingo Boingo. The Jazz had their first pre-season game in the arena on October 24, 1991. In the game, they were defeated by the New York Knicks 101â€“95. When the arena first opened on October 21, 2005, the arena's naming rights were owned by Delta Air Lines and the arena was named the Delta Center. During the Olympics, the arena would be temporarily renamed as Salt Lake Ice Center. Delta decided not to renew their license and the naming rights were bought by EnergySolutions on September 30, 2006 and the arena was renamed EnergySolutions Arena. The name lasted until October 26, 2015 when naming rights were bought by home security provider Vivint. The arena was renamed Vivint Smart Home Arena, and later just Vivint Arena in 2020. The naming rights were bought back by Delta Air Lines on January 14, 2023 and they renamed the arena back to its original name, the Delta Center. When the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Delta Center would be temporarily renamed the Salt Lake Ice Center and would be the host of figure skating and short-track speed skating events. The National Hockey League (NHL) have hosted their Frozen Fury preseason games at the arena since 2021. On April 18, 2024, Salt Lake City was officially granted an expansion franchise by the National Hockey League Board of Governors. The team, later announced with the temporary name of Utah Hockey Club, would take over the Arizona Coyotes, who went inactive because they were unable to build a proper NHL arena. The team announced its permanent name of Utah Mammoth in May 2025. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Buildings and structures in Utah Category:Olympic venues",
