 "text": "Neper was the god of grains, specifically grains that were significant in Ancient Egyptian times, such as wheat and barley. His name means lord of the mouth. Neper also represented sustenance and nourishment. It was said that he predicted the times of the year when the crops grew, were harvested, and disappeared. He was worshipped mainly because he was a god that kept people healthy through their food. == Mythology == Neper was a god in human form. However, he had distinctive marks to represent grains. He had dots on his clothing to represent corn grains. He also had grains above his head, like in the picture to the left. He was also often shown carrying wheat, or similar crops. He wore little clothes, like in the picture where it shows him wearing a cloth around his waist. Neper was worshipped all over Egypt. Neper had a female version of himself, called Nepit. Nepit was the goddess of grain. Neper's mother, Renenutet, was a goddess of nourishment, and harvesting, who also represented grains. == References == Category:Egyptian gods and goddesses",
