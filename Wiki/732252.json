 "text": "B-17 Bomber is a single-player video game that came out for Mattel's Intellivision console in 1982. The game came with the Intellivoice voice synthesis module, which is used to tell the player what enemies are doing off- screen. ==Gameplay== The aim of the game is to get points by attacking targets shown on a map with bombs. The map represented continental Europe and the seas around it. There are four categories of targets: Antiaircraft guns, airports, factories and ships. ==Reception== In 1983, Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games said that B-17 Bomber was his favorite game that used the Intellivoice, enjoying the voices and saying the game and others \"made the voice an integral part of game play\". B-17 Bomber was enjoyed very much, getting a Certificate of Merit in the category of \"1984 Best Videogame Audio-Visual Effects (Less than 16K ROM)\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. ==References== ==Other websites== * B-17 Bomber at GameFAQs Category:1982 video games Category:Intellivision games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:World War II video games",
