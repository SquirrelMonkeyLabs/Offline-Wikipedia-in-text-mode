 "text": "In history, politics and religion, a purge is a removal from a job or powerful position of people who are considered undesirable or dangerous by those in power from a government, another organization, their team leaders, or society as a whole. A group undertaking such an action is labeled as purging itself. Purging is a form of persecution. Purges can be either nonviolent or violent; the nonviolent purges are often done by the simple removal of people from their jobs or a powerful position, and the violent purges are often done by the imprisonment, exile, or murder (either through execution through a show trial or through extrajudicial killing without a trial) of those who have been purged. == Related pages == * Reign of Terror * Night of the Long Knives * Great Purge * McCarthyism * Cultural Revolution * 2016 Turkish purges Category:Political movements Category:Mass murder",
