 "text": "The Race for Trieste, was a military race to liberate the city of Trieste during the Second world war. == History == The Spring 1945 offensive in Italy began on 6 April 1945, with the New Zealanders participating as part of the British 8th army. One of the objectives was to liberate the city of Trieste and Istria. The Yugoslavs also wanted to liberate the city and Istria so a race began to take Trieste and Istria. On May 1, Yugoslav 9th corps from Yugoslav 4th army occupied Istria and Trieste before the New Zealanders could reach it. The same day, the New Zealanders met the Yugoslavs at Monfalcone, and agreed that the New Zealanders could occupy Trieste with the Yugoslavs together. == Today == Today the whole city of Trieste belongs to Italy while the rest of Istria belongs to Slovenia and Croatia.
