 "text": "The Blackfeet Nation is an American Indian tribe in Montana. They are part of the Great Plains cultural region. The US Government recognizes it as a tribe. The Blackfeet Indian Reservation is next to the Glacier National Park and the Lewis and Clark National Forest. These two areas were originally Blackfeet. The sacred Badger-Two Medicine area is in the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The Blackfeet originally came from the area of the Great Lakes. They later settled the region of Montana in the 17th century. They were nomads. The people eventually got firearms and horses. Americans pushed west and took away land in the 19th century. A treaty of 1896 established a reservation for the Blackfeet. Some sacred area like the Rocky Mountain Front were not included.Renae Ditmer, \"On Eve of Film Premier, Interior Cancels Oil and Gas Leases in Blackfeet ‘Cathedral’\", Indian Country Today, 22 November 2016 == References == Category:Native Americans Category:Montana",
