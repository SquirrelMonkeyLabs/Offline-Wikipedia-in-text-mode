 "text": "There is a vast range of opinions among faiths and religious adherents about human sexuality, ranging from connoting sex and sexuality negatively to considering sex to be the pinnacle of divine expression. When assessing relative morality, several religions make a distinction between human sexual practices that are solely for sexual pleasure and those that are performed for biological reproduction (often only permitted when a person is at a specific age and in a formal marital status). The issue of a \"proper\" role for sexuality has thus been deemed necessary to be addressed by the majority of religions. Different religions have different sexual moral codes that either control sexual behavior or give normative values to specific sexually suggestive behaviors or concepts. Every major religion has created a set of moral principles that address topics like ethics, morality, and human sexuality. These moral standards aim to control the circumstances that may arouse sexual attraction as well as to affect people's sexual behaviors. Category:Religion",
