 "text": "Spirituals (or Negro spirituals) are the songs which were sung by the black slaves in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries. More and more Africans were becoming Christian, so the words to many Negro spirituals have Christian themes. They sung these spirituals as a way to cope with the pain of slavery. Negro spirituals combine traditional West African musical style with the style of Christian hymns from Europe. ==Related pages== *Gospel music Category:African-American history Category:Christian music Category:Folk music Category:Slavery Category:Songs by genre",
