 "text": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computer software to help create, change, analyse or optimize designs. It is meant to help the designer create better quality, more precise, and neater designs. It also helps improve communication of the design by creating documentation for it as well as a database for manufacturing. CAD is used in many places such as architecture and product design. Designing using CAD can take longer than the traditional way of drawing on paper and costs more because of the software. Also, people often need to be trained to understand CAD. == Advantages and disadvantages == Advantages Disadvantages Creates a better design Takes longer to produce the design Creates a more precise design Costs more than doing it by hand Creates a neater design Need to train people to use it ==Types== * 3D Wire-frame modeling * Parametric modeling * Direct or explicit modeling == Examples where CAD is used == *Architecture * Product design * Shop/building design == Related pages == * Computer-aided manufacture (CAM) * CAD/CAM ==References== Category:Software Category:Design",
