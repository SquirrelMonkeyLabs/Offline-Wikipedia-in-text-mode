Clifton East was removed as a ward. It was replaced by a new ward called Clifton Down. Some of the ward was also put in the ward of Clifton. Many students lived in Clifton East. 30% of the population was of ages 20â€“24. The national average in the United Kingdom was 9%. There were many important places in this ward. Some of these were the Clifton Down railway station and Clifton Pool and The Victoria Public House. The ward also had Whiteladies Road. This road had many shops, offices, and houses. In the 1990s, the ABC Cinema on Whiteladies Road was turned into offices and a gymnasium. There were plans, however, to turn it into a cinema. In Clifton East, Clifton Lido was built in 1850. It was closed in 1990, but then reopened in November 2008. Bristol City Council changed the Whiteladies Road in 2011. This changed the traffic of the area. It caused some controversy with local people. ==References== ==Other websites== *Map showing the boundaries of the Clifton East ward. Category:Bristol Category:Wards of the United Kingdom",
