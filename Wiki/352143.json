Higgs: Five decades of noble endeavour BBC News Science and Environmentt, Retrieved 8 October 2013 Higgs was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2013. In the 1960s, he proposed broken symmetry in electroweak theory. This explains the origin of mass of elementary particles in general. It also shows the origin of the W and Z bosons. The theory known as Higgs mechanism was proposed by several physicists at the same time. It proposes the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson. On 4 July 2012, CERN announced they had found a new particle much like the Higgs boson in experiments, but that more work was necessary to analyse its properties and see if it had the properties expected from the Standard Model Higgs boson. The Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics, without which particles would have no mass.Rincon, Paul 2004. Fermilab 'God Particle' may have been seen Retrieved on 2008-05-27 Higgs has received a number of awards. These include the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics, the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics, and the 2010 Sakurai Prize. ==Death== Higgs died after a short illness at home in Edinburgh, Scotland on 8 April 2024, at the age of 94. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh Category:British Nobel Prize winners Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:British theoretical physicists Category:Wolf Prize winners",
