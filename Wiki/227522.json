 "text": "The Seal of the State of Maine was adopted in June 1820. There have been different kinds in the details of the seal, but the overall design and images remain true to the first. The center of the seal is a shield with a tranquil scene of a moose resting in a field bordered by water and woods, pine tree stand tall directly behind the moose. On either side of the shield, a farmer rests on his scythe, and a sailor leans on an anchor. Above the shield is the motto \"Dirigo\" (I lead), and a North Star. Below the shield is a banner that reads \"Maine\". The legislature of 1919 thought that the design of the seal should no longer vary, and the design is still used today.
