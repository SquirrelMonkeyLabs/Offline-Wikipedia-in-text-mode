 "text": "Tanxugueiras is a Spanish girl group formed by Aida Tarrío and the twin sisters Olaia and Sabela Maneiro. They started working together in 2016 and sing mostly in Galician. The name of the group comes from a place name. This is the name of some estates in the parish of Fumaces, in the municipality of Riós and is related to badgers (\"teixugos\" or \"tanxugos\" in Galician). Despite their repertoire they try to give the pieces a modern sound, which brings it closer to the style of world music or even pop. It also seeks to emphasize issues such as women's empowerment. == Career == The Tanxugueiras became well known before they released their first album. In early 2017, a video went viral on social media featuring bakers before a concert with the supergroup A Banda das Crechas in Glasgow. === 2018: Tanxugueiras === In the spring of 2018 they released their first album with the same name as the group, Tanxugueiras. This one won the MIN Prize of Disc in Galician 2018. The presentation single was \"Que non me neguen\", in which they had the collaboration of Guadi Galego. This same year, they released a rock single called \"Critical Culture\" in which they collaborated with NAO and the rap group SonDaRúa. They also collaborated with the Scottish folk group Shooglenifty on the song \"East West\". During their tour they visited stages in various places such as Cuba, India, Switzerland and Scotland. === 2019: Contrapunto === In mid-2019 they were awarded the Martín Códax Music Prize in the category of Galician traditional music and folk. The second album, Contrapunto, was released in November under the Calaverita Records and PlayPlan label. It was produced by Tanxugueiras with the collaboration of Isaac Palacín (from Berrogüetto) who also plays drums. Along with pieces closer to traditional music, such as \"Perfidia\" or \"Miña Nai\", other music such as \"Malquerenza\" or \"Desposorio\" have sounds reminiscent of pop or even electronic music.Interview with Montse Dopico in Praza Pública === 2020-2021: New award and new music === In 2020 they receive the award for the Best Adaptation of a Traditional Piece in the XIX Opinión de Música de Raíz Awards.
