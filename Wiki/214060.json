They are playing in the First League, the second division in Austria's league system. ==History== The club was founded on 7 August 1899 as Athletiksportclub Siegfried, the football section was founded in February 1919. The first match was on 4 May 1919 against Fußballverein Wels . LASK lost 1:4. Being the most successful section of the Athletiksportclub it was decided that the name of the club should be Linzer Athletik-Sport-Klub (Linzer ASK). Till the occupation by Germany in 1938 they reached many titels in the Upper Austrian league. In the 1938/39 season they were promoted to the Gauliga XVII, which was then the highest class in Austrian football. But they were relegated the same season. After the Second World War LASK reached the title in Austrian highest class in the 1964/65 season. The LASK was the first team which came not from Vienna to do so. The same season they also won the Autrian Cup. The next decades were partly successful but also by relegetions to the second division. In 1997, due to public pressure, LASK Linz merged with city rivals FC Linz (formerly known as SK VOEST Linz) which, however, resulted in the cancellation of the latter. Club name, colors, chairmen and members remained the same. In the 2010/11 season they were relegated. 2017 they were promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga again. ==Name== *1908-1996 Linzer ASK *1996-present LASK Linz == Coaching staff == Position Name Date of birth Country with LASK since Last team Head coach Markus Schopp 22.02.1974 09/2024 TSV Hartberg Assistance Maximilian Ritscher 11.01.1994 01/2022 FC Juniors OÖ Assistance Danijel Zenkovic 31.03.1987 07/2024 RB Leipzig U-19 Goalkeeper coach Philip Großalber 12.09.1989 07/2019 SK Vorwärts Steyr LASK: Kader Profis == Current squad == == European cup history == As of December 2008.
