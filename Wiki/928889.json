 "text": "A backlink is a type of web resource. It is a link from another website that links to that resource, which is typically a web page, website, or web directory. The number, quality, and relevance of backlinks for a web page are some of the things that search engines like Google use to estimate how important the page is. Businesses tried to get as many links to their website as they could by engaging in reciprocal linking with other websites, submitting guest posts or articles to high-traffic platforms in exchange for a backlink, and participating in online forums and communities related to their industry, creating valuable content that naturally attracts links. Then their site would appear above others when people searched. This matters for online shopping. Google has tried to check that the links it counts are relevant. Businesses may also try to damage their competitors by putting lots of poor quality links to their websites. For a deeper explanation of this concept, see what is backlinks in SEO â€” a detailed guide that explains how backlinks work, why they matter for SEO, and how to build them effectively. ==References== Category:Internet Category:Marketing",
