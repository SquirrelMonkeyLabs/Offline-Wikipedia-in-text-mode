 "text": "The Young Justice is a fictional DC Comics superhero team of teenaged heroes. ==Establishment== The team was formed in 1998. This was when DC's usual teen hero group, the Teen Titans, had become adults and changed their name to the Titans. Like the original Teen Titans, Young Justice was centered on three teen heroes: Superboy, Robin, and Impulse, but grew to encompass most teenaged heroes in the DC Universe. ==Disestablishment== In the 2003 mini-series Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day, both groups disbanded. Members of each formed two new teams of Teen Titans and Outsiders. ==Revival== The series was revived in 2019 under the Wonder Comics imprint for teen readers, reuniting most of the original core cast.
