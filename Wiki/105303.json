From December 2005 to the 2010 General Election, he was the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland. After the 2010 election, a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition was formed and because the Liberal Democrats have more Scottish MP's than the Conservatives, a Liberal Democrat was given the post of Scottish secretary.

He has three children, one of whom, Oliver Mundell, is a Conservative candidate for the Scottish Parliament in May 2016. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Gay men Category:Members of the British House of Commons for Scottish constituencies Category:British LGBT politicians Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs Category:Scottish LGBT people Category:Secretaries of State for Scotland Category:UK MPs 2005–2010 Category:UK MPs 2010–2015 Category:UK MPs 2015–2017 Category:UK MPs 2017–2019 Category:UK MPs 2019–2024 Category:Politicians from Dumfries and Galloway",
