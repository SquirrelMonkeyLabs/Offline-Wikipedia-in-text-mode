He was best known for his books about the teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh and for many poems. Milne served in both World Wars, joining the British Army in World War I, and was a captain of the British Home Guard in World War II. Milne's son, Christopher Robin, served as the inspiration of the character of the same name in his Winnie-the-Pooh books. Milne retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 which left him paralyzed. Milne died on 31 January 1956, nearly two weeks after his 74th birthday.Jill C. Wheeler (2010). \"A. A.
