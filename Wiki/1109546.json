 "text": "A bearing compass, is a nautical instrument used to determine the bearing of observed objects. (Bearing: angle formed by the north and the visual to a certain object in the sea or ashore). Used in navigation to determine the angle between the direction of an object and the magnetic north or, indirectly, relative to another reference point. Provides the absolute bearing, which is the clockwise angle between magnetic north and the object. For example, an object to the east would have an absolute bearing of 90ยบ, if it is relative to the magnetic north than it is called magnetic bearing.It is commonly used by geologists and surveyors to obtain precise bearings on the earth surface. Sailors use successive demarcations of fixed reference points along with simple geometric techniques to determine their position, course and speed. In addition, making successive demarcations of other vessels, together with simple geometry techniques, can help the navigator to determine if there is a risk of collision and to decide what measures should be taken to avoid the danger. == Description == The simplest and most common type of hand compass has a horizontal compass rose and an observation device: a pinnule, alidade or viewfinder that allows the user to observe the target and then by \"changing view\", read the angle formed by the target direction and the one marked by the compass with respect to the magnetic north. More complex prismatic versions, such as SUUNTO compasses, use an optical system to display the bearinng marks through an ocular while pointing to the target. There are also electronic models of binoculars which, by means of an hybrid electronic- optical system, allow the bearing marks to be viewed digitally at the same time as the object is observed through its optical system. == Related pages == * Compass == References == == Other websites == * historytoday.com Category:Navigation tools",
