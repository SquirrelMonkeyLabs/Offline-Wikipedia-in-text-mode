 "text": "George VI (born Albert Frederick Arthur George Windsor; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was King of the United Kingdom from 11 December 1936 until his death on 6 February 1952. He became king when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson. George was married to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon from April 1923 until his death. A heavy smoker, George died of lung cancer and was given a state funeral. He was 56 years old. He was succeeded as monarch by his elder daughter, Elizabeth. ==Reign== George had a stutter. This made it very difficult for him to carry out many of the public duties of a king which required him to make speeches. He was treated by an Australian speech and language therapist called Lionel Logue. The story of this part of George's life was made into a movie in 2010 called The King's Speech. Colin Firth played the role of George, and Geoffrey Rush played the role of Logue. George became a very popular king throughout the British Empire. He won admiration during World War II (19391945), in which he stayed at Buckingham Palace during the most intense months of the Blitz. The Palace was bombed more than twice but he still remained, becoming a symbol of resistance and \"fighting spirit\". He enjoyed a close working relationship with his wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, inviting him to join the Royal Family on Victory in Europe Day (1945) to celebrate the defeat of the Nazis. In 1939, George VI became the first British reigning monarch to visit the United States. After World War II ended, his health began to decline which meant he could not do many duties as king so Princess Elizabeth took them on in his place. ===British Prime Ministers=== * Stanley Baldwin (1935–1937) * Neville Chamberlain (1937–1940) * Winston Churchill (first term, 1940–1945) * Clement Attlee (1945–1951) * Winston Churchill (second term, 1951–1952) == Family == George VI was the son of King George V and Queen Mary. He was the younger brother of Edward VIII, who gave up the throne to marry an American divorced woman, Wallis Simpson. In April 1923, George married his beloved wife Elizabeth, who later became known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. They had two children, Princesses Elizabeth (later Elizabeth II) (19262022) and Margaret (19302002). == Death and funeral == George VI died on 6 February 1952 from a coronary thrombosis caused by lung cancer. Crowds began to gather in London in the early hours of the morning of the funeral. Thousands saw the event on television. Shortly after 9:00am, the funeral procession arrived at Westminster Hall. More than 300,000 people paid their respects to his body which lay in state for three days. ==Notes== == References == == Other websites == * * * Category:1895 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Cancer deaths in England Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:English Anglicans Category:English royalty Category:House of Windsor Category:People from Norfolk Category:Elizabeth II Category:Deaths from coronary thrombosis Category:Recipients of the Order of the Legion of Honour Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Legion of Honour Category:20th-century British monarchs Category:Monarchs of the United Kingdom Category:Heads of state of Canada",
