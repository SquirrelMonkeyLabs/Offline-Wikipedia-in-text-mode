 "text": "The War of the First Coalition () was a series of wars between 1792 and 1797. The wars were fought between several European countries. They were first fought against the constitutional Kingdom of France and then the French Republic. The other countries did not fight together. There was very little agreement. Each country wanted a different part of France after a French defeat. This defeat never happened. Noah Shusterman – De Franse Revolutie (The French Revolution). Veen Media, Amsterdam, 2015.
