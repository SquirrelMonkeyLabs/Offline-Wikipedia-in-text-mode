 "text": "The Mongol Empire existed in the 13th and the 14th centuries and was one of the largest land empires in history. The original homeland of the Mongols was bounded by the Khingan Mountains to the east, the Altai and the Tian Mountains to the west, the Shilka River and the mountain ranges by Lake Baikal to the north, and the Great Wall of China to the south. It was founded by Genghis Khan in 1206 AD, when he brought together the Mongol and Turkic tribes. When he died in 1227 AD, he had conquered Central Asia, northern China, and parts of eastern Persia. Later, his grandson Kublai Khan went on to expand the empire and found the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty, which ruled over all of China. The Mongol Empire stretched from Eastern Europe to East Asia, including Central Asia and the Middle East. Its power did not last long since by the 1360s, it had broken into several empires, all of which were later destroyed. One of Shi Tianze's sons married a daughter of the Mongol official Menggu Baer (Meng-ku Pa-erh), according to an epitaph that Hu Zhiyu wrote. The son is mentioned as having served as Minister of the Right. Shi Jiang (Shih Chiang) and Shi Ge (Shih Ko) among the eight sons of Shi Tianze were Minister of the Right and could be either one of them. Shi Tianze, who was Han himself had two Jurchen wives, one Korean wife and one Han wife. The National History Project of the Mongol Empire under Kublai Khan was supervised and directed by Shi Tianze, who was the Chancellor of the Left, and was recommended by Wang E (Wang O) in August 1261 after the National History Academy and the Hanlin Academy were recreatd. Menggu Baer served as an official in China and was known for his leniency and kindness towards commoners. ==References== == Other websites == * Genghis Khan and the Mongols * The Mongol Empire * Mongols * Genghis Khan Biography * The Mongols in World History * The Mongol Empire for students Category:History of Mongolia Category:1206 establishments Category:1360s disestablishments Category:1200s establishments in Asia Category:14th-century disestablishments in Asia Category:History of Europe Category:Empires in Asia Category:Empires in Europe",
