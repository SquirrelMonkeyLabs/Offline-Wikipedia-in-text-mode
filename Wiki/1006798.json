The renovations were completed in 1940, and in 1942, it was promoted to Kokuhei Shosha. However, after the end of World War II, the shrine was closed down. The shrine office and the approach to the shrine are the only remaining structures at the site. The former shrine grounds have been repurposed to house a facility for refugees and stowaways from China, known as Hsinchu Yasuro. The shrine office has been converted to a management facility for this purpose. The site has been designated as a municipal historic site in Hsinchu City.新竹神社殘蹟及其附屬建築 文化部文化資産局 国家文化資産網 == References == == Other websites == * Hsinchu Shrine (Hsinchu City Hall/English) Category:Kokuhei Shōsha Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Shinto shrines in the Japanese colonial empire",
