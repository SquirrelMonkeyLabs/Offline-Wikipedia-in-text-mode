 "text": "A DIP switch (standing for dual in-line package switch) is a small electric switch, packaged in a dual in-line package as though it were an integrated circuit. It typically has several switches, with each one connection between two opposite pins on the package. One side of the switch is usually marked to be the \"ON\" side, so that it is clear which way the switches need to be moved to complete the circuit. Category:Electronic switches",
