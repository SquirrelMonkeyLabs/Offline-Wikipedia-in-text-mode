 "text": "The common rocket frog (Colostethus inguinalis) is a frog. It lives in Colombia and Panama. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives next to streams in forests, especially rocky places next to streams. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 400 meters above sea level. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to streams where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. This frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. People cut down trees get wood to build with, to make farms, and to make farms that are against the law. Bad chemicals from those farms can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
