In Yaacov Ro'i, Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union. London: Frank Cass. , pp. 103–6. * * * * * * * * * ==Overview== The word rootless cosmopolitan was common in Soviet propaganda when the \"anti-cosmopolitan campaign\" took place between 1948 and 1953, a few years after the end of the Holocaust, which killed over 6,000,000 Jews (67% of pre-war European Jews). * * * * * * * * * * * The \"anti-cosmopolitan campaign\" was antisemitic. It is believed to have started off with Joseph Stalin's accusation of several writers having \"bourgeois Western influences\" in 1946, * * * * * * * which peaked in the Doctors' Plot in 1953 when Stalin falsely accused Jewish doctors of planning to poison the Soviet leaders based on a medieval antisemitic trope. Antisemitic purges and executions were carried out across the USSR and her satellite states. These came at a time of tension between the newly founded State of Israel and the USSR, when Israel began allying with the United States (US). ==Origin== The word was created by Russian writer Vissarion Belinsky (1811 ‒ 1848) to refer to those seen by him as lacking Russian national character. ==Usage== As per historian Cathy S. Gelbin, at p.865. As per literature professor Margarita Levantovskaya, ==Antisemitism in the Soviet Union== ===1960s=== ====Persecution of Jews==== The persecution of Jews in the USSR intensified under Leonid Brezhnev's rule when Israel defeated the Soviet-armed Arab League in the 1967 Six-Day War. Antisemitic propaganda in the form of \"anti-Zionist\" broadcasting appeared, such as the film Secret and Explicit, which demonized Jews as a malign Zionist cabal based on themes from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Many of Brezhnev's close advisors, especially Mikhail Suslov, were radical antisemites. Jewish emigration to Israel or the United States (US) was heavily restricted,Joseph Dunner.

Written permission from all close family members was also required, with a low application approval rate. Systemic racism against Jews was widespread, which caught little attention from Western academic leftists. * Lappin, Shalom (2006), ‘How Class Disappeared from Western Politics’, Dissent, Vol. 51, No. 1, pp. 73-78. * * * * Kirsch, Adam (2024), On Settler Colonialism: Ideology, Violence, and Justice, W.W. Norton and Company, New York and London. * Boris Kochubievsky, a Ukrainian-Jewish radio engineer, wrote Brezhnev a letter: Shortly after, Kochubievsky was kidnapped by the KGB into a mental asylum. Almost all Soviet Jews were reportedly affected by the post-1967 wave of antisemitism, despite common leftist indifference. In 1969, Soviet propagandist Yuri Ivanov condemned Zionism as a \"capitalist imperialist\" idea:Caution: Zionism! Essays on the Ideology, Organisation and Practice of Zionism ====Denialism==== Just as academically influential Western \"anti-Zionists\", the Soviets denied that their \"anti-Zionism\" was antisemitic by alleging that many of their \"anti-Zionist\" officials were Jewish. In the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, the World Zionist Organization (WZO) was also accused of \"controlling Western media\" and \"participating in colonialism\" worldwide.Source: Большая советская энциклопедия / Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition. 1969–1978; translation. The third edition of the thirty-volume Great Soviet Encyclopedia (Большая Советская энциклопедия, БСЭ) claims the following: * \"The main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti-Communism and anti-Sovietism\" * \"The anti-human reactionary essence of Zionism\" is \"overt and covert fight against freedom movements and against the USSR\" * \"International Zionist Organization owns major financial funds, partly through Jewish monopolists and partly collected by Jewish mandatory charities\", it also \"influences or controls significant part of media agencies and outlets in the West\" * \"Serving as the front squad of colonialism and neo-colonialism, international Zionism actively participates in the fight against national liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America\" * \"A natural and objective assimilation process of Jews is growing around the world.\" In his book A History of the Jews in the Modern World, American historian Howard Sachar stated that Soviet \"anti-Zionism\" was not much different from Nazism:Howard Sachar, A History of the Jews in the Modern World (New York: Knopf, 2005) p.722 ===1980s=== The persecution did not fade until the 1980s, when Brezhnev reportedly changed course in 1981 by indirectly disapproving of antisemitism at a Communist Party meeting. * \"The CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] has fought and will always fight resolutely against such phenomena [inter-ethnic tensions] which are alien to the nature of socialism as chauvinism or nationalism, against any nationalistic aberrations such as, let us say, anti-Semitism or Zionism. We are against tendencies aimed at artificial erosion of national characteristics [. ...] the sacred duty of the party [is] to educate the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and socialist internationalism, of a proud feeling of belonging to a single great Soviet motherland.\" * * Despite Brezhnev's reported disapproval of antisemitism, antisemitic propaganda remained widespread in the USSR. Sometimes, those antisemitic propaganda promoted the false claim of \"active WWII Nazi‒Zionist collaboration\". * * * * * * * * * * * The false claim is still commonly exploited by antisemites on the far right and far left to trivialize the Holocaust and demonize the vast majority of diaspora Jews who support Israel's right to exist. Pravda, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, ran an \"anti-Zionist\" front-page article on April 1, 1983, * * * * * * whose viewpoints are still widely shared by academically influential Western \"anti-Zionists\": ===Aftermath=== It is estimated that about 2,750,000 Soviet Jews left the USSR between May 9, 1945 and December 26, 1991, with most departing after 1989 when exit control was relaxed. Soviet antisemitism's influence extended far beyond USSR's borders. Notably, it has left a long-lasting mark on American society. Famous pro-Soviet Black nationalists, especially Malcolm X (1925 – 1965), adopted the Soviet antisemitic tropes and mainstreamed them via circulation among academia and Black Americans, * * * * * from whom the influential antisemitic groups Nation of Islam (NOI) * * * * * * * and Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) drew massive support. Particularly, NOI's leader Louis Farrakhan was classified by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as the most popular antisemite in America. In American society, Soviet antisemitic tropes were normalized over the decades and engendered a form of new antisemitism, * * * * * where Jews are accused of being the \"beneficiaries\" of \"White privilege\" and \"embodiment of evil\" allegedly coordinating Western governments to \"support Israel at the expense of Palestinians\". * * * * * As per a 2016 survey by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 23% Black Americans held negative beliefs about Jews, while a 2023 survey reportedly showed that one-eighth of Black Americans doubted whether the Holocaust really happened. ===Academic views=== ====Carol Apollonio==== Carol Apollonio, Professor of the Practice of Slavic and Eurasian Studies at Duke University, and president of the North American Dostoevsky Society, commented on the word: ====David Hirsh==== David Hirsh (1967 – ), a British historian, shared similar views: ====Eliot Borenstein==== Eliot Borenstein, Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at New York University, commented on the word: ====Walter Laqueur==== Walter Laqueur (1921 – 2018), a German-American historian, summarized his research on Soviet \"anti-Zionism\": ==Related pages== * Racism * Antiziganism * Antisemitism in Europe * Roman Catholics and antisemitism in the 21st century ==References== Category:Slurs Category:Russia Category:Racism Category:Cold War Category:Communism Category:Soviet Union Category:Antisemitism Category:Joseph Stalin Category:Discrimination Category:History of Russia Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:History of the Soviet Union",
