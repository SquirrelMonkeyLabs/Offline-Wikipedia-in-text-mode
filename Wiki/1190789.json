 "text": "Charles Churchill (1759â€“1790) was the master at arms on board HMAV Bounty during Lieutenant William Bligh's voyage to Tahiti to transplant breadfruit to the British colonies in the West Indies. During a mutiny on the ship, Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian seized command of the ship from Bligh on 28 April 1789. Churchill was an active member of the mutiny, being a member of Fletcher Christian's loyalists that arrested Bligh in his cabin. Churchill was born in Manchester in 1759. Little else is recorded of his early life in England. Between August and the October of 1787, Bountys crew was being assigned for the voyage to Tahiti. On 7 September 1787, Churchill signed on as the ships corporal, a task including the assistance of maintaining the order amongst the crew. Returning to Tahiti, he participated in the warfare between the native tribes and was made a tribal chief himself. This caused friction between Churchill and fellow mutineer Matthew Thompson, who envied his onetime crony's status. One day in 1790 Thompson accused Churchill of stealing weapons from him. When Churchill denied it, Thompson shot him to death. He was the first Bounty mutineer to die. == References == Category:HMS Bounty mutineers Category:1759 births Category:1790 deaths Category:18th-century pirates Category:English pirates",
