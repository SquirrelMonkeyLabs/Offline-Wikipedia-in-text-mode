It previously held the status of village until December 31, 1954 and again at an unknown date but was restructured back to hamlet status on December 28, 1978. The town used to have a bank, a school and a grain elevator. Now, no businesses are left. Even the post office closed. The grain elevator was burned down by its owner. Except for a few people who still live there, it is a now ghost town. == References == Category:Settlements in Saskatchewan Category:Ghost towns in Canada Category:Hamlets",
