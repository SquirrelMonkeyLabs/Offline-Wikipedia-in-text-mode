 "text": "Jacob Leon \"Jack\" Rubenstein (March 25, 1911 - January 3, 1967) was an American criminal. Ruby was born on March 25, 1911 in Chicago, Illinois. On November 24, 1963, Ruby fatally shot Lee Harvey Oswald, who was in police custody after being charged with assassinating U.S. President John F. Kennedy two days earlier. Ruby was convicted of murdering Oswald, but the conviction was overturned. He continued to be held in prison while awaiting retrial. The retrial did not happen because he died on January 3, 1967 at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Texas from lung cancer and a pulmonary embolism, aged 55. Ruby is buried in Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois. ==References== ==Other websites== * In Defense of Jack Ruby * Jack Ruby: Dallas' Original J.R.
