 "text": "Absalom is a biblical name that means \"father of peace\" or \"my father is peace\" in Hebrew. It has been used for centuries despite its association with a tragic figure in the Bible, Absalom, who rebelled against his father, King David. However, the name itself has a positive meaning as it combines two Hebrew words, \"ab\" and \"shalom,\" meaning \"father\" and \"peace\" respectively. == People == * Absalom Boston (1785–1855), American businessman and captain * Absalom Harris Chappell (1801–1878), American politician and lawyer * Absalom Dlamini (born 1984), Swazi footballer ==References== Category:Names",
