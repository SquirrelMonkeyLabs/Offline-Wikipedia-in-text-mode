 "text": "\"Angel of Death\" is a song by American thrash metal band Slayer. It is the opening song to their third studio album, Reign in Blood. The song was released on October 7, 1986. The song is based on Nazi physician Josef Mengele who worked at the Auschwitz concentration camp and did human experiments. Both the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Stylus Magazine's Clay Jarvas said that the song \"smokes the asses of any band playing fast and/or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the horrors to come, while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record: fast, lean and filthy.\" \"Angel of Death\" caused controversy and led to accusations that Slayer were Nazi sympathizers. Hanneman said about the controversy: \"I know why people misinterpret it – it's because they get this knee–jerk reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me – well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1986 songs Category:Slayer songs",
