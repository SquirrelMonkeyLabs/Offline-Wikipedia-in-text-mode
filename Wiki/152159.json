They were combined (made into one) on May 12, 1841. According to Pierre de Marca, a famous historian, the name Ogenne can be traced back to the 11th century. It was first called Ogene in the 11th century, then Oiena in the 13th century. In around 1350 it was called Sent- Jacme d'Ojenne, and in 1385 it was called Oyene. Finally in 1548 it was called Ogena. The name Camptort comes from the 13th century. It was first called Campus tortus in 1235. It was called some other names: Cam-tort (1385), Quamptort (1540), Sanctus Stephanus de Camptort (1674), Cantor (1755), and Camptor (1793.) Two streams run through the town. One stream is the Saley, a tributary of the Gave d'Oloron (a river). The other stream is the Laà, a tributary of the Gave de Pau (also a river.) Ogenne-Camptort",
