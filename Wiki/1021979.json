Scientists are not sure where it lives. They believe it lives in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Mount Shiwanda in Guanxi Province, 937 meters above sea level. ==Home== This frog lives near plants next to streams and ponds. It lives in forests that have not been cut down, in forests that have had some trees cut down, and in villages where human beings live. People have seen this frog between 50 and 1000 meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks, for example Khao Kitchakut National Park and Sakaerat Environmental Research Station. ==Young== The male frogs sit on plants that hang over the water and calls to the female frogs. Sometimes the male frogs hang under the plants. The female frog lays eggs on rocks and plants near water. She lays about 230 eggs at a time. The female frog stays near the eggs after she lays them. Scientists have seen female frogs jump on grasshoppers that come to eat the eggs. The eggs take 4-6 days to hatch. The tadpoles fall into the water. The tadpoles can hatch out of their eggs early if there is a flood. If there is a flood, eggs that do not hatch early die. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger. Human beings cut down trees to make farms and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
