 "text": "The Kickapoo People (Kickapoo: Kiikaapoa or Kiikaapoi) are an Algonquian- speaking Native American and Indigenous Mexican tribe. Anishinaabeg say the name \"Kickapoo\" (Giiwigaabaw in the Anishinaabe language and its Kickapoo cognate Kiwikapawa) means \"Stands here and there.\" This may have referred to the tribe often moving around. The name can also mean \"wanderer\". There are three federally recognized Kickapoo tribes in the United States: Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas, the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas. The Oklahoma and Texas bands are politically linked with each other. The Kickapoo in Kansas came from them being moved from southern Missouri in 1832 as a land exchange from their reservation there. Around 3,000 people are tribal members. ==References== ==Other websites== * Kickapoo Tribe of Kansas, official website * Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, official website * Kickapoo language, alphabet and pronunciation * Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas , official website * Matthew R.
