 "text": "On July 7, 2017, an Airbus A320-211 was nearly in an accident at San Francisco International Airport in San Mateo County, California, United States. The flight came from Toronto Pearson international Airport and was about to land but instead of lining up with the runway, the plane had lined up with the taxiway. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the possible cause was the Air Canada flight crew's confusion of the runway with the taxiway, with causes such as the crew not using the instrument landing system (ILS) and pilot fatigue. A retired pilot stated the runway confusion that almost happened \"probably came close to the greatest aviation disaster in history\" as five airplanes and potentially over 1,000 passengers were at imminent risk of a disaster greater than the Tenerife airport disaster. == References == Category:2017 in California Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error",
