 "text": "The FIFA Puskás Award is an association football award that is organized by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). The award was created in 2009, in order to award the male or female judged to have scored the most aesthetically significant, or \"most beautiful\", goal of a year. The Puskás award is announced yearly and is decided by voting. The award is named after former Real Madrid striker Ferenc Puskás. Puskás played during the 1950s and 1960s, and was part of the Hungarian \"golden team\". The voting was done by fans of the sport until 2018 on FIFA's official website. This was changed after a controversy with the 2018 edition of the award, and is now decided by pundits selected by FIFA. ==Award criteria== *It should be an \"absolutely beautiful goal\" (subjective, but decided by voting and judgement from experts — the spread of goals should include long-range shots, team goals, rabona, overhead kicks, individual plays, scorpion kicks, etc.). * It should be awarded \"without distinction of championship, gender or nationality\". * It should not be the result of luck, mistakes, deflection by another player or the player in an offside position. * It should support fair play, i.e. the player should not have behaved badly in the game or have been charged with doping, for example. * The player cannot be nominated with two different goals. ==Winners== Year Rank Player Team Scored For Team Scored Against Vote Percentage 2009 1st Cristiano Ronaldo Manchester United Porto 17.68% 2nd Andrés Iniesta Barcelona Chelsea 15.64% 3rd Grafite VfL Wolfsburg Bayern Munich 13.39% 2010 1st Hamit Altıntop 40.55% 2nd Linus Hallenius Hammarby IF Syrianska FC 13.23% 3rd Giovanni van Bronckhorst 10.61% 2011 1st Neymar Santos Flamengo N/A 2nd Lionel Messi Barcelona Arsenal 3rd Wayne Rooney Manchester United Manchester City 2012 1st Miroslav Stoch Fenerbahçe Gençlerbirliği 78% 2nd Radamel Falcao Atlético Madrid América de Cali 15% 3rd Neymar Santos Internacional 7% 2013 1st Zlatan Ibrahimović 48.7% 2nd Nemanja Matić Benfica Porto 30.8% 3rd Neymar 20.5% 2014 1st James Rodríguez 42% 2nd Stephanie Roche Peamount United Wexford Youths 33% 3rd Robin van Persie 11% 2015 1st Wendell Lira Goianésia Atlético Goianiense 46.7% 2nd Lionel Messi Barcelona Athletic Bilbao 33.3% 3rd Alessandro Florenzi Roma Barcelona 7.1% 2016 1st Mohd Faiz Subri Penang Pahang 59.46% 2nd Marlone Corinthians Cobresal 22.86% 3rd Daniuska Rodríguez 10.01% 2017 1st Olivier Giroud Arsenal Crystal Palace 36.17% 2nd Oscarine Masuluke Baroka Orlando Pirates 27.48% 3rd Deyna Castellanos 20.47% 2018 1st Mohamed Salah Liverpool Everton 38% 2nd Cristiano Ronaldo Real Madrid Juventus 22% 3rd Giorgian de Arrascaeta Cruzeiro América Mineiro 17% 2019 1st Dániel Zsóri Debrecen Ferencváros N/A 2nd Lionel Messi Barcelona Real Betis 3rd Juan Fernando Quintero River Plate Racing Club 2020 1st Son Heung-min Tottenham Hotspur Burnley N/A 2nd Giorgian de Arrascaeta Flamengo Ceará 3rd Luis Suárez Barcelona Mallorca 2021 1st Erik Lamela Tottenham Hotspur Arsenal N/A 2nd Mehdi Taremi Porto Chelsea 3rd Patrik Schick 2022 1st Marcin Oleksy Warta Poznań Stal Rzeszów N/A 2nd Dimitri Payet Marseille PAOK 3rd Richarlison 2023 1st Guilherme Madruga Botafogo-SP Novorizontino N/A 2nd Nuno Santos Sporting CP Boavista 3rd Julio Enciso Brighton & Hove Albion Manchester City 2024 1st Alejandro Garnacho Manchester United Everton N/A 2nd Yassine Benzia 3rd Denis Omedi Kitara KCCA == Awards won by nationality == Country Wins Years 2011, 2015, 2023 2021, 2024 2009 2010 2012 2013 2014 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2022 ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Sports trophies and awards Category:FIFA",
