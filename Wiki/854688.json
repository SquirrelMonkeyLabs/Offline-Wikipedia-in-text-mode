 "text": "A systematic review indicates that children having COVID-19 have milder effects and better outcomes than many adults. Children, however, are more likely to have multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a rare though life-threatening illness. This condition involves persistent fevers and extreme inflammation after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, a virus that causes COVID-19. Children and adolescents may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in several other areas. Those are education, socioeconomic status and mental health. When children and adolescents are infected with COVID-19, they are more likely to not show symptoms or usually have mild to moderate severity. Children and adolescents are not as likely to go to a hospital as adults. Some children, however, develop severe illness. In these cases respiratory support, like a ventilator, may be needed. Children and adolescents are far less likely to die than people under other age groups. ==Impact on most at-risk groups== The safety for children and adolescents is under risk while the COVID-19 pandemic is happening. Children and teenagers living in substandard or crowded conditions are particularly under risk. Youth – in particular young women, people under certain racial backgrounds and migrants – face higher than normal socioeconomic and health impacts. They are also under increased risks of gender-based violence due to social isolation, discrimination and major financial stress. ==References== Category:COVID-19 pandemic Category:Childhood",
