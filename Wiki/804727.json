 "text": "Hypogamy is marrying someone considered to be of lower economic or social class or caste. Hypogamy has been found to be practiced more by men than by women. For men power and control is the one of the strongest attainments and what often leads them to pursue a hypogamous relationship. The idea of power and control is made possible by the gender roles and expectations that society has instilled in both men and women. Societal institutions have created deeply rooted systematic differences between men and women and an idea of how far women can go socially, professionally, and economically. Immigration and citizenship have influenced the goal of marriage, consequentially creating hypogamy on the personal level. == References == Category:Sociology",
