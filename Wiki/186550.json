 "text": "Ashkenazi Jews, or Ashkenazim (-im is a Hebrew plural suffix), are a group of Jews who, following the involuntary displacement from JudeaLater renamed by the Romans as Syria Palaestina (etymological origin of Palestine) following their crackdown on the Bar Kokhba revolt in AD 135 that killed 1,100,000 Jews in c. AD 70, lived in Central and Eastern Europe. ==Name== In Hebrew and Yiddish, Ashkenaz means German. ==History== ===Classical antiquity=== It is believed that after the Jews were expelled from the Land of Israel (Hebrew: אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל, pronunciation: ʼÉreṣ Yiśrāʼēl / Eretz Yisrael) by the Romans, they were abducted to Italy as slaves, while some believe that they went there for trade. * * * * * * * * ===Middle Ages=== After a few centuries, a founding group emigrated into Central and then later Eastern Europe and Russia where a genetic bottleneck occurred, and most Ashkenazim can consider themselves the descendants of these few founding members. Due to pogroms in the Middle Ages, mainly in Germany, many Jews fled to Poland and Lithuania, and from there they spread over the rest of Eastern Europe. They then adopted the Yiddish language. ===Modern period=== In the 17th century, avoiding persecution, many Jews moved to and settled in Western Europe. After that, two terms, Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, became commonly used: The former indicates the Jews who worshiped in the German way and spoke Yiddish, the latter indicates the Jews who worshiped in the Spanish way and spoke the Ladino language. They differ in language, cultural tradition and worship style, yet both are closely related in terms of genetics. ===20th century=== During World War II, at least 271,000 Jews, some of whom were Ashkenazim, were killed in the Holocaust. The Holocaust destroyed the once large Jewish communities and the Yiddish language in Europe. Many of the surviving Ashkenazi Jews emigrated to countries such as Israel, Canada, Argentina, Australia and the United States after the war. As of 2018, Ashkenazim are around 75% of the 14.6 million Jews of the world. They are also the mainstream of Israeli politics. Famous Ashkenazim include Albert Einstein, George Gershwin, Gustav Mahler and Franz Kafka. ==Related pages== * Antisemitism * Mizrahi Jews * Sephardi Jews * Maghrebi Jews * Catholic Church and the Independent State of Croatia * Roman Catholics and antisemitism in the 21st century ==References== * Category:Judaism Category:Jewish history Category:Eastern Europe * Category:Yiddish language Category:History of Europe Category:History of Germany Category:Jewish communities Category:Jewish ethnic groups Category:Ethnic groups in Europe Category:Ethnic groups in Germany",
