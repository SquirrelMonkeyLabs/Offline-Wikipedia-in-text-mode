 "text": "Epiktetos was an ancient Greek potter and vase painter. His name means \"newly acquired\". He may have been a slave, as were most potters and painters in ancient Greece. He worked mostly with cups and plates between 520 and 490 BC in the red-figure style. He signed more than half his works. He was an expert with the tondothe circular picture at the bottom of a cup. He painted mostly everyday scenes rather than mythological ones. His end is unknown. == Related pages == * Youth Riding a Rooster (Epiktetos) == Other websites == * Category:Ancient Greek painters Category:Potters Category:6th-century BC deaths Category:5th-century BC births Category:5th century BC in art Category:6th century BC in art",
