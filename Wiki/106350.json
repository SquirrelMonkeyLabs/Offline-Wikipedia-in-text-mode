(sometimes also called pictogramme or pictogram) is a small drawing. Today, pictograms are used very often. Because they are independent of the language, they are often used where there are people who need to understand things, even if they do not read or speak the language. Pictograms are also often used where it is important to understand something fast. Sight is faster than reading. That way, pictograms are often used for signalling in emergency situations, such as showing emergency exits. Common uses include those for road signs, airports, and train station, and warning signs. ==Examples== Image:Toilet women.svg|Female toilet Image:Hazard T.svg|Poisons are usually marked like this.
