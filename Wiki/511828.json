It stars Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez, Jim Cummings, Frank Welker, Armand Assante, Edward James Olmos and Tobin Bell. It was composed by Elton John. The movie follows two Spanish conmen who leave Spain and set off to the New World. As they head to the legendary city of gold, they are mistaken for gods by the people. The movie flopped at the box office. It was poorly received by critics. ==Plot== In 16th century Spain, two con artists win a map to El Dorado from the dice game. They escape from the city and stow away on the ship of Hernán Cortés, while sailing to the New World. After befriending a horse named Altivo, they land off the Mexican coast. After seeing landmarks on the map, they take a direction to the legendary golden city. As they arrive at the waterfall, a woman and an army of guards recognize them as gods, and escort them to the city. There, they meet the elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok and the malicious high priest Tzekel Kan. Tannabok welcomes the two to the city warmly, while Tzekel Kan mainly sees them as an opportunity to enhance his own standing. He also believes the gods' arrival will spark the \"Year of the Jaguar\", a time when everyone will be purged from the city. ==Voice cast== * Joe Alaskey as Sylvester the Cat and Tweety * Kevin Kline as Tulio * Kenneth Branagh as Miguel * Chris Wedge as Scrat * Tara Strong as Roshan *Alan Tudyk as Dab the Dodo * Vincent Cassel as Monsieur Hood * Frank Welker as Goddard (uncredited) * Jeffrey Garcia as Sheen Estevez * Carolyn Lawrence as Cindy Vortex and Tina Sue * Crystal Scales as Libby Folfax and Ike * Andrea Martin as Ms. Winfred Fowl * Candi Milo as Nick Dean * Rob Paulsen as Butch and Principal Willoughby * Billy West as Sam * Tobin Bell as Zaragoza * Mark DeCarlo as Stavos * Jim Cummings as Toy Factory Boss * Jeff Bennett as an unemployment lady * Grey DeLisle as Greystar Lead * Elton John as the Narrator ===Additional voices=== * Bruce Adler as Tzekel-Kan's Guards * Jack Angel as Cortés's Soldiers * Bob Bergen as Jaguar, Cortés's Soldiers * Rodger Bumpass as Cortés's Soldiers * Corey Burton as Cortés's Soldiers * Philip L.
