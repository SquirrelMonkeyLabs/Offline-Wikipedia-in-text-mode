 "text": "Kidney stone disease, also known as nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, is when a solid piece of material (kidney stones, also known as renal calculi) forms in the kidney or bladder. From there, most travel down the urinary tract. Kidney stones typically form in the kidney and leave the body during urination. A small stone may pass without causing symptoms (90% or more) within 3 months. Kidney and bladder stones have been known to be fatal. A US founding father, Benjamin Franklin, had kidney stones. If a stone grows to more than it can cause blockage of the ureter resulting in severe pain in the lower back or abdomen. A kidney stone 1cm or larger cannot pass on its own and requires surgery. The medical name for kidney stone pain is renal colic. A stone may also result in blood in the urine, vomiting, or painful urination. About 50% of people who get kidney stones will have another within 5 years, especially if they are under the age of 25. ==References== Category:Urinary problems Category:Kidney diseases Category:Nephrology",
