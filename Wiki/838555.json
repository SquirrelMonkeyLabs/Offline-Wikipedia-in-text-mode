 "text": "The Allegorical feminine figures of Imperial Palace of Russia are paintings on canvas by Giambattista Pittoni, made between 1762 and 1767 and exhibited on the ceilings of the \"Chinese Palace\" in the Royal Palace Oranienbaum residence of the Romanov Emperors, in Lomonosov, near St Petersburg, Russia.Pittoni, Franca Zava Boccazzi, 1974, ed. Afieri, p. 148 == Description == The ceiling is decorated with two allegorical figures painted on canvas and applied to decorate the halls of the Palace built by Catherine the Great of Russia, between 1762 and 1768, she commissioning the artworks to the most important Master of the Venetian Academy Giambattista Pittoni. The theme of female allegories was commissioned personally from by Catherine II, where the two figures recall Perseverance, who holds a snake in her right hand, and Magnificence, who holds an ovate in her left hand. The figure of the Magnificence stylistically recalls the \"Allegory of Music\" of Villa Pisani (Venice). A model with \"Allegory\" in Palace Villa Widmann Foscari in Venice recalls this work whose figure was studied by Pittoni in a drawing of the Villa Widmann of the Gallerie dell'Accademia. == Related pages == * Catherine the Great * Giambattista Pittoni * Oranienbaum, Russia == References == == Bibliography == * F.
