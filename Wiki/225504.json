 "text": "In astrodynamics, a hyperbolic trajectory (which is also an escape trajectory) refers to an object (such as an asteroid) which follows a path similar to a hyperbola around a central object. This motion follows Kepler's Laws. A hyperbolic trajectory occurs when the eccentricity of its orbit is greater than 1. Other types of motion in astronomy include circular orbit, elliptical orbit, and parabolic trajectory. Category:Orbits",
