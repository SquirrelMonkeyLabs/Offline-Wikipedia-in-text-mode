Williams helped start the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL). == Inspiration == Many things made her become a peace activist. One of these things was her brother. Her brother was deaf and schizophrenic. He was disliked for his disabilities. In college, Williams didn't know what she wanted to study. After she graduated, she worked as a teacher in the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Washington D.C. Williams does not like landmines. She does not want innocent people to be hurt by the landmines. Some people would accidentally step on the landmines and be killed. == Work With Celebrities == Williams worked with celebrities to help teach people about the danger of landmines. She even worked with was Diana, Princess of Wales. Some celebrities didn't like this activism. One celebrity that didn't like Williams’ activism was Bill Clinton, a former US president. Clinton made this clear when he did not call her when she got the Nobel Peace Prize. == Achievements == Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was given the Nobel Peace Prize because of her work on getting rid of landmines. The Nobel Peace Prize was given to her in October, a day after her birthday. Williams said that it was challenging for her to get support on this project. The government didn't want to give landmines up because they were cheap and worked well. Williams won the argument and had landmines were made illegal. Williams worked for many organizations. She worked with Nicaragua-Honduras Education Project, the Medical Aid for El Salvador, Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, and Medico International. Williams wrote Banning Landmines: Disarmament, Citizen Diplomacy, and Human Security and My Name is Jody Williams: A Vermont Girl's Winding Path to the Nobel Peace Prize.
