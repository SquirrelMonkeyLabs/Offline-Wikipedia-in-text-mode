 "text": "In mathematics, the identity element (or neutral element) of a set is a special element of that set. It is special because if it is combined with another element of that set, it does not change the other element. With addition, the identity element is 0, because adding 0 to some number does not change the number. With multiplication, it is 1. In a group (an algebraic structure in mathematics), the identity element is sometimes denoted by the symbol e. ==Further Examples== set operation identity real numbers + (addition) 0 real numbers • (multiplication) 1 real numbers ab (exponentiation) 1 (right identity only) m-by-n matrices + (addition) zero matrix n-by-n square matrices • (multiplication) identity matrix all functions from a set M to itself ∘ (function composition) identity map character strings, lists concatenation empty string, empty list extended real numbers minimum/infimum +∞ extended real numbers maximum/supremum -∞ subsets of a set M ∩ (intersection) M sets ∪ (union) {} (empty set) boolean logic ∧ (logical and) ⊤ (truth) boolean logic ∨ (logical or) ⊥ (falsity) only two elements {e, f} * defined by e * e = f * e = e and f * f = e * f = f both e and f are left identities, but there is no right or two-sided identity == Related pages == * Identity (mathematics) * Null vector * One * Zero == References == Category:Algebra Category:Abstract algebra",
