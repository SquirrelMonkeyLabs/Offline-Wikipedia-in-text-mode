 "text": "Urolagnia (also urophilia, undinism) is when people gain sexual pleasure from urine and/or urination. The term has origins in the Greek Language (from ouron, urine, and lagneia, lust). Those who enjoy urolagnia may enjoy urinating on other people, or being urinated on. The practice of drinking the urine is called urophagia. People who practice urolagnia may play in a domination and submission scene. These activities are often described with the slang terms golden showers, water sports, or piss play. Uncontrollable bladder desperation or panty wetting is socially a different matter. In New Zealand, publishing anything promoting or supporting urolagnia, whether in print or online, is an offence punishable by up to ten years in prison. Probably that law is rarely used. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Paraphilias Category:Sexual acts",
