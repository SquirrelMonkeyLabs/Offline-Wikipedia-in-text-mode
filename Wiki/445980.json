It was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The tax was abolished by the Chinese Immigration Act of 19. That act stopped all Chinese immigration excep business people, clergy, educators, student, and other categories. Category:Taxation in Canada Category:19th century in Canada Category:Migration laws",
