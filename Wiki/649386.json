 "text": "The Cleveland Torso Murderer (also known as the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run) was an unidentified serial killer. It was active in Cleveland, Ohio, USA in the 1930s. The killings were defined by the cut-off pieces of twelve known victims and the disposal of their remains in the poor neighborhood of Kingsbury Run. The official number of murders caused by the Cleveland Torso Murderer is thirteen, although recent research has shown there could have been as many as twenty. The twelve known victims were killed between 1935 and 1938. Most victims had their heads cut off, and sometimes other limbs were cut off as well. In some cases, the men were castrated too. Most of the victims were homeless or sex workers. ==References== Category:1935 in the United States Category:20th century in Cleveland Category:American serial killers Category:Unidentified serial killers",
