 "text": "Big Five are the United States's major movie production studios which also distribute their product. All of them have historic flagship production facilities near Hollywood. All Big Five major studios (Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures) are parts of much larger business enterprises, with their corporate headquarters offices far from Hollywood. The group of major studios long numbered seven, but was reduced to six with the fading from importance of MGM in the 1980s. They became five when, on November 6, 2017 - Disney announced its deal to buy Fox for $52.4 billion. == Majors == === Current === Studio parent (conglomerate) Major film studio unit \\----Second studio Date Found Arthouse/indie Genre movie/B movie Animation Other divisions and brands OTT/VOD US/CA market share (2023) Universal Studios (NBCUniversal, Comcast) Universal Pictures April 30, 1912 Focus Features Working Title Films Universal Animation Studios DreamWorks Animation Illumination Illumination Studios Paris Amblin Partners (minority) Carnival Films Makeready (JV) NBCUniversal Japan DreamWorks Classics OTL Releasing United International Pictures (JV) Universal 1440 Entertainment WT2 Productions Peacock Hayu Fandango at Home (75%) SkyShowtime (JV) 21.77% Paramount Pictures Corporation (Paramount Global, merger with Skydance Media to form Paramount Skydance Corporation pending) Paramount Pictures May 8, 1912 Miramax (49%) Showtime Documentary Films Paramount Players Republic Pictures BET Films MTV Entertainment Studios Nickelodeon Movies Paramount Animation Nickelodeon Animation Studio MTV Animation CBS Eye Animation Productions Avatar Studios Awesomeness Films Miramax Family (49%) Paramount Digital Entertainment Melange Pictures United International Pictures (JV) Paramount+ Pluto TV BET+ My5 Philo (minority stake) SkyShowtime (JV) 9.55% Warner Bros.
