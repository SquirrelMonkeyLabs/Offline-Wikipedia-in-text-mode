 "text": "The Metropolitan Tabernacle is a large Reformed Baptist church in the Elephant and Castle in London. It was Charles Spurgeon's church for many years. ==History== The tabernacle fellowship dates to 1650 when the English Crown banned Christian denominations other than Puritanism. Membership grew when freedom of religion came to England in 1688. The present London Tabernacle church building dates to 1898, albeit with extensive repairs of damage caused by the Blitzkrieg raids on London. == Other websites == *Metropolitan Tabernacle official site Category:Baptist churches Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Southwark",
