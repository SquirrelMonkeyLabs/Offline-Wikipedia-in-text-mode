 "text": "Lawrence Bender (born October 17, 1957) is an American movie producer. He became famous when he was the producer of Reservoir Dogs in 1992. He has produced all of Quentin Tarantino's movies except Death Proof. In the 1980s, he worked as a grip on the series Tales from the Darkside. In 1989, he produced the movie Intruder, in which leading roles are Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. He has also been the producer on many other successful movies including Good Will Hunting, The Mexican, the 2007 Academy Award winning movie An Inconvenient Truth, Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, and the From Dusk Till Dawn trilogy. He was an executive producer of the Legend of Earthsea TV miniseries. Bender makes cameo appearance in many of the movies he produces: he was a police officer chasing Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs, a guest billed as a \"long- haired yuppie scum\" in both Pulp Fiction and Four Rooms and a hotel clerk in Kill Bill Volume 2. Since May 2005 Bender has been a blogger at The Huffington Post. He now works in Hollywood running the day-to-day operations of his own production company, Lawrence Bender Productions. Bender has been working with Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor to create a television TV series based on the 2007 album Year Zero. ==Filmography== * Tale of Two Sisters (1989) (producer) * Intruder (1989) (producer) * Reservoir Dogs (1992) (producer) * Fresh (1994) (producer) * Pulp Fiction (1994) (producer) * Killing Zoe (1994) (producer) * Four Rooms (1995) (producer) * White Man's Burden (1995) (producer) * Snakeland (1996) (executive producer) * From Dusk till Dawn (1996) (executive producer) * Good Will Hunting (1997) (producer) * Jackie Brown (1997) (producer) * A Price Above Rubies (1998) (producer) * From Dusk till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999) (executive producer) * Anna and the King (1999) (producer) * From Dusk till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000) (executive producer) * Anatomy of a Hate Crime (TV) (2001) (executive producer) * The Mexican (2001) (producer) * Knockaround Guys (2001) (producer) * Lost in Oz (TV) (2002) (executive producer) * Stark Raving Mad (2002) (executive producer) * Nancy Drew (TV) (2002) (executive producer) * Kill Bill (2003, 2004) (producer) * Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004) (producer) * The Survivors Club (TV) (2004) (executive producer) * Voces inocentes (2004) (producer) * Dr. Vegas (TV) (2004) (executive producer, \"Pilot\", \"Limits\") * Earthsea (2004) (exeuctive producer) * The Chumscrubber (2005) (producer) * Build or Bust (TV) (2005) (executive producer) * The Great Raid (2005) (producer) * Goal!
