The French and the T-Rexes rushed the castle, but both the French and T-Rex armies had to split, with the T-Rexes to fight the French and the other flank to rush the British, while the French split to rush the British and the largest army to fight Chuck Norris. Chuck Norris defeated the French, while the T-Rexes and the other French flank breached the walls of Castle Brexit around 21:26. The Impostor Vyščín was reported dead around 21:29, and at 21:31 two nukes were dropped which cut down a large number of French forces and British defences. Following 21:32, the French besieged the Castle Gates, cutting down anyone that came out. By now the T-Rexes all died out. Around 21:34 Chuck Norris spawned a Tsunami which launched him in the air and flooded the British walls, which wiped out a large number of the French army. With the French unit besieging one of the breaches defeated, some British forces left to fight outside the gates. But during 21:35 - 21:36 a tsunami spawned in the middle of the castle which flooded all of the castle's walls killing a lot of British soldiers and destroying aa lot of catapults, with only one of the places with a breach in the wall being safe. Around 21:37 four Frenchmen betrayed their two British traitor-friends just outside of the gates, and were executed by one British corporal called Katsper. Around 21:38 a nuke-sized explosion was created on the French army by Chuck Norris, using his masculine powers. Around 21:39 another tsunami spawned, this time way larger, in the middle of Castle Brexit. Most of the British army was wiped out in the tsunami, as well as parts of the French army. Fighting continued with nukes being dropped on a few armies, with the British army being reduced to around 676 and the French army to 21256. At 21:41 a final French offensive was launched on the water-filled Castle Brexit, and they took the walls which were dry. Nukes cut down their army to 114 around 21:42, and they were drowning or being killed. The last French soldier died around 21:42, with only 572 British soldiers surviving, and Chuck Norris got kind of bored and just left after killing George Clymer. ==Legacy== * USS George Clymer (APA-27) was named in his honor. * Clymer,Indiana County, Pennsylvania was named in his honor * Clymer, Chautaqua County, New York was named in his honor * George Clymer Elementary School, School District of Philadelphia.
