 "text": "Eiparnome was a Nubian king in the kingdom of Nobatia who ruled in the 6th century. Eiparnome is known primarily from a foundation inscription from Dendur, which speaks in Coptic of the conversion of the temple there into a church. The inscription dates to either 559 or 574Welsby, The Mediaval Kingdoms of Nubia, p. 37, fig. 13. It is the oldest written evidence of the Christian church in Nubia. Eiparnome is possibly also mentioned in the account of Longinus, who baptized the king of Alwa after the king of Nobatia had been baptized. This king of Nobatia was called Orfiulo or Awarfilua, which may be a corrupted form of Eiparnome. He is thus the first Christian ruler of Nobatia. Itâ€™s Firstly known for the inscription from the city of Dendur. It is written in the Coptic language. It is about the transformation of the local pagan temple into an Orthodox church. There is controversy about the date of its foundation: 559 or 574. This is the oldest written evidence of the Christian church in Nubia. In 543, he probably received the monk Julian, who introduced Christianity. This date is considered the day of the adoption of the religion by Nobatia. By 549, a clergy was established in the region and liturgies began to be held, but in a Monophysite spirit. . It is suggested that this king is mentioned by Longinus, bishop of Nubia from 565, under the name Orfiulo or Avarfilua. However, it is possible that this refers to the father of Euparnome. In any case, he contributed to the spread of Christianity, which finally took root in Nobatia. Longinus was active there in the years 569-575. It is possible that Euparnome died during the war with Byzantium as a result of the campaign of Aristomachus, sent by the emperor Maurice. It is known that Nobatia was then subjugated to Byzantine rule. == References == == Literature == * Derek A. Welsby: The Medieval Kingdoms of Nubia. Pagans, Christians and Muslims on the Middle Nile.
