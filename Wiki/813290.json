 "text": "\"The Man with Two Brians\" is the 5th episode of the 7th season of Family Guy. It was first shown on the Fox network on November 9, 2008. The episode is about the Griffin family getting a new dog. The episode was written by John Viener. Dominic Bianchi is the director of the episode. Johnny Knoxville, Will Sasso, and Camille Guaty are guest stars for the episode. == Story == Peter, Cleveland, Quagmire, and Joe watch the television show Jackass. They want to record themselves doing dangerous stunts. Peter tries to fly over a lake. He hits a tree and falls in the lake. Brian tries to get Peter out of the lake, but he hurts his back. Joe swims to Peter and Brian and saves them both. Lois is not happy and tells Peter that Brian is getting old. Peter is sad because of this, so he gets another dog. He names it New Brian. New Brian is very happy to be with the family. Brian feels that the family does not want him, so he leaves the house. Stewie does not like New Brian. Stewie wants the first Brian to come back. Brian does not want to until New Brian is not there. Stewie goes to New Brian and tells him that he does not like him. New Brian says that he raped Rupert (Stewie's teddy bear). Stewie kills New Brian, puts him in a trash can, and writes a suicide note that looks like New Brian wrote it. The first Brian comes back to the family. Stewie is traumatized and washes Rupert in a shower. == Production == The episode was written by John Viener. Dominic Bianchi is the director of the episode. The design of New Brian is from a drawing made by Seth MacFarlane (the creator of Family Guy). New Brian was first going to be a Golden Retriever. He was made gray so that he would not be the same color of the kitchen. The episode was first put on DVD on June 16, 2009. Johnny Knoxville, Will Sasso, and Camille Guaty are guest stars for the episode. Viener is the voice actor for New Brian. == Reception == Ahsan Haque of IGN thought that the episode has some \"unfunny (not funny) ideas\" but that it \"succeeds for the most part\". He said that there was a better balance of humor and story. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club did not like how the episode started with Jackass, but he thought that the rest of the story is \"far superior\". Robin Pierson from The TV Critic did not like how the jokes were put together. He said that the episode has \"no point to it.\" == References == == Other websites == * * Category:Family Guy (season 7) episodes Category:2008 television episodes",
