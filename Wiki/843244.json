Human Rights Watch says that they have been used to imprison Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017 as part of a \"people's war on terror,\" a policy announced in 2014. The camps have been criticized by many countries and human rights organizations for alleged human rights abuses. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Prisons in Asia Category:Politics of the People's Republic of China Category:Xinjiang Category:Human rights abuses in Asia Category:2017 establishments in Asia Category:Buildings and structures in China Category:Concentration camps",
