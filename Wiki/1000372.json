 "text": "Martha Elizabeth Beall Mitchell (September 2, 1918 â€“ May 31, 1976) was the wife of John N. Mitchell, United States Attorney General under President Richard Nixon. Her public comments and interviews during the Watergate scandal led to the creation of The Martha Mitchell effect. This is when a psychiatrist mistakenly identifies a patient's true but extraordinary claims as delusions. Her attempted lies about the Watergate scandal eventually led the press and investigators to uncover the truth behind the scandal. Mitchell died on May 31, 1976 at a hospital in New York City from problems caused by multiple myeloma at the age of 57. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Pine Bluff, Arkansas Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma Category:American socialites",
