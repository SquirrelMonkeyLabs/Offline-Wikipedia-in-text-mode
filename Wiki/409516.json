 "text": "Eugene Onegin (, Yevgeniy Onegin) is a novel in verse by Alexander Pushkin. It is a classic of Russian literature. It was published in parts between 1825 and 1832. The first complete edition was published in 1833, and the currently accepted version is based on the 1837 publication. Almost the entire work is made up of 389 stanzas of iambic tetrameter with the unusual rhyme scheme \"AbAbCCddEffEgg\".The uppercase letters represent feminine rhymes while the lowercase letters represent masculine rhymes. This form has come to be known as the \"Onegin stanza\" or the \"Pushkin sonnet.\" The story is told by a narrator (a lightly fictionalized version of Pushkin), whose tone is educated, worldly, and intimate. The narrator digresses at times, commenting on aspects of the social and intellectual world. This helps develop the characters and the drama of the plot. An opera Eugene Onegin by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky has been composed based upon the book. == The storyline == Onegin, a nobleman who has just taken over his uncle's estate, is a fine young dandy, but bored and cynical. He does not value shy, bookish Tatyana Larina. Soon after their meeting she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter. She expresses her love for him. Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances.
