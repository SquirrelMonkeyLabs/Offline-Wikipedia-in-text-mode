 "text": "Humita is a Native South American food. A traditional food from the Andes, it is eaten in Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Argentina. It is made from fresh choclo (Peruvian maize). It is pounded to a paste, wrapped in a fresh corn husk, then slowly steamed or boiled. In Bolivia, it is known as huminta and in Brazil as pamonha. Humitas are like Mexican uchepos, or tamales colados, which are also made with fresh corn; but they are not like tamales, which are made with masa. ==In Argentina== In Argentina, humitas are made with saut√©ed onions, pumpkin, and some spices. The dough is wrapped in corn husks and boiled or it is cooked in a big pan and served in bowls. Diced cheese is often added to the dough, usually queso fresco. They can be found in restaurants and markets in the north of Argentina. ==In Chile== In Chile they are made with onion, basil, and butter or lard.Chef Adds New Zest At La Pena Center, Kim Severson, San Francisco Chronicle, 06-08-1999, access date 05-12-2012 They are wrapped in corn husks and baked or boiled.
