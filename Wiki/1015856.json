 "text": "The Truong Son bug-eyed frog (Theloderma truongsonense) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam and Laos. People have seen it between 300 and 1300 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests on mountains. People have seen them in streams on mountains. The female frog lays 5-12 eggs at a time on leaves. People have seen the tadpoles swimming in water inside hollow tree trunks. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. But it is in some danger because people cut down forests to build farms in the parts of Vietnam where the frog lives. They especially build farms from coffee, tea, and rubber. The frog's home has some protected parks in it: Bach Ma National Park, Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park, Hon Ba Nature Reserve, and Bac Huong Hoa Nature Reserve. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
