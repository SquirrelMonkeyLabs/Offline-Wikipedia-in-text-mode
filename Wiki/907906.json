 "text": "\"'You and Your Friend\" is a song by the British rock band Dire Straits and is the sixth track from the 1991 rock album On Every Street. ==Release== The song was the fifth song to be released as a single. It was the final single overall released by the band. The single was only released in France and Germany. ==Related interview== Mark Knopfler told in interview for \"Musician\": \"I just liked the line. About the time we recorded the first record I had a song called \"Me and My Friends.\" It was a Southern boogie thing about playing in the band. I never recorded it because it never really... \"You and Your Friend\" just has that thing. I like keeping it open for people to use in a way that they want. If you make it specific you spoil it. The song could be just a solitary cry for some kind of support â€” are you going to come around to my way of thinking? It could be sexual. One of the guys saw it as a complicated love triangle. It could be anything. But in fact that came from just the resonance of \"You and Your Friend\" instead of \"Me and My Friends\".\" Category:1991 songs Category:Dire Straits songs Category:Soft rock songs",
