 "text": "Anomaloglossus tamacuarensis is a frog. Scientists found it in Venezuela and Brazil. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in Sierra Tapirapecó and other places. Scientists saw the frog between 300 and 1300 meters above sea level. Scientists saw this frog inside some protected places: Parima-Tapirapecó National Park, Alto Orinoco–Casiquiare Biosphere Reserve, Floresta Nacional do Amazonas, and Parque Estadual Serra do Aracá. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Anomaloglossus do: They think female frog lays eggs on the ground. Scientists say the male frog carries the tadpoles to streams. ==Danger== Scientists from the IUCN say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Much of its home is far away from places that human beings go to or change. Climate change could hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
