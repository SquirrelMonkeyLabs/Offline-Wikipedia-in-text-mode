If left untreated, it can be life-threatening. == Symptoms== Signs and symptoms may include: * severe pain in the stomach * fever, or feeling hot and shivering * tachycardia (quick heart rate) * trouble urinating or urinating less than usual * weight loss. There may also be swelling in the abdomen, feeling or being sick, and a loss of appetite.

If the lining becomes infected and you get peritonitis, the internal organs it covers can also be damaged. == Treatment== After a peritonitis diagnosis, treatment in hospital is needed to get rid of the infection.Treatment usually involves being given antibiotics into a vein (intravenously). If regular kidney dialysis is ongoing, a doctor might discuss a different way of doing it until the peritonitis has been treated. == Related pages == * appendix * gallbladder * acid reflux ==References== Category:Diseases",
