In 1976, Mishra decided that it would support violent revolution but would also use elections and democracy to oppose the Indian National Congress. In the 1980s, they created many different political parties to be a front for them. In the 1990s, they started running in elections themselves. ==Present Day== It is now led by Dipankar Bhattacharya.
