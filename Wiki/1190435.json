 "text": "Patrapeamani was a reigning Nubian queen who ruled at the beginning of the 4th century AD. Patrapeamani is known only from a Meroitic inscription on an offering tablet found in Meroe in the tomb of Beg W309. This offering tablet is stylistically dated very late. It is not certain whether the tablet was removed or whether Beg W309 is the tomb of this ruler. Her parents are also named on the offering tablet (father: Datiley, mother: [...]li). It is not entirely certain whether Patrapeamani was actually a woman. In any case, Patrapeamani is one of the last attested rulers in Meroe. == See also == * List of monarchs of Kush * Meroë pyramids == Literature == * Inge Hofmann: \"Contributions to Meroitic Chronology.\" Anthropos Institute, St. Augustin near Bonn 1978, ISBN 3-921389-80-1, p. 156. 180. * László Török, in: \"Fontes Historiae Nubiorum: Textual Sources for the History of the Middle Nile Region between the Eighth Century BC and the Sixth Century AD.\" Volume III: \"From the First to the Sixth Century AD.\" University of Bergen Press, Bergen 1998, ISBN 82-91626-07-3, p. 1073.
