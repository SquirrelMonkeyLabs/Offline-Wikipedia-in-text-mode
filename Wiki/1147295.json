 "text": "Colostethus ucumari is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Body== This frog has a light stripe on the side of its body. It has almost no webbed skin on its feet. The frog has bright yellow color near where the front legs meet the body, where the back legs meet the body. Its belly is blue-white in color. This frog makes some poison chemicals in its skin. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in cloud forests in the Cordillera Central (middle mountains) in Colombia. Scientists saw the frog between 2100 and 2500 meters above sea level. They find the frogs on grassy plants or under rocks. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Ucumar√≠ and Parque Natural Regional La Pastora. ==Young== After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Humans cut down the forests to make places for cows to eat grass, and rainbow trout fish eat the frogs. Scientists have seen the dangerous fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, where the frog lives, but they do not know if this disease is killing the frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
