 "text": "Emile Cohl was a French artist, caricaturist, and cartoonist. Cohl was one of the first people to have the idea of using Motion picture Technology to make drawings look like they were moving (which is called Animation.) In 1908, Cohl made a short film called Fantasmagorie. Some say Fantasmagorie is the first ever animated cartoon. Cohl wanted to use it to celebrate absurdist art.
