 "text": "The Prince Bishopric of Augsburg was a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire, meaning it was a territory ruled by a prince-bishop. Its territory included a large portion of the Diocese of Augsburg, which the Prince-Bishop only had spiritual power over. == History == The prince-bishopric was established in the city of Augsburg and its surrounding territory in the 4th century. Around the year 888, Augsburg was granted Imperial Immediacy, a high rank given to a territory of the Holy Roman Empire with a high degree of autonomy. In 1276, the City of Augsburg became a Free Imperial City, meaning that it was now separate from the rest of the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg. This meant that the capital of the Prince-Bishopric was changed to Dillingen an der Donau. From 1632 to 1635, the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg was occupied by the Swedish Empire. In 1803, as part of the German mediatisation, the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg became a part of Bavaria. Category:Former monarchies of Europe",
