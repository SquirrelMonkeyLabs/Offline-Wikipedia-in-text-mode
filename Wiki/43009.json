 "text": "A foundry is a place where molten (melted) metals are poured into casts, to make metal things of a certain shape. Aluminum and cast iron are most commonly cast in foundries, but other metals, like bronze, can be cast as well. During casting, parts of different sizes and shapes can be made. Foundries also scrap used metals and recast them into more useful forms. Category:Manufacturing buildings",
