 "text": "The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands was a micronation created as a symbolic political protest by a group of gay rights activists based in southeast Queensland, Australia. Declared in 2004 in response to the Australian government's refusal to recognise same-sex marriages. It is near the islets on the Great Barrier Reef. It is an expression of queer nationalism. As of 17 November 2017, the Kingdom was dissolved, per the decision made by the Australian people to legalize gay marriage. ==References== Category:2004 establishments in Australia Category:Geography of Queensland Category:LGBT",
