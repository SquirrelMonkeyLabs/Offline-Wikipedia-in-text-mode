Promotion WWE Date November 2, 2018 City Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Venue: King Saud University Stadium Attendance 16,000 Crown Jewel (2018) was the inaugural event in WWE's Crown Jewel series, held on November 2, 2018, at the King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, featuring talent from both Raw and SmackDown brands. It was part of a 10-year strategic partnership between WWE and Saudi Arabia's General Sports Authority, supporting the Saudi Vision 2030 reform program. This marked WWE's second event in Saudi Arabia following the Greatest Royal Rumble in April 2018. ==Venue, Attendance, and Presentation== The event took place at the King Saud University Stadium, with an attendance of approximately 16,000. The event was broadcast live on pay-per-view and WWE Network with commentators Michael Cole, Corey Graves, and Renee Young providing English commentary, while Faisal Almughaisib handled Arabic commentary. Hulk Hogan, reinstated into the WWE Hall of Fame earlier in 2018 after a three-year suspension, served as the host of Crown Jewel, marking his return to WWE programming for the first time since 2015. ==Match Card and Key Outcomes== The event featured twelve matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, with several prominent bouts: Main Event: D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) defeated The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) in Michaels' first match since his 2010 retirement and the final time The Brothers of Destruction teamed together. Despite the nostalgia, the match was criticized for its slow pace and the physical limitations of the veteran wrestlers, with commentators noting that the performers operated at about half of their previous intensity. Triple H even suffered a legitimate torn pectoral muscle during the match. Universal Championship Match: Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman to win the vacant Universal Championship, after Roman Reigns relinquished the title due to leukemia relapse, turning the originally scheduled triple-threat into a singles match. Lesnar's victory was praised, though Strowman was criticized for a lack of offensive engagement. WWE World Cup Tournament: Conceived to crown the \"best in the world,\" this eight-man, brand-divided tournament included notable wrestlers like Seth Rollins, Dolph Ziggler, and The Miz. The tournament unfolded with multiple quarterfinal and semifinal matches leading to a final where Shane McMahon unexpectedly replaced an injured Miz and defeated Dolph Ziggler to win the World Cup. Shane’s involvement was heavily criticized for overshadowing wrestlers deserving of the accolade and for portraying him as an overbearing authority figure. WWE Championship Match: AJ Styles successfully defended the WWE Championship against Samoa Joe, in a match that highlighted Joe's early dominance and targeted attack on Styles' knee, ending with Styles retaining via his signature \"Phenomenal Forearm\". SmackDown Tag Team Championship: The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) retained their titles against The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston) with assistance from Big Show, who interfered during the match. Kickoff Pre-show: Shinsuke Nakamura defended the United States Championship against Rusev, retaining his title with a pin after countering Rusev’s submission attempts. ==Storylines and Background== The event’s storylines were built up across WWE's weekly TV shows, Raw and SmackDown, with scripted feuds culminating in the matches featured at Crown Jewel. Significant storyline developments included the reunion of D-Generation X, leading to the challenge against The Brothers of Destruction and the announcement of Shane McMahon’s stipulation to fire losing members of SmackDown’s WWE World Cup finalists. ==Controversies and Criticism== Crown Jewel faced significant criticism linked to its location and political context. WWE encountered harsh backlash due to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, including issues surrounding the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, women’s rights restrictions, and the ongoing Yemen conflict. This led to several top WWE babyfaces like John Cena, Daniel Bryan, and Roman Reigns refusing to participate in the event, with replacements hastily made. Critics widely labeled the event one of the worst WWE shows ever produced, particularly panning the main event’s lethargic pace, the controversial booking of Shane McMahon as the World Cup victor, and the Universal Championship match’s lack of engagement from Strowman. Despite hosting a historic return match and championship bouts, the show was seen as overshadowed by its politics and questionable creative decisions. ==Aftermath and Legacy== The aftermath saw storyline repercussions such as Braun Strowman's feud continuation with Baron Corbin and the usage of Shane McMahon’s World Cup victory in his heel persona development",
