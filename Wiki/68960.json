 "text": "A gift or a present is something (usually money or a good) which is given to someone. People give gifts voluntarily and do not expect anything in return. A gift is usually something that family or friends give to each other on special occasions like a birthday or holiday. For example you will give and / or receive gifts and presents at Christmas time, or chocolate (most commonly chocolate eggs) for Easter. Gifts are usually something that you really want to have. If it is a birthday gift, it would be money or an item that is not costly. A small gift is usually wrapped in wrapping paper while a big gift is most likely to be just given to the receiver or in a box without wrapping. ==Related pages== *Gift economy *Kindness == References == ==Other websites== * * Category:Giving",
