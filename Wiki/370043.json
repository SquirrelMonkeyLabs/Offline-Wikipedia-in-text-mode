 "text": "The W Regional Park is a major national park in West Africa. It is formed around a meander in the River Niger shaped like a \"W\". The park includes areas of the three countries Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso. The W National Park of Niger was formed by decree on 4 August 1954. In 1996 it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the three nations, the Regional park covers about 10,000 kmÂ². Almost no people live in this area. ==Fauna== The park is known for its large mammals, including aardvarks, baboons, buffalo, caracal, cheetahs, elephants, hippopotamuses, leopards, lions, serval and warthogs. The park has a home for some of West Africa's last wild African Elephants. The W Park used to have packs of the endangered Painted Hunting Dog. The National Park is one of the last strongholds for the Northwest African cheetah. There is a small but increasing population of at least 15-25 animals of this rare cat in the park. The W area is also known for its bird populations. There are over 350 species identified in the park.United Nations Environment Programme- World Conservation Monitoring Centre (Content Partner); Mark McGinley (Topic Editor). 2009. \"'W' National Park, Niger.\" In: Encyclopedia of Earth.
