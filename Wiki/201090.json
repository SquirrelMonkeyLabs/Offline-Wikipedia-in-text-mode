 "text": "A Category 5 hurricane is a hurricane with winds over 156 mph. This is a list of the Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. There are no records of a Category 5 hurricane before 1900; equipment was not as good before that. The season with the most Category 5 hurricanes was in 2005, which had four. The most consecutive years with at least one Category 5 hurricane were 2016 to 2019. Category 5 hurricanes are very destructive and many Category 5 hurricanes get their names retired after the season. Of the named Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes only four of them have not had their name retired, the four names are: Carol (1953) although Carol was retired after 1954, Edith (1971), Emily (2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005), and Lorenzo (2019). ==Category 5 hurricanes== This is the list.
