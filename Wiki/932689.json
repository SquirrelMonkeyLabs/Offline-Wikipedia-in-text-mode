 "text": "Southern American plantations are the various plantations of the Antebellum southern US. Such plantations could be whole towns in their own right, with chapels, workshops, slave shacks, etc. At the heart of the plantation was usually a Greek-revival style house occupied by the owner and his family. The main plantation mansion usually has a portico or columned porches. So many plantation houses were constructed in the Greek-revival style that it's sometimes called the plantation style. The hierarchy of an antebellum plantation was akin to that of a feudal manor during the medieval era. Category:History of the United States",
