 "text": "The Spittal of Glenshee lies at the head of Glenshee in the highlands of eastern Perth and Kinross, Scotland where the confluence of many small streams flowing south out of the Grampians form the Shee Water. For centuries, there has been a hostel or inn at the site and, in modern times, the small village has become a centre for travel, tourism and winter sports in the region, sited at a bend on the A93 trunk road which leads from Blairgowrie north past the Spittal to the Glenshee Ski Centre and on to Braemar. Inhabitation in the Neolithic period is indicated by a Megalithic standing stoneThe Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: Spittal Of Glenshee Standing Stone (Menhir) behind the old kirk, and the Four Poster stone circle on a nearby mound.Spittal Of Glenshee -Four Poster stone circle When interest in ski mountaineering revived after the First World War and the Scottish Ski Club was resuscitated in 1929, they restarted weekly snow reports with reporters appointed at Lix Toll near Killin, Dalwhinnie, Braemar and the Spittal of Glenshee. The Dundee Ski Club used the Spittal Hotel as its meeting place, and pioneered improvements, setting up the first ski tows in Britain at Glenshee in December 1950. The hotel burnt down in 1959, but Spittal of Glenshee has continued to provide accommodation near to the slopes. The village also provides a stopping place on the Cateran Trail waymarked long distance footpath which provides a 64-mile (103 km) circuit in the glens of Perthshire and Angus.Cateran Trail Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland ==References== Category:Villages in Scotland Category:Perth and Kinross",
