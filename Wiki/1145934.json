 "text": "The Constitution of San Marino consists of a series of legal documents and statutes developed over centuries. It forms the legal and political foundation of the Republic of San Marino. It is regarded as one of the world’s oldest constitutions still in effect. The foundational document, known as the \"Statutes of 1600,\" codifies various laws and principles that are essential to the governance of the republic, some of which date back to as early as the 13th century. == Historical background == The development of San Marino’s constitution began in the 13th century when the republic started formalizing its governance through a series of statutes and laws. The primary legal document, known as the \"Statutes of 1600,\" was ratified as a comprehensive framework to govern the republic. These statutes outlined San Marino’s commitment to independence, justice, and democratic values, principles that continue to guide the country’s governance today. San Marino’s constitution has evolved through amendments and additional laws, but its core principles remain rooted in historical statutes. This legal continuity is seen as one of the reasons behind the country’s political stability and independence. == Related pages == * Grand and General Council * Captains Regent * Politics of San Marino San Marino Category:San Marino",
