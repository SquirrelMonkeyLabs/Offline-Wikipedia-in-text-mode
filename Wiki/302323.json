In February 1983, it changed its name to the J. Paul Getty Trust.Miller, Russell, House of Getty (London: BBC Audiobooks America, 1987); ARTnews, April 1984.

To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the provenance of various antiquities in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General, Munitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to \"forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending.\"Martin Filler, \"The Getty: For Better and Worse.\" The New York Review of Books, November 16, 2006, p. 47.
