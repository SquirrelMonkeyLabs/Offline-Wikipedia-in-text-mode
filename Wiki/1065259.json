 "text": "The Zaniskari is a small mountain horse or pony from Ladakh, named after the Zanskar region in Kargil. It shares characteristics with Tibetan breeds from neighboring Tibet and Baltistan. The Zaniskari is of medium size and often has a grey coat. The breed is endangered, with only a few hundred remaining. This horse is well adapted to serve as a pack animal in the challenging conditions of its native region, situated between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level, where temperatures can drop to −40 °C. It is strong, sure-footed, and has good stamina. == Population == In 1977, there were about 15,000–20,000 Zaniskari horses. At that time, they were considered not at risk. However, due to cross- breeding with other horses, only a few hundred pure-bred Zaniskari horses are left today, mostly in the valleys of Ladakh, including the Zanskar Gorge. To protect and preserve the breed, the Animal Husbandry Department of Jammu and Kashmir runs a farm in Padum, Zanskar. The population has decreased because of machines and more roads in their native area. Despite this, as of 2006, there were no significant signs of genetic issues. In 2013, there were around 9,700 Zaniskari horses, but by 2022, their conservation status was marked as \"at risk/critical maintained,\" with a reported population of 346 animals. == References == Category:Horse breeds",
