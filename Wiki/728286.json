The population was 6,410 at the 2020 census. == History == The city was founded in 1867 by the Union Pacific railroad company. It grew up around the military base called Fort Sidney (also known as Sidney Barracks). The soldiers there were stationed to guard transcontinental railroad from potential Indian attacks. When the railroad reached Sidney, it was the end of a sub-division of the rail line. Sidney had a roundhouse, repair facilities, and a railroad hotel for passengers. The city was named after Sidney Dillon. He was president of the Union Pacific Railroad at that time. The town became the southern end of the Sidney Black Hills Stage Road in the late 1870s and 1880s.
