 "text": "The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the Major League Baseball (MLB) players determined to be the best fielders at each fielding position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL). Voting is done by the managers and coaches in each league, and they may not may not vote for their own players. Sabermetrics affect about 25 percent of the vote. In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to honor the best fielding performance at each position. At first, only one Gold Glove was given out to the top fielder at each position in Major League Baseball; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958. Eighteen Gold Gloves have been awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league. The trophy is a glove made from gold lam√©-tanned leather and it is attached to a walnut base. ==Sources== Category:Major League Baseball awards",
