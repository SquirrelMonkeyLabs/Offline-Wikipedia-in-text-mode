 "text": "Baise-moi is a 2000 French crime drama thriller movie. It was called Rape Me in the United States, where it was released without an MPAA rating. In Australia, Baise-moi was rated R18 at first, but was then refused classification due to content. This movie got mixed reviews from critics in many countries. Un baise in French means \"a kiss\", but as a verb, baiser means \"to fuck\", so Baise-moi means \"fuck me\". It is about a sex-and-violence spree by two young women. The sex scenes are apparently real, rather than simulated, and the film has been banned in many countries. == Other websites == * Category:2000 thriller movies Category:2000 crime drama movies Category:2000s crime thriller movies Category:French crime movies Category:French drama movies Category:French-language movies Category:French thriller movies Category:Movies about revenge Category:Rape in movies Category:Obscenity controversies",
