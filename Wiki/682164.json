 "text": "Lavington's Hole is a Civil War-aged tunnel in the town of Bridgnorth, Shropshire. Several caves known as the Hermitage Caves also exist near the tunnel, dug out during the Saxon era by Alfred the Great's grandson. == History == After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington and his Roundhead team dug seventy meters underneath Castle Hill, where the castle is. He knew that the Cavaliers stored gunpowder in the church so he wanted to blow it up. The tunnel was never completed as the Royalists surrendered on April 26, 1646. It is now deemed \"unsafe\" to enter the tunnel and surrounding dwellings. == References == Category:Shropshire",
