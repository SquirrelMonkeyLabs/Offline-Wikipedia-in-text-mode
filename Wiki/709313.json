 "text": "In concurrent computing, multiple calculations are made within overlapping time frames. It takes advantage of the concept that multiple threads or processes can make progress on a task asynchronously. This general approach to writing and executing computer programs is called concurrency. Concurrency is different from parallel computing, as parallel computing uses multiple processors, each of which are assigned a single, synchronous thread. Category:Computer science",
