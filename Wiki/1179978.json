 "text": "In chemistry, specifically the Lewis acid-base theory, a Lewis adduct is the result of a Lewis base sharing a pair of electrons with a Lewis acid. Lewis adducts have a special type of chemical bond called a dipolar bond: where most covalent bonds are thought of as having one electron from each atom, in a Lewis adduct, both of the electrons come from one side (the base). The atoms in the dipolar bond have opposite formal charges. == References == Category:Chemical compounds",
