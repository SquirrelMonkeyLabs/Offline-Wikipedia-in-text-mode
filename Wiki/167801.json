 "text": "The Pirelli Calendar is a calendar (publication showing dates for the year) published by Pirelli company's UK subsidiary. It started in 1964 and is now very famous because only a few calendars are published each year, and these are given to important people (VIPs) and Pirelli customers. The calendars have photographs of female models including nudes. After 1974 publication of the calendar was stopped because there was not enough money after the oil crisis. Ten years later it was started again and has been published regularly ever since. Many famous models have been photographed for the calendar including: Sienna Miller, Naomi Campbell, Gisele Bündchen, Sonny Freeman Drane, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford, Selma Blair, Lauren Bush, Elsa Benitez, Laetitia Casta, Rachael Leigh Cook, Milla Jovovich, Doutzen Kroes, Heidi Klum, Sophia Loren, Penélope Cruz, Brittany Murphy, Amy Smart, Julia Stiles, Karolina Kurkova, Caroline Trentini, Raica Oliveira, Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Bridget Moynahan, Shannyn Sossamon, Mena Suvari, Monet Mazur, Aurelie Claudel, Fernanda Tavares, Isabeli Fontana, Frankie Rayder, Angela Lindvall, Hilary Swank and Yamila Díaz. == Other websites == *Official Pirelli Calendar Site with Image Archives Category:Calendars",
