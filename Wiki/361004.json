 "text": "Bolivian coriander (Porophyllum ruderale) is an annual plant. Its leaves can be used for seasoning food. The taste has been described as \"somewhere between arugula, cilantro and rue.\" The plant is commonly grown in Mexico and South America. There it is used in salsas. When fully grown, this plant grows to about 5 feet in height and 3 feet in diameter. This herb is known by many names, including quillqui침a (also spelled quirqui침a or quilqui침a), killi, papalo, tepegua and p치paloquelite. Also, even though the name is \"Bolivian coriander\", this plant is not botanically related to the coriander. * Category:Herbs Category:Asteraceae",
