 "text": "A colposcope is a special device that is used to look at the cervix and the vagina, which are usually hidden from sight. Colposcopy can be used to detect cervical cancer, in its early stages, or to detect an infection with HPV. Colposcopy is also important when documenting the damage done in the case of sexual assault. The procedure was first used by Hans Hinselmann, German gynecologist, in 1925. == References == Category:Obstetrics and gynecology",
