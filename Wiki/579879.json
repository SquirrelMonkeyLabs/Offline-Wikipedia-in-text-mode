 "text": "On the morning of 7 April 2017, during the Syrian Civil War, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea into Syria, aimed at Shayrat Air Base. The strike was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump as a direct response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack on 4 April 2017. The strike was the first unilateral attack by the United States military to intentionally target the Ba'athist Syrian government forces during the war. President Trump justified the strike by stating that it is in the national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons in the world. ==References== Category:2017 in Asia Category:2017 in the United States Category:April 2017 events Category:2010s in Syria",
