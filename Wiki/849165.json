 "text": "Divisibility rules of whole numbers are very useful because they help us to quickly determine if a number can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 without doing long division. This is especially useful when the numbers are large. == Divisibility Rule of 1 == Any integer is divisible by 1. Eg:- 23, 84, 974, 1023 == Divisibility Rule of 2 == If a number is an even number or a number whose last digit is an even number. Eg:- 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 == Divisibility Rule of 3 == When the sum of all digits of a number is a multiple of 3. Eg:- 516, 36, 117, 5502 == Divisibility Rule of 4 == When the number formed by last 2 digits is divisible by 4. Eg:- 92, 780, 52, 300 == Divisibility Rule of 5 == When the ones digit of the number is either 0 or 5. Eg:- 55, 125, 1000, 760 == Divisibility Rule of 6 == A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 and 3 also. Eg:- 270, 630, 144, 42 == Divisibility Rule of 7 == When the difference between twice the digits at ones place and the number formed by the other digits is either zero or a multiple of 7. Eg:- 1078, 98, 56, 140 == Divisibility Rule of 8 == The number formed by last 3 digits is divisible by 8. Eg:- 1792, 1824, 2000, 2880 == Divisibility Rule of 9 == When the sum of all digits of a number is a multiple of 9. Eg:- 51984, 2979, 9000, 135 == Divisibility Rule of 10 == When the ones digit is zero. Eg:- 1000, 150, 670, 280 Category:Number theory Category:Arithmetics",
