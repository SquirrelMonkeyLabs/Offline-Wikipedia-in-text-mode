 "text": "CNN Airport was an American television network. Owned and operated by WarnerMedia, it was a special version of CNN that only played in United States airports. The network broadcast news, entertainment, stock market updates, weather, and travel news to 58 airports across the United States. CNN paid airports to show the channel exclusively on their monitors. CNN Airport's 24-hour schedule was described as roughly 16% news, 19% live sports, 24% lifestyle, 24% travel, and 10% for custom messages from airports if they wish to use the timeslot. On January 12, 2021, CNN's president Jeffrey Zucker announced that the network would be closed by the end of March. == References == == Other websites == * Official website Category:CNN Category:Airports Category:American television networks",
