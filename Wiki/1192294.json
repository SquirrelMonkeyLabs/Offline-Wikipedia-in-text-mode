It (does much of the same, or) achieves performance similar to NVIDIA H100. NVIDIA H100 chips were banned from sale to China by US government in 2022. DeepSeek researchers say Huawei Ascend 910C provides 60% of NVIDIA H100 inference performance. DeepSeek R1 model (see DeepSeek), was trained on NVIDIA H800, but runs inference [or inference engines] on Ascend 910C. In late April 2025 Huawei started delivering to customers CloudMatrix 384 - a cluster consisting of Ascend 910C chips. The system performs better than NVL72 (72 GB200 chips) from NVIDIA; However the power consumption is (much or) very much higher. ==References== Category:China",
