Retrieved in April 28, 2016 was a conflict between colonial Spaniards and Mapuche people of Araucanía region, of modern Chile. This conflict began at Reynogüelén in 1536, near the confluence of the Ñuble and Itata rivers. It was between an expedition of Diego de Almagro and a large, well organized group of Mapuche soldiers. Since 1609, each governor of Chile held \"Parlamentos\" with Mapuche chiefs. At these, they discussed maintenance of a treaty between both parties. Violations of the treaty were frequent. In 1881, these finally ended, with a process known as the Pacification of Araucanía. == References == == Other websites == * Serindígena.org - Maps * Maps of battles of Arauco War Category:History of Chile Category:Wars involving Spain Category:Wars involving South America Category:16th-century conflicts Category:17th-century conflicts Category:Araucanía Region",
