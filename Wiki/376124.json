 "text": "Jesus College is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It was created in 1496. It took over buildings from a nunnery (a place where nuns live), including the chapel which was called Jesus Chapel. Because of this it still looks more like a monastery than a college. It has very big gardens and is one of the largest colleges in Cambridge with more than 700 students. Some very famous people have studied here, for example Thomas Cranmer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Laurence Sterne. == Other websites == *Official website Category:Colleges of the University of Cambridge Category:1490s establishments Category:15th-century establishments in England",
