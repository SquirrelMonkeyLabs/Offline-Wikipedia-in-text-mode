 "text": "Abortion in Florida is mostly illegal after six weeks of pregnancy. Many women do not know they are pregnant in the first six weeks. This law started in May 2024 and was signed by Governor Ron DeSantis. Only Republican lawmakers supported the law, while Democrats were against it. Since 2015, women must also visit a doctor twice, 24 hours apart, before getting an abortion. This rule was made by Governor Rick Scott. There are some exceptions to the six- week ban. A woman may get an abortion up to 15 weeks if her pregnancy is from rape, incest, or human trafficking. She needs to show proof of this. Another exception is if doctors find that the fetus has a condition that will cause it to die before birth. In this case, two doctors must agree. Also, if the mother’s life is in danger, an abortion can happen at any time. From 1868 to 1972, abortion was illegal in Florida unless it was needed to save the mother's life. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that abortion was a right in the Roe v. Wade case. However, in 2022, the Supreme Court overturned this decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, giving states like Florida the power to make their own abortion laws. In November 2024, people in Florida voted on Amendment 4, a proposed change to the Florida Constitution. This amendment would have stopped the Florida Legislature from banning abortion before the fetus can survive outside the womb, which is usually around 23 to 24 weeks. If the amendment passes, it would have cancelled current laws like the six-week ban. The amendment received 57% of votes, but it needed 60% of voters to agree, so it failed. == References == Category:U.S. abortion laws by state Category:Abortion in the United States",
