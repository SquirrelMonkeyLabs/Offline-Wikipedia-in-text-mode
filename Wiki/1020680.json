It was only built on Scania N113DRB chassis. East Lancs misspelled bus names on purpose (naming it \"Cityzen\" instead of \"Citizen\") In 2000, the Cityzen was replaced by the East Lancs OmniDekka. == Gallery == File:FOWLERS Hollbeach Drove - Flickr - secret coach park.jpg|Fowlers Scania N113DRB with East Lancs Cityzen bodywork File:Maghull Coaches N756OAP (9137628536).jpg|Open-top Maghull Coaches Scania N113DRB with East Lancs Cityzen bodywork File:Arriva bus 7391 Scania N113 East Lancs Cityzen N391 OTY in Newcastle 9 May 2009 pic 2.jpg|Arriva North East Scania N113 with East Lancs Cityzen bodywork rear ==References== ==Other websites== * Cityzen Category:Double-decker buses Category:Step-entrance buses",
