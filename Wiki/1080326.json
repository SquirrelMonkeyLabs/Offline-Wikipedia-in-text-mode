 "text": "Promissum is an extinct genus of conodont from the Upper Ordovician period. It is macrophagous, meaning it is probably a nektonic carnivore. It is one of the very few specimens preserving a body outline. Well-preserved specimens were discovered in the Soom shale of South Africa in 1994. A preserved specimen of this behemoth reveals details of the trunk musculature, feeding apparatus and eyes. == Description == Promissum was a rather large conodont, up to 40 cm (16 inch). It had a primitive mouth under its eyes with mineralized teeth. It looked like a small eel or large worm, lacking any kind of fins except for perhaps a small one on the tail. It was probably capable of maintaining a cruising speed. However, it could not maintain rapid bursts of speed. == References == # Palmer, D., ed. (1999).
