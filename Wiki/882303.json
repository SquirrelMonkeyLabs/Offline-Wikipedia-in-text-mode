 "text": "The Mixteca Alta tree frog (Sarcohyla ameibothalame) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it in only two places: a pine and oak forest between 2455 and 2670 meters above sea level in the Sierra Mixes in Oaxaca. Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place and because human beings cut down the forests where it lives to get wood to build with and make farms. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could also kill this frog. It lives in mountain forests with pine and oak trees. People have seen it on bromeliad plants. The tadpoles swim in streams. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
