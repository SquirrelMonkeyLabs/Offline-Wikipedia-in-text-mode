 "text": "A regent is a position of government in a country where there is a monarchy (like a king or queen). As an \"acting monarch\" the regent does the job of a monarch where the real monarch is either too young, sick or cannot do what they are meant to for some other reason. A regent may also be voted in if there are no heirs in line to the throne, for instance, if the current monarch dies with no surviving relatives. ==Related pages== *Regency era Category:Government occupations",
