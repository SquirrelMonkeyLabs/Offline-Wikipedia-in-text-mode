 "text": "Agkistrodon piscivorus, also known as the cottonmouth snake, water moccasin, or water viper, is a species of highly venomous pit viper (a type of snake) found throughout southeastern United States. Commonly called cottonmouths because of their all-white mouth, they are often confused with Northern water snakes, which are harmless, but the cottonmouth is much the opposite. == Habitat == Cottonmouths live throughout southeastern United States, often found in water sources, such as marshes, bogs, lakes, rivers, ponds and almost every body of water you could imagine. == Diet == The cottonmouth's diet consists of birds, frogs, toads, lizards, smaller cottonmouths, small alligators and turtles, and a few other things. A lot of snakes eat whatever they can find. == Venom == Cottonmouths are one of the most dangerous snakes in the world. Remember the rhyme: if it's white, stay away! If it's not, you'll live to see another day. Category:Vipers Category:Venomous animals Category:Snakes of North America",
