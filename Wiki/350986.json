 "text": "A cluster bomb, or cluster munition, is an explosive device. It explodes in the air or on the ground, and releases many smaller bombs. It is an anti- personnel weapon because it kills or maims people, not armoured vehicles. They were used a lot during the Vietnam War and have been used in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are considered illegal by over 100 countries. These countries have signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions adopted in May 2008. ==Related pages== *Russian invasion of Ukraine category:Explosives",
