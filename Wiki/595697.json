 "text": "Clyde and Willis, created by Andrew Hendrich Wilson, are the title characters of the American-British-Chinese comedy television show The Clyde and Willis Show. The creator of the show, Andrew Wilson thought of the idea while he was drawing two stick-mans in his early years. He then thought of an idea about making the two stick-mans into a comic. He then animates the comic to the two characters we know to this very day. They first appeared in the 2015 missing pilot episode \"Clyde and Willis\".o == Clyde Harrison == Clyde Arthur \"Claude\" Harrison, is a \"Psychopathic\", stupid and a sometimes whimsical Britain character that moved to America from England with his best friend, Willis Hennig. He is sometimes a violently psychopath who always freaks out and smash things when he is angry and he has a disorder. Clyde and his best friend Willis live in the same house and together they are roommates, or \"ROOMIES\" they call it. Clyde is sometimes also a jerk to his friends and will be a total punk sometimes. He is mostly related to the 90s adult-kids cartoon character Ren Hoek from the 1990s cartoon series, The Ren and Stimpy Show. They both are psychopaths and sometimes will insanely happy. == Willis Hennig == Willis Thompson \"William\" Hennig, unlike Clyde, he is a much more intelligent, smart, and crazy person. He and Clyde are the best friends in the show. He would be crazy and loud sometimes like Clyde. He sometimes would also be a complete idiot. He is related to the 90s adult-kids cartoon character Stimpson \"Stimpy\" J. Cat from the 1990s cartoon series, The Ren and Stimpy Show. He is sometimes smarter and sometimes an idiot. His friend, Clyde, described him as a \"idiot of intelligence\". He always hates it when his friend Clyde says his catchphrase: \"LOOK OVER THERE\". He has two brothers and a sister. His brothers, Sammy and Johnny would sometimes annoy Willis at the same time, and Willis wish they didn't exist in his world. Category:Animated characters",
