 "text": "Dorsetichthys is an extinct, prehistoric fish from the Early Jurassic period of Europe. It contains only one species, Dorsetichthys bechei. It is the only member of its family, Dorsetichthyidae in the order Dorsetichthyiformes. == Description == Dorsetichthys looked like a herring, but it was not related to them. It had a single dorsal fin, a symmetrical tail, and an anal fin. It also had large eyes. == Taxonomy == D. bechei was traditionally a species of Pholidophorus. However, Arratia (2013) said it was distinct from the type species of Pholidophorus and created a new order and family for Dorsetichthys. == References == # Palmer, D., ed.
