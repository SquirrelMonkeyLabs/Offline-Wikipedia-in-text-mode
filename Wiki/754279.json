 "text": "Hemostasis or haemostasis is a process to prevent and stop bleeding, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). The blood could have problems with carrying out thus clotting process because of drugs (vitamin K for example) and certain conditions, like haemophilia or Von Willebrand disease. It is the first stage of wound healing. This involves coagulation, blood changing from a liquid to a gel. Intact blood vessels are important to moderating blood's tendency to form clots. The word hemostasis (, sometimes ) uses the combining forms hemo- and -stasis, New Latin from Ancient Greek αἱμο- haimo- (akin to αἷμα haîma), \"blood\", and στάσις stásis, \"stasis\", yielding \"motionlessness or stopping of blood\". == Related pages == * Platelet ==References== Category:Blood",
