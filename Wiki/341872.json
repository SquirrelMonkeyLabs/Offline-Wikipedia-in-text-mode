 "text": "The Paraná River is a river in south Central South America. It goes through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. It is long. It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers. The name Paraná is a shortened form of the phrase \"para rehe onáva\". It is a Tupi word that means \"like the sea\". It starts where the Paranaiba and Grande rivers join in southern Brazil. It joins the Paraguay River and continues south, where it merges with Uruguay River, before flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. The surubí and the sábalo are fished on the river. There are many dams along the river. The Yacyretá and Itaipu are used for hydroelectric power. ==References== Category:Rivers of Argentina Category:Rivers of Brazil Category:Rivers of Paraguay",
