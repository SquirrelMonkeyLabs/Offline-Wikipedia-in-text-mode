 "text": "The San Ysidro McDonald's massacre was an act of mass murder which happened at a McDonald's restaurant in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego, California, on July 18, 1984. The shooter, 41-year-old James Huberty, fatally shot 21 people and wounded 19 others before being killed by a police sniper about 77 minutes after the shooting began. At the time, the massacre was the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in U.S. history. Huberty was a conspiracy theorist and survivalist, who believed the Cold War was going to end the world and that president Jimmy Carter and, later, Ronald Reagan and the United States government were working against him.The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications p. 15 ==References== Category:1980s murders in the United States Category:1984 in California Category:Mass murder in California Category:Mass murder in the 1980s Category:Mass shootings in California Category:History of San Diego",
