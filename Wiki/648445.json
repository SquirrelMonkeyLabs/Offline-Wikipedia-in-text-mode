 "text": "Kathleen O'Day Wynne (born May 21, 1953) is a Canadian politician. She was the 25th Premier of Ontario and the leader of the Ontario Liberal Party from 2013 to 2018. Wynne was the first female premier of Ontario and the first openly LGBT premier in Canada. As of 2025, Ontario is the largest population to have ever popularly elected an openly LGBTQIA+ head of state or government. She was the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Don Valley West from 2003 to 2022. ==2018 provincial election== Wynne and the Liberals began their 2018 provincial election campaign on May 9, 2018. They were doing very badly in the opinion polls against the Progressive Conservatives. Their leader was former Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford. An analysis of several polls by the CBC showed that the Progressive Conservatives had the most support out of all the parties. On the day of the election, the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government and the NDP became the Official Opposition. The Liberals won only seven seats in the Legislature. This was their worst result since Confederation. == Related pages == *List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: Wâ€“Z ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian LGBT politicians Category:Lesbians Category:People from Richmond Hill, Ontario Category:Politicians from Toronto Category:Premiers of Ontario Category:University of Toronto alumni",
