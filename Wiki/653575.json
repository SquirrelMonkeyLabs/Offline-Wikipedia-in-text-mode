 "text": "Birbal (born Mahesh Das; 1528 16 February 1586), or Raja Birbal, was a Hindu advisor in the court of the Mughal emperor, Akbar. Birbal was appointed by Akbar as a poet and singer in around 1560. He was one of the navaratnas (nine jewels of Akbar). He is mostly known in the Indian subcontinent for the folk tales which focus on his wit. In the local folk tales he is presented as a very clever person. These tales are popular in India. These tales involve him being smarter then or making fool of other courtiers and sometimes even Akbar, using only his intelligence and cunning. From the twentieth century onwards, plays, movies and books based on these folk tales were made. Some of these folk tales are in children's comics and school books. == References == Category:1528 births Category:1586 deaths Category:Akbar Category:Mughal Empire Category:16th century in India",
