 "text": "Metrology is the study of Measurements. It starts a common understanding of units for human uses. Modern metrology goes back to the French Revolution's need to replace the old units with natural new ones, this led to the creation of the metric system. As the metric system was adopted by other countries, a new foundation was made called Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). This foundation evolved into the International System of Units (SI) from a resolution that was made. There are 3 basic activities of Metrology, these are: * The set standards of units. * The use of these units in practice. * Traced measurements made in practice to the standards. These activities overlap, making the 3 sub-fields of Metrology: * Applied Metrology, the use of it in real life. * Scientific Metrology, the making of units. * Legal Metrology, the law and use of the units in law. == References == Category:Measurement",
