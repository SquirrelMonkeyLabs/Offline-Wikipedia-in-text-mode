 "text": "Vib-Ribbon is a PlayStation game created by Masaya Matsuura, the same people who created PaRappa the Rapper. The game was released in Japan on December 9, 1999, and then in Europe on September 1, 2000. The game wasn't available to North America until it was re-released for the Playstation Network in October of 2014. The game has spawned 2 Japan-only sequels: Mojib-Ribbon and Vib- Ripple. Originally, the game was going to advertise the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, but due the poor quality it had, the idea was dropped. You play as Vibri, a wireframe rabbit, though she technically in the lore, does it herself. The buttons are as follows: L, R, Down button & X. If you keep the combo up for an extended amount of time, Vibri turns into Queen Vibri. The said obstacles are: A loop-the-loop, a pothole, spikes and a ledge. The levels are, Tutorial (How to Play), Bronze (Easy), Silver (Normal) And Gold (Hard). The style of the game is meant to be a take on the games from 1970-1980. Vib-Ribbon had a resurgence in popularity in the recent years, spanning lots of fanart of Vibri, memes and a community of its own. == References == Category:1999 video games Category:Monochrome video games Category:Music video games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Single-player video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games about evolution Category:Video games about rabbits and hares Category:Video games developed in Japan",
