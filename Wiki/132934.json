 "text": "Mount Olympus (; also transliterated as Ólympos, and on Greek maps, Óros Ólimbos) is the highest mountain in Greece. It is high. Since its base is at sea level, it is one of the highest mountains in Europe in terms of topographic prominence, the relative altitude from base to top. In Greek mythology the mountain was regarded as the \"Home of the Gods\", specifically of the Dodekatheon, the twelve principal gods of the ancient Hellenistic world. == References == ==Other websites== * Revisiting the determination of Mount Olympus Height (Greece) * Mount Olympus * Greek Mountain Flora Category:Biosphere reserves Category:Balkan Mountains Category:Mountains of Greece Category:Greek mythology",
