 "text": "Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and the first to be released internationally by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. The album saw Morissette changing her style and genre. Morissette's sound in the album was rock, but her previous songs were dance pop. The title is a metaphor for lessons of life that are hard to accept. The album was Morissette's breakthrough album, and contained six hits, \"You Oughta Know\", \"Ironic\", \"You Learn\", \"Hand in My Pocket\", \"Head over Feet\", and \"All I Really Want\". The album spent twelve weeks at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart. By 2009, the album had sold 33 million units worldwide. It was ranked by the Billboard 200 as the number one selling album of the 1990s. During the three consecutive years in the late 1990s of Grammy Awards, Morissette received five wins out of nine nominations from the album. In 1996, she won the Album of the Year & Best Rock Album. Her 1997 nominations such as \"Ironic\" for Record of the Year & Best Music Video in Short Form did not win her an award. But in 1998, she won again for Best Music Video in Long Form from her release of Jagged Little Pill, Live. In October 2002, Rolling Stone ranked it number 31 on its Women In Rock - The 50 Essential Albums list, and in 2003 the magazine ranked it number 327 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album also holds a title in The Definitive 200 Albums list, in which it is placed at number 26. ==Chart precession and succession== ==Singles== Year Title Chart positions CAN Singles U.S. Hot 100 U.S. Hot 100 Airplay U.S. Modern Rock U.S. Mainstream Rock U.S. Adult Top 40 U.S. Top 40 Mainstream UK Singles AUS Singles 1995 \"You Oughta Know\" 20 6 13 1 3 7 22 4 \"Hand in My Pocket\" 1 15 1 8 25 4 26 13 1996 \"Ironic\" 1 4 2 1 18 5 1 11 3 \"You Learn\" 1 6 1 7 40 3 1 24 20 \"Head over Feet\" 1 3 25 1 1 7 12 1997 \"All I Really Want\" 2 65 14 59 40 ==Related pages== * List of best-selling albums worldwide ==References== Category:1995 albums Category:Alanis Morissette albums Category:Grammy Award- winning albums",
