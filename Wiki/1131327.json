 "text": "The Cotopaxi rocket frog (Hyloxalus fallax) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.2â€“18.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 16.8 mm long. The frog has a white belly. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have water in the air. Scientists saw at least one frog in a bromeliad plant. Scientists saw these frogs between 1760 and 2430 meters above sea level. ==Name== Scientists named this frog fallax in Latin for \"tricks people\" because it looks like a different frog. ==Young== Scientists think the tadpoles swim in streams. ==Danger== This frog is in big danger of dying out and they might all be dead now. If they are not all dead, then only 249 or fewer are alive today. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms and get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
