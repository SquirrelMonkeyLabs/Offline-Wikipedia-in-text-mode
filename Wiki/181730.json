 "text": "The Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti (Bengali: পার্বত্য চট্টগ্রাম জনসংহতি সমিতি Parbotto Chôṭṭogram Jônoshônghoti Shomiti, or PCJSS, ) is a political party formed to represent the people and indigenous tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Since its inception in 1973, the PCJSS has fought for Autonomy and the recognition of the ethnic identity and rights of the indigenous tribes of the Hill Tracts. Its military arm, the Shanti Bahini was used to fight government forces and Bengali settlers in the Hill Tracts. A Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord signed in 1997 led to the disarmament of the Shanti Bahini and enabled the PCJSS to return to mainstream politics. ==References== Category:1973 establishments in Bangladesh Category:Chittagong Hill Tracts Category:Political parties in Bangladesh",
