The Chateau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art is in the town. Montsoreau is both listed part of the Loire Valley, a UNESCO world heritage site, and among the most beautiful villages of France. ==History== ===Bronze Age=== The main evidence of early settlement is the dolmen of the Pierrelée, which probably dates from the 3rd millennium BC. Montsoreau is located on the borders of the territories of the Gallic tribes of Pictones, Turones and Andecavi. Coins, shards and fragments of Gallo-Roman tiles were found in Montsoreau, especially on the edge of the plateau above the town. ===Classical antiquity=== Montsoreau was identified under the name Restis (rope or fish net) at the end of classical antiquity as a port on the Loire at the confluence of the Loire and the Vienne. It kept this name until the end of the eleventh century. The name Montsoreau (Mount Soreau) comes from a rocky promontory in the riverbed of the Loire and surrounded by water. There have been three major buildings on this promontory, a Gallo-Roman temple or administrative building, a fortified castle, and a Renaissance palace. ===Middle Ages=== The first fortified castle was built by the count of Blois at the end of the tenth century, immediately taken by The Count of Anjou, Fulk Nerra, who took the fortress in 1001 and incorporated it to Anjou. Fulk, who was one of the first great builders of castles, modified it, and the fortress remained under the control of Anjou, never taken, for more than 150 years. In 1152, Guillaume IV de Montsoreau sided with Geoffroy Plantagenet against his brother Henry II Plantagenet, future king of England and husband of Eleanor of Aquitaine. Henri II besieged the castle and took it at the end of August 1152. This was the only storming of the fortress of Montsoreau between Fulk and Jean II de Chambes in 1450. At the end of the Hundred Years War, Charles VII and Louis XI installed royal power in Chinon. They encouraged or ordered their lords to build new buildings or redevelop old fortresses. Thus began the construction of buildings in a new style in France, giving birth to Renaissance architecture, with the renowned \"Châteaux of the Loire Valley\". In 1450, Jean II de Chambes, first counsellor of Charles VII and ambassador in Venice, bought the fortress of Fulk III to his brother in law and destroyed it in order to build a residential palace on the top of the rock of Montsoreau. He built the Château de Montsoreau in a residential style following Italian architecture of the time which makes it the first Renaissance building in France. The Château de Montsoreau was directly on the river bank and it is the only château to have been built in the river bed of the Loire. ===Early modern period=== In 1572, four days after Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre (24 August) in Paris, Jean de Chambes started the \"St. Bartolomew Angevine\". He almost eliminated the Reformed Church both in Saumur and Angers. After the French Revolution, the exploitation of a building stone, the Tuffeau stone, increased its population of 600 inhabitants to more than 1000, maintained during the first half of the nineteenth century. ===Modern period=== The battle of Saumur, is considered as the first act of resistance of World War II in France. > In Montsoreau, Saumur and Gennes, in June 1940, teenage students of the > school of cavalry, still under training and with derisory weapons (including > an artillery gun from the school museum), heroically engaged an entire > German panzer division for nearly three days.
