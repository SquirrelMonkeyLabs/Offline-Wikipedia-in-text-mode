 "text": "Return to Never Land (also known as Peter Pan in Return to Never Land or simply Peter Pan II) is a 2002 American animated movie. It was produced by DisneyToon Studios in Sydney, Australia. The movie is a sequel to the 1953 Peter Pan. ==Voice cast== Because nearly five decades had passed since the original Disney movie, a new cast of voice actors was used for this sequel. Kathryn Beaumont, who was the voice of Wendy in the original, recorded all of the now-adult character's dialogue for Return to Never Land. Disney Studios later had Kath Soucie completely rerecord the role.Animated Views: Beaumont and Kerry: Peter Panâ€™s Leading Ladies, interview with Kathryn Beaumont * Blayne Weaver as Peter Pan * Harriet Owen as Jane * Nancy Cartwright as young Wendy. * Corey Burton as Captain Hook * Jeff Bennett as Smee * Kath Soucie as Wendy Darling * Andrew McDonough as Danny * Roger Rees as Edward * Spencer Breslin as Cubby * Bradley Pierce as Nibs * Quinn Beswick as Slightly * Aaron Spann and Tony Anselmo as Twins * Dan Castellaneta, Jack Angel, Peter Cullen, Phil Proctor, Patrick Dempsey, Robin Williams, Frank Oz, Paul Eiding, Bill Farmer, Daran Norris, Patrick Pinney, and John Goodman as Pirates * Jim Cummings as Turk * Rob Paulsen as Jukes * Clive Revill as Elderly Officer * Bill Hader as Narrator * Frank Welker as Nana II and Giant Octopus * Wally Wingert as Chorus *Mae Whitman as Tinker Bell ==References== Category:2002 movies Category:2002 animated movies Category:Sequel movies Category:Pirate movies Category:Movies about children Category:Movies about families Category:Movies set in London Category:Movies set in the 1940s Category:World War II movies Category:Disney animated movies",
