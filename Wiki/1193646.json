 "text": "Mashadeakhel (also Mashadakhel) was a Nubian king who probably ruled in the second or third century C.E. He’s so far known only from the Pyramid Beg W113 in Meroe. His name is recorded there in Meroitic script on a fragment of an offering tablet. It is doubtful that this is his pyramid. The tablet may have been stolen in ancient times. == Biography == His origin is uncertain, and his name is unusual for a Kushite king. He is mentioned only in an inscription on a sacrificial tablet in pyramid W113 at Meroe. There is considerable doubt among scholars as to whether this burial was of Mashadeahel. He was probably a usurper who overthrew King Ariesebohe (a female relative) around the C.E.220s and was able to hold on to the throne for almost 20 years. He was overthrown around C.E.246. Tekerideamani became the successor. == Literature == * [Inge Hofmann]]: \"Contributions to Meroitic Chronology\", St. Augustin near Bonn 1978, p. 155, ISBN 3921389801 * László Török, in: \"Fontes Historiae Nubiorum, Vol. III\", Bergen 1998, pp. 954–955, ISBN 8291626073 Category:Kings of Nubia Category:Kushites Category:Born in the 2nd or 3rd century Category:Died in the 2nd or 3rd century",
