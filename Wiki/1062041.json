 "text": "The New Jersey Plan, also known as the Small State Plan or the Paterson Plan, emerged during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 as a counter-proposal to the Virginia Plan. William Paterson of New Jersey, along with other delegates from less populous states, voiced concerns about the Virginia Plan's bicameral legislature and proportional representation, fearing it would empower larger states at their expense. The New Jersey Plan advocated for a unicameral legislature, maintaining equal representation for each state, echoing the one- vote-per-state approach of the Articles of Confederation. The plan proposed amending the Articles of Confederation, granting Congress additional powers such as the ability to raise funds through tariffs, regulate interstate and international commerce, and collect taxes based on free inhabitants and three- fifths of slaves. It also outlined the election of a federal executive and the establishment of a federal judiciary, emphasizing the supremacy of the Articles of Confederation and treaties. Despite its rejection on June 19, 1787, the New Jersey Plan influenced the compromise that followed. The Connecticut Compromise, blending elements of both the Virginia and New Jersey Plans, resulted in the current structure of Congress, featuring a Senate with equal state representation and a House of Representatives based on population.
