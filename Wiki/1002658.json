 "text": "Salford Quays is an area of Salford, at the end of the Manchester Ship Canal. It was the site of Manchester Docks, which were opened in 1894 by Queen Victoria. In 1983, Salford City Council bought a lot of the land. They started by cleaning the water and stocking it with fish. The Salford Quays Centre for the Performing Arts opened in 2000 and is known as The Lowry. MediaCityUK followed. It has both broadcasters and shops. == References == Category:Salford",
