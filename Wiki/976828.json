 "text": "\"Ditanyè\" is the national anthem of Burkina Faso. ==Lyrics== Verses two and three and the second chorus are little known and rarely performed. French lyrics Mossi lyrics Bobo lyricshttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=394562691998220 English translation I Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years. Against the cynical malice in the shape Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants. Many gave in and certain others resisted. But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood Have fortified our courageous people And fertilised its heroic struggle. And one single night has drawn together The history of an entire people, And one single night has launched its triumphal march. Towards the horizon of good fortune. One single night has brought together our people With all the peoples of the World, In the acquisition of liberty and progress. Motherland or death, we shall conquer! II Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution, The volunteers for liberty and peace With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4th of August Had not only hand arms, but also and above all The flame in their hearts lawfully to free Faso forever from the fetters of those who Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of Independence and sovereignty. III And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity, Love and honour partnered with humanity, The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation. Down with exploitation of man by man! Forward for the good of every man By all men of today and tomorrow, By every man here and always! IV Popular revolution our nourishing sap. Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man. Eternal hearth of agreed democracy, Where at last national identity has the right of freedom. Where injustice has lost its place forever, And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen, Suns of boundless joy shine. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Burkinabé culture",
