 "text": "Scoutcraft is a form of woodcraft skills used in the woods and the \"backcountry.\" Though it has been practiced for hundreds of years, it was first called \"scoutcraft\" by Robert Baden-Powell and Ernest Thompson Seton, who wrote books about it about a hundred years ago. What scoutcraft is has varied throughout the years and from country to country. For example, in England, scoutcraft once included citizenship, while in America, it once included indian lore and signaling. At present, scoutcraft includes camping, hiking (walking through the woods or backcountry), backpacking (a combination of camping and hiking), orienteering (use of a map and compass to find ones way through the backcountry), pioneering (building structures out of logs using knots), first aid, and wilderness survival. ==References== Category:Scouting",
