 "text": "J.Lo is the second studio album by American singer and entertainer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on January 16, 2001 by Epic Records and became her best-selling album. Epic Records released 4 singles to promote the album. The album was re-released in July 2001. It contained three bonus tracks. Due to usage of slurs such as \"nigga\", \"bitch\" and \"fuck\" in \"I'm Real (Murder Remix)\", the re-edition has been released with 'Parental Advisory' sticker. Also the album has been released without label, despite strong language and sexual content. == Track listing == # \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" (Damon Sharpe, Greg Lawson, Georgette Franklin, Jeremy Monroe, Amille Harris) – 3:42 # \"I'm Real\" (Jennifer Lopez, Troy Oliver, Cory Rooney, L.E.S) – 4:57 # \"Play\" (Anders Bagge, Arnthor Birgisson, Christina Milian, Rooney) – 3:32 # \"Walking on Sunshine\" (Lopez, Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Mario Winans, Jack Knight, Michael \"Lo\" Jones) – 3:46 # \"Ain't It Funny\" (Lopez, Rooney) – 4:06 # \"Cariño\" (Lopez, Rooney, Manny Benito, Neal Creque, Jose Sanchez, Frank Rodriguez, Guillermo Edghill, Jr.) – 4:15 # \"Come Over\" (Combs, Winans, Michelle Bell, Kip Collins) – 4:53 # \"We Gotta Talk\" (Lopez, Rooney, Oliver, Tina Morrison, Steve Estiverne, Joe Kelly) – 4:07 # \"That's Not Me\" (Combs, Winans, Kandice Love) – 4:33 # \"Dance with Me\" (Combs, Winans, Knight, Jones) – 3:54 # \"Secretly\" (Lopez, Rooney, Oliver, Khalilah Shakir) – 4:25 # \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\" (Lopez, Oliver, Rooney, Cheryl Lorraine Cook, Clifon Nathaniel Chase, O'Brien Anth, Sylvia Robinson) – 3:44 # \"That's the Way\" (Rodney Jerkins, Fred Jerkins III, LaShawn Daniels, Nora Payne) – 3:53 # \"Dame\" (with Chayanne) (R.
