 "text": "The Northern water snake, or Nerodia sipedon, is a species of non-venomous snake found throughout North America. == Habitat == The Northern water snake is true to its name and is often found swimming in bodies of water including bogs, marshes, lakes, rivers, ponds and streams. They are also sometimes found basking, since like all snakes they're cold-blooded, and they're sometimes found under logs or rocks near a water source. == Diet == The Northern water snake eats mostly small fishes, reptiles, amphibians, small mammals and insects. == Defense == The Northern water snake, if threatened, will bite even though its bite isn't venomous, and musk on you. Their form of defense is very similar to that of Garter snakes. Category:Colubrids Category:Snakes of North America",
