 "text": "Bruksvallsloppet is an international cross-country skiing event, held in Bruksvallarna, Sweden over a Friday-Sunday in November every year. The event acts as FIS World Cup preselection. The competitions are international. During some seasons the event is the final before the World Cup opens. During other seasons, the event instead occurs between World Cupe events. This depends on if the FIS World Cup starts by late October, or if it begins by mid-late November. In Sweden, the event is generally considered the first major competition of the season. ==References== ==Other websites== *Officiall website Category:Sports competitions Category:Skiing in Sweden",
