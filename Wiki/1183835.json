 "text": "The Domus Sanctae Marthae (Latin for Saint Martha's House; ) is a building adjacent to St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. In 2013, Pope Francis chose it as his residence instead of using the usual papal apartment in the Vatican Apostolic Palace. ==History== The Domus Sanctae Marthae was originally a care facility for the sick, established by Pope Leo XIII in 1881 during a cholera outbreak in Rome. Later, during World War II, Pope Pius XII used it as a refuge for Jews and diplomats. In 1996, Pope John Paul II designated it as a residence for cardinals during the conclave, along with the Sistine Chapel. == References == ==Other websites== Category:Vatican City",
