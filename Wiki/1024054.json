 "text": "Bypass in cybersecurity refers to the act of getting round security measures or controls put in place to protect a system or network. This can be done in many ways such as exploiting vulnerabilities, using social engineering tactics, or using specialized tools and techniques. Bypassing security measures allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, install malware, or carry out other harm. It is important for individuals and organizations to regularly update their security measures and implement multi-layered defences to prevent bypassing attempts. Category:Computer security",
