 "text": "Operation Gibraltar was a secret military plan by Pakistan in 1965 to enter the region of Jammu and Kashmir, aiming to create unrest and start a rebellion against Indian control. Named after the Rock of Gibraltar, the operation was intended to be a strategic move. However, it led to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. == Background == === Kashmir Conflict === The Kashmir conflict began in 1947 when British India was divided into India and Pakistan. Kashmir, a region with a majority Muslim population, was a disputed area. The ruler of Kashmir chose to join India, leading to the first war between India and Pakistan. Since then, there have been ongoing conflicts, with both countries claiming the region. === Pakistan's Plan === Pakistan wanted to use Operation Gibraltar to take advantage of any discontent in Kashmir. The plan was to send soldiers disguised as locals into Jammu and Kashmir to stir up trouble and encourage people to rebel against Indian rule. == Planning and Execution == === Preparation === The Pakistani military carefully planned Operation Gibraltar. They trained thousands of soldiers to blend in with the local population and carry out guerrilla warfare. These soldiers, called the \"Gibraltar Force,\" were split into groups and sent to different parts of Kashmir. === Infiltration === In August 1965, Pakistani forces crossed the ceasefire line (now known as the Line of Control) secretly. Their goal was to cause disruptions, attack Indian military positions, and incite local unrest. They hoped that their actions would lead to a rebellion. == Outcomes == === Indian Reaction === India quickly discovered the infiltration and launched a strong counter-attack. The Indian Army responded effectively, pushing back the infiltrators and preventing significant local support for the insurgents. === Escalation to War === When Operation Gibraltar failed to achieve its goals, the conflict escalated into a full-scale war. On September 1, 1965, Pakistan launched another operation, called Operation Grand Slam, to capture the town of Akhnoor. This led to widespread fighting between India and Pakistan, including battles in Punjab and Rajasthan. === Major Battles === Key battles during the war included: * Battle of Chhamb: Pakistani forces advanced but were eventually stopped by Indian troops. * Battle of Asal Uttar: A significant tank battle where Indian forces successfully defended against Pakistani advances. * Battle of Haji Pir Pass: Indian forces captured the important Haji Pir Pass, disrupting Pakistani supply lines. == Aftermath == === Ceasefire and Agreement === The war ended on September 23, 1965, with a ceasefire arranged by the United Nations. The Tashkent Agreement, signed on January 10, 1966, confirmed the ceasefire and required both sides to return to their pre-war positions. The agreement also called for peaceful discussions to resolve the Kashmir issue. === Long-term Effects === Operation Gibraltar and the war showed how volatile the Kashmir conflict was and the risks of using covert operations. The conflict highlighted the challenges of using guerrilla tactics against a well-prepared military. == Legacy == === Military Lessons === Operation Gibraltar is studied as an example of the difficulties in conducting secret operations. It demonstrated the importance of local support and accurate intelligence and showed the risks of misjudging the enemy's response. === Ongoing Conflict === The Kashmir conflict continues, with occasional skirmishes along the Line of Control. Operation Gibraltar is a reminder of the deep-rooted nature of the dispute. It also influenced military and political strategies in both India and Pakistan. === Diplomatic Impact === The war and its aftermath led to increased international pressure on both countries to seek peaceful solutions. The conflict also contributed to an arms race and heightened military readiness in both nations. == Related pages == * Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 * Line of Control * Kashmir Conflict * Sino-Indian War == References == # Ganguly, Sumit.
