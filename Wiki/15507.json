 "text": "The Czech language is a Slavic language officialy spoken by people in the Czech Republic. Ten million people speak it. It is very similar to the Slovak language; the differences between these two languages are small enough that speakers of Czech and Slovak usually understand each other. It has three genders and is an inflected language like Latin. The grammar is much more complex than that of English. ==References== == Other websites == * mluvtečesky.net – website for learning Czech language (in many languages) Category:West Slavic languages Category:Czech culture",
