 "text": "In Roman mythology, Quirinus was an early god of the Roman state. In Augustan Rome, Quirinus was also a name of Janus, as Janus Quirinus.In the prayer of the fetiales quoted by Livy (I.32.10); Macrobius (Sat. I.9.15); == History == Quirinus was originally most likely a Sabine god. The Sabines had a settlement near the site of what was to become Rome, and erected an altar to Quirinus on the Collis Quirinalis, the Quirinal Hill, one of the Seven Hills of Rome. When the Romans settled there, they absorbed the cult of Quirinus into their early belief system — previous to direct Greek influence — and he was said to be the deified Romulus. In later times, however, Quirinus became far less important, losing his place to (Juno and Minerva and Mars' place). == Notes == Category:Roman gods and goddesses",
