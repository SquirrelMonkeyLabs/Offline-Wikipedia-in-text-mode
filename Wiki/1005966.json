 "text": "The British Government dispatched the Cripps Mission on 23th March, 1942, led by Sir Stanford Cripps, to speak with Indian officials in order to gain their cooperation and commitment for Britain's efforts in World War II. The Indian leaders were assured that they would be given full self-government after the war. The first meeting was with Gandhi on 24th March, 1942 and then on 30th March, 1942 with the Congress. (Official Negotiators: Jawaharlal Nehru, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Sardar Ujjwal Singh, Savarkar M.R. Jaykar, and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar) However, both Congress and Muslim league rejected this proposal for different reasons. Gandhi did not like the idea of states separated from united India. Mr. Jinnah did not wish to compromise on the constitution-making process even though he could see the making of Pakistan built into this proposal. In response to this proposal, a new movement was formed, 'QUIT INDIA', led by Mahatma Gandhi. Category:1940s in India",
