 "text": "Rhyncholaeliocattleya Dinh Thuy Yen Jones & Scully, 1974 is a hybrid orchid of the family Orchidaceae, registered by the Royal Horticultural Society in 1974 to honor the Vietnamese philanthropist Thuy Yen Dinh. The creation of this orchid contributed to the international visibility of Vietnam and helped stimulate tourism in the region. == Name origin == The hybrid was dedicated to Thuy Yen Dinh (1934–2004), a prominent figure in the political and philanthropic history of South Vietnam. Born in Rạch Giá into a noble family, she was among the first women in the world to hold high political office. She served as a member of the National Assembly of South Vietnam from 1959 to 1963. She was also a benefactor of public infrastructure projects, including the Vì Dân Hospital (now Thong Nhat Hospital) and the Ngô Sĩ Liên School in Sơn Hòa, which she funded personally. Revered by the people, she remains a respected figure among the Vietnamese diaspora, also known as \"Tư Nết\" and by her French name \"Annette\" Tran Thien. == Taxonomy == * Current RHS name: Rhyncholaeliocattleya Dinh Thuy Yen * Registered name: Brassolaeliocattleya Dinh Thuy Yen (RHS 1974) * Registrant and hybridizer: Jones & Scully * Year of registration: 1974 * Genus: Rhyncholaeliocattleya * Grex: Dinh Thuy Yen == Genetic ancestry == * Seed parentage: ** Cattleya Derna ** Cattleya Luminosa (1901) * Pollen parentage: ** Rhyncholaeliocattleya Jewel Higdon ** Rhyncholaeliocattleya Mellowglow == Genetic composition == The following genetic breakdown lists the principal ancestral species by estimated percentage: * Cattleya dowiana – 49.22% (subgenus Cattleya, section Cattleya) * Cattleya tenebrosa – 15.63% (subgenus Crispae, section Crispae, series Cattleyodes) * Cattleya bicolor – 5.86% (subgenus Intermediae) * Rhyncholaelia digbyana – 5.47% * Cattleya cinnabarina – 4.30% * Cattleya wallisii – 3.91% * Cattleya mossiae – 3.13% * Cattleya xanthina – 1.95% * Cattleya warscewiczii – 1.95% * Cattleya schroederae – 1.56% * Cattleya dowiana var. aurea – 1.56% * Cattleya harpophylla – 0.78% * Cattleya intermedia – 0.78% * Cattleya crispata – 0.78% == Botanical description == Rhyncholaeliocattleya Dinh Thuy Yen is a medium-sized hybrid orchid known for its showy, fragrant, and long-lasting flowers. The blossoms, typically 6 to 8 cm in diameter, display vibrant hues ranging from pink to orange, with a richly colored, ruffled labellum. Blooming generally occurs in summer or autumn. == Cultivation == * Light: Bright but filtered light; best suited to well-lit greenhouses. * Temperature: Warm- temperate; 15°C (night) to 25°C (day). * Medium: Coarse pine bark, perlite, charcoal. * Watering: Regular during active growth; reduced during dormancy. * Fertilization: Balanced fertilizer every two weeks during growing season. == Medicinal use == Since antiquity, the roots of some orchids have been cooked, dried, and ground to make salep, a starchy, protein-rich flour believed to have medicinal properties. In traditional medicine, the \"Lady’s Slipper\" (Cypripedium calceolus) was believed to have antispasmodic properties. However, modern studies indicate that true therapeutic effects of the Orchidaceae family are limited or nonexistent. Additionally, due to their endangered status, international regulations strictly prohibit the collection of wild orchids. == References == == Bibliography == * Suozzi, Roberto Michele.
