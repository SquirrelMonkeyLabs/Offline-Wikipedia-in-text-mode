 "text": "Markt Schwaben is a town in Bavaria, Germany. It is about 23 km east of Munich on the northern edge of the Upper Bavarian district of Ebersberg. Neighbouring communities are Anzing, Forstinning, Pliening and Poing, (all in Ebersberg district) as well as Finsing, Ottenhofen and Pastetten (all in Erding district). ==Geography== Through the town flows the Hennigbach, into which empties the Gigginger Bach southwest of Markt Schwaben. The River Sempt flows by to the east. The highest point in town is in the Wittelsbacher Höhe (heights) on the town's southern outskirts, which forms part of an alpine terminal moraine. Also in the south is the sport centre with its bathing pond. North of the railway tracks is the Burgerfeld new town with its theatre hall, more housing estates and several commercial-industrial areas. The castle with the town hall, the marketplace and St. Margaret's Church are downtown, and the school centre somewhat southwest of there. ==Gallery== File:MS- Marktplatz.JPG|The marketplace (towards the southwest) File:MS- Brunnen.JPG|Fountain at the market File:MS-Wasserturm.JPG|Watertower File:Markt Schwaben 004.jpg|St.Margaret's (Erdinger Straße) File:MS- Denkmal1.JPG|First World War memorial File:MS-Denkmal2.JPG|War memorial from 1900 with addition for Second World War File:MS-Schulhaus.JPG|Old schoolhouse, Erdinger Straße File:MS-Haus.JPG|Old house in Drechslergasse.
