 "text": "An electric match is a device that uses electricity to ignite a flammable compound. Usually, it is made of two wires. When an electric current is applied to the two wires, they will ignite the compound. Electric matches are used when it is important to know the exact time at which the compound catches fire. Example uses include airbags, pyrotechnic devices (fireworks) and explosives. Because they can be used to ignite explosives, some countries have trade restrictions on electric matches.
