 "text": "In calculus, integration by substitution is a method of evaluating an antiderivative or a definite integral by applying a change of variables. It is the integral counterpart of the chain rule for differentiation. The solution for a system can be usually found by utilizing graphing, but it may not be the most precise method. For a definite integral, it can be shown as follows: \\int_{a}^{b} f(\\varphi(x))\\varphi'(x)dx = \\int_{\\varphi(a)}^{\\varphi(b)} f(u)du Where u = \\varphi (x) so that du = \\varphi '(x)dx . == Steps == # Let a variable equal part of the integrand, so that its derivative will cancel with the other part of the integrand # Apply the substitution # Evaluate the integral in terms of the new variable == Definite integral example == Consider the integral \\int_{1}^{3} \\tan(3x)dx Let u = 3x to obtain du = 3dx and dx = \\frac{du}{3}. In this case, the x variable is not present, so the 1/3 can be factored out of the integrand. Since the integral is now in terms of u, the bounds of integration (1 and 3 in this case), must be plugged in to the substitution u=3x. So the new bounds of integration are 3 and 9 to obtain, \\begin{align} &\\frac{1}{3} \\int_{3}^{9} \\tan(u)du = \\frac{1}{3} (\\ln|\\sec(9)|-\\ln|\\sec(3)|)\\\\\\ &\\approx 0.02767 \\end{align} The antiderivative of \\tan{(u)} may also be found using integration by substitution and ends up being \\ln{|\\sec(u)|}. ==References== Category:Calculus",
