It had been working as a National Library, not just a Parliamentary Library, since 1901. In 1901, a Commonwealth Parliamentary Library was started to help the newly formed Federal Parliament of Australia. From its beginning, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library began to develop of a truly national collection. In 1907 the chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee, Sir Frederick Holder, gave the reasons for having the library. Australia should have a great public library, like the famous Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. It would be a home for the literature of the world, for ever. The library building was opened in 1968. ==Collections== The Library's collections of Australian objects has become the nation's single most important collection of materials recording the Australian cultural history. The Library collects Australian materials of all kinds including: * books * serials * newspapers * maps * music * ephemera (small unimportant things that are not usually kept) * online publications * unpublished material like manuscripts, pictures and oral histories.
