 "text": "A pentadecagon or quindecagon or 15-gon is a shape with 15 sides and 15 corners. == Regular pentadecagon == All sides of a regular pentadecagon are the same length. Each corner is 156°. All corners added together equal 2340°. === Area === The amount of space a regular pentadecagon takes up is : \\begin{align} A = \\frac{15}{4}a^2 \\cot \\frac{\\pi}{15} & = \\frac{15}{4}\\sqrt{7+2\\sqrt{5}+2\\sqrt{15+6\\sqrt{5}}}a^2 \\\\\\ & = \\frac{15a^2}{8} \\left( \\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{15}+ \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{5+\\sqrt{5}} \\right) \\\\\\ & \\simeq 17.6424\\,a^2. \\end{align} a is the length of one of its sides. == Uses == A regular triangle, decagon, and pentadecagon can completely fill a plane vertex. 15",
