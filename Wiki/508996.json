 "text": "Alayhi as-salām (AAS) is a phrase Muslims say whenever they refer to the name of any prophet, messenger, and chosen figure of God. \"Peace be upon him\" is the English translation of alayhi as-salām. The phrase is used in Islamic practice to show respect. Muslims say or write the phrase to get Allah's blessings for the prophet/messenger, and in turn, get blessings for themselves.John L. Esposito, What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam, Second Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 128 The abbreviations PBUH and AAS are used in writing in the Muslim world in private and sometimes government documents. The Qur'an, the holy book of Islam, says this respect must be given. == Related pages == * Wives of Muhammad * Islamic honorifics * Companions of the Prophet == References == == Other websites == * The article Peace Be Upon Him & Christian Polemics explains the usage of the honorific from a linguistic perspective. * عليه السلام – Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
