 "text": "An emergency medical technician (EMT) is someone who works on an ambulance and takes care of sick and hurt people. EMTs used to be called \"ambulance drivers,\" since much of their work is bringing people to an emergency room. Their other main duty is first aid including: * Doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and give electric shocks to a person's chest if their heart is beating in a way that could kill them * Giving oxygen (or force oxygen into a person's lungs) if they stop breathing or are not breathing well enough to survive * Inserting an airway adjunct into a persons mouth in the case of unconsciousness * Stopping hemorrhaging (bleeding so bad that it will kill a person if not stopped) * Treating burns * Treat very bad physical trauma (injuries) * Helping people who are pregnant give birth * Treating broken bones, dislocated joints, sprains, and wounds == In the United States == In the United States, each state decides what their EMTs can do. EMTs in every state are allowed to perform first aid. Each state has different rules for exactly what their EMTs can do. These rules are called treatment protocols. For example: * In Massachusetts, EMTs can give medicines to treat heart attacks, breathing emergencies (like asthma attacks), anaphylaxis, very low blood sugar, and overdoses on opiates like heroin and oxycodone. * In New Hampshire, EMTs are allowed to place a rescue airway in a patient who cannot breathe. This means they will place a tube down the patient's throat, then force oxygen into the lungs through the tube. == Related pages == * Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom * Combat medic * List of EMS provider credentials ==References== == Other websites == *National EMS Memorial Service ==External links== * National Highway Traffic Safety Agency, Office of Emergency Medical Services * United States National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians Category:Technicians Category:Healthcare occupations",
