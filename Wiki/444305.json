 "text": "Teuvo Henri Matias Teräväinen (born September 11, 1994) is a Finnish ice hockey centre. He currently plays for the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Career== He was selected in the first round of the 2011 KHL Junior Draft by the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. He made his SM-Liiga debut with Jokerit on October 18, 2011. He played 40 games and ended up winning the Jarmo Wasama memorial trophy as the best rookie in the league. He decided to enter the 2012 NHL Entry Draft and he was ranked as the second best skater out of Europe by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. He ended up being drafted 18th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks. During his second season with Jokerit, he played 44 games and scored 31 points. He signed a three-year contract with the Blackhawks in the following August. After he signed the contract, he participated in the Blackhawks' training camp but he returned to Jokerit for the 2013-14 season. When Ilari Filppula moved to the KHL, Teräväinen was put in as the first line centerman for Jokerit. He, however, started the season pretty slowly, and only scored two points in the first nine games. He was able to eventually pick up his game, and after a successful tournament at the World Junior Championships, he went on to a 13 game point streak, where he scored five goals and 18 assists. He ended the season with 44 points in 49 games. When Jokerit was eliminated from the 2014 playoffs, it was announced that he would go to Chicago to join Blackhawks for the rest of the 2013–14 season. He made his NHL debut on March 25, 2014 in a 4-2 win against the Dallas Stars. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Finnish ice hockey right wingers Category:Rockford IceHogs (AHL) players Category:Sportspeople from Helsinki",
