 "text": "The West Midlands is an official Region of England, covering the western half of the Midlands. == Geography == The official region contains the large conurbation that includes Birmingham and Wolverhampton and includes also the mainly rural shire counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire.
