 "text": "Fasolasuchus (meaning Fasola crocodile) is the largest rauisuchian to be discovered. It grew to 10 meters (33 ft) long and weight 2 tons which outweighs any of the present land predators such as the polar bear, grizzly bear, and the siberian tiger. It lived 220-205 million years ago in the Late Triassic in what is now known as Argentina. It is known from only a skull so far. Unlike the Postosuchus, this Fasolasuchus had only one row of osteoderms. It's bite force would have been high as it had a similar skull shape to that of the Tyrannosaurus.
