 "text": "Rosie and Jim (sometimes written as Rosie & Jim) is a British children's television programme 'produced by Ragdoll Productions. It was aired on ITV from 1990 to the year 2000. The programme continued to be intermittently repeated on CITV until August 2004. Rosie and Jim are two ragdolls who live aboard a narrowboat coincidentally named the Ragdoll, which is from Birmingham. They sit with a concertina on their lap, and come alive when no one is looking, to explore the world that they pass by on their canal. They learn to experience things by following Ragdoll's owner on adventures and secretly join in with them. Usually, they end up causing trouble but they never get caught because no one ever sees them (ever).
