 "text": "\"Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat\" is the name of a siamese cat in the children's book, Sagwa the Chinese Siamese Cat by Amy Tan. Sagwa's popularity with children prompted a Canadian educational animated series of the same name on PBS Kids. In the series of the same name that is otherwise referred to as Sagwa for short, which is set circa 1900 during the Qing dynasty, Sagwa has fun in her day-to-day life while teaching the Chinese language and learning valuable life lessons. The show is notable for its setting and messages about family and loyalty. ==Voice cast== * Holly G.
