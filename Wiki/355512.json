This begins very suddenly and very intensely. # At the same time, more neuropsychiatric symptoms begin. These are just as quick and severe. The symptoms are from at least two of these categories: ## Fear with or without a reason (Anxiety) ## Problems with feelings and/or sadness (Depression) ## Aggression ## Behavioral regression (acting like a younger child) ## Problems in school ## Sensory or movement problems (e.g. suddenly bad handwriting) ## Other symptoms, including sleep problems, bed-wetting or using the toilet very often # Symptoms cannot be better explained by other illnesses such as Sydenham's chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, Tourette disorder or others.Swedo, S., Leckman, F., Rose, N. From Research Subgroup to Clinical Syndrome: Modifying the PANDAS Criteria to Describe PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome). Pediatrics & Therapeutics, 2012 Feb; 2(2). == Similar conditions == PANS shares symptoms with other diseases. Therefore diagnostic tests must be done to exclude other conditions like Sydenham's chorea, lupus erythematosus, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Tourette syndrome. Proof of acute rheumatic fever would exclude a PANS classification. == Treatment == There is no direct treatment for PANS available yet. This means today only some of the symptoms can be treated.Storch EA, Murphy TK, Geffken, G et al, \"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for PANDAS-Related Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Findings From a Preliminary Waitlist Controlled Open Trial\", Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry: October 2006 - Volume 45 - Issue 10 - pp 1171-1178 . But scientists are already working to develop treatments with antibiotics and immune-based therapies that can heal the disease.Perlmutter SJ, Leitman SF, Garvey MA, \"Therapeutic plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin for obsessive-compulsive disorder and tic disorders in childhood\", Lancet 1999; 354 : 1153 – 58. Nevertheless early and consequent treatment of the symptoms seems to be important. Otherwise the disease can become a lifelong problem.Germana Moretti, Massimo Pasquini, Gabriele Mandarelli et.al.: \"What every psychiatrist should know about PANDAS: a review\".
