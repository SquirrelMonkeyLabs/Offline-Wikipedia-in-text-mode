 "text": "Gilbert Stein (January 11, 1928 â€“ March 24, 2022) was an American lawyer, law instructor and former professional ice hockey executive. Stein served with the National Hockey League (NHL) as vice-president and legal counsel for nearly 15 years before becoming the fifth and last president of the NHL in 1992. Stein served in that role for a year until shortly after the owners appointed Gary Bettman to the newly created post of commissioner. Stein was initially inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993, but withdrew after allegations that he had improperly manipulated his own nomination. Stein died from heart disease on March 24, 2022 at a retirement center in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania at the age of 94. ==References== ==Other websites== * * A Hall of Shame Candidate * Is NHL ready for Stein * Gil Stein (NHL President 1992-1993) Category:1928 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Lawyers from Philadelphia Category:National Hockey League commissioners Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:Writers from Philadelphia Category:Deaths from cardiovascular disease",
