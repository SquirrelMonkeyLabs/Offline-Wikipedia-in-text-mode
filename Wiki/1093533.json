 "text": "The Ouya (styled as OUYA) was a game console running a custom version of the Android operating system and was developed by Ouya Inc. Development of the console was started by a fundraiser on the platform Kickstarter. The console started being shipped out early to people who funded the console in March of 2013 and started being sold to normal people in June of 2013. It had a custom store for applications and games made for the Ouya. Without any required setup, it could install applications like Twitch or Kodi for streaming. It ran a changed version of Android Jelly Bean with the creators recommending to change the operating system more. The way the console was made also allowed the console to be easily opened using a normal screwdriver allowing to easily fix or change the console's hardware. The console was discontinued on the 27th of July 2015 and the servers being shut down on the 25th of June 2019. == References == Category:Video game consoles",
