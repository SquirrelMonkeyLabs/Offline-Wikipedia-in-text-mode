 "text": "Singh is derived from the Sanskrit word Siá¹ƒha meaning \"lion\". It is a common title, middle name, or surname in Northern India originally used by the Kshatriya (Rajput) warriors and kings. Singh was first used as a surname by Hindu kings. As per the instructions of Guru Gobind Singh, the use of Singh as a middle or a last name is mandatory for all baptized male Sikhs since 1699, regardless of their geographical or cultural binding. The surname has also been widely adopted by many other groups of India later. Some Bhumihars and Maithil Brahmins also use this name. \"Singh\" has gradually emerged as a hereditary title to be used as a middle name, highlighting connections to a warrior status or occupation. However, this is not an exclusive usage, and many Hindu groups including Scheduled Castes and Vaishya have adopted this title without any significant warrior status or ties. Singh is widely used by Sikhs, and Kshatriya community (Rajputs) as either a middle name or a surname. ==References== Category:Titles Category:Sikhism",
