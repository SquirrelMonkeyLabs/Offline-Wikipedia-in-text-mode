Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, the group also features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals albums. Bayley spent his childhood in Massachusetts and Texas before moving to Oxford, where he met the other band members at school. Their first album, Zaba (2014), made way for the single \"Gooey\", which was eventually certified platinum in the United States. Their second full album, How to Be a Human Being, received positive reviews and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. The third, Dreamland, peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200. In their live shows, they play re- worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. Their song \"Heat Waves\" reached number one in Australia in February 2021 and was voted number one on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020. The song surpassed one billion streams on Spotify. ==Other websites== *Official website ==References== Category:Indie rock bands Category:English rock bands Category:2010 establishments in England",
