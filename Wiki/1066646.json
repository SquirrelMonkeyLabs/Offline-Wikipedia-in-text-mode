 "text": "Manchester Arndale is a large shopping centre in the centre of Manchester, England. It was built between 1972 and 1979, at a cost of Â£100 million. It was the last of three local buildings designed by Wilson and Womersley architects, after Hulme Crescents and the Manchester Education Precinct. It was covered with yellow tiles. Manchester Arndale is the largest of the chain of Arndale Centres built across the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. It was redeveloped after the 1996 Manchester bombing. The centre has a retail floorspace of just under 1,400,000 sq ft (130,000 m2) (not including Selfridges and Marks and Spencer department stores to which it is connected by a link bridge). It ist Europe's third largest city-centre shopping mall. It is one of the largest in the UK, with about 41 million visitors a year, ahead of the Trafford Centre. There is a market which is owned and run by Manchester City Council. The rest of the centre is owned by M&G; Real Estate and run by CBRE Group. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Manchester Category:Malls",
