The album featured the singles \"Counterfeit\", \"Sour\", and a cover of George Michaels' song \"Faith\". Guitarist Wes Borland said in an interview that George Michael hated Limp Bizkit's cover and \"hates us for doing it\". The album had attracted controversy when Interscope Records paid a Portland, Oregon radio station $5,000 to play the single \"Counterfeit\" fifty times which attracted criticism of \"payola\" toward both the band and the label. ==Songs== ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:Limp Bizkit albums Category:Nu metal albums",
