 "text": "Encebollado is a fish stew from Ecuador, where it is a national dish. It is most popular in the coastal region. It is served with boiled cassava and pickled red onion rings. A dressing of onion is prepared with fresh tomato and spices such as pepper or coriander leaves. It is commonly prepared with albacore, but tuna, billfish, or bonito may also be used. It may be served with ripe avocado. Encebollado is usually served with banana chips, plantains, or bread as side dishes. Lime juice and chili sauce may be added. People in Ecuador eat it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Restaurants that sell only this dish start serving it in the early morning. ==References== ==Other websites== * Recipe by Layla Pujol Category:Ecuadorian food Category:Fish dishes",
