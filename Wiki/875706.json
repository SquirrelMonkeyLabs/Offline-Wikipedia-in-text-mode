Subor was known for making a clone of the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System), known as the Subor Video Game System. The device was called educational because some people don't like the idea of using the device for recreational reasons. Jackie Chan is a spokesperson for the company. The console was popular in the 1980s and 1990s. It was a reason for a ban on console games from 2000 to 2015. The company later specialized in other electronic products, such as dictionaries. In 2018, the company demonstrated a new video game system, the Subor Z+. It also invested money into virtual reality devices. In 2019, Karen Chiu said that Chinese people who played video games as children had nostalgia for the Subor Video Game System that is similar to the nostalgia in Western countries for the actual consoles. The company went bankrupt in 2020 for a \"high consumption\" of a some people from the company's head office. == References == Category:Video game companies of China Category:Electronics companies of China",
