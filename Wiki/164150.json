 "text": "Stalinism refers to the political system under Joseph Stalin, including ideology and state administration. A secret history of those days is contained in the Mitrokhin Archives. Stalinism involves using strong state leadership and suppression of opposition to quickly develop a country. Lazar Kaganovich, a Soviet politician, coined the term.Stalinism existed in the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1956. The Soviet Union was an agricultural country in 1924, but by 1956 it was a powerful industrial country with good living standards. This happened because of the 5-year plans of the government. These plans contained all economic development to happen in the 5 years.The controversial part of Stalinism is that to do all these things, the government detained or killed many people who didn't like the government. A few hundred thousand people were detained or killed. Stalinism also inspired Maoism in China (under Mao) and Juche North Korea (under Kim Il Sung,Kim Jong-il) including Hoxhaism in Albania (under Enver Hoxha) including Pol Pot’s National Communist Movement in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge as well as Nicolae Ceaușescu In Romania but it also inspired Nazbolism in Equatorial Guinea under Francisco Macías Nguema who called himself a Marxist-Hitlerist .
