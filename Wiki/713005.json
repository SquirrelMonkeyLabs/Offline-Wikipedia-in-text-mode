 "text": "Operation Meetinghouse was a bombing attack by the United States against Japan on the night between the 9th and 10th of March 1945. American bombers dropped firebombs without a specific target on the Japanese city of Tokyo. These firebombs created a huge firestorm which killed over 100,000 people and destroyed the homes of about 1 million more people. It is notable for being the most deadly attack from the air in world history. The attack was a change in strategy for the United States, which had previously only attacked from the air during the day, focusing on specific buildings. == References == Category:1945 in Japan Category:20th century in Tokyo Category:World War II",
