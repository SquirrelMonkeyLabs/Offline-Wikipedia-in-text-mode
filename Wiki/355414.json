 "text": "Benjamin Morrell, (July 5, 1795 â€“ 1839) was an American sea captain, navigator and explorer. Between 1821 and 1823, he made four important trips, especially in the Southern Ocean, the Pacific Islands and the eastern shores of the Americas. He wrote a memoir about his travels titled \"A Narrative of Four Voyages\" and, following the information provided, earned a bad reputation as a liar, because it contained inaccuracies and also contained a somewhat fanciful way of exposing their experiences.
