 "text": "Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen (), under his game development company dotGears. Flappy Bird was released on May 24, 2013. The game also generated some criticism because of the similarities it had with popular videogame franchise Mario, the one by which Flappy Bird was accused of plagiarism and lack of originality. ==Gameplay== The point of the game is for the titular bird to fly between columns of green pipes with the player controlling the bird making it fly higher. ==Removal and new version== On Valentine's Day 2014, Nguyen announced on Twitter that he was going to remove the game from app stores. This was because he became too guilty that the game had been seen as an addiction. In September 2024, it was announced that a new version was being made by Gametech Holdings, under the name \"The Flappy Bird Foundation\". ==References== Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Fictional birds Category:IOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Single-player video games",
