Mundi can fix what he breaks. * Anabella (voiced by Katie Grant) is a hot pink flamingo, and the innocent, playful and loving little sister of the group. Always very happy, playful and loving, she tends to daydream a lot and can easily get distracted by anything beautiful or unusual. She is deeply sensitive, and she often expresses how she feels by dancing. Anabella is very cute and has a free spirit, and is open and very adventurous. * Gabi (voiced by Sarah Sheppard) is a bright, energetic, and precocious goat who is the most grown-up of the group and often uses complex words that the team doesn't always understand. She has a great sense of humour and is very brave, loyal, stubborn when necessary, and very competitive. Despite her obvious maturity, Gabi hides a weakness; a tendency to believe that she is the smartest of the group, appearing insensitive to the feelings of others and her great heart the salvation of all complicated situations. She has a pet worm named Lancelot. * Fico (voiced by Lucas Kalechstein in seasons 1–2 and Roman Lutterotti in season 3) is a blue otter, and the silly one of the group who is always happy and known for being quite funny, affectionate, and impulsive.
