 "text": "Gandhara art or Gandharan art, also known as Greco-Buddhist art, is a blend of Ancient Greek and Buddhist influences that developed mainly in the northwestern regions of Pakistan in the ancient region of Gandhara. It had influences throughout Central, East and Southeast Asia. The first sculpture of Gautama Buddha in human form was created in this region. The Seated Buddha from Gandhara is the oldest surviving statue of Buddha in the world. The Gandharan art began with interactions sparked by Alexander the Great's presence and flourished under the Kushan Empire during the 1st-3rd centuries CE. The Gandhara art reached its peak from the 3rd-5th century CE. Gandhara art features Buddhist themes with a touch of Greco-Roman elements, showcasing a style influenced by Hellenistic art. Notably, it produced the earliest surviving images of Buddha in human form, marking the end of early aniconism (representing Buddha only with symbols) in Buddhism. The realistic portrayal of the human form in large sculptures had a significant impact, spreading Buddhist influence to neighbouring India, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan and as far east as China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea. == References == Category:Gandhara Category:History of Pakistan Category:Ancient history of Pakistan Category:Ancient culture of Pakistan Category:Greek culture",
