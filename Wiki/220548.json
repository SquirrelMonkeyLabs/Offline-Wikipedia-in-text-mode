 "text": "Coconut milk is a sweet, milky white liquid for cooking. It comes from the meat of a mature coconut. The color and rich taste of the milk are because of the high oil content and sugars. It is different from coconut water (coconut juice), which is the natural liquid found inside a coconut. Coconut milk is used in many tropical recipes. There are two kinds of coconut milk: thick and thin. == References == Category:Plant milks Category:Coconuts",
