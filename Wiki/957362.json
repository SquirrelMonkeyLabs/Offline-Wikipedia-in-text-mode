 "text": "Period 8 elements are hypothetical elements heavier than oganesson. They include atomic numbers 119 to 153. It is very likely that they do not exist in nature, and can only be made as synthetic elements. No period 8 elements have been made. If a period 8 element were discovered or made, it would add a new row to the periodic table. Period 8 would be the first period to include g-block elements, with the 5g atomic orbital being filled in unbiunium. The 5g and 6f elements can be grouped together as the superactinides. Most period 8 elements are predicted to be too unstable to make or study. They will go through radioactive decay or nuclear fission very quickly. However, period 8 includes the predicted island of stability, which may allow the study of some period 8 elements. ==References== Category:Hypothetical chemical elements",
