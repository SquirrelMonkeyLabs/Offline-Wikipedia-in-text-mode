He first became widely known in the 1990s, when he appeared in a wide variety of television programs, films, and musical albums. He was a fixture on the Atlanta and New York City gay club scenes during the 1980s and early 1990s. On occasion, RuPaul has performed as a man in a number of roles. He is usually billed as RuPaul Charles. RuPaul is noted among famous drag queens for his indifference towards the gender-specific pronouns used to address him. He said: \"You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just as long as you call me.\" He hosted a short- running talk show on VH1. He has hosted reality television shows called RuPaul's Drag Race and RuPaul's Drag U. In 2020, he learned that he and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker are cousins; they discovered it by appearing on the TV show Finding Your Roots. == References == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from San Diego Category:Singers from San Diego Category:Writers from San Diego Category:African-American actors Category:African-American singers Category:African-American television personalities Category:African-American writers Category:American television presenters Category:Drag queens Category:LGBT actors Category:LGBT African- Americans Category:LGBT models Category:LGBT people from California Category:LGBT singers Category:LGBT songwriters Category:American LGBT writers Category:Gay men Category:Models from San Diego Category:Musicians from San Diego Category:Singer-songwriters from California Category:Writers from California Category:American bloggers",
