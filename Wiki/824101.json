 "text": "A geographical indication associates a product with a certain geographical area. The buyer of the product will then know that the product is from the area indicated. These indications are most common for agricultural products, mostly food. They can also be found for industrial products. In theory, they could also apply to services. In the European Union, and probably elsewhere, a protected designation of origin also means that the product has been produced according to certain rules, and that certain standards are met.
