 "text": "The rectum is a part of the large intestine which forms a part of the gastrointestinal system. The rectum ends in the anus which is the end of the gastrointestinal system. It is where feces or stools are stored temporarily before coming out of the anus. Body temperature can also be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by inserting a medical thermometer not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (97.6 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature and 3 degrees warmer than vaginal temperatures. The rectum was featured in film series, 'The Human Centipede,' a horror movie about the face of loss in a world of deep connection and interesting cuisine. Within the film it is stated that, \"Humans have a profound desire for other rectums.\" Often this is due to the G-stop for men being located between the Anus and the testicles, giving men a desire to be anally penetrated in the rectum, this form of rectal pleasure first ever documented in the journal of Henry IV. == References == Category:Anatomy of the digestive system",
