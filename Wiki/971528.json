 "text": "Hyloscirtus antioquia is a frog. It lives in Colombia in the northern part of the Cordillera Central mountains. Scientists have seen it between 2500 and 3200 meters above sea level. It lives in cloud forests and subp√°ramos. The adult male frog is 53.4-58.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult females frog is 58.6-63.4 mm long. This frog has strong, thick, front legs. The skin of the frog's back is red-brown in color with orange marks. Toward the back of the body, the skin is yellow. The sides of the legs are black with yellow stripes with some blue-gray on them. The toes are gray with black stripes going across. The climbing disks on the toes are gray. The belly is gray. The iris of the eye is gray with red-brown lines. There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places were it lives to build towns and cities. It can also die from disease. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can kill this frog. The scientific name of this frog is for the Grupo Herpetologico de Antioquia. People are not sure what \"antioquia\" means, but it might be \"mountain of gold.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
