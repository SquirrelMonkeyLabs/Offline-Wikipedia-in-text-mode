 "text": "The Castelli Romani (\"Roman Castles\") refers to a group of picturesque hill towns located in the Alban Hills, southeast of Rome in the region of Lazio, Italy. Known for their scenic landscapes, historical significance, and culinary traditions, the Castelli Romani towns have long been a favorite retreat for Romans looking to escape the heat and bustle of the city. Today, the area is popular with both local and international tourists for its rich cultural heritage, wines, and festivals. == Geography == The Castelli Romani area is situated on the slopes of the volcanic Alban Hills, an ancient volcanic complex. The area is dotted with small towns and lakes, including Lake Albano and Lake Nemi, which are remnants of volcanic craters. The region's elevation and fertile volcanic soil make it suitable for vineyards, olive groves, and orchards, contributing to its reputation for high-quality wine and food. == History == The Castelli Romani towns have ancient origins, with settlements dating back to the Latins, the early Italic tribes who were later incorporated into the Roman Republic. The area was historically significant as the center of the Latin League and the location of religious festivals dedicated to Jupiter at Monte Cavo. Over the centuries, the Alban Hills became a retreat for Roman elites, who built villas and estates there. During the Middle Ages, many of these towns were fortified by noble families and came to be known as \"castelli\" (castles), a term that reflects their defensive structures. By the Renaissance, these towns became popular among wealthy Romans and popes, who established summer residences there to escape the hot climate of Rome. == Wine and cuisine == The Castelli Romani area is renowned for its culinary traditions and winemaking, particularly the production of white wines such as Frascati. The area's volcanic soil and temperate climate make it ideal for vineyards, producing wines that are enjoyed both locally and abroad. Many towns hold annual food festivals celebrating local products, with Marino's famous grape festival drawing large crowds each October. == Tourism and culture == The Castelli Romani has long been a popular tourist destination for its natural beauty, historical sites, and culinary offerings. The area features numerous trails, parks, and cultural events, including the Sagra dellâ€™Uva (Grape Festival) in Marino, the Infiorata flower festival in Genzano, and many religious celebrations. The Regional Park of the Castelli Romani was established to protect the natural environment, preserving both the forests and traditional agricultural landscapes. == Related pages == * Alban Hills * Latium == References == Category:Towns in Italy",
