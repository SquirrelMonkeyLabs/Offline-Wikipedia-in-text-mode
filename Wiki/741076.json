He is currently in the boyband JLS, runners-up of the fifth series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom. Whilst Oritse lived in Nigeria he loved being involved with his community and most of all singing with the villagers. After two years he moved back to the UK to live back with his mother in London. Oritse worked at a record company for free in order to gain music industry experience. He was introduced to a variety of different mentors when he joined a vocal academy whilst he was studying at uni. After coming back from Nigeria he decided to leave the music idea behind and went to uni to study Events Management. It was when his mother's condition worsened (she was diagnosed with Multiple Serocis when he was 15) and he wanted to raise some money to support hi family. He decided to advertise for his \"Super Group\". He soon was introduced to Marvin Humes who then introduced Aston Merrygold to the band who Marvin knew from auditions. During the series 4 additions for the X factor, Oritse was looking for the forth and final member of his band (JLS). He went to see if he could find anyone at the X Factor auditions and spoke to a music scouting agency there and they gave Oritse JB Gill's details. == References == Category:1986 births Category:British R&B; musicians Category:English pop singers Category:English songwriters Category:Black British musicians Category:Hip hop musicians Category:Musicians from London Category:Living people Category:English musicians",
