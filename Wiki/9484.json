 "text": "In Europe in the 16th century, there was a big change in the Christian religion. During the Protestant Reformation, hundreds of thousands of people left the Catholic Church to form Protestant churches all over Europe. \"The Five solas\" are an important part of reformed theology for the Protestant leaders: * Sola scriptura (meaning \"The Bible only\"): Protestants believe that they need only to read the Bible to find out what God wants, instead of listening to the Pope or the Catholic Church. * Solus Christus (meaning Christ only\"): Protestants believe that the only way to heaven is by Jesus dying on the cross, thus they do not have to pray to Mary, saints, or angels. * Sola Gratia (meaning \"grace only:\" Protestants believe that God lets people into heaven, but no one deserves it. *Sola fide (meaning \"faith only\"): Protestants believe that people must trust Jesus for him to let them into heaven. *Soli Deo Gloria (meaning \"only glory to God\"): Protestants believe that God alone should be worshipped, not the Pope or priests, and people should not trust the Church to get to heaven. The words \"Sola Scriptura\", \"Solus Christus\", \"Sola Gratia\", \"Sola Fide\" and \"Soli Deo Gloria\" are in Latin. == Other websites == *Articles on the Five Solas—from a conservative Calvinistic perspective *FiveSolas.com—a Reformed page devoted to the Solas Category:Protestant theology Category:Protestant Reformation",
