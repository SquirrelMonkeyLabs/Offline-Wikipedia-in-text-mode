 "text": "Gulliver's Travels is a book written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift. It is a satire about human nature—how humans act—and was very popular. It is about a man named Gulliver who goes to four places. The first has very tiny people that are less than 6 inches tall, the second has very tall people, the third is a floating island with people obsessed with science, and the fourth has savage humans and talking, wise horses. The book was an immediate success. John Gay said that \"it is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery\".https://walleahpress.com.au/communion8-John-Gay.html == References == Category:18th-century books Category:British novels Category:1720s works",
