 "text": "Hammer and sickle are symbols that have generally been associated with communism. The hammer is a symbol for work done in industry, the sickle stands for work done in agriculture. Several countries have made the use of these symbols illegal, when they outlawed the communist party. These countries include Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. However, some countries (especially communist ones) still commonly use the symbol, such as Angola in its flag, the flags of some cities in Russia (a former Soviet state), and China, Vietnam and Laos in the logos of their respective dominant political parties, for example. ==Gallery== File:Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, Logo um 1920.svg|The logo of the Communist party of Germany was made in 1918. It shows both the hammer and the sickle. The party itself was active from 1918 to 1956, when it was banned. The filled red star is another symbol for communism.
