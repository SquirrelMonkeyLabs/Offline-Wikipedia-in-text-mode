It is otherwise known as an 'open heart procedure', taking several hours to accomplish. The first heart transplant on a human was done by Christiaan Barnard on Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old with both diabetes and incurable heart disease at the time. This procedure was carried out on Sunday 3rd December 1967. == Related pages == * Gastric bypass surgery * Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) ==References== == Other websites == * Heart transplant website built by heart transplant patient, John Fisher Category:Surgery Category:Heart Category:Transplants Category:Cardiology Category:Medical procedures",
