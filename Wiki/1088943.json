 "text": "Hypsocormus (from Greek: ῠ̔́ψος húpsos, 'height' and Greek: κορμός kormós 'timber log') is a genus of pachycormiform from the Jurassic with fossils being found in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The two species are H. insignis and H. posterodorsalis. == Description == Hypsocormus was about 1 m (3.3 ft) long, with a caudal fin just like a mackerel. It had a dorsal fin, long pectoral fins and tiny pelvic fins. == Classification == === Discovery === In 1860, Johann Andreas Wagner discovered the type species, H. insignis. The species was then placed into this genus. For a long time, it has been considered to be the only species of Hypsocormus. However, in 2020, Maxwell and others described a new species, H. posterodorsalis. There are currently two species in this genus. === Species === * †Hypsocormus insignis Wagner, 1860 (type species) * †Hypsocormus posterodorsalis Maxwell et al. 2020 == Image gallery == == Related pages == * Ohmdenia * Synapturanus zombie * Pseudoasthenocormus == References == # \"Hypsocormus\" .
