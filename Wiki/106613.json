 "text": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA) on the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 titles. He is married to Savannah James. He has 3 children. They are Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James. He is also a film producer and a business man. Among the best basketball players of the twenty-first century, he has a lot of experience. Both Space Jam: A New Legacy and Trainwreck featured him as himself. He is the proprietor of the SpringHill Company. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio. The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft, not only for his athletic ability but for the revenue he could bring to the team and city. James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was one of the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals. He was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for the 2008-09 NBA season and 2009-10 NBA season. On July 8, 2010, on a show in ESPN called \"The Decision\" King James said that he would next play for the Miami Heat. On December 2, 2010, King James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving, scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers, 118-90. Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James. In the 2011 season the Miami Heat had the second-best record right behind the Chicago Bulls lead by Derrick Rose in the NBA. They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks This caused celebration in Cleveland because they hated LeBron for what he did to them. In the 2012 Finals, King LeBron James S won his first championship after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 games, after battling with the Boston Celtics 4-3 games the previous round. The next year, LeBron James won his second title when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. In both years he won the MVP title of finals and of regular season. In 2014, King James competed a good season but he wasn't the MVP. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat's Finals streak ended after being defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games (4-1). Shortly after those Finals had ended, King LeBron James said he would use an early termination option in his contract, leaving the Miami Heat and becoming a free agent. He said this on June 24, 2014. Then, on June 25, 2014, in a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated, he said he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On July 12, 2014, James signed a two-year, $42.2 million contract to return to the Cavaliers. The deal also contains an option to become a free agent again after the 2014â€“15 NBA season. LeBron now plays on the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2015, he took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, without Kevin Love but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games after losing Kyrie Irving after he had an ankle injury. He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship after being down 3-1 games to their first- ever title in 2016 and later played a crucial role in bringing glory to the Los Angeles Lakers. No team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals before. He had a historic moment where he blocked Andre Iguodala on possibly the game winning layup. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Golden State Warriors the following season. Now with the Lakers he passed Kobe Bryant. On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal. The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings. In 2021, James starred in Space Jam: A New Legacy where he played a version of himself. LeBron is widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time, as well as one of the most influential athletes and sports players in the world. == Awards == On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387-point total during a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Currently, LeBron is staying at 41,243, which is 2856 higher than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was the youngest player to reach this point. He is also well known for his assists, and with 11,318, he is now the player with the fourth-most assistances. James and Michael Jordan are the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA title, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The USA would go on to win the Olympics twice. == Job as a Business == Since even before he made his NBA debut, James has been associated with Nike. They In 2003, he agreed to a seven-year contract with the business that was worth little under $90 million. Many people at the time questioned whether Nike put a little too much faith in an 18-year-old who had never played a professional game. LeBron became one of the biggest players in the NBA and a four-time MVP as a result of the risk, which paid off brilliantly. James has been a success for Nike off the court as well, in addition to on it. Until now the sales of his signature sneaker reached $340 million between February 2014 and January 2015, making him the highest-paid employee at the company. ==References== == Other websites == * LeBron James' Official website * Lebron James Fansite * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Akron, Ohio Category:Actors from Los Angeles Category:African-American basketball players Category:African-American movie producers Category:American basketball players Category:American billionaires Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles Category:Businesspeople from Ohio Category:Cleveland Cavaliers players Category:Los Angeles Lakers players Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2024 Summer Olympics Category:Miami Heat players Category:Movie producers from Los Angeles Category:Movie producers from Ohio Category:National Basketball Association high school draftees Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States Category:Philanthropists from California Category:Philanthropists from Ohio Category:Podcasters Category:Power forwards Category:Small forwards Category:Space Jam characters Category:Sports movie characters Category:Sportspeople from Akron, Ohio Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles",
