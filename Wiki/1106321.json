Rangel, with the decree Number 106. ==History== This flag made its debut on December 20, 1928 in the city of Cali, in Colombia. This happened within the framework of the inauguration of the First National Olympic Games. On this occasion the flag bearer was Néstor Perozo, accompanied by other footballers from Cúcuta Deportivo F.C. This flag caused a great commotion at its inauguration. This happened because people believed that this banner was carried as a form of protest. ==Related pages== * Cúcuta ==References== Cúcuta Category:Flags with coats of arms",
