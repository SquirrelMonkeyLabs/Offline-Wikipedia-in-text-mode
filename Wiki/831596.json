 "text": "The Ceann Comhairle is part of the government of Ireland. The Ceann Comhairle is the speaker of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas. This is the same job as Speaker of the House in other countries. Until 2020, a newly elected Dáil would choose the Ceann Comhairle (Speaker/Chairperson), but starting in 2020, the Ceann Comhairle was elected by secret ballot. The Ceann Comhairle must be impartial during the daily business and proceedings of the House. The Standing Orders (rules) of Dáil Éireann say all the powers and duties of the Ceann Comhairle for parliamentary business, e.g. the proper conduct of debate, parliamentary questions, amendments to Bills and motions, disorderly conduct. ==References== Category:Government ministers of Ireland",
