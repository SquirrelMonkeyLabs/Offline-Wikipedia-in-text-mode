 "text": "Unreachable code is a section of code in a program that can never be executed. Having unreachable code is bad because it wastes space on the disk, memory, and CPU cache. Luckily, many modern compilers alert the programmer with a warning or error whenever it detects unreachable code. == Example == void beepForever() { while (true) { System.out.println(\"Beep!\"); } System.out.println(\":'(\"); } In this example, `\":'(\"` will never be printed because the loop never exits.
