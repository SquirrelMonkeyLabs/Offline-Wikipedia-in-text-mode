 "text": "Cult is a term that describes some new religious movements and other social groups which have unusual (and often extreme) religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs and rituals. Cults have specific characteristics, like extreme devotion to a particular person, object, or goal. The term has different definitions in academia and popular culture. Sometimes it is used in a pejorative way. New Age religions were often called cults because they were thought to be deviant social movements.OED, citing American Journal of Sociology 85, 1980, 1377: \"Cults[...], like other deviant social movements, tend to recruit people with a grievance, people who suffer from a some variety of deprivation\". == Definition == The word cult originally meant a system of ritual practices. It was first used in the early 17th century to mean respect paid to a divinity.Its root was the Latin cultus, meaning \"worship\", ultimately from colere, to \"tend\" or take care of something for example a shrine. It came from the ancient Latin word cultus, meaning \"worship\". Many (but not all) cults are small, newly started religious movements. These are not mainstream religions; they are groups set up to oppose \"a centre of established authority\". Historically, many cults have had leaders who were not elected and control the group according to their own wishes.See testimony of John G. Clark Jnr. M.D. to the Vermont legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives: It can be difficult to say whether a religious group is a cult. A group that is considered a cult today may be accepted as a religion in the future. Likewise, a religion that is accepted today may later become a cult. === Destructive cults === Leaders of some destructive cults have been dangerous criminals (like Charles Manson and Jim Jones). Murders have occurred in some cults (like the Order of the Solar Temple and Heaven's Gate). Armed guards carrying submachine guns enforced mass \"suicides\" among Jones's Peoples Temple and the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God. == Treatment of cult members == === Mind control === Cults use some form of persuasion or mind control to recruit and keep members. After studying cult members, psychiatrist Dr. John G. Clark testified that cults use \"coercive persuasion and thought reform techniques ... on naïve, uninformed [people] with disastrous health consequences.\" Their goal is to prevent the faithful from thinking critically and making choices in their own best interests. Many cults use the following methods:Bullock, Alan & Trombley, Stephen (eds) 1999. The new Fontana dictionary of modern thought. London: Fontana, p189. House, Wayne 2000. Charts of cults, sects, and religious movements. Tourish, Dennis 2000. On the edge: political cults right and left. # They put a person in physically or emotionally distressing situations; # They repeatedly tell the person their problems have one simple explanation; # A charismatic leader or group gives the person what seems to be unconditional love, acceptance, and attention # The person gets a new identity based on the group; # The person is subject to entrapment (isolation from friends, relatives and the mainstream culture) and their access to information is severely controlled.Esquerre, Arnaud 2009. La manipulation mentale. Sociologie des sectes en France. Fayard, Paris.Hassan, Steve 1990. Combatting cult mind control. Park Street Press. Some disagree that using these methods makes a group a cult.James, Gene G. 1986. Brainwashing: the myth and the actuality. Fordham University Quarterly, vol 61, June. The Society for the Scientific Study of Religion stated in 1990 that there was not enough research for a consensus. They said \"the techniques involved in the process of physical coercion\" were not necessarily the same as the techniques of \"nonphysical coercion and control\". === Management style === Cults have often been criticized for having a dictatorial and exploitative managerial style. In his testimony, Dr. Clark said: > The beliefs of all these cults are absolutist and non-tolerant of other > systems of beliefs. Their systems of governance are totalitarian. A > requirement of membership is to obey absolutely without questioning. Their > interest in the individual’s development within the cult towards some kind > of satisfactory individual adult personality is[,] by their doctrines, very > low or nonexistent. It is clear that almost all of them emphasize money- > making in one form or another, although a few seem to be very much involved > in demeaning or self denigrating activities and rituals. Most of them that I > have studied possess a good deal of property and money which is under the > discretionary control of the individual leaders. == Violent cults == Some cults have collected weapons and committed acts of violence. For example, in 1971, members of the Manson Family were convicted of several murders.Bugliosi, Vincent with Curt Gentry. 1974. Helter skelter: the true story of the Manson murders. Arrow Books, 1992 ed: ; W.W. Norton, 2001 ed: In 1978, armed cult members from the People's Temple killed a visiting United States Congressman, Leo Ryan. Armed with submachine guns, they stood around as over 900 believers committed mass suicide.Reiterman, Tom; Jacobs, John 1982. Raven: the untold story of Rev. Jim Jones and his people. Dutton, In 1993 the Branch Davidians, under the direction of David Koresh, used violence against federal law enforcement agencies. A later FBI report revealed how large the cult's collection of weapons had become.FBI 2000. Project Megiddo, pages 10 and 26. United States Department of Justice, Operation Megiddo, November 2, 1999. A strategic assessment of the potential for domestic terrorism in the United States undertaken in anticipation of, or response to, the arrival of the new millennium. The 51-day siege by the ATF, FBI, and the Texas National Guard resulted in the deaths of four ATF agents, Koresh, and 82 other Branch Davidian men, women, and children. In 1995, members of a doomsday cult called Aum Shinrikyo (“Supreme Truth”) released sarin, a poisonous nerve gas, on five crowded subway trains during morning rush hour in Tokyo. Thirteen people were killed and thousands more were sickened. == Related pages == *Sect *Religion == References == == Further reading == *Jenkins, Philip 2000.
