 "text": "The 1997 Jarrell F5 tornado ravaged the area of Jarrell, Texas, as well as the Double Creek area west of Jarrell. The storm hit on May 27, 1997. It lasted for 19 minutes, and was very unusual. It came from a bizarre supercell that moved southwest ward instead of the normal northeast ward direction. Additionally, it was very slow, as it if stopped to make sure it destroyed everything in its path. It was very bad. It is infamous for the picture taken by a guy observing the storm, who took the photo known as the “Dead Man Walking”. This is because it had multiple vortices, giving the illusion it was walking.
