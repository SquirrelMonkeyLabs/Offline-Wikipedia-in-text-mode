 "text": "A cubicle is a small room. It can be a small work space often seen in offices as well as places used for changing clothes in, often found at swimming pools and gymnasiums. Cubicles can also be used as toilets, which is an enclosed area containing a toilet seat. ==History== Robert Propst designed the first cubicle in 1964. He wanted to \"empower\" people, and make them work better. Propst worked for a home furnishings company called Herman Miller at the time. In 1968, when the company started selling the cubicle, it did not sell well. Herman Miller later designed a new type of cubicle that was cheaper. The cubicle is now very popular in offices around the world. ==Types of cubicles== ===Office use=== The cubicles in the office consist of walls, work surfaces, overhead bins, drawers, and shelving units. ===Toilet use=== The cubicles in the toilet consist of toilet partitions, toilet roll holder with toilet roll, toilet seat, toilet cubicle door with toilet cubicle door lock. The toilet cubicle door lock consists of two indicators: green means vacant if a person is free and red means engaged if a person is sitting on the toilet seat while following the toilet hygiene regulations. ==References== Category:Rooms",
