 "text": "A cuboid is a 3D shape. Cuboids have six faces. These faces form a convex polyhedron. The faces of the cuboid can be any quadrilateral. The most common cuboid is the rectangular cuboid. It is made from 6 rectangles that are placed at right angles to each other. A cuboid that uses all square faces is a cube. The cuboid can also be called a right rectangular prism. == Properties == The properties of a cuboid include: * cuboids have 12 edges * They have 8 corners or vertices * They have 6 faces. Symmetry group D2h, [2,2], (*222), ord symbol { } × { } × { } The difference between a rectangle and a cuboid is that a rectangle is a 2D shape and a cuboid is a 3D shape. A cube is a cuboid where all six faces have the same height and widths. Each face of a cube is a square. Where L= length, w= width and h= height: * Total Surface Area of Cuboid = 2( (L×w) + (w×h) + (h×L) ) * Volume of Cuboid = L * w * h Category:Polyhedra",
