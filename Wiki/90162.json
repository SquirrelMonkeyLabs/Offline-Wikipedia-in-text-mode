At the University of North Texas, his dissertation was titled \"Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Psychological Intervention.\" ==Career== After obtaining his Ph.D., McGraw joined his father, Dr. Joe McGraw, in Wichita Falls, Texas, where the elder McGraw had a private psychology practice. In 1983, McGraw and his father joined Thelma Box, a successful Texas businesswoman, in presenting \"Pathways\" seminars, \"an experience-based training which allows individuals to achieve and create their own results.\" In 1990, McGraw joined lawyer Gary Dobbs in co- founding Courtroom Sciences Inc.

After starting CSI, McGraw ceased the practice of psychology. ===Oprah Winfrey and the Dr. Phil show=== In 1995, Oprah Winfrey hired McGraw's legal consulting firm CSI to prepare her for the Amarillo Texas beef trial. Winfrey was so impressed with McGraw that she thanked him for her victory in that case, which ended in 1998. Soon after, she invited him to appear on her show. His appearance proved so successful that he began appearing weekly as a \"Relationship and Life Strategy Expert\" on Tuesdays starting in April 1998. The next year, McGraw published his first best-selling book, Life Strategies, some of which was taken from the \"Pathways\" seminar. In the next four years, McGraw published three additional best-selling relationship books, along with workbooks to complement them. As of September 2002, McGraw formed Peteski Productions and launched his own syndicated daily television show, Dr. Phil, produced by Winfrey's Harpo Studios. The format is an advice show, where he tackles a different topic on each show, offering advice for his guests' troubles. ===Weight loss products=== In 2003 Dr Phil started selling weight loss products. They were called, \"Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!\" McGraw said science showed they could help users control their weight. Many people criticized this and the Federal Trade Commission investigated. McGraw stopped selling weight loss products in March 2004 In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products said they would file a class action lawsuit against him because although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not cause weight loss. McGraw paid $10.5 million in September 2006 to stop the lawsuit. ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Filmography== * The Devil and Dr. Phil an episode of Frasier (2003) * Scary Movie 4 (2006) * Treehouse of Horror XVII an episode of The Simpsons (2006) * Madea Goes to Jail (2009) * Hannah Montana (1 episode, 2010) * Latest Episodes == References == == Other websites== * Dr. Phil (official site) * Dr. Phil Latest Full Episodes * Official Biography * * 2003 interview with University of North Texas alumni magazine * Dallas Observer article details much of Dr. Phil's life, including many critical views. * Scholarly article in which authors claim that the narrative arc of Dr. Phil's show is comparable to the religious conversion story *Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists, Disciplinary Sanctions against McGraw, Philip C. detailed on page 25/41 Category:American television presenters Category:American psychologists Category:Scientists from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Writers from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Scientists from Oklahoma Category:Writers from Oklahoma Category:1950 births Category:Living people",
