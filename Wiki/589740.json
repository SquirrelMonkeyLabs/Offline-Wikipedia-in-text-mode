 "text": "A marriage proposal is when one person in a relationship asks the other person to marry them. If the other person agrees, this marks the start of the couple's engagement. A person in an engaged couple is called \"fiance\" (male) or \"fiancee\" (female). In Western culture, it is traditional for the person proposing to be down on one bent knee. A traditional proposal might be worded \"Will you marry me?\" In many cultures, it is traditional for a man to ask a woman's father for permission to marry her. The father could say no if he thought the man was not right for his daughter, or if he didn't want him as a son-in-law. In the West today, it is more common for a couple to decide between themselves and then announce their decision to their parents. Instead of asking for permission, the couple may ask for the parents' approval or their blessing. In some cultures, marriage proposals involve unique traditions or customs. For example, in Sri Lanka, some couples incorporate traditional Sinhalese customs into their proposals. These may include exchanging betel leaves or presenting the bride-to-be with jewelry. Modern Sri Lankan couples also blend Western and traditional practices, sometimes using online resources to plan culturally meaningful proposals. In the United States, about 5% of proposals are performed by women. ==References== category:marriage",
