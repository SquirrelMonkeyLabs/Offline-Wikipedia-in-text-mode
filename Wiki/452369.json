 "text": "An assisted living residence is a popular housing alternative for people with disabilities or for adults (especially the elderly) who cannot live independently. These homes give help or supervision with daily living activities. They also allow services by outside health care providers. They check residents and resident activities to make sure health, safety and well being are maintained. Assistance may include the giving or supervision of medicine or personal care services. \"The philosophy of assisted living is to treat all residents with dignity; to give privacy and to encourage independence.\" The gradual shift to assisted living began between 1979 and 1985 in the United States. A variation on assisted living for children and younger adults is the Group home. == References == ==Other websites== *Assisted Living Directory *Assisted Living Online Finder Category:Accommodations Category:Social care Category:Disability",
