The Ministry of Education oversees the development and administration of state schools and has only a supervisory role for private schools. In Singapore, education covers 20 percent of the annual national budget. State and government-assisted private schools are subsidized for Singapore citizens and the Edusave program. Foreigners enrolling in Singapore schools pay higher study fees in both types of institutions. In 2000, the government made enrolling children in schools mandatory based on the Compulsory Education Act. The inability to enroll the children in school becomes a criminal offense for the parents. Exemptions are only for homeschooling and full-time religious school. The exemption must be applied by parents from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark. English is used as the main language for the education system in Singapore. It is the first language that will be taught to children from preschool in Singapore.
