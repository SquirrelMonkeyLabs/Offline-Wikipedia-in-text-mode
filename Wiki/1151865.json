 "text": "Vahan's War was a rebellion in 481–484 CE led by Vahan I Mamikonian against the Sasanian Empire. The war was a response to Persian policies enforcing Zoroastrianism and cultural assimilation in Armenia. The rebellion ended with the Treaty of Nvarsak, which granted Armenians religious freedom and some political autonomy. == Background == * Persian Domination: Following the collapse of the Armenian Kingdom in 428 CE, Armenia became a Marzpanate, ruled by Persian-appointed governors. The Sasanians pressured Armenians to convert to Zoroastrianism, leading to resistance from Armenian nobles and clergy. * Vahan Mamikonian’s Role: Vahan, a member of the influential Mamikonian family, became the leader of the rebellion. His uncle, Vardan Mamikonian, had previously led the famous Battle of Avarayr (451 CE) against Persian forces. == Key Battles == * Battle of Nersehapat (482): The Armenian forces, under Vahan’s leadership, defeated the Persians, marking a turning point in the rebellion. * Battle of Akori and other clashes: Throughout 482–483, additional battles took place in regions like Akori and Charmana, where Armenian forces maintained their resistance. == Outcome == The rebellion ended in 484 with the Treaty of Nvarsak, negotiated after the death of Persian King Peroz I. This treaty ensured: * Armenians’ right to practice Christianity freely. * A degree of autonomy for Armenian nobles. == Legacy == Vahan’s War reinforced the Armenian people’s commitment to Christianity and their resistance to foreign domination. Vahan Mamikonian is celebrated as a national hero for securing religious freedom and preserving Armenian identity. Category:Vahan War Category:Wars of Sasanian Persia",
