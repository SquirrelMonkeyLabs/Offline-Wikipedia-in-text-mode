 "text": "A supercharger is a device that forces more air into an internal combustion engine. This gives the engine more oxygen to burn fuel, which makes the engine more powerful. Superchargers are powered by the engine itself, usually through a belt connected to the crankshaft. This is different from a turbocharger, which is powered by the engine's exhaust gases. Superchargers have been used since the early days of engines. They were first built in 1878. In the early 20th century, they were used a lot in aircraft engines. They helped engines work better at high altitudes, where the air is thinner. In the 1920s, superchargers started being used in car engines too. There are two main types of superchargers: 1\\. Positive displacement superchargers: These use spinning rotors to push air into the engine. The most common types are Roots and twin- screw superchargers. 2\\. Dynamic superchargers: These use a fast-spinning impeller to draw air into the engine. The most common type is the centrifugal supercharger. Superchargers can make an engine much more powerful, but they also use more fuel. They were very popular in high-performance vehicles for many years. However, in recent times, many manufacturers have switched to using turbochargers instead. Turbochargers are more fuel-efficient and can produce more power. Despite being less common now, superchargers are still used in some cars, trucks, and aircraft. They remain an important part of the history of engine technology. Category:Technology",
