 "text": "Paddlefish are a family of ray-finned fish belonging to the order Acipenseriformes. There are 8 genera in total, the two main species being the American and Chinese paddlefish, and the other 5 being fossil genera. Aside from the American paddlefish, there is a hypothetical extinct species called \"Polyodon\" tuberculata, but there's not a lot of information about it. == Description == Just like sturgeons, paddlefish have a cartilaginous skeleton. They also have a unique feature; their notochord is still there despite growing up. == Classification == * Family Polyodontidae Bonaparte, 1838 (paddlefish) ** Genus †Protopsephurus Lu, 1994 ** Genus †Paleopsephurus MacAlpin, 1941a ** Genus †Pugiopsephurus Hilton et al., 2023 ** Genus †Parapsephurus Hilton et al., 2023 ** Subfamily Polyodontinae Grande & Bemis, 1991 non Pflugfelder, 1934 *** Genus †Crossopholis Cope, 1883 *** Genus Polyodon Lacépède, 1797 (American paddlefish) *** Genus †Psephurus Günther, 1873 (Chinese paddlefish) == Habitat == === P. spathula === See the main article: American paddlefish The American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) once lived in oxbow lakes, big rivers, and more. However, it is now limited to the Mississippi possibly due to overfishing. === P. gladius === See the main article: Chinese paddlefish The Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius) lived in the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers while it was still alive, but now, it's extinct. == Gallery == File:Crossopholis.png|Restoration of Crossopholis File:Parapsephurus.jpg|Holotype of Parapsephurus, note that the snout is separated File:Paddlefish-USFWS-Fish-and-Aquatic-Conservation-2160x1440.jpg|An American paddlefish swimming File:Psephurus gladius.jpg|Restoration of the Chinese paddlefish File:Protopsephurus-Tianjin Natural History Museum.jpg|Fossil of Protopsephurus File:Fish of the yixian formation (named).png|Restoration of Protopsephurus along with other fishes of the Yixian Formation == References == # \"Chinese paddlefish, one of world's largest fish, declared extinct\".
