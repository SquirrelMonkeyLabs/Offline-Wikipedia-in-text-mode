 "text": "A Single Man is an album. It is by British singer-songwriter Elton John. It was released in 1978. ==Background== It is the first of John's albums not to feature long-time collaborators Bernie Taupin (lyricist) and Gus Dudgeon (producer). As Gary Osborne was unknown at the time, many people misinterpreted the album's title to imply that John wrote the entire album himself. The only returning members of his band are percussionist Ray Cooper and guitarist Davey Johnstone; the latter only played on one song on the album. Paul Buckmaster did not appear on another Elton John album until Made in England. Unlike previous compositions where the lyrics came first, John began writing melodies at a piano and it unintentionally became an album. ==Songs== The hit \"Song for Guy\" was a tribute to Guy Burchett, a young messenger for Rocket Records who was killed in a motorcycle accident. The song was a near-global hit, reaching charts high everywhere except in the US and Canada, where John's label, MCA Records, did not feel it had any potential, due to the recent success of the instrumental \"Music Box Dancer\". The songs \"Return To Paradise\" and \"Song For Guy\" are used in the 1980 film Oh! Heavenly Dog. ==Certifications== } } } } } ==References== Single Man, A Single Man, A Single Man, A",
