It is the largest state of India in terms of land area; 132,150 mi² (342,269 km²). It is bigger than the Republic of the Congo but smaller than Germany. In traditional India geography it falls under the North Indian zone. The Thar Desert covers most parts of the state. The capital of the state is city of Jaipur. Rajasthan is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and barren landscapes. With a population of over 68 million(2011), Rajasthan is home to a diverse group of people, including the Rajputs, Jats, Meenas, and Bhils, who have contributed to the region’s unique identity and cultural heritage. Before Indian independence the area of Rajasthan and parts of Eastern Pakistan were known as Rajputana; it consisted of many states of varying sizes ruled by Rajput kings. == Rajasthani Singers== * Ila Arun * Rajnigandha Shekhawat * Seema Mishra * Meme Khan * Swaroop Khan * Rapperiya Baalam * Satkeer == Districts == There are 50 districts in Rajasthan * Anupgarh * Balotra * Beawar * Deeg * Didwana-Kuchaman City * Dudu * Gangapur City * Jaipur North * Jaipur South * Jodhpur East * Jodhpur West * Kekri * Kotputli-Behror * Khairthal * Neemkathana * Phalodi * Salumbar * Sanchore * Shahpura (Bhilwara) * Sikar == Divisions == * Barmer * Chittaurgarh * Bhilwara * Nagaur * Sawai madhopur ==Provincial symbols of Rajasthan== Image:Sonchiriya.jpg|Provincial bird of Rajasthan Image:Chinkara.jpg|Provincial animal of Rajasthan Image:Khejari (Prosopis cineraria).JPG|Provincial tree of Rajasthan Image:Oroxylum indicum W IMG 3170.jpg|Provincial flower of Rajasthan ==See also== *Shri Khushan Das University *Hanumangarh Assembly constituency *2023 Rajasthan Legislative Assembly election *Javed Khan == Read About Rajasthan == * Population of Rajsthan In 2023 * Sex Ratio of Rajasthan in 2023",
