The landscape has woods, meadows, rivers and creeks and contains over 20 artificial lakes. Wuppertal is one of the biggest towns and is known as the region's capital, and the southern part nowadays has closer economic and socio-cultural ties to Cologne. Wuppertal and the neighbouring cities of Remscheid, Solingen form the Bergisches St√§dtedreieck. ==References== Category:Mountain ranges of Germany Category:Geography of North Rhine- Westphalia",
