 "text": "In ancient Greek religion, Nemesis (), is the goddess who eventually takes vengeance against those who show hubris (arrogance before the gods). Divine retribution is a major theme in the Hellenic world view. It is the unifying theme of the tragedies of Sophocles and many other literary works.Sanders, Karin. \"Nemesis of Mimesis: The Problem of Representation in H. Andersen's \"Psychen\".\" Scandinavian Studies 64, no. 1 (1992): 1-25. http://www.jstor.org/stable/40919385. She carried a measuring rod (a tally stick), a bridle, scales, a sword, and a scourge (whip), and she rides in a chariot drawn by griffins. Nemesis often is seen with another goddess, Aidos. Aidos is the goddess of shame. She is similar to Nemesis.Homer, Illiad, 13,121f The Ancient Greek made different meanings for what they called \"justice\": * Nemesis (as a goddess who gives to each what they deserve) * Dike (to be in charge of what we would call civil law today) * Dikaiosyne (\"a just state,\" where the word justice comes from, meaning that everything is fair in their country) * Nomos (a law made by the government) In works of fiction the hero's nemesis is usually the villain and the hardest antagonist for the hero to defeat. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Greek gods and goddesses",
