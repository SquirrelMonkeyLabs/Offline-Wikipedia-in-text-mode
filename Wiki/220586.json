 "text": "Ornitholestes was a carnivorous dinosaur which lived in the Upper Jurassic period about 156145 million years ago. It was about 2 metres long (6.6 feet), half of which was its long tail. Only one specimen of it has ever been found. It is one of a group of small, fast-running dinosaurs which are classified as early Coelurosaurs. It is known from a partial skeleton found near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1900. It was described by paleontologist Henry F. Osborn in 1903. == Description == Ornitholestes was a bipedal runner. Its small head suggests it ate small mammals, lizards, frogs, and hatchling dinosaurs. It could grasp prey with both hands. It is likely that all coelurosaurs had feathers. == Similar dinosaurs == Coelurus, Compsognathus, Tanycolagreus. == References == category:Coelurosaurs",
