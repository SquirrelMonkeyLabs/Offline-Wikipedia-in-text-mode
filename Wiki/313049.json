 "text": "Lenovo Center is a sports arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. The arena opened on October 29, 1999, and is the current home to the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL) and North Carolina State University Wolfpack men's basketball. The arena was originally known as Raleigh Entertainment & Sports Arena until RBC Bank, the U.S. division of the Royal Bank of Canada, acquired naming rights for 20 years, which cost a reported $80 million. The name then changed to RBC Center. The arena was also host to many WWE events such as SummerSlam in 2000 and No Mercy in 2006. In 2011, the Royal Bank of Canada sold RBC Bank to PNC Financial Services, and the arena's name was officially changed to PNC Arena on March 15, 2012. On September 12, 2024, the arena changed its name to the Lenovo Center after the naming rights were sold to Chinese technology company Lenovo for ten years. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Sports buildings in the United States Category:Sports in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in North Carolina Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in North Carolina Category:Carolina Hurricanes",
