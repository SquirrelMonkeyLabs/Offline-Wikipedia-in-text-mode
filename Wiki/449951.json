 "text": "Elder abuse (also senior abuse) is a single or repeated act of abuse towards an elderly person. It can also be when a lack of good care causes harm or distress to an older person. It can be physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse or verbal abuse. Elder abuse happens when there is an \"expectation of trust\" by the older person toward their abuser.International Perspectives on Elder Abuse, ed. Amanda Phelan (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 2013), p. 7 Usually the abuser is someone the older person knows or with whom they have a relationship. This could be a spouse, partner or family member, a friend or neighbor. It could be a caregiver that the older person depends on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence. ==References== Learn about senior abuse awareness and prevention with this infographic Category:Abuse Category:Old age",
