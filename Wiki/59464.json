 "text": "Instant soups are a kind of soup. They are produced on an industrial scale. Later they are treated in different ways to preserve them. Usually they are dried, canned, or treated by freezing. Packaged instant soups come in two varieties: * A packet of dry soup (like the ramen image below). These do not contain water. They are prepared by adding water and heating, or by adding hot water. * A tin (or can) containing cold soup. To prepare those need to only be heated (for 3â€“5 minutes usually). There is another type of canned soup where the liquid is condensed and needs water added to it to make an edible soup.
