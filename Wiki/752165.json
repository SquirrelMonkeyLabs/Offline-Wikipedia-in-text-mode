Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu newspaper, claims: \"It's basically a Punjabi dish not more than 40–50 years old and must be an accidental discovery which has had periodical improvisations.\" Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston Chronicle, wrote that \"the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early ’70s by an enterprising Indian chef near London\" who used Campbell's tomato soup. \\- See at Pressreader This is disputed by author Jo Monroe, who claims that this story was invented by the founder of a London restaurant \"to entertain journalists\". The oldest reference to chicken tikka masala is found in 1960s, where a Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmad Aslam, created the dish in his restaurant in Glasgow, on request of a customer who was unhappy with the chicken tikka. Aslam is said to have invented chicken tikka masala by adding spices to a tin of tomato soup. Aslam died in 2022 at the age of 77.\"Glaswegian who 'invented' chicken tikka masala dies\", BBC News, 21 December 2022.
