He has been named one of the greatest Belgian snooker talents ever. ==Biography== When he was 17 years old he finished second at the under-21 world championships in Bangalore, losing the final from Ronnie O'Sullivan. A year later he finished again second in Brunei, losing this time from Robin Hull. Delsemme became Belgian junior champion in 1991 and 1992, and became senior champion in 1995 and 1997. He was for seven years a professional player. In 2001 he had his best season where he was ranked 107th worldwide, he was suspended for two years after testing positive for the use of cannabis twice. He also lost his ranking points and also had to pay back the prize money he won at those tournaments (£11,000). In 2022, Delsemme had taken part by invitation in a major snooker tournament in Casablanca, Morocco, where he died on 8 December 2022, at the age of 48. ==References== Category:Snooker players Category:1974 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Liège Category:Place of death missing",
