 "text": "The Nieuport 11 is a French single-engine biplane fighter aircraft used during World War I that allowed France to defeat the German Fokker Eindeckers. It sometimes called \"Bébé\" (the French word for baby) due to its small size. A more powerful version, the Nieuport 16 was also built, leading to a series of fighters that served into the 1920s. ==Sources== Category:French military aircraft Category:World War I aircraft",
