A beam balance is a type of scale that uses a beam with weights suspended from it's ends to measure the weight or mass of an object. The object to be weighed is placed on one end of the beam, and weights are added to the other end until the beam is in equilibrium, meaning that the two sides are balanced. They are designed to measure the weight or mass of an object by suspending it from a beam. ==References== Category:Machines Category:Measuring tools",
