 "text": "The Oxapampa poison frog (Ameerega planipaleae) is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. People have seen it near streams and in wet places on mountains. People see the frog on the dead leaves on the ground. It can live in forest that has been destroyed and is growing back near pine farms. People saw it on small farms, passion fruit farms and chilli farms. They saw it on what used to be a fish farm. Scientists saw the frog between 1924 and 2080 meters above sea level. The frog lives near Yanachaga- Chemill√©n National Park, but scientists have not written that they saw the frog inside the park. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. In some places, humans change the places where the frog lives to make farms, especially farms for chili peppers and granadilla. The chemicals that farms put on the plants to make them grow can poison the frog. People also cut down trees to get wood. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
