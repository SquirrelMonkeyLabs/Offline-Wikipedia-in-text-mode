 "text": "Grumpy Cat (April 4, 2012 – May 14, 2019) was a famous cat on the internet. Her real name is Tardar Sauce. She became popular because she always looked unhappy or \"grumpy\". Her owner said that her grumpy-looking face was due to feline dwarfism and the placement of her teeth in her mouth. Grumpy Cat died at home on May 14, 2019 of a urinary tract infection. == History before popularity == Grumpy Cat, lived with her owner, Tabatha Bundesen, in Morristown, Arizona. She was born on April 4, 2012, with \"a flat face, bubble eyes, and a short tail\". Her mom was a calico short haired cat and her father had grey and white stripes. Tardar Sauce was small for her breed and had hind legs that \"were a bit different\". Even though she had a grumpy expression all the time, she was calm and \"actually really nice\". Her brother, Pokey, who was born in the same litter, had the grumpy personality. Her owners said Tardar Sauce was a normal cat \"99% of the time\". She was only allowed to have photos taken once a week. She could not be handled by people she did not know very often. == Popularity == Grumpy Cat first became famous when Tabatha's brother posted some photos of her on Reddit, the social-news site. Then, other users made photoshopped parodies of the unhappy cat with grumpy sayings, such as: ‘I had fun once. It was awful’ and ‘Just put me down’. Grumpy Cat has her own website. She has a Facebook page. She has a manager, Ben Lashes. He also represents Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat. There are stuffed toy cats of her, t-shirts, calendars and mugs available for sale in stores and online. Many are featured on her website.
