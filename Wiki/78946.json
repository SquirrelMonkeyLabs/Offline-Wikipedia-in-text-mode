 "text": "The banjo is a string instrument, that was first played by African slaves in the United States a few hundred years ago. The idea came from other African instruments.Bluegrass Music: The Roots .\" IBMA. Retrieved on 2006-08-25 The name banjo may have come from a Kimbundu word: mbanza, but it could have also come from a Senegambian word for the bamboo stick used for the banjo's neck. The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a guitar, has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast arpeggiated plucking, though many different playing styles exist. ==Related pages== * Bluegrass music * Country music ==References== == Further reading == === Banjo history === * Conway, Cecelia (1995).
