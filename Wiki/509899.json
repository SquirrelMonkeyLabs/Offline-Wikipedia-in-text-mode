 "text": "Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is a 2015 indie point-and-click survival horror video game designed by Scott Cawthon, and the fourth entry in the Five Nights at Freddy's series. The game was released on Steam on July 23, 2015. A demo for the game was released to select YouTubers on July 21, 2015, with the full game being released on July 23, 2015. The game was released for Android devices on July 25, 2015. In this game, you play as a child who has to stop 'Nightmare', animatronics from getting into your room and killing you. You can shine your flashlight down the hall to see if there are any animatronics down the hall and shut the doors if you hear the animatronics breathing, however the doors won't stay closed forever. You must also shine your flashlight on the bed to scare away Freddles (which are mini versions of Nightmare Freddy) so Nightmare Freddy won't kill you. There is also a minigame where you must have Plushtrap (A small plushie version of Springtrap with sharp teeth) sit on an X. In between the nights the player takes control of “the crying child” in 8-bit style minigames reminiscent of old arcade games where you explore your home, your town and a restaurant featuring two golden animatronics on stage. ==References== Category:2015 video games Category:2010s horror video games Category:Five Nights at Freddy's Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Indie video games Category:IOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:Single-player video games Category:Survival horror video games Category:Video game prequels Category:Video games about children Category:Video games about nightmares Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
