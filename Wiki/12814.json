 "text": "Saint Patrick's Day is the feast day of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, and a day of celebration of Ireland, its culture, people and its history. Saint Patrick’s Day is also known as Paddy’s day. == Celebrations == St. Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17 all over Ireland and everywhere in the world where Irish people or their descendants live. New York City has one of the biggest parades. It is a very Irish festival, and it involves a lot of feasting and celebration, including traditional Irish music, drinking beer, and eating bacon and cabbage. Another tradition of Saint Patrick’s day is that one has to wear green clothing or they will be pinched. Green is the color of Saint Patrick's day as it is the national color of Ireland. People often wear green on that day or have some type of shamrock on their clothing. It is very common that they wear a Shamrock, a three leaved plant which is also a symbol for Ireland. The first St. Patrick's Day parade in Ireland was held in Waterford in 1903. In the beginning, it was a 3 day long celebration, but now it is a 5-day celebration. == Celebration in Ireland == Saint Patrick's Day (1).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (2).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (3).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (4).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (5).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (6).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (7).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (8).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (9).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (10).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (11).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (12).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (13).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (14).jpg Saint Patrick's Day (15).jpg Category:Christian holidays Category:March observances Category:National symbols of the Republic of Ireland",
