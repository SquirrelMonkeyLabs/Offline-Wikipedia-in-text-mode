Oldest stone tools pre-date earliest humans. BBC News Science & Environment. Harmand, Sonia et al 2015. 3.3-million-year- old stone tools from Lomekwi 3, West Turkana, Kenya. Nature 521, 310â€“315. About 99% of human history happened during the Stone Age. It lasted for about 3.4 million years, and ended between 4,000 BC and 2,000 BC. Stone Age people also made tools out of wood and bone. However, these materials do not last as long as stone. For this reason, most of the Stone Age tools archaeologists have found are made of stone. Archaeologists divide the Stone Age into three sections: Palaeolithic (\"old stone\"), Mesolithic (\"middle stone\"), and Neolithic (\"new stone\"). During the Neolithic period, people invented farming and pottery, and started to care for animals like cows and pigs. Sometime between 3000 BC and 2000 BC, people discovered the art of (making metals). This probably happened in the Middle East. People used copper first, then learned how to make bronze. When people started using these metals instead of stone, the Stone Age ended and the Bronze Age began. Some groups of people in Papua New Guinea continued to use Stone Age technology into the 20th century. They used stone-tipped weapons to kill animals for food and clothing. They made shelters using animal skin. Food that was eaten in the Stone Age was berries (e.g. blackberries), fish, animals (e.g. mammoth) and animal organs. == References == Category:Prehistory",
