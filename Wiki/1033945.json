 "text": "\"Sad!\" (written as \"SAD!\") is the first single off of American rapper XXXTentacion's second studio album ?. The song was released on March 2, 2018. The song was able to make it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 after he died. It was also certified 10Ã— Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is one of X's most popular songs, gaining over 2 billion streams on Spotify. X is the first lead musician to gain a Billboard number one song after their death since \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" by The Notorious B.I.G. in 1997. ==Music video== On June 28, 2018, a music video for the song was released a day after his public memorial service. The music video was directed by JMP. In the video, it begins with a figure introducing themselves as Gekyume and asking different questions. The figure is in pitch black and all you can see are their eyes. In the next scene, X walks up to a casket which has his younger self in it. Older X looks at his younger self and the younger X comes to life to attack him. The two Xs start fighting in the church and older X kicks his younger self into an alley. The video cuts to a hooded figure talking to X. The figure wants X to live a life of love rather than hate. X defeats his younger self in the fight and brings his body to an all- white area. A piece of paper appears that says \"People change, things change and so did I.\" The words \"LONG LIVE PRINCE X\" appear over the screen. People believe that the music video is X's way of feeling bad and regretting his past way of life. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2018 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs Category:Hip hop songs",
