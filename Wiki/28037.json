 "text": "Fencing is a sport for two people with different kinds of swords. The aim is to score hits. There is also a referee. == Weapons == === Foil === The foil is a light and easy to bend weapon, first made in mid 17th century as a weapon for practice. 'Hits' can only be scored by hitting the target area with the point of the sword. The target area is the torso. === Épée === The épée is the heaviest of the three weapons. To score a hit, the push-button on the end of the weapon must remain fully down for 2-10 milliseconds, and must arrive (hit) with a force of at least 7.35 newtons. The target area for Épée is the entire body. This includes the feet and the head. === Sabre === The sabre is the \"cutting\" weapon, with a curved guard (to protect the hand) and a triangular blade. However, in modern electric scoring, a touch with any part of the sabre, (point, flat or edge, as long as it is on target) will count as a hit. The target area in sabre is everything from the waist up, except for the hands. == Uniform == Fencers wear a uniform to avoid injury. They wear a mask of black mesh with a bib. Also, a jacket, short pants and a sort of half-a- shirt (called an underarm protector or plastron), all of white fabric. They must also wear socks that cover their legs. Women must wear a chest protector. These are collectively called \"whites.\" == Related pages == *Kendo *Swordsmanship == Other websites == * Fédération Internationale d'Escrime The organisation responsible for all international fencing Category:Summer Olympic sports",
