 "text": "Liang Wenbo (; born 5 March 1987) is a Chinese former professional snooker player. He won one ranking title at the 2016 English Open. He twice won the World Cup for China in 2011 and 2017 with teammate Ding Junhui. Liang was runner-up at the 2009 Shanghai Masters and the 2015 UK Championship. He made 292 century breaks in professional competition, including three maximum breaks. He reached a career high of 11th in the snooker world rankings. Liang was convicted on a domestic assault charge in April 2022. The sport's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), suspended him for four months. The WPBSA suspended Liang again in October 2022. It carried out a match-fixing investigation by him and nine other Chinese players. It found Liang guilty of multiple match-fixing offences, as well as destroying evidence and not cooperating with the investigation. The WPBSA announced in June 2023 that it had permanently banned Liang and compatriot Li Hang from the sport, the only two lifetime bans ever handed down in professional snooker. The Chinese Billiards and Snooker Association (CBSA) upheld the WPBSA's decision.https://wst.tv/statement-on- liang-wenbo/ == References == == Other websites == * Liang Wenbo at the World Snooker Tour (archived) * Liang Wenbo at snooker.org Category:Medalists at the 2010 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Chinese sportspeople Category:Snooker players Category:Living people Category:1987 births Category:People from Heilongjiang",
