 "text": "The inauguration of Grover Cleveland as the 24th president of the United States happened on March 4, 1893. It was the start of the second and final four-year term of Grover Cleveland as president and the only term of Adlai Stevenson I as vice president. The ceremony was held at the East Front of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. This event was the 27th inauguration. Cleveland had previously been the 22nd president, and was the first president to serve two non-consecutive terms. Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the presidential oath of office. Levi P. Morton administered the vice presidential oath to Stevenson. This was the first inauguration in which a former president was re-inaugurated to a non- consecutive term. This did not happen again until the swearing-in of Donald Trump in 2025, following his victory in the 2024 presidential election. ==References== ==Other websites== Text of Cleveland's Second Inaugural Address Category:1893 in the United States Category:United States presidential inaugurations Category:Grover Cleveland",
