The shekel is the name of money used in ancient times in the Bible and in places like the Land of Israel. People usually call the money simply \"the shekel.\" The plural of shekel is shkalim. Shkalim are divided into 100 agorot. The shekel has its own special symbol: ₪. This comes from joining the first two letters of the words in Hebrew for New Shekel (ש\"ח). In English, shekel can be written as NIS (standing for 'New Israeli Shekel'). Category:Currency of Asia Category:Economy of Israel",
