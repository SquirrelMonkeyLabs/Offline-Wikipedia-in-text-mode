 "text": "The Minoan civilization was a civilization on Crete called after Minos. It began in the Bronze Age between 3000 and 2700 BC. It lasted until about 1450 BC. The Minoan civilization is famous for its sea trading and well-planned cities. The Minoans had an agricultural system, which relied mainly on olives and grapes. Their religion worshipped mostly goddesses. Their civilization was later replaced by the Mycenaean culture. == Architecture == Cretans built palaces during their architecture era, from 2000 BC to 1450 BC. A non-royal palace had many small rooms with cooler places to sit, because Crete got very hot in the summer. Palaces were used for many things: government centers, storerooms, stores, and administrative offices. Most palaces were very big. The Cretans might have gotten the money to create their palaces from working for the Egyptians. The royal palace was very different. Everyone had toilets, baths, and running water. The ones for the king and queen were very fancy, as was their palace was fancy. The architecture era was ended by a great fire. ==Further reading== *http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/greeks/history/minoans.htm *http://photo.pds.org:5005/student/article?id=ar028740 *Minoan civilization -Academic Kids Category:Minoan culture",
