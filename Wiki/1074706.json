 "text": "Solar magnetic storms are also known as Geomagnetic storms. These are major disturbances to Earth's magnetosphere that happens when one of the Sun's solar winds passes into the space environment around Earth. These storms can be caused due to major changes in the currents and plasmas of Earth's magnetosphere. The largest storms which arise from these conditions are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Category:Astrophysics",
