 "text": "Fresh Horses is the sixth studio album by American country music artist Garth Brooks. It was released on November 21, 1995. Fresh Horses peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and #1 on the Top Country Albums chart. The album had a worldwide radio ban until it was available to buy. Only the two singles issued (\"She's Every Woman\" and \"The Fever\") were allowed to be played before this date, the latter of which was a new country-rock version of an old Aerosmith song. Through 2006, approximately 7 million copies have been sold in the U.S. ==Background== Brooks commented on the album saying: \"Everyone was expecting this album to be pop. Everyone said we were leaving (country). For the first time ever, I was involved (in writing) in eight of the 10 cuts, so it's a huge reflection of myself. It's the things I enjoy singing about. I got to sing about the band on the road, I got to sing about cowboys, and more importantly, the women who put up with those cowboys.' ==Track listing== #\"The Old Stuff\" (Bryan Kennedy, Dan Roberts, Garth Brooks) – 4:12 #\"Cowboys and Angels\" (Kent Blazy, Kim Williams, Brooks) – 3:16 #\"The Fever\" (Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Roberts, Kennedy) – 2:40 #\"That Ol' Wind\" (Leigh Reynolds, Brooks) – 5:22 #\"Rollin'\" (Harley Allen, Reynolds, Brooks) – 4:07 #\"The Change\" (Tony Arata, Wayne Tester) – 4:06 #\"The Beaches of Cheyenne\" (Roberts, Kennedy, Brooks) – 4:13 #\"It's Midnight Cinderella\" (Williams, Blazy, Brooks) – 2:23 #\"She's Every Woman\" (Victoria Shaw, Brooks) – 2:53 #”Ireland\" (Stephanie Davis, Jenny Yates, Brooks) – 5:01 “The Limited Series” (1998) of the album inserted a cover of Bob Dylan’s “To Make You Feel My Love” between tracks 7 and 8. ==Chart performance== Fresh Horses peaked at #2 on the U.S. Billboard 200, and peaked #1 on the Top Country Albums, becoming his sixth #1 Country album.
