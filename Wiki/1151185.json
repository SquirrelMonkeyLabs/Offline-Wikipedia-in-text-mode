 "text": "The yellow-painted poison arrow frog, yellow-spotted frog, or Lutz's poison frog (Ameerega flavopicta) is a frog. It lives in Brazil and Bolivia. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. People see it in cracks in rocks near streams and on plants near waterfalls and on the dead leaves on the ground. It can live in some grassy places. Scientists saw the frog between 400 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog lives in many protected places: Área de Preservação Ambiental da Nascente do Rio das Balsas, Área de Preservação Ambiental Lago de São Salvador do Tocantins, Paranana e Palmeirópolis, Área de Preservação Ambiental Morro da Pedreira, Área de Preservação Ambiental Pouso Alto, Área de Preservação Ambiental Serra da Jibóia, Área de Preservação Ambiental Serra do Cabral Augusto de Lima, Estação Ecológica de Pirapitinga, Floresta Nacional de Carajás, Parque Estadual Cristalino II, Parque Estadual da Serra de Caldas Novas, Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros, Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra, Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipo, Parque Nacional do Jamanxim, RPPN Fazenda Arruda, and RPPN Fazenda Pioneira. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans change the places where the frog lives. People make places for animals to eat grass and to make farms. People make dams, which changes streams and rivers. People cut down trees to get wood. Mining can also hurt this frog. People do catch this frog to sell as a pet, but scientists say this is not a danger to the frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
