 "text": "Hydra are simple invertebrates, with two layers of body cells. They live in fresh water. Their body is radially symmetric. They have a central cavity through which they take in food and expel waste. As Cnidaria, they have stinging cells on their tentacles. They are hydrozoa, and belong to the same order as other polyps. Most Hydra are microscopic in size. Hydras can be found in almost any unpolluted body of water. Hydras reproduce by budding. In budding, the offspring forms as a lump on the parent and eventually becomes big enough to break off and live by itself. They can move if they need to by a kind of slow somersaulting motion. Recent research has found they produce an anti microbial protein hydramacin, which protects their outer layer from bacterial infection.Jung S. et al 2009. Hydramacin-1, structure and antibacterial activity of a protein from the basal metazoan Hydra. Journal of Biological Chemistry 284 (3): 1896â€“1905. Hydra are biologically immortal: they do not die of old age. If cut they can regenerate half their body in 2 to 3 days. == References == Category:Cnidarians",
