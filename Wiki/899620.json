 "text": "Protests began in Montenegro on 19 January 2022 against the proposition of URA to remove Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapić and his cabinet from power. They are also against the formation of a temporary minority government. Since most ministers of the cabinet are close to Krivokapić, most ministers supported or attended these protests. The protests are being held in multiple cities such as Podgorica, Bijelo Polje and Berane. While most have been peaceful, there have been cases of violence at the protests, such as the assault of a reporter. Krivokapić was removed from power in a motion of no confidence on 4 February 2022. ==References== Category:January 2022 events Category:2022 in Europe Category:2022 protests",
