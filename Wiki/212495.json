 "text": "A school shooting or school massacre is when someone fires a gun at people in an educational institution. (I.e. Schools, Colleges) Many school shootings have happened in the United States. Very often, the person responsible for the attack is a former student or pupil who had to leave the school. Most of the time, school shootings are planned attacks. When planning, the attackers either want to get a lot of media attention, or they want to kill or hurt as many people as possible. In most cases, the perpetrators will announce/leak the idea, either directly or indirectly. Some certain things or events trigger such a shooting: The person will react to these triggers with anger, frustration, or despair. The shooter will often commit suicide at the end, whether that be using the gun they have so they can take their life or they will plan the shooting out in a way where the authorities will shoot and kill them. Research has shown that the perpetrators either want to kill or hurt fellow students, or they want to hurt teachers/professors; cases where both groups are targeted are rare. Most of the time, there is one attacker. Cases where two or three people act together are rare. ==Notable school shootings== *Columbine High School massacre *Dawson College shooting *Dunblane massacre *Ã‰cole Polytechnique massacre *Erfurt massacre *Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting *University of Texas Massacre *Virginia Tech massacre *Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting *Westside Middle School shooting *Belsan massacre Category:Educational institutions",
