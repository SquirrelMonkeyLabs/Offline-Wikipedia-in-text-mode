 "text": "The Oreo is a cookie sandwich or cream biscuit. It is made by the Nabisco division of MondelÄ“z International. The cookie has a sweet, white filling of \"creme\" or \"cream\". The creme is in between two circle-shaped chocolate or golden cookie pieces. Oreos come in many different flavours like chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, caramel coconut, chocolate marshmallow and many more. The origin of the name \"Oreo\" is not known, but there are many ideas for why they are called that. It may have been named after a plant genus called Oreodaphne, but it could be named after the French word or (which means gold in English) and it could be named after the Greek word (), which means 'nice' or 'attractive'. ==References== Category:Sandwich cookies Category:Cookies",
