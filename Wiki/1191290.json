 "text": "Paper was a Nubian king of Old Dongola. Paper is known only from an inscription found carved into the wall stucco in the church of Banganarti. This inscription, along with the stucco, maybe dated to the 14th century. The ruler refers to himself as Paper, King of the City of Tungul. Tungul is the Nubian name for Old Dongola. This royal title has not yet been documented. The end of the Makurian Empire remains obscure, but this short inscription is of particular importance for understanding the period. Apparently, the Makurian Empire disintegrated into smaller units in the 14th century, and Old Dongola, the former capital, was not abandoned, as previously assumed, but appears to have continued to exist for a while as a city-state with a king. == Literature == * Adam Lajtar: Banganarti 2004, Inscriptions, Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean XVI (2006), 309â€“312 Category:King (Nubia) Category:Born in the 14th century Category:Died in the 14th or 15th century Category:Man",
