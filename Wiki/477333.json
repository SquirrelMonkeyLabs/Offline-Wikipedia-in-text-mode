 "text": "Myuran Sukumaran (; 17 April 1981 - 29 April 2015) was an Australian citizen who was executed in Indonesia for drug trafficking as a member of the Bali Nine. He was born in London, England. His parents were Sri Lankan immigrants. He moved to Australia at a young age. In 2005, Sukumaran was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were the apparent co-ringleaders of the heroin smuggling operation. After a criminal trial on 14 February 2006, Sukumaran was sentenced to execution by firing squad. On 30 December 2014, Sukumaran's request for clemency was rejected by the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo. Sukumaran and Chan were in prison at Nusakambangan Island in isolation cells. On 16 January 2015, Sukumaran and Chan were ordered to be executed after nine years in jail. On 6 February 2015, it was stated that Chan and Sukumaran would be executed by the end of the month. On 11 February 2015, Indonesian authorities approved the move of Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Nusakambangan Island in preparation for execution. On 24 February 2015, a final appeal to save Chan and Sukumaran from execution, with their lawyers appeal bid to challenge President Widodo's refusal to grant clemency, failed. The move from Kerobokan prison to Nusakambangan Island was on 4 March. On 6 April 2015, Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers faced the state administrative court to challenge President Joko Widodo's refusal to grant clemency, in a final attempt to stop the executions. This was also unsuccessful. On 24 April 2015, prosecutors ordered the final preparations for the execution of Chan and Sukumaran, as well as eight others on death row. On 25 April (ANZAC Day), the pair, along with 7 other death row prisoners, were given a 72-hour notice of their executions. Sukumaran was executed by firing squad on 29 April 2015 along with Chan as well as Nigerians Raheem Agbaje Salami, Okwuduli Oyatanze, Sylvester Obiekwe Nwolise, Ghanaian Martin Anderson, Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte and Indonesian Zainal Abidin. Sukumaran's funeral was conducted at Dayspring Church, Castle Hill on 9 May 2015. ==References== Category:1981 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Artists from New South Wales Category:Australian drug dealers Category:Australian painters Category:Australian prisoners Category:Criminals from London Category:Australian martial artists Category:People executed by firearm Category:People from Sydney",
