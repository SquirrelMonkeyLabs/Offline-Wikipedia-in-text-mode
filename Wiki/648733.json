 "text": "Canadian Tire Centre () is an indoor arena in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, located in the western suburb of Kanata. It can be used for many purposes. It opened in January 1996 as The Palladium and was also known as Corel Centre from 1996 to 2006 and Scotiabank Place from 2006 to 2013. The Ottawa Senators play hockey here. On June 23, 2022, a proposal was accepted that would build a new arena in the LeBreton Flats area of downtown Ottawa. The arena will replace the Canadian Tire Centre as the new home arena for the Senators when it's built. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official site *Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame Category:Indoor arenas Category:Music venues Category:Sports buildings in Canada Category:1996 establishments in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Ottawa Category:Ottawa Senators",
