 "text": "Sudden Strike is a computer game about World War II. The game was developed by Russian company Fireglow and published by CDV software of Germany. The games focus on tactics without traditional real-time strategy resource gathering and base development. Sudden Strike had a commercial success, with global sales of roughly 800,000 units by 2002. == Gameplay == The main story features three campaigns (Soviets, Germans, and Allied forces). == Sudden Strike Forever == Sudden Strike Forever was an official add-on to Sudden Strike which shows more historically correct units and equipment. New terrains are also provided. The expansion also improved the game engine, balanced the damage of certain units, and added a map and scenario editor. The add-on includes 4 scenarios for each of the campaigns for the Germans, the American, the British and the Soviets. Other units which are added into the add-on includes, but not limited to the Universal Carrier for the British. The supply system has also been tweaked with artillery crews automatically resupplying themselves with ammo crates nearby instead of relying on supply trucks to do the job. The supply trucks would still be needed to repair damages inflicted on these artillery units, however. == Reception == === Sales === In Germany Sudden Strike became 1 place on Media Control's sales chart for September 2000. It also awarded by The Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
