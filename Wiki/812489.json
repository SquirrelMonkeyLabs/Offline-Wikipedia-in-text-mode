 "text": "The Village People is an American disco group. They are known for suggestive lyrics, onstage costumes and some very catchy tunes. The group was originally formed by French producers Jacques Morali, Henri Belolo and lead singer Victor Willis. That was after the release of their first album Village People. The album targeted disco's largely homosexual audience. The group's name refers to Manhattan's Greenwich Village. That area has a reputation as a gay village. The characters were a symbolic group for American masculinity and macho-gay themed fantasy personas: policeman, Native American, construction worker, rock band member, cowboy, and soldier. The Village People had a number of hit singles, including \"In the Navy\", \"Y.M.C.A.\" and \"Macho Man\" in the late 1970s and early 1980s. ==References== Category:Disco groups Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:Musical groups established in 1977 Category:1970s establishments in New York (state) Category:1977 establishments in the United States",
