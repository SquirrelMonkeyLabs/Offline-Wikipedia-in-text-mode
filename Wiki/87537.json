 "text": "Social democracy is a political ideology within socialism. The ideology is named for democracy where people have a say in government actions and it works to introduce socialism while also helping people in need by providing healthcare, education and social welfare. This makes it easier for people to support themselves in society by having more protection if they are unemployed or fall into poverty. As an ideology within socialism, it places an emphasis on equal rights for everyone, and there is plenty of government ownership or regulation of various industries to protect the public interest. The ideology's movement has seen some interest in other countries whose economic systems do not work this way, because it has worked well for those who have it. Social democracy is supportive of Keynesian economics, where the government should step in and help people in need or without jobs. Social democracy strives to achieve a balance between capitalism and socialism or a balance between the public sector and private sector in the economy. == Practice versus theory == Some would argue that capitalist systems are not without help for the poor and the needy. An example is England, where relief for the poor was available in every parish in the land, long before there were any government social services. The practice was known as charity. Also, Britain saw the growth of an important middle class after industrialisation took hold. So it is not completely right to think of such societies as simply composed of owners and workers, or rich and poor. Social democrats are divided in how they see their theory and it has been a subject of much debate around the world. Terms like \"market socialism\" and \"the third way\" are efforts to rethink what social democracy means today. == Related pages == *Socialist International *Nationalization *Welfare state == References == Category:Socialism Category:Democracy Category:Political systems",
