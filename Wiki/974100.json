 "text": "MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1, also known as Icarus, is a blue supergiant star observed through a gravitational lens that might be 193.4 times the radius of the Sun. It is the second most distant individual star to have been detected so far (second only to WHL0137-LS, also known as Earendel, as of March 2022), at about 14 billion light-years from Earth (redshift z=1.49; comoving distance of 14.4 billion light-years; Cosmic time of 9.34 billion years). Light from the star was emitted 4.4 billion years after the Big Bang. According to co- discoverer Patrick Kelly, the star is at least a hundred times more distant than the next-farthest non-supernova star observed, SDSS J1229+1122, and is the first magnified individual star seen. == References == Category:Stars",
