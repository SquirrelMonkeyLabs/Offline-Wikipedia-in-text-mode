It owns several famous brands such as Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Gucci, Alexander McQueen, and Yves Saint Laurent. The company's history dates back to 1962 when François Pinault founded a timber-trading company called Pinault S.A. Over time, the company expanded its operations and went public on Euronext Paris in 1988. In 1994, it transformed into a retail conglomerate known as Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR). Eventually, in 2013, the company rebranded itself as Kering, focusing on luxury products. François-Henri Pinault has held the positions of president and CEO of Kering since 2005. == Other websites == * Category:1962 establishments in Europe Category:1960s establishments in France Category:Companies based in Paris",
