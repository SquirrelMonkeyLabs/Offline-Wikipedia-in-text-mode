He wrestled in the 1970s, 1980s, and mid-1990s for many promotions including Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Slater began wrestling in Championship Wrestling from Florida and Georgia Championship Wrestling. He worked as a booker in Knoxville, Tennessee after Ron Fuller sold his promotion to Jim Barnett. He wrestled briefly in the World Wrestling Federation as a babyface under a \"Rebel\" gimmick, but soon returned to WCW. He wrestled there until receiving his back injury that ended his career. In June 2004, Slater was convicted for the stabbing of his former girlfriend Theresa Halbert. He was sentenced to one year of house arrest and two years of probation. He blamed the incident on influence from painkillers. Slater died on October 18, 2018 at the age of 67. ==References== ==Other websites== *CWF Archives * Category:1951 births Category:2018 deaths Category:American professional wrestlers Category:American people convicted of assault Category:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida",
