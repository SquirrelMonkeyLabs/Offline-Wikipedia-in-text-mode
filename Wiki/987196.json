 "text": "\"Think It Over\" is a song by American new wave band The Cars, featured on their fourth studio album, Shake It Up. It was written by Ric Ocasek. ==Release== \"Think It Over\" was first released on the 1984 album Shake It Up, but following the album's release the song was released as a single in Britain and Australia. Backed with \"I'm Not the One\" (which later became a hit in its own right) the single made no dent on the charts. The single was not released in America, as the song \"Victim of Love\" (also from Shake It Up) received the single release instead. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Greg Prato cited the track as a highlight from Shake It Up, describing it as \"almost entirely synth-oriented\" and called it one of the \"many lesser-known album tracks [on Shake It Up that] prove[d] to be [a] highlight[.]\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1982 songs Category:The Cars songs",
