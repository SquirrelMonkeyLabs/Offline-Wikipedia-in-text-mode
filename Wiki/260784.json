 "text": "A booby is a seabird in the genus Sula, in the order Suliformes. Boobies are large birds with long pointed wings and bills. They hunt fish and squid by diving into the sea and chasing their prey underwater. Facial air sacs under their skin help protect the impact with the water. Boobies get their name because of their lack of fear of humans. Early mariners named them boobies to denote their believed lack of intelligence. == References == Category:Seabirds Category:Suliformes",
