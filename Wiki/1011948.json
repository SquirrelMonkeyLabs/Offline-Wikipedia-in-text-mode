It located in the constellation Lyra about 980 light years away from us. The Kepler spacecraft that NASA's Kepler Mission used as a satellite found five planets orbiting around this star, and two of them are in the habitable zone, they are called Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f. The furthest planet from the star, called Kepler-62f, is most likely to be a rocky planet. == References == Category:Stars",
