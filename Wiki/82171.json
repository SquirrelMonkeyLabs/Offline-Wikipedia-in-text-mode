 "text": ":For the moon of Jupiter, see Metis (moon). 9 Metis is one of the biggest main belt asteroids. It is made of silicates and metallic nickel-iron, and may be the core remnant of a big asteroid that was destroyed by an ancient collision.M. S. Kelley and M. J. Gaffey, 9 Metis and 113 Amalthea: A Genetic Asteroid Pair, Icarus Vol. 144, p. 27 (2000). == Discovery and naming == Metis was found by Andrew Graham on April 25, 1848; it was his only asteroid discovery.Graham, A.; New Planet, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 8, No. 6 (dated April 14, 1848!), p. 146 (signed April 29, 1848; the discovery was first announced on April 27) It is also the only asteroid to have been found as a result of observations from Ireland. Its name comes from the mythological Metis, a Titaness and Oceanid, daughter of Tethys and Oceanus.Graham, A.; Metis, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 8, No. 7 (dated May 12, 1848), pp. 147 – 150) The name Thetis was also considered and rejected (it would later devolve to 17 Thetis). == Characteristics == Metis' direction of rotation is unknown at present. Hubble space telescope images and lightcurve analyses are in agreement that Metis has a non-spherical stretched shape with one pointed and one broad end. Radar observations suggest the presence of a significant flat area,D. L. Mitchell et al., Radar Observations of Asteroids 7 Iris, 9 Metis, 12 Victoria, 216 Kleopatra, and 654 Zelinda, Icarus Vol. 118, p. 105 (1995). in agreement with the shape model from lightcurves. What the surface is made of has been estimated as 30-40% metal-bearing olivine and 60-70% Ni-Fe metal. Light curve data on Metis led to an assumption that it could have a moon. However, subsequent observations failed to confirm this.research at IMCCE (in French)\"other\" reports of asteroid companions Later searches with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993 found no moons. == Occultations == Metis has been seen to occult stars no less than 5 times.W. M. Kissling et al., The diameter of (9) Metis from the Occultation of SAO 190531, Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia Vol 9, p. 150 (1991). == References == == Other websites == * shape model deduced from lightcurve * \"Notice of discovery of Metis\", MNRAS 8 (1848) 146 * Irish Astronomical History: Markree Castle Observatory and The Discovery of the Asteroid Metis * — Horizons can be used to obtain a current ephemeris.
