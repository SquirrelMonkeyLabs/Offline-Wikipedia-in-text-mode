 "text": "Brian Boucher (born January 2, 1977) is an American analyst and former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played a total of thirteen seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Philadelphia Flyers, Phoenix Coyotes, Calgary Flames, Chicago Blackhawks, Columbus Blue Jackets, San Jose Sharks, and Carolina Hurricanes. ==Career== Before playing in the NHL, Boucher played three seasons with the Tri-City Americans of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He was selected 22nd overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft. He would play three seasons with the Flyers. Boucher would play with the Flyer during the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs and would save a breakaway goal by New Jersey Devils player Patrik Eliáš in a sprawling effort. This would become known as a \"Boosh\" by goaltenders. On June 12, 2002, the Flyers would trade Boucher along with draft picks to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for Michal Handzuš and Robert Esche. During his time with the Coyotes, Boucher was able to spend 332 minutes (five-and-a-half games) without being scored on. At the time, this was an NHL record. On February 1, 2006, the Coyotes traded Boucher along with Mike Leclerc to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Steven Reinprecht and Philippe Sauvé. He would only play three games with the Flames before joining the Chicago Blackhawks. Boucher would only play 15 games with the Blackhawks before being put on waivers. On February 27, 2007, the Columbus Blue Jackets would acquire Boucher off waivers and he would make his debut with them on March 3 in a 4—3 victory against the Phoenix Coyotes. On February 26, 2008, Boucher would sign a one-year contract with the San Jose Sharks. He would play a couple games with them before resigning a one-year; $650,000 contract with the team on June 25. On July 1, 2009, Boucher signed a two-year contract to return to the Philadelphia Flyers. Boucher would play with the Flyers in the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs alongside Michael Leighton. Boucher would help the Flyers defeat Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils four games to one in the first round. Boucher's level of play during the series was called a surprise by hockey media. He would help the team reach the Stanley Cup finals, playing in Games 1 and 5 behind Leighton. The team would lose in the finals to the Chicago Blackhawks fours games to two. On July 1, 2011, Boucher signed a two-year; $950,000 contract with the Carolina Hurricanes. He only played 10 games with them before his season was ended by an injury. In 2013, Boucher retired from playing professional ice hockey. After retiring, Boucher became the regional studio analyst for the Philadelphia Flyers. He would later become the lead color commentator for NBC Sports Philadelphia on September 11, 2023. On August 29, 2023, it was announced that Boucher would become the new lead ice-level analyst at TNT alongside Kenny Albert and Eddie Olczyk. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season=== Season Team League GP W L T OTL MIN GA SO GAA SV% 1993–94 Mount St. Charles Mounties RIIL 15 14 0 1 — 504 8 9 0.57 1994–95 Wexford Raiders MTJHL 8 — 425 23 0 3.25 1994–95 Tri-City Americans WHL 35 17 11 2 — 1969 108 1 3.29 1995–96 Tri-City Americans WHL 55 33 19 2 — 3183 181 1 3.41 .913 1996–97 Tri-City Americans WHL 41 10 24 6 — 2458 149 1 3.64 .901 1997–98 Philadelphia Phantoms AHL 34 16 12 3 — 1901 101 0 3.19 .888 1998–99 Philadelphia Phantoms AHL 36 20 8 5 — 2061 89 2 2.59 .911 1999–00 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 35 20 10 3 — 2038 65 4 1.91 .918 1999–00 Philadelphia Phantoms AHL 1 0 0 1 — 65 3 0 2.77 .903 2000–01 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 27 8 12 5 — 1470 80 1 3.27 .876 2001–02 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 41 18 16 4 — 2295 92 2 2.41 .905 2002–03 Phoenix Coyotes NHL 45 15 20 8 — 2544 128 0 3.02 .894 2003–04 Phoenix Coyotes NHL 40 10 19 10 — 2364 108 5 2.74 .906 2004–05 HV71 SEL 4 0 4 0 — 235 13 0 3.32 .884 2005–06 Phoenix Coyotes NHL 11 3 6 — 0 512 33 0 3.87 .877 2005–06 San Antonio Rampage AHL 6 2 3 — 0 345 8 0 1.39 .950 2005–06 Calgary Flames NHL 3 1 2 — 0 182 15 0 4.95 .854 2006–07 Chicago Blackhawks NHL 15 1 10 — 3 827 45 1 3.26 .884 2006–07 Columbus Blue Jackets NHL 3 1 1 — 0 142 9 0 3.80 .866 2007–08 Philadelphia Phantoms AHL 42 23 16 — 1 2288 94 4 2.47 .917 2007–08 San Jose Sharks NHL 5 3 1 — 1 238 7 1 1.76 .932 2008–09 San Jose Sharks NHL 22 12 6 — 3 1291 47 2 2.18 .917 2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 33 9 18 — 3 1742 80 1 2.76 .899 2009–10 Adirondack Phantoms AHL 1 1 0 — 0 60 2 0 2.00 .935 2010–11 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 34 18 10 — 4 1885 76 0 2.42 .916 2011–12 Carolina Hurricanes NHL 10 1 6 — 1 546 31 0 3.41 .881 2012–13 Adirondack Phantoms AHL 16 6 8 — 1 910 39 0 2.57 .905 2012–13 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 4 0 2 — 0 144 6 0 2.50 .891 2013–14 EV Zug NLA 5 — 309 14 0 2.72 .925 NHL totals 328 120 139 30 15 18,219 822 17 2.71 .901 AHL totals 136 68 47 9 2 7630 336 6 2.64 .915 WHL totals 131 60 54 10 — 7610 438 3 3.45 ===Playoffs=== Season Team League GP W L MIN GA SO GAA SV% 1994 Mount St. Charles Mounties RIIL 4 4 0 180 6 1 1.20 1995 Tri-City Americans WHL 13 6 5 795 50 0 3.77 1996 Tri-City Americans WHL 11 6 5 653 37 2 3.40 1998 Philadelphia Phantoms AHL 2 0 0 30 1 0 1.94 .944 1999 Philadelphia Phantoms AHL 16 9 7 947 45 0 2.85 .906 2000 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 18 11 7 1183 40 1 2.03 .917 2001 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 1 0 0 37 3 0 4.86 .824 2002 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 2 0 1 88 2 0 1.37 .939 2009 San Jose Sharks NHL 1 0 0 2 0 0 0.00 — 2010 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 12 6 6 656 27 1 2.47 .909 2011 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 9 4 4 422 22 0 3.13 .904 NHL totals 43 21 18 2388 94 2 2.36 .911 AHL totals 18 9 7 977 46 0 2.82 .908 WHL totals 24 12 10 1448 87 2 3.60 ===International=== Year Team Event GP W L T MIN GA SO GAA 1996 United States WJC 4 3 1 0 220 13 0 3.55 1997 United States WJC 6 4 1 1 357 9 2 1.51 Junior int'l totals Junior int'l totals Junior int'l totals 10 7 2 1 577 22 2 2.29 ==References== ==Other websites== * * Brian Boucher's profile at Hockey Goalies Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Adirondack Phantoms players Category:American ice hockey goaltenders Category:Calgary Flames players Category:Carolina Hurricanes players Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Columbus Blue Jackets players Category:National Hockey League broadcasters Category:Philadelphia Flyers players Category:Philadelphia Phantoms players Category:Phoenix Coyotes players Category:San Antonio Rampage players Category:San Jose Sharks players Category:Sportspeople from Rhode Island Category:Tri-City Americans players Category:Swedish Hockey League players",
