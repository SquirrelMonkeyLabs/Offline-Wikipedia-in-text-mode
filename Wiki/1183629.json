 "text": "HB11 Energy is a nuclear fusion company in Australia. It is working on a new way to create clean energy using hydrogen and boron. This kind of fusion makes little or no radioactive waste. The company uses high-powered lasers to start the fusion process. This is different from other types of fusion, which usually use very strong magnets or heating systems. HB11 Energy says their method could be safer and cheaper than other fusion ideas. ==References== * Official website Category:Energy companies",
