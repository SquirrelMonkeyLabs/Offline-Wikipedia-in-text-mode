 "text": "Fuente's Powakka tree frog (Boana fuentei) is a group of frogs that live in Suriname. Over the past fifteen years, some scientists have written papers saying this is the same frog as Boana crepitans and others think it is the same as the frog Boana xerophylla. Now, scientists call it a population, meaning the frogs themselves are not different enough from other Boana xerophylla frogs to be a subspecies. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
