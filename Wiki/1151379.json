 "text": "Banco GGAL S.A., operating commercially as Galicia M치s is an Argentine commercial and financial services bank that was formed following the final acquisition of HSBC Bank Argentina by Grupo Financiero Galicia. The rebranding of HSBC to Galicia M치s was completed on December 6, 2024, at midnight. ==History== On April 9, 2024, Grupo Financiero Galicia acquired the Argentine subsidiary of HSBC for 550 million dollars. On September 13, 2024, the Central Bank approved the sale of HSBC Bank Argentina to Grupo Financiero Galicia. As a result of the acquisition by Galicia Financial Group, on December 6, 2024, at 7:00 p.m., HSBC Argentina disconnected from the global HSBC Group network and progressively switched to the Galicia M치s, officially ceasing to exist in Argentina after 32 years of uninterrupted operations in the country. With this brand change, a chapter closes in the history of HSBC in Argentina, an entity that, over more than three decades, left a significant mark on the Argentine financial system. ==References== Category:Banks of Argentina",
