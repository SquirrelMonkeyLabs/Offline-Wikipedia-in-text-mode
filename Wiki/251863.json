 "text": "The poem First they came... was written by Martin Niemöller. It is a criticism of the way people in Nazi Germany did not stop the Nazi Party from treating other people poorly. The poem is as follows: ::First they came for the Communists, :: and I didn’t speak up, :: because I wasn’t a Communist. ::Then they came for the Jews, :: and I didn’t speak up, :: because I wasn’t a Jew. ::Then they came for the Catholics, :: and I didn’t speak up, :: because I was a Protestant. ::Then they came for me, :: and by that time there was no one :: left to speak up for me. == References == Category:Nazi Germany Category:20th- century poems Category:1946 works Category:German literature de:Martin Niemöller#Zitat",
