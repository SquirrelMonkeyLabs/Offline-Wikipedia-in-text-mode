 "text": "A single is when the batter safely reaches first base by hitting a fair ball and getting to first base before a fielder puts him out. As an exception, a batter-runner reaching first base safely is not credited with a single when an infielder attempts to put out another runner on the first play; this is one type of a fielder's choice. Also, a batter-runner reaching first base on a play due to a fielder's error trying to put him out at first base or another runner out (as a fielder's choice) is not credited with a single. ==Singles leaders, Major League Baseball== ===Career=== # Pete Rose - 3215 # Ty Cobb - 3053 # Eddie Collins - 2643 # Cap Anson - 2598 # Willie Keeler - 2513 # Honus Wagner - 2422 # Rod Carew - 2404 # Tris Speaker - 2383 # Tony Gwynn - 2378 # Paul Molitor - 2366 ===Season=== # Ichiro Suzuki () - 225 # Willie Keeler (1898) - 206 # Ichiro Suzuki () - 203 # Lloyd Waner () - 198 # Willie Keeler (1897) - 193 ==References== Category:Baseball Category:Sports words",
