It is a steel bridge with two more recent pedestrian bridges on either side. These were named the Golden Jubilee Bridges, but are really just footpaths alongside the railway bridge. Each footpath has steps and lift access. The north end of the bridge is Charing Cross station. It is near Embankment Pier and the Victoria Embankment. The south end is near Waterloo station, County Hall, the Royal Festival Hall, and the London Eye. The first version of the bridge was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and opened in 1845. The bridge and the walkways have been reworked and expanded at various times. ==Gallery== Image:Charing Cross Bridge, Monet.jpg|Charing Cross Bridge, Claude Monet, 1899 File:Hungerford.bridge.arp.750pix.jpg|Hungerford Bridge seen from the London Eye ==Related pages == * List of crossings of the River Thames ==References== ==Other websites== Category:Bridges in London Category:Steel bridges",
