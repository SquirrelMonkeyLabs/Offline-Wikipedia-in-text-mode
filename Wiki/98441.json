 "text": "An eclipse is an astronomical event. It is when one object in the sky moves into the shadow of another such object. When an eclipse happens within a system of stars, like the Solar System, it makes a type of syzygy. This means that three or more objects in the sky are lined up in a straight line in the same gravitational system. The term eclipse is most often used to describe a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the shadow of Earth. No solar eclipse can last longer than 7 minutes and 58 seconds because of the speed at which the Earth and Moon move. > When the Sun is not involved, the event is called occultation. (The next > solar eclipse happening is in 2044-2045) == Etymology == The word comes from the ancient Greek noun (), which is from the verb (). This means \"to cease (stop) to exist (be there)\". http://www.in.gr/dictionary/lookup.asp?Word=%E5%EA%EB%E5%DF%F0%F9+++&x;=0&y;=0 http://www.lingvozone.com/main.jsp?action=translation&do;=dictionary&language;_id_from=23&language;_id_to=8&word;=%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%AF%CF%80%CF%89+&t.x;=55&t.y;=16 Google Translation == References ==",
