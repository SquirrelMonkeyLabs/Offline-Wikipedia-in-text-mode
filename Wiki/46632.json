It is the oldest football team in Spain. == The Club == Real Club Recreativo de Huelva is a Spanish football team formed on December 23 1889. This makes it the oldest football team in Spain, formed by Dr McKay and overseas British workers at the Rio Tinto mines. Originally named Huelva Recreation Club. Due to its long-standing existence (it is the oldest surviving team of Spanish professional soccer), the team is often referred to as El Decano (\"the dean\") of the Spanish football fraternity. Commonly known as Recre, they play in white with blue vertical stripes and white shorts. Their home ground is the Nuevo Colombino stadium that seats 19,860. After three seasons in Segunda División (Spanish second division), Recre achieved promotion to top flight after beating Numancia Soria on June 4, 2006, mathematically securing promotion with two matches left to be played. El Decano is again among the elite of Spanish football for the 2006/07 season. == Name == * 1889-? Huelva Recreation Club * ?-present R.C.
