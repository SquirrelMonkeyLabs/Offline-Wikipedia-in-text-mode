 "text": "The Secretary of War was a member of the United States President's Cabinet, beginning with George Washington's administration. A similar position, called either \"Secretary at War\" or \"Secretary of War,\" was appointed to serve the Congress of the Confederation under the Articles of Confederation between 1781 and 1789. Benjamin Lincoln and later Henry Knox held the position. When Washington was inaugurated as the first president under the Constitution, he appointed Knox to continue serving. The Secretary of War led the War Department. At first, he was responsible for all military affairs. In 1798, the Secretary of the Navy was added to the cabinet, and the scope of this office was reduced to a general concern with the Army. In 1947, the departments were recombined under the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of War was replaced by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, non-Cabinet positions under the Secretary of Defense. ==Secretaries of War== # Picture Name State of Residence Began Service Ended Service President(s) served under 1 Henry Knox Massachusetts September 12, 1789 December 31, 1794 George Washington 2 Timothy Pickering Pennsylvania January 2, 1795 December 10, 1795 Washington 3 James McHenry Maryland January 27, 1796 May 13, 1800 Washington John Adams 4 Samuel Dexter Massachusetts May 13, 1800 January 31, 1801 John Adams 5 N/A Henry Dearborn Massachusetts March 5, 1801 March 4, 1809 Thomas Jefferson 6 William Eustis Massachusetts March 7, 1809 January 13, 1813 James Madison 7 John Armstrong, Jr. Pennsylvania January 13, 1813 September 27, 1814 Madison 8 James Monroe Virginia September 27, 1814 March 2, 1815 Madison 9 William Harris Crawford Georgia August 1, 1815 October 22, 1816 Madison 10 John Caldwell Calhoun South Carolina October 8, 1817 March 4, 1825 James Monroe 11 James Barbour Virginia March 7, 1825 May 23, 1828 John Quincy Adams 12 Peter Buell Porter New York May 23, 1828 March 4, 1829 J.
