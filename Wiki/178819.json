 "text": "The Falklands War () was a war between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. The Falkland Islands are 480 kilometres from Argentina in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Argentina and the United Kingdom have argued over which country the Falklands Islands belongs to since the 1800s. In the 1760s and 1770s, the British set up a town at Port Egmont, which nearly led to a war with Spain who had a town at Port Louis. Then Argentina became a separate country from Spain in 1817 and set up a colony on the islands (which they call \"Malvinas\") in 1820. An American warship later destroyed this town, and the British took the islands again in 1833. == 1982 == The British kept the islands until Argentinian Special Forces invaded on 2 April 1982 and took control of the island. The United Nations Security Council asked Argentina to withdraw, and tried to end the crisis with diplomacy. After seven weeks, Argentina did not withdraw, so the British Armed Forces traveled more than 12,000 km to attack. After a short battle in the air and at sea, the British landed on 21 May and fought on land until Argentina's army surrendered on 14 June. The British captured 11,313 soldiers, and killed about 650. Almost half of these Argentinian deaths were when the warship ARA General Belgrano was sunk by the British submarine HMS Conqueror. In total there were 258 British deaths including 20 sailors dead and 26 wounded in the destroyer HMS Sheffield. == Relations after the war == The diplomatic relations between the two countries were broken because of the war. Relations between the two countries came back in 1990. == References == Category:1982 events Category:1982 in the United Kingdom Category:20th century in Argentina Category:Falkland Islands Category:Wars involving the United Kingdom Category:1980s in South America Category:History of British Overseas Territories Category:1980s conflicts",
