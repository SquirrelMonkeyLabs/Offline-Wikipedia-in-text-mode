It is still inhabited mostly by Hungarians. == History == The settlement is first mentioned in a tax register from 1427: at that time it was the property of the Daczó and Drágffy families. Later, the Possays, the Odvarys, and the Kincsyes received estates. The descendants of the Daczó family consistently called themselves Bótfalvi from the 16th century onwards. In 1555, there were about 35 serfs living in 7 serf houses. In 1567, the census took place and found only 6 serf houses, which indicates that the population had been decimated by the plague. In 1599, the settlement consisted of 19 houses. During World War II, fourteen of the men here died on the fronts. In the fall of 1944, the Stalinists took away 3 people, all of whom perished. == Economy == The locals have long had a developed backyard economy: some of the vegetables and fruits they produce are sold at the markets of Uzhhorod.
