 "text": "Mineral exploration is the process undertaken by companies, partnerships or corporations in finding ore (commercially viable concentrations of minerals) for mining. Mineral exploration is intensive, organised and professional mineral prospecting and, though it frequently uses the services of prospecting, the process of mineral exploration on the whole is much more involved. Work includes finding, testing, and surveying the deposit, and determining the value and cost of exploiting it. Category:Minerals",
