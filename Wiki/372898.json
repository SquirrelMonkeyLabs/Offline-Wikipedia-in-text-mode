 "text": "Xerochrysum (or Bracteantha) is a type or genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It was defined by Russian botanist Nikolai Tzvelev in 1990. It was identified before (and takes precedence over) Bracteantha which was described the following year. A 2002 molecular study of the tribe Gnaphalieae found the genus is likely polyphyletic, with X. bracteatum and X. viscosum removed from each other. There are currently 7 recognized species: *Xerochrysum bicolor *Xerochrysum bracteatum (Strawflower or Golden Everlasting; syn. Bracteantha bracteata) *Xerochrysum collierianum A.M.Buchanan & Schah. *Xerochrysum palustre (Swamp Everlasting) *Xerochrysum papillosum (Labill.) R.J.Bayer *Xerochrysum subundulatum (Alpine Everlasting or Orange Everlasting) *Xerochrysum viscosum (Sticky Everlasting) The genus was formerly included in Helichrysum.
