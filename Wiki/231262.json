 "text": "A strawberry is a short plant in the wild strawberry genus of the rose family. It is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria. The name is used for its very common sweet edible \"fruit\" and for flavors that taste like it. The real fruit of the plant are the tiny \"seeds\" around the \"fruit\". The fruit is actually a sweet swelling of the plant's stem around the real fruit, which people call the pips. Although in its name, strawberries are actually not berries. The plant grown today is a mix of two other species of wild strawberries. It was first grown in the 1750s. ==Name== The Latin name of the strawberry used in science is × . is the name of the genus of \"strawberry- like\" plants. The × mark means that it is a hybrid, a mix of two other species. The Latin name says the hybrid is \"pineapple-like\". The strawberry is sometimes called the \"gardenstrawberry\" so that people don't mix it up with the other wild strawberries of the genus . The name is a bit misleading and is special to English. The other Germanic languages do not have a name like it. No one is really sure where the name came from.. The plant is not a kind of straw, and its fruit is not really a berry. ==History== People have eaten different kinds of wild strawberries for thousands of years. Today's bigger strawberry was first made around Brest in Brittany (northwest France) in the 1750s. It was made by joining the Virginia strawberry from eastern North America to the European Hautbois and the Chilean strawberry from western South America.. ==Farming== Most strawberries are grown on farms. Strawberry farmers often have bees in hives. The bees pollinate the strawberries. Strawberry stems are called runners. They grow above ground. They are a type of stolon. ==Fruit== The real fruit of the strawberries are the achenes, which people usually think of as the little seeds around the outside of the larger red \"fruit\". This kind of fruit, where different ovaries grow into a single larger \"fruit\", is called an \"aggregate fruit\". Strawberries are rich in vitamin C and manganese. ==Related pages== * Wild strawberry ==References== ==Other websites== *",
