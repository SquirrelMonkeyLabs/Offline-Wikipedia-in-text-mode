 "text": "Alkali Ridge, also known as Alkali Point, is a set of widely scattered archaeological remains of the earliest forms of Puebloan architecture. They represent a period of change from scattered, pit-style dwellings to a settled agricultural lifestyle. These multi-story buildings and kivas have yielded high-quality ceramics. They form the type location for the Pueblo II period (ca. 900 CE - ca. 1100 CE). It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. ==References== ==Other websites== *BLM page on the Alkali Ridge area Category:History of Utah Category:National Historic Landmarks of the United States Category:Archaeological sites in the United States",
