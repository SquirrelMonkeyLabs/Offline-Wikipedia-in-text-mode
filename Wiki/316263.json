The country was created as a separate British Crown Colony from the Straits Settlements about three months before the start of the 1948 Summer Olympics. It sent a team to the Games until 1964. At that time, Singapore was part of Malaysia. The team from Malaysia included people from Singapore. When Singapore became independent from Malaysia in 1965, the country began sending its own team again. It sent a team for every summer games after then, except in 1980. The country boycotted the 1980 games along with many other countries. No athletes from Singapore have been in any Winter Olympic Games. == Olympic medals == The country has won four Olympic medals. The first medal was won by Tan Howe Liang, who won a silver medal in lightweight weightlifting in 1960. In table tennis, Jing Jun Hong and Li Jiawei came close to winning medals in Sydney in 2000. They finished in fourth place. They also finished fourth in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Singapore sent many athletes to the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
