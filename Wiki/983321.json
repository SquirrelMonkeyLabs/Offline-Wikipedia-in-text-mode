 "text": "The Sahrawi peseta (, ) is the currency of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. It is divided in 100 céntimos. One céntimos coins have never been minted. No banknotes have been printed. The first coins were minted in 1990. They did not become the national coin of Western Sahara until 1997. This territory is mostly controlled by Morocco. The currency in that part of the country is the Moroccan dirham. The Algerian dinars, Mauritanian ouguiyas and the Sahrawi peseta are used in the Sahrawi refugee camps and the SADR- controlled part of Western Sahara. Because the coins are not an official currency and are not circulating, the exchange rate is not realistic. Despite this, the Sahrawi peseta was pegged to the Spanish peseta. When the Spanish peseta was replaced with the euro, the rate became €1 for 166.386 Pts. == References == Category:Currency of Africa Category:Western Sahara",
