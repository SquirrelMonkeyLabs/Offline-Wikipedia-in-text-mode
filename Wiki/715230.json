 "text": "The Cabbage Patch Kids are a line of soft-sculptured dolls. They were registered in the United States' copyright office in 1978 as 'The Little People'. When the dolls went into mass production in 1982, they were then renamed 'Cabbage Patch Kids'. The doll brand was one of the most popular toy trends of the 1980s. It was one of the longest running doll franchises in the United States. The characters showed up in many other Cabbage Patch products, including animated cartoons, board games and record albums. Over the years, the Cabbage Patch Kids have been produced by different companies. ==References== Category:Dolls",
