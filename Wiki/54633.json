 "text": "A liturgy is a ceremony, according to the traditions of a particular group or event. In religion, it may mean an elaborate formal ritual (such as the Catholic Mass), or a daily activity such as the Muslim Salats.Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, p.582-3) Anglican, Orthodox, Lutheran, or other groups, when using the words \"the liturgy\", normally mean a standardized order of events observed during a religious service, often including the Eucharist or Communion. The open or waiting worship of Quakers is an example of a non- liturgical service because there is no structured order of events. ==Related pages== *Christian liturgy == Notes == ==References== *Bowker, John, ed.
