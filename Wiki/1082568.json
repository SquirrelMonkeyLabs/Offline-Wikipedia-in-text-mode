 "text": "Shih Shu-tuan (; born 5 April 1952, in Lukang, Taiwan), is a Taiwanese feminist writer. She also uses the pen name Li Ang (). She finished her studies in philosophy at Chinese Culture University and she later studied drama at the University of Oregon. Li Ang then returned to teach at her old university. Her main work is The Butcher's Wife (殺夫: 1983, tr. 1986), but she has written many other novels. Her stories often contain feminist themes and sexuality, and many take place in Lukang.Haddon, Rosemary, From Pulp to Politics: Aspects of Topicality in Fiction by Li La Ang Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, vol. 13, no. 1, pp.36-72Li Ang , Guest Writers, 11th International Conference on the Short Story in English, York University ==Career== The Butcher's Wife criticizes traditional Chinese patriarchy. The story tells about a female character who is forced into marriage with a much older, cruel butcher by her dead father's brother. The butcher abuses her sexually and scares her in various ways, such as a visit to the slaughterhouse. In a confused state, the main character in the end, kills him with a butcher's knife. Li Ang is famous for her unique, honest, and deep insights into gender politics in modern Taiwan society. She started writing when she was just 16 years old and has since written nearly twenty novels and collections of short stories. Her works mainly tell about women's issues such as sexuality during adolescence, feminism, gender roles, and female experiences. For her courage in using topics that are often considered \"hard to talk about\" Taiwanese culture, critics both in China and around the world praised her. Her books have been translated into many languages and are sold worldwide. Major newspapers like The New York Times told about her books and some films and television series used them. In 2004, Li Ang received the “Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres” from the French Minister of Culture and Communication for her important contributions to global literature. ==Works== This is a complete list of Li Ang's works published in Taiwan as well as the English translations of her work. ===Novels=== * 1977 《人間世》The Secular World (Taipei: Dahan Publisher) * 1982 《愛情試驗》Test of Love (Taipei: Hongfan Bookstore) * 1983 《殺夫：鹿城故事》The Butcher’s Wife (Taipei: Linking Books) * 1984 《她們的眼淚》Their Tears (Taipei: Hongfan Bookstore) * 1985 《花季》Flower Season (Taipei: Hongfan Bookstore) * 1985 《暗夜》Dark Night (Taipei: China Times Publisher) * 1986 《一封未寄的情書》A Love Letter Never Sent (Taipei: Hongfan Bookstore) * 1988 《年華》The Best Years (Taipei: Hongfan Bookstore) * 1991 《迷園》Mysterious Garden (Taipei: Maotun famai Co.) * 1991 《甜美生活》Sweet Life (Taipei: Hongfan Bookstore) * 1992 《李昂集》Selected Works by Li Ang (Taipei: Avanguard) * 1997 《北港香爐人人插：戴貞操帶的魔鬼系列》Beigang Incense Burner of Lust: The Devil with a Chastity Belt Series (Taipei: Rye Field Publishing Co) * 1999 《禁色的暗夜：李昂情色小說集》The Dark Night of Forbidden Desire (Taipei: Crown Publisher) * 2000 《自傳の小說》Autobiography: A Novel (Taipei: Crown Publisher) * 2004 《看得見的鬼》Visible Ghosts (Taipei: Unitas Publisher) * 2005 《花間迷情》Bewitching Love (Taipei: Locus Publishing) * 2007 《鴛鴦春膳》An Erotic Feast for Lovebirds (Taipei: Unitas Publisher) * 2009 《七世姻緣之台灣／中國情人》Marriage in Seven Lives: Entangled Love Affairs of Taiwanese Mainlander (Taiepei: Linking Books) * 2011 《附身》Possession (Taipei: Chiuko) * 2014 《路邊甘蔗眾人啃》Everyone Takes a Bite out of Roadside Sugarcanes (Taipei: Chiuko) ===Prose=== * 1987 《貓咪與情人》A Stray Cat and a Lover (Taipei: China Times Publisher) * 2000 《漂流之旅》Drifting Voyageur (Taipei: Crown Publisher) * 2002 《愛吃鬼》Gourmand (Taipei: Yifan) * 2009 《愛吃鬼的華麗冒險》The Splendid Adventure of a Gourmand (Taipei: Route Culture Co.) * 2013 《愛吃鬼的祕徑：李昂帶路的美食奇妙之旅》A Gourmand’s Secret Footpath (Taipei: Route Culture Co.) * 2014 《李昂的獨嘉美食》Li Ang’s Exclusive Chiayi Cuisines (Chiayi: Cultural Bureau of Chiayi City) ===Other works=== * 1976 《群像─中國當代藝術家訪問》Group of Characters (Taipei: Dahan Publisher)(interview collection) * 1984 《女性的意見》Women’s Opinions (Taipei: China Times Publisher)(newspaper column collection) * 1985 《外遇》Extra- Marital Affairs (Taipei: China Times Publisher)(Fieldwork report) * 1986 《走出暗夜》Walking Out of the Dark Night (Taipei: Avanguard)(newspaper column collection) * 1989 《水鬼城煌》City God: The Water Spirit (Taipei: Yuan-liu Publishing Co)(children's literature) * 1993 《懶人變猴子：賽夏族的故事》Lazy People Turn into Monkeys: Saisiat Folklore (Taipei: Yuan-liu Publishing Co.)(children's literature) * 1993 《施明德前傳》An Early Chapter of Shi Mingde’s Life (Taipei: Avanguard)(biography) * 1994 《李昂說情》Li Ang Talks about Love (Taipei: Maotun famai Co.)(newspaper column collection) ===English translations=== * * * * * * == References == Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Feminist writers Category:Taiwanese novelists",
