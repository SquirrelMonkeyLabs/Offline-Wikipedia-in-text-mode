Dean was White House Counsel for United States President Richard Nixon from July 1970 until April 1973. Dean is known for his role in the cover-up of the Watergate scandal and his testimony to Congress as a witness. His guilty plea to a single felony in exchange for becoming a key witness led to a reduced sentence, which he served at Fort Holabird outside Baltimore, Maryland. After his plea, he was disbarred as an attorney. Afterwards, he became a critic of the Republican Party, Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, and the Iraq War. ==References== ==Other websites== * Worse Than Watergate: Former Nixon Counsel John Dean Says Bush Should Be Impeached Democracy Now!, April 6, 2004, interview with John Dean * Doing Legal, Political, and Historical Research on the Internet Using Blog Forums, Open Source Dictionaries, and More John Dean, Findlaw, September 9, 2005 * Video of John Dean interview by Keith Olbermann on Countdown with Keith Olbermann about Dean's book Conservatives Without Conscience on July 11, 2006, at Crooks and Liars, * Interview comparing Nixon and Donald Trump. * Spartacus Educational Biography * ** Booknotes interview with Dean on Warren G.
