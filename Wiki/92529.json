 "text": "Oberspreewald-Lausitz (Low Sorbian: Wokrejs Górne Błota-Łužyca) is a Kreis (district) in the southern part of Brandenburg, Germany. == Geography == The Spree river runs through the district; along its banks there is the Spreewald, a wooded area and home of several rare animals. The district is part of the historic region of Lusatia. == History == The district was made in 1993 by joining the old districts Calau and Senftenberg and small part of the district Bad Liebenwerda. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows a red bull (the symbol of the Lower Lusatia region), for the former district Calau. The city wall in the bottom part is an old symbol of the Upper Lusatia region, and also represents the former district Senftenberg. The shield with a lion is the symbol of the county of Meißen. This is because the municipalities of the Bad Liebenwerda were part of the county. == Towns and municipalities == Amt-free towns Ämter #Calau #Großräschen #Lauchhammer #Lübbenau #Schwarzheide #Senftenberg #Vetschau Amt-free municipalities #Schipkau 1\\.
