 "text": "Social attitude in Bangladesh is a country where friendships between same-sex individuals are allowed by society; but physical relationship between persons of same gender is not. In the context of homosexuality, it is still taboo in Bangladesh and most Bengali people in society are not familiar with LGBT people and their LGBT rights. In general, a Bangladeshi person who identifies as LGBTI is unlikely to face treatment by the State regime, which is sufficiently serious either by its nature or repetition, or by an accumulation of measures, to amount to persecution or serious harm. The onus is on the person to demonstrate otherwise. Societal attitudes towards LGBTI people tend to be conservative and influenced by traditional cultural and religious values. LGBTI persons are often stigmatized, leading to discrimination, social exclusion and hostility. Many face pressure to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity to avoid harassment and violence. Gay men and lesbians are compelled by family and society to enter into heterosexual marriages. While there are supportive allies and groups working for tolerance and equality, progress in acceptance and rights is limited. Bangladeshis who identifies as LGBTI and is open about their sexual orientation or gender identity is likely to face treatment by non-state actors. Given that Homophobic attitudes is prevalent throughout the country there is unlikely to be any place in Bangladesh to which a lesbian, gay or bisexual person could reasonably relocate without making fundamental changes to their lifestyle choices.
