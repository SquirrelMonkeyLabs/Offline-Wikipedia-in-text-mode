 "text": "I'm not an angel is Natalia's first studio album, published by Vale Music in March 2002 in Spain. Natalia became the first contestant on the first edition of Operación Triunfo to see her biggest dream come true: to triumph in the music world with her own album. This album was recorded and produced entirely in London with one of the most sought-after musicians/producers of today: Brian Rawling, responsible for some of the hits of Cher, Enrique Iglesias, Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston and Natalie Cole, among others. The album, which is very much in the vein of artists like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, is very commercial and is eminently a work of pop music designed to be danced to. Obviously, it also has its Latin touch à la Jennifer Lopez (\"The Night Came\"). On her debut, Natalia includes two songs sung in English: \"You Got Me Going Crazy\" and \"Crazy Tonight.\"",
