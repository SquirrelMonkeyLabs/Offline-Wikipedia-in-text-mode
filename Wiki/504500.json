 "text": "The Karnak king list, is a list of early Egyptian kings written in stone. It was in the southwest corner of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III. This hall was part of the Karnak Temple Complex, now Luxor, Egypt. It was written during the rule of Thutmose III. It has the names of 61 kings beginning with Sneferu from Egypt's Old Kingdom. Only the names of 39 kings can still be read. One name is not written in a cartouche (a border used around the name of a king). It is not a complete list of the Egyptian Pharaohs. This list has the names of kings of the First and Second Intermediate periods, which are left out in most other king lists. It was first described by James Burton in 1825.Burton, James: \"Excerpta Hieroglypica\", Plate Ia, Cairo, 1825 In 1843, a German group directed by egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius was traveling up the River Nile to Karnak. A French adventurer, Émile Prisse d'Avennes, got there first. he pulled down the wall at night and took away the blocks with the lists. He had these blocks sent to France.\"L'Illustration, Journal Universel\", Vol. VII, p 244-245, Paris 1846Monderson, Frederick. \"Temple of Karnak: The Majestic Architecture of Ancient Kemet\" p. 58 Severely damaged, it is now on show at the LouvreChapelle des ancêtres in the Sully wing, Rez-de-chaussée, Room 12, Catalogue number E13481bis in Paris. ==Drawing of the list== ==The list== This list has the name of the Pharaoh followed by the actual one written on the stone.
