This frog lives on bushes. People have seen it on and near tea farms and in evergreen forests. People have also seen it in places where people have cut down some trees but not all the trees to get wood to build with. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
