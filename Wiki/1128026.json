 "text": "The Puerto Narino rocket frog (Hyloxalus faciopunctulatus) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. Scientists think it could also live in Brazil and Peru. ==Home== This frog lives on the ground in forests. People have seen this frog in places where there is water in the air, but scientists are not sure if this is the only kind of place it can live. People have seen this frog between 40 and 200 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists think this frog has young the same way other frogs in Hyloxalus do: The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying, but they think people might change the places where it lives too much, for example changing forests to farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
