In Australia, employees with intellectual disabilities make up 75% of the ADE workforce. == Canada == In Canada, people are trying to close sheltered workshops. They want people to have supported employment instead. This is when people receive support and help to work a job in the community. They are paid at least minimum wage. For now, many people with intellectual disabilities still work in sheltered workshops. In Canada, most people with intellectual disabilities do not have a job. == Europe == Sheltered workshops are common across Europe. ==References== Category:Disability Category:Segregation Category:Developmental disorders Category:Employment",
