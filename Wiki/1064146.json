The character was created by Charles Nicholas, first appearing in the Fox publication Mystery Men Comics #1 (1939). He was the first Blue Beetle during the Golden Age. He was a vigilante who got powers using Vitamin 2X, and fought crime with a sidekick named Sparky. Charlton Comics reimagined him as Dan Garrett in the Silver Age. He is portrayed as an archaeologist who gains powers from a Blue Beetle Scarab found in Egypt. His student and successor is Ted Kord, although Jaime Reyes is the next to use the Scarab.
