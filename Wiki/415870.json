 "text": "The Skye terrier is a breed of dog. It is medium sized with short legs, a long body, and a large head. It has a long coat of hair that protects the animal from injury and bad weather. It is one of the oldest terrier breeds, and has its origins on the Isle of Skye, Scotland. The dog was bred to destroy the pests around farms and livestock. The dog became popular in the 19th century because Queen Victoria made it a favorite. The most famous Skye terrier is Greyfriars Bobby. He stayed beside his master's grave for 14 years, rain or shine. There is a statue and fountain in Edinburgh that remembers him. ==References== * Category:Terriers Category:FCI breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in Scotland Category:Rare dog breeds",
