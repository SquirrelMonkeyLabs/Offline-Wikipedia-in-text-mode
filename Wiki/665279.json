The iPod Touch 6 can do many things that iPhones can do except it cannot use cellular data (which is required for making calls or texting without WiFi). Critics praise the iPod Touch 6 as a cheap device that produces good quality photos, though they criticize the iPod Touch 6 for having a bad battery life and a small screen. ==References== Category:Apple hardware Category:IPod Category:Apple products released in 2015",
