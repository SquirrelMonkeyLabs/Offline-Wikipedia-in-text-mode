 "text": "Rest mass (physics), the mass of something that is not moving. All matter has some rest mass. Energy, such as light or kinetic energy (the energy of a moving object) has no rest mass because it causes no change in spacetime in a frozen time frame. However, energy affects mass while time passes; therefore, it affects spacetime, so it has mass. ==References== Category:Relativity",
