 "text": "Public journal (official gazette, official journal, or official diary) is the daily record of the work of an official public organization, especially of legislatures of countries and/or its administrative divisions. Journals of this sort are also often called gazettes (state or government newspapers). In some countries, the publication in the official journal is a condition for a law to \"come into effect\" or \"come into force\" (in which the law becomes a reality), so that people know the law (or treaty) exists, which generally releases it into the public domain. But sometimes a public journal is not always released into the public domain. == Public journal by country == *Albania: Fletorja Zyrtare *Azerbaijan: Azərbaycan *Belgium: Belgian Official Journal *Canada: Canada Gazette *Egypt: Al-Waqa'i'a al-Masriya *Estonia: Riigi Teataja *European Union: Official Journal of the European Union *European Union: Official Journal of the European Patent Office *Finland: Virallinen lehti *France: Journal Officiel de la République Française *Greece: Journal of Government *India: The Gazette of India *Iraq: Official Gazette of Iraq *Ireland: Iris Oifigiúil *Israel: Reshumot *Italy: Gazzetta Ufficiale *Mexico: Diario Oficial de la Federación *Portugal: Diário da República *Romania: Monitorul Oficial *South Africa: Government Gazette of South Africa *Spain: Boletín Oficial del Estado *Sweden: Post- och Inrikes Tidningar *Thailand: Royal Thai Government Gazette *The Czech Republic: Sbírka zákonů *Turkey: TC Resmi Gazete *United Kingdom: London Gazette, Edinburgh Gazette and Belfast Gazette *United States: Federal Register Category:Publications Category:Government Category:Law",
