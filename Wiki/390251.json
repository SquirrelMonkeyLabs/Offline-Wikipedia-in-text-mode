 "text": "An airliner is a type of transport aircraft for transporting passengers and air cargo. Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines, and faster than ships or trains. The largest airliners are jet aircraft called \"wide-body aircraft\". These aircraft are frequently called twin-aisle aircraft because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These aircraft are usually used for long-haul flights between airline hubs and major cities with many passengers. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the \"narrow-body aircraft\" or single aisle aircraft. These smaller airliners are generally used for short to medium- distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts. == Gallery == File:Astraeus.commons.b737-300.g-stra.arp.2.jpg|A Boeing 737-300 narrow-body airliner File:Airbus A380-841, Qantas (Airbus Industrie) AN0958825.jpg|An Airbus A380, the world's largest wide-body airliner File:G-CSVS Boeing 757-236 DHL (Tasman Cargo Airlines) (9971633533).jpg|A Boeing 757 cargo airliner File:SSJ100 for Interjet - Interiors (9015054999).jpg|The cabin of a narrow-body airliner, with only 1 aisle File:Boeing 767-360-ER, Ethiopian Airlines AN0715739.jpg|The cabin of a wide- body airliner, with 2 aisles == References == Category:Aircraft",
