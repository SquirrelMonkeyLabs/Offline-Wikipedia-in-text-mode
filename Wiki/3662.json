 "text": "A vector is a mathematical object that has a size, called the magnitude, and a direction. It is often represented by boldface letters (such as \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}), or as a line segment from one point to another (as in \\overrightarrow{AB}). For example, a vector would be used to show the distance and direction something moved in. When asking for directions, if one says \"Walk one kilometer towards the North\", that would be a vector, but if they say \"Walk one kilometer\", without showing a direction, then that would be a scalar. We usually draw vectors as arrows. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's magnitude. The direction in which the arrow points to is the vector's direction. ==Examples of vectors== * John walks north 20 meters. The direction \"north\" together with the distance \"20 meters\" is a vector. * An apple falls down at 10 meters per second. The direction \"down\" combined with the speed \"10 meters per second\" is a vector. This kind of vector is also called velocity. ==Examples of scalars== * The distance between two places is 10 kilometers. This distance is not a vector because it does not contain a direction. * The number of fruit in a box is not a vector. * A person pointing is not a vector because there is only a direction. There is no magnitude (the distance from the person's finger to a building, for example). * The length of an object. * A car drives at 100 kilometers per hour. This does not describe a vector, as there is only a magnitude, but no direction. ==More examples of vectors== * Displacement is a vector. Displacement is the distance that something moves in a certain direction. A measure of distance alone is a scalar. * Force that includes direction is a vector. * Velocity is a vector, because it is a speed in a certain direction. * Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. An object is accelerating if it is changing speed or changing direction. ==How to add vectors== ===Adding vectors on paper using the head to tail method=== The Head to Tail method of adding vectors is useful for doing an estimate on paper of the result of adding two vectors. To do it: * Each vector is drawn as an arrow with an amount of length behind it, where each unit of length on the paper represents a certain magnitude of the vector. * Draw the next vector, with the tail(end) of the second vector at the head(front) of the first vector. * Repeat for all further vectors: Draw the tail of the next vector at head of the previous one. * Draw a line from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector - that's the resultant(sum) of all the vectors. It's called the \"Head to Tail\" method, because each head from the previous vector leads in to the tail of the next one. ===Using component form=== Using the component form to add two vectors literally means adding the components of the vectors to create a new vector. For example, let a and b be two two-dimensional vectors. These vectors can be written in terms of their components. \\mathbf{a} = ( a_x, a_y ) \\mathbf{b} = ( b_x, b_y ) Suppose c is the sum of these two vectors, so that c = a \\+ b. This means that \\mathbf{c} = ( a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y ). Here is an example of addition of two vectors, using their component forms: \\mathbf{a} = ( 3, -1 ) \\mathbf{b} = ( 2, 2 ) \\begin{align}\\mathbf{c} & = \\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b} \\\\\\ & = ( a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y ) \\\\\\ & = ( 3 + 2, -1 + 2 ) \\\\\\ & = ( 5, 1 ) \\end{align} This method works for all vectors, not just two dimensional ones. ==How to multiply vectors== ===Using the dot product=== The dot product is one method to multiply vectors. It produces a scalar. It uses component form: \\begin{align}\\mathbf{a} & = (2, 3)\\\\\\ \\mathbf{b} & = (1, 4) \\\\\\ \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} & = (2,3)\\cdot(1,4) \\\\\\ & = (2\\cdot 1)+(3\\cdot 4) \\\\\\ & = 2+12 \\\\\\ &= 14 \\end{align} ===Using the cross product=== The cross product is another method to multiply vectors. Unlike dot product, it produces a vector. Using component form: \\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}=|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\sin(\\theta) \\mathbf{n} Here, |\\mathbf{a}| means the length of \\mathbf{a}, and \\mathbf{n} is the unit vector at right angles to both \\mathbf{a} and \\mathbf{b}. ===Multiplying by a scalar=== To multiply a vector by a scalar (a normal number), you multiply the number by each component of the vector: c\\,\\mathbf{x} = (c\\,x_1,c\\,x_2,...,c\\,x_n) An example of this is \\begin{align}c & = 5\\\\\\ \\mathbf{x} & = (3,4)\\\\\\ c\\,\\mathbf{x} & = (5\\cdot3, 5\\cdot4)\\\\\\ & = (15, 20) \\end{align} ==Related pages== * Analytic geometry * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors * Null vector * Unit vector * Vector field * Vector graphics * Vector space * Vector subspace ==References== Category:Basic physics ideas",
