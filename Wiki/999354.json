 "text": "The 1936- 37 Austrian Cup was Austria's football cup competition. FK Austria Wien were the defending champions. With the participation of the autumn champions of 1936 from the federal states of Upper Austria and Styria, as well as the two teams from Lower Austria that were leading in the autumn of 1936, an Austrian Cup was held for the second time after 1935/36 instead of the previous Vienna Cup. The clubs in the 2nd division successfully protested against the previous practice of automatically granting home advantage to the first division teams in matches between teams in the 1st and 2nd division. From 1936/37 the home advantage in such games was also possible for the second division teams, but their place had to be commissioned for first-class games.Austria Soccer.at ==Third round== Mars waived the drawn home advantage. *Replay matches: ==Fourth round== *Replay matches: ==Round of 32== *First round with teams from the first league and the federal states Ostbahn waived the drawn homeadvantage.
