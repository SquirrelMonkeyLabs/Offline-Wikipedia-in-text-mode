Their first year, they tied the Lincoln Tree Planters for last place at 31-49. In 1887, the Soldiers were 27-27 when they disbanded on July 8 due to poor attendance. In 1888, Leavenworth returned to the loop and went 7-7 under L. M. Cretors. They were in second place when the league stopped operations on June 21. A J. Curran was leading the club in batting average at .300. ==References== *The Western League: A Baseball History, 1885 through 1999 by W.C. Madden and Patrick Stewart. .
