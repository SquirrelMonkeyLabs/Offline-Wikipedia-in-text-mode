The actions were focused on the person of the minister and were aimed at displacing Avakov from the position of Minister of Internal Affairs. The first action took place on August 28, 2019 as a result of President Zelenskyi's decision to leave Avakov in Honcharuk's government (Avakov was the minister since 2014 in Ukraine). == References == Category:2010s protests Category:2020 protests Category:2021 protests Category:2010s in Ukraine Category:2020s in Ukraine",
