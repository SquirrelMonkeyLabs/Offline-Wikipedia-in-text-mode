 "text": "In mathematics, analytic number theory is a part of number theory that uses ideas from mathematical analysis to solve questions about whole numbers. It is believed to have started in 1837 when Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet used Dirichlet L-functions to give the first proof of Dirichlet's theorem about arithmetic progressions. This branch of math is well-known for its work on prime numbers (like the Prime Number Theorem and the Riemann zeta function) and on additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring's problem). == Branches of analytic number theory == Analytic number theory has two main parts, based on the type of questions they try to answer. * Multiplicative number theory looks at how prime numbers are spread out, such as counting how many primes are between two numbers. It includes the Prime Number Theorem and Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. * Additive number theory studies how whole numbers can be added together, like Goldbach's conjecture that says every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. One important result in this part is solving Waring's problem. == References == === Citations === Category:Number theory",
