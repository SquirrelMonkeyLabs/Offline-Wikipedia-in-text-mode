 "text": "Indian Wars is the name generally used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between the colonial or federal government and the native people of North America. These wars which ranged from the 17th-century (King Philip's War, King William's War, and Queen Anne's War at the opening of the 18th century) to the Leech Lake uprising in 1898. They generally resulted in the opening of Native American lands to further colonization. They also represent the conquest of American Indians and their assimilation or forced relocation to Indian reservations. The Indian Wars comprised a series of smaller wars. American Indians who were diverse peoples with their own distinct tribal histories, were no more a single people than the Europeans. They lived in societies organized in a variety of ways. American Indians usually made decisions about war and peace at the local level. They sometimes fought as part of formal alliances. One example is the Iroquois Confederation. They also sometimes used temporary confederacies inspired by leaders such as Tecumseh. ==Medal of Honor== The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War. It is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Due to the nature of this medal it is commonly presented after the recipient has been killed (posthumously). ==A== Image Name Service Rank Place of action Date of action Unit Notes Army Brazos River, Texas 41st U.S. Infantry Attacked with 2 men a force of 11 Indians, drove them from the hills, and reconnoitered the country beyond.
