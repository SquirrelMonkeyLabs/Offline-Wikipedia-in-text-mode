 "text": "A biomolecule is any molecule produced by a living organism. That includes large macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as many smaller molecules. Biomolecules are used in biological processes such as cell division, morphogenesis, or development.Bunge M. 1979. Treatise on Basic Philosophy, vol. 4. Ontology II: A World of Systems, p. 61-2. link. Just four elements—oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen—make up 96% of the human body's mass. But many other elements, such as the various biometals, are also present in small (but vital) amounts.

ISBN 0-8153-3218-1 Biometals are at the heart of many biomolecules. One or two atoms of copper, zinc, iron or manganese are in the most important biological molecules.Maret W 2018. (Arruda MA, ed).

Peptide bond Monosaccharides Oligosaccharides Polysaccharides (cellulose...) Glycosidic bond Nucleotides Oligonucleotides Polynucleotides, nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) Phosphodiester bond == References == Category:Biochemistry",
