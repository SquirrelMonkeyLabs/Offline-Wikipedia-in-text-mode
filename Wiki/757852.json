In the episode, Professor Frink makes a new cryptocurrency. The episode was watched by 1.84 million people when it was first shown on television. == Plot == The Simpson family are eating at a vegan restaurant, wanting Lisa to pick them for a project at school. She chooses Professor Frink because he wants to help the world with science. At Springfield University, Lisa interviews Professor Frink. Frink says he is making a new cryptocurrency called Frinkcoin. Frinkcoin becomes well known, making Frink the richest man in Springfield. Mr. Burns is angry because he is no longer the richest man in Springfield. Frink feels lonely, so Marge says that he should go to Moe's Tavern. Frink gets every question correct in Moe's trivia questions, so they become friends with Frink. Frink shows his friends Springfield's best places. Smithers gets a team of people to create a cryptocurrency for Mr. Burns. The team creates an equation to make Frinkcoin worth nothing, but it will take thousands of years to calculate. Instead, Mr. Burns tells Frink that his friends only like him because he is rich. Burns brings the equation to Springfield for a crowdsourcing solution. Frink finds out that his friends only like him because he is rich. Frink solves the equation himself, but only Lisa knows. Frink loses all of his money, but he is happy to be friends with Lisa and to go back to his university. == Reception == Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a score of B and says that the episode \"uses the cryptocurrency concept as an excuse for a largely successful exercise in side- character development.\" Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 out of 5 stars and says \"'Frinkcoin' is a satisfying episode\" and that Lisa and Frink's actions add up to a \"solid half hour investment.\" == References == == Other websites == * Category:The Simpsons (season 31) episodes Category:2020 television episodes",
