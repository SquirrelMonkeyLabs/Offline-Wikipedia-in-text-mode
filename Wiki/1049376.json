 "text": "The undercut is a hair style. It was popular in the 1910s to 1940s and came back in style in the 1980s and 2010s. In this style, the hair on the top of the head is long and the back and sides are shaved short. It is similar to curtained hair from the 1990s. ==History== The undercut has been around for a long time. Even Vikings and some Native Americans wore similar styles. In the past, it was often worn by poor people or gang members. In the 1920s and 1930s, it became a common style for everyone. Soldiers in World War I and in Nazi Germany also had this haircut. It was popular again in the 1960s but then went out of style. ==Revival== The undercut became popular again in the late 1980s and early 2010s. People who liked certain types of music, like new wave and electronic music, started wearing it. Famous people like Macklemore and Kim Jong Un also had this haircut. Some people did not like it because it reminded them of the past, but many people wore it as a fashion statement. Category:Hairstyles",
