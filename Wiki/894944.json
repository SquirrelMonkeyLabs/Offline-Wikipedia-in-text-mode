In the Roman provinces of Judea and Syria Palaestina, Jewish rabbis stopped Jews from taking part in fairs in certain towns because the religious nature of the fairs contravened the prescribed practice of Judaism. In the Middle Ages, many fairs developed as short-lasting markets and were very important for long-distance and international trade. Traders travelled, sometimes for many days, to fairs where they could be sure to meet those they needed to buy from or sell to. Fairs were usually tied to special Christian religious events, such as the Saint's day of the local church. Stagshaw, in England, held annual fairs as early as 1293 consisting of the sales of animals. Along with the main fair held on 4 July, the city also hosted smaller fairs throughout the year where certain types of animals were sold, such as one for horses, one for lambs, and one for ewes. The Kumbh Mela, held every twelve years, at Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain is one of the largest fairs in India, where more than 60 million people gathered in January 2001, making it the largest gathering anywhere in the world.Millions bathe at Hindu festival BBC News, January 3, 2007.Kumbh Mela pictured from space - probably the largest human gathering in history BBC News, January 26, 2001.
