 "text": "MiG-15 Fagot was a jet combat airplane designed by Mikoyan, a Russian airplane company. It was intended as an interceptor but fought more often as an air superiority fighter. It first flew in 1947, and went in military service in 1949. It was one of the first to use a swept wing. It first fought in the Korean War, where it defeated the American Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star. To try to beat the MiG-15, the North American Aviation F-86 Sabre was brought in. The MiG-15 was then upgraded in to the MiG-17, so the MiG-15 went out of service. Today, it is used to train new pilots and still used by North Korea's Air Force. ==Related pages== *Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 *F-86 Sabre == Other websites == * MIG-15 -Citizendium Category:Soviet military aircraft Category:North Korea Category:Korean War Category:1947 establishments Category:Chinese military aircraft",
