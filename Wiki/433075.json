 "text": "The 1982 Lebanon war was part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Lebanese Civil War. It began on 6 June 1982. Israel called it Operation Peace for Galilee. It was later known as the Lebanon war or First Lebanon war. The war started when the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) attacked southern Lebanon. On 3 June 1982 the Abu Nadal Organization tried to assassinate Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov. This may have been done to hurt the PLO's reputation. At the time, however, Israel blamed the PLO for the attempt. The shooting of the ambassador was the trigger that caused Israel’s invasion of Lebanon.Harvey W.
