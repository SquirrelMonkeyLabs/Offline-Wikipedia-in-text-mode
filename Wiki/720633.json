It was named after Francis Marion, a Brigadier General of the American Revolutionary War, known as the \"Swamp Fox\". In 2020, 1,922 people lived there. ==History== ===19th century=== The city of Marion Centre was created in 1860. It became the county seat. A post office was created in Marion Centre on September 30, 1862. It was renamed to Marion on October 15, 1881. The namesake of the city is Francis Marion. As early as 1875, city leaders of Marion had a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and people from Marion County and McPherson County started the Marion and McPherson Railway Company.Marion County Kansas : Past and Present; Sondra Van Meter; MB Publishing House; LCCN 72-92041; 344 pages; 1972. In 1879, a railroad was built from Florence to McPherson. In 1880 it was extended to Lyons. In 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was used by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was left in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, because of heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was left. The original railroad connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, Ellinwood. Later, the Santa Fe depot building became the Marion Library. Most locals still refer to this railroad as the \"Santa Fe\". In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway built a railroad north-south from Herington through Marion to Caldwell. It closed in 1891. It was taken over by Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, which closed in 1980 and became the Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas Railroad. It merged 1988 with Missouri Pacific Railroad. It merged in 1997 with Union Pacific Railroad. Most locals still call this railroad as the \"Rock Island\". In 1888, Marion incorporated as a city. In 1889, the Marion Belt and Chingawasa Springs Railroad built a railroad from Marion north-east to Chingawasa Springs. A hotel was built near the place of the spa at Chingawasa Springs. A depot and restaurant were built too. Both Santa Fe and Rock Island had round trip fares from Chicago and western cities to Chingawasa Springs. The Panic of 1893 closed down the health spa and hotel, and businesses along the tracks never developed well. In 1893, the railroad stopped, and tracks were removed in 1910. ===20th century=== The National Old Trails Road, also called the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was created in 1912, and it went through Lehigh, Hillsboro, Marion and Lost Springs. In 1937, the Marion County Lake was completed by the Civilian Conservation Corps south-east of Marion. It was to be used for recreation. There were many floods during the early history of Marion. In June and July 1951, due to heavy rains, rivers and streams flooded many cities in Kansas, including Marion. Many reservoirs and levees were built in Kansas because of the Great Flood of 1951. From 1964 to 1968, the Marion Reservoir was built north-west of Marion. Downstream from the Marion Reservoir, levees were built in the low areas of Marion and Florence. ===21st century=== In 2010, the Keystone-Cushing Pipeline (Phase II) was built west of Marion, north to south through Marion County.
