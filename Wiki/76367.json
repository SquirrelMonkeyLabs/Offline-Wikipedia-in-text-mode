It is defined as the ratio of reflected to incident electromagnetic radiation. It is a unitless measure indicative of a surface's or body's diffuse reflectivity. The word is derived from albus, a Latin word for \"white\". == Other websites == * Albedo - Encyclopedia of Earth * NASA MODIS Terra BRDF/albedo product site * NASA MODIS BRDF/albedo product site * A discussion of Lunar albedos Category:Optics",
