 "text": "The Future is the ninth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released in 1992. Political events and history are found elsewhere on the album, with Cohen making references to Tiananmen Square, Stalin, World War II and Hiroshima. The title track was originally called \"If You Could See What's Coming Next\", and underwent extensive rewrites, taking up almost sixty pages in Cohen's notebook, while \"Closing Time\" took two years with Cohen even starting over from scratch on the song as late as March 1992. ==References== Category:Leonard Cohen albums Category:1992 albums",
