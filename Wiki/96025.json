This can be pictures of many things on a stamp, like people, animals, boats, insects, and vehicles. Interesting parts of thematic philately also include mistakes in the art of a stamp. For example, the removal of cigarettes from United States stamps. * Postal history studies the history of how mail and stamps were processed. This relates to post offices, postmarks, and how mail is taken from place to place. * Aerophilately studies airmail (mail that travels on planes). * Astrophilately studies stamps that are related to outer space, and objects like the Moon. == Organizations == ;In the United Kingdom * National Philatelic Society UK * Philatelic Traders Society (London) * Royal Philatelic Society London * Welsh Philatelic Society ;In the United States * American First Day Cover Society * American Philatelic Society * American Revenue Association * American Topical Association * National Postal Museum (USA) * Precancel Stamp Society * Old World Archaeological Study Unit ;Other places * Académie Européenne de Philatélie * Fédération Internationale de Philatélie * Scouts on Stamps Society International * GEOPHILA Association of collectors of stamp territories around the world * Wreck & Crash Mail Society * Europe: Small European Postal Administration Cooperation * Argentina: Féderación Argentina de Entidades Filatélicas * Australia: Australian Philatelic Federation * Canada: British North American Philatelic Society * Cyprus: Cyprus Philatelic Society * India: Indian Postal Service * New Zealand: Royal Philatelic Society of New Zealand Inc * Russia: The Rossica Society of Russian Philately * South Africa: Thematic Collecting Group in South Africa * Ukraine: Odessa City Collectors' Society == Related pages == * All-Russian Society of Philatelists * Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily * Philatelic International * Soviet Philatelic Association * Stamp collector * Soviet Philatelist ==Other websites== * Category:Collecting",
