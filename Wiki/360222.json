 "text": "Remington Steele is an American television series co-created by Robert Butler and Michael Gleason. The series starred Stephanie Zimbalist and Pierce Brosnan. It was produced by MTM Enterprises. The first broadcast was on the NBC network from 1982 to 1987. The series blended the genres of romantic comedy, drama, and detective procedural. Remington Steele is best known for starting the career of Pierce Brosnan. It also was a forerunner of the similar series Moonlighting, and was also an influential part of television history in its own right. Remington Steele's premise is that Laura Holt, a licensed private detective, opened a detective agency under her own name. She then found that potential clients would not hire a woman. To solve the problem, Laura invents a fake male superior whom she names Remington Steele. Through a series of events in the first episode a former thief and con man takes the identity of Remington Steele. Behind the scenes, Laura stays firmly in charge. ==Cast== *Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt *Pierce Brosnan as Remington Steele *Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs (from third season, recurring second season) *Janet DeMay as Bernice Foxe (first season) *James Read as Murphy Michaels (first season) *Jack Scalia as Tony Roselli (fifth season) Other recurring actors included: *Cassandra Harris (first wife of Pierce Brosnan) as Felicia, one of Steele's old flames, and Anna, a mysterious woman from Steele's past. *Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (father of Stephanie Zimbalist) as Daniel Chalmers, a charming con man who was Steele's mentor and surrogate father (revealed to be his biological father in the end) and whose real name was unknown.
