This attack was unsuccessful and ended with the failure of the Portuguese forces, who retreated to Pasai (Sumatra).João Paulo de Oliveira e Costa, Vítor Luís Gaspar Rodrigues (2012) Campanhas de Afonso de Albuquerque: Conquista de Malaca, 1511 p. 48 == Action == On July 25, 1511, coinciding with St. James' Day, a Portuguese Armadas fleet led by Afonso de Albuquerque launched an attack on the city of Malacca. They landed in the Upeh area as the locals were performing the dawn prayer (Subuh). The Portuguese focused their attack on the Upeh bridge, a strategic location connecting the parts of the city separated by the river. After completing their prayers, the Malay locals became aware of the attack. The Malaccan forces, including elephant troops and cannon from the palace, were quickly prepared to counter the Portuguese assault. == Aftermath == A fierce battle took place at the Upeh bridge, where the Portuguese troops occupied the bridge. However, cannons from the palace bombarded the bridge, causing exhaustion and heavy losses for the Portuguese forces. Eventually, the Malaccan troops succeeded in recapturing the Upeh bridge. By nightfall, the Portuguese forces retreated, suffering a significant defeat in their initial attack on Malacca. == References == Category:15th-century conflicts Category:Portuguese Empire Category:Malacca City",
