 "text": "Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor particles a few nanometres in size. They have optical and electronic properties which are different from larger particles because of the quantum mechanics. Due to their tiny size, they are able to replicate certain properties of atoms. For example, a change in their size can change the wavelength of light they output. This can be seen in the image to the right. Category:Quantum mechanics",
