Surah An-Nisa has been revealed in Medina . This surah talks about how Muslims should lead their lives and stay united. Click to listen Surah An- Nisa. == Time and content of the revelation == This Surah is the sum of several speeches. Probably from the end of the third Hijri to the end of the fourth Hijri or from the beginning of the fifth Hijri, different parts of it were revealed at different times. Although it is not possible to say exactly from which verse to which verse a revelation was included in a speech and what was the time of its revelation, some provisions and events have been pointed out somewhere to help us know the date of their revelation from tradition. . So with the help of these we can point out a general limit of these speeches containing these provisions and hints. As we know, the provisions regarding the distribution of inheritance and the rights of orphans were revealed after the battle of Uhud. Then seventy Muslims were martyred. As a result of this incident, the question arose as to how the inheritance of the martyrs would be distributed in different houses of the small settlements of Medina and how the interests of the orphans they had left would be preserved. On the basis of this, we can assume that the first four verses, and the first three verses of the fifth verse will have been revealed at this time. We find in the hadith the tradition of reciting the prayer of fear (praying while fighting) in the battle of Jatur Rika. This battle took place in the fourth Hijri. So it can be inferred here that the speech (15 Ruku) in which the rules of prayer have been explained will have been revealed in the near future. Bani Nadir was expelled from Medina in the month of Rabiul Awwal of the fourth Hijri. Therefore, the last warning given to the Jews in this speech, \"Believe me before I disfigure your face,\" can be presumed to have been revealed at a very near time. Tayammum was allowed due to lack of water during the battle of Banil Mustaliq. And this battle took place in the fifth Hijri. Therefore, it should be remembered that the speech in which (7th Ruku) mentioned Tayammum was revealed at that time. == Other websites == * * \"Qur'anic Verses (4: 94-100, 100-105)\" is a digitized manuscript of an-Nisā, dating from the 12th century, from the World Digital Library * Quran 4 Clear Quran translation * Q4:126, 50+ translations, islamawakened.com Category:Chapters in the Quran == Reference ==",
