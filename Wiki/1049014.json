 "text": "The Anamalai bush frog (Roarchestes blandus) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains, between 45 and 806 meters above sea level. This frog lives in evergreen forests that are not too high above sea level. It lives in smaller plants under the trees. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place, only 859 square kilometers, and because human beings still change that place. Human beings build farms for rubber and arecanut. Scientists have seen that the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can make this frog sick, but they do not know if it kills the frog. This frog has been found in two protected parks: Parambikulam Tiger Reserve and Anamalai Tiger Reserve. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
