 "text": "Bill Bottrell (born 27 October 1952) is an American record producer, songwriter and musician, probably best known for his Grammy Award-winning collaboration with Sheryl Crow. During the late 1980s, Bottrell worked with a number of major recording artists, including Madonna and Michael Jackson. In the early 1990s he formed his own recording studio and founded a musical \"think tank\" he called the \"Tuesday Night Music Club\". One of the resulting acts was Sheryl Crow, whose 1993 debut album (produced by Bottrell) was titled Tuesday Night Music Club. Her single \"All I Wanna Do\" from that album won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year for Bottrell and Crow. Bottrell has worked with many other artists, including Alisha's Attic, Rosanne Cash, Thomas Dolby, Five For Fighting, Lisa Germano, Kevin Gilbert, Shelby Lynne, Linda Perry, Tom Petty, and Toy Matinee. ==Other websites== *Bill Bottrell official website Category:1952 births Category:American songwriters Category:American record producers Category:Living people",
