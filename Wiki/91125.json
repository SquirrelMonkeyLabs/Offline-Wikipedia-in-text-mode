Its capital is Les Cayes. == Geography == The Départment du Sud has an area of 2,794 km². It is bordered to the north by the Grand'Anse and Nippes departments, to the east by the Sud-Est Department and by the Caribbean Sea to the west and south. The Massiff de la Hotte, an important Haitian mountain range, runs from west to east along the centre of the department. Because of this, rivers here are short; some of them are Acul du Sud, Torbeck, Ravine du Sud, de l'Ilet, Cavaillon, des Anglais, Port à Piment, Saut Mathurine, de Tiburon. == Population == The department had, in the 2003 census, a population of 621,651 persons: 312,729 men and 308.922 women, with only 109,623 (17.63%) living in cities and towns. == Administrative division == The department is divided into five arrondissements (like districts) and 18 communes (like municipalities). The \"arrondissements\" and their \"communes\" are: # Aquin ## Aquin ## Cavaillon ## Saint-Louis-du-Sud # Les Cayes ## Les Cayes ## Camp- Perrin ## Chantal ## Maniche ## Île-à-Vache ## Torbeck # Les Chardonnières ## Les Chardonnières ## Les Anglais ## Tiburon # Les Côteaux ## Les Côteaux ## Port-à-Piment ## Roche-à-Bateau # Port-Salut ## Port-Salut ## Arniquet ## Saint-Jean-du-Sud == References == Category:Departments of Haiti",
