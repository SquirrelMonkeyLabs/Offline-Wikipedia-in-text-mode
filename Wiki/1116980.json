 "text": "Yessentuki (also spelled as Essentuki; Russian Cyrillic: Ессентуки) is a city in Stavropol Krai in the North Ossetia-Alania Republic in the very southernmost parts of Russia. It is located in the base of Mount Elbrus areas, which is in the Caucasus Mountains areas. == Occupation and mass murders of Jewish people during the ghetto's liquidation process == From August 1942 to January 1943, for about five (5) months, Yessentuki was briefly occupied by Nazi German military army troops, during the German invasion of the Caucausus. A ghetto for Jews in the city was established, where nearly all Jews were shot to death and thus murdered, during the ghetto's liquidation process. Only 11 Jews survived until 11 January 1943, when the city was liberated by the Soviet Bolshevik Red Army, because they had physically worked and labored for the German officers, as medical health professionals.
