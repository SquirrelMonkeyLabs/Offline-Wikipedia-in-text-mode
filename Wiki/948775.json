 "text": "The Nauset people or Cape Cod Indians were a Native American tribe of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. They were part of the Northeastern Woodlands Culture. Their language was part of the Algonquian language family. Their neighbors were the Wampanoag. Natives ate seafood and the Three Sisters (corn, squash and beans). This was one of the first tribes that European colonists visited. The Pilgrim's Mayflower ship made contact with the Nauset people. The Nauset often allied with colonists. Many also became Christians. They intermarried with other tribes. The tribe no longer exists today. The Nauset Archaeological District is a Naitonal Historic Landmark. Samuel de Champlain created a map. In it, he described the Nauset Natives in the Nauset harbor. == References == Category:Native Americans",
