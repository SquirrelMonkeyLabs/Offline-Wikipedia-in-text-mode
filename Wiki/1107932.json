 "text": "The Malabar Indian frog, rufous leaf-hopper frog, GÃ¼nther's frog, spotted leaping frog, or spotted mountain leaping frog (Walkerana diplosticta) is a frog. It lives in India in the Western Ghat mountains. This frog lives on the ground near streams on hills. This frog lives in forests and swamps. People see them sitting on rocks or in grassy places or on the dead leaves on the ground in the forest. People do not see this frog on farms. They see this frog between 90 and 1800 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs on wet rocks. This frog eats earthworms. Scientists believe this frog is in some danger of dying out because people are changing the places where it lives. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve. Every year, people take a religious trip to the part of India where the frog lives. These visitors can bother the frog. Bad chemicals can also kill this frog. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. Because it lives high in mountains, the frog cannot move north when the weather gets hotter the way other animals could. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can also make this frog sick. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
