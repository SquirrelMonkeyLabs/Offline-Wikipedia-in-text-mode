 "text": "Trident Media Guard (TMG) is a French company based in Saint-Sébastien-sur- Loire near Nantes. Founded in 2002 by Alain Guislain and Bastien Casalta, TMG specializes in software designed to prevent unauthorized file copying over the Internet. The company aims to provide services to major publishing companies in the recording and film industry, helping them combat revenue loss from illegal downloads on peer-to-peer networks. TMG works in collaboration with various entities, including Canal Plus, LFP, France Télévisions, and the music and film industry. It was selected in 2010 to address copyright infringements on the Internet as part of the HADOPI law, which involved identifying IP addresses of users engaged in illegal downloading and reporting the information to HADOPI. The company gained attention in 2011 when a server security breach exposed personal data and processing scripts. As a result, TMG underwent audits by CNIL, HADOPI, and HSC, and experienced a disruption in communication with HADOPI. The conclusions of these audits were not publicly disclosed. TMG, along with Thierry Lhermitte, received the Special Mention prize Orwell Internet at the Big Brother Awards 2010, recognizing their efforts in protecting online rights. == References == Category:2002 establishments in France Category:Companies of France",
