 "text": "Naré Maghann Konaté (died c. 1218) was a 12th-century faama (king) of the Mandinka people, in what is today called Mali. He was the father of Sundiata Keita, who founded the Mali Empire, and a character in the oral tradition of the Epic of Sundiata. == The Epic of Sundiata == In the Epic of Sundiata, Naré Maghann Konaté (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a God-related hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Naré Maghann Konaté was already married to Sassouma Berté and had a son by her, Dankaran Touman Keïta. However, when two Traoré hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon, he remembered the prediction and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata, who was unable to walk throughout most of his childhood until 7 years old. Category:Malian people Category:1218 deaths Category:12th-century births",
