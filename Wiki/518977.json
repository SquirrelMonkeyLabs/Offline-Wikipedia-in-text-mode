Her parents were Henrietta Howland Robinson and Edward Henry Green. Her brother was Edward Howland Robinson Green (1868–1936).

When her brother died in 1935, she inherited his estate, rather than the estate going to his widow. She died on February 5, 1951 leaving an estate of $94,965,229 ($443 million in 2007 dollars). The list of assets included 36 pages of bonds, eight pages of blue chip stocks, and $31 million in a non- interest bearing checking account. Her will was found in a tin cabinet with four bars of soap. She gave just $5,000 to her closest genetic relative, a cousin, but the court awarded her $140,000 during probate. The rest was divided between 63 charities and educational institutions. ==References== Category:1871 births Category:1951 deaths Category:People from Hoboken, New Jersey",
