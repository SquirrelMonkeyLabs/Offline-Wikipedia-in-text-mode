Meowth does appear in Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Brawl but only as a Pokéball Pokémon. Master Hand is a character that you will always fight last. ==Gameplay== The point of the game is to beat the character(s) that you are fighting. To beat them you must hit them again until they are very hurt. Once they are very hurt, you have to knock them off of the stage in some way. ===One player mode=== In 1P mode, you have to fight all of the characters in the game (including the one you are using) and Master Hand. You also play some mini- games along the way. In this mode, you can unlock characters and stages by doing certain things. It does not work like that with Master Hand, though. With Master Hand, you have to hit him again and again until he dies. You do not have to knock him off the stage. It's impossible to knock him off the stage. ===Multiplayer mode=== In multiplayer mode, up to 4 people can play against each other non-stop. If there are fighters that have died at the same time, they will fight in a sudden death battle. In that battle, they are badly hurt and they have to fight other fighters who made it into the sudden death battle as well. ===Mini-games=== The two mini-games are \"Break The Targets\" and \"Board The Platforms\". In Break The Targets, you have to break 10 targets. It's very hard to get all 10 of the targets. The same goes for Board The Platforms except you have to just simply land on all of the platforms. Board The Platforms is a little bit harder than Break The Targets. Characters can be unlocked in these mini-games. ==Home Stages== Series Character Home stage Super Mario Bros.
