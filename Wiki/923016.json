 "text": "The lautenwerck is a keyboard instrument. It is also called the lute- harpsichord. Like the harpsichord, it makes sound by plucking the strings with a plectrum. It uses gut strings instead of metal strings. The gut strings make the instrument sound like a lute. There are no lautenwercks from the 18th century which survive today. Johann Sebastian Bach had two lute-harpsichords. It is thought that some of the music that he wrote for the lute is actually for the lautenwerck. == References == Category:Keyboard instruments Category:Early musical instruments",
