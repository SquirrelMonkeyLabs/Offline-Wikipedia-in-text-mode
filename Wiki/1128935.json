 "text": "Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti Sirivibulyarajakumar (; , ; born 29 April 2005) is a member of Thailandâ€™s Chakri dynasty and heir presumptive to the throne of Thailand. He is the fifth son and seventh and youngest child of King Vajiralongkorn. His mother is Srirasmi Suwadee, the king's third legal wife. After the Crown Prince divorced his second wife in 1996, he disowned their four sons, leaving Dipangkorn as the only son recognised by the king. Princess Bajrakitiyabha, the second likely heir in line to the throne and oldest daughter of the king, was widely thought to be the next person in line until falling into a coma in December 2022. Afterwards, Dipangkorn has been widely seen as the next-in-line. ==References== Category:2005 births Category:Living people Category:Princes and princesses Category:Thai royalty Category:People from Bangkok",
