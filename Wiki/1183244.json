 "text": "The Kingdom of Serbia (, , ) was a province (crownland) of the Habsburg monarchy. It existed from 1718 to 1739. The kingdom was formed out of a territory. This territory was south of the rivers Sava and Danube. The Habsburg monarchy took this land from the Ottoman Empire in 1717. The area returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1739. Even though the Kingdom was a province, they still had their own autonomy (they could rule on their own). They had their own militia and economy. However, the militia and economy were also connected to the Habsburg monarchy. This autonomy helped grow the middle class of the Kingdom of Serbia. The population of Serbia went from 270,000 to 400,000. Habsburg slowly lost power in this region, however. This caused the second Great Migrations of the Serbs (1737–1739). ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Other websites== * Karl A.
