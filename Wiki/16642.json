Rethinking disability: principles for professional and social change. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole. ISBN 978-0-534-54929-9 These conditions may be congenital (present at birth), cognitive (associated with the brain), developmental (appears as the person develops) and physical, which can be caused by an accident or infection. ==Introduction== The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines disability in Article 1 as: Invisible disabilities, or hidden disabilities, are disabilities that are not immediately obvious, such as intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mental disorders, asthma, epilepsy, allergies, migraines, arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. ==Difficulties== People with a disability or disabilities may need to use special equipment that can help them. This can include using a wheelchair, a cane or walking stick, hearing aids, a teletypewriter (TTY) and using specially designed software and hardware for the personal computer. Those on a wheelchair cannot walk up or down stairs in a building. They need to use ramps and elevators going into and moving around in a building. Wide doorways and accessible toilets also make it easier for people with physical disabilities to use. ==Discrimination== Hatred of the disabled is widespread, ranging from the far left * * * * * to far right, * * * * * which is called ableism.
