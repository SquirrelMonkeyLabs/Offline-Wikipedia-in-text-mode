 "text": "\"One Week\" is the first single off of Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies's fourth studio album Stunt. The song was released on September 15, 1998. The song was able to make it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, #1 on the Alternative Airplay, #1 on the Mainstream Top 40, #2 on the Adult Alternative Songs, and #2 on the Adult Top 40. Ironically, it stayed at #1 on the Hot 100 chart for one week. It was also certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The song is filled with pop culture references. In the song, it mentions the superhero Aquaman, the restaurant Swiss Chalet, the anime Sailor Moon, the television show The X-Files, the movies Frantic, Vertigo, and Seven Samurai, actor Harrison Ford, director Akira Kurosawa, musicians Busta Rhymes, LeAnn Rimes, Bert Kaempfert, and Sting, the song \"Scenario\" by A Tribe Called Quest, and the chocolate bar Snickers. Some people were wondering what the lyric \"I’m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral / Can’t understand what I mean? Well, you soon will\" meant. Vocalist Ed Robertson said that when he was at the funeral of his older brother who died in a motorcycle accident, the pastor was quoting \"Free Bird\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Drummer Tyler Stewart whispered \"SKYNARD!\" to him and held up the devil horns which caused Robertson to laugh. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1998 songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs Category:Rap rock songs Category:Pop rock songs Category:Barenaked Ladies songs",
