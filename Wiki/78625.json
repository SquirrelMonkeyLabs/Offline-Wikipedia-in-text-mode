 "text": "An endangered species is a group of animals or plants which is threatened by becoming extinct. This could happen because there are few of that animal left, its predators have grown in number, or the climate that it lives in is changing, or the places it lives in have been destroyed. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has worked out that endangered species are 40% of all organisms. ==How to get rid of endangered species== Many countries have laws to protect these plants and animals. These laws, if obeyed, can save species by stopping hunting, land development or making parks and reserves. Poaching and other illegal activities, however, can still destroy them. Only a few plants and animals at risk of extinction, mostly vertebrates, are put on the lists and get legal protection. Many more species become extinct, or will become extinct, without people knowing about it. ==Mammal== This is a list of some mammals that are endangered. They include: * Asiatic linsang * Asiatic lion * Black-footed ferret * Black rhinoceros * Blue whale * Dhole * Ethopian wolf * Hairy-eared dwarf lemur * Indonesian mountain weasel * Snow leopard * Tiger * White rhinoceros (currently considered as near endangered) ==Birds== Endangered birds include: * Albatross * Crowned solitary eagle * Grey parrot ==Related pages== * CITES * IUCN Red List * Protected area ==Further reading== *Endangered or Not, but at Least No Longer Waiting March 6, 2013 New York Times == References ==",
