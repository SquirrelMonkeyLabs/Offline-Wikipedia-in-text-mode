It is located south of Tupungato, one of the highest mountains in the Americas, and about southeast of Santiago. ==History== The first ascent of this peak was made on 19 January 1833 by Paul Güssfeldt, a German geologist, mountaineer and explorer, together with two Chilean guides: Lorenzo Zamorano and Francisco (only the first name is known). ==Geography== In Chile, the Maipo volcano is in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, Cordillera province, San José de Maipo commune.
