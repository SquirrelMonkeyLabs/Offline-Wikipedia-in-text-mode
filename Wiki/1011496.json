 "text": "Stabiae was a Ancient Roman settlement, about southwest of Pompeii. Like Pompeii, this seaside resort was largely buried by tephra ash in the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in this case at a smaller depth of up to five metres.Giovanna Bonifacio; Anna Maria Sodo, Gina Carla Ascione, In Stabiano - Cultura e archeologia da Stabiae , Castellammare di Stabia, Longobardi Editore, 2006. p. 117-118 It is only from Mount Vesuvius. Stabiae is most famous for the Roman villas found near the ancient. They are some of the most stunning architectural and artistic remains from any Roman villas.Stabiae: Master Plan 2006, the Archaeological Superintendancy of Pompeii, School of Architecture of the University of Maryland, The Committee of Stabiae Reborn They are the largest concentration of well-preserved, enormous, elite seaside villas found from the entire Roman world. The villas were on a 50 m high headland overlooking the Gulf of Naples.San Diego Museum of Art exhibition on Stabiae Although it was discovered before Pompeii in 1749, unlike Pompeii and Herculaneum, Stabiae was reburied by 1782 and so failed to establish itself as a destination for travellers on the Grand Tour. Many of the objects and frescoes taken from these villas are now in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. There had already been a settlement there, before the Romans. The port of Stabiae already existed in the 6th century BC, but was much smaller than that of Pompeii. In 89 BC, Sulla descroyed much of Stabiae.Pliny the Elder rep√ºorted that the city was rebuilt soon afterwards. According to him, it was a popular destination for wealthy Romans. == References == Category:Cities affected by the eruption of mount Vesuvius in 79 AD",
