It can be done in Madison, Milwaukee, and Sheboygan during the first 22 weeks of pregnancy.State bans on abortion throughout pregnancy, Guttmacher Institute, 29 August 2023. However, there is still some disagreement about abortion in Wisconsin after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022. Some people who are against abortion point to an old law from 1849. They say this law bans abortion unless the mother's life is in danger. However, some courts have said that this law only applies to killing a baby after birth, not abortion and courts are still deciding if this law can be enforced. In a 2014 poll, 53% of people in Wisconsin said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 45% said it should be illegal in most or all cases.
