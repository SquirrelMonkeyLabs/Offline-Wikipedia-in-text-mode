 "text": "On 24 May 1983, Diana Gould and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher talked on TV. On BBC, Gould asked Tatcher about the sinking of the Belgrano. The Belgrano was an Argentine warship during the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and ArgentinaJulia Langdon (25 May 1983). \"Sinking of Belgrano surfaces again\", The Guardian, p. 2: \"Mrs Thatcher insisted that the orders to sink the Belgrano were justified because it was a danger to British ships.\" \"A moment of weakness, fathoms deep\", The Guardian (editorial), 26 May 1983, p. 12: \"Why, inquired Mrs. Gould, had the Tory War cabinet ordered the sinking of the Belgrano ...?\" In 1999, it was voted as one of the most memorable(or easy to remember) things in British television.Russell Galbraith (2000). Inside Outside: A Biography of Tam Dalyell: The Man They Can't Gag. Edinburgh: Mainstream, 187. The discussion between Thatcher and Gould became iconic. Gould asked many times to why Thatcher did what she did during the sinking.Clive Bloom (2015). Thatcher's Secret War: Subversion, Coercion, Secrecy and Government, 1974–90. Stroud: The History Press, 82–84. Thatcher was angry that the BBC had allowed the question to be asked. Denis Thatcher, her husband, told the producer that the BBC was poorly produced. ==References== ==Further reading== * Gould, Diana (15 November 1984). \"After the war\", London Review of Books, 6(21), review of Another Story: Women and the Falklands War by Jean Carr.
