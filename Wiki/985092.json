 "text": "Johntá Austin (born June 28, 1980) is a American singer-songwriter who won two Grammy Awards on Jermaine Dupri's So So Def Recordings. ==History== Austin grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1989, at the age of eight, Austin hosted the daily television show, Kid's Beat on CNN. Covering current events, sports and the world of entertainment, Austin went on to become the Atlanta Bureau Chief for the CNN weekly news program, Real News for Kids and the reporter for the TBS half hour weekly, Feed Your Mind. Austin grew up singing in church choirs and wanted to become an actor, interviewing celebrities like Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan, among others. In 1993, he made his television debut on The Arsenio Hall Show, where he admitted he loved to sing and was offered to sing with Arsenio Hall's band. He was originally signed in the mid-late '90s to RCA Records before being succeeded by R&B; singer Tyrese Gibson. However, he ended up writing a few songs for him (including the hit \"Sweet Lady\") as well as writing for other artists. Austin has been extremely busy and successful during the past several years. He co-wrote Mariah Carey's hit 2005 singles, \"We Belong Together\", \"Don't Forget About Us\", \"It's Like That\", and \"Shake It Off\" from her album The Emancipation of Mimi. Austin also co-wrote Mary J. Blige's single \"Be Without You\" from her #1 selling CD \"The Breakthrough\" and Monica's single \"Everytime Tha Beat Drop\" from her album The Makings of Me. He also appears as a guest artist on Jermaine Dupri's 2005 song \"Gotta Getcha\" and has co-written a few songs on Chris Brown's self-titled debut album in 2005, as well as Marques Houston's \"Can I Call You\" from her debut album in 2003. Austin produced and was featured on the songs \"Shortie Like Mine\" and \"Outta My System,\" both singles by rapper Bow Wow from his album The Price of Fame. Both songs were successful, \"Shortie Like Mine\" peaking at number 9, and \"Outta My System\" peaking at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. The release of his debut album, Love, Sex & Religion, has been repeatedly delayed, due in part to So So Def changing its affiliation from Virgin Music to Island Records. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1980 births Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American Grammy Award winners Category:Singers from Atlanta",
