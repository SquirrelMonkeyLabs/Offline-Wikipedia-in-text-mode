 "text": "Charlottesville is a city in Virginia in the United States. It is named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, King George III's queen. As of 2020, 46,553 people lived there. In 2004, Charlottesville was named the best place to live in the United States in a book named Cities Ranked and Rated. Three American presidents have lived in Charlottesville, including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. The University of Virginia is in Charlottesville. President Jefferson's home, Monticello, is also in Charlottesville. Both are popular places for people to visit. In 2017, far-right political groups including the Ku Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis, and Proud Boys held their Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. They did not want the city to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee. One man drove his car into a crowd of counter- protesters, killing a woman called Heather Heyer and injuring many others. United States President Donald Trump would later say there were \"fine people\" on both sides of the incident. ==References== Category:Cities in Virginia Category:County seats in Virginia",
