 "text": "Homefront is a first-person shooter video game made by Kaos Studios for Windows and the Xbox 360 and Digital Extremes for the PC. The game is set in the future America in the year 2027 and is about the nuclear-armed Korean People's Army (of North Korea) who invade the USA. The game's main character can either fight the North Koreans in the main game or the Americans in the multiplayer game. There has been controversy over the game's release in Japan where they censored the game by removing all the references to North Korea which included pictures of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il because they thought that to \"use their real names would have been 'malicious' {evil} to an 'existing person' and an 'existing country.'\". The game has also been banned from all types of sales in South Korea. ==References== ==Other websites== *Homefront's Official website Category:2011 video games Category:THQ games Category:First-person shooters Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Science fiction shooter video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games",
