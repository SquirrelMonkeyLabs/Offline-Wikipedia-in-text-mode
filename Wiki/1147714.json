 "text": "A military reserve is a group of trained people who are not currently serving in the military but can be asked or forced to join the military if needed. These people usually have previous military training and experience. They are still part of the country's defense system and are ready to support the military during emergencies, such as wars, natural disasters, or other crises. Military reserves let a country quickly increase its miltary strength without needing to keep a large, expensive army. People in military reserves train regularly to stay skilled and often have civilian jobs, but are ready to join the military if needed. Category:Military",
