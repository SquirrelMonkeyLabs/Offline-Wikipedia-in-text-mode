Each card contains a list of numerical data and the aim of the game is to compare these values to try to trump and win an opponent's card. A wide variety of different packs of Top Trumps has been published. The goal of Top Trumps is to win the most rounds by having the highest-scoring card in each round. One person begins by reading out a category such as Intelligence or Funniest and each players cards have a number rating of 1-100 on each category - Then the person with the highest number rating in top trumps wins. A pack of cards is based on a theme, such as cars, aircraft, books, boats, dinosaurs or characters from a popular film or television series. The rarest is the Grandmamma card which no known Top Trumper has got and may not even exist. The game is suitable for around 4 years upward. Category:Card games",
