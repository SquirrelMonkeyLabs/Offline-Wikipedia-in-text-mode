 "text": "Repetitive strain injury (RSI), also known as occupational overuse syndrome, is a medical condition. It causes pain in the muscles, nerves, or tendons after a person uses the same part of the body over and over again, or without taking breaks. It is usually caused by doing the same thing repeatedly or without breaks. Using a computer or mobile for long periods of time is a common cause of this problem. Repetitive strain injury is described as a sudden, intense pain in affected parts of the body, often the wrists, neck, back or hands, that keeps coming back. It is different from more specific diagnoses, because there are many possible causes for RSI. The pain is often spread across different muscle groups and inspection of the affected area usually cannot show any differences from that of a healthy person. Because of this, treatment for RSI is usually limited to rest and exercises, and sometimes wearing a brace. ==References== Category:Disability",
