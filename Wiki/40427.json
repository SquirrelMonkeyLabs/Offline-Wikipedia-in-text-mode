 "text": "San Francisco Municipal Railway (or MUNI) is the public transit agency that runs buses, cable car, and subway service in the city of San Francisco, California. MUNI runs diesel and trolleybuses that run throughout San Francisco, three Cable Car lines that run through the Financial District and Chinatown (with service to Fisherman's Wharf) and the Market Street surface, seven light rail lines that run below Market Street and two Historic Streetcar lines. Muni operates 365 days a year and connects with other transportation services, such as Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Caltrain commuter trains, along with AC Transit, Golden Gate Transit and SamTrans buses and ferries from Golden Gate Ferries and San Francisco Bay Ferry. ==Services== ===Bus=== Muni operates forty-four local bus routes; two are operated during weekday peak hours. A number of routes have different terminals during evenings and/or weekends. Some routes also operate short turn route services during peak hours to deal with crowding on buses. Rapid lines have an R following their route number. Muni operates five Rapid bus routes. The Rapid routes largely follow the route of the local buses but have fewer stops on the corridor. Express lines have an X, AX, or BX following their route number. Muni operates twelve express bus routes. Most of the express routes run on highways and on one-way traffic. These express routes also operate during peak hours. Muni operates fourteen owl routes. Owl routes are operated at midnight. Some local daytime routes are shortened during owl service. And some owl routes also cover big or small parts of daytime bus routes. ===Muni Metro=== Muni operates seven light rail lines and has its own subway tunnel underneath Market Street. Each of these routes is named with a letter instead of a number. ====Heritage streetcars==== Muni operates two historic streetcar lines, these routes are operated by streetcars and are mostly treated as tourist attractions by tourists. ===Cable Cars=== Muni operates three cable car lines, these routes are based out of the cable car barn at Mason and Washington streets. ==Gallery== Muni 7201 on first day of service, August 2015.jpg|A trolleybus on the 14 Mission line. 6408-SFOCableCarTurntable.jpg|A cable car being turned around at the end of the line, August 1964. ==References== ==Other websites== *NextBus for Muni, a GPS system that predicts vehicle arrival times. *Market Street Railway Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:1912 establishments in California",
