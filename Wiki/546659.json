 "text": "Monte Vettore (; \"victorious\") is a mountain on the border between Umbria and the Marche, in Central Italy. It is the highest mountain in the Marche region and in the province of Ascoli Piceno. ==Geography== The mountain is part of the Sibillini Mountains (), a mountain group in Italy, part of the central Apennines between eastern Umbria and the Marche. It is in the \"Sibillini Mountains National Park\" (). Below the peak, in a small enclosed U-shaped valley is one lake called the Lago di Pilato, at an altitude of . Even if it is a small lake ( in diameter), it is important for biologists; a fresh water shrimp, Chirocephalus marchesonii, is endemic to this lake. Today climbers reach it from the Umbrian side from Norcia, a town and comune in the province of Perugia (Italy) in southeastern Umbria or, on the Marche side, from Ascoli Piceno. ==Related pages== *List of Italian regions by highest point ==References== ==Other websites== * *Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibilini Category:Mountains of Italy Category:Marche",
