 "text": "A personal stylist advises individuals on new fashion trends, clothing styles, personal styles, colours and make-up. A personal stylist is not to be confused with a wardrobe stylist, who selects the clothing for published editorial features, print or Television advertising campaigns, music videos, concert performances, and public appearances made by celebrities and models. Personal stylists typically work one-on-one with the client, while Wardrobe Stylists are often part of a larger creative team collaborating with a fashion designer, Photographer, art director, hair stylist, and Makeup artist to put together a particular look or theme for the specific project. == Related pages == * Chanel, French Fashion house * Yves Saint Laurent, French Fashion house == References == Category:Fashion designers Category:Fashion houses",
