 "text": "The Khedivate of Egypt (Arabic: الْخُدَيْوِيَّةُ الْمِصْرِيَّةُ, Ottoman Turkish: خدیویت مصر) was an tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, created and ruled by the Muhammad Ali family. The United Kingdom invaded Egypt and took control of it in 1882, basically making it a British puppet, but the Ottoman connection was kept. In 1914, the Ottoman Empire's link to Egypt was ended and Britain established a protectorate called the Sultanate of Egypt. == References == Category:History of Egypt Category:Former protectorates Category:Ottoman Empire Category:1867 establishments Category:19th-century establishments in Egypt Category:20th-century disestablishments in Africa Category:1914 disestablishments",
