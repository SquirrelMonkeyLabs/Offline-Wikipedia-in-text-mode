 "text": "Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It also covers the same area as Kings County. Brooklyn is New York City's second largest borough in land area (after Queens). As of 2020, about 2.7 million people live there. This is more than in any of the other four boroughs. Brooklyn is the west end of Long Island. The East River separates it from Manhattan in the north. Brooklyn's only land boundary is with Queens in the east. Jamaica Bay separates Brooklyn from Rockaway in the south. The Narrows separates Brooklyn from Staten Island in the west. Coney Island is at the south end of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Museum is near the middle of Brooklyn, near Prospect Park. == History == Brooklyn is named after a Dutch town called \"Breukelen\". Dutch people were the first people from Europe to live in the area. When they got there, there were already some Native American people living there called the Lenape. The Dutch started the town in 1634 as part of the colony of New Netherland. During the 19th century Brooklyn expanded and filled Kings County. It remained a separate city before the people there voted to join New York City in 1898. Today, many parts of Brooklyn are home to people who are mostly from one culture or ethnicity. Other parts are mixed. The Brooklyn Bridge is old and famous. It goes over the East River and connects Downtown Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. The longest bridge in New York, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Bay Ridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island. ==References== Category:County seats in New York (state) Category:1634 establishments in North America Category:1630s establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:17th-century establishments in New York",
