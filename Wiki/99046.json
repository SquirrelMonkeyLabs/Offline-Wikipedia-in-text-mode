Medha, the protagonist of Sarojini’s novel, was a bohemian. In her pre-marital stage, she was thinking that it was boring to live with a man life-long. In her novel Pratibandi, Sarojini has also described the development of sexuality in a woman. Priyanka, the protagonist of the novel has to encounter the loneliness in the exile of Saragpali, a remote village of India. This loneliness develops into a sexual urge and soon Priyanka finds herself sexually attached with a former Member of Parliament. Though there is an age gap between them, his intelligence impresses her and she discovers a hidden archaeologist in him. Sarojini has painted successfully the difference of sensibility towards sexuality among male and female. Sarojini has her own credibility for the frankness to deals with the sensitive matters either it may be in politics or in sexuality. She has gained a reputation and has her own place in the history of Oriya fiction. Her novel Gambhiri Ghara describes an unusual relationship between two people, a Hindu house wife of India and a Muslim artist of Pakistan. It is a net oriented novel. A woman meets a very sexually experienced man. One day he asks if she had any such experience. The woman, Kuki, scolds him and insults him by calling him a caterpillar. She said without love lust is like hunger of a caterpillar. Gradually they become involved with love, lust and spiritually. That man considers her as his daughter, lover, mother, and above all these as a Goddess. They both madly love each other, through the internet and on the phone. They use obscene language; they kiss each other online. Kuki does not lead a happy conjugal life though she has a love marriage with Aniket. The novel is not limited to only a love story. It has a greater aspect. It deals with the relationship between the State and individual. Safique, who is not a Muslim by temperament, and as a historian, thinks the Pakistan of today has separated itself from its roots and looks towards Arabian legends for his history. He protests that the syllabus of history for the school should start from seventh century AD, not from the Mahenjodaro and Harappa. This broad Safique was once arrested after the bomb blast of London for allegation of being associated with the terrorist. But is it a true fact? Later Kuki came to know that Safiques is trapped by a military junta. The ex-lover of Tabassum had revenge on Safique by arresting him with an allegation of terrorism. Her novel Gambhiri Ghara proved to be a bestseller in Oriya literature. Her novels have a reputation for their feminist outlook and sexual frankness and has been translated into English and published from India under the title, The Dark Abode (2008) () and published from Bangladesh in Bengali as Mithya Gerosthali. (2007) () Dr. Vishwanath Bite is working on its Marathi translation. Another novel Pakhibas has been translated in to Bengali and published from Bangladesh under the same title () in 2009. ==References== ==Other websites== * Sarojini Sahoo - official web site * Sarojini Sahoo - Blog * Interview with Sarojini at ' The New York Times' owned Portal * Interview with Sarojini at French Portal Category:Indian writers Category:1956 births Category:Living people",
