 "text": "South Wales () is the region of Wales located near England and the Bristol Channel to the east and south, and Mid Wales and West Wales to the north and west. The most densely populated region in the southwest of the United Kingdom. It has a population of about 2.2 million people.. The Brecon Beacons national park covers about a third of South Wales. The park also contains Pen y Fan, the highest mountain south of Snowdonia. The region's boundary is not specifically known. It is considered that Glamorgan, Monmouthshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire are a part of it. By the west, from Swansea westwards, local people would probably say that they lived in both South Wales and West Wales because of the overlap in the artificial boundaries. == References == Category:Regions of Wales",
