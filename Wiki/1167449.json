 "text": "Secondary antisemitism is a special form of antisemitism that emerged after the Holocaust ended. ==Origin== Peter Schönbach ‒ a Frankfurt School co-worker of the German Jewish philosophers Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno ‒ came up with the concept based on the critical theory (CT). ===Early research=== They drew their inspiration from a qualitative analysis of group interviews in the late 1940s, * Theodor W. Adorno, « Schuld und Abwehr. Eine qualitative Analyse zum Gruppenexperiment » (1955), in Theodor W. Adorno, Soziologische Schriften II.2, Frankfurt/M., Suhrkamp, 2017, p. 121-324. * (1909 Vienna - 1981 Rehovot) (צבי רקס). As Zvi Rix he published an essay \"The Great Terror\" in the first issue (April 1975) of Immanuel Velikovsky's Kronos: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Synthesis. Cf. Rix-Velikovsky Correspondence April 1962 – Jan 1977 at varchive.org. Gunnar Heinsohn mentions Zvi Rix in his books Was ist Antisemitismus (1988) and Söhne und Weltmacht (2003). * * where they observed that the interviewed Germans still hated Jews, denied their guilt for the Nazi war crimes and saw themselves as the \"double victims\" of Nazi and Soviet terror. The interviewed Germans held Jews accountable for their hardship under Allied occupation due to the false belief that Jews (1) \"applied illegitimate pressure on the Allies\" to punish Germany (2) \"controlled the black market\". ==Concept== Henryk M. Broder (1946 – ) discussed a commonly quoted description of the concept in his 1986 book (\"The Eternal Antisemite\"), which is reportedly made by the Israeli psychiatrist : Horkheimer and Adorno spoke of \"guilt-defensive anti-Semitism\" motivated by a deflection of guilt. As per Adorno, some Germans never admitted their role in the Holocaust. Instead, the Germans projected it onto the Jews by blaming them for their own genocide. They further hypothesized that secondary antisemitism came from \"latent\" guilt and \"blind\" identification with their nation, which is classifiable by a mix of individual \"guilt complex\", sociological \"group defense reflex\" and nationalism. The three elements altogether made them deny the Holocaust. ==Situation== Since the end of the Holocaust, Holocaust distortion Distortion of the Holocaust refers, inter alia, to: * * * * * * associated with secondary antisemitism has increased in a number of Eastern European countries, including Romania and Poland. * * * * * * * * * * * ===Romania=== ====Communist age (1947 – 1989)==== Under Nicolae Ceaușescu's communist rule, Romania's role in the Holocaust, including the Iași pogrom and Odessa massacre, * International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania.

Romanians were taught about the \"heroic anti-fascist resistance\", emphasizing the anti-Nazi battles following Romania's defection to the Allies. Many former subordinates of Ion Antonescu served in the secret police of Nicolae Ceaușescu and to help him oppress Romanians. Meanwhile, Nicolae Ceaușescu reportedly believed lies about Jews, including The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and defined Jew as a \"money-changer\" and an \"extortionist\" in an official English–Romanian dictionary. ====Post-communist age (1989 – )==== Since the fall of Ceaușescu's communist regime, a systematic effort to whitewash the war criminals, especially Ion Antonescu, has been observed by scholars. Antonescu is praised by some so-called historians as a hero who waged a \"holy war against Bolshevism\". Acts of Holocaust denial by politicians occurred from time to time, notable of whom include Ion Iliescu, the former President of Romania (2000 – 2004). He made similar claims to those of Ceaușescu that there was \"no Holocaust within Romania\" and that the Poles, Jews and communists \"were treated equally\", while denying the Romanian role in the Holocaust and the verified Romanian Jewish death toll. An international inquiry, led by Romanian-American Jewish writer Elie Wiesel, identified all the evidence of Romania's role in the Holocaust. The Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania (Romanian: Institutul Național pentru Studierea Holocaustului din România „Elie Wiesel”, INSHR), a state-funded Holocaust research center, was also founded in 2005. In November 2021, the Romanian parliament passed a law, by a large majority, to require the teaching of the Holocaust and Jewish history from 2023. The only group opposing it was the nationalist party Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR). The AUR was condemned by the INSHR. Since September 2023, the Holocaust and Jewish history have become part of the high school curriculum in Romania. ===Poland=== In the 2010s, Poland passed laws that have been seen as suppressing academic discussions about WWII Polish collaboration with Nazi occupiers, while violence towards relevant researchers * * * * * and the Polish Jewish community have reportedly increased. * * * * * Writing for The Times of Israel, Jewish historian Dr. Alexandria Fanjoy Silver believed that the normalization of Holocaust distortion and violence towards the said groups in Poland was caused by secondary antisemitism. ==Academic views== ===Werner Bergmann=== In 2007, German sociologist Werner Bergmann wrote an article about the \"semantics\" (study of meaning) of secondary antisemitism,Werner Bergmann, « ‘Störenfriede der Erinnerung’ », art. cit. where he summarized the features as follows: * Holocaust denial or relativization IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. * Aufrechnung (\"count\"): ** False accusation of Jews having been \"equally responsible\" for their own genocide, commonly seen in anti-Zionist propaganda * * * * * * * * * * popular in the Middle East * * * * * * ** Exaggeration of WWII German suffering to create a false equivalence to Jewish suffering * Request for Germans to \"move on from the past\" and re-embrace their history * False accusations of the Holocaust being \"abused\" to serve the interest of Israel, commonly made by Holocaust deniers to influence uninformed readers into denying the Holocaust * * * * * ===Alexandria Fanjoy Silver=== Dr. Alexandria Fanjoy Silver, sharing similar concerns to Prof. Jan Grabowski, postulated that secondary antisemitism was \"rooted in the psychological process of guilt-deflection\", involving a \"negation of personal responsibility\". Dr. Silver added that Holocaust inversion, * * * * * * and the gaslighting of Jews who faced antisemitic abuses, showed secondary antisemitism to be a systemic issue in Western society, making it hard for Jews to discuss their lived experiences. For instance, many Jews faced allegations of \"talking too much about the Holocaust\", being \"anti-Palestinian\" or \"ignoring Islamophobia\" for raising awareness about Hamas' atrocities on October 7, 2023, despite Jews having suffered 68% of religion-based hate crimes in the United States (US) in 2023 as per FBI data, * * * * * while 46% of the world's adult population (around 2,200,000,000 people) were found to hold deeply entrenched antisemitic views as of January 2025. * * * * Dr. Silver considered those accusing Jews of being \"genocidal\" as being motivated by secondary antisemitism given that the accusers were \"so uncomfortable in its immorality\" that they had to \"twist it into an expression of morality.\" She also highlighted that secondary antisemitism was statistically the highest in Europe as of 2022 in relation to Holocaust memory, education and commemoration. * * * ===Clemens Heni=== Political scientist Dr. Clemens Heni maintained that secondary antisemitism often involved Holocaust inversion, in whose relevant propaganda tends to single out Israeli Jews for perceived wrongdoings. Dr. Heni found that those propaganda usually exaggerated Germans' suffering from Allied bombing operations (e.g. the Dresden bombing in February 1945) and false accusing Israeli Jews of \"weaponizing\" the Holocaust to \"extort\" from present Germans, which he classified as \"soft-core Holocaust denial\" – a synonym for Holocaust distortion. Those who distributed such propaganda include German author Jörg Friedrich, Martin Walser and sociologist Wolfgang Sofsky, whose ideas contributed to a false claim made by far-right National Democratic Party's parliamentarians at a Saxon State Parliament (Landtag) session that \"the British committed a bombing Holocaust against the Germans in Dresden\". The post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe was also phrased by the \"soft-core\" deniers as an expulsion Holocaust, some of whom are academic leftists, such as Ward Churchill, Robert Kurz, Noam Chomsky and John Mearsheimer. Such academic leftists are said to have a history of accusing Jews of \"controlling\" America's government to support Israel – with tropes like \"US-Jewish leaders\" and \"Israel lobby\" – and \"American capitalism\" of having \"caused the Holocaust\" based on the unfounded claim that the Auschwitz was \"the utmost consequence of Fordism\". ==Related pages== * Historical revisionism * Holocaust uniqueness debate ==References== Category:Racism Category:Germany Category:Society Category:Sociology Category:Antisemitism Category:Discrimination Category:Jewish history Category:History of Europe Category:20th century in Europe Category:21st century in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Europe Category:Antisemitism in Germany",
