 "text": "'Experience points, commonly known as ‘xp’ or 'exp', are numbers used in certain role-playing games. Gaining enough experience points usually leads to the player \"leveling up.\" Each \"level up\" means that the player is more powerful than before. They can use better weapons, armor, and magic. Most games have a maximum level that the player can achieve, which means they can not get any more experience points. == References == Category:Role-playing games",
