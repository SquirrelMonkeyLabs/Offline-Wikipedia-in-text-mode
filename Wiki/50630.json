His career lasted more than 60 years. He served as Liberal Prime Minister four times. This was more than any other person (1868-1874, 1880-1885, 1886 and 1892-1894). Gladstone was 84 years old when he resigned for the last time. This made him Britain's oldest ever Prime Minister. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer four times (1853-1855, 1859-1866, 1873-1874 and 1880-1882). Gladstone was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * * * * Category:1809 births Category:1898 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer Category:English Anglicans Category:English theologians Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for English constituencies Category:Leaders of the Liberal Party (UK) Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs Category:People buried in Westminster Abbey Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Politicians from Liverpool Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Secretaries of State of the United Kingdom Category:UK MPs 1832–1835 Category:UK MPs 1835–1837 Category:UK MPs 1837–1841 Category:UK MPs 1841–1847 Category:UK MPs 1847–1852 Category:UK MPs 1852–1857 Category:UK MPs 1857–1859 Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:UK MPs 1865–1868 Category:UK MPs 1868–1874 Category:UK MPs 1874–1880 Category:UK MPs 1880–1885 Category:UK MPs 1885–1886 Category:UK MPs 1886–1892 Category:UK MPs 1892–1895",
