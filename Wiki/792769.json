 "text": "Bhutanese animation is animation from Bhutan. It is mostly used to make people aware of relevant social issues, economical issues and political issues or to promote Bhutanese culture. Bhutanese animators and clients believe using animation for public awareness is more effective than brochures and pamphlets. For example, Ap Naka was made to tell people about earthquakes. The Bhutanese animation industry is quite new. Pema Tshering D made the first Bhutanese 3D-animated film, which came out in 2001. His first animation was of a beetle dancing, and his first public awareness animation is Oye Penjor, which is about AIDS. It took about three months to make, was the first Bhutanese 3D animation, and was made with Druk Vision Studio, which he owns. In 2005, KLK anImagine and Druk Vision Studio, which are major animation studios in Bhutan, were started. KLK anImagine is owned by Kinga Sithup. The first Bhutanese 2D animation is an awareness campaign about rubella that was made by KLK anImagine. It is common for Bhutanese animators to split 10 frames into 25 frames or to animate in 24 frames per second. By 2008, Druk Vision Studio had made about 7 animated films, and KLK anImagine had made about 20 animated films. The first Bhutanese full-length 3D-animated film is Ap Bokto, which first came out in September 2014. Ap Bokto was made by Athang Animation Studio, which was started in 2010. ==References== ==Other websites== * Oye Penjor * Ap Naka Category:Animation Category:Bhutanese culture",
