 "text": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space probe by the European Space Agency == More Information == The LISA mission is made to find gravitational waves, tiny waves in the fabric of spacetime from astronomical sources like binary black holes coilliding and a compact binary of stars, and possibly other sources. The LISA concept has three spacecraft that are in a triangle with each side being 2.5 milion kilometrers long. == The Mission == The LISA mission's main objective is to find and study gravitational waves that are made by black holes and others. Each of the three LISA spacecraft has two telescopes, two lasers and two test equipment. The larger the triangle, the more sensitive the detector is to long gravitational waves. == LISA Pathfinder == A European Space Agency test mission that is called LISA Pathfinder was launched in 2015 to test the things needed for LISA to work. == Related pages == * Big Bang Observer - proposed LISA successor * Beyond Einstein program - a project by NASA to test the limits of the General Theory of Relativity == Refrences ==",
