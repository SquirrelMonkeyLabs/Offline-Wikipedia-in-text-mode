Alan Turing thought that if a human could not tell the difference between another human and the computer, then the computer had shown intelligent behavior.Harnad, Stevan 2008.

In: Epstein, Robert & Peters, Grace (eds) Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer. Springer. == Test setup == A person has a telegraph, and is connected to two communication partners. One of the two correspondents is a machine. The person can ask anything with the telegraph. If the person cannot tell which of the two is the machine more than 50% of the time, then the machine is said to be intelligent. Later on, people narrowed down the test. A human is unlikely to know everything. Therefore, both the human and the machine would be specialists in some field of knowledge (and so would the person asking). == Media == The comic strip Dilbert makes several mentions to the PHB (Pointy Haired Boss) failing the Turing test. == Related pages == *AlphaGo == References == ==Other websites== * Category:Artificial intelligence",
