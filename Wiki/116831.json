 "text": "Pocoyo is a children's television series that aired for 4 series since 2005. Pocoyo does not talk very much. He has a few friends - including a bird named Baby Bird, an elephant named Elly, an octopus named Fred, a dog named Loula, a duck named Pato and a girl named Nina who also does not talk very much, but also speaks her own launguage. ==Characters== * Pocoyo is the main character of the series. He is a young boy full of curiosity who loves to play games and discover new things. He always wears a blue three-flap hat, a blue jacket with a yellow zipper, and a pair of blue pants and shoes. He is 4 years old; his \"birthday\" is October 14. His best friends are Baby Bird, Elly, Fred, Loula and Pato. He has a vehicle called the Vamoosh which he can use to travel under the water, in the air or through space. He is voiced by Montana Smedley in series 2, but occasionally, by Alex Marty in series 1. * The Narrator speaks over the entire show and often communicates directly with the characters. Pocoyo has a good relationship with him. He is always really delighted to see and hear him. The Narrator is also at times physically involved in the events of the episodes, making him like a heard-but-not-seen character rather than a strict narrator. * Baby Bird is a really small, and loud baby bird. He is the son of his mother Sleepy Bird, who gets into tricky situations from which he is rescued by Pocoyo. Named \"Pajarito\" in Spanish version (little bird). * Elly is a pink elephant who wears a blue backpack. She loves making biscuits and tea. She has a doll that she loves very much. Despite her size, she is graceful and gentle, capable of ballet dancing. She usually rides around on her pink scooter. * Fred the Octopus is a red octopus (shown with only 4 legs instead of 8, as to make animation rendering simpler) who speaks gibberish like Caterpillar. He is also fond of singing. He is in random episodes, sometimes as a main character, sometimes in passing. As of Season 2, he is sometimes referred to as just simply \"Fred\". He sounds similar to Pee-wee Herman. * Loula is Pocoyo's orange-yellow pet puppy and companion. Originally, the character's name was Lucas, in tribute to Creator and Director Guillermo García Carsi's dog, but for the series was lacking female characters so it was changed to Loula. * Pato is a yellow duck who wears nothing but a small green hat. Pato means duck in Spanish, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Papiamento. He is considered a favorite amongst the young children due to his dancing. Although, Pato is the most fussy and impatient character (indicated by his beak that bends in an angle when disappointed or shocked); on occasion he completely loses his temper, jumping up and down and quacking furiously. He is used as a jackhammer, missile or a hat. He can always become a helicopter when necessary. * The Children are a group of kids who, like The Narrator, speak over the show, answering questions asked by The Narrator in order to assist Pocoyo in solving a problem or to let Pocoyo in on what is going on. * Nina is another human character who is introduced in the 4th Season episode of the same name. She is a young girl similar to Pocoyo (likely younger than him) who has red hair, wears a lime green hoodie with two antennas, lime green shorts, and lime green shoes. Like Pato, She greatly loves plants and nature. She naturally speaks mostly a form of gibberish with Japanese or Spanish accent, but can also speak fluent English, though not as much as Pocoyo. She appears to be very fond of Pocoyo, always playing together like siblings. One image shows Nina kissing Pocoyo's cheeks, implying that they have a relationship. Her name resembles \"niña\", Spanish for \"girl\". Thanks to her robotic pet called Roberto (pronounced Roh-bear-toe), it has the ability to shrink where anyone can be shrunk as well. She replaces Loula's bit in the title sequence (except in her debut appearance and the episodes where she is absent). She is voiced by Noela Rodriguez. ==Episodes== ===Season 1=== # Umbrella, Umbrella # Drum Roll Please # Swept Away # Who's On the Phone? # Fetch Loula Fetch! # A Little Cloud # A Present For Elly # Pocoyo Dance # The Big Sneeze # A Mystery Most Puzzling # Hush # Double Bubble # The Key To It All # Keep Going, Pocoyo! # Sleepy Bird's Surprise # Where's Pocoyo? # Drummer Boy # The Great Race # Don't Touch! # Mystery Footprints # Magical Watering Can # Table for Fun # Twinkle Twinkle # Hiccup # Pato's Postal Service # Puppy Love # Bat and Ball # Elly Spots # Up Up and Away # A Surprise for Pocoyo # Having a Ball # Super Pocoyo # Let's Go Camping! # Pocoyo, Pocoyo # Elly's Big Chase # Pocoyo Gets It Right # Juggling Balls # Fussy Duck # A Dog's Life # Pocoyolympics # Picture This # Whale's Birthday === Similar Videos === # Pocoyo's Little Friend # Color My World # Bedtime # A Little Something Between Friends # Giggle Bug # What's in the Box? # Musical Blocks # Paint Me a Picture! # Elly's Doll # Wackily Ever After # Stay at Home ===Season 2=== # Mr Big Duck # Guess What? # All for One # Band of Friends # Upside Down # Mad Mix Machine # The Messy Guest # New on the Planet # Pocoyo's Present # Elly's Ballet Class # Pocoyo's Balloon # Who's' calling Me Now? # Big Scary Slide # Elly's shoes # Duck Stuck # Scary Noises # Not in my backyard # Vamoosh on the loosh # Detective Pocoyo # Scooter Madness # Lost in Space # Boo! # Party Pooper # My Pato # Baby Bird Bother # Dirty Dog # The Seed # Runaway Hat # Invisible Pocoyo # Noise to my Ears # Baby Bird Sitting # Everyone's Present # Magic Act # Picnic Puzzle # Pocoyo's Puppet Show # Pato's Egg # Dance Off! # Get Lost Loula # Sneaky Shoes # Shutterbug # Angry Alien # Pato Underwater # Pato's Paintings # Monster Mystery === Similar Videos === # Poczilla # Elly on Ice # Farewell Friends # Double Trouble # Horse! # Elly's Tea Party # Talent Show # Remember when... ===Season 3: Let's Go Pocoyo=== # Pocoyo's Band # Picnic # Pato's Shower # The Garden # Pato the Postman # Colours # Ready, Steady, Go # Camping # Space mission # Travel with Pato # Playtime # Tennis Everyone # Hide and Seek # Party Time # Wheels # Elly's Bath # The Amazing Tower # Pocoyo's New Toys # Bathing Loula # Magic Fingers # Cooking with Elly # Elly's Market # Pato's Bedtime # A Hole in One # Pocoyo's Camera # Painting with Pocoyo # Playing Dress Up # Magic Box # Pocoyo's Restaurant # Wake Up, Pocoyo! # Ahoy, Pocoyo! # Elly's Computer # Going To The Beach # Big and Small # Face Painting # Pocoyo's Supermarket # Elly's Playhouse # Pocoyo's Puppet Theatre # Up and Down # Pocoyo's Breakfast === Similar Videos === # Traffic Jam # Pato's Living Room # Cinema # Elly's New Doll # Circus # The Best Bedroom # Pocoyo Goes to School # Art # Pocoyo Recycles # Down on the Farm # Nurse Elly # Fishing with Pocoyo ===Season 4=== # Holidays # Christmas Tree # Chicks dig me # Call me # Muck Struck # Nina # Hack Attack # Hole Lotta Trouble # Great Shot! # Disco Fleaver # House of Colors # Summer Hike # Bumbleberry Surprise # Are we there yet? # Tourist Trapped # Time After Time Before Time # Tiny fun park # Halloween Tales # Rock is a hard place # Angry Alien Strikes Back # Magic Words # Sleep Guard # Insert Coin # Space postal service # An Alien Christmas Carol # Dance off part two ==References== Category:Children's television series Category:Animated television series",
