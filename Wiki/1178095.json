 "text": "The Persian Campaign occurred after the death of Shah Muhammad II of Khwarazm, whose son Mingburnu continued to offer Khwarezmian resistance to the Mongol invaders from Afghanistan and Persia. In 1224, the Mongol armies of Tolui Khan and Khubilai were forced to invade deeper into Persia to crush Khwarezm's resistance once and for all. The two armies besieged the new Khwarazmian capital, Yazd (it had been moved to Herat after the Mongols' conquest of Central Asia), and faced a garrison of 998 troops. The two armies, equipped with siege weapons, were instantly assaulted and captured the city, which they proceeded to destroy and abandon to allow their hordes to continue their rapid invasion of Persia. Having gathered an army and entered Persia, Jalal al-Din sought to re-establish the Khwarazm Empire, but he never fully consolidated his power. In 1224, he confirmed Burak Hadjib, the ruler of the Qara Khitai, in Kerman, and received the submission of his brother Ghiyath, who had established himself in Hamadan and Isfahan, and the province of Fars, and clashed with the Caliph al-Nasir in Khuzestan and captured parts of western Iran from him. ==References== 1\\. https://historica.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Yazd_(1224) 2\\. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalal_al-Din_Mangburni#Persia_and_Georgia",
