Many Native American groups lived near this area. By the 19th century, Fargo was part of Sioux (Dakota) territory. By 1859, there were many settlements in the Red River Valley. The area that is now Fargo was a stopping point for steamboats traveling across the Red River. In 1871, Centralia was established. However, the town was soon renamed to Fargo, after William Fargo. While Fargo was being developed, two separate towns started to form: \"Fargo on the Prairie\" and \"Fargo on the Timber\". Fargo on the Prairie was a tent town. It was said to be well-lead by both Northern Pacific Railway engineers and military officers. Fargo on the Timber was known for having lots of whisky and being lawless. In 1872, federal troops shut down Fargo on the Timber, leaving only Fargo on the Prairie. In 1875, Fargo was officially incorporated. == References == Category:County seats in North Dakota Category:1871 establishments in the United States Category:1870s establishments in Dakota Territory",
