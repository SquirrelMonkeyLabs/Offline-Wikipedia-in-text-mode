 "text": "The Turks in Germany are Germany's largest ethnic minority. Immigrants came from different parts of Turkey but especially from Anatolia, when Germany invited them to work as guest workers from 1961 to 73 because of labour shortages. Some of them have a Romanlar background. Most Turks in Germany are religious, and they cotinue old Turkish traditions such as the SÃ¼nnet (cirumcision) ceremony in great respect. Turks in Europe, especially in Germany, suffer from strong anti-Turkish sentiment. One of the worst anti- Turkish crimes in Germany was the murder of a Turkish family in Solingen in 1993. Attacks on Turkish institutions, mosques, markets and people are increasing, and some have been fatal. ==Related pages== * Migrant worker * Turkish people * Romanlar == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Germany",
