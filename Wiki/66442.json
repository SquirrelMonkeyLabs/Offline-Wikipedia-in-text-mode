This was when the Czech Republic and the Slovakia were one country. The company started flying domestically (only inside Czechoslovakia) in 1924. In 1930 they made their first international flight. CSA stopped flying between 1938 and 1945 when the country was occupied by Germany. When Czechoslovakia split into two countries, all of the Czechoslovak State Airlines stayed in the Czech Republic and became Czech Airlines.
