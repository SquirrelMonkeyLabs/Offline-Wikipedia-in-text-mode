 "text": "Flax (also known as common flax or linseed) (Linum usitatissimum) is a type of flowering plant. The fibres of flax are used to make linen. High-quality paper used in banknotes is also made from flax fibres. An oil (linseed oil) can be made from the dried ripe flax seeds. Flax has been used for a long time in such tasks as making bows and candles. ==Toxicity== Flax seed and its oil are nontoxic and are safe for human consumption. However, like many common foods, flax contains small amounts of cyanogenic glycoside. This is nontoxic when eaten in normal amounts. It may be toxic when eaten in large quantities as with staple foods such as cassava. The small percentage of cyanide can be removed by special processing. == References == ==Other websites== Category:Malpighiales Category:Edible nuts and seeds",
