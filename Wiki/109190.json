 "text": "Tangipahoa Parish is a parish in the U.S. State of Louisiana. The parish was put together from parts of 4 other parishes in 1869. Before it was a parish, many slaves were forced to work on sugar plantations in the area. After the Civil War, the white people continued to be very violent towards the black people they had enslaved. All across the south, there were lynchings against black people. Tangipahoa Parish had more lynchings than any nearby parish.Michael James Pfeifer, Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947, University of Illinois Press, 2004, pp. 83-84 ==References== == Other websites == * Visitor's Bureau website, Tangipahoa history Category:1869 establishments in the United States Category:1860s establishments in Louisiana",
