 "text": "The Bahmani Sultanate or the Bahmani Kingdom was a late medieval kingdom that ruled the Deccan plateau in India. The Bahmani Sultanate began to weaken during the rule of Mahmood Shah. A mix of internal conflicts and revolts by five provincial governors (called tarafdars) caused the Sultanate to break into five separate states, known as the Deccan Sultanates. The last independent Bahmani state, Golkonda, fell in 1518, ending the 180-year rule of the Bahmanis over the Deccan. By 1527, the Bahmani kingdom officially dissolved, with the last four sultans becoming puppet rulers under Amir Barid I of the Bidar Sultanate. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:Former monarchies of Asia Category:Former countries in South Asia",
