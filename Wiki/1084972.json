 "text": "TVP Info is a Polish free-to-air television news channel, run by the public state broadcaster TVP. It mostly broadcasts nationwide news bulletins. Until 20 December 2023, its main offices were in Warsaw Uprising Square. Since 29 December 2023 they are in the main TVP building on Woronicza Street, Warsaw. During the rule of the Law and Justice-majority government from 2015 to 2023, the channel was criticized by the opposition and external observers for airing government propaganda. On December 19, 2023, Bartłomiej Sienkiewicz, the Minister of Culture and National Heritage in Poland, dismissed the media directors and their supervisory boards, most notably those of TVP, appointing new ones in their place. The move was met with criticism and accusations of illegality by the dismissed management and the opposition Law and Justice party. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said this was done to restore legal order and decency in public life. Paweł Moskalewicz was appointed to run it by Tusk. ==References== Category:Polish culture Category:Television stations",
