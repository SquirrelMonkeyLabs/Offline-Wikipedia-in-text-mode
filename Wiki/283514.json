 "text": "Robert Marvin \"Bobby\" Hull, OC (January 3, 1939 – January 30, 2023) was a Canadian ice hockey left winger. Hull is highly regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time and perhaps the greatest left winger to ever play the game of hockey. Hull was known for his blonde hair, blinding skating speed, and having the fastest shot in the game which also earned him the nickname, \"the Golden Jet\". Hull played 17 seasons in the NHL with 3 teams, the Chicago Black Hawks for 15 seasons, the Winnipeg Jets for 1 season and the Hartford Whalers for 1 season. Hull was inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1954–55 St. Catharines Teepees OHA 6 0 0 0 0 — — — — — 1955–56 St. Catharines Teepees OHA 48 11 7 18 79 6 0 2 2 9 1956–57 St. Catharines Teepees OHA 52 33 28 61 95 13 8 8 16 24 1957–58 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 70 13 34 47 62 — — — — — 1958–59 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 70 18 32 50 50 6 1 1 2 2 1959–60 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 70 39 42 81 68 3 1 0 1 2 1960–61 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 67 31 25 56 43 12 4 10 14 4 1961–62 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 70 50 34 84 35 12 8 6 14 12 1962–63 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 65 31 31 62 27 5 8 2 10 4 1963–64 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 70 43 44 87 50 7 2 5 7 2 1964–65 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 61 39 32 71 32 14 10 7 17 27 1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 65 54 43 97 70 6 2 2 4 10 1966–67 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 66 52 28 80 52 6 4 2 6 0 1967–68 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 71 44 31 75 39 11 4 6 10 15 1968–69 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 74 58 49 107 48 — — — — — 1969–70 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 61 38 29 67 8 8 3 8 11 2 1970–71 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 78 44 52 96 32 18 11 14 25 16 1971–72 Chicago Black Hawks NHL 78 50 43 93 24 8 4 4 8 6 1972–73 Winnipeg Jets WHA 63 51 52 103 37 14 9 16 25 16 1973–74 Winnipeg Jets WHA 75 53 42 95 38 4 1 1 2 4 1974–75 Winnipeg Jets WHA 78 77 65 142 41 — — — — — 1975–76 Winnipeg Jets WHA 80 53 70 123 30 13 12 8 20 4 1976–77 Winnipeg Jets WHA 34 21 32 53 14 20 13 9 22 2 1977–78 Winnipeg Jets WHA 77 46 71 117 23 9 8 3 11 12 1978–79 Winnipeg Jets WHA 4 2 3 5 0 — — — — — 1979–80 Winnipeg Jets NHL 18 4 6 10 0 — — — — — 1979–80 Hartford Whalers NHL 9 2 5 7 0 3 0 0 0 0 NHL totals 1063 610 560 1170 640 119 62 67 129 102 WHA totals 411 303 335 638 183 60 43 37 80 38 ==Other websites== *Bobby Hull's NHL player profile *Bobby Hull at the Internet Hockey Database *Bobby Hull's Legend's of Hockey profile Category:1939 births Category:2023 deaths Category:Art Ross Trophy winners Category:Canadian ice hockey left wingers Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Hart Memorial Trophy winners Category:Hartford Whalers players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Lady Byng Memorial Trophy winners Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Winnipeg Jets (1979–96) players Category:World Hockey Association players",
