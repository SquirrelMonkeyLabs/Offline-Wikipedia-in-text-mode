 "text": "The Buffalo Bills are an American football team in Buffalo, New York. They are members of the Eastern Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). The Bills started playing in 1960 as an original member of the American Football League and joined the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger. The Bills won two American Football League titles in 1964 and 1965, but the team has not won a league championship since the merger. Buffalo is also the only team to win four consecutive AFC Championships (1990-93), though they did not win any of the four following Super Bowls. Ralph Wilson, the longtime owner who had established the Bills in 1959, died on March 25, 2014. On September 9, 2014, Wilson's family announced that it had sold the team to Terry Pegula and his wife, Kim. The Pegulas also own the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL. The Bills team name is based on the famous \"wild west show\" star known as Buffalo Bill. The American bison is the team symbol. This large mammal is commonly known in North America as the \"buffalo\", although it is only distantly related to other large mammals known as such. == Other websites == * Buffalo Bills - Official Site Category:1959 establishments in the United States Category:1950s establishments in New York (state) Category:1960 establishments in the United States Category:1960s establishments in New York (state)",
