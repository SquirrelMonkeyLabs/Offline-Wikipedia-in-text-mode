 "text": "A nodal plane is a plane, an area around an atom, in which the probability of finding an electron is zero.or we can also say nodal plane is a flat, 2-dimensional region in space where the electron's wavefunction () becomes zero. Since the probability of finding an electron in a region is proportional to , a nodal plane represents an area of zero electron density. Types of Nodes Nodes in an orbital are areas of zero probability for finding an electron. These can be classified as: 1\\. Radial Nodes: Spherical regions where the wavefunction is zero. Radial nodes are determined by the principal quantum number and the angular quantum number . Formula: Number of radial nodes = . 2\\. Angular Nodes (Nodal Planes): Flat planes (or conical regions) where the wavefunction is zero due to the angular part of the orbital. Number of angular nodes = , where is the azimuthal quantum number. Category:Physics",
