 "text": "An aggregate fruit is a fruit that develops from a single flower, but the flower has more than one ovary, and the ovaries join together as the fruit grows. A fruit that grows from just one flower that contains just one ovary, is not an aggregate fruit but a simple fruit. Not all flowers with multiple ovaries grow into aggregate fruit; the ovaries of some flowers do not become tightly joined together to make a larger fruit. Aggregate fruits may also be accessory fruits. In accessory fruits, parts of the flower that are not the ovary become juicy and form part of the fruit.
