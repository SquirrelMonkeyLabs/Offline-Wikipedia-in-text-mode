The bicameral system was replaced by the unicameral National Assembly of Venezuela. At the 1993 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the Chamber became a mixed member proportional representation system, modelled on the German system, with some variations.Crisp and Rey(2003:189)Crisp, Brian F. and Rey, Juan Carlos (2003), \"The Sources of Electoral Reform in Venezuela\", in Shugart, Matthew Soberg, and Martin P.
