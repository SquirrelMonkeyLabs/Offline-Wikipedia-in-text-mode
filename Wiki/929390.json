 "text": "A nursing home is a long term hospital for those too sick and or frail to take care of themselves. These facilities are for those who need intensive hospital-like care for longer than the typical recovery hospital stay. Nursing homes are primarily geared towards older people or senior citizens and 3 to 5 months is the average length of stay. Nursing homes provide more intensive care than most typical assisted living facilities. Elder abuse happens more in nursing homes than elsewhere. ==References== Category:Hospitals",
