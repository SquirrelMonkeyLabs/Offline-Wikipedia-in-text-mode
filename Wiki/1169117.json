On October 27, 1941, the British 151st Parachute Battalion, the British Indian Army 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion were combined to form the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade. In 1952, these and a few other battalions were combined to become the Parachute Regiment. The Parachute Regiment was created by separating the three battalions that were part of the Parachute Brigade from their respective Infantry Regiments. Since then, the Parachute Regiment has expanded to include Parachute (Special Forces) battalions, totaling ten battalions. Category:Indian military organizations",
