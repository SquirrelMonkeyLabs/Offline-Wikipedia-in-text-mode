 "text": "There are 23 counties in the U.S. state of Wyoming. First there were five counties in the Wyoming Territory. They were Laramie and Carter, formed in 1867; Carbon and Albany formed in 1868; and Uinta, an added portion of Utah and Idaho, extending from Montana (including Yellowstone Park) to the Wyoming- Utah boundary. On July 10, 1890, Wyoming was admitted to the Union with thirteen counties. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Wyoming's code is 56. When combined with any county code it would be written as 56XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county. ==List== County FIPS code County seat Formed from Meaning of name Population (2020) Area Map ==References== Wyoming *",
