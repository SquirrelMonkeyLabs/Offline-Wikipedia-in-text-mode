 "text": "Daniel Robitaille, mainly known as [the] Candyman, is a fictional character and slasher icon mainly in the Candyman series of movies. He is the main antagonist, but originates from Clive Barker's short story The Forbidden in 1985. In the movie series he is the evil ghost of an African-American man who was brutally lynched for a forbidden interracial love affair in the 19th century, and will haunt and kill anyone who calls the name of Candyman before a mirror five times in a row. He sometimes also targets those who openly deny the urban legend of his existence as a ghost. He kills people with a hook for a hand and slashes their chest or back open causing them to bleed to death. He is ninth in the list of slasher icons per kill count, with a total of 22 kills. He is played in Candyman (1992), Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh, Candyman: Day of the Dead and Candyman (2021) by actor Tony Todd. ==References== Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1985 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Movie characters",
