 "text": "The flag of Basel is the historical flag of the city and the canton of Basel, it is the peculiar heraldic shape of the crozier (the Baselstab or \"Basel staff\") dates to the 13th century, used in the seals of the bishops of Basel. It was introduced as heraldic emblem in 1385. From this time, the Baselstab in black represented the city, and the same emblem in red represented the bishop. The staff represented was based on an actual artefact, a gilded staff recorded for the 12th century. It is of unknown origin or significance (beyond its obvious status of bishop's crozier), but it is assumed to have represented a relic, possibly attributed to Saint Germanus of Granfelden.staatskanzlei.bs.ch The banner of the city of Basel with the same design was introduced in the early 15th century, as the city gained greater independence from the ruling bishops of Basel. The flag and coat of arms of Basel-Landschaft was introduced in 1834, from the coat of arms of Liestal. It represents red Baselstab historically used by the bishops, but with the addition of seven crockets (Krabben, in local dialect also dubbed Siebedupf) and turned to face sinister, representing the secession and \"facing away\" from the city. == References == Category:Cantonal flags Category:Basel Category:Flags of Europe",
