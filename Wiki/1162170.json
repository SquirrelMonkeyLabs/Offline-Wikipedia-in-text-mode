 "text": "George Walker Bush served as the 43rd President of the United States from January 20, 2001 - January 20, 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. He focused on education reform and fighting terrorism following the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks by the terrorist group Al Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden. In 2001, he declared war against al Queda and a country that supported al Queda, Afghanistan, led by the Taliban since 1996. In 2002, he controversially signed No Child Left Behind Act into law, which was ended in 2015 under President Barack Obama. In 2003, Bush ordered the military to invade Iraq on the false claims that Iraq had started making Weapons of Mass Destruction, which Iraq was banned from doing after the Gulf War from 1990-1991. In 2004, George W. Bush and his Vice President, Dick Cheney won reelection and was sworn in on January 20th, 2005. Later in 2005, a category 5 hurricane named Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Louisiana, though it had slowed down to a slightly slower category 3. Bush's reaction and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) poor management of rescue efforts to save victims of the disaster was heavily criticized. In 2008, the housing bubble burst, and resulted in the 2008 Great Recession, a period between 2008-2009 where 10 million Americans lost their homes and 7% of Americans (8.7 million people) lost their jobs as a result of the economy crashing. ==References== Category:George W.
