 "text": "Less Than Jake is an American ska punk band from Gainesville, Florida. ==Career== Before the band was started, lead vocalist and guitarist Chris DeMakes, drummer Vinnie Fiorello, and bassist Shaun Grief all led a local band called Good Grief while they were attending high school in Port Charlotte, Florida. When DeMakes decided to move north and attend the University of Florida, the band broke up. Less Than Jake was formed on July 13, 1992. The band got their name from Fiorello's dog, Jake, who was usually treated better than the rest of the household, so everything was \"less than Jake\". The band released their debut studio album, Pezcore on August 22, 1995 through Dill Records. Their eighth studio album See the Light was released on November 12, 2013. == Band members == ;Current *Chris DeMakes - Vocals and guitar (1992–present) *Vinnie Fiorello - Drums (1992–present) *Roger Manganelli - Vocals and bass (1993–present) *Buddy \"Goldfinger\" Schaub - Tenor trombone and backing vocals (1993–present) *Peter \"JR\" Wasilewski - Tenor saxophone and backing vocals (2000–present) ;Former *Jessica Mills — Alto saxophone (1993–1998) *Derron Nuhfer — tenor and baritone saxophone (1995–2000) *Pete Anna — tenor and alto trombone (1998–2001) == Discography == ===Studio albums=== *Pezcore (1995) *Losing Streak (1996) *Hello Rockview (1998) *Borders & Boundaries (2000) *Anthem (2003) *In with the Out Crowd (2006) *GNV FLA (2008) *See the Light (2013) ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:American punk bands Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Musical groups from Florida Category:Musical quintets Category:1992 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Florida",
