 "text": "Trams in Luxembourg operated between 1875 and 1964 as well as from 2017 onwards. Initially, various tram routes operated across the Luxembourg City, which operated between the late 19th and early 20th century. The tram lines all closed following the rise in automobile traffic in the city. In December 2017, the first section of the second generation of trams in Luxembourg opened with a piece of track running between Luxexpo and Route Breck Pafendall. Since then, the tram line has been expanded in several stages. The full route runs from Luxembourg Airport in Senningerberg to the Stade de Luxembourg. ==Other websites== * Luxtram.lu * Luxembourg tram and funicular at Public- transport.net * Luxembourg tram and funicular at Urbanrail.net Category:Tram transport Category:Luxembourg City",
