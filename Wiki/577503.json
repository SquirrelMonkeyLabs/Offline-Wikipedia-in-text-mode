 "text": "The Owen gun was an Australian 9mm submachine gun used in World War II. It was used by Australian soldiers who favoured it in jungle combat. Although used predominantly in the far east, it was considered the best submachine gun of WW2 as it was simple, rugged, had an ergonomic layout and had a compensator to increase accuracy when firing.
