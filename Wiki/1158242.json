 "text": "The Vienna Football Association (Germanː WFV-Wiener Fußball-Verband) is the leading body of football in the federal state of Vienna. ==History == In the beginning football in Vienna was organized by the Lower Austrian Football Association because Vienna was then part of Lower Austria. After lengthy discussions, the \"Separation Act\" was passed at the end of 1921 and Vienna became its own federal state on January 1, 1922. This also had an impact on the association and on February 15, 1923 it was divided into the Vienna Football Association and the Lower Austrian Football Association. The first president of the Vienna Football Association was Ignaz Abeles, who was the founding president of the NÖFV in 1911. During the economically difficult period between the wars, the clubs tried to stay afloat primarily through foreign tours. On March 13, 1937, the Vienna Association held its last general meeting for many years. In March 1938 Austria became part of Nazi-Germany. After professional football was abolished, a Gauliga was founded. A few days before the end of the war, on May 2, 1945, the first meeting of the Vienna Football Association took place under the leadership of Karl Zankl. The first round of the championship in the new Austria kicked off on September 1st and the first champions were once again Rapid. The big change came in 1949. The 1948/49 season was the last in which the \"big clubs\" took part in the Vienna championship. At an extraordinary meeting, the clubs decided to withdraw from the Vienna Association and found the State League. The \"Austrian State League\" was absorbed into the ÖFB on July 31, 1949 and the dominance of the Vienna Football Association was over. == Teams in the leagues == The following teams will play in Austrian leagues in the 2024/25 season Men * Austrian Football Bundesliga ** FK Austria Wien ** SK Rapid Wien * 2.
