 "text": "Desni Sektor UNA (Right Sector UNA) is a far-right nationalist political movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is known for its ultra-nationalist and ethnocentric views, with a strong focus on protecting the perceived cultural and national identity of the Bosniak populations. The movement is active in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and aligns with broader far-right trends in the region, which often include opposition to Serbs and support for strict nationalist ideologies. Desni Sektor UNA advocates for ethnically homogenous communities and frequently engages in anti-Serb, anti-Roma rhetoric. The group's ideology promotes a defensive stance against what they perceive as threats to Bosnian identity, especially in light of the socio- political environment post-Bosnian War,they believe that Bosnia should be a single state, without Serbs or Croats. The ideologies of Desni Sektor UNA are the same as in the older Bosnian Neo-Nazi group Bosnian Movement of National Pride which promote a nationalistic type of a \"Bosniak only\" state without Jews, Serbs, Croats and other minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
