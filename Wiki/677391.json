 "text": "On January 23, 2019, Pete Buttigieg, then-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced the formation of an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He formally announced his candidacy on April 14, 2019 in South Bend. He had been speculated as a potential candidate, visiting the early caucus state of Iowa in December 2018, where he announced he would not run for reelection in 2019. He would be the first openly gay elected official to run for president. Early on, Buttigeg would solidify himself as a candidate ready to \"turn the page\". He made every debate and proved he could hang with the bigger names such as Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden & Elizabeth Warren. He gained points in the polls, and during the Iowa Caucuses, he declared himself victorious before results came in during his speech. He seemed to have been right, as Buttigeg earned 14 delegates in Iowa. He earned 9 in New Hampshire the following week. However, Buttigeg only earned 3 in Nevada despite his efforts with the Latino/Mexican community. He earned none in South Carolina, where the black population is high. Buttigieg ended his campaign after losing the South Carolina primary on March 1, 2020.Epstein, Reid J. and Gabriel, Trip. \"Pete Buttigieg to Quit Democratic Presidential Race.\" The New York Times, March 1, 2020.
