 "text": "After seismic waves make a structure vibrate, a tuned mass damper (or seismic damper) can decrease their damaging effect and improve the building's seismic performance. Vehicles use small dampers and buildings use large ones. Some examples of dampers' design and implementation are presented in the images below: File:LRBtest.jpg|Heavy damping Lead-Rubber Bearing being tested at the UCSD facility.
