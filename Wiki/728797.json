 "text": "The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, often pronounced ) was the main channel of student activity to the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. They were a group of students who wanted to show segregation was wrong. They would sit in white only shops and cafes and refuse to move even if they were attacked. It was created in 1960 from the student-led sit-ins to protest segregated lunch counters in Greensboro, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee. The group was mainly founded and headed by Ella Baker. ==Other websites== *The SNCC Digital Gateway *The SNCC Project: A Year by Year History 1960–1970 *SNCC Actions 1960–1970 (map) *SNCC 1960 – 1966: Six years of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
