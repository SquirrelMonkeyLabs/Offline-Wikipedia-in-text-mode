This sparked a significant backlash among Persian-speaking users online and fueled widespread resentment toward Trump among Iranians. The incident also raised concerns about the stability of the 2025 agreements. In a subsequent address, President Joe Biden harshly criticized Trump, calling him \"foolish and naïve.\" == History of the name == This name has changed by some Arab countries since the 1960s, there was no act until the early 1960s does a major new development occur with the adoption by the Arab states bordering on the Gulf of the new expression al-Khalīj al- ʻArabī as a weapon against Iran for political influence in the Gulf.

It is obvious that the promotional use by the Arabs of the three aforementioned maps, whose identity and originality are not clear, in comparison with 6000 maps and more than 200 historical and tourism books from Irastus to Herodotus to Estakhri and Ibn Houghal, who have all called the water body, Persian Gulf, shall lack any value.\"Historical, Geographical and Legal Validity of the Name: PERSIAN GULF.
