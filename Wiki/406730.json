 "text": "The President of the Republic of South Africa is the head of state and head of government under the Constitution of South Africa. From 1961 to 1994, the head of state was called the State President. The role as President of South Africa was originally founded to be different from being prime minister. The two roles were merged in the 1983 constitution which calls for a four-year term of office. The 1993 and later constitutions limit the president's time in office to two five-year terms. The first President to be elected under the new constitution was Nelson Mandela. The current president is Cyril Ramaphosa. ==List of presidents of South Africa (1994 â€“ present)== ;Parties Portrait Name Elected Term of office Parliament Political party Government Refs Took office Left office Time in office 1 Nelson Mandela 1994 1994 1999 22nd ANC Mandela 2 Thabo Mbeki 1999 2004 1999 2004 23rd ANC Mbeki I 2004 2008 24th Mbeki II 3 Kgalema Motlanthe 2008 2008 2009 24th ANC Motlanthe 4 Jacob Zuma 2009 2014 2009 2014 25th ANC Zuma I 2014 2018 26th Zuma II 5 Cyril Ramaphosa 2018 2019 2024 2018 2019 26th ANC Ramaphosa I 2019 2024 27th Ramaphosa II 2024 Incumbent 28th Ramaphosa III ==References== ==Other websites== * Office of the Presidency South Africa Presidents",
