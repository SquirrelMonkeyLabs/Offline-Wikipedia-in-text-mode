 "text": "Jean-Luc Brunel (1946 â€“ 19 February 2022) was a French model scout and modelling agency manager. He was known for working for a modeling agency which was financed by Jeffrey Epstein. For thirty years, Brunel was accused of sexually harassing minors. His connections with Epstein became known, after Epstein's death. Brunel was accused of getting teenage girls and taking part of a sex trafficking ring run by Epstein. ==Arrest and indictment== He was arrested on 16 December 2020, and charged with the rape of minors by French prosecutors. In September 2021 he was indicted on a single count of rape [or for having raped one time]. The indictment came from an allegation that in the 1990s, Brunel drugged a 17-year-old model at a nightclub and raped her. Brunel said he was innocent. On 19 February 2022, Brunel was found dead in his jail cell in Paris after hanging himself. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Paris Category:Jeffrey Epstein Category:People accused of child sexual abuse Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Suicide in the 2020s Category:Suicides by hanging Category:Suicides in France",
