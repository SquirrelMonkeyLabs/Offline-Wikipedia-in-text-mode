 "text": "The 2024 Afghanistan–Pakistan clashes are a series of ongoing fights involving airstrikes and gunfire between the two countries. Armed groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Pakistani Taliban are also involved. Fighting has happened in many places along the border, such as North and South Waziristan, Wana, Dera Ismail Khan, Shangla, Khost, and Paktika. Later attacks also happened in Turbat and Gwadar, in Balochistan province, carried out by the BLA. These attacks targeted projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Pakistani military bases that host U.S. aircraft, putting Chinese and American interests at risk. After things calmed down in March 2024, the conflict flared up again in December 2024 when Pakistan launched airstrikes in Afghanistan's Paktika Province. The fighting in December marked the third time in less than two years that Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghanistan. The first set of airstrikes happened in 2022, the second took place in March 2024, and the most recent round occurred in December 2024. ==Related pages== *Afghanistan–Pakistan border conflicts ==References== Category:Wars involving Pakistan",
