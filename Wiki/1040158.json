 "text": "A yacht club is a sports club. It is for people who take part in yachting and sailing. Yacht clubs are usually by the sea. Club buildings will have a clubhouse where members can eat and drink, as well as a marina to dock and repair boats. In 1718, the Neva Yacht Club was created and is thought to be the oldest club in the World. Some people don't think this however. This is because the Neva Yacht Club was made unofficially under a decree by Tsar Peter the Great, it ended in 1917 because of the Russian Revolution and was restarted in 1958. The Royal Cork Yacht Club is also believed to be the oldest yacht club in the World. == References == Category:Sailing Category:Sports clubs",
