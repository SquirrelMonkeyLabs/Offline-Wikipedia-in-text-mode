 "text": "Eugènie Herlaar (Curaçao, 10 November 1939 – 14 August 2024) was a first news presenter. She is most known for being the first Dutch female news presenter of NOS Journaal in 1965. In the 1960s it was assumed female news presenters were not desirable, and turned out from a British test of the BBC. Herlaar wrote to the NOS, she was hired and she proved the opposite. She made many reports, including the announcement of the birth of Prince Willem-Alexander. She was praised for her 'velvet voice' and received multiple prizes including twice the Order of Orange-Nassau (member in 1998 and knight in 2008) and a prize in 1966 by the “Nederlandse Vereniging voor Slechthorenden”. Herlaar died on 14 August 2024 after a short illness at the age of 84.Eerste vrouwelijke NOS-nieuwslezer Eugènie Herlaar (84) overledenPionier Eugènie Herlaar, eerste vrouwelijke presentator NOS Journaal, overleden ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2024 deaths Category:Dutch journalists Category:Curaçao people",
