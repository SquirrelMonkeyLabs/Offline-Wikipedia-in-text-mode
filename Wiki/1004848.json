It is a non-profit members' organisation registered in Switzerland. It was started in Italy in 1933 by Francesco Braga. It has its main office in London, with more local offices in Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Nairobi. It has more than 8,000 members and operating in over 70 countries. It started by promoting laws and copyrights and \"to protect the largely British-based recording industry\" by promoting rights in gramophone sound recordings. In 1961 it helped to set up an international standard for the protection of sound recordings, live performances and broadcasts. The United States did not recognise a separate sound recording copyright until 1971. == References == Category:International organizations Category:Trade associations",
