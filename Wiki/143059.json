It entered its second generation in 2010. == Volvo S60 III (2019) == Production began in late 2018 in Ridgeville, South Carolina. A 2.3 million square foot plant built approximately 60,000 vehicles per year for the US and export markets. The capacity could go up to 100,000 vehicles per year if demand required it. The plant was the sixth Volvo, which joined two European sites, two Chinese and one Malaysian. It was expected that about 2,000 workers staffed the plant. In April 2017, the construction company completed the construction of the complex's hull. The third-generation S60 had the hybrid powertrain and was one of the five new electric models launched in 2019 with the second generation V60 and a fully electric sports coupe. The third generation of S60 and V60 was also available as Polestar models. Category:2000s automobiles Category:2010s automobiles S560",
