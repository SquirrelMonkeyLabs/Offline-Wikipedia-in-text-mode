 "text": "Rhabdomyolysis is where damaged skeletal muscles quickly break down. The symptoms can be muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There can also be confusion and tea-colored urine. Rhabdomyolysis can also injure the kidneys with myoglobin. The most common causes of Rhabdomyolysis are crush injury, strenuous exercise, medications, or drug abuse. During rhabdomyolysis, a protein that stores oxygen in the muscles called myoglobin is released into the blood. The kidneys filter the blood and remove the myoglobin. However, the myoglobin breaks down into other chemicals which damages the kidneys which can cause severe injury or even death. == References == Category:Health problems",
