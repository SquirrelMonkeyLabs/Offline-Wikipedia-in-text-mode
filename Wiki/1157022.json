 "text": "Session is a free and open source e2ee(end-to-end) encrypted anonymous cross- platform messenger created by OXEN community in 4 February 2020. Session messenger was created as a fork for signal which is another e2ee messenger that sends messages using on signal protocol. Session is a cross-platform messenger which means you can use on your Android, IOS, Windows, MacOS and linux at the same time. To do this you only need your 16-digit keys generated by session messenger. Session only allows you to send up to 10mb media which is less than other messengers. When you send a message to your friend, Session encrypts your message with AES key and sends message through the onion router which means nobody knows who you are sending your message or from whom you are receiving it. Also, Session has self-destructing mode from 5sec to 1week.",
