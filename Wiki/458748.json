But there were no permanent settlements in the area until the first Europeans arrived in the early 1840s. Queen Victoria made it the seat of an Anglican Bishopric in 1858 and Nelson became a city. The city grew slowly until the 1950s when it developed suburbs. Nelson remains a compact city with most attractions within walking distance.
