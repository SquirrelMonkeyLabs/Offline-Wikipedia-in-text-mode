 "text": "A gel is a semi-solid substance material which usually wobbles. By weight, gels are mostly liquid. But gels also behave like solids. They have a three- dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinks in the fluid that give a gel its structure. As colloids, gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid. In a gel, the solid is the continuous phase; the liquid is the discontinuous phase. Examples: Jellies, agar, contact lenses, organic slime. Category:Physical chemistry Category:Materials",
