 "text": "OpenSolaris was an open source Unix operating system from Sun Microsystems. It was based on Sun's non-free Solaris operating system. The operating system was known for its ZFS file system. In 2010, Oracle Corporation bought Sun Microsystems and chose to stop making new versions of OpenSolaris. OpenSolaris was later forked into the illumos kernel and the OpenIndiana distribution. == Other websites == * OpenSolaris (archived) * OpenIndiana (a fork of OpenSolaris) Category:Operating systems Category:Unix Category:Sun Microsystems Category:Oracle Corporation",
