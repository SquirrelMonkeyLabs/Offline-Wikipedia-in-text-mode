The people who lived there were called Illyrians and spoke the Illyrian languages. The Illyrians settled in the Balkans approximately around 2500 BC along with other Indo Europeans. The Illyrians became heavily romanised and a portion of them evolved into modern Albanians. ==Gallery== File:Illyrii Proprie Dicti aka Illyrians Proper aka Docleatae.svg File:Illyria and Dardania Kingdoms.png File:Map of the Kingdom of Agron of the Ardiaei (English).png File:KingdomofTeuta.png File:228-220BC-DemetriusofPharos.png == Other websites == * Illyria region in google map Category:History of Greece",
