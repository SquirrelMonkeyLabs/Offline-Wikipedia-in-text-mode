 "text": "The Soviet Navy () was the naval warfare uniform service branch of the Soviet Armed Forces. It was usually called the Red Fleet (). The Soviet Navy made up a large part of the Soviet Union's strategic planning if a war were to every start with the opposing superpower, the United States, during the Cold War period between the two countries. The Soviet Navy played a large role during the Cold War (1945-1991). It confronted the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in Western Europe and helped to keep the Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe. ==Fleets== The Soviet Navy was divided into four major fleets: the Northern, Pacific, Black Sea, and Baltic Fleets. It also had a smaller force, the Caspian Flotilla, which worked in the Caspian Sea and was followed by a larger fleet, the 5th Squadron, in the Middle East. The Soviet Navy included Naval Aviation, Naval Infantry, and the Coastal Artillery. ==Disestablishment== After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation took the largest part of the Soviet Navy and turned it into the Russian Navy. The rest of the Soviet Navy were given to the other post- Soviet states. == Inventory == In 1990, the Soviet Navy had: * 63 ballistic missile submarines: :: 6 Project 941 (Typhoon-class) submarines :: 40 Project 667B (Delta-class) submarines :: 12 Project 667A (Yankee-class) submarines :: 5 Project 658 (Hotel-class) submarines * 72 cruise missile submarines: :: 6 s :: 6 Yankee Notch submarines :: 14 s :: 30 s :: 16 s * 68 nuclear attack submarines: :: 5 s :: 2 s :: 6 s :: 46 s :: 6 s :: 3 Yankee SSN submarine * 63 conventional attack submarines: :: 18 s :: 20 s :: 25 s * 9 auxiliary submarines :: 1 :: 1 :: 2 s :: 4 s :: 1 * 7 aircraft carriers / helicopter carriers: :: 1 :: 4 s :: 2 s * 3 battlecruisers: :: 3 s * 30 cruisers: :: 3 s :: 7 s :: 4 s :: 10 s :: 4 s :: 2 s * 45 destroyers: :: 11 s :: 11 s :: 18 s :: 3 s :: 2 s * 113 frigates: :: 32 s :: 1 s :: 18 s :: 31 s :: 31 s * 124 corvettes: :: 10 s :: 36 s :: 78 s * 42 amphibious warfare ships: :: 3 s :: 19 s :: 14 s :: 6 s * ≈425 patrol boats == References == == Bibliography == * Goldstein, Lyle; Zhukov, Yuri (2004). \"A Tale of Two Fleets: A Russian Perspective on the 1973 Naval Standoff in the Mediterranean\".
