The story then follows the Black Bulls and other Magic Knight squads as they contend with the neighboring Diamond Kingdom and a mysterious terrorist organization known as the Eye of the Midnight Sun, whose leadership is revealed to reincarnated elves whose grudge against the Clover Kingdom is the result of a member of the Devil Race using them to bring his body into their world.
