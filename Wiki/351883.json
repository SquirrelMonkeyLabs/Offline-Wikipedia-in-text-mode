 "text": "Little Bentley is a village and civil parish in Tendring, Essex, England. In 2001 there were 312 people living in Little Bentley.{{Cite web The main cluster of houses in the parish is around the small green in front of the Bricklayers' Arms pub. The old rectory and the newest houses in the village are nearby. Smaller groups of houses are located some distance away at Ravens' Green, Monkey Street (on the Harwich Road), and near St Mary's parish (Anglican) Church. In the latter area are Lt Bentley Manor, and Lt Bentley Hall, which has a notable garden with water features and periodically hosts public events. Lt Bentley Wood, hetween the Hall and Raven's Green, is a large area of mainly coppiced chestnut trees. The Church is mainly Early English, but with early 17th century brickwork and windows on the south side. The timber roof has Medieval cross beams--whose angel heads were cut off by the Puritna iconoclast Dowsing in the Civil War. The small village hall, originally a school stands in front. A non-Conformist chapel, last used by the Datchet fellowship, is halfway between the Church and the pub, but has been unused for decades. A number of small industrial projects take place at Hall Farm, and Brampton Hall Farm at Ravens' Green, but most of the land in the parish is arable farmland. The A133 main road borders the parish on the south, and the A120 dual carriageway cuts across it in the north. Driving between the two through the small lanes in the parish (unless essential) is strongly disrecommended owing to their extreme narrowness and blind bends--and has been the subject of local protests. |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b;=794645&c;=Little+Bentley&d;=16&e;=15&g;=446880&i;=1001x1003x1004&o;=1&m;=0&r;=1&s;=1341487808608&enc;=1&dsFamilyId;=779 |title=Neighbourhood Statistics |access-date=2012-07-05 |archive- date=2016-03-05 |archive- url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305090506/http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b;=794645&c;=Little+Bentley&d;=16&e;=15&g;=446880&i;=1001x1003x1004&o;=1&m;=0&r;=1&s;=1341487808608&enc;=1&dsFamilyId;=779 |url-status=dead }} == References == ==Other websites== Category:Villages in Essex [[Category:Civil parishes in Essex]",
