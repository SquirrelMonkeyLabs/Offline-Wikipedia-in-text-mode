He was the son of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Joan of England. During the Albigensian Crusade in May of 1216, he set out from Marseille and besieged Beaucaire, which he captured on August 24. He fought to get the county of Toulouse back from Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester and later Simon's son Amaury VI of Montfort. When Raymond died, Alphonse became count of Toulouse, and after Alphonse's death the county was captured by France. Raymond VII was buried beside his mother Joan in Fontevrault Abbey.
