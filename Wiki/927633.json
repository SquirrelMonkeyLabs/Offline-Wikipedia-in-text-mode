 "text": "== Vertical forms of the Periodic System of Elements == The German physician, physicist and chemist Julius Lothar Meyer developed a table of elements of a horizontal form in 1862 and an expanded version in 1864 Julius Lothar Meyer. And after the Russian chemist Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev published a draft version of the Periodic Table of Chemical Elements of vertical form in 1869, Julius Lothar Meyer published the vertical form of the Periodic Table of Elements of his edition in 1870. Thus, an important difference between the Periodic Table of Elements according to Meyer and the Periodic Table of Elements according to Mendeleev became apparent. But Mendeleev from 1970-1971 began to display his edition of the Periodic Table of Elements only in horizontal form. It is likely that the unnatural separation of the first elements in the periods from the subsequent elements by meticulous scientists and ordinary people would not be perceived as an unnatural soaring. Meyer ended the periods on an element of the group of alkaline earth metals. And Mendeleev ended the periods on the element of the halogen group. Therefore, in Meyer's Periodic Table of Elements there are no gaps between the first 1, 2 or 3 elements and subsequent elements in the second and subsequent periods. In the Periodic Table of Elements according to Mendeleev, the first two (after the discovery of noble gases in 1902 - three) elements hang unnaturally above the subsequent elements of the periods, there is no such incident in the Periodic Table of Elements according to Meyer. The Swiss chemist Alfred Werner published his own edition of the horizontal form of the Periodic Table of Elements in 1905, where he finished the periods on the element of the noble gases group. Where the first two elements in the periods were displayed in isolation from the subsequent elements of the periods. Many scientists attributed this edition of the Periodic Table of Elements to Mendeleev. Here are the modern editions of the Periodic Table of Elements according to Meyer, Mendeleev and Werner. ~~~~ ~~~~ Category:Periodic table",
