 "text": "The Colour Strike was industrial action by technicians working for the ITV network. It was from 13 November 1970 to 8 February 1971. The strike was caused by a pay dispute between the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians (ACTT) and the management of the ITV companies. == History == At the time, ITV had recently switched to transmitting programs in coulor. This needed new equipment. The cameras had four tubes: three were for the colour information (Red, Green and Blue) and one for the black and white information (called luminance). The black and white information was needed as most houses didn't have televisions that could show a colour picture. The technicians on strike turned off the colour tubes causing the cameras to only pick up the black and white signal and therefore causing the programs to be recorded in black and white. Because of the strike, the ITV companies couldn't sell advertisement spaces for the higher price that colour demanded. == Affected Shows == === ATV === *The Golden Shot (series three, episodes 10 to 21) *Timeslip (episodes 23 and 24) *Crossroads (all episodes aired between 17 November 1970 and 12 February 1971) *Hine *The Misfit *The Dickie Henderson Show *Girls About Town (series two, episodes 4 to 7) === Granada === * Coronation Street (all episodes aired between 16 November 1970 and 10 February 1971). *A Family at War (series two, episodes 12 to 19). *Nearest and Dearest (series five, episodes 2 to 8). === Yorkshire === *Dear Mother...Love Albert (series three) *Hadleigh (series 2, episodes 1, 2, 8, 9 and 13) *Queenie's Castle (series one, episodes 3 to 6) *Mr Digby, Darling (series three) Category:ITV (TV network)",
