 "text": "The lesser bandicoot rat (Bandicota bengalensis) is a rodent. It lives in south Asia. It can grow up to 40cm long. It is a rat, but is not in the genus Rattus. They may be a pest to cereal crops, and gardens in India and Sri Lanka. When attacking the rat grunts like a pig. Their fur is dark brown on the back and usually lighter or darker grey on the belly-side (ventrally). The length of their body is about 25cm, and the tail is shorter than the body. == Location == Sometimes, the rats live in empty houses in villages. When they feel threatened, they are very aggressive. Many see them as a threat to infants (babies). Packs of lesser bandicoot rats have been known to attack and devour infants left alone. == Misunderstandings == Despite its name, the rat is not related to the bandicoot, which is a marsupial. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says there are large numbers of lesser bandicoot rats found over a wide area. They have listed them as being of Least Concern for survival. ==References== Category:Old World rats and mice Category:Mammals of Asia",
