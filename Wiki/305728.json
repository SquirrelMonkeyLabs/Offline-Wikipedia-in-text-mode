IPSA : 50 ans aver l'aéronautique Twenty students started the training.Book AAEIPSA - 50 ans d'histoire p.55 At that time, the course was in four years and the first promotion is graduated in 1965. The same year, the Alumni association is created in Paris by Maurice Ribonnet.Book AAEIPSA - 50 ans d'histoire p.64 In 1982, the first trip for students is organized in Guyana at the European Space Agency center.Book AAEIPSA - 50 ans d'histoire p.79 The year 1987 saw the university bought by Henri Hertert (IPSA 1976 and pilot at Air France).Book AAEIPSA - 50 ans d'histoire p.84 The institute moved in 1989 into the towers Les Mercuriales at Bagnolet, in which it stayed for ten years. Then, beset by financial difficulties, the university is bought by IONIS Education Group in 1999 and moved at Le Kremlin-Bicêtre close to the university EPITA. === 1999 - today === In 2005, the Master issued by IPSA is recognized by French State at the higher level, after accreditation by the Commission nationale de la certification professionnelle. Résumé descriptif de la certification The year 2006 sees the institute hosting the 6th European Congress of the Mars Society to promote the exploration of Mars. L’Architecture Martienne In 2007, IPSA opens a second campus in Toulouse, joins the Erasmus programme and concludes double degree agreements with foreign universities. Following its establishment in Toulouse, the university joins the Institut au service du spatial, de ses applications et technologies Membres de l'ISSAT during the year 2008. The next year, IPSA joins Aerospace Valley LISTE DES MEMBRES and moved in Ivry-sur-Seine close to the university ESME-Sudria, IPSA - Ouverture d’une 3ème année à Toulouse et déménagement à Ivry before being recognized by the French State in 2010. Arrêté du 14 avril 2010 portant reconnaissance par l'État de l'Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées In 2011, the university is accredited by the Commission des titres d'ingénieur. Ingénieur diplômé de l'Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées Formation initiale sous statut d'étudiant In January 2013, IPSA became member of the Conférence des directeurs des écoles françaises d'ingénieurs. Institut polytechnique des sciences avancées === History of directors === The current director is Anne-Ségolène Abscheidt, who is also vice-president of Ingénieurs et scientifiques de France. This is the tenth person to hold that function since 1961. She was appointed director of IPSA in June 2023.

He is a member of the four directorates of the university: L'équipe * Development and international relations directorate which also managed the communication and admissions ; * Training directorate with a manager for the Bachelor cycle and another one for the Master cycle ; * Corporate relations directorate ; * Research and quality directorate. == Training and research == === Curriculum === IPSA wants to be close to other universities with a strong theoretical training for research and development jobs in order to graduate engineer in aeronautical and space engineering with a good general knowledge in aerospace. IPSA Paris The course is in five years with five possibilities in the fourth year: Année d'études AERO 4 \"energy, spacecraft propulsion and engine\", \"mechanics and aircraft structure\", \"telecommunications, radar and radio navigation\", \"embedded system\", \"mechatronics\". The students choose also one minor from ten: \"Entrepreneurship\", \"business marketing\", \"association management\", \"Research Management\", \"Conduct of an international project\", \"project personnel development\", \"Board and consulting\", \" human resource management\", \"cultural management\", \"financial management\". In the fifth year, four options are available independently of the choice made in the fourth year: Année d'études AERO 5 \"Avionics\", \"Aeronautical Systems Design\", \" Space Systems Design\" and \"Management and Industrial Logistics\". The particularity of the university is to offer from the first year lessons relating to aeronautics in addition to basic scientific education and to provide a large part in project-based teaching throughout the curriculum. Students also have the opportunity to attend a technical and managerial course sanctioned by a Master of Business Administration in \"business and international negotiation\" of the Institut supérieur de gestion in addition to the diploma of the university, or to make the last year of studies in a foreign university in partnership with IPSA. Eleven months of internship are planned in the curriculum. After graduation, graduates are represented by the association AAEIPSA (IPSA Alumni association). Association des Anciens Élèves de l'IPSA (AAEIPSA) They work, for 70% of them, in the aerospace industry, mainly in research and development (46%) and in the Île-de-France region (57%). Admission to the university is possible after a Baccalauréat by succeeding to the competition \"Advance\" organized in partnership with EPITA and ESME-Sudria. In total, the three universities offer approximately 900 places. ESME Sudria : implantation à Lille et Lyon, nouveau campus à Paris, nouveau concours Advance et intégration dans APB It is also possible to integrate the university in the second, third or fourth year studies for students coming from a two-years degree after the Baccalauréat, Bachelor or Master. IPSA Ivry-sur-Seine Since 2017, IPSA has also some Bachelor's degree program in aerospace.Orientation : l'Ipsa ouvre des bachelors d'aéronautique === International relations === Partnerships allowing students to obtain a Master of Science with the degree of IPSA exist with Shenyang University in China, Succès pour la première promotion d'élèves de l'IPSA en Chine Cranfield University in UK,European Partnership Programme : Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avancées Moscow State University in Russia, the Université Laval in Canada Partenaires du département de génie mécanique and the National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan Aéronautique : 30 étudiants de l’IPSA bientôt en stage à Tainan .Taïwan Students can also use the Erasmus programme.

The laboratory of 3D computer graphics and calculation creating new algorithms to solve problems of processing and analysis of signals and images. It works in partnership with the laboratoire des signaux et systèmes (L2S) (signals and systems laboratory) (agreement signed in 2010), a laboratory of the French National Centre for Scientific Research based at Supélec. IONIS Mag, n° 12, p. 15 IPS'action association has launched in 2006 the « UNIV'air » challenge in order to present to people research projects in partnership with the Association Aéronautique et Astronautique de France and other universities such as the École nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace or EPF. La Lettre numéro 5 In 2008, an aircraft without pilot project named « Hélitronix » and realized by students and researchers of the mechatronics laboratory was selected during the « Minidrone » challenge funded by the General Directorate for Armament and organized by the Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales. Hélitronix, le projet des étudiants de l’IPSA sélectionné The same laboratory works on the « Perseus project » which consists of the development of rockets from the Centre national d'études spatiales, in partnership with « AéroIPSA » student association.Book AAEIPSA - 50 ans d'histoire p.46 Moreover, IPSA participates to « ASTech Paris Région ». Les membres It contributes at its development in many sectors : aircraft engine, onboard energy, aircraft design, material, training and research, and maintenance. In November 2011, the fluid mechanics applied to aerodynamics laboratory created in 2009 has adopted a new calculation tool allowing for the end of 2011 the commissioning of a digital wind tunnel.
