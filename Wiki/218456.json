 "text": "A hypothetical imperative is a rule of the form If you want x, then do y. Moral theories may generally have this structure. This means that only those who want x, must do y. Another view is that moral values are not relative to some objective, but are the same for all, that is they are unconditional, or categorical. for example, if you wish to do well in exams, you can study. But this doesn't stop you from not studying - studying is a hypothetical imperative which is entirely optional. However, not stealing is a categorical imperative: It is to be obeyed at all times, whether you like it or not. For example, you cannot steal bread, even if it means you will die. The term was coined by Immanuel Kant, and is the opposite of Categorical imperatives. Category:Philosophy",
