Not only did he translate Buddhist texts, but he also made a complete system of methods to reach Enlightenment, or the state of a Buddha. Marpa made three difficult journeys to India and spent about twenty years there. He received teachings and oral transmission of many gurus. Most important among them are Naropa and Maitripa. His main student and successor to his lineage is Milarepa. Category:1012 births Category:1097 deaths Category:Tibetan Buddhist lamas",
