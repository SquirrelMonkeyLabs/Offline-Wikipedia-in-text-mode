 "text": "Taylor's bug-eyed frog, purple-spotted warted frog, spotty warted tree frog, stellar bug-eyed frog, or Chantaburi bug-eyed tree frog (Theloderma stellatum) is a frog. It lives in Thailand and Cambodia. Scientists think it may also live in Myanmar. People have seen this frog in evergreen forests in low places and on mountains. For part of the year, these forests fill with water. The female frog lays eggs on the inside of a tree with water in it. She lays the eggs above the water. When they hatch, the tadpoles fall in. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but it is in some danger because human beings change the places where it lives to get wood to build with and build farms. People also take away some trees to make safrole oil, even though this is against the law. Scientists also think that people may catch this frog to sell because it is so beautiful. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Central Cardamoms Protected Forest, Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Soi Daow Wildlife Sanctuary. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
