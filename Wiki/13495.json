 "text": "A spin-off is something new that comes from something already present. If military technology finds civilian use, for example, that is one kind of spin- off. It is often used for video games, movies, and television programmes, but it can also be used when talking about companies or organisations. A spin-off may have the same people, places, themes or ideas as the original. ==Spin-offs in television== * Frasier (spin-off from Cheers) * Angel (spin-off from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) * The Facts of Life (spin-off of Diff'rent Strokes) * She- Ra: Princess of Power (spin-off from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe) * Daria (spin-off from Beavis and Butthead, which was a spin-off from Liquid Television) * The Simpsons (spin-off from The Tracey Ullman Show) * Torchwood (spin-off from Doctor Who) *Jack and the Pack and All Engines Go (spin-off from Thomas and Friends) * A.N.T.
