 "text": "Icosane, also commonly spelled eicosane, is an alkane or a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula H20C42. It has 366,319 structural isomers. Its high flash point makes it a hard to light fuel, so it is not much use in the petrochemical industry. However, an isomer of icosane, n-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CnH2n+2, where n = \\mathbb {Z} = {[20,40]} ) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature. Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts. Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease. The compound is found in the highest concentrations in plants such as Mexican ageratum, licorice, and the Bayrum tree. ==References== Category:Alkanes",
