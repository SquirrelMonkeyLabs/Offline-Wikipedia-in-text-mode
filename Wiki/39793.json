 "text": "Kalki is the final avatar or incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. Hindus believe that there are four stages of time. The stage of time we are in is called the Kali Yuga. In this stage of time, people are very bad. To restore Dharma in the world, Kalki will come to Earth, and will destroy the bad things and kill the bad people. People will change then, and become good people. A new stage of life will begin, called the Satya Yuga or the first stage of life. He is deciding to only come when everybody on Earth is very cruel. Kalki will come after Buddha, his work is to punish people who have not changed their behaviors' even after Buddha taught the right way. Kalki will come within this millennium. He will take birth in India. Lord Kalki will be expected to incarnate on the Shukla Paksha Dwadashi Tithi(12th day of the bright fortnight) in the Hindu month Vaishakha. According to some beliefs, he will appear at the end of this Kali Yuga which is about 432,000 years away. The Shrimad Bhagwat Purana describes in detail the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. There is a description of Lord Kalki in the second chapter of the 12th wing of the same Purana. In which it is said that Lord Kalki will be born as a son in the house of an ascetic Brahmin named Vishnu Yasha at a place called Shambhala. Lord Kalki will destroy the sinners from the world by riding on a horse or vehicle named Devadatta and re-establish religion. == References == Category:Hinduism Category:Hindu mythology",
