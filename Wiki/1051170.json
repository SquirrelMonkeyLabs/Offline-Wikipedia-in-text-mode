Usully, such kits contain tools to provide shelter against the elements, help them to keep warm, have a means to signal to rescuers and finding the way back to help. Such kits also contain food and water, for a short period of time. They also contain a first aid kit. Supplies in a survival kit normally include a knife (often a Swiss army knife or a multi-tool), matches, tinder, first aid kit, bandana, fish hooks, sewing kit, and a flashlight. People who work in remote locations, or in those with extreme climates usually have a survival kit. Such people include forestry workers, surveyors, and bush pilots.
