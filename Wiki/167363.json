 "text": "The Trump International Hotel and Tower is a skyscraper in Chicago, United States. It is 415 meters (1,362 feet) tall and has 96 floors. It was built in 2009 and is one of the tallest buildings in the world. It is the seventh largest skyscraper in the USA (behind the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower). It is the second tallest tower in Chicago. ==Location== The tower is at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the River North Gallery District, part of the Near North Side community area of Chicago. The building is on the site that used to be the Chicago Sun-Times building, one of the city's two major newspapers. It is on the north side of the Chicago River just west of the Wrigley Building and the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and just east of Marina City and 330 North Wabash. ==Height== The Trump International Hotel and Tower rises from the building's main entrance on Wabash Avenue to the tip of the architectural spire. Upon its completion in 2009, the building became the seventh-tallest building in the world, behind the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. On November 17, 2009, however, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which creates the rankings of the tallest skyscrapers in the world based on various criteria, changed its standard for measuring a building's height. As the Trump International Hotel and Tower has a riverwalk entrance and pedestrian level below the building's Wabash Avenue entrance, the skyscraper's official height was recalculated as without a physical addition to the structure. This made the tower the sixth-tallest building in the world, passing the Jin Mao Tower by . In January 2010, the building moved back to its position as seventh-tallest with the opening of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. ==Sign== According to Donald Trump, he received approval for a sign from Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to put a stainless steel letters back-lit with white LED lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his plans for the sign public in February 2014. The five letters span a width of about , making the final approved version about , according to some sourcesrather than the originally proposed size. The sign is about above ground level. Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded \"As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign\"; architect Adrian Smith was against the sign saying \"Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!\" The sign was controversial as several Chicagoans and local politicians criticized Trump's sign. As a result, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel created a study to change the rules of future sign- building on skyscrapers in the city. In the aftermath of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, city alderman Gilbert Villegas proposed a new law that would prevent any renewal of sign permits to persons convicted of \"treason, sedition or subversive activities\", specifically targeting the sign. ==Related pages== * List of tallest buildings in Chicago * List of tallest buildings in the world ==References== == Other websites == * * Official Website * Emporis.com - Trump International Hotel & Tower * SkycraperPage.com â€“ Trump International Hotel & Tower Category:Skyscrapers in Chicago Category:Donald Trump Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 21st century Category:2009 establishments in Illinois",
