His first movie, Un Chien Andalou, was called \"the most famous short [movie] ever made\" by critic Roger Ebert, and his last movie, That Obscure Object of Desire, won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. ==References== Category:BAFTA Award winning writers Category:1900 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Deaths from cirrhosis Category:Mexican screenwriters Category:Spanish movie directors Category:Spanish screenwriters Category:Mexican movie directors",
