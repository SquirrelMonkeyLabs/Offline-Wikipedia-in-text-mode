 "text": "The NSDAP 25 points manifesto is a 25-point plan written by Anton Drexler and edited and supported by Adolf Hitler for the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), the Nazi Party, when it was founded in 1920. Hitler explained the purpose of the 25 points in his book Mein Kampf. In the fifth chapter of the book's second volume, he wrote: ==The manifesto in detail== (This is a simple English translation of the original NSDAP manifesto of 1920; unnecessary or explanatory text has been left out) # We want all Germans to live in \"Germany.\" Großdeutsches Reich # We want Germany to be treated the same as other nations, and we want the peace treaties of Versailles to be cancelled. # We want land and territory (colonies) to feed our people and to settle our surplus population. # Only Germans may be citizens of Germany. Only those of German races may be members of the nation; their religion does not matter. However, no Jew may be a citizen.because they are not of a German race # Non-citizens may live in Germany, but there will be special laws for foreigners living in Germany.in most countries foreigners cannot own land or houses for example # Only citizens can vote for parliament and councils, or vote on laws. Everyone who works for the German government, a state government or even a small village must be a citizen of Germany. We will stop giving people jobs because of the political party they are in. Only the best people should get a job. # We think that the government's first job is to make sure every citizen has a job and enough to eat. If the government cannot do this, people who are not citizens should be made to leave Germany. # No-one who is not of a German race should be allowed to live in Germany. We want anyone who is not of a German-race who started living in Germany after 2 August 1914 to leave the country. # All citizens shall have equal rights and duties. # Every citizen should have a job. Their work should not be selfish, but help everyone. Therefore we demand # The abolition of incomes unearned by work. The breaking of the slavery of interest # So many people die or lose their property in a war, it is wrong for other people to make money from the war. Anyone who made money from the war should have all that money taken away. # We want all very big corporations to be owned by the government. # Big industrial companies should share their profits with the workers. # We want old age pensions to be increased. # We want: #* to create a healthy middle class #* to split up big department stores, and let small traders rent space inside them #* to make State and town governments try to buy from small traders. # We want to change the way land is owned. We also want: #* a law to take over land if the country needs it, without the government having to pay for it; #* to abolish ground rent; and #* to prohibit land speculation (buying land just to sell to someone else for more money). # Crimes against the common interest must be punished with death. # We want the Roman law system changed for the German common law system. # We want to change the system of schools and education, so that every hard-working German can have the chance of higher education. #* Lessons should concentrate on practical things #* Schools should teach civic affairs, so that children can become good citizens #* If a poor parent cannot afford to pay, the government should pay for education. # The State must protect health standards by: #* protecting mothers and infants #* stopping children from working #* making a law that requires people to do gymnastics and sports #* supporting sports clubs for young men # We want to get rid of the old army and replace it with a people's army that would look after the ordinary people, not just the rich officer-class # We want the law to stop politicians from being anti-German, and to stop newspapers from writing about them. To make a German national press, we demand: #* that all editors of, and writers in the German-language newspapers are members of the nation (of a German race); #* Foreign newspapers need permission from the government. They must not be printed in the German language; #* Non-Germans cannot own or control German newspapers. #** any non German who does own or control a newspaper will be made to leave Germany, and the newspaper closed down #* Newspapers which criticise the country or the government are not allowed. #* Art and books which support foreign ideas should be banned. # We want to allow all religions in the State, unless they offend the moral feelings of the German race. The NSDAP is Christian, but does not belong to any denomination. The NSDAP will fight the Jewish self-interest spirit, and believes that our nation will be strongest only if everyone puts the common interest before self-interest. # We will #* create a strong central government for the Reich; #* give Parliament control over the entire government and its organizations; #* form groups based on class and job to carry out the laws in the various German states. The leaders of the Party promise to work—if need be to sacrifice their very lives—to put this programme into action. ==Notes== Category:Nazism Category:1920s in Germany",
