 "text": "Celeste is a 2018 platformer developed and published by Maddy Makes Games. ==Gameplay== In Celeste, the main character and player, 'Madeline' has three simple moves, jumping, climbing, and dashes. Advanced moves involve combinations of the three. == Story == Celeste's story revolves around Madeline (the main character), Granny (an elderly woman who guides Madeline), Badeline (the personification of Madeline's anxiety and depression, called 'Part of You' in game, but commonly referred to as Badeline in the community and in the game files), and Theo (a fellow climber who joins you occasionally). The first 7 chapters of the game involve Madeline trying to climb Celeste mountain, which serves as a metaphor for dealing with mental health. == References == Category:2018 video games Category:Climbing and mountaineering video games Category:Game jam video games Category:Indie video games Category:LGBT-related video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about mental health Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games",
