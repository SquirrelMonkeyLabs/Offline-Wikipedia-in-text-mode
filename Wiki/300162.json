 "text": "Basic Instinct is a 1992 American erotic thriller. The movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven and stars Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. Douglas plays a San Francisco police detective who investigates the murder of a rich rock star. During this investigation he gets personally involved with the prime suspect, Catherine Tramell (played by Stone), having an affair with her. The movie generated a lot of controversy due to its strong and graphic violence and violent sex scenes. It was strongly opposed by gay rights activists for its portrayal of a bisexual woman as a narcissistic psychopath. The movie was given mixed reviews, but it took in millions at the box office. It was originally under a rating of NC-17. It was later edited down for an R rating before release. It was followed by a sequel, Basic Instinct 2. == Other websites == * Category:1992 crime thriller movies Category:1990s erotic movies Category:1992 LGBT movies Category:1990s mystery movies Category:1990s serial killer movies Category:American crime thriller movies Category:American erotic movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:American mystery movies Category:American serial killer movies Category:British crime thriller movies Category:British LGBT movies Category:French thriller movies Category:French LGBT movies Category:Antisocial personality disorder in fiction Category:1990s English-language movies Category:BDSM in movies Category:Film noir Category:LGBT crime movies Category:LGBT erotic movies Category:LGBT thriller movies Category:Movies about writers Category:Movies set in San Francisco Category:Narcissism in fiction Category:NC-17 rated movies Category:Movies directed by Paul Verhoeven Category:Movies composed by Jerry Goldsmith Category:Obscenity controversies",
