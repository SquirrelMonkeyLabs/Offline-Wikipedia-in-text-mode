 "text": "Ross Bridge is an historic bridge in the town of Ross in central Tasmania, Australia, completed in July 1836. It crosses the Macquarie River. It replaced an earlier bridge built in 1822 made of uncemented stone piers, with a road surface of logs and clay. This bridge was repaired after several piers fell down in 1828, and the bridge finally collapsed in 1831. The sandstone bridge was built by convicts. It is the third oldest bridge still in use in Australia. The bridge was designed by architect John Lee Archer. Several attempts were made to build a new bridge. Corrupt officials sold materials the government had bought to make the bridge. Archer changed his designs, and a number of different overseers were put in charge. It was not until two convict stonemasons, James Colbeck and Daniel Herbert joined the building team that any progress was made. In 13 months they completed the bridge on which work had started seven years earlier. Herbert is responsible the detailed carvings along both sides of the bridge. The bridge was opened by the Governor of Tasmania, George Arthur, on 21 October, 1836. The bridge was registered on the Register of the National Estate in 1978. ==References== * ==Further reading about the Bridge== * R Smith, Early Tasmanian bridges, Launceston, 1969; * L Newitt, Convicts & carriageways, Hobart, 1988. ==Other websites== * Tasmanian Times stories focusing on the likenesses of Jorgen Jorgenson * Sydney Morning Herald Travel article about Ross * Tasmanian visitors' guide tourism article about Ross * Ross Bridge on the Australian Heritage Database Category:Bridges in Australia Category:Stone bridges Category:Buildings and structures in Tasmania Category:1836 establishments Category:1830s establishments in Australia",
