 "text": "Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? is a television game show based on asking grade-school level questions to adults. The format started with the United States version, which first aired on FOX in February 2007. The show was created by Mark Burnett, the same person behind the hit show Survivor. The show has since been made in many other countries; some use the same title, and some use different titles. In Australia, the show is on the Ten Network. The top prize is AU$500,000. A syndicated version of the show aired in the United States from September 2009 to March 2011. Contestants answer eight questions (ten in Season 1), and can answer a 5th grade bonus question for ten times the amount they earned from those questions. Unlike other versions of the show, the game does not end after a wrong answer. Instead, the contestant loses their earnings up to that point. ==References== Category:2007 television series debuts Category:Fox television series Category:First run syndicated television programs Category:Television game shows",
