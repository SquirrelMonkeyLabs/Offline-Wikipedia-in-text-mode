 "text": "The reticulated poison frog, red back poison frog, or redbacked poison frog (Ranitomeya reticulata) is a frog. It lives in Peru and Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 13.0 to 15.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 14.0â€“17.0 mm long. The top of the head and skin of the back are a color red that looks like metal or brown-red. Some frogs have black spots. The tops of the four legs, sides, and belly are gray or blue-gray with black marks. ==Name== Scientists named this frog reticulata in Latin because the pattern on its belly and legs is called \"reticulated\" in English. ==Home== This frog lives in rainforests that have never been cut down and in rainforests that have been cut down and are growing back. People have seen this frog between 150 and 340 meters above sea level. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles water in holes in trees or in bromeliad plants high off the ground. ==Danger== Scientists believe this frog is not danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. But it is in some danger because people kill trees, for example to make charcoal: People set the forest on fire so they can sell the char for fuel. Scientists think people might also catch this frog to sell. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Reserva Nacional Allpahuayo Mishana. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
