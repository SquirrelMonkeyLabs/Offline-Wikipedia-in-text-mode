 "text": "Under the Southern Cross I Stand is the victory song of the Australia national cricket team. ==Lyrics== The song's lyrics are: Under the Southern Cross I stand, A sprig of wattle in my hand, A native of my native land, Australia, you fucking beauty! Because the word \"fuck\" is a swear word, if the team sings the song on the pitch, the word is replaced with \"little\" or \"bloody\".Cricket Australia FAQ ==References== Category:Australian patriotic songs Category:Cricket in Australia Category:Cricket music",
