Although not a bestseller or anything really great, What Are You Waiting For? did manage to sell around 60,000 copies in three and a half years. Remember, FM Static are only a side project. # Three days later - 2:23 # Crazy mary - 2:51 # Something to believe in - 2:48 # Definitely maybe - 2:49 # Donna - 2:27 # All the days - 2:26 # Hold me twice - 2:44 # The notion - 2:11 # October - 2:50 # My first stereo -2:53 # Hey now (hidden song) -3:08 Category:Pop punk albums Category:2003 albums",
