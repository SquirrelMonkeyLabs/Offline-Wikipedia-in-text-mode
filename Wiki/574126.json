 "text": "The Iron Act was a law created by Great Britain in 1750 making American colonies import more iron from Great Britain instead of refining it on their own. == What the Act did == * America can no longer export pig iron or bar iron. * All exports of metal can only be shipped to Great Britainâ€™s docks. * No mills may be created in America. All mills already there must be certified. == Implications == The act was officially repealed in 1867. Maryland and Virginia were the only colonies majorly affected. The act essentially stopped all creation of edged tools, nails, and tinplates. Great Britain had a history of creating acts designed to create more trade to England. Some people say that it was one of the Intolerable Acts that led to the American Revolution. == References == Category:Iron",
