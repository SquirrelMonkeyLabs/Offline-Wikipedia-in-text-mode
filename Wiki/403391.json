The palace had electricity and telephones even before the White House had them. ===Executive Building=== After Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the new government of Hawaii took over Iolani Palace. The palace was renamed the \"Executive Building\" for the Republic of Hawaii. Officials made a record of what was in the building. The things that could not be used by the new government were sold at public auctions. Queen Liliuokalani was imprisoned for nine months in a small room on the upper floor after a rebellion in 1895. The quilt she made is still there. ===Palace Restoration=== In 1930, the inside of Iolani Palace was remodeled. The wood framing was replaced by steel and reinforced concrete.
