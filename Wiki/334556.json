 "text": "There are many different breeds of ponies. A baby horse or pony is generally called a foal (a colt if male or a filly if female). These horses are raised around farms like other horses. Ponies are usually more chubby than horses and ponies have shorter legs. Miniature horses are not ponies but are actually mini horses because they have the features of a horse (i.e. longer legs and they are not as chubby as ponies). Shetland ponies are around the same height or slightly bigger than miniature horses but are ponies, not miniature horses. == Pony breeds == These are some well-known pony breeds: * Connemara Pony * Chincoteague Pony * New Forest Pony * Pony of the Americas * Welsh Pony * Shetland Ponies * Dartmoor Pony Category:Horses Category:Animals used for transport",
