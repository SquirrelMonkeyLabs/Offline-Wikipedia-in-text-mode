Although born in Michigan, Eddie grew up in the Lachute- Brownsburg, Quebec area where his parents lived until they moved to Red Deer, Alberta in 1913. Eddie moved to Port Arthur, Ontario in 1909 to work for the Canadian Northern Railway. He played the defensive position of cover point with the semi-professional Thunder Bay Hockey Club in 1910, then during the hockey seasons of 1910-11 & 1911-12 for the Port Arthur Hockey Club. The team (which included Jack Walker) defeated Prince Albert for the Western Canadian championship, then went on to play the Ottawa Senators on March 16, 1911 for the Stanley Cup; they were defeated by the NHA team. He played with the Moncton Victorias in the 1912-13 season and the New Glasgow Black Foxes in 1913-14. He won a Stanley Cup with the 1917 Seattle Metropolitans. After retiring from professional hockey in 1921, Eddie became the trainer, coach and manager for the Port Arthur Hockey Club which won two Allan Cups in 1924-25 and 1925-26. He served as councilor of the city of Port Arthur in 1941. About 1945, he moved to Winnipeg, and in approximately 1954 he retired from his job as a locomotive engineer, having worked for the Canadian National Railways. ==Career statistics== National Hockey League - Regular Season * Note: GP = Games played, G = Goals, A = Assists, PTS = Points, PIM = Penalties In Minutes YEAR TEAM GP G A PTS PIM 1919–20 Quebec Bulldogs 24 8 3 11 19 1920–21 Hamilton Tigers 20 2 1 3 4 NHL Regular Season Totals 44 10 4 14 23 ==References== * \"Everard Lorne (Eddie) Carpenter\", in F.B.
