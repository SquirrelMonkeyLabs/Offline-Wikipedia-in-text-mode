 "text": "The Sámi languages are a branch of Uralic languages spoken by the Sámi people. They are spoken in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. They are Uralic languages like Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian. They are sometimes considered dialects of the same language, but people from different dialects mostly do not understand one another. They share many things with the Baltic-Finnic languages such as Finnish, Estonian and Karelian but are not closely related to any of them. Their grammars are similar that of Finnish, but their syntax has undergone influence from the Scandinavian languages.https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sami-language#ref28791 Accessed 2017-08-25 Some linguists have a theory that the Sámi languages have come from a Proto-Sámi language, which existed c. 500 BC.https://www.sagat.no/debatt/hva-er-samenes-eldre-historie/19.43546.
