 "text": "A secret society is an organisation run in secrecy. There would be little or no physical evidence to prove that the society exists. An example of a large secret society is the Illuminati, which stopped existing in 1785 but is believed by some to still exist and be in control of large businesses, banks and individuals, but there is no evidence of this.",
