 "text": "Mandu (만두; 饅頭) are Korean-style dumplings from Korea. Mandu were introduced in Korea in the middle of the Joseon dynasty. They are made from flour stuffed with meat and vegetables. This filling is called so (소). Pork is the most common meat for so, but beef, chicken, or pheasant can also be ingredients of mandu. Vegetables are typically carrots, cucumbers, onions, and bean sprouts. Other additional ingredients are kimchi, tofu, or chopped noodles made from sweet potatoes. They can be fried, boiled, steamed or even baked, and each type has a different name. Mandu are usually served with soy sauce mixed with vinegar for dipping. They were traditionally made only in the early winter or for a holiday. However, in modern times, they are an everyday food. == References == * http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=59581 Category:Korean food",
