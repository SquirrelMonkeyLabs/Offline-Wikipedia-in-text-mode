 "text": "A unit vector is any vector that is one unit in length. Unit vectors are often notated the same way as normal vectors, but with a mark called a circumflex over the letter (e.g. \\mathbf{\\hat{v}} is the unit vector of \\mathbf{v}.) To make a vector into a unit vector, one just needs to divide it by its length: \\hat{\\mathbf{v}} = \\mathbf{v} / \\lVert \\mathbf{v} \\rVert. The resulting unit vector will be in the same direction as the original vector. == Standard basis vectors == Three common unit vectors are \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} and \\mathbf{\\hat{k}}, referring to the three-dimensional unit vectors for the x-, y- and z-axes, respectively. These vectors are called the standard basis vectors of a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. They are commonly just notated as i, j and k. They can be written as follows: \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}, \\,\\, \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}, \\,\\, \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} For the i-th standard basis vector of a vector space, the symbol e_i (or \\hat{e}_i) may be used. This refers to the vector with 1 in the i-th component, and 0 elsewhere. == Related pages == * Euclidean vector == References == Category:Linear algebra Category:Vectors",
