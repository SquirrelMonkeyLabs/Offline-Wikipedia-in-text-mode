Evanston, Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glenview, Morton Grove, Golf, Niles, Skokie, Glencoe, Highland Park, Lake Forest, and Lake Bluff are thought to be the main members of the North Shore, as all are affluent communities that border the lake just north of Chicago. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Chicago",
