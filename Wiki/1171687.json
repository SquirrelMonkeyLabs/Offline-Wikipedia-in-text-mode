 "text": "Nation of Islam (NOI) is a Black nationalist religious movement founded in 1930, * * * which played a considerable role in the Civil Rights Movement (1954‒68) in the United States (US). Since its founding, it has been a subject of controversy due to its promotion of ideas commonly seen as racist. * * * * * * * * * * ==Antisemitism== A common form of racism for which the NOI has been criticized is antisemitism. IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. Several figureheads of the NOI, including Elijah Muhammad, * Evanzz, Karl, The Judas Factor, The Plot to Kill Malcolm X, pp. 205–206, Thunder's Mouth Press, NY, 1992; Marable, Manning, Along the Color Line , reprinted in the Columbus Free Press, January 17, 1997. * Rolinson, Mary, Grassroots Garveyism, p. 193, UNC Press Books, 2007. * Washington Post, May 6, 1967, p. E-15, July 2, 1967, January 30, 1975, p. B7; Hakim Jamal, From the Dead Level, pp. 247–48; Louis Lomax To Kill a Black Man, pp. 108–09; Karl Evanzz, The Judas Factor, pp. 284–86, The Messenger, p. 303. * \"The Messenger Passes\", Time, March 10, 1975. Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, expressed antisemitic views within their lifetime. ===Elijah Muhammad=== In the 1960s, Elijah Muhammad, as the leader of the NOI, partnered with Neo-Nazi groups due to their mutual support for racial separatism. Muhammad worked with the KKK to buy farmland in the Deep South with a view to building Black-only colonies, one of which was founded as the Temple Farms, now Muhammad Farms, in Terrel County, Georgia. In the following 10 years, Elijah received huge funding from White supremacist Texas oil baron H. L. Hunt, which was used by Elijah to build luxurious homes for his own family. George Lincoln Rockwell, American Nazi Party's founder, praised Elijah Muhammad as \"the Hitler of the Black man\". ===Malcolm X=== Malcolm X was an NOI member until March 8, 1964. Malcolm X had made a series of antisemitic speeches, which promoted the The Protocols of the Elders of Zion among Ivy League-based academics and Black Americans. He accused Jews of being \"bloodsuckers [...] perfecting the modern evil of neocolonialism\". He also engaged in Holocaust denial Distortion of the Holocaust refers, inter alia, to: by blaming Jews for having \"brought it upon themselves\", based on his distorted view of certain events. In 1961, he spoke at an NOI rally along with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi Party, who claimed that Black nationalism and White supremacy shared a common vision. ===Louis Farrakhan=== NOI's leader Louis Farrakhan is well-known for his antisemitic views, despite his and his group's denial. Many believed Farrakhan to have been involved in the assassination of Malcolm X because Malcolm X reportedly abandoned his racist views about those he considered White. In 2020, Louis Farrakhan was classified by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as \"the most popular antisemite in America\". ====1980s==== In June 1984, Farrakhan went to Libya to visit her dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Upon return, Farrakhan smeared Judaism as a \"gutter religion [...] structured on injustice, thievery, lying and deceit\" that \"abused\" God's name for self- defense. In 1985, at an NOI meeting, Farrakhan said that the Jews deserved the Holocaust by screaming that \"And don't you forget, when it's God who puts you in the ovens, it's forever!\" ====1990s==== In 1995, Farrakhan accused Jews of causing the Holocaust themselves, a false claim common among antisemites, * * * * * * * * * * * by alleging that \"German Jews financed Hitler right here in America [...] International bankers financed Hitler and poor Jews died while big Jews were at the root of what you call the Holocaust\". In October, he mobilized 440,000 men to attend the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., the tenth-largest march in American history, when he called himself \"a prophet sent by God to show America its evil\". ====2020s==== Just as Malcolm X, Farrakhan is an iconic figure in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, appearing in graffitis painted by BLM activists. * * * * * ====Connections with White supremacists==== In September 1984, former KKK member Tom Metzger donated $100 to Farrakhan's NOI after being impressed by his antisemitic rhetoric at a Los Angeles event, * * * * * a prejudice shared by both White supremacists and Black supremacists. The donation was followed by Metzger's gathering of 200 White supremacists to pledge support for Farrakhan's NOI. ====Influence==== Along with Farrakhan's former allies Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, James Baldwin * * * * * etc., Farrakhan is one of the pro-Soviet Black supremacists who mainstreamed Soviet antisemitic tropes in American society via circulation among academics and Black Americans. In American society, Soviet antisemitic tropes were normalized over the decades and engendered a form of new antisemitism, * * * * * where Jews are accused of being the \"beneficiaries\" of \"White privilege\" and \"embodiment of evil\" allegedly coordinating Western governments to \"support Israel at the expense of Palestinians\". * * * * * ==Similar movements== ===Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI)=== A similar, and equally influential, movement is the Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI). * * * * * The BHI is founded on the pseudoscientific belief that African Americans are the \"real descendants\" of ancient Israelites. Some factions of the movement also see Native and Latino Americans as the descendants of ancient Israelites. From the 1970s onwards, followers of the BHI have a history of committing terrorist attacks on American Jews, including but not limited to the 2019 Jersey City shooting (7 dead and 3 injured) and the Monsey Hanukkah stabbing (1 dead and 4 injured). * * * * * While differing in theology, the BHI and NOI are both antisemitic. Particularly, they both believe that \"Jews ran the Atlantic slave trade\" and \"European Jews descended from the Khazars\". ====BHI and NOI: common beliefs about Jews==== In an article, historian Eunice G. Pollack outlined the beliefs about Jews held by both the BHI and NOI: * Judaism is a \"dirty religion\" * All Jews are \"imposter Jews\" * Jews \"ran the Atlantic slave trade\" * European Jews \"descended from the Khazars\" * Black Americans are the \"real Jews\", who \"cannot be antisemitic\" towards \"themselves\" no matter what they think about Jews ====BHI and NOI: differences in beliefs about Jews==== Name Beliefs Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) * Jesus was \"Black rather than Jewish\" * Black people are the \"real chosen people\" * Judaism was \"invented by KenitesDescendants of Cain. 2,000 years ago\" * Jews \"infiltrated the Levite tribe\" to \"rewrite the Torah\" and \"create pagan converts\" * Jews \"stole the identity of the BHI to serve Satan\" Nation of Islam (NOI) * Jews are the \"servants of Satan\" * Islam is the \"real Judaism\" * Jews \"originated from Europe 4,000 years ago\" * Jews \"changed the Torah\" to \"justify the enslavement of Black people\" ===New Black Panther Party (NBPP)=== The New Black Panther Party (NBPP), a Black nationalist successor to the Black Panther Party (BPP), is also known for sharing similar ideas as the NOI. Before a 2006 Democratic primary runoff in Georgia, the NBPP made an antisemitic public speech: When the NBPP-backed candidate Cynthia McKinney lost to her rival Hank Johnson, NBPP's members claimed that it was caused by \"Jewish electoral domination\". ==References== Category:Cults Category:Islam Category:Racism Category:Islamism Category:Neo- Nazism Category:Antisemitism Category:New religious movements Category:Organizations based in Chicago Category:1930 establishments in the United States Category:Islamic organizations based in the United States",
