 "text": "A bunkhouse is a simple building, often with only one or two rooms for lodging relatively large numbers of people, usually sleeping in cots or bunk beds lined up in rows. Bunkhouses are frequently used in camp settings like military bases, labour camps, certain remote ranches, children's summer camps, and hostels. Each room in a bunkhouse sleeps at least four people.
