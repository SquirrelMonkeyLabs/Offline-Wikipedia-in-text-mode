 "text": "The first round of the presidential elections was held in Colombia on 29 May 2022 to elect the 34th President. Since no candidate won a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round of voting will be held on 19 June. President Iván Duque cannot run for another term because Colombian presidents are term limited for a single four year term. Gustavo Petro won the runoff, becoming the first left-wing candidate to be elected president of Colombia. In the first round, left-wing Senator Gustavo Petro and right-wing populist former Bucaramanga mayor Rodolfo Hernández Suárez advanced to the run-off. Hernández Suárez, who came in third during voter pollings, came in second place against Federico Gutiérrez after an increase in support, weeks before the first round began. While Petro was seen as the front-runner in polls before the first round, he has almost been tied in pollings against Hernández Suárez. In the June run-off, Petro was elected president, winning 50% of the vote to Hernández Suárez's 47% of the vote, becoming the country's first leftist president. ==Candidates== Party/coalition Party/coalition Logo Presidential nominee Presidential nominee Most recent political office Vice- Presidential nominee Vice-Presidential nominee Fair and Free Colombia John Milton Rodríguez Senator of Colombia (2018–2022) Sandra de las Lajas Torres Historic Pact for Colombia Gustavo Petro Senator of Colombia (2018–present) Francia Márquez Hope Center Coalition Sergio Fajardo Governor of Antioquia (2012–2015) Luis Gilberto Murillo Independent Luis Pérez Governor of Antioquia (2016–2019) Ceferino Mosquera League of Anti-Corruption Governors Rodolfo Hernández Mayor of Bucaramanga (2016–2019) Marelene Castillo National Salvation Movement Enrique Gómez No prior public office Carlos Cuartes Oxygen Green Party Íngrid Betancourt Senator of Colombia (1998–2001) José Luis Esparza Team for Colombia Federico Gutiérrez Mayor of Medellín (2016–2019) Rodrigo Lara ==Polling== ===Second round=== Polling organisation/client Dates conducted Sample size Gustavo Petro Rodolfo Hernández Blank No vote Unsure/No answer Margin of Error Polling organisation/client Dates conducted Sample size Blank No vote Unsure/No answer Margin of Error La Silla Vacía 11 June 2022 N/A 47.2% 46.5% 5.4% 0.9% – – AtlasIntel 8–11 June 2022 4,467 47.5% 50.2% 2.4% – – 1% YanHaas 5–10 June 2022 1,234 45% 35% 13% – 7% 3.2% GAD3 30 May–10 June 2022 5,236 47.1% 47.9% 5% – – 1.4% Guarumo 6–9 June 2022 2,029 46.5% 48.2% 5.3% – – 2.5% GAD3 30 May–9 June 2022 4,834 48.1% 46.8% 5.1% – – 1.3% Mosqueteros 7–8 June 2022 6,000 43.83% 44.68% 3.54% – 7.95% 1.27% GAD3 30 May–8 June 2022 4,438 48.5% 46.7% 4.9% – – 1.5% Invamer 3–7 June 2022 1,329 47.2% 48.2% 4.7% – – 2.69% GAD3 30 May–7 June 2022 4,041 47.8% 47.1% 5.1% – – 1.6% GAD3 30 May–6 June 2022 3,240 46.8% 47.8% 5.4% – – 1.7% GAD3 30 May–4 June 2022 3,240 46.8% 48.1% 5.1% – – 1.3% Guarumo 1–4 June 2022 1,958 43.3% 46.4% 8.4% – 1.9% 2.5% YanHaas 30 May–3 June 2022 1,234 42% 41% 13% – 5% 3.2% GAD3 30 May–3 June 2022 2,840 46.3% 47.9% 5.8% – – 1.9% CNC 31 May–2 June 2022 2,172 44.9% 41% 3% 1.7% 9.4% 2.1% GAD3 2 June 2022 553 45.6% 50.4% 4% – – 2.1% GAD3 1 June 2022 555 45.1% 52.3% 2.6% – – 2.4% GAD3 30–31 May 2022 1,199 44.8% 52.5% 2.7% – – 2.9% CNC 30–31 May 2022 1,200 39% 41% 5% 1% 14% 2.8% AtlasIntel 17–20 May 2022 2,781 39.8% 48.2% – – – 2% Guarumo 16–19 May 2022 2,258 45.2% 41.5% 8.6% – 4.7% 2.5% CNC 13–19 May 2022 4,412 40.5% 40.5% 3.7% 9.3% 6% 1.5% Mosqueteros 15–18 May 2022 6,000 45.3% 35% 19.7% – – 1.27% Invamer 13–18 May 2022 1,195 50.0% 47.4% 2.6% – – 2.83% YanHaas 30 Apr–7 May 2022 1,232 46% 31% – 23% – 3.2% Guarumo 25–29 Apr 2022 2,132 44.5% 37.1% 8.6% – 9.8% 2.5% Invamer 21–27 April 2022 1,243 56% 40.6% 3.4% – – 2.55 CNC 18–21 April 2022 4,599 44.1% 34.1% 4.9% 11.4% 5.5% 1.4% CNC 4–7 April 2022 1,965 40% 38% 4% 10% 8% 2.2% CNC 28–31 March 2022 4,206 42.6% 34.4% 4.5% 12.4% 4.1% 1.5% YanHaas 14–19 March 2022 1,236 41% 32% – 27% – 3.2% ===First round=== Polling organisation/client Date(s) conducted Sample size Gustavo Petro Federico Gutiérrez Rodolfo Hernández Sergio Fajardo Íngrid Betancourt John M.
