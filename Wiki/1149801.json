 "text": "\"Suzy Snowflake\" is a holiday-based ballad. It was written by Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett. The song was made famous in 1951 by Rosemary Clooney. The song refers to a snowflake named Suzy. The song never mentions any holiday. The lyrics celebrate the fun of winter. A short cartoon based on the song was made in 1953 by Centaur Productions. The cartoon is shown during the Christmas season almost every year on WGN-TV in Chicago. ==References== Category:Christmas songs",
