 "text": "Calvados is an alcoholic drink. It is made from distilling cider in Normandy, one of the oldest Provinces of France (created in 911). It got its name from the place called Calvados which is famous for making it (sometimes called 'le Pays d'Auge'). It is also made in the other places in Normandy including la Manche (Cotentin) and l'Orne (Domfront). == How Calvados is made == The way to make Calvados is to distil cider twice. The first time it is done, the result is a liquid containing 28% to 30% alcohol. The second time it is done, the amount of alcohol is increased to about 40%. Since 1942, the Calvados has its own Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC), which means it is from one place. The rules are: * The « Calvados Pays d’Auge » (25% of production): The Cidre needs to come from apples of the « Pays d'Auge ». Two rounds of distillation in a multi-pass still * The « Calvados » (74 % of production): The apples used for the cidre need to be from Normandy. * The « Calvados Domfrontais » (1% of production) : Base for the production are apples and pears from the region called « domfrontais », there is only one round of distillation in a still. == How Calvados is served == Calvados can be served either dry or with ice, as a cocktail, an aperitif, or as a digestif. It goes very well with cheese, chocolate, dessert or ice cream. Crepes can also be served with Calvados. Calvados can also be added to coffee. People usually do this at the end of dinner. == Other websites == * Apples, cider and Calvados in Pays d'Auge, Normandy (Multilingual)* * Ferme du Ponctey Normandy (Multilingual) * Category:Alcoholic spirits Category:Calvados Category:Apple products",
