 "text": "Tanjong Pagar MRT Station (EW15) is an underground Mass Rapid Transit station on the East West Line in Downtown Core, Singapore. The station caters to people, especially businessmen and residents, working and living in the Shenton Way and Robinson Road areas. Currently the station is surrounded by recent developments of Tanjong Pagar Centre, of which it is the tallest skyscraper in Singapore (290 metres). Permission is required by the authority and it is exempted from the height restrictions due to Paya Lebar Airbase. ==History== The station was first opened on 12 December 1987, as part of the extension of the system to Outram Park. The station was expanded in 2004 to facilitate disabled access and the new Exit I was later opened. Before the Tanjong Pagar Centre (Exit J) opens, there are several exits in the MRT station, all connected by the underpass: *A: Peck Seah Street *B: Maxwell Road *C: Anson Road *D: Prince Edward Road *E: AXA Tower (formerly Temasek Tower) *F: Robinson Road *G: Telok Ayer (Amoy Street Market) *H: Springleaf Street The faregates at this station were replaced in 12 October 2012 and the Exit I faregates were replaced on 20 August 2017. ==References== Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations",
