 "text": "Pontiac (c. 1720 – April 20, 1769) was a war chief. He became known for his role in Pontiac's War (1763–1766), an American Indian war against British military near the Great Lakes region and named for him. Historians today generally view him as an important local leader who influenced a wider movement that he did not command. The war began in May 1763 when Pontiac and 300 followers attempted to take Fort Detroit by surprise but their plan was foiled. He gained confidence as he continued to go against the British. British officials made Pontiac the focus of their diplomatic efforts seeking to end the war. Pontiac was killed on April 20, 1769. ==References== Category:1769 deaths Category:Native American people Category:Murdered Native American people",
