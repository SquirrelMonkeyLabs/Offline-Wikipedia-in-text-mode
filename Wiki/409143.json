() and the Patriotic War of 1812 in Russia (), was Napoleon I leading the French Empire to invade Russia. That was the turning point during the Napoleonic Wars, because it was the first major defeat for Napoleon. It greatly reduced the French and allied invasion forces (the Grande Armée). It started a major change in European politics by greatly weakened the French power over Europe. French allies, at first Prussia and then Austria, broke their alliance with France. They fought France instead, which started the War of the Sixth Coalition.Fierro; Palluel-Guillard; Tulard, p. 159-161 == References == == Other websites == * History of the Expedition to Russia Undertaken by the Emperor Napoleon in the Year 1812, by the count de Ségur (Gutenberg Project ebook) * Napoleon's Invasion of Russia 1812 + color maps * Alternative version of Minard's map (using modern country boundaries) * Alternative version of Minard's map (zoomed-out, to show area in relationship to the rest of Europe) * French invasion of 1812, view from Russia * Patriotic War of 1812, Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, 1-22 Category:1812 Category:Napoleonic Wars Category:Wars involving Russia",
