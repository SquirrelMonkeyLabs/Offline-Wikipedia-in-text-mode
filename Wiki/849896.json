 "text": "Rock n Roll is a song by singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne. This song is on her self titled album which was released in 2013. The song is a message to her fans that even though she is older now, that doesn't take away the fact that she's still the same rock chick she introduced herself as in 2002. This song has a similar feel to her other song titled \"Smile\" (which is on her \"Goodbye Lullaby\" album, released in 2011). They both express how the young lady still has some edge to her despite the changing times. In the \"Rock n Roll\" music video, Avril plays a bisexual character and at one point in the video, she kisses her partner on the lips before she gets in a car crash. The music video really adds to the idea that this song is about simply not giving a flip and just having fun with your life. Category:Avril Lavigne songs",
