Ruanda-Urundi formed part of German East Africa until it was captured by Belgian forces during World War I. After that, the territory became a League of Nations mandate, and later a United Nations trust territory, under Belgian control, until 1962 when the constituent parts of the territory became independent. For residents of the subregion of Ruanda, see List of colonial residents of Rwanda. For residents of the subregion of Urundi, see List of colonial residents of Burundi. ==list== Portrait Name Position Term of office Took office Name Position Left office Hans von Ramsay Commander May 1896 189?
