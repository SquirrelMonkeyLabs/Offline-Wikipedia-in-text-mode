 "text": "The Forth and Clyde Canal opened in 1790. It is is 35 miles (56 km) long. It provided a route for boats to go between Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth to Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde at the narrowest part of the Scottish Lowlands. As the boats grew bigger and the railways were developed it was slowly abandoned. In 1967 the part through Grangemouth was drained and filled in. In 2000 the Falkirk Wheel was built to connect it again to the Union Canal. == References == Category:Canals in Scotland",
