 "text": "The doorway effect is a unusual occurrence that happens in the brain. This effect usually happens due to short-term memory loss while going through a door. Humans tend to forget recent information once crossing a boundary and often forget what they are thinking or planning to do after entering a different room. Research says that this happens in both real life boundaries (ex: moving into a different room using a door) and imaginary/virtual boundaries (ex: switching desktop windows using the Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut on Windows or the Cmd+Tab keyboard shortcut on MacOS). == References == Category:Memory",
