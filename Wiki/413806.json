In the United States and in Canada a condominium is a collection of apartment units, townhouses, garden homes or single homes that share common property together. In British Columbia condominiums are referred to as stratas. By owning a unit in a condominium, a person has access to the common facilities. The shared use of these facilities is legally guaranteed as part of the property; they share ownership of these areas. Such facilities may include hallways, a heating system, elevators, gardens, and recreational facilities. ==Other websites== Category:Housing law",
