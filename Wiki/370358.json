She directed it with Monty Montgomery. The story was about a bicycle rider played by Willem Dafoe. Bigelow did not want it to follow a traditional plot-line. The movie was, in some ways, against mainstream Hollywood.Lane, Christina. “From ‘The Loveless to Point Break’: Kathryn Bigelow’s Trajectory in Action.” Cinema Journal 37, no. 4 (1998): 59–81. https://doi.org/10.2307/1225727.Buckland, Warren. Film Studies: An Introduction: Teach Yourself. United Kingdom: John Murray Press, 2015. Bigelow went on to direct Near Dark (1987). The movie was Bigelow's first as a single director. Three actors were also in Aliens (1986), which James Cameron directed. The movie did not make that much money but got positive reviews from critics. Like The Loveless, Bigelow also broke tradition and experimented with genre. The movie is a mixture of western and vampire genres. In 1988, The Museum of Modern Art highlighted the new movie in its Cineprobe program. Near Dark is considered the first movie, in which Bigelow showed a unique and notable style as filmmaker.Abbott, Stacey. Near Dark. United Kingdom: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2020., p. 1-2. The next movie Bigelow directed was Blue Steel (1990). The movie was an action genre but also had elements of a fantasy movie and plays with genre.The Cinema of Kathryn Bigelow: Hollywood Transgressor. United Kingdom: Wallflower Press, 2003., p. 53. In the movie, Jamie Lee Curtis stars as a police officer whom a serial killer stalks. Like Near Dark, Eric Red co-wrote the screenplay. Blue Steel is similar to The Silence of the Lambs (1991). In both, women detectives are the main characters.MIZEJEWSKI, LINDA. “PICTURING THE FEMALE DICK: THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS AND BLUE STEEL.” Journal of Film and Video 45, no. 2/3 (1993): 6–23. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20688003. Some critics said the movie was empowering for women.Grant, Barry Keith. 2019. Film genre: from iconography to ideology. [Place of publication not identified]: Wallflower Press. https://rbdigital.rbdigital.com , p. 88. Point Break (1991) followed Blue Steel. The movie starred Keanu Reeves as an FBI agent. The movie made a lot more money than Bigelow's previous movies. It got about $80 million profit. However, it had somewhat lower ratings. Critics thought the movie was simply an action movie and was just gut emotions.Clark, Mike (July 12, 1991). \"Point Break is a dramatic wipeout\". USA Today.
