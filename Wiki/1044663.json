 "text": "Erlkönig is a work by Franz Schubert. He composed in 1815, and published in 1821. Schubert set the ballad of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with the same name into music. Originally, the score was for a singing voice, accompanied by piano. Today, four different versions by Schubert are known.The original is set in G minor. When it was published, the work was an immediate success.The singing voice has been transposed so that the part can be sung by different voices. As Schubert used music, he was able to express more feelings than the ballad alone. Among the feelings expressed are fear, desire, excitement. threat, and security. There are arrangements: Franz Liszt wrote a version for solo piano, Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst one for solo violin. Hector Berlioz wrote a version for orchestra and voice. Liszt later also wrote a version for orchestra, as did Max Reger. Category:Classical music",
