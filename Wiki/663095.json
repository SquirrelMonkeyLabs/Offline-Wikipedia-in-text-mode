Previously, Dahab was the Minister of Defense under President Gaafar Nimeiry from March to April 1985. Dahab led a successful coup d'état against President Nimeiry on 6 April 1985 due to his failures to stop the Second Sudanese Civil War. In 1986, Dahab called for elections to elect a civilian government. Ahmed al-Mirghani was elected as President and Sadiq al-Mahdi as Prime Minister. Dahab officially handed over power to the elected civilian government on 6 May 1986. After his presidency, Dahab moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where he died on 18 October 2018, at the age of 84. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Presidents of Sudan",
