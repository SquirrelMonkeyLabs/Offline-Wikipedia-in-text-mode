 "text": "The 7 July Memorial is a permanent memorial to the 52 victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. It is on the east side of Hyde Park, by Lover's Walk and Park Lane, close to Curzon Gate and about north of the well-known statue of Achilles. ==Vandalism== The memorial had graffiti put on two weeks after its creation ceremony in 2009, with words written on the memorial with a black marker pen. It was graffitied on for a second time in 2014, being found on the morning of the ninth anniversary of the attacks. In the 2014 incident slogans such as \"4Innocent Muslims\", \"Blair Lied Thousands Died\" and \"J7 Truth\" were written in red and black marker on the memorial, and were removed shortly after being discovered by the park's manager. ==References== Category:2009 establishments in England Category:Monuments and memorials in England Category:July 2005 London bombings Category:Buildings and structures in the City of Westminster",
