It was made as a British Formula One engine maker. The company name was taken from the last names of the founders. It originally started building engines for IndyCars. They received money from IndyCar team owner and builder Roger Penske to do this. The Daimler-Benz company purchased General Motors' 25% share of Ilmor in 1993.

In Ilmor also supplied the new Pacific GP team of Keith Wiggins with the old 1993 version of the engines. Pacific only managed to qualify seven times in thirty-two tries. The Ilmor engine was not the cause of this poor performance. Ilmor became the engine partner to McLaren in . The partnership received its first win at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix.

After not winning a single race in the season, McLaren bounced back and won the driver's championship in season with Lewis Hamilton.
