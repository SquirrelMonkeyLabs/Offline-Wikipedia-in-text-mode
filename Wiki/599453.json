 "text": "The University of Texas tower shooting was a school shooting in the United States. It happened on August 1, 1966. It took place in Austin, Texas at University of Texas at Austin. Sixteen people were killed in the incident. A 17th victim succumbed to his injuries in 2001. Charles Whitman was the mass murderer. It has been suggested that Whitman's violent impulses, with which he struggled for years, were caused by a tumor on his brain. Whitman had killed his wife and his mother hours earlier. After the shootings, the observation deck was closed. The many bullet holes were repaired. The tower was closed again in 1975 after four suicides. It reopened in 1999 after security features were put up. ==References== Category:1966 in the United States Category:1960s crimes in the United States Category:1960s in Texas Category:Disasters in Texas Category:History of Austin, Texas Category:Mass murder in Texas Category:Massacres in the United States Category:Murder in the 1960s Category:Murders by firearm in the United States Category:University and college shootings in the United States",
