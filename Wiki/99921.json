It is not clear whether it is only a clump of dust, or if there is a solid small moon at its core. It was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004, and announced on 8 November that year.IAUC 8432: Satellites and Rings of Saturn 2004 November 8 (claiming recovery of on 17 October, 2004, in conflict with the later (2006) Spitale et al.) It appears to be the best tracked object in this area with at least five possible sightings in the period till late 2005. In comparison, two objects in the F ring's area ( and ) that were first seen months earlier have not been found again. An imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November 2004, soon after it was discovered did not find the object, while it has been seen again later. The lighting conditions in 's part of the orbit were different during these two sightings. The discovery was made when the area was strongly backlit by the sun. 's visibility may be primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small. has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. Calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April, 2005. It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the thinnest material around the F ring may have been a result of this. The dusty halo seen in pictures is big, being around 2000 km in length. The solid object, if any, would be no bigger than 3−5 km in diameter based on brightness. ==References== Category:Saturn's moons",
