 "text": "Brookdale Library is a Public library in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. The current library building opened in 1981. The library shares with the county courthouse, licensing and records services office, and a social service and community corrections offices. Plants in the library were taken from the nearby Shingle Creek. == Building expansion == The library was the first one built for further expansions. This extension started in 2002 and took 18 months. The library almost doubled in size. The updates included 144 computers, a cyber caf√©-styled teen zone, and space for an additional 50,000 books (making the collection about 150,000). Dedicated spaces were built for quiet study, meeting rooms, and a conference room. == Previous libraries == The library was first served by a bookmobile and a drop-off point inside of a store. A library was built by the city council in 1965. They named the library \"Brooklyn Center Library\". This library was not part of Hennepin county library. In 1969, a deal was made with Hennepin County Library to build a new library in the area. Hennepin County Library demolished the library. The current new library was built in 1981. The Girl Scout Council of Greater Minneapolis also declared the library as its Headquarters. == References == Category:Coordinates on Wikidata Category:Pages using gadget WikiMiniAtlas Category:Infobox mapframe without OSM relation ID on Wikidata Category:Education in the United States Category:1981 establishments in the United States Category:Libraries in Hennepin County Library",
