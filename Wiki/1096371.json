 "text": "Corey R. Lewandowski (; born September 18, 1973) is an American political operative, lobbyist, political commentator and author. He is known for being supportive of Donald Trump. He was the first campaign manager of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was fired by Trump during the Republican Primary. He later became a political commentator for One America News Network (OANN), Fox News and CNN. Lewandowski was seen as a possible candidate to run against New Hampshire Democratic U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen in the 2020 election. However, he decided not to run in early 2020 and said that he \"would have won\" had he run. In September 2021 it was reported that his relationship with Trump had ended when he had made sexual advances towards the wife of a major Trump donor. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:American political commentators Category:American lobbyists Category:American political writers Category:Businesspeople from Massachusetts Category:Writers from Massachusetts Category:Politicians from Massachusetts Category:People from Lowell, Massachusetts Category:Businesspeople from New Hampshire Category:Writers from New Hampshire Category:Politicians from New Hampshire Category:Republicans (United States) Category:Fox News people Category:CNN people",
