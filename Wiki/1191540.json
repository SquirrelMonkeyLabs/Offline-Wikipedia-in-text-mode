 "text": "Leon Rupnik (1880‒1946) was a Slovenian Catholic Nazi collaborator * * * who helped Nazi Germany carry out the Holocaust in occupied Slovenia, then known as the Province of Ljubljana. 90% of Slovenia's Jews were killed when Rupnik was the president of the Province of Ljubljana, supported by Bishop Gregorij Rožman. Under Rupnik, the Slovene Home Guard helped the Germans deport Jews to death camps. Only 67 Slovenian Jews survived. After the war, Rupnik was convicted of treason, and executed on September 2, 1946. ==Early life== Leon Rupnik was born on August 10, 1880 in the village of Lokve in present-day Slovenia. ==Early career== ===World War I=== Rupnik became a major in the Austro-Hungarian army after training at the General Staff Academy in Vienna. He saw action in the Austrian-occupied Serbian frontlines in World War I. ===Kingdom of Yugoslavia=== Initially a major in the Royal Yugoslav Army, Rupnik rose through the ranks to become a divisional general in 1937, and built part of the Rupnik Line along Yugoslavia's border with Italy and Austria. ==World War II== When the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in April 1941, he quickly ordered the 4th and 7th Armies to retreat from the frontlines. After the Axis powers broke up Yugoslavia, Ustaše's leader Ante Pavelić, who set up the pro-Nazi Independent State of Croatia, ordered Rupnik to leave Zagreb. He moved to Italian-occupied Ljubljana. ===The Province of Ljubljana=== ====Italian-Hungarian occupation==== Rupnik became the mayor of Ljubljana in June 1942. He worked well with the Italian occupiers, mobilized locals to support fascism and fight for the Axis powers. Meanwhile, the Italians banned Slovenian from being spoken in public, schools and churches. Likewise, the Hungarian occupiers forced Slovenian kids to join paramilitary groups, and men to join their army. Resisters were sent to the Szarvar concentration camp. ====Nazi occupation==== In September 1943, the Germans took over Ljubljana after the Italians surrendered to the Allies. On September 20, Rupnik became the president of the Province of Ljubljana, hoping for the formation of a Slovenian protectorate. However, the Nazi Germans planned to eliminate the Slovenian identity, deport of Slovenes, replace them with German settlers and turn the remaining Slovenes into Germans.T. Ferenc, Okupacija slovenskega ozemlja [The Occupation of Slovenian Territory], in Slovenska novejša zgodovina 1848 – 1992 ed. J. Fischer (Ljubljana: Institute of Contemporary History, 2005), 581-601. On September 30, Rupnik, as the Chief Inspector, gave the Slovene Home Guard this order: ====Secret police==== Rupnik set up secret police forces, one called the Information Bureau to monitor his fellow Slovenes, the other called the Black Hand, whose members killed and tortured innocent locals. Some Catholic chaplains betrayed their townsmen to the secret police, which resulted in arrests, torture and hostage shootings. As said by one of them, they considered it a holy duty:F. Saje, Belogardizem, 2008, 126 ==Antisemitism== Rupnik was a notorious antisemite who loved Hitler and Nazism, while his views aligned with a form of Catholic fascism popular back then. He encouraged Slovenes to turn in resistance fighters to Nazi troops, and forced locals to attend pro-Nazi rallies. Gregorij Rožman, the pro-Nazi Bishop of Ljubljana, praised Rupnik as \"the most capable man for this administrative position\". ===Antisemitic speeches=== In a 1944 lecture, entitled \"Bolshevism: a tool of international Judaism\" and subtitled \"Jewish endeavours towards global supremacy\", Rupnik said: In another lecture on June 5, 1944, Rupnik said: ===Oaths of allegiance to Nazi Germany=== On April 20, 1944 (Hitler's birthday), Rupnik, Bishop Rožman, and the Slovene Home Guard took the following oath:\"The Home guard has sworn fidelity to its homeland,\" Slovenec, no. 91(April 21st 1944): 2. At the ceremony where the Slovene Home Guard swore their oath of allegiance on January 30, 1945 (12th anniversary of the Nazi takeover of Germany), Rupnik said: ==Trial== The British handed over Rupnik, who disguised as a refugee, to the Yugoslav communists. They put him on trial in August 1946. He pleaded guilty to treason and war crimes, while denying that he did it in bad faith. He was sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad in Ljubljana on September 2, 1946. However, the conviction was cancelled in January 2020 by the Slovenian Supreme Court on \"procedural grounds\". * * * * * The cancellation was condemned by Jewish groups worldwide, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which noted: Ljubljana's Jewish Cultural Centre also condemned the cancellation: > [...] It is our assessment that we are witnessing the first step in a > politically motivated ambition to rehabilitate the criminal collaborationist > regime in Slovenia during WWII whose “president” was the aforementioned Leon > Rupnik, and who was justly tried and sentenced to death as a war criminal, > and whom even the pre-war Yugoslav Royal Government, then in exile, > renounced as a traitor. [...] ==Denial== For the past decade, there has been a revisionist movement in Slovenian society to whitewash Leon Rupnik. It is reportedly led by the Slovenian Democratic Party and The New Slovenia. These parties draw support from traditionalist Catholics. ===Leon Rupnik's grandson=== Leon Rupnik's grandson petitioned to challenge the 1946 conviction of his grandfather. His petition unexpectedly succeeded in January 2020, when the Slovenian Supreme Court cancelled the 1946 conviction on \"procedural grounds\". The cancellation was condemned by Jewish groups worldwide, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center. ===Slovenian Catholic Church=== The history of Slovenian‒Nazi collaboration has become a polarized topic in Slovenian society, with the pro- Rupnik side backed by the Slovenian Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, along with conservative parties and revisionist historians, often accused others of \"justifying totalitarian Communist dictatorship\" for rejecting Rupnik's antisemitic legacy. Apart from beatifying the pro-Ustaše Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac, the Catholic Church has tried rehabilitating Bishop Rožman, despite his antisemitism and Nazi collaboration. ===Beyond Slovenia=== A similar trend of Holocaust distortion, some state-sponsored, is also seen in other European countries, including Austria, Croatia, * * * Czechia, Hungary, * * * Germany, Italy and Poland. * Robert Rozett, “Competitive Victimhood and Holocaust Distortion,” The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, XVI (2022); “Distorting the Holocaust and Whitewashing History: Toward a Typology,” XIII: 1 (2019); Yehuda Bauer, “Creating a “Usable” Past: On Holocaust Denial and Distortion,” XIV: 2 (2022); and Jan Grabowski, “The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'” X: 3 (2016). * Joanna Beata Michlic, “The Politics of the Memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland: Reflections on the Current Misuses of the History of Rescue,” Jewish Historical Studies—Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England, LIII: 1 (2022); Piotr Forecki, Po Jedwabnem: Anatomia pamięci funkcjonalnej (Kraków, 2018); Jan Gross, Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne (Princeton, 2001). * Piotr Forecki, “Domestic ‘Assassins of Memory’: Various Faces of Holocaust Revisionism in Contemporary Poland,” presentation at a symposium in honor of Professor Antony Polonsky called “The Holocaust in Eastern Europe: sources, memory, politics,” March 16, 2021, UCL, London. * * Antony Polonsky and Joanna Beata Michlic (eds.), The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland (Princeton, 2009) and Laurence Weinbaum, “Amnesia and Antisemitism in the ‘Second Jagiellonian Age,’” Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and Delegitimizing Israel, Robert Wistrich (ed.)

Some described the phenomenon with the concept mnemonic politics, where nationalist governments distorted the Holocaust by framing their ethnic majority as the victims rather than the Jews or Roma.Kónczal, Kornelia, and Moses, A.

For instance, Boris Vasev, a journalist of the Slovenian state television Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTV Slovenija) promoted conspiracy theories about Jews, like \"the vaccination campaign exposes the essence of Israel's Apartheid regime\" and \"the policy of Jewish supremacy in Israel means that the government restricted vaccines to its Arab citizens\". Boris Vasev also reportedly praised the Hamas, and celebrated the 1972 Olympic games massacre. Writing for the Algemeiner, Anel Bisaki noted: Synagogues in Slovenia were frequently vandalized during the Gaza War. In January 2025, a medieval synagogue in Maribor, Slovenia was sprayed with \"Jews are the evil of the world\" and \"Death to Jews, glory to Slovenia.\" This happened at a time the Slovenian government had been accusing Israel of genocide, along with countries like South Africa * * * * * and Ireland, * * * whose government-approved textbooks misrepresented the Auschwitz concentration camp as a \"prisoner-of-war camp\" and Judaism as \"a violent religion\". * * * * * * ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Nazis Category:Catholics Category:Antisemitism Category:The Holocaust Category:War criminals Category:Slovenian people",
