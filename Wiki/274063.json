Born in Fort William, Ontario, Stewart was promoted from the minors in 1942 to play in one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where he helped the Toronto Maple Leafs win the championship.NHL.com, Former NHL player Gaye Stewart dies, November 19, 2010 The next season, Stewart won the 1943 Calder Trophy, beating out Maurice 'The Rocket' Richard of the Montreal Canadiens. He became the first player to win the Stanley Cup before the Calder. Danny Grant, Tony Esposito and Ken Dryden have accomplished it as well since then. After spending two years in the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II, Stewart returned to the NHL in 1945 and had his best season, leading the league with 37 goals - the last time a Leaf led the League in scoring. Stewart won his second Stanley Cup, again with the Maple Leafs, in 1947. Toronto traded Stewart to Chicago early in the 1947-48 season in a deal that brought Max Bentley to the Leafs, and he had three 20-goal seasons for the Black Hawks before finishing his career with stints in Detroit, New York and Montreal. In all, Gaye Stewart played for five of the NHL's Original Six teams, all except the Boston Bruins. He played 502 career NHL games, scoring 185 goals and 159 assists for 344 points. Stewart died on November 18, 2010, in a hospital in Burlington, Ontario, at the age of 87. ==Career statistics== Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1941-42 Hershey Bears AHL 5 4 2 6 0 1941-42 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL -- -- -- -- -- 1 0 0 0 0 1942-43 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 48 24 23 47 30 4 0 2 2 4 1945-46 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 50 37 15 52 8 -- -- -- -- -- 1946-47 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 60 19 14 33 15 11 2 5 7 8 1947-48 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 7 1 0 1 9 -- -- -- -- -- 1947-48 Chicago Blackhawks NHL 54 26 29 55 74 -- -- -- -- -- 1948-49 Chicago Blackhawks NHL 54 20 18 38 57 -- -- -- -- -- 1949-50 Chicago Blackhawks NHL 70 24 19 43 43 -- -- -- -- -- 1950-51 Detroit Red Wings NHL 67 18 13 31 18 6 0 2 2 4 1951-52 New York Rangers NHL 69 15 25 40 22 -- -- -- -- -- 1952-53 New York Rangers NHL 18 1 2 3 8 -- -- -- -- -- 1952-53 Montreal Canadiens NHL 5 0 1 1 0 -- -- -- -- -- 1952-53 Quebec Aces QSHL 29 13 20 33 28 1953-54 Buffalo Bisons AHL 70 42 53 95 38 3 0 2 2 4 1953-54 Montreal Canadiens NHL -- -- -- -- -- 3 0 0 0 0 1954-55 Buffalo Bisons AHL 60 17 19 36 36 -- -- -- -- -- NHL totals 502 185 159 344 284 25 2 9 11 16 ==References== ==Other websites== * *Gaye Stewart Interview *Gaye Stewart's Day with the Stanley Cup *Gaye Stewart dies Category:1923 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Calder Trophy winners Category:Canadian ice hockey right wingers Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario Category:Chicago Blackhawks players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Montreal Canadiens players Category:New York Rangers players Category:Sportspeople from Thunder Bay Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:Ontario Hockey League players",
