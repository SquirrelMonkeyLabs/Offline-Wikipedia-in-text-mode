The league is the most popular sports competition in Australia. In 2017, more than 7.2 million people watched a game in a stadium. == The clubs == === National Competition === Since the 2012 season, there are nine clubs from Melbourne, one from Victoria's second largest city, Geelong, two teams from South Australia's capital of Adelaide, two from the Perth area in Western Australia, two from Queensland and two from Sydney, New South Wales. AFL is the dominant league in television, print and radio news in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania. Also Australian rules football has more people playing than any other football code in these states and territories. The AFL is becoming more popular in the states of New South Wales and Queensland. This happened after the finals wins by the Brisbane Lions (2001, 2002 and 2003) and Sydney Swans (2005). With the success of these sides, interest in Australian rules football has grown rapidly in these states in recent years. This directly led to new clubs being added in both states in the 2010sâ€”Gold Coast in 2011 and Greater Western Sydney in 2012. === Major annual awards === * Brownlow Medal * Coleman Medal * AFL Rising Star * Leigh Matthews Trophy * Norm Smith Medal * Jock McHale Medal * Michael Tuck Medal * AFL Mark of the Year * AFL Goal of the Year * All Australian Team * Club Best and Fairest Awards === Present teams === |- !
