 "text": "Cock Lane is a small street in Smithfield, London which runs east to Giltspur Street and west to Snow Hill. It was known as Cokkes Lane during the Middle Ages - when the lane was known for its legal brothels. However, it is most well known for the ghost that is said to be around the area since 1762. It is also known for being where Christian preacher and writer John Bunyan died of a fever in 1688. The junction between this lane and Giltspur Street marks an area known as Pye Corner which serves as a marker for the furthest reach of the Great Fire of London. A monument, the Golden Boy of Pye Corner, marks this location. ==References== Category:Roads in London",
