 "text": "Peter Benjamin Mandelson (born 21 October 1953) is a British politician for the Labour Party. He helped to found the so-called 'New Labour' with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. He was the Member of Parliament for Hartlepool from 1992-2004. Lord Mandelson lost his job twice, once in 1998 for not declaring a loan he was given to buy a house, and once in 2001 for trying to arrange a passport for an Indian businessman who had given £1,000,000 to the Labour Party. He later made a speech claiming to have \"inner steel\". After Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, he made Mandelson a Life Peer, and some newspapers have called him \"the most powerful man in the Labour Party\". Mandelson is gay (he was outed in 1998 by openly gay journalist Matthew Parris),BBC to replay clip of Mandelson being outed which led some to claim the UK was being run by a gay mafia. == References == == Other websites == * Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:European Commissioners Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for English constituencies Category:Gay men Category:British LGBT politicians Category:Politicians from London Category:UK MPs 1992–1997 Category:UK MPs 1997–2001 Category:UK MPs 2001–2005 Category:Labour Life Peers Category:Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland",
