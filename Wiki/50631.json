 "text": "Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon KG MC PC (12 June 1897–14 January 1977) was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was better known throughout his time in office as Sir Anthony Eden. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. Eden was one of the best-known politicians of his generation. He was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1935 by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and resigned in 1938 in protest at Chamberlain's appeasement of Adolf Hitler. He was Churchill's Foreign Secretary during World War II, and again in 19511955. He had an operation to remove gallstones in 1953. The operation went wrong, and his health was ruined. He became Prime Minister in 1955 when Winston Churchill retired. He resigned as Prime Minister in 1957, and Harold Macmillan replaced him. The Suez Crisis of 1956 was a critical period. This and his health led up to his resignation as Prime Minister. Eden died of liver cancer, aged 79. His widow, Clarissa Eden, Countess of Avon, was born in 1920 and died in 2021. She was a niece of Winston Churchill.Eden, Clarissa 2007. A memoir: from Churchill to Eden. Eden's life can be described in two halves. The first half, in the 1930s and in wartime, was brilliant.

Thorpe says the Suez Crisis \"was a truly tragic end to his premiership, and one that came to assume a disproportionate importance in any assessment of his career\".Thorpe D.R. 2003.

He served as Foreign Minister in Churchill's military government (1940—1945), was considered Churchill's successor, but distinguished himself primarily as Foreign Minister in the war. Leader of the House of Commons from 1942 to 1945. After Labor's election victory in July 1945, he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition. From 1951 to 1955 Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister. After Churchill's resignation in 1955, he was appointed prime minister. His premiership turned out to be short- lived and unsuccessful, both from a foreign policy point of view (the Suez crisis of 1956, which ended catastrophically for Great Britain), and from a domestic political point of view (he had to resign after mass protests by the population and cede leadership in the party to Macmillan). == References == Category:1897 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:British military personnel of World War I Category:British people of World War II Category:Cancer deaths in England Category:Deaths from prostate cancer Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom Category:English Anglicans Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs Category:Members of the British House of Commons for English constituencies Category:Leaders of the Conservative Party (UK) Category:Conservative members of the House of Lords Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from County Durham Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Secretaries of State of the United Kingdom Category:UK MPs 1929–1931 Category:UK MPs 1931–1935 Category:UK MPs 1935–1945 Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 Category:UK MPs 1955–1959 Category:United Kingdom Earls Category:World War II political leaders",
