It was suspended in 4 March 2020. It was filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission for the office of President of the United States as a member of the Democratic Party on November 21, 2019. His principal campaign committee was called \"Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc.\" The campaign officially launched on November 24, 2019. On March 5, 2019, Bloomberg announced that he would not run for president in 2020. As late as October 14, 2019, a day before the Democratic Party's fourth presidential debate, it was reported that Bloomberg was “still looking at” a bid due to the fall of Joe Biden's polling numbers. On November 7, 2019, Bloomberg announced that he was taking steps to enter the 2020 United States presidential election, and on November 8 he officially filed for the Alabama Democratic presidential primary. Bloomberg said that he would skip the early primary states in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina and focus on primaries on and after Super Tuesday. Bloomberg's total spending in the primary passed $500 million, making it the most money spent on a presidential primary campaign in American history. On Super Tuesday, Bloomberg won the American Samoa caucus which brought his first and only victory in his campaign. He ended his campaign the next day on March 4, 2020 and announced his support of Joe Biden. ==References== Bloomberg Category:Michael Bloomberg",
