 "text": "Rosie Jiménez (August 5, 1950 – October 3, 1977) is the first woman to have died in the United States from an unsafe abortion after a law called the Hyde Amendment was passed in 1977. The Hyde Amendment does not allow government money to be used for abortions. Jiménez could not afford to pay for a safe abortion. She died from an infection in McAllen, Texas after receiving the unsafe abortion. She was only 27 years old and was a student and a mother of a four year old daughter. == Legacy == The New York Times published an opinion article that said that Rosie Jiménez was the first death caused by the cutting of Medicaid funding for abortion. In honor of Rosie Jiménez the Abortion Access Project has organized Rosie Jiménez Day every October 3rd. == References == Category:1950 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Abortion in the United States",
