 "text": "Ilomska ( Иломска) is a river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is right tributary of the Ugar. It is about in length. The river starts in Vlašić's Mountain. It is an essential body of water for surrounding wildlife. Ilomska flows between the Žežnička Greda (altitude ) and Javorak () mountains. It has a curved flow around Lisina () and Runjavica () mountains, through coniferous (fir and spruce) and mixed spuce-beech woods. Its flow below Petrovo polje has sharp curves.Spahić M. et al.

After two attractive waterfalls, Ilomska flows into the Ugar, a few kilometers downstream from Vitovlje village. The height of the bigger water flow is around 40 meters. Waterfalls in this wildness attract mountain-climbers, tourists, and fishermen. ==References== Category:Rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina",
