 "text": "The 2018 United States elections were held Tuesday, November 6, 2018. These midterm elections happened during the presidency of Republican Donald Trump. Thirty-five of the 100 seats in the United States Senate and all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives were in the elections. Thirty-nine state and territorial governorships as well as many state and local elections were also in the elections. Democrats net gained of 41 seats in the United States House of Representatives, gaining a majority in the chamber. This ended the control that the Republican Party had over the entire legislature. The Republican Party kept control of the United States Senate, making a net gain of two seats and defeating four Democratic incumbents in states that had voted for Trump in 2016. In the state elections, Democrats gained seven state governorships, control of at least 350 state legislative seats, and control of six state legislative chambers. The elections had the highest voter turnout seen in midterm elections since 1914. This election was believed to be a \"blue wave\" election for the House and the states, but not the Senate. == Turnout == On November 6, the United States Election Project estimated that 40 million early voters cast ballots on November 6, breaking the record for the number of early votes. 50.3 percent of eligible voters voted in 2018. In 2014, only 36.7 percent of eligible voters voted. The 2018 elections had highest turnout of any mid-term election held since the 1914 elections. ==Results table== Subdivision and PVI Subdivision and PVI Before 2018 elections Before 2018 elections Before 2018 elections Before 2018 elections After 2018 elections After 2018 elections After 2018 elections After 2018 elections After 2018 elections Subdivision PVI Governor State leg.
