Germany's 7–1 win was the largest in FIFA World Cup semi-final history. To some, it became known as the Miracle of Rio de Janeiro. To others it was called the Mineirazo or \"Mineirazo\", comparing it with the famous \"Maracanazo\", in which Brazil lost an important game against Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup. == Background == The team met for the second time in World Cup history, with the first game being the 2002 FIFA World Cup final.
