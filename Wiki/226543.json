 "text": "The Parazoa are an ancestral subkingdom of animals, literally translated as \"beside the animals\". Parazoans differ from their choanoflagellate ancestors in that they are macroscopic and have differentiated cells, but unlike \"true animals\" (Eumetazoa), they do not have tissues. Most people put Placozoa in Parazoa, but Placozoa can also be placed in the subkingdom Agnotozoa. category:Groups of phyla",
