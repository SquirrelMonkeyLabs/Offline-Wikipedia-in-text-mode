 "text": "The Khaksar movement was a social movement based in the city of Lahore in the Punjab Province of British India. It was established by Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi in 1931, with the aim of freeing the Indian subcontinent from the rule of the British Empire. The Khaksars initially opposed the partition of India and favoured a united country. The membership of the Khaksar movement was open to everyone and had no membership fee regardless of the person's religion, race and caste or social status. The emphasis was on the brotherhood of mankind and being inclusive for all people. == References == Category:Political parties in Pakistan Category:Indian independence movement Category:Pakistan Movement Category:Partition of India Category:Political history of Pakistan",
