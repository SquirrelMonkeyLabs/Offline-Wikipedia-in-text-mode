 "text": "Electronic dance music, often simplified as EDM, (occasionally referred to as electronica or dance) is a form of electronic music which is meant to be danced to, often in the setting of a nightclub, discoth√®que or party. Generally, electronic dance music is created by producers and composers, and is then used by DJs, or disc jockeys, in the above settings. Electronic dance music takes many forms and styles. As a genre, it is generally up-tempo music created by electronic software and machines, such as synthesizers, drum machines, keyboards, samplers, sequencers and computers. Occasionally, the term \"techno\" is used to describe electronic dance music in general, despite being a generalisation as techno is a distinguishable subgenre of EDM. ==History and origins== Being quite a generic term, EDM has a variety of 'origins' and derivations. EDM can be said to stem from a fusion between regular dance music and electronic music. One notable example can be Donna Summer's 1977 single \"I Feel Love\", which combined elements of disco with electronic music. The innovative blend helped trigger several major EDM genres, such as Hi-NRG, Eurodance and techno music. Giorgio Moroder, who co- wrote the song and was also one of its producers, additionally created some of the earliest forms of electronic dance music. Kraftwerk are also credited as influencing electronic music. Whilst a lot of electronic dance music originates from disco, this is not the case for all EDM. The song which has been credited as bringing EDM into mainstream popular music is Madonna's 1998 single \"Ray of Light\". Whilst it is attributed as helping bring the genre mainstream, electronic dance music existed and had enjoyed popularity years before the single's release; house music, for instance, had been popular in the United States since the early 1990s (its popularity can also be attributed to another Madonna single, 1990's \"Vogue\"). ==Different forms of electronic dance music== There are different types of EDM, each varying in style, beats per minute and sound. This is a list of some of the major electronic dance music genres (each genre may additionally have further subgenres, which have not been looked at in too much detail for this section) * Italo disco - starting in the late 1970s, Italo disco is a form of EDM which came from disco music; whilst it kept a lot of disco's main characteristics, it made much stronger usage of synthesizers and drum machines in order to have a more futuristic sound. * Hi-NRG - starting in the late 1970s, Hi-NRG is a form of EDM which bases itself on disco music, with the exception that it is generally faster.
