 "text": "RB Leipzig (RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V.) is a German football club from Leipzig. ==History== The club was founded on 19 May 2009 by the Red Bull Company. It was formed out of the SSV Markranstädt. Due to the regulations of the DFB the name Red Bull Leipzig for marketing reasons was forbidden so they were called RB (short for RasenBallsport). Also the logo was forbidden. The company was sure that there is a great chance to form a new club, because with the Zentralstadion (now Red Bull Arena) there was a good stadium and there is no club in professional football in the area. The club is now in the Bundesliga. Like in Salzburg many fans protested against this deal because they had the fear that the fanculture will vanish and football will be only a business. So they wanted a \"normal\" football club. They started in the Oberliga Nordost-Süd(5th level) and became 1st in the 2009/10 season. But the next season they failed to gain promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. So the coach was changed, the new one is the Austrian Peter Pacult. The first match under the new coach was a 3:2 win in the German Cup (1st round) versus VfL Wolfsburg from the Bundesliga. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Players out on loan=== ==Coach history== Head coach Nationality From Until Days Notes 1 1 July 2009 30 May 2010 align=left 2 1 July 2010 30 June 2011 align=left 3 1 July 2011 30 June 2012 align=left 4 1 July 2012 10 February 2015 align=left 5 11 February 2015 30 June 2015 align=left Note 1 6 1 July 2015 30 June 2016 align=left 7 1 July 2016 16 May 2018 align=left 8 9 July 2018 30 June 2019 align=left 9 1 July 2019 30 June 2021 align=left 10 1 July 2021 5 December 2021 align=left 11 5 December 2021 9 December 2021 align=left Note 1 12 9 December 2021 align=left <span id=\"Notes >Notes # Interim coach. ==Honours== *2010 Champion Oberliga Nordost 2017 DFB Pokal Runners up 2017 Bundesliga Runners up 2016 Bundesliga 2 Champions 2014 3.Liga Champions ==References== Category:2009 establishments in Germany Category:Football clubs owned by Red Bull Category:Leipzig Category:Football clubs in Saxony",
