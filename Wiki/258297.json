 "text": "A halide is a chemical compound containing a halogen atom in the -1 oxidation state. This means it has an extra electron compared to a normal atom. This can be because the atom is an ion, or because it has a covalent bond to a less electronegative element. The four major halides are fluoride, chloride, bromide, and iodide. A few astatides have been made in labs. No compounds of tennessine are known.",
