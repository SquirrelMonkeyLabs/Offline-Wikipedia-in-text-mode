The second bomb exploded in the Tavern in the Town, killing eleven people. A third bomb was planted in the doorway of a branch of Barclays bank. It was found by a policeman and did not explode. The Birmingham bombings were 20th century England's most deadly terrorist attack. Six Irishmen were arrested within hours of the blasts, and in 1975 sentenced to life imprisonment for the bombings. The men—who became known as the Birmingham Six—continued to say that they were innocent and believed that the police had forced them into signing false confessions through abuse. After 16 years in prison, their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in 1991. == References == Category:1974 in the United Kingdom Category:1970s crimes in Europe Category:1970s disasters in Europe Category:1970s explosions Category:Attacks on bars Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in the 1970s Pub bombings Category:Building bombings in England Category:Mass murder in England Category:Mass murder in the 1970s Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army Category:Terrorist incidents in the 1970s",
