 "text": "Ignosticism is the belief that people should avoid taking a position on whether God exists until a concept of God has been defined. Ignostics claim that the sound and letters \"God\" (with a capital \"G\") are meaningless because there has never been a coherent definition of the word. Ignostics argue that monotheists use circular reasoning when they say that \"God made everything that exists except God\". This defines \"God\" in terms of \"God\", and also gives no description for \"God\" since \"what something did\" is not the same as \"what something is\". It is sometimes considered synonymous with theological noncognitivism. Category:Religion",
