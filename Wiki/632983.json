 "text": "Palaeoscincus (meaning \"ancient skink\" in Greek) is a genus of ankylosaurian dinosaur based on teeth discovered in Montana. Like several other dinosaur genera named by Joseph Leidy (Deinodon, Thespesius, and Trachodon), it is an historically important genus with a convoluted taxonomy that has been all but abandoned by modern dinosaur paleontologists. Because of its wide use in the early 20th century, Palaeoscincus is often shown with the armor of Edmontonia and the tail club of an ankylosaurid. ==References== Category:Ankylosauria",
