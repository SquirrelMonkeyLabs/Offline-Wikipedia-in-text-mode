 "text": "The Chase is a British television game show that airs on ITV. It started on 29 June 2009. It is presented by Bradley Walsh. So far, it has run for thirteen series. == Gameplay == Four players work together as a team. At the start, each player takes a turn in answering as many questions as they can in 60 seconds. Each correct answer is worth £1,000. This money goes into the player's bank. After all four players have their turn, they then take turns going against the \"Chaser.\" === The Chase === At the start, the player's money goes on a sloped board. The board has seven spaces. The player starts three spaces ahead of the Chaser. The Chaser then offers two amounts: one higher than their bank, and one lower than their bank. For example, if the player won £6,000, the Chaser might offer £12,000 as the high amount and £3,000 as the low amount. If the player takes the high amount, their head start is lowered to two spaces. If they take the low amount, their head start is increased to four spaces. After the player decides on what to do, the player and the Chaser are both asked the same multiple-choice question. They both lock in their answers at the same time. If one answers and the other does not do so at the same time, a five-second time limit is given for the one that did not answer. If the player answers correctly, they move one space closer to the bottom of the board. If the Chaser answers correctly, they move one space closer to \"catching\" the player. If an incorrect answer is given by either, they stay where they are on the board. If the player reaches the end of the board, their amount is added to the team bank. However, if the Chaser catches the player, the player is out of the game, and their bank is lost. This is done three more times with the other three players. The players still in the game move on to the Final Chase. If all four players are caught, their bank is set to £4,000, and they must choose one player to play the Final Chase. === The Final Chase === The player(s) still in the game face the Chaser to win their prize money. They start with a one-step head start for each player in the Final Chase. They then have two minutes to answer as many questions as they can. Each correct answer gives them another step. After their time ends, the Chaser is given two minutes to catch the player(s). If the Chaser passes or wrong-answers on a question, the clock stops and the question is given to the team to answer; if they do so correctly, the Chaser moves back a step. If the Chaser does not catch them in the allotted two minutes, the player(s) win their prize money, shared equally. If the Chaser does catch them, the player(s) leave with nothing. == Spin-offs == === The Celebrity Chase === In the celebrity version, the format is exactly the same but the celebrities are competing for charity money. Even if the Chaser wins, they are each given £1000 for their charity. === Beat the Chasers === This version gives a player an opportunity to face all of the Chasers at once in a cash-builder round. == Chasers == Each Chaser is given their own nickname for dramatic purposes: * The Beast (2009-present) * The Dark Destroyer (2009-present) * The Governess (2010-present) * The Sinnerman (2011-present) * The Vixen (2015-present) * The Menace (2020-present) == Other websites == * The Chase on ITV's website * The Chase on UKGameshows.com Category:2009 British television series debuts Category:2000s British television series Category:2010s British television series Category:2020s British television series Category:ITV game shows Category:English-language television programs",
