 "text": "Fig wasps are wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea which spend their larval stage inside figs. Most pollinate the figs, but others simply feed on the plant. The non-pollinators belong to several groups in the superfamily Chalcidoidea. So, the fig wasps are a polyphyletic group: they include several unrelated lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs. The pollinators are all in the family Agaonidae. They make galls. The other types either make their own galls or use the galls of other fig wasps.Boucek Z. 1988.
