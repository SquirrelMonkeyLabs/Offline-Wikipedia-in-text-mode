 "text": "Farouk I (; Arabic: فاروق الأول, full name: Farouk bin Ahmed Fuad bin Ismail bin Ibrahim bin Muhammad Ali bin Ibrahim Agha; 11 February 1920 — 18 March 1965) was the King of Egypt and the Sudan from 1936 until his abdication in 1952. His full title was \"His Majesty Farouk I, by the grace of God, King of Egypt and the Sudan\". As king, Farouk was known for his extravagant playboy lifestyle. After the death of his father, King Fuad I in 1936, Farouk became king at the age of 16. He was very popular among the people. However, as time went by, Farouk's popularity slowly declined, perhaps due to the corruption and incompetence of his government. Eventually, the Egyptian military, led by General Mohamed Naguib and the other Free Officers started a coup d'état. This started the Egyptian Revolution. Farouk was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of his infant son, Ahmed Fuad, who succeeded him as King Fuad II. However, a year later in 1953, the monarchy was abolished and Egypt was declared a republic. Mohamed Naguib became its first ever President. Farouk died in exile in Rome, Italy in 1965 at the age of 45. His sister, Princess Fawzia Fuad, was the first wife and consort of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. ==Other websites== * * *Farouk and Narriman: Egypt’s Last Royal Romance |- == Sources == * * * * * * Category:1920 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Exiled royalty Category:People from Cairo Category:Egyptian royalty",
