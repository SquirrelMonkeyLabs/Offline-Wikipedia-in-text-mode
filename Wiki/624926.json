He acted as a double agent for Britain's intelligence services during the 1990s and early 2000s. In December 2004, he was arrested by Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and later tried, convicted of high treason, and imprisoned. He settled in the UK in 2010 following the Illegals Program spy swap and moved to Salisbury, Wiltshire. On 4 March 2018, Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent, later identified as Novichok. They were in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. The poisoning is being investigated as an attempted murder. On 9 April 2018, Yulia Skripal was discharged from hospital and taken to a secure location. On 18 May 2018, Sergei Skripal was discharged from the hospital too. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:British intelligence people Category:Russian crime victims Category:Russian intelligence people Category:Russian military people Category:Soviet intelligence people Category:Soviet military people Category:Spies",
