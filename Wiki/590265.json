 "text": "Ares (also sometimes Mars) is a fictional supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Based on the Greek mythological figure of the same name, he is the Greek god of war and serves as a major adversary of the superhero Wonder Woman within the DC Universe. == Fictional character biography == An immortal being who draws his power from belief and conflict, Ares was worshipped by many on Earth as a god of Olympus. Eventually, that belief waned and the gods stepped back from regularly interfering with humanity. But, centuries later, Ares returned to encourage war through his manipulation of mortals. == Powers and abilities == He can shapeshift into any form he wishes and can teleport himself and others. At one time, he was also recognized as the Death God of the Greek Pantheon, having control over the dead and able to resurrect and command a whole army of undead from the Underworld to do his will, and then send them back whenever he wished. == In other media == The character has appeared in various forms of media. Alfred Molina voiced him in the 2009 direct-to-video animated movie Wonder Woman. Ares later made his live-action debut in the 2017 movie Wonder Woman and Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021), where he is portrayed by English actor David Thewlis. ==References== Category:DC Comics characters Category:Wonder Woman Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1942",
