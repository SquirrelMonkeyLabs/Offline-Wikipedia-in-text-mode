 "text": "A cobra roll is a part of a roller coaster. It is a double-inversion and it looks like the shape of a striking cobra's head. A cobra roll has two half- vertical loops facing the same direction joined together by two half corkscrews that each twist in opposite directions. The coaster train enters the cobra roll' low, completes the first half loop, then turns perpendicular into a half corkscrew, completing a first inversion. This is immediately followed by another half corkscrew that twists in the opposite direction into the other half vertical loop, completing a second inversion and exiting the cobra roll traveling in the opposite direction from which it entered. ==References== Category:Roller coasters",
