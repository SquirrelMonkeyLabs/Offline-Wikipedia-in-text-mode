 "text": ":For the constant pertaining to energy of black body radiation see Stefan–Boltzmann constant Values of k Units J K−1 eV K−1 erg K−1 The Boltzmann constant (k or kB) is a physical constant. It is defined to be J/K. It relates the average kinetic energy of a particle in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant R divided by the Avogadro constant NA: :k = \\frac{R}{N_{\\rm A}}\\, The Boltzmann constant has SI units of J⋅K−1 (also written J/K), the same as entropy. It is named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. ==References== Category:Thermodynamics Category:Physics",
