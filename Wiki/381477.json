 "text": "The Division of Parramatta is an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was created in 1900 for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the locality of Parramatta. The name Parramatta is an Aboriginal word for \"the place where the eels lie down\". The division is in the western suburbs of Sydney. It includes Constitution Hill, Dundas Valley, Granville, Harris Park, Holroyd, Mays Hill, North Parramatta, Oatlands, Old Toongabbie, Parramatta, Rosehill, Rydalmere, Telopea, Wentworthville, Westmead and parts of Dundas, Ermington, Guildford, Merrylands, Merrylands West, Northmead, North Rocks, Pendle Hill, South Granville and South Wentworthville. The division lies between Labor voting areas of western Sydney and the Liberal areas on the North Shore. Because of this, any change to the boundary can change the political balance in the seat. For example, in the 2006 boundary change, Parramatta shifted from marginally Labor to marginally Liberal (as defined by the Australian Electoral Commission). Nevertheless, as was expected Julie Owens held the seat for the ALP with an increased majority. ==Members== Member Party Term (Sir) Joseph Cook Free Trade, Anti-Socialist 1901–1909 Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1917 Nationalist 1917–1921 Herbert Pratten Nationalist 1921–1922 Eric Bowden Nationalist 1922–1929 Albert Rowe Labor 1929–1931 (Sir) Frederick Stewart United Australia 1931–1946 Howard Beale Liberal 1946–1958 Sir Garfield Barwick Liberal 1958–1964 Nigel Bowen Liberal 1964-1973 Philip Ruddock Liberal 1973–1977 John Brown Labor 1977–1990 Paul Elliott Labor 1990–1996 Ross Cameron Liberal 1996–2004 Julie Owens Labor 2004–present From 1901 to 1921 the Division was represented by Sir Joseph Cook who was the Prime Minister of Australia from 1913-14.
