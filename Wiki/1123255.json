 "text": "Andinobates tolimensis is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Body== The adult frog is 17.39 to 18.91 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult male frog is smaller than the adult female frog. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks on the front feet are bigger than the disks on the back feet. The skin of the frog's back is brown or dark brown in color. It has metal yellow- bronze color on its head and mouth and the front of its back and parts of the front legs. It has a dark brown stripe from each eye, over the eardrum to where the front leg meets the body. The belly is dark brown and can have blue- green spots. The iris of the eye is dark brown in color. The male frog's voice sounds like a soft buzz or like a cricket insect. ==Name== Scientists named the frog after a town near where they found it: Tolima. ==Home== Scientists saw this frog in a small forest that had been cut down and is growing back 1852 meters above sea level. It has small trees with smaller plants growing on them. There are dead leaves on the ground with moss and fungus. The leaves and branches come together like a roof so the forest is dark. This frog lives on the ground and is awake during the day. It hides in holes in tree roots and under dead leaves on the ground. This frog lives in the same place as Andinobates dorisswansonae. Scientists can tell which frog is which because they are different colors. The place where this frog lives is in a protected park: Ranita Dorada Reserve. But this place has farms all around it, so the frog cannot move to other forests. ==Young== Scientists saw one group of eggs. The eggs were brown. They also saw one male frog carrying a tadpole on his back. He was near bromeliad and heliconia plants. The tadpoles are dark brown in color and lighter brown on the belly. The head and body are wider than they are tall. The eyes are on the top of the head and the mouth is on the bottom of the front of the head. The tip of the tail is clear. One tadpole was 4.4 mm long from the head to the rear end not counting the tail. With the tail, it was 13.1 mm long. The tail was 8.7 mm long. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because people people cut down forests to make places farms, for example big coffee farms. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
