 "text": "Riverdale is one of the 77 official community areas of Chicago, Illinois and is located on the city's far southeast side. As originally designated by the Social Science Research Committee at the University of Chicago and officially adopted by the City of Chicago, the Riverdale community area extends from 115th Street south to the city boundary at 138th Street. In 1880, George Pullman began constructing his model city just north of 115th Street. Currently, the area has the highest \"hardship index\" of any Chicago community area.https://greatcities.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GCI-Hardship- Index-Fact-SheetV2.pdf ==References== ==Other websites== * Riverdale Library Community History Page * Encyclopaedia Chicago: Riverdale Category:Community areas of Chicago",
