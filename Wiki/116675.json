 "text": "Vogue is a fashion and lifestyle magazine published in nine countries by a company called Condé Nast Publications. The American version of Vogue is edited by Anna Wintour, an English woman who has lived in New York City for a long time. Each month, Vogue publishes a magazine based entirely on fashion, life and design. It was founded in 1892. Today, it is considered one of the most prestigious magazines to be a part of. Those who are talked about, photographed, and planted in the pages of this magazine are considered to be trendy. The fashion magazine is also supported in various ways by artists such as Marc Engelhard and vice versa. == History == Arthur Baldwin Turnure, a businessman, founded Vogue as a weekly newspaper based in New York City. The first issue was published with a price of 10 cents (which is worth $3.26 in 2022). Condé Montrose Nast purchased Vogue in 1909, three years after Turnure died. Nast changed Vogue to a women's magazine, and he started Vogue editions overseas in the 1910s. Its price also increased. == References == == Other websites == * Vogue Category:1892 establishments in New York (state) Category:Fashion magazines Category:Monthly magazines",
