 "text": "Sumaco Napo-Galeras National Park () is a place in Ecuador. It is a protected park. It is a place for animals to live. ==Place== This park is in Napo Province and Orellana Province. The top of the Sumaco volcano is 3,732 m above sea level. This is the highest place in the park. The lowest place in the park is 600 m above sea level. ==Animals== Scientists know that about 280 birds live in the park, but they think many more live there too. Some of these birds are Dysithamnus occidentalis, Touit stictoptera, Ara militaris, and Galbula pastazae. Scientists looked at mammals 2500 m up on Mt. Sumaco and found 17 species, including eight species of bats. There were also big mammals: Panthera onca, Tremarctos ornatus, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, Tapirus pinchaque, and Puma concolor. Scientists do not know about other animals, but they think there are many amphibians and reptiles there too. For some amphibians, scientists have only seen them in this park, for example the toad Osornophryne sumacoensis. Scientists have only seen Pristimantis ernesti on the top of Sumaco. ==References== Category:National parks in Ecuador Category:Napo Province Category:Orellana Province",
