 "text": "Abuse of power is the act of taking advantage of one's high authority in order to control what other people with lower authority are able to do. Abuse of power is often associated with corruption. Often, presidents are charged with abuse of power because they pressure all of the less powerful politicians into doing things that the other politicians disagree with. Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, was impeached on December 2019 because of a scandal where he agreed with Ukraine to manipulate the 2020 presidential election in exchange for foreign aid. ==References== Category:Human rights Category:Political philosophy",
