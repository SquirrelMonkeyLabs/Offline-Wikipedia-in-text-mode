 "text": "The South Island oystercatcher, South Island pied oystercatcher, New Zealand oystercatcher, or t≈çrea (Haematopus finschi) is a bird in the family Haematopodidae. It lives in New Zealand but it also goes to Australia. ==Appearance== This bird has black and white feathers, pink legs, and a long red bill, or beak. ==Habitat== This bird spends most of its time in estuaries places where rivers mix with the ocean or by the coast. When it is time for them to lay eggs, they go near rivers, in farmland, and sometimes grasslands. They build nests on the ground out of gravel or earth. ==Food== When this bird lives in estuaries or the coast, it eats mollusks, for example oysters and other animals with two shells. It also eats crustaceans, earthworms, and insect larvae. Scientists do not know what it eats when it flies inland to build nests. ==Threats== There were about 40,000 birds alive in the early 1970s and 112,000 in the early 1990s. ==References== Category:Birds of New Zealand Category:Charadriiformes Category:Birds of Australia",
