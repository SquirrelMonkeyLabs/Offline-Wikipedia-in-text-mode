The table service used for this meal is on display to this day at the oldest existing restaurant in Paris, La Tour d'Argent which is owned by the descendants of Claudius Burdel, the last owner of Café Anglais which was demolished in 1913. The evening of 7 June 1867 is reputed to have been the most magnificent ever to have occurred in any restaurant in the world. The three emperors and Prince Bismarck had requested of Dugléré a meal that would live in their memories and the maître de cave, Claudius Burdel, was instructed to accompany the dishes with the greatest wines in the world. == Dishes == The most famous dish attributed to Dugléré is almost certainly Pommes Anna.
