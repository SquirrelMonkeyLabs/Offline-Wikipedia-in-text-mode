 "text": "A unit of length is a way of measuring length or distance. Common units of length in the International System of Units (SI) are: * metre and units that are developed from it, such as \"centimetre\" or \"kilometre\" But there are a lot of units that do not fit in the SI-System: * fermi (fm) (= 1 femtometre in SI units) * angstrom (Ã…) (= 100 picometres in SI units) * micron (= 1 micrometre in SI units) * Norwegian/Swedish mil (= 10,000 metres) Common Imperial units and U.S. customary units of length include: * inch (25.4 mm) * mil (one thousandth of an inch, one thou) * foot (0.3048 m, 12 inches) * yard (0.9144 m) * (terrestrial) mile (1609.344 m) In addition, the following are used by mariners: * fathom (for depth) (1.8288 m) * nautical mile (1852 m) Surveyors in the United States continue to use: * chain (~20.1m) * rod (also called pole or perch) (~5 m) Horse racing keeps alive: * furlong (~201 m) Astronomical measure uses: *astronomical unit (AU) (~149 gigametres) *light year (ly) (~9.46 petametres) *parsec (pc) (~30.8 petametres), including kiloparsec (kpc) and megaparsec (Mpc) Physics also uses: *Planck length *Bohr radius Old units of distance are: *cana *cubit *league *li (China) *pace (the \"double pace\" of about 5 feet used in Ancient Rome) *verst (Russia) In everyday conversation, and in informal literature, it is common to see lengths measured in units of objects of which everyone knows the approximate width. Common examples are: *Football field (generally around 110 metres, depending on the country) *Widths of a human hair (around 80 micrometres)",
