 "text": "Good Girl Gone Bad is the third studio album released by Barbadian singer Rihanna. The singles from the album includes \"Umbrella\", \"Breakin' Dishes\", \"Shut Up and Drive\", \"Hate That I Love You\", \"Don't Stop the Music\", and \"Rehab\". The album is a departure from the reggae sound of Rihanna's previous albums for a more pop, dance-pop and R&B; album. == The Good Girl Gone Bad Tour == Rihanna did a worldwide concert tour on September 15, three months after the release of the album. The tour had three parts with sixty-one shows. It ended on April 5, 2008. The first part of the tour began in Canada. It included eleven shows across the country with Akon. The tour later went through United States and Europe without Akon. Supporting acts for the tour were Akon, Ciara and David Jordan. * \"Disturbia\" was the re-release's third single and the album's seventh single overall. It was released to radio on June 17, 2008. The song made its debut at number eighteen on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This was Rihanna's highest debut to date on the chart. The single has since become Rihanna's third number one single from the album on the Hot 100. It has also reached number one in New Zealand. It was her second number one song from the album, following \"Umbrella\". It has gone top ten in places including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and on the Canadian Hot 100. It has so far reached the top ten in nine countries, and the top twenty in eleven countries. The video was first shown on July 22, 2008. == Track listing == ;Notes * denotes a vocal producer * denotes a co-producer * denotes a remixer and additional producer * \"Push Up on Me\" samples \"Running with the Night\", as written by Lionel Richie and Cynthia Weil, and performed by Richie. * \"Don't Stop the Music\" samples \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\", as written and performed by Michael Jackson, which itself samples \"Soul Makossa\", as performed by Manu Dibango. * \"Shut Up and Drive\" samples \"Blue Monday\", as written and performed by New Order (Stephen Morris, Peter Hook, Bernard Sumner and Gillian Gilbert). * \"Say It\" samples \"Flex\", as written by Ewart Brown, Clifton Dillon, Sly Dunbar and Brian Thompson, and performed by Mad Cobra. ==Personnel== Credits for Good Girl Gone Bad adapted from AllMusic. *Jon Marius Aareskjold – engineer, guitar engineer *Angela Allen – marketing coordinator *Stevie Blacke – cello, violin *Tim Blacksmith – management *Jay Brown – A&R; *Ed Calle – conductor, horn conductor, orchestration *Carter Administration – executive producer *Shawn Carter – additional personnel, guest artist, primary artist, rap *Demacio Castellon – engineer, mixing *Danny D – management *Kevin \"KD\" Davis – mixing *Roberto Deste – photography *William Durst – engineer *Mikkel Storleer Eriksen – engineer, instrumentation, musician *Terence Franklyn – assistant, assistant engineer *Rodrigo Gallardo – trumpet *Chris Gehringer – mastering *Richard \"Rico\" Gonzales – engineer *Augie Haas – trumpet *Kuk Harrell – engineer, vocal producer *Al Hemberger – engineer, mixing *Rob Heselden – production coordination *Ricardo \"Slick\" Hinkson – assistant engineer *Josh Houghkirk – assistant, mixing Assistant *Marc Jordan – management *Terese Joseph – A&R; *Doug Joswick – package production *Anthony Kilhoffer – engineer *John Kricker – trombone *Hannon Lane – keyboards, producer *Daniel Laporte – engineer *Mathieu Lejeune – engineer *Mat LeJeuneat – engineer *Fabienne Leys – artist coordination *Espen Lind – guitar *Adam Lowenberg – marketing, mastering *Deborah Mannis-Gardner – sample clearance *Manny Marroquin – mixing *Roy Matthews – assistant, mixing assistant *Doug Michels – trumpet *Christie Moran – production assistant *Stephen Morris – composer *Shaffer \"Ne-Yo\" Smith – additional personnel, producer, rap, vocal producer *Greg Ogan – engineer *Deepu Panjwani – assistant engineer *Ciarra Pardo – art direction, design *Phillip Ramos – assistant engineer *Makeba Riddick – vocal producer *Rihanna – vocals *Dusty Robbennolt – assistant engineer *J.
