 "text": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis. There is a long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine. Usually the joints where the spine joins the pelvis (the sacroiliac joints) are also affected. Eye and bowel problems may also occur. Pain in the back is a typical symptom of AS, and it often comes and goes. Stiffness of the affected joints usually gets worse over time. Ankylosing spondylitis inflames the sacroiliac joints located between the base of the spine and pelvis from there the disease starts and gradually captures the entire spinal cord and there is complete tilt in the body. Some of the bones in the spine fuse, this fusing makes the spine less flexible. If ribs are affected, it can be difficult to breathe deeply. == What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis? == * Pain and stiffness * Joint pain * Neck pain * Back pain or hip pain * Stiffness in the body when waking up * Breathing Problems * Chest Pain * Bone fever * Fatigue * Vision Problems * Loss of appetite * Irritability If the pain in the back bone lasts more than 3 months and the stiffness is more on getting up in the morning, then a rheumatologist should be seen as soon as possible. In this disease, the bones of the spine are completely fused, ie, the bones joining in this disease become one bone in 8-10 years, which then means the patient can not get up, sit, walk, bend, twist of the neck. It shuts down and affects all day-to-day activities. ==References== == Other websites == *What are ankylosing spondylitis causes?
