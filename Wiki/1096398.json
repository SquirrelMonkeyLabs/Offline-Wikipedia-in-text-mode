 "text": "Air Mata di Kuala Lumpur is a song by the Malaysian artist P. Ramlee. He wrote it before he died on May 29, 1973, at 44 years old. His wife, Saloma, recorded the song. It was meant for a movie with the same name, which would have been P. Ramlee's first color film as a director. Sadly, P. Ramlee passed away before the movie could be made. Saloma's recording of the song was later released as the title track of an album in 1974. ==References== Category:1973 songs",
