 "text": "A shadow cabinet is a term which applies in some parliamentary democracies based on the UK parliamentary tradition. It is a group of politicians who hold a political position in their party, but whose party is not in government (that is, an opposition party). A member of the shadow cabinet is a shadow minister. The leader of a shadow cabinet is called the Leader of the Opposition. The term is of United Kingdom origin, and is used by some members of the Commonwealth. Some elements are found in other democratic systems of government. Each minister of a Cabinet has a corresponding shadow minister. The shadow minister may provide alternative policies to the minister in the government. The two of them may debate on issues relating to their area of jurisdiction. For example, the British \"Shadow Secretary of State for Health\" often replies to the Secretary of State for Health. The current UK Shadow Cabinet is made up of members of the Conservative Party. The term refers only to the party in opposition which has the most seats of the opposition parties. == References == Category:Parliamentary procedure",
