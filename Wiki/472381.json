 "text": "Tonjiru is a Japanese soup. This soup is cooked to boil miso, potatoes, carrots, burdocks and pork. However, it is rare for Japanese people to use pork. Tonjiru is usually eaten warm, so it is popular during the winter. ==Recipe== The recipe consists of vegetables boiled in a soup stock flavored with miso. After the cooking is finished, the soup is then topped off with cut green onions. ==History== Tonjiru probably originated from the Meiji era. During the Asuka era, the Imperial court banned people from eating meat. Boar meats however were not banned, and so they ate it as a Botannnabe. Therefore, it is said that Tonjiru is based on Botannnabe. ==Local ingredients== *Hokkaido - Potatoes, onions and butter *Aomori and Tohoku district - Sweet potatoes, Japanese parsley, Chinese yams, strings of konnyaku and Chinese cabbage *Kagoshima - Taro or sweet potatoes *Kochi - Ginger and Japanese ginger *Shimane - Sake lees *Miyazaki - Yuzu pepper *Nagano - Mushrooms *Chugoku district - Chinese cabbage *Kinki district - Bean sprouts *Kyushu district - A block of deep-fried bean curd ==References== 1\\.
