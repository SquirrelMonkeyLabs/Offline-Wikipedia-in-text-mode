 "text": "Venus of Willendorf or Woman of Willendorf, is an 11.1 cm (4.4 inches) high statuette of a woman or woman-like thing. Someone carved it in prehistoric times, perhaps 30,000 years ago. Archaeologist Josef Szombathy found it in 1908 near Willendorf. The statuette is made of a kind of limestone called oolite. There is no oolite near Willendorf, so scientists think someone carried the stone a very long way. The statue is colored with red ochre. Willendorf is a village in Lower Austria near the city of Krems. A study from 1990 said the statue was made between 24,000 and 22,000 BCE. Scientists think someone in the Gravettian culture carved it using flint tools. A study from 2022 said that the oolite in the statue matched oolite from northern Italy, which means someone must have carried the stone over or around the Alps and Danube river. Venus of Willendorf is part of the collection of the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna . Since 1908, archaeologists have found many more statuettes of fat women, like the Venus, so they are called Venus figurines too. ==References== == Other websites == * Christopher L. C. E.
