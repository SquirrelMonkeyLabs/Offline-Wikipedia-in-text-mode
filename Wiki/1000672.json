 "text": "Swagger is a suite of tools for API developers from SmartBear Software. It is a former specification upon which the OpenAPI Specification is based. ==History== The Swagger API project was created in 2011 by Tony Tam, technical co-founder of the dictionary site Wordnik. During the development of Wordnik's products, the need for automation of API documentation and client SDK generation became a major source of frustration. Tam designed a simple JSON representation of the API, building upon the flexibility of part of the REST style of architecture. Using Swagger quickly gained popularity among API developers due to its ability to generate interactive documentation, client libraries, and server stubs automatically from API specifications. In 2015, the Swagger project was acquired by SmartBear Software, a company that specializes in software quality tools and API testing. SmartBear continues to develop and support Swagger and the OpenAPI Specification, which has become the industry standard for defining RESTful APIs. ==Features== Swagger provides a suite of tools for designing, building, documenting, and testing RESTful APIs. Some of its key features include: * Interactive documentation: Swagger UI allows developers to view and interact with the API in a web browser, making it easy to understand and test the API's functionality. * Code generation: Swagger Codegen can generate client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation in various programming languages based on an API's specification. * API testing: Swagger Inspector is a cloud-based tool for testing and validating APIs, with support for various authentication methods and response validations. * API design: Swagger Editor is a web-based tool for designing and editing API specifications in YAML or JSON format. * API management: SwaggerHub is a platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on API designs, with features for versioning, team collaboration, and API documentation publishing. ==Related pages== * OpenAPI Specification * RESTful * API Gateway ==References== ==Other websites== * Swagger website * Swagger on GitHub Category:Software",
