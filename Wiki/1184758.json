 "text": "In meteorology, convective available potential energy (commonly abbreviated as CAPE), is a measure of the ability of air to support upward motion of air that can lead to storm formation. Some conditions, usually very warm, moist air that cools with height, can make storms. That causes the CAPE value (a measurement of potential energy) would be higher. In opposite conditions, the CAPE value would be low. == Mechanics == CAPE is located in the troposphere. The equation below is how CAPE is calculated, using calculus.\\mathrm{CAPE} = \\int_{z_\\mathrm{f}}^{z_\\mathrm{n}} g \\left(\\frac{T_\\mathrm{v,parcel} - T_\\mathrm{v,env}}{T_\\mathrm{v,env}}\\right) \\, dz z_f in this equation is the height of convection. z_\\mathrm{n} in this equation is the height of where there is neutral buoyancy, meaning that the clouds don't float or fall. T_\\mathrm{v,parcel} is the temperature of the air measured. T_\\mathrm{v,env} is the temperature of the environment in Kelvin. g is the amount of speed gained due to gravity. == Significance to thunderstorms == Higher instability in the air leads to more storm development. ==References== Category:Meteorology",
