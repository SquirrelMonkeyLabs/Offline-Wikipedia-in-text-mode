 "text": "A chronicle (, from Greek , from , chronos, \"time\") is an account of historical events, arranged in order from earliest to latest. A chronicle is different from a narrative or history, as events which are not believed to be important may be excluded from the latter; a chronicler is more concerned with documenting events in sequential order. The Nuremberg Chronicle, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ecclesiastical History of the English People, are the most famous chronicles in English-speaking countries. Category:History books",
