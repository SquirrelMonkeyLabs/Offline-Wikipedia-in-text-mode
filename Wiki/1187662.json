 "text": "The Tonchek spiny-chest frog (Alsodes gargola) is a frog. It lives in Chile and Argentina. ==Home== This frog lives near lakes and streams high on the hills where there are no big trees. Some adult frogs spend the winter on land and some spend it in the water. Scientists have seen the frog between 200 and 2200 meters above sea level. This frog lives in at least three protected places: Nahuel Huapi National Park, Los Alerces National Park, and Lago Puelo National Park. ==Young== This animal spends 2-4 years swimming as a tadpole before growing legs and becoming a frog. The tadpoles eat dead things. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Trout fish that people brought from other parts of the world can also hurt this frog. Scientists are not sure if the trout have killed enough of them to be a threat. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
