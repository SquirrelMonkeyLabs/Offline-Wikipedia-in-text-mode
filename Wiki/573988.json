 "text": "The WWE Women's Championship is a professional wrestling championship in WWE competed for by women of the SmackDown brand. It was created on April 3, 2016 at WrestleMania 32 and replaced the WWE Divas Championship as the women's title in WWE. Between September 2016 and June 2023 it was called the WWE Raw Women's Championship and was exclusive to the Raw brand. == History == At WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, Lita announced that a new WWE Women's Championship would be created. In the process, the Divas Championship would be retired. Later in the night, the Divas Champion Charlotte beat Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks to win the new Women's Championship. The title shares its name with the old Women's Championship. However, the new title does not share the same title history as the original. The first Women's Championship was unified with the Divas Championship in 2010. As result, they combined their histories. In the draft that took place on July 19, 2016, Charlotte was drafted to Raw and the title was renamed \"WWE Raw Women's Championship\" on September 5. It became exclusive to SmackDown on April 28, 2023, when champion Bianca Belair was drafted there. It got its old name back on June 9 and its design was also changed. == Reigns == Reign The reign number Location The city in which the title was won Event The event in which the title was won — Used for vacated reigns \\+ The current reign is changing daily {| class=\"sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"100%\" !width=0 data-sort-type=\"number\"|No. !width=14%|Champion !width=0 data-sort-type=\"number\"|Reign !width=16%|Date !width=0 data-sort-type=\"number\"|Days held !width=14%|Location !width=16%|Event !width=54% class=\"unsortable\"|Notes !width=0 class=\"unsortable\"|Ref. |- !1 |Charlotte |1 | | |Arlington, Texas |WrestleMania 32 |align=left|This was a triple threat match also involving Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks.
