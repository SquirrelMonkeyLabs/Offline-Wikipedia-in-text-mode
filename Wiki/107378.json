 "text": "Coconut water is the liquid inside young coconuts. Coconut water is a popular drink in tropical islands especially in tropical Asia, Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. It is packaged and sold. It is sometimes sold as a sports drink, but not everyone agrees that it should be called a sports drink. Coconuts hold the most water when they are young and green. Coconuts in different parts of the world do not taste the same. Pakistani Coconuts are salty, and Brazilian Coconuts have sweeter water. The water inside dark brown rotted coconuts is bitter. == References == Category:Drinks Category:Coconuts",
