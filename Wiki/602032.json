However, at birth, since Tityos grew so big, Elara womb could not hold him longer and Elara died at birth. His surrogate mother was Gaia. Hera tasked him to rape Leto which caused Tityos to be hunted by Apollo and Artemis for attempting to rape their mother Leto when she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho. His punishment in Tartarus was to be tortured by two vultures who fed on his liver, which grew back every night. == References == Category:Greek legendary creatures",
