 "text": "Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (October 11, 1884 − November 7, 1962) was an American diplomat and political activist. She was the first lady of the United States from 1933 to 1945 as the wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd U.S. president. She was also the first lady of New York from 1929 to 1933 when her husband was governor. She was a member of the prominent and wealthy American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. Historians have consistently ranked Roosevelt as the greatest first lady in American history. == Biography == === Early life === Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was born on October 11, 1884, in Manhattan, New York City, to Anna Rebecca Hall and Elliott Roosevelt. From an early age she preferred to be called by her middle name, Eleanor. Through her father, she was a niece of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States. Roosevelt had two younger brothers named Elliott Jr. and Hall Roosevelt. She also had a half-brother named Elliott Roosevelt Mann. Her mother died from diphtheria on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. died of the same disease the next year. Her father died on August 14, 1894, after jumping from a window during a fit of delirium tremens. He survived the fall but died from a seizure. Her brother Hall later suffered from alcoholism. After the deaths of her parents, Roosevelt was raised by her maternal grandmother, Mary Livingston Ludlow Hall in Tivoli, New York. === Education === Roosevelt was to Allenswood Academy at the age of 15, a private finishing school in Wimbledon, London, England, where she was educated from 1899 to 1902. The headmistress, Marie Souvestre, took a special interest in Roosevelt, who learned to speak French fluently and gained self- confidence. Roosevelt was active with the New York Junior League, that taught dancing and calisthenics in the East Side slums. === Marriage and family === In the summer of 1902, Roosevelt met her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret romance, and got engaged on November 22, 1903. The got were married on March 17, 1905, in New York City. President Theodore Roosevelt's attendance at the ceremony was front-page news in The New York Times and other newspapers. They had six children named, Anna Roosevelt Halsted, James Roosevelt II,Franklin Roosevelt, Elliott Roosevelt,Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., and John Roosevelt. == First lady of the United States == Roosevelt became the first lady of the United States when her husband was sworn in as the 33rd president on March 4, 1933. As first lady, Roosevelt was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. She became one of the only voices in her husband's administration insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences and in 1940 became the first to speak at a national party convention. She also wrote a daily newspaper called, \"My Day\". She was the first for a presidential spouse to do this. She was also the fist presidential wife to write a monthly magazine column and to host a weekly radio show. In the first year of her husband's administration, Roosevelt earned $75,000 from her lectures and writing, most of which she gave to charity. By 1941, she was receiving lecture fees of $1,000, and was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at one of her lectures to celebrate her achievements. === Civil rights activism === Roosevelt also broke with tradition by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House. In 1936 she became aware of conditions at the National Training School for Girls, a predominantly Black reform school once located in the Palisades neighborhood of Washington, D.C. She visited the school, wrote about it in her \"My Day\" column, where she asked for additional funding, and pressed for changes in staffing and curriculum. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. She also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. Roosevelt lobbied behind the scenes for the 1934 Costigan- Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, including arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Roosevelt's support of African-American rights made her an unpopular figure among whites in the South. At the same time, she grew so popular among African-Americans. === World War II === Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt spoke out against Japanese-American prejudice. She also privately opposed her husband's Executive Order 9066, which required Japanese- Americans in many areas of the U.S. to enter internment camps. On May 10, 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, As the U.S. began to move toward war, Roosevelt found herself again depressed, fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become fail, and cause the nation to focused on foreign affairs. She briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the Red Cross, but was warned by presidential advisers that the president's wife could be captured as a prisoner of war. She soon found other wartime causes to work on, however, beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children. She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis, including Jews, but fears of fifth columnists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it. Roosevelt successfully secured political refugee status for eighty-three Jewish refugees from the S.S. Quanza in August 1940. == Post-White House activities == After her husband died on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia.

She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to the Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946. === United Nations === In December 1945, President Harry S. Truman appointed Roosevelt as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. In April 1946, she became the first chairperson of the preliminary United Nations Commission on Human Rights. Roosevelt remained chairperson when the commission was established on a permanent basis in January 1947. Along with René Cassin, John Peters Humphrey and others, she played a key role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Roosevelt also served as the first United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and stayed on at that position until 1953, even after stepping down as chair of the commission in 1951. The UN awarded her one of its first Human Rights Prizes in 1968 in recognition of her work. In the 1940s, Roosevelt was among the first people to support the creation of a UN agency specialized in the issues of food and nutrition. === Other activities === In 1949, she was made an honorary member of the historically black organization Alpha Kappa Alpha. She resigned from her UN post in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president. She addressed the Democratic National Convention in 1952 and 1956. President John F. Kennedy later reappointed her to the United Nations, where she served again from 1961 to 1962, and to the National Advisory Committee of the Peace Corps. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson, proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women.
