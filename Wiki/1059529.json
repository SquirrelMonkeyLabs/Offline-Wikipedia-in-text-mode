 "text": "The WAGR Asg class were a total of 25 ASG steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1944 to 1957. The Asg class were purposefully built for war service in Western Australia during the Second World War, they were part of the government scheme to build Australian Standard Garratts (ASG) for narrow gauge systems that required more motive power. They were not a great success and only provided temporary albeit much- needed relief before the class's own issues became too much. By 1958 all had been withdrawn, scrapped or sold. One that was built for Western Australia but never delivered is preserved and on display in Victoria. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
