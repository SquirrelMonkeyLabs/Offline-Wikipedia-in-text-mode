In 2021, the company got $8.47 million. Thrilling worked with Banana Republic, Ruth E. Carter, and helps movies find old clothes. In 2020, they worked with Zerina Akers to show items from black-owned stores. By 2022, over 900 stores in about 200 cities were on Thrilling. They want to use their money to make their website better. In May 2022, they started selling old home items. == Business model == Thrilling competes with websites like Etsy, Depop, Poshmark, and Tradesy. But unlike them, Thrilling only works with real-life old clothing stores. It doesn't have as many reviews or social media activity as its rivals. ==References== Category:Companies of the United States",
