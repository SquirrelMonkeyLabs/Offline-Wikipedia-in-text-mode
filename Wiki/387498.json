 "text": "In Norse mythology, Nanna is an Aesir goddess and wife of the god Baldur, and mother of Forseti. Nanna's domain and etymological significance is heavily debated by scholars. Nanna notably appears in the story of the death of Baldur, where she dies of grief and is set upon his funeral pyre, and later appears in Hel, where she asks Hermodr to deliver several items to other goddesses in Asgard. Nanna's fate post-Ragnarok is never specified unlike Baldur and Hodr, who are prophesied to return. Nanna appears in works by Saxo Grammaticus, whose work is controversial and often regarded as unfaithful to maintaining mythological canon, despite this, Norse mythology has few sources to draw from, and his work is still vital to understanding how Norse mythology was viewed post-christianity.
