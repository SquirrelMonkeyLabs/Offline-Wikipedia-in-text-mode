In Japan, it was called the Sega Super 32X. In North America, it was called the Sega Genesis 32X. In Europe and Australia, it was called the Sega Mega 32X. The Sega 32X was an unpopular console and had poor sales, mostly due to there being only a handful of games made for it and because it was overshadowed by the Sega Saturn.
