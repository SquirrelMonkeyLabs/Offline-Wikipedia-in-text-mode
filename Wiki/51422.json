It lasted from the 26 May until 4 June 1940. == Battle == The Allied forces were split in two by a German armoured advance to the Channel coast at Calais. The British and French commanders had been taken by surprise at the speed of the advance. The northern part of the army was surrounded In Dunkirk, France, a port on the English Channel. There they made a perimeter and waited for an evacuation. == Evacuation == See the main page: Dunkirk evacuation In the Dunkirk evacuation, over 900 small British ships rescued around 340,000 British, French, and Belgian soldiers from the beaches between 26 May 1940 and 4 June 1940. This was most of the British and about half of the French soldiers who fought in the battle. About 40,000 troops, mostly French, had to stay behind to keep the Germans away during the evacuation. Many of the evacuated French troops landed elsewhere and continued the Battle of France. == Related pages == * Dunkirk evacuation * World War II * Allies of World War II ==References== == Other websites == * WW2DB: Invasion of France and the Low Countries Category:1940 in France Category:1940 events Dunkirk Dunkirk Dunkirk Dunkirk Dunkirk Category:Dunkirk Category:May 1940 events Category:June 1940 events",
