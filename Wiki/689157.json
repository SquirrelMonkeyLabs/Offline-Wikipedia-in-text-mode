 "text": "The Yoke and the Bundle of Arrows or the Yoke and Arrows (el Yugo y el haz de flechas or el yugo y las flechas) is a badge from the times of the Spanish monarchy of Ferdinand II and Isabella. It represents the unity of the Spanish monarchy and state, and it also promotes the \"heroic virtues of the [Spanish] race\". The Y in yugo stands for Ysabel, as in another spelling of Queen Isabella; and the F in flechas stands for the first letter in King Fernando's name. The yoke also takes inspiration from the legend of the Gordian knot, as well as the motto that comes with it, Tanto monta. The arrows being wrapped together refers to the moral story that claims that, like people, arrows can be easily broken one by one, but less so when they are together. In the late 1800s, the yoke and arrows became the political symbol of the Spanish socialist party. After more socialist parties were created and decided to use different icons, the fascist Falangist party began to use the yoke and arrows.
