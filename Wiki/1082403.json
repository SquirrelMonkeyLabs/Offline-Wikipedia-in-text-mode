She is founder and CEO of Scopio and writer of the HarperCollins book “The Year Time Stopped: The Global Pandemic in Photos”. == Education == Christina completed her bachelor's degree in International affairs from George Washington University, and Master of International Affairs from Columbia University. == Professional career == Christina Hawatmeh's journey began at George Washington University, exploring Facebook groups as a student. In 2014, during her master's program at Columbia University, her innovative approach to the storytelling potential of images on social media gained attention. This led her to develop Artificial intelligence capable of identifying and preserving original images, aiming to move them from social media to a more enduring presence in the real world. Her vision was to distribute these images globally within three minutes of upload, preventing the loss of valuable historical moments buried in the constant flow of social media. Facing challenges and limitations with existing platforms, Christina launched Scopio, a platform allowing users to directly upload and distribute their images. Her goal was to empower individuals globally, providing a space for photo sharing without the need for professional journalism or photography. Through Scopio, she identified global voices on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, establishing a community of individuals sharing images globally. Christina aimed to liberate valuable images from the confines of social media, recognizing their historical significance. To address the limitations and biases of social media algorithms, Christina challenged traditional business practices by creating a marketplace bridging the gap between professional photographers and ordinary individuals. This transformative approach moved beyond the traditional stock photo industry into a new era of photo sharing. Christina's commitment to inclusivity extended beyond entrepreneurship to social justice advocacy, focusing on cultural awareness and race. She emphasized the importance of venture capital in supporting diverse founders and advocated for a more inclusive tech industry embracing underrepresented voices from all backgrounds. == Books == * The Year Time Stopped: The Global Pandemic in Photos, publisher: HarperOne (June 21, 2022), == Awards == Christina has received numerous accolades, including being recognized as one of the \"Top 10 Self-Made Women in 2023\" by MSN, among the \"Top 10 Entrepreneurs to follow\" by NY Finance, and one of the \"Top 10 Influential Women to look out for\" by NYC Journal.
