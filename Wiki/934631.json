 "text": "Squatter's Rights is a 1946 animated short film produced in Technicolor by Walt Disney Productions. The cartoon is about a confrontation between Pluto and Chip and Dale who have taken up residence in Mickey Mouse's hunting shack. It was the 119th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the only one produced that year. The film was directed by Jack Hannah and features the voices of Dessie Flynn as Chip and Dale, and Pinto Colvig as Pluto.In Squatter's Rights Colvig provides a very rare case of Pluto actually speaking. When Mickey asks \"You wanna build a fire, don't ya?\" Pluto responds \"Yeah!\" Mickey Mouse was voiced by both Walt Disney and Jimmy MacDonald, the latter making his debut as Mickey; he would go on to provide Mickey's voice for over 30 years.It was not, however, the last time Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney. Disney again partly voiced Mickey in Fun and Fancy Free and later in The Mickey Mouse Club. It was also Mickey's first post-war appearance.Squatter's Rights at the Big Cartoon DataBaseSquatter's Rights at The Encyclopedia of Animated Disney Shorts Some scenes featured recycled Mickey Mouse animation from the 1939 short The Pointer, with new animation for Mickey almost entirely provided by Paul Murry, who is now largely known for his time as a Disney comic book artist. Squatter's Rights was released to theaters on June 7, 1946 by RKO Radio Pictures. In 1947, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 19th Academy Awards, but ultimately lost to The Cat Concerto, an MGM Tom and Jerry film, which shared one of 7 Oscars for the Tom and Jerry series. ==Voice actors== *Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney *Pluto: Pinto Colvig *Chip and Dale: unknown ==Production== Production for Squatter's Rights began in the spring of 1944, and finished by January 1946 upon the completion of the short film's Technicolor photography. ==Releases== *1946 - theatrical release *1955 - Disneyland, episode #2.5: \"Adventures of Mickey Mouse\" (TV) *1975 - \"Walt Disney's Cartoon Carousel\" (TV) *c. 1992 - Mickey's Mouse Tracks, episode #72 (TV) *1997 - The Ink and Paint Club, episode #1.5: \"Chip 'n' Dale\" (TV) ==Home media== The short was released on December 7, 2004 on Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Pluto: 1930-1947.
