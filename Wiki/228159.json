On March 17, 2012 it was announced that it would undergo restorations to its infrastructure. These renovations and restorations would be completed in time for Pope Francis' September 2015 visit. It included among other things, a full renovation of the rectory and minor renovations to the Cardinal’s residence. The iconic facility serves as the center of the clergy’s religious life and this includes a library, meeting spaces, public outreach areas, a commercial kitchen and residences for the priests. This project included the full renovation of the living quarters, which included replacement of the windows, roof, elevator, fire protection systems, life safety systems, HVAC systems and all infrastructure, as well as the restoration of the historic interior finishes.
