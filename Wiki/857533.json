 "text": "Organic acid is a type of organic compound that typically has acidic properties. A common example of organic acids are called carboxyl acids, which are generally known as weak acids and do not totally dissociate in a medium such as water, unlike with strong minerals. The simplest form of organic acids, such as acetic and formic, are typically used in stimulation treatments against corrosion for gas and oil, since these are less reactive compared to hydrochloric acid and other strong acids. == References == Category:Acids Category:Organic compounds",
