 "text": "Charamadoye was a king of Nobatia who reigned around CE 410/420. == Biography == He’s known only from an inscription he had placed on the Mandulis temple in Kalabsha in Lower Nubia, which is the final known inscription in Meroitic. The content of the inscription is barely comprehensible, but at least one can currently understand that Charamadoye called himself king -qore. Furthermore, a victory over a king Yismeniye is probably recorded. This ruler may have been the king of the Blemmyians, known from other sources as Isemne. The political situation in Nubia after the fall of the Meroitic Empire remains completely unclear, but we know from ancient sources that the Blemmyes, who previously ruled only in the desert, managed to conquer Lower Nubian cities and establish a kingdom in Lower Nubia. At the same time, the kingdom of Nobatia emerged just south, probably as the successor state to the Meroites, and was apparently in constant conflict with the Blemmyes. == Literature == * Derek A.
