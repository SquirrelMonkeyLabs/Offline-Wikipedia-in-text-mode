 "text": "The Chartreux is a breed of French cat. It is a very intelligent breed, devoted to its owners, patient, non-belligerent, and independent. It is also known as a calm and reserved cat. == History == The Chartreux appears in 16th century French literature. It describes a \"Syrian cat\" with a stocky build, woolly black-gray fur, and copper-colored eyes, which matches the appearance of the Chartreux. It is said that the Chartreux was brought to Europe during the Crusades. The two world wars of the 20th century brought the breed to the brink of extinction, but thanks to the efforts of breeders, it was saved. After World War I, French breeders selected the breeds that most closely resembled the Chartreux and crossbred them with it. By 1928, the breed was once again appearing in European cat shows, but World War II decimated France's native blue cat population. In the United States, the Chartreux was introduced in the 1970s. == Name Origin == There are two theories as to the origin of the name. The French Carthusian monks developed a liqueur called \"Chartreuse,\" which is where the name \"Chartreuse\" comes from, or the name was given to a Spanish fleece in the early 18th century because of its resemblance to wool. == Appearance == Chartreux has an unusually proportionate body shape for a cat. Their body type is semi-coby and they are quite large. Its head is broad and rounded, with small to medium-sized ears that sit on top of its head, just inside the edges. It has a sturdy body and slender legs. The eyes are large and round, and their color is mostly copper, but they can also have gold and yellow tints. Their bluish fur is short and dense, with a woolly coat that has a soft, silky texture. Their coat color belongs to the monochromatic section of the Traditional category, and while any shade of blue is acceptable, a silvery tinge is most desirable. == References == == Other websites == * FBRL Breed Page: Abyssinian Category:Natural cat breeds",
