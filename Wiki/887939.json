 "text": "Photonics is the science of and technology using photons, the fundamental particle of light. The word's etymology comes from the Greek word \"phos\", meaning light, and the suffix \"-ics\", meaning 'matters relevant to'. The etymology is similar to that of the field of Electronics, in which electrons are the main physical particle used in the science and technology. Photonics technologies respond to the needs of humankind by providing access to information, promoting sustainable development, and increasing societal health and well-being. It has many applications across medicine, communications, entertainment and culture. In recognition of this, UNESCO proclaimed 2015 the International Year of Light and since 2018, 16 May the International Day of Light. ==References== Category:Light",
