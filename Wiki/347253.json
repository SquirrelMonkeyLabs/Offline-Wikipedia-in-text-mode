It is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It feeds by hopping on the ground, turning dead leaves over in search of insects. It uses its long bill to do this, and never picks the leaves up.Tostain, O. & J. Dujardin (1988) \"Nesting of the Wing-Banded Antbird and the Thrush-like Antpitta in French Guiana\".
