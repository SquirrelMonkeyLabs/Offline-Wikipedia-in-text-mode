 "text": "Apple Jacks is a type of breakfast cereal made by the cereal maker Kellogg's. It has the flavor of apples and cinnamon. The cereal was invented by William Thilly and was introduced in 1965 as \"Apple O's\". Kellogg's Apple Jacks introduced \"Cinnamon Jacks\", a multi-grain cinnamon flavored cereal in 2013. == Advertising == The first Apple Jacks mascot in the 1960s was \"Apple Guy\", a figure made from cutting a face onto an apple and applying a hat and pieces of cereal for eyes. In the late 60s the box related an \"Apple Car\" with pieces of cereal for wheels. This campaign retired around 6 years later in 1971. ==References== == Other websites == *Apple Jacks on kelloggs.com *Cinnamon Jacks website Category:Breakfast cereals",
