 "text": "Afrikaner nationalism (Afrikaans: Afrikanernasionalisme) is an ethnonationalist ideology originated in 19th-century South Africa among a White South African ethnic group called the Afrikaners, who descended from Dutch settlers. * * * * * ==Overview== Afrikaner nationalism is the idea that Afrikaners are the chosen people and that Afrikaners who speak their language should unite to fight off foreign influences from Jews, English-speaking White settlers of South Africa, Black people and Indian people. ==Popularity== A major proponent of the ideology was the secret group, Broederbond and the National Party (NP) that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994. Other groups that supported the Afrikaner nationalist ideology included but not limited to the Federation of Afrikaans Cultural Organisations (Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurvereniginge , FAK), the Institute for Christian National Education (NE) and the White Workers' Protection Association (WWPA). ==Academic views== The historian T. Dunbar Moodie described Afrikaner nationalism as a type of civil religion that had combined the history of the Afrikaners, their language and Afrikaner Calvinism as key symbols. ==References== Category:Racism Category:Nationalism Category:South Africa Category:Political movements Category:Politics of South Africa Category:19th century in South Africa",
