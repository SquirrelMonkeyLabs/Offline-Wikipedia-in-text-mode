The fixtures were released on Tuesday, 18 June at 09:00 BST. This season will have 33 weekend rounds, four midweek rounds, and one bank holiday matchweek. The summer transfer window opened on Friday, 14 June 2024, and will close at 23:00 BST on Friday, 30 August 2024. The winter transfer window will open on Wednesday, 1 January 2025, and close at 23:00 on Monday, 3 February 2025.
