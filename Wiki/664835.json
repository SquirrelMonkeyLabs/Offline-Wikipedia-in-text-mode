 "text": "The 2018 World Series was the 114th edition of the World Series and featured the American League champion Red Sox and the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Series was televised in the United States on Fox. This was the second World Series match-up between the two teams, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in 1916. The Red Sox beat the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to 2004, and their ninth in franchise history. Steve Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while Alex Cora became the fifth first-season manager, and first manager from Puerto Rico, to win the World Series. The Series was notable for its third game which lasted 18 innings, a new World Series record. ==References== World Category:World Series",
