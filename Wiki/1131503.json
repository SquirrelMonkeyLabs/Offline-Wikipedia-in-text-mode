 "text": "itch.io (stylized in all lowercase) is a website for users to host, sell, and download indie games. The site was created by Leaf Corcoran, the service hosts over 700,000 products as of April 2023. itch.io also allows its users to host game jams, which are events where participants have a limited amount of time (usually 1-3 days) to create games. Itch.io also allows multiple users to sell their products together in \"bundles\". == Income == Developers can charge money for the games they upload to the platform. In May 2015 alone, itch.io paid out $51,489 to developers. By default, the site takes a 10% commission on each sale; but the developer can choose how much money the site receives per purchase. The developer can set a minimum price for the game, including free, and if the customer likes the game they purchased, they can pay more than this minimum amount. In 2021 and 2022, Itch.io ran a Queer Games Bundle during Pride Month to raise money cooperatively for game developers and zine makers. The 2022 version contained more than 500 items and raised US$216,000 for 431 creators even though it had a \"pay what you want\" option. == References == == Other websites == * itch.io Category:Video game websites",
