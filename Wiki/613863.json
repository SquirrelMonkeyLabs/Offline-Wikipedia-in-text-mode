Steatopygia is an inherited phenotype not a condition of the Khoisan peoples also pygymy of southern Africa and central africa . Steotopygia is a phenotype african people kept from ancient humans that was not removed by any selection pressures. Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan in The Descent of Man in 1882, commenting that their steatopygia evolved through sexual selection in human evolution, and that \"the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner\". It also causes inflamation to the genetal area in both male and females the labia minora and labia . Also a infantile face larger breast in both male and female .An increase in gigantomstia in women and a increase in ginocomasti in men . It also improves general athletism in both males and females.Its not only soley found in all khoisan and pygymy people but also bantu speaking people without any archaic eurasian DNA exampes are shona, venda, kalanga, sotho, hutu, nambaya, xhosa, ndebele, ndau , tonga, chichewa and many more. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7976762/ ==What Causes Steotopygia== === General === Steotopygia appearance relies on the combination of the relationship between the femur and the android pelvis only with inclusion of various fat genes that give various proportions to Steotopygia. The phenotype is what african populations subraces like the pygymy , sanbushman , hadza etc.... kept from ancient humans. The austranisians like the andamanese where able to keep steotopygia due to the fact they didn't intermarry with archaic eurasian peoples \" hominid groups who where similar to homoneanderthalis and homo devonian \" they where cut of from the rest of the asian continent after the last glacial maximum just before the dawn of farming. Ancient humans where hard to sexually differentiate from meaning both men and women would show the same morphological phenotypes. It's only when fat became a more prominent sexual diformarism molecule about 150 000 years ago homo sapien males and females where more destuiguishable African male have a triangle shape figure same with african female but with the main difference being females who have gone through puberty showing a higher proportion to fat accumulation in the hips, butt and thighs hence steotopygia is more prevelent \"visualy\" in females who have gone through puberty . Steotopygia shows on both male and female mentioned above regardless of BMI that means even when severely underweight steotopygia still expresses itself usually resulting in a default triangle shape. The reason to this triangle shape is due to the fact the overall African male and female skeleton look more triangular in the front then a android looking at them from the back this was the same with ancient humans . Steotopygia shelfing of the buttocks region is due to the posterior planar structure of the android pelvis that causes a table like or some might say \"shelf like\" appearance . This \"shelfing of the gluteus region\" becomes more pronounced universally when underweight and follows with what looks like a sinking depression but it is also common in people with a healthy BMI but mainly all relies on heredity genetics. Steotopygia is also expressive in children both genders male and female who have not went through puberty even in infants . References [1] C.-M. Oh, J.H. Park, H.S. Chung, J.M. Yu, W. Chung, J.G.

Kaleebu Complimentary methods for multivariate genome-wide association study identify new susceptibility genes for blood cell traits === Anatomy and Genetics === One of the most striking physical characteristics of steatopygia, or accumu lation of adipose tissue on the buttocks. This vast accumulation of fat supported by the deep fascia of the gluteal region. This deep fascia is attached to the external lip of the crest of the ilium and its tubercle, and is associated with the lio-tibial tract. The development of this lip, maybe due to the pull exerted by the deep fascia,of this region which must have been well developed to support the weight of fat. The prominence of this lip, then, nay be regarded as a specialised feature in the Bush female pelvis, and as a characteristic of sexual differentiation in the Bush pelvic elements hence what has been explained above caused the shelfing of the buttocks. Then when it comes to curvilleaner shaped thighs it has been pointed out that in the san bush the acetabulum is shallower, and that it faces more anteriorly than in the Bantu, This latter characteristic is more marked in the Bush female than in the male. eshallowness On the other hand, the acetabulum is more marked in male than in female types. This sexual difference in the depth of the acetabulum would lead to a difference in a position of the superior portion of the femur in male and female types. In the male, it would be slightly displaced laterally. If this lateral displacement were not compensated, the lower parts of the thighs and the knee-joints would be separated, and would not be in their normal anatomical relationship. We have no reason to believe that there was any sexual differentiation in the relation of the knee-joints to one another, and it is probable that none existed. To compensate for a lateral displacement of the femur, the thigh would have to be adducted. In discussing the ischio-pubic ramus in the Bush male, it was stated that the posterior portion of this bar was markedly thickened. From the position of this thickening, it must have been related to the attachments of obturator externus and the anterior portion of adductor magnus. Obturator externus and adductor magnus both adduct the thigh. These muscles, strongly developed, might then eounteract the lateral displace nt of the thigh caused by the shallowness of the male aceta ment bulum. The development of the posterior portion of the ischio pubic ramus may, then, be regarded as a specialised feature of the Bush male pelvis. In the female, since the acetabulum is relatively deeper than that of the male, the lateral displacement of the femur would not be present to the same extent. There would not then be the same necessity for development of the adductor musculature, evidence for which was not found in the Bush female pelvic elements. The second feature with regard to the Bush acetabulum is its position. Theoretically, this anterior facing of the acetabulum would result in the femur being rotated medially, and this tendeney to medial rotation would be present to a greater extent in the Bush female than the male. It has been stated that, in the Bush female, there is a well-marked lip on the inferior border of the ischio-pubic ramus, which must from its position be related to the attachments of adductor brevis and gracilis. These muscles both act as lateral rotators of the thigh. Adductor brevis and gracilis therefore, if strongly developed, as the bony markings indicate, would help in the female to compen sate for the tendeney to position of the ot b rotation of the thigh, caused by the This bony development of the ischio-pubic ramus in the female, then, must be regarded as a compensatory specialisation. In the male, however, the acetabulum also faces more anteriorly than in higher races. There is no evidence that adduc or brevis and gracilis v tor lis were specifically developed muscles in the male as in the female, to counteract the tendency to medial rotation of the thigh. Adduetor brevis and gracilis are not powerful muscles, and it is possible that their greater develop ment in the female was only partially compensatory, to counter act the greater tendency to medial rotation of the thigh in that sex. The first procedure in flexion of the knee-joint is medial rotation of the femur. If the femur were rotated medially, as the position of the acetabulum suggests, the knee-joint would have been in a position of slight flexion and the Bushman would have walked with bent knees. Mr. J. J. Prag, of the Depart ment of Anatomy, in unpublished work on the lower extremity of the Bushman, has proved that the knee-joint was fully extended. There must, therefore, have been some compensatory mechanism to rotate the thigh laterally indicates firstly that the average angle of torsion of the femur in the Bush is 21-50, o high figure compared with 150 in the Bantu. Thís means that in the san Bushman, in comparison with the Bantu, the shaft the femur is rotated laterally upon its head. Secondly, from prominence of muscular markings, that the lateral rotatory musculature of the thigh, piriformis, obturator externus and internus, gemellus superior and inferior, and quad ratus femoris, were probably strongly developed muscles. The combination of these two factors would result in a strong ten deney to lateral rotation of the femur, obviously a compensatory specialisation to counteract the tendeney to medial rotation caused by the position of the acetabuum The tion fore, was apparently in incapable of position of his acetabulum, but he was capable of developing secondary specialisations to allow of his extending his knee-joint as the knee-joint of higher races is extended. It must be admitted that this discussion on the acetabulum is purely hypothetical. Since palaeontological compara tive anatomists apply this method of interpretation of bony pro minences relative to muscular development. In the Bush pelvis, then, we have an intimate admixture of ancient human and specialised features. Speaking generally, the ancient human features are more prominent in female than in male Bush types, but in both sexes there appears to be a great capacity for development of secondary specialisations in accordance with the needs of their mode of life. It seems impossible to say why the ancient human characteristics of the pelvis should be more prominent in the San Bush female than The male Why should the the superior aperture of the true pelvis be markedly more ancient human like in the female? The answer is it may have been a secondary adaptation to the function of child bearing, but in other pelvis shapes such a android dolichopellic pelvis would cause great obstetrical difficulty, might even render normal births impossible. The possibility that this feature may have been responsible for high infantile and maternal mortality, may even have been an important and should not be overlooked by todays pediatrics as a possible cause. The android pelvis in sanbushman is higher and narrower than the android pelvis found in southern bantu speakers. The acetabulum is relativey shallow in the san Bushman and faces more anteriorly than with other pelvis shapes .This feature is more marked in the Bush man female than the male also bantu. The position of the actabulum in the San Bushmen is therefore a ancient human feature,The superior aperture of the pelvie brim is markedly dolicho pellic, that is, it is more ancient human . This condition of dolichopelly is more marked in Where higher Bush females than males, same goes for the bantu . The Bush bones are, however, very massive in Proportion to their size. Prominences . The Bush os coxae is relatively long and narrow in compari son with that of the Bantu. The anterior fossa is markedly narrowed medio-laterally. The two limbs of the Bush auricular surface meet at an obtuse angle, whereas in the Bantu they meet at approximately a right angle. Again, in the Bush there is frequently a constriction of the lower limb which may be a ancient human manifestation. In the Bush the sexual difference in a position of this surface is very marked, while in the Bantu this is not apparent, The sciatic notch extends less deeply into the bone in the Bush than in the Bantu. In the san Bushmen there is a marked aterentiation in in the ischio-pubic ramus also present in bantu males the posterior portion of this bar is thickened medio-laterally. This thickening is apparently related to the attachment of adductor magnus and obturator externus. In females, there is a lateral projection of the bar at the meeting point of the anterior third and posterior two-thirds of the lower border of the obturator foramen. This must be related to the attachments of adductor brevis and, more particularly, gracilis. This must be a specialised feature and will be discussed later. The sexual difference in the shape of the obturator foramen is very much more marked in the san Bushman and the Bantu. The body of the pubis is considerably broader and longer in female Bush types than in males. This difference may be present in Bantu but is neither so obvious nor so constant as in the Bush. mid-point between the spines; in the female it is above it. The posterior iliac spines are more prominent in the male, and a shallow concavity is present between them. No such concavity is seen in the female. The area of attachment of gluteus maxi mus is somewhat larger and better defined in the female, owing to a lateral extension of this area on to the blade of the iliac hence causes a depression more expressive when individual is underweight . The -pectineal eminence is better marked in the male . The sciatic notch is very much wider in the female. The Auricular Surfuce of the female aurieular surface (broken outline) upon the male (con tinuous ). From this diagram it apparent that the male san Bushmen auricular surface tends to be slightly larger than the female. The auricular surface of the female, in comparison with that of the male, is situated considerably higher in relation to the hori The portion of the internal aspect of the il the posthoNe by the lower border limb area of the auricular surface, and below by the superior border of the sciatic notch, is therefore greater in the female, where8s the area between the upper border of the horizontal limb and the posterior part of the crest of the ilium is greater in the male. In the Bantu, there is no difference in the position of the male and female auricular surfaces. The angle at which the two limbs meet is slightly less obtuse in the female. Further in three female specimens there is a constriction of the horizontal limb approximately half- way along the superior border of this limb. A comparable constriction is present in only two male specimens, and here it is less marked and variable in position. The pre-auricular notch is deeper in females than in males. Ischium.-The isclıial spine is better developed in males. In males, it is triangular in shape with a pointed apex; in females it is more rounded. The ischial tuberosity is more prominent in males, and areas muscular attachment on are better demar cated. In females such areas are usually not discernible. The sex differences in the ischio-pubic Plbic been noted. To recapitulate, in males, there is a marked medio-lateral thickening of the posterior portion of this bar ; in fermales there is a lateral projection at the meeting point of the anterior third and posterior two-thirds of the lower border of the obturator foramen. Sex differences in the Bantu pelvis and San Bushmen, as has already been pointed out, may be very prominent or completely absent, so much so that some known female Bantu pelvis, even on detailed examination, closely resemble the android male type. When the two types can be differentiated, the differences are as following: -In the female the obturator foramen is slightly higher in proportion to its length; the sub-pubic angle is wider; muscular areas are not so well marked; the sciatic notch is wider; and the horizontal limb of the auricular surface is shorter. A description of the European gynocoid pelvis may be found in any standard text book of anatomy. Since it differs mainly in detail from the android Bantu pelvis, and android san Bushman Pelvis. The term android when describing the male pelvis is very generalised term used instead the word androgen in medical andro meaning male in greek and gen pelvis in greek is a proper way to describe any male pelvis when it comes to medical terminology should not be confused with the san bushmen and bantu pelvis present in both male and female people this also goes for other people like the nilote, pygmy, sandawe, hadza , andamanese, philipino negrito( out dated race terminology) who also express steotopygia. Genetics of fat genes and how humans gain weight due to sexual diformarism in all human beings is the same like discussed above the only difference is how fat and muscle will distribute around a pelvis type like the sanbushman android pelvis and bantu android pelvis in both male and female again this also goes for other groups of people who express steotopygia. When talking about fat genes in all human beings and sexual diformarism its the same for all human beings. With all human females the generalised form of fat gain is called gynecoid fat distribution where ostrogens with target orgarns ovaries and uterus fat is gained around the hips, thighs and butt. Gynocoid fat distribution though taking it's name from the gynecoid pelvis should not be confused \" Gynocoid fat distribution\" is another generalised terminology should not be confused when talking about sexual diformarism same goes for men due to testosterone its target organs the testes fat will gain around the stomarch area this is called \"android fat distribution\" . === Body Shape And Image === Steotopygia always expresses itself as a spoon or triangle shape by default but that can change as in the realm of medical science humans fall into three body builds ectomorph, mesomorph and or endormorph. The appearance of steotopygia stays constant consistent regardless of BMI but when it comes to overall body shape perceived or categorised by humans which isn't canon medical scientifict you can have steotopygia and be any body shape except for rectangle and apple since it's always bottom heavy around the thighs and buttocks that goes for both male or female this can be any from inverted triangle common with gymnastic athletes, body builders, field athletes rugby stars for both male and female, spoon shape/ pear/ triangle sprinters, long distance ,runners, long jump for both male and female , in common cases only for women with larger breast a hourglass figure . === conclusion summary === Steotopygia is the result of how fat and muscle distribute around the android pelvis and femur in san bushman and bantu male and females this also goes for all groups who express steotopygia. Outdated rascist and uncanon theories of what causes steotopygia and its beautiful shape can finaly be put to rest from rascist cadwell-moloy to the theory of a diformation called lordossis or consuming plants that apparently falsely advertised to give steotopygia. Steotopygia is a normal healthy phenotype expressed by people of afrodescent. == References == Category:Human body features Category:Physical anthropology",
