 "text": "A handbra is the practice of covering a woman's breasts, including her nipples and areolas, with one's hands, which would otherwise have been exposed. When arms are used instead, it is called an armbra. A handbra may be used by women to maintain their modesty, or in compliance with censorship guidelines. It is also used in poses for photography. == Related pages == * Toplessness * Modesty * Armbra Category:Breasts Category:Women",
