 "text": "The following is a list of the codes for MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), an in-depth controlled vocabulary and index of journal articles and books in the life sciences. It is a product of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM). The prefixes (C01, A01, etc.) are linked to more specific sub- lists of codes. The medical terms are linked to articles about those topics on the website. Searched terms (your searches) are listed on the website, as well as medical articles for specific or non-specific terms are included with searches. The items are linked (all the same) by: * Tree number(s), which includes the prefix (e.g. A01) and path to the item with the numbers before the item entry number * Unique ID, which starts with D0 (most of the time) * RDF Unique Identifier (ID), which is the hyperlink version of the unique ID * Entry version (name) and entry terms, which are all of the human-readable names that are connected to the entry * NLN Classification # Realistically, MeSH codes (both this list or articles, and sub-lists for prefixes) would show in search results for every medical term that is included in the MeSH database. This would allow medical terms on the page to help find where an item appears (in its parent lists) and what is similar to it, as in those that are close to the entry. The alternate names (which help with navigation and search of the site) are useful for Wikidata, a sister Wiki project. Each entry on the lists of MeSH codes has a link to the NLN_NIH website item for the entry. MeSH entries can be linked to using any of the items names or identifiers. The source for this content is the set of 2024 MeSH Trees from NLM. * A Anatomy ** A01 body regions (74 articles) ** A02 musculoskeletal system (213 articles) ** A03 digestive system (98 articles) ** A04 respiratory system (46 articles) ** A05 urogenital system (87 articles) ** A06 endocrine system ** A07 cardiovascular system ** A08 nervous system ** A09 sense organs ** A10 tissues ** A11 cells ** A12 fluids and secretions ** A13 animal structures ** A14 stomatognathic system ** A15 hemic and immune systems ** A16 embryonic structures ** A17 integumentary system ** A18plant structures ** A19fungal structures ** A20bacterial structures ** A21viral structures * B Organisms ** B01 eukaryota (animals, plants, fungi) ** B02 archaea ** B03 bacteria ** B04 viruses ** B05 organism forms * C Diseases ** C01 bacterial infections and mycoses ** C02 virus diseases ** C03 parasitic diseases ** C04 neoplasms ** C05 musculoskeletal diseases ** C06 digestive system diseases ** C07 stomatognathic diseases ** C08 respiratory tract diseases ** C09 otorhinolaryngologic diseases ** C10 nervous system diseases ** C11 eye diseases ** C12 urologic and male genital diseases ** C13 female genital diseases and pregnancy complications ** C14 cardiovascular diseases ** C15 hemic and lymphatic diseases ** C16 congenital, hereditary, and neonatal diseases and abnormalities ** C17 skin and connective tissue diseases ** C18 nutritional and metabolic diseases ** C19 endocrine system diseases ** C20 immune system diseases ** C21 disorders of environmental origin ** C22 animal diseases ** C23 pathological conditions, signs and symptoms ** C24occupational diseases ** C25chemically induced disorders ** C26wounds and injuries * D Chemicals and Drugs ** D01 inorganic chemicals ** D02 organic chemicals ** D03 heterocyclic compounds ** D04 polycyclic compounds ** D05 macromolecular substances ** D06 hormones, hormone substitutes, and hormone antagonists ** D07 none (enzymes and coenzymes) ** D08 enzymes and coenzymes (carbohydrates) ** D09 carbohydrates (lipids) ** D10 lipids (amino acids, peptides, and proteins) ** D11 none (nucleic acids, nucleotides, and nucleosides) ** D12 amino acids, peptides, and proteins ** D13 nucleic acids, nucleotides, and nucleosides ** D20 complex mixtures ** D23 biological factors ** D25 biomedical and dental materials ** D26 pharmaceutical preparations ** D27 chemical actions and uses * E Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment ** E01 diagnosis ** E02 therapeutics ** E03 anesthesia and analgesia ** E04 surgical procedures, operative ** E05 investigative techniques ** E06 dentistry ** E07 equipment and supplies * F Psychiatry and Psychology ** F01 behavior and behavior mechanisms ** F02 psychological phenomena and processes ** F03 mental disorders ** F04 behavioral disciplines and activities * G Phenomena and Processes ** G01 physical phenomena ** G02 chemical phenomena ** G03 metabolism ** G04 cell phenomena and immunity ** G05 genetic phenomena ** G06 microbiological phenomena ** G07 physiological processes ** G08 reproductive and urinary physiological phenomena ** G09 circulatory and respiratory physiological phenomena ** G10 digestive and oral physiological phenomena ** G11 musculoskeletal and neural physiological phenomena ** G12 immune system phenomena ** G13 integumentary system physiological phenomena ** G14 ocular physiological phenomena ** G15plant physiological phenomena ** G16biological phenomena ** G17mathematical concepts * HDisciplines and Occupations ** H01 natural science disciplines ** H02health occupations * I Anthropology, Education, Sociology and Social Phenomena ** I01 social sciences ** I02 education ** I03 human activities * J Technology and Food and Beverages ** J01 technology, industry, and agriculture ** J02 food and beverages ** J03 non- medical public and private facilities * K Humanities ** K01 humanities * L Information Science ** L01 information science * M Persons ** M01 persons * N Healthcare ** N01 population characteristics ** N02 healthcare facilities, manpower, and services ** N03 healthcare economics and organizations ** N04 health services administration ** N05 health care quality, access, and evaluation ** N06 environment and public health * V Publication Characteristics ** V01 publication components (publication type) ** V02 publication formats (publication type) ** V03 study characteristics (publication type) ** V04 support of research * Z Geographic Locations ** Z01 geographic locations ==References== 1",
