 "text": "The Indiana Bell Telephone Company is a telecommunications company in the U.S. state of Indiana. The company was established in 1920. It does business under the name AT&T; Indiana. The headquarters of Indiana Bell are in Indianapolis, Indiana. Following the Bell System being dissolved in early 1984, Indiana Bell was owned by Ameritech until late 2002. Beginning in early 1993, the Indiana Bell name was dropped. The name Ameritech started being used instead. In late 2002 or early 2003, Indiana Bell was renamed SBC Indiana after the Ameritech name stopped being used. Three years later in 2006 (following the merger of BellSouth and AT&T;), the Indiana Bell began doing business as AT&T; Indiana. ==References== Category:1920 establishments in the United States Category:History of Indiana Category:American telephone companies",
