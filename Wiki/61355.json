It is the third biggest city in the country. The city is also the capital of the Dodoma region. The city has a population of 410,956 people. The name Dodoma means \"It has sunk\". ==History== During German colonial rule in East Africa, the town of Dodoma was founded at the same time as the creation of the Tanzanian central railway. The British took over the city after World War I. Dodoma became an administrative center for the region until the independence of Tanzania in 1964. In 1973, plans were made to move the capital from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma. Tanzania's National Assembly moved there the next year. Many government offices are still in Dar es Salaam. == Other websites == * Dodoma Region Category:Cities in Tanzania Category:National capitals in Africa",
