It is the sixth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and the eleventh instalment overall. Set in the fictional Liberty City, based on New York City, the single-player story follows Russian war veteran Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from high-profile criminals. The open world lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands, and the neighbouring state of Alderney, which is based on New Jersey. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in 2013. == Gameplay == Grand Theft Auto IV has the same basic gameplay from the earlier games in the series.
