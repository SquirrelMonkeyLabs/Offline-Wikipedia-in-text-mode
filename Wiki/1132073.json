 "text": "Baron of Otford, in the County of Kent, is a dormant title in the English baronage, created in 791 for the Archbishops of Canterbury. The title was important for religious and military reasons since Anglo-Saxon times. It is over 1,200 years old. == History == The title began in 791 when King Offa of Mercia gave the barony to the bishop and the Church of Canterbury. This occurred after King Offa defeated the Kentish king Aldric in battle at Otford. For many centuries after that, the Archbishop of Canterbury owned the barony. Otford became an important property, listed as a village in the 1086 Domesday Book with lands, mills, and people who paid rent. Many archbishops lived there, making it a significant place for both political and religious leaders in medieval England. Famous religious leaders connected to Otford include St. Anselm, St. Thomas Becket, Cardinal Stephen Langton, and Simon Sudbury. In the 13th century, Otford experienced damage during wars between the king and opposing nobles. To address this, workers repaired and strengthened the property in the early 14th century. The Archbishop's Palace at Otford (Otford Palace) reached its peak condition in the 16th century under Archbishops Henry Deane and William Warham, who expanded and beautified it. In 1537, King Henry VIII required Archbishop Thomas Cranmer to give Otford to the Crown, creating the Honor of Otford as part of the royal lands. The Honor of Otford remained with the Crown for hundreds of years, managed by various individuals, including Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who was favoured by Queen Elizabeth I. In 1650, during the Commonwealth period, the government granted the barony to someone once again. However, when the monarchy returned in 1660, these grants were canceled, and the barony reverted to the Crown, remaining unused for many years. In 1806, King George III bestowed the barony upon William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst, a notable diplomat and colonial administrator. Subsequent Lords Amherst continued to hold the barony as one of their secondary titles until the end of the 19th century. == Barons of Otford (791) == * Werhard, 1st Baron of Otford (unknown–830) (dormant until 1070) * Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, 2nd Baron of Otford (c. 1005–1089) * Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, 3rd Baron of Otford (c. 1033–1109) * Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, 4th Baron of Otford (c. 1119–1170) * Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, 5th Baron of Otford (c. 1150–1228) * Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, 6th Baron of Otford (c. 1316–1381) * Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, 7th Baron of Otford (c. 1353–1414) * William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, 8th Baron of Otford (c. 1450–1532) * Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, 9th Baron of Otford (1489–1556) (dormant until 1650) * Edward Sexby and Samuel Clerke, 10th Barons of Otford (Sexby: 1613–1658) (dormant until 1806) * William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst, 11th Baron of Otford (1773–1857) * William Pitt Amherst, 2nd Earl Amherst, 12th Baron of Otford (1805–1886) * William Archer Amherst, 3rd Earl Amherst, 13th Baron of Otford (1836–1910) * Sir Herbert Cohen, 14th Baron of Otford (1874–1968) * Joyce Waley-Cohen, Lady Waley-Cohen, 15th Baroness of Otford (1920–2013) * , 16th Baroness of Otford (born 1951) * John Hornchurch, 17th Baron of Otford (?) * Dormant Currently, the Otford Foundation holds the title in dormancy.
