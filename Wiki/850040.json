 "text": "The \"Mexican National Anthem\" (), also known by its opening line \"Mexicans, at the cry of war\" (Spanish: Mexicanos, al grito de guerra), is the national anthem of Mexico. The anthem was first used in 1854. Later, in 1854, he asked Jaime Nunó to compose the music which now accompanies González's poem. The national anthem, consisting of ten stanzas and a chorus, effectively entered into use on September 16, 1854. == Lyrics == === Spanish original === Spanish original IPA transcription English translation Mexicans, at the cry of war, assemble the steel and the bridle, 𝄆 and the Earth trembles to its core to the resounding roar of the cannon. 𝄇 I Encircle Oh Fatherland!, your temples with olives peace by the divine archangel, for in heaven your eternal destiny by the finger of God it was written. If, however, a foreign enemy would dare to profane Your ground with their sole, think, Oh beloved Fatherland!, that Heaven 𝄆 has given a soldier in every son. 𝄇 V War, war! with no mercy to any who shall try to tarnish the coats of arms of the Fatherland! War, war! The national banners Shall be drenched in the waves of blood. War, war! On the mountain, in the valley, The cannons thunder in horrid unison and the sonorous echoes resound 𝄆 with bellows of Union! Liberty! 𝄇 VI O, Fatherland, if however your children, defenceless With their necks bent beneath the yoke, May your fields be watered with blood, May their footsteps be printed with blood. And your temples, palaces and towers Shall collapse with horrid clamour, And your ruins continue on, whispering: 𝄆 Of one thousand heroes, the Fatherland once was. 𝄇 X Fatherland! Fatherland! Your children assure to breathe until their last for your sake, if the bugle with its bellicose accent calls them together to battle with courage. For you, the olive wreaths! For them, a reminder of glory! For you, a laurel of victory! 𝄆 For them, a tomb of honour! 𝄇 ===In indigenous languages=== Nahuatl translation Maya translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=TWkmdGUFn5ynqJZG&v;=_U_- ujR2azY&feature;=youtu.be Mixtec translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xCME0iS7NwY&pp;=ygUZSGltbm8gbWV4aWNhbm8gZW4gbWl4dGVjbw%3D%3D Huastec translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yjBH3iKPY20&pp;=ygUjaGltbm8gbmFjaW9uYWwgbWV4aWNhbm8gZW4gaHVhc3RlY28%3D Chinantec translationhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LmSaSRRIPgg == References == Category:1850s songs Category:National symbols of Mexico Category:North American anthems",
