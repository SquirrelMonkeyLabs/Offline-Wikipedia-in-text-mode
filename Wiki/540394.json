 "text": "Simei MRT station (EW3) is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East West line in Tampines, Singapore. This station mainly serves Simei, a residential estate which is part of the larger Tampines New Town. ==History== Before the construction of the station, the station was known as Tampines South. The name was changed to Simei in 1985, before the station's opening in 1989. As like other above-ground stations built during the initial construction of the East West line, the station did not have platform screen doors. Following successful trials at Jurong East, Yishun and Pasir Ris stations, half height platform screen doors were installed and started operation on 3 July 2011. High-volume low-speed fans were also installed at the platform in 2011. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:1989 establishments in Singapore",
