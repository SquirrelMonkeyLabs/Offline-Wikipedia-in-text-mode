 "text": "Number theory is a part of mathematics. It explains what some types of numbers are, what properties they have, and ways that they can be useful. Topics in number theory are: * Prime numbers * Factorization * Matrix Important theorems in number theory are: * Chinese remainder theorem * Fundamental theorem of arithmetic * Fermat's last theorem * Fermat's little theorem == Applications == A well-known application of number theory is encrypted messaging (encryption). Data compression also makes use of the field. ==Further reading== * G.H. Hardy; E.M. Wright (2008) [1938]. An introduction to the theory of numbers. Oxford University Press.
