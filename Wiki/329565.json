 "text": "The Battle of Balaclava was a battle of the Crimean War. It was on 25 October 1854 by the Ottoman Empire, the French Empire, and the United Kingdom against the Russian Empire. The battle ended with a Russian victory. Two of the most important events of the Crimean War took place during the Battle of Balaclava. == The Thin Red Line == The 93rd Highland Regiment, which was dressed almost only in red, formed a line that was two men thick and stood its ground despite a charge by the Russian cavalry. == The Charge of the Light Brigade == The charge was made by the 4th and 13th Light Dragoons, 17th Lancers, and the 8th and 11th Hussars, under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan. Many people died in the charge since 278 of the over 670 soldiers were killed. The event inspired the poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, of the same name.
