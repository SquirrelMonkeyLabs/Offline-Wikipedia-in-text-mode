 "text": "The WAGR Pmr class were a total of 16 express steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1950 to 1972. The Pmr class was built in 1949 by the North British Locomotive Coy to almost identical specifications to the standard P class of 1924. They were ordered along with the Pm class, they differed from the aforementioned class in that they had all their wheels fitted with roller bearings, hence Pmr (Pacific Mills Roller-bearings). However like the Pm, due to each set of wheels being independently sprung, they rode roughly which led to their removal from express passenger traffic as they were unable to keep up with the set timetables. Instead, they were placed on express and heavy goods work, where they worked successfully until the end of steam on the WAGR, with withdrawals starting in 1970 and ending in 1972. Four Pmr class locos are preserved, No. 70 is displayed at Steamtown, Peterborough in South Australia after having previously operated excursion trains, No. 721 is displayed at old Northam railway station, No. 729 is displayed at Coolgardie railway station, and No. 735 is in the possession of the Shire of Murray who plans on restoring it for static display in Pinjarra.
