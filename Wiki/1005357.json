 "text": "Ōmononushi () is a god in Japanese mythology who is connected to Mount Miwa in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture. He is closely related to the god Ōkuninushi in the imperial myth cycle, with the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki texts referring to Ōmononushi as either another name for or a spirit of Ōkuninushi. Ōmononushi is mainly worshipped at Ōmiwa Shrine located at the base of Mount Miwa. This mountain is considered the shrine's sacred object of worship. Ōmononushi is also known as Miwa-no-Ōkami or Miwa (Dai)myōjin. He is also worshipped at Ōsugi Shrine in Ibaraki Prefecture, and is identified with Konpira Daigongen, the deity of Kotohira Shrine in Kagawa Prefecture. == Related pages == * Ōkuninushi * Snake worship * Kotoshironushi == Bibliography == * * Aoki, Michiko Y., tr.
