 "text": "Feminist therapy is an idea about therapy that started in the 1970s. There are different roles for men and women in society. When growing up, children are confronted with what society expects form them as an adult. The people at the time said, that most forms of therapy were developed by men, but the majority of people seeking counseling or therapy are women. Many people believing in feminist therapy say that when a woman undergoes a therapy, this therapy should also take into account that she is a woman. Feminist therapy grew out of concerns that established therapies were not helping women. Specific concerns of feminist therapists included gender bias and stereotyping in therapy; blaming victims of physical abuse and sexual abuse; and the assumption of a traditional nuclear family.
