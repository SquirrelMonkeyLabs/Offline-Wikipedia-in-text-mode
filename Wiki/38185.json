 "text": "Stanley Melbourne Bruce (15 April 1883 â€“ 25 August 1967) was the eighth Prime Minister of Australia from February 1923 until October 1929. He became Prime Minister when the Country Party asked Billy Hughes to resign. His government won elections in 1925 and 1928 but lost the 1929 election and Bruce became the first sitting Prime Minister to lose his seat. He was made a Viscount after he left politics. Bruce was born in Melbourne. He served in the British Army before starting in politics. He fought in World War I, and in 1917 was badly injured while fighting in France. Returning home, he soon became involved in recruiting people for the Army. In 1918, however, he got involved in politics and was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Flinders, which is near Melbourne. He was appointed Treasurer (finance minister) in 1921. Bruce was also a diplomat. He served as Minister for External Affairs whilst also serving as Prime Minister. After resigning from Parliament in 1933, he worked in London as Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. == Other websites == Category:1883 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Prime ministers of Australia Category:Politicians from Melbourne Category:Nationalist Party of Australia politicians Category:United Australia Party politicians Category:Treasurers of Australia Category:Australian ministers for Foreign Affairs Category:Australian military people",
