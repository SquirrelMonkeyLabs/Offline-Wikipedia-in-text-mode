Unluckily, it was soaked in water and the writing vanished. Unhappy with the tragedy, Renggi ate the script and swallowed it. The script became ingrained in Renggi's brain and blood and also his descendants. Since then, the Ibans became master at memorising oral traditions, just like exactly written in books. Occasionally, the Ibans used personalised symbols as memory aids on their writing boards (papan turai). Papan turai was used to record ritual poems such as pengap and sabak. Iban language had no extant writing system of its own. So, Christian missionaries adopted the Latin alphabet to write the language. A Sea Dyak Dictionary, published in 1900, was important in the early development of the Iban as a written language. During the Crown Colony era, the Borneo Literature Bureau also worked on the written form of the Iban language. From 1947 to 1962, Dunging anak Gunggu invented an Iban syllabary. This script is known as the Dunging script.Churchill Edward (20 June 2012). \"'Long Lost' Iban Alphabet Script 'Found'\". The Borneo Post. Retrieved 20 August 2019. In 2010, Dr. Bromeley Philip of Universiti Teknologi MARA created digital fonts for Dunging script, named \"LaserIban\". He is the grandnephew of Dunging. The digital font is available for Windows and Macintosh computers. Dr Bromeley also launched a course to promote the use of LaserIban. He also had transcribed several traditional folktales from Latin alphabet into Dunging script. However, the Dunging script is not widely used. As of 2011, only three people in the world know how to write the Dunging script. They are Dr Bromeley himself, a longhouse chief Tuai Rumah Bagat Nunui and a teacher Ngambong Katoi. == References == == Other website == * Digitized books about Iban at the SOAS library * Ator Sambiang Mass Baru: The Holy Eucharist in Iban (1980) Anglican eucharistic liturgy digitized by Richard Mammana Category:Languages of Indonesia Category:Pages containing links to subscription-only content Category:Articles containing Iban-language text Category:Languages of Malaysia",
