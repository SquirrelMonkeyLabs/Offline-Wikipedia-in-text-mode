 "text": "Lechlade (), or Lechlade-on-Thames, is a town in Cotswolds, Gloucestershire, England. It is named after the River Leach. As of 2011, it has a population of around 2,850. Evidence of human occupation begins during the neolithic, Iron Age and Roman periods. The town later became a trading centre. Lechlade is home to the Anglican Church of St Lawrence which has been there since the 15th century, as well as a Baptist Church on Sherborne Street, there since 1817. In modern times, many cultural and social activities occur around the town's Memorial Hall, which was burned down by a fire and rebuilt in 2016. After World War II, the development of the nearby air force stations, RAF Fairford and RAF Brize Norton, helped expand the town. ==References== Category:Towns in Gloucestershire",
