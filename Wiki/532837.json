The San Francisco politician Harvey Milk fought the measure. California Governor Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter were against it. Polls had originally showed support for the initiative leading by a large margin. It was defeated by the LGBT community, conservatives and liberals alike. ==References== Category:1978 in California Category:LGBT in the United States Category:United States law Category:1970s in law",
