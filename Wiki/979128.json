 "text": "\"Hungry Heart\" is a 1980 song by Bruce Springsteen. It is the leading single from his fifth studio album The River. It went to number 5 in Canada and the United States, number 8 in the Netherlands, number 11 in Austria, number 17 in Sweden, number 24 in New Zealand and number 33 in Australia. ==Track listing== # \"Hungry Heart\" – 3:19 # \"Held Up Without a Gun\" – 1:15 \"Held Up Without a Gun\" is a track from The River sessions that began a Springsteen tradition of using songs that did not appear on his albums as B-sides. A River Tour performance of it is included on The Essential Bruce Springsteen compilation album's optional disc. This was the only live performance of the song in a regular Springsteen concert (apart from rehearsals) until the song reappeared twice during the Magic tour and once during the Wrecking Ball Tour. The studio version remained unavailable on CD until the release of the 2015 box set The Ties That Bind: The River Collection. The cover of the single sleeve shows the Empress Hotel, one of Asbury Park's fading landmarks of the time. ==References== Category:1980 songs Category:Bruce Springsteen songs",
