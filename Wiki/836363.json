 "text": "From 1993 to 2023, Montana was represented in the United States House of Representatives by one at-large congressional district. The district was the most populous U.S. congressional district at the time, with just over 1 million constituents, and the second-largest by land area, after Alaska's at- large congressional district. The district was last represented by Republican Matt Rosendale. Starting in the 2022 midterm elections and after the 2020 United States census, Montana was given the congressional seat that it lost after the 1990 census. It was split up between the 1st district in the west and the 2nd district in the east. ==Election results== ==References== Category:Congressional districts of Montana",
