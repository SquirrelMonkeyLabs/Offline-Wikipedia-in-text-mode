 "text": "The Province of South Carolina (also known as the South Carolina Colony) was originally part of the Province of Carolina in British America. In 1776 the province became the U.S. state of South Carolina. The Carolinas were named for King Charles II of England. The colony was first named \"Carolana\". Charles II had given the land to a group of eight nobles called the Lords Proprietors. In 1712 the Carolina Province split into the Province of North Carolina and Province of South Carolina. Both provinces became British royal colonies in 1729. Lord Charles Montagu (1741-1784) was Royal Governor of the Province of South Carolina from 1766 to 1773. ==References== Category:18th century in South Carolina Sou Category:1712 establishments in the Thirteen Colonies Category:1770s disestablishments in the United States Category:Former colonies in North America",
