In 2001, he presented his last film Badr, which he wrote, produced and directed, and co-starred with Miss Egypt 1999, Angie Abdalla. Mansour is a fan of American action films. He believes the future of Egypt lies in its ability to promote a new face to revive wilting tourism and an unfavorable international image, instead of ancient civilizations and historical treasures. In 2003, it was revealed that he would produce and star in Triple I, an action-packed drama that revolves around a good-looking rescue team of seven women and three men, who will – following the pattern of such adventure-based shows – chase criminals and save lives. \"I loved Baywatch and decided it was a good vehicle to promote many things in modern Egypt, to show beautiful beaches and the reefs, our underwater treasures,\" Mansour said regarding the series. ==Personal life== Mansour has a daughter, Monika Youssef Mansour, who is an athlete and sportswear designer. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Martial artists Category:Actors Category:Producers",
