Ciara was executive producer on the album along with co-executive Mark Pitts and, Ciara worked with several record producers, including Blac Elvis, Benny Blanco, Blade, Jasper Cameron, The Clutch, Darkchild, Danja, Dr. Luke, Jason Nevins, Jim Beanz, Los da Maestro, Ne-Yo, Osinachi Nwaneri, Polow da Don, The-Dream, Tricky Stewart, Justin Timberlake, T-Pain. The album featured several guest appearances from several different R&B; and hip hop artists like Timberlake, Ludacris, Chris Brown, Young Jeezy, The-Dream, Missy Elliott. Musically, Fantasy Ride is a departure from Ciara's crunk sound, which was on her first two albums and features a mixture of R&B;, hip hop and dance music in the album's overall sound. For the album, Ciara created a super hero character called \"Super C\" who \"is a character that people will learn more about on this record. That is my alter ego. Super C doesn't hold back. She is definitely aggressive. She goes hard. Super C can do some magical and funky things. She works hard. She dances to the 10th power. She does everything to the 10th power.\" ==Critical reception== Fantasy Ride received mixed reviews from music critics. ==Track listing== ===Standard editions === === Deluxe editions === === EP version === Notes * signifies a co-producer * signifies a vocal producer * signifies an additional production for remix ==Personnel== * Marcella \"Ms. Lago\" Araica – audio mixing , additional production , recording engineer * Chris Athens – mastering * Jim Beanz – vocal arrangement * Benjamin \"Benny Blanco\" Levin – drums, keyboards, programming, producer * Derek Blanks – photographer * Brandon \"Blade\" Bowles – music producer * Chris Brown – vocals, vocal arrangement * Bernard Chang – illustrations * Aubry Delane – assistant recording engineer * Carlos \"Los da Mystro\" McKinney – music producer * Mike Donaldson – recording engineer, audio mixing * Mike Elizondo – instrumentation * Paul Foley – recording engineer * Yolonda Frederick – make- up * Serban Ghenea – audio mixing * Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald – guitar, drums, keyboards, music programming, production * Tatiana Gottwald – assistant recording engineer * Matty Green – audio mixing assistant * Mariel Haenn – stylist * Christy Hall – production assistant * John Hanes – additional Pro- Tools recording engineer * Kuk Harrell – vocal producer , vocal recording engineer , mixing technician * Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins – music producer, audio mixing, vocal producer * Rob Knox – instrumentation * Giancarlo Lino – audio mixing assistant * Carlton Lynn – recording engineer * Andile Majozi – assistant * Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash – songwriter , co-producer , vocals , vocal arrangement *Candice Nelson – songwriter, vocal arrangement * Jared Newcomb – audio mixing assistant * Osinachi Nwaneri – music producer * Carlos Oyanedel – audio mixing assistant * Dave Pensado – audio mixing * Mark Pitts – executive producer * Jamal \"Polow da Don\" Jones – producer * Ramon Rivas – assistant recording engineer * Tim Roberts – assistant Pro-Tools recording engineer * Todd Rubenstein – assistant recording engineer * Becky Scott – production coordination * Kelly \"Becky 4 Real\" Sheehan – instrumental recording engineer * Vanessa Silberma – production coordination * Gary \"G\" Silver – production coordination * Spike Stent – audio mixing * Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart – music producer * Phil Tan – audio mixing * Faheem \"T-Pain\" Najm – producer * Brian \"B Luv\" Thomas – instrumental recording engineer * Pat Thrall – instrumental recording engineer * Randy Urbanski – audio mixing assistant * Courtney Walter – art direction, design * Elvis \"Blac Elvis\" Williams – producer * Emily Wright – recording engineer, vocal editing * Kiyah Wright – hair stylist * Andrew Wuepper – audio mixing assistant ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Weekly chart performance for Fantasy Ride Chart (2009) Peak position Argentinean Albums (CAPIF) 9 European Top 100 Albums (Billboard) 20 Japanese Albums (Oricon) 18 Polish Albums (ZPAV) 38 UK R&B; Albums (OCC) 2 World Albums Top 40 (Billboard) 4 ===Year-end charts=== Year-end chart performance for Fantasy Ride Chart (2009) Position US Billboard 200 190 US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 51 ==Release history== Release history for Fantasy Ride Region Edition Date Label United Kingdom Standard May 3, 2009 RCA Standard May 4, 2009 Extended May 5, 2009 United States Standard Limited LaFace Canada Standard Limited Sony Music Japan Standard May 13, 2009 Sony Music Japan BrazilFantasy Ride in Brazil .
