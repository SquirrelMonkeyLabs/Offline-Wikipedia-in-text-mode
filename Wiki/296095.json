 "text": "Marsupial moles (Notoryctidae) is a family of marsupials of the order Notoryctemorphia. There are only two extant species: * Notoryctes typhlops (Southern Marsupial Mole) * Notoryctes caurinus (Northern Marsupial Mole) == Description == The two species of marsupial moles are rare and not well understood burrowing mammals of the deserts of Western Australia. Marsupial moles spend most of their time underground, coming to the surface only occasionally, probably mostly after it rains. They are blind, their eyes having become reduced to vestigial lenses under the skin, and they have no external ears, just a pair of tiny holes hidden under thick hair. They do not dig permanent burrows, filling the tunnel in behind them as they move. Category:Marsupials of Australia",
