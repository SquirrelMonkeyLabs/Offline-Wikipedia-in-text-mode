 "text": "The Panguana poison frog (Ameerega panguana) is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in a kind of forest called a purma. It can also live in forests that have never been cut down and forests that were destroyed and are growing back. People have seen it between 200 and 400 meters above sea level. The frog lives in at least four protected places: San Matías–San Carlos Protection Forest, El Sira Communal Reserve, Yánesha Communal Reservation, and a private concession called ACP Panguana. ==Young== The males frog sits on leaves and calls to the female frogs. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to pools of water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. It is in some danger from fires and because human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms for themselves, to get wood to build with, and to make places for cows to eat grass. People do sell this frog as a pet, but scientists say this is not a big danger to the frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
