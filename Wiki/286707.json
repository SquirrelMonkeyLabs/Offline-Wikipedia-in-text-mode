 "text": "Canine teeth are found in mammals. They are the eye teeth, fangs or dogteeth. They are on either side of the incisors. Their main function is to hold food firmly in order to tear it apart, and also attack and defence. In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence. Examples are: wolves and dogs; the cat family; walrus. Baboons and the great apes have large canines, especially the adult males. In humans they are much reduced, and sit in line with the other teeth. Category:Teeth",
