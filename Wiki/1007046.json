The tadpoles swim in paddy fields, holes full of water, ponds, and marshes. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out but it is in some danger because people change the place where it lives: People go into the forest to take things they need. People change the forest into small farms. Dirty chemicals, fires, and changes in the water can also hurt this frog. In some places, people catch this frog to eat or sell as a pet.
