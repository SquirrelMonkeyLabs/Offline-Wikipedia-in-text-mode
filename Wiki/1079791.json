Within the Geely group, the brand positioned itself as a startup- like company by introducing innovative sales models such as direct-to-consumer sales model and subscription model to market its vehicles. Lynk & Co shares its technology such as engine and platform with Volvo and Geely vehicles. == History == Lynk & Co was launched in 2016 with three production models, all based on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) developed by China Euro Vehicle Technology (CEVT) and used also by Volvo, Polestar and Geely. According to Geely designer Peter Horbury, the intention was \"to position it between Volvo and Geely as a so-called 'near premium' brand\". In August 2017, Zhejiang Geely Holding, Geely Automobile Holdings and Volvo Car Group signed an agreement at Geely Auto's Hangzhou Bay R&D; Center to establish the Lynk & Co joint venture. Under this agreement, Geely Auto controls 50% of Lynk & Co, Volvo held 30%, and Zhejiang Geely Holding held the remaining 20%. The first product announced by Lynk & Co was the 01 crossover, the production version first shown at the 2017 Auto Shanghai show. Production of the 01 started in China in 2017, in Volvo's production plant in Luqiao district in the city of Taizhou, China, sharing the same production line as the Volvo XC40 and the Polestar. Since then, Lynk & Co have used three other manufacturing plants. The 02, 02 Hatchback and 03 are manufactured at the Zhangjiakou plant, while the 01, 06, 08 and 09 are manufactured at the Meishan plant 50 km from Ningbo. The 05 and 07 is manufactured at Geely's Luqiao CMA Super Factory. A concept version of the second model, the 03 sedan, was first shown along with the production 01 in Shanghai. The third model, also based on the platform shared with the Volvo XC40, is the 02. Smaller than the 01, it is a hatchback with a crossover-like styling. Lynk & Co had originally planned to launch the Lynk & Co 04 as a compact hatchback, however, by 2020 it was cancelled and the nameplate was devoted to an electric scooter instead. In September 2020, at the Beijing Auto Show, the Lynk & Co Zero concept was revealed to the public. It was expected to be the first fully electric vehicle from Lynk & Co, but instead it became the first model from the new electric vehicle brand, Zeekr, as the Zeekr 001. === Restructuring in 2024 === In November 2024, in response to Geely Holding Group's restructuring strategy, the equity structure of Geely Auto, Zeekr, and Lynk & Co have been further optimized. Geely Holding Group (Geely) announced to transfer its 11.3% stake in Zeekr Intelligent Technology (Zeekr) to Geely Automobile Holdings (Geely Auto). Geely Auto's shareholding ratio in Zeekr increased to 62.8%. Zeekr announced to purchase 20% stake of Lynk & Co from Geely Auto for 3.6 billion yuan and acquire Volvo Car's 30% stake in Lynk & Co for 5.4 billion yuan. This made Zeekr hold 51% of Lynk & Co in total, while the remaining 49% of Lynk & Co shares continues to be held by Geely Auto. == Products == === Current models === * Lynk & Co 01 (2017–present), compact SUV * Lynk & Co 02 (2018–present), compact hatchback/SUV * Lynk & Co 03 (2018–present), compact sedan * Lynk & Co 05 (2019–present), compact coupe SUV * Lynk & Co 06 (2020–present), subcompact SUV * Lynk & Co 07 (2024–present), mid-size sedan * Lynk & Co 08 (2023–present), mid-size SUV * Lynk & Co 09 (2021–present), full-size SUV * Lynk & Co Zero (to commence), mid-size sedan, BEV File:2022_Lynk_&_Co_01_facelift.jpg|Lynk & Co 01 File:Lynk_&_Co_02_Hatchback_003.jpg|Lynk & Co 02 File:Lynk_&_Co_03_facelift_IMG001.jpg|Lynk & Co 03 File:2020_Lynk_&_Co_05_(front).jpg|Lynk & Co 05 File:Lynk & Co 06 EM-P 003.jpg|Lynk & Co 06 EM-P File:Lynk & Co 07 EM-P 001.jpg|Lynk & Co 07 EM-P File:Lynk & Co 08 EM-P 006.jpg|Lynk & Co 08 EM-P File:Lynk_&_Co_09_PHEV_20230308_(cropped).jpg|Lynk & Co 09 ==References== Category:Automobile companies of China",
