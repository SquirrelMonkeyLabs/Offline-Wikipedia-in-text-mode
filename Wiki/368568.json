Fariduddin Ganjshakar is generally recognized as the first major poet of the Punjabi language, and is considered one of the pivotal saints of the Punjab and indeed, one of the Panj Peers, or five main/great saints of South Asia. Revered equally by Muslims and Hindus, he is also considered one of the fifteen Sikh bhagats. Selections from his work are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy scripture. His world-famous shrine is located in Pakpattan, in present-day Punjab (Pakistan). It was built in 1267. Each year during the Islamic month of Muharram, special festivities are held there and pilgrims from many countries come to visit. == References == Category:1179 births Category:1266 deaths Category:Punjabi people Category:Asian Sufis Category:Mystics Category:Pakpattan District",
