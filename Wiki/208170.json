 "text": "A mixed number (also called a mixed fraction) is a number which contains a whole number and a fraction added together. For instance 1 ½, in words \"one and a half\", is the same as 1 + ½, or \"one plus one half.\" It is another way of writing 3/2 or \"three over two\" or \"three halves\", which is an improper fraction. Both ways of writing the number are correct. == Examples == Mixed number in plain text Mixed number in math notation Mixed number in words Equivalent improper fraction Equivalent decimal Picture Picture description 1 1/2 1 \\frac{1}{2} One and a half 3/2 1.5 The picture shows 1 ½ circles shaded in grey. 3 3/4 3 \\frac{3}{4} Three and three quarters 15/4 3.75 The picture shows 3 \\frac{3}{4}circles shaded in grey.",
