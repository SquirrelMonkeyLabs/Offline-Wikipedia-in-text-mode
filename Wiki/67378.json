 "text": "Kinder Scout is a plateau in Derbyshire, England. It is about 600 metres above sea level. It is near Hayfield to the west, Edale to the southeast, and the town of Glossop to the northwest. The gritstone rock under the plateau is covered by a thick layer of peat, cut by a dense network of streams which flow off it. One of the main streams is the Kinder River, which drops off the Western edge at Kinder Downfall. Plants on the plateau are mainly heather, with some mosses and bilberry. Bracken grows on the slopes around the plateau. The highest point is Kinder Low at . It can be approached from the southeast up a steep track called Jacobs Ladder. It is crossed by the Pennine Way long- distance footpath which starts in nearby Edale. Several sections of the path have been surfaced with large stone slabs in this area, to try to reduce environmental damage to the delicate moorland ecosystem by the large number of hikers it attracts all year round. In the 1930s, Kinder Scout was the scene of the first mass trespasses by ramblers on Sunday, 24 April 1932 protesting at the lack of public access to the open moorland in many parts of northern England, which were then kept for grouse shooting by the estates of a number of stately homes. Public rights of way were established later, and the 2000 Countryside and Rights of Way Act set a new legal framework in which the bulk of Kinder Scout is now \"Access Land\" where the public has a right to roam freely. == References == Category:Plateaus Category:Geography of Derbyshire",
