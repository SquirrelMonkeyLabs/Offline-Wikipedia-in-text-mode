 "text": "The Muduga mountain leaping frog (Buergeria muduga) is a frog. It lives in India in the Elivalmalai mountains. People have seen this frog in grassy places and wet places. Scientists think it might live on big farms too but they have not seen it there yet, as of 2023. So far, people have only seen it in one forest, between 800 and 1900 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog's tadpoles do not live in the water and instead move across wet rocks and moss using their tails and their back legs. Their back legs grow on them sooner than other tadpoles' back legs. Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out. They think visitors to the area could hurt this frog. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. Because it lives high in mountains, the frog cannot move north when the weather gets hotter the way other animals could. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can also make this frog sick. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. They think this because they have seen B. dendrobatidis on other species of frogs in the same family. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
