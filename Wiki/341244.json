 "text": "Redonda is a very small Caribbean island. It is part of Antigua and Barbuda,.Government of Antigua and Barbuda Constitution No people live here. This small island is southwest of Antigua. It is between the islands of Nevis and Montserrat. Redonda seems like one very large rock. It is what is left of an ancient volcanic core. The land rises very steeply from sea level, mostly as sheer cliffs. There is no source of freshwater except rain. The only animals that live here are seabirds and a herd of feral goats. The goats live on the poor grazing on top of the island. ==History== Christopher Columbus found Redonda in 1493 on his second journey. He said the island belonged to Spain. He named the island Santa Mar√≠a la Redonda, meaning Saint Mary the Round. The island looks round when viewed from the side. In the 1860s, the island became a British possession. ==References== Category:Geography of Antigua and Barbuda Category:Caribbean islands Category:Uninhabited regions",
