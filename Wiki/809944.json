Articles on EcuRed are written from a Cuban point of view. For example, EcuRed's article about the United States said it had historically taken \"territory and natural resources from other nations by force, to put at the service of its businesses and monopolies\",: Se ha caracterizado históricamente por despojar por la fuerza a otras naciones y países de territorios y recursos naturales para ponerlos al servicio de sus empresas y monopolios. and the George W. Bush article says that he continues a family tradition of corruption, deceit and intrigue.: Continúa una larga tradición familiar de negocios sucios, trampas e intrigas gubernamentales, que comenzó con su abuelo, el Senador Prescott Bush, y continuó con su padre, George Bush. ==References== Category:Establishments in Cuba Category:2010 establishments in North America Category:Encyclopedia websites Category:MediaWiki websites Category:Cuban culture",
