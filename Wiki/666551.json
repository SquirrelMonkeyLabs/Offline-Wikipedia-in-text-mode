 "text": "Richard Neece Ojeda II (; born September 25, 1970) is an American politician and retired U.S. Army officer. He was the West Virginia State Senator from the 7th district from 2016 to 2019. He is a member of the Democratic Party. == Career == Ojeda was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives in West Virginia's 3rd congressional district in the 2018 election, but lost that election to Republican Carol Miller. On November 12, 2018, Ojeda announced his candidacy for President of the United States in the 2020 election. Ojeda was the second office-holding Democrat to announce a campaign for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the first being Maryland Rep. John Delaney. As no current state legislator has ever made a serious bid for the presidency, Ojeda was considered a \"longshot\" and \"underdog\" candidate. On January 26, 2019, Ojeda withdrew from the election. On January 13, 2020, Ojeda announced his campaign for the United States Senate, challenging incumbent Shelley Moore Capito. However, he lost the nomination to progressive Paula Jean Swearengin. In 2023, Ojeda formed \"Turn Left PAC\" which initially attacked West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin as a \"traitor.\" Although public filings show the PAC has raised minimal funds, in 2024 Ojeda used it to publicly accuse members of Congress who favor American support for Israel's defense as being \"corrupt politicians [who] line their pockets with blood money\" from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Military people from Minnesota Category:State legislators of the United States Category:Politicians from West Virginia Category:Politicians from Minnesota Category:2020 United States presidential candidates Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:People from Rochester, Minnesota",
