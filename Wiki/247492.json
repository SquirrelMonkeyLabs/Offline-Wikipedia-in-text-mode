A., & Schoonover, S. (1991). GNU Emacs: UNIX text editing and programming. Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc.. Emacs is primarily used by just about everyone from programmers to home desktop users. This is because emacs can do just about anything you can think of. Some of the uses of Emacs include: * Creating PDF documents * Setting up agendas and to-do lists * Reading e-mail and news * Keeping a calendar and diary * Chat on IRC * It can even act as a desktop manger (Linux, BSD or other Unix like systems only at this time) Emacs is made powerful by Emacs Lisp, a built-in programming language that lets the user extend the capabilities of the editor. A common Emacs joke is that all of the functions of the editor are crazy weird keystrokes (such as \"control-meta-4 shift-left-P-semicolon-F1\" to do something simple like cut and paste text). In reality, though, these keystrokes are relatively simple, though they can take some getting used to. There is an Internet turf war between programmers that prefer Emacs and programmers that prefer Vim (or Vi),Robbins, A., Hannah, E., & Lamb, L. (2008).
