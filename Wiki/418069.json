 "text": "The Alawites, also known as Alawis (ʿAlawīyyah ) are an Arab ethnoreligious group who live primarily in the Levant particularly in the coastal regions or the areas near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Alawism is a sect which branched out from Shia Islam during the 9th century. They live mainly in Syria but also have a presence in neighboring countries Lebanon and Turkey. They initially branched out of the Twelver school of Shia Islam however they differ greatly from the Twelver Shias as they believe in the divinity of Ali. Alawites worship Ali, and the name \"Alawi\" means followers of Ali. Alawites are also called Nusayris although this term has been considered derogatory. ==Other websites== *Reuters Category:Shia Islam",
