 "text": "A dwarf is a humanlike creature from Norse and Germanic mythologies. They have been used in many fairy tales, fantasy, fiction and role-playing games. Pop culture depicts the Dwarves as being short, however original mythology does not, and they were described interchangeably with elves in some stories. In some stories, dwarfs are mean, living under bridges, and having a bad reputation for stealing treasure. One example is the Norwegian Troll. It is an ugly and foolish creature who tells lies. It causes problems everywhere it goes. That is how the Internet troll got its name. In Robert Louis Stevenson's story, \"Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" Edward Hyde is described as \"a dwarf.\"http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/literature/Dr-Jekyll-and-Mr- Hyde-Summary-and-Analysis-Chapter-1-Chapter-8.id-88,pageNum-20.html On the other hand, J. R. R. Tolkien's hobbits and the munchkins in The Wizard of Oz are likeable, honest, good and smart. == Related pages == * Dvergr * Goblin == References == == Other websites == * Pictures from the \"25cm dwarf\", discovered in Iran. * Orange Alternative Website * Dwarves and Pygmies of ancient Egypt Category:Mythology",
