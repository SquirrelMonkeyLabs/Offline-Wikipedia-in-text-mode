 "text": "Hinulugan Taktak, is a waterfall and Protected Landscape in the city outskirts of Antipolo in Rizal province, Philippines. Initially assigned as a recreation area, the waterfall area has been designated as a national park by virtue of a Republic Act No. 6964 in 1990. Ten years later, it became a protected landscape under a presidential Proclamation No. 412. It is managed by the country's Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Rizal Provincial Government. ==Folk History== Folk knowledge has it that the name was derived from a large bell (taktak) that was thrown (hinulog) into the falls during the late 15th century or early 16th century because the local villagers considered it too loud. It then became known as Hinulugang Taktak or the place where the bell fell. Hinulugang Taktak is featured in a hymn entitled Antipolo composed by German San Jose in 1929, with lyrics alluding to it as a recreational journey. ==Geography and geology== Located around from the Antipolo Cathedral, the falls originate the headwaters of the Sapang Baho River (also known as Antipolo River and Taktak River), which flow through the Manggahan Floodway into Laguna de Bay. The falls have a height of 21.5 meters (70.5 feet) and a width of 25.8 meters (84.6 feet). The rocks beneath the Quaternary soil are Miocene layers. ==Biology and ecology== At least 11 species of trees can be found in the area, including 1Senna spectabilis, 2Cananga odorata, 3Swietenia macrophylla, 4Pterocarpus indicus, 5Chrysophyllum cainito, 6Artocarpus heterophyllus, 7Persea americana, 8Sandoricum koetjape, 9Mangifera indica, 10Averrhoa bilimbi, and 11Cocos nucifera. While there is no report of endemic or endangered species present, animal species in the area include Varanus salvator, Python reticulatus, and Draco volans. ==Gallery== File:Hinulugang Taktak National Park.jpg| File:Hinulugang_Taktak_National_Park_falls_top_(Dela_Paz,_Antipolo,_Rizal;_02-06-2024).jpg| File:The_Beauty_of_Hinulugang_taktak_Falls.jpg| File:Hinulugang Taktak topview.jpg| ==References== Category:Geography of the Philippines Category:Waterfalls of the Philippines",
