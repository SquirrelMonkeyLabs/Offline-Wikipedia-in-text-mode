 "text": "In chemistry, a strong acid is an acid which ionizes (splits) completely in a solution of water. It always loses a proton (A H+) when put in water. A weak acid does not always lose a proton, though; It can lose its proton, but not all the time. They also have a very low pH, usually between 1 and 3. Many strong acids have a negative pKa value, which means they are very strong. The six common strong acids are: (Acronym:CBSPIN) # HydroChloric acid HCl # HydroBromic acid HBr # Sulfuric acid H₂SO₄ # Perchloric acid HClO4 # HydroIodic acid HI # Nitric acid HNO3 Almost strong acids include: # Chloric acid HClO3 Category:Acids",
