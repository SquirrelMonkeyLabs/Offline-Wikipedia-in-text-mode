 "text": "Phyllodytes gyrinaethes is a frog. It lives in Brazil in the state of Alagoas. People have seen it as high as 710 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen this frog on the ground and on bromeliad plants. Sometimes the bromeliad plants grow on the ground, and sometimes they grow on trees. This frog is usually between 0.8 and 10.0 meters above the ground. These frogs live on smaller bromeliad plants. Scientists sometimes see more than one adult frog and tadpole on the same bromeliad together. Scientists have seen this frog in the parts of forests that are still there after the rest of the forest is gone. Scientists say human beings change the places where it lives to build towns, build farms, get wood to build with, and make places for animals to eat grass. Human beings also take away the bromeliad plants that the frogs need. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
