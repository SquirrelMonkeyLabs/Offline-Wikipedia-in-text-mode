 "text": "Birkat haMazon (Blessing of the Meal) is known in English as the Grace/Blessing after a Meal. A \"Meal\" is defined as a meal which began with the breaking of bread. Without bread, the meal is seen as just a \"snack\", and the formula for this Grace is not said. The traditional Grace consists of 4 Talmudic blessings followed by a collection of later medieval petitions/requests (and the number and contents differ between the various Ashkenazi, Sefardi and Mizrachi forms of the Birkat haMazon). The Four Talmudic blessings are # Blessing God for providing food # Blessing God for the land and the food which is grown on it (and the land referred to here is understood to be the land of Israel). # Blessing God for Jerusalem (ancient capital of the land of Israel), home of the Temple # Blessing God for His Goodness There are also additions for special occasions (the sabbath, festivals etc. - and for such matters as circumcisions, weddings and funerals). ==References== * Text of the Birkat Hamazon (Ashkenazi formula, Hebrew/English) Category:Jewish culture",
