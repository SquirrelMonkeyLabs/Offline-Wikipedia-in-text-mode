 "text": "Chirixalus trilaksonoi is a frog. It lives in two different parts of Indonesia. People see this frog in paddy fields, on paddy plants, and on palm oil farms They see this frog between 191 and 400 meters above sea level. Scientists do not know for sure where this frog lays eggs, but they think it lays them in streams, like other frogs in Chirixalus. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in only two small places, and human beings change those places in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. Chemicals meant to kill pests can also kill this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
