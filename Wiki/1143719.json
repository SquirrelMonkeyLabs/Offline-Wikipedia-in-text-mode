 "text": "The Vela Pulsar (PSR J0835-4510 or PSR B0833-45) is a pulsar located in the constellation of Vela in the Vela supernova remnant. About 11,000–12,300 years ago, a massive star went Type II supernova. It is about 1,000 light years away from Earth. The pulsar's magnetic field is about 10,000 times stronger than Earths magnetic field. It was first discovered in 1968 by a student at the University of Sydney. Its mass is equal to 1.4 times that of the Sun. == Description == === Notable characteristics === The brightest pulsar (in radio frequencies), it spins 11 times per second meaning it makes a full rotation in just 89.33 milliseconds.Even though it has so much mass, its only about 484 square miles, thats smaller then the city of London.The Jet of particals from the star travel 70% the speed of light. === Glitches === Vela is best-known for its glitches. However, they are not predictable yet. == Location == * Right accension: 08h 35m 20.65525s * Declination:-45° 10' 35.1545 * 0.3 KPC (978 light years) * 294 pc * Vela supernova remnant == Gallery == File:267641main allsky labeled HI.jpg|Position in the Milky Way File:Cycle of pulsed gamma rays from the Vela pulsar 220px.gif|Gamma rays are being emitted from the Vela Pulsar.
