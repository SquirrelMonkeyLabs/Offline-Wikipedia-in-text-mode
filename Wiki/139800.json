 "text": "The Var is a department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in Provence in southeastern France. It takes its name from the river Var, which used to flow along its eastern border, but the border was moved in 1860. Its prefecture is the city of Toulon. ==History== Var is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790 with Toulon as is capital. It was formed with part of the former province of Provence. It was divided in nine districts: Toulon, Grasse, Hyères, Draguignan, Brignoles, Saint-Maximin, Fréjus, Saint-Paul-lès-Vence and Barjols. The capital was moved, in 1793, from Toulon to Grasse and, in 1795, from Grasse to Brignoles. In 1797, the capital was moved again, to Draguignan. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the nine districts were changed into four arrondissements: Brignoles, Draguignan, Grasse and Toulon. After the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), the department was occupied by the Austrian army from June 1815 to November 1818. On 15 June 1860, the arrondissement of Grasse passed to the new department of Alpes-Maritimes. With this change, the Var river does not flow any longer through the department named after it. On 10 September 1926, the arrondissement of Brignoles was eliminated but in 1974 Brignoles was made again an arrondissement and the capital was moved from Draguignan to Toulon. The Var is the only French department that has had four different capitals: Toulon, Grasse, Brignoles and Draguignan; now Toulon is the prefecture (capital) and Brignoles and Draguignan are subprefectures. Grasse is now a subprefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department. During World War II, the department was occupied by the fascist Italy, from November 1942 to December 1943.
