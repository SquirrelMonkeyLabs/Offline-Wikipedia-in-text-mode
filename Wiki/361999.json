 "text": "Mary Kay Bergman (June 5, 1961 – November 11, 1999) was an American voice actress. Bergman was probably best known for playing most of the female characters on the animated sitcom South Park, and the first voice of main character Timmy Turner on the Oh Yeah Cartoons which inspired The Fairly OddParents. Bergman was married to Dino Andrade, who was also a voice actor. She was also good friends with The Simpsons voice actress Nancy Cartwright and Grey DeLisle. Bergman suffered from bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder which she hid from her family and friends. Her last appearance was on November 11, 1999 during a radio show that was celebrating Disneyland's 45th anniversary. Later in the day, she shot herself in the forehead just above her nose with a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. She was found by her husband and a friend. == Filmography == Movie Year Tíle Role Notes 1991 Beauty and the Beast Babette 1994 Felidae Hermann 1 Uncredited 1987 Annie: A Royal Adventure!
