As of 2007, there was no public or semi-public space for gays as in western countries. The official position is that there are no gays in Yemen.And then there was Yemen. As a result of Sharia, LGBT people are killed in attacks. The government does not protect its gay citizens from violence. A report on the Human rights situation in Yemen since 2014 by the UN Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen stated that anti-LGBT discrimination and violence had been exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, and witnesses described cases of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, torture, and sexual violence. The US Department of State report found that the government did not consider anti-LGBT violence or discrimination relevant for official reporting. Few LGBT people were open regarding their sexual orientation or gender identity, though those that were faced discrimination. In October of 2023, a student of Sana’a University was expelled after being accused of promoting Homosexuality. In February, according to AFP, 13 people were sentenced to death for homosexuality at a court in Ibb Governorate, an area under the control of Houthi rebels. The charges were announced on the 4th of February, 2024. ==Criminal Provisions== Penal Code 1994, Article 264 Homosexuality Penal Code 1994, Article 268 Lesbianism ===Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)=== ====al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula==== In 2013 there were credible reports of members of the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were killing men for allegedly being gay. ====Islamic State==== ===Summary=== Same- sex sexual activity is prohibited under the Penal Code 1994, which criminalises acts of ‘Homosexuality’ and ‘Lesbianism’. These provisions carry a maximum penalty of death by stoning. Both men and women are criminalised under this law. The provisions have their origins in Islamic law, with the Constitution designating Islam as the State religion, and Sharia as the source of all Law. There is no evidence of the law being enforced by the government in recent years, however reports have suggested that Militant groups have executed men suspected of being gay in areas they controlled. There have been some reports of discrimination and violence being committed against LGBT people in recent years, including murder, arbitrary detention, torture, and sexual violence. ==Summary table== Same-sex sexual activity legal (Penalty: Lashes, prison and up to execution) Up to Death (Under Houthi movement) Equal age of consent Anti-discrimination laws in employment only Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) Same-sex marriages Recognition of same-sex couples Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples Joint adoption by same-sex couples LGBT people allowed to serve openly in the military Right to change legal gender Access to IVF for lesbians Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples MSMs allowed to donate blood ==References== Yemen Category:LGBT culture in Yemen Yemen",
