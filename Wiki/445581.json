Lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong said in February 2012 that the band was in the studio, recording music for the album. He said in a statement, \"We are at the most prolific and creative time in our lives... This is the best music we've ever written, and the songs just keep coming. Instead of making one album, we are making a three album trilogy. Every song has the power and energy that represents Green Day on all emotional levels. We just can't help ourselves ... We are going epic as fuck!\" ==Songs== ==References== Category:2012 albums Category:Green Day albums",
