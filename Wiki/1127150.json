 "text": "Rancho Pescadero (also called \"Punta del Cipreses\") was a Mexican land grant in present day Monterey County, California given on March 3, 1836 by Governor Nicolás Gutiérrez to Fabián Barreto. Pescadero means fishing place in Spanish. The grant extended along the Pacific coast from Rancho Punta de Pinos and Seal Rocks south to Carmel by the Sea and encompassed present day Pebble Beach, California. ==History== Fabián Barreto, a Mexican who came to Monterey in 1827 married María del Carmen Garcia Barreto Madariaga in 1833. Barreto received the one square league grant in 1836, but died in 1841. His widow, Maria, sold the Rancho Pescadero most likely becaue she could not pay the taxes on the land. David Jacks acquired the property through John Frederick Romie. David Jacks married Maria Cristina Soledad Romie (1837-1917) on April 20, 1861, in San Luis Obispo, California and produced nine children, with only seven surviving childhood. With the Mexican Cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Pescadero was filed by John C. Gore with the Public Land Commission in 1853, but the grant was patented to David Jacks in 1868. David Jacks sold the rancho to the Pacific Improvement Company in 1880. ==References== Category:Northern California Category:Monterey County, California Category:Geography of California",
