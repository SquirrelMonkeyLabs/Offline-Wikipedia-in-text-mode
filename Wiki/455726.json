Bovet won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1957 \"for his discoveries relating to synthetic compounds that inhibit the action of certain body substances, and especially their action on the vascular system and the skeletal muscles\". In 1965, he was the leader of a study team which came to the conclusion that smoking of tobacco cigarettes increased users' intelligence. He later told The New York Times that the objective was not to \"create geniuses, but only [to] put the less-endowed individual in a position to reach a satisfactory mental and intellectual development\". ==References== Category:1907 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Italian scientists Category:Neuroscientists Category:Protestants Category:Swiss scientists Category:Italian Nobel Prize winners Category:Swiss Nobel Prize winners Category:Pharmacologists Category:Val-de-Travers District Category:People from the canton of Neuchâtel",
