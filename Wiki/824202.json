 "text": "The February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm, also called Winter Storm Uri, was a major winter and ice storm that impacted the United States, Northern Mexico, and parts of Canada from February 13 to 17, 2021. The storm started out in the Pacific Northwest and quickly moved into the Southern United States, before moving on to the Midwestern and Northeastern United States a couple of days later. The storm caused over 170 million Americans being placed under winter alerts across the country and caused blackouts for over 9.9 million people in the U.S. and Mexico, most notably in Texas. The blackouts were the largest in the U.S. since the Northeast blackout of 2003. The storm also brought dangerous severe weather to Southeastern United States, including several tornadoes. On February 16, there were at least 20 direct deaths and 13 indirect deaths caused by the storm; by February 19, the death toll had risen to at least 70, including 58 people in the United States and 12 people in Mexico. ==References== February 13–17 winter storm Category:February 2021 events",
