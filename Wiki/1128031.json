 "text": "The Southern Bell Telephone Company is a telecommunications provider in the Southeastern United States. It does business as the \"new\" AT&T; (or American Telephone and Telegraph). The network operates in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. Until 1968, the company also operated in Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and several sections of Louisiana. In 1968, Southern Bell Telephone was renamed South Central Bell in those five states. Southern Bell was founded in 1879 in Atlanta, Georgia. Right after the Bell System breakup on January 1, 1984, Southern Bell and South Central Bell were operated by the Regional Operating Bell System Company BellSouth. The two names stopped being used in the early-to-mid 1990s. However, they were brought back in the late 2000s or early 2010s by the \"new\" AT&T; and began doing business as such. ==References== Category:American telephone companies Category:1990s disestablishments in the United States Category:21st-century establishments",
