 "text": "The theorbo is a musical instrument. It is a lute with a longer neck. It is played by plucking the strings with one hand. Another hand presses the strings. This changes the pitch. It has an extra set of bass strings. This gives the theorbo a bigger range of notes to play. It was used to play basso continuo parts in the baroque period. It was also played as a solo instrument. ==References== * Category:Plucked string instruments Category:Early musical instruments",
