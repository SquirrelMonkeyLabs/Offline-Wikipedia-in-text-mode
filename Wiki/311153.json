 "text": "Audio description is an explanation for visually impaired or blind people of television, dance, opera, movies, museums or other visual art. A narrator makes a description of what's happening, usually when nobody is talking. The first talking picture ever shown especially for the blind was a 1929 screening of Bulldog Drummond for members of the New York Association for the Blind and New York League for the Hard of Hearing, which had a live description for the visually-impaired people. Descriptive video service which was started by the Public Broadcasting Service is used for the DVDs of certain movies as part of the audio description. == References == Category:Audio technology",
