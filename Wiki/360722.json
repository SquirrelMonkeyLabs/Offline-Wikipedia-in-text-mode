 "text": "Palenquero is a Spanish-African Creole language spoken in Colombia. Is it spoken primarily in the Northern and the Caribbean parts of Colombia; the palenque villages and their diasporas. == Formation of Palenquero == Palenquero, just like in the other Spanish-Based Caribbean Creoles, has influences from the contact between European masters and African slaves. In the case of Palenquero, it has been accepted that the maroons (escaped slaves) moved in somewhere in the mountains, along with some Native Americans. The maroons had very little contact with their masters, which led to them having to blend their African substrate languages with the Spanish European ones. == African influences == Palenquero has a lot of African influence in its sounds, phonetics, syntax, grammar, vocabulary, and a lot of words. === Vocabulary === :burú-silver, money :ngombe-cattle :ngubá-peanut :posá-house :tambore-drum :mai-mother :bumbilo-garbage :chepa-clothing :chitiá-to speak :ngaina-chicken :tabáko-cigarette :hemano-brother :onde-where :pueta-door :ngolo-fat :flo- flower :moná-child :ceddo-pig :cateyano-Spanish/Castillian :foratero-outsider :kusa-thing, stuff :cuagro-neighborhood cohort === Sample === Lord's Prayer :Tatá suto lo ke ta riba sielo, :santifikaro sendá nombre si, :miní a reino sí, asé ño boluntá sí, :aí tiela kumo a sielo. :Nda suto agué pan ri to ma ría, :peddona ma fata suto, :asina kumo suto a se peddoná, :lo ke se fatá suto. :Nu rejá sujo kaí andí tentasión nu, :librá suto ri má.
