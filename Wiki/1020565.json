 "text": "An escape room is a room in which people are locked in order to play a game requiring them to solve a series of puzzles within a certain amount of time to accomplish a goal, typically finding the key to unlock the room. Note that most escape rooms are not really locked, and players are not actually trapped. The key they seek is symbolic of the escape from the room. While it often unlocks a door, there is always an unlocked door at the ready in case of emergencies. Category:Games",
