 "text": "Nicolaas \"Nico\" van Nieuwenhuysen (14 November 1889 â€“ 1967) was a Dutch physician. During World War II he was cruel camp doctor of Kamp Amersfoort and later on the Eastern Front. ==Biography== Before World War II Nieuwenhysen worked as a general practitioner. Because his practice was going downhill during World War II due to his pro-German attitude, he accepted the German offer to come and work in Kamp Amersfoort. He was doctor there between September 1941 and March 1942 and worked as a surgeon. Van Nieuwenhuysenhad neglected, abused, starved, and exposed his patients to disease. Van Nieuwenhuysen abused patients whom he believed were simulating an illness, to escape the strict regime in the camp. He had kicked and beaten the prisoners and made them bend their knees until exhaustion, withheld medical care from them, did not provide them with medicines when they were available, did not give them spiritual assistance and did not isolate them when they had a contagious disease; Jews and Soviet prisoners of war in particular. In September 1941 hundred and one Soviet soldiers entered the camp. During their stay they were not treated or cared for. Many died from an illness, malnutrition or abuse. After six months, the soldiers who were still alive where shot. Nieuwenhusen had the heads of two dead Russians amputated and boiled, and placed the skulls on his desk as 'trophies'. In 1942 Radio Oranje named him \"De Beul of Amersfoort\" (The Executioner of Amersfoort). In March 1942 he left Kamp Amersfoort voluntarily and moved with the Schutzstaffel to the Eastern Front. After World War II Van Nieuwenhuysen was detained in the prison in Leeuwarden. For his activities during the war he was sentenced in 1950 to twenty years in prison and received a lifelong professional ban. This has been the heaviest sentence imposed on a doctor after World War II. Van Nieuwenhysen died in 1967. ==Literature== General practitioner Adriaan van Es and journalist Arjeh Kalmann did for four years research on Van Nieuwenhuysen. They wrote the book Maar ik ben geen schooier about Van Nieuwenhuysen, that was published in January 2023. ==References== Category:Dutch physicians Category:Surgeons Category:1889 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Dutch people of World War II Category:Place of death missing",
