 "text": "The Cumberland Gap is a narrow pass near the junction of the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. It passes through the Cumberland Mountains, which are in the Appalachian Mountains. First used by Native Americans, the Cumberland Gap was well-known in American colonial history as an important path through the lower Appalachians. In 1775, the trail was started by Daniel Boone. Over the next 35 years, over 300,000 settlers used it to get to the western borders of Kentucky and Tennessee. The Cumberland Gap was an important part of the Wilderness Road and is now part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. == References == ==Other websites== Category:Landforms of the United States Category:Mountain passes Category:Appalachian Mountains",
