 "text": "Inger's flying frog or the short-nosed tree frog (Leptomantis gauni) is a frog. It lives in Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia. People have seen it between 750 and 980 meters above sea level. This frog lives in rainforests that have never been cut down and rainforests that were cut down and are growing back on hills. This frog lays eggs in foam nests on plants over water. The tadpoles swim near the rocky bottoms of streams. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Human beings cut down the forests where the frogs live to get wood to build with and make farms for palm oil. Many of the places this frog lives are protected parks. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
