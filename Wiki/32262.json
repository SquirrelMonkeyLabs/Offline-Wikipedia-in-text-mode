 "text": "The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose and sometimes white or purple rose. Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild: they grew in North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 150 different species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been selected by people. Over hundreds of years they have been specially bred to produce a wide variety of growing habits and a broad range of colours from dark red to white including as well yellow and a bluish/lilac colour. Many roses have a strong, pleasant scent. Most roses have spines (incorrectly called prickles) on their stems. This is a common defense system in plants. Rose bushes are able to live in a wide variety of conditions. The fruit of the rose is called a hip or a haw or a hep. Some roses have decorative hips. == Roses in legend and in history == Roses are widely used across the world as symbols of love, sympathy or sorrow. Rose is widely used as a girl's name. The rose was sacred to Venus. Venus was the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It was also linked with Cupid (son of Venus). He was the Roman god of desire – in one myth, he dropped nectar and the nectar bubbled up from the ground as roses. The rose was also sacred to Bacchus. He was the Roman god of wine. Rich Romans would lie on couches with roses laid on them. They would wear roses tied onto string around their neck. Anything which was said \"under the rose\" was considered to be a secret. Cleopatra VII of Egypt was said to have had a floor of her palace covered in roses before her lover Mark Antony visited her. == Description and use == The flower of the rose plant can be different sizes. It may be as small as 1/2 inch across to a diameter of almost 7 inches. Also, roses can be used for good scent. The scent of the rose comes from tiny perfume glands on the petals, which can be seen through a powerful microscope. Sometimes rose petals are dried and packed so that you can use them for decoration or for scent. Roses can be seen in many gardens. In a big vineyard, a bush of roses are planted at the end of each row of vines. As long as the roses stay healthy, the vine growers assume their vines are healthy as well. == Garden roses == There are thousands of rose cultivars that people grow in gardens and on farms. The names used to describe the different types often refer to one species that is the main ancestor of that group, for example, Gallica roses are mostly descended from Rosa gallica. Other groups have several different species among their ancestors. Hybrid Tea roses, Floribunda roses, and English roses are the most common in gardens today. They are of so many colours like red, yellow, orange, pink, purple and so on * Alba roses * Bourbon roses * Centifolia roses * China roses * Climbing roses * Damask roses * English roses * Floribunda roses * Gallica roses * Hybrid Bracteata roses * Hybrid Musk roses * Hybrid Perpetual roses * Hybrid Tea roses * Miniature roses * Modern Shrub roses * Moss roses * Noisette roses * Rugosa roses == Symbolism == In the Catholic religion, rose is a symbolic element of the Holy Rosary; it is reported that Fra Angelico, praying the rosary in the street, saw the Virgin with a group of Angels offering her hymns and prayers while they were composing a crown of roses. Surprised by the vision, he interrupted the prayer and the angels stopped; when he prayed again he saw the angels recommencing to compose the crown of roses to offer to Mary.
