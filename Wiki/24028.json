T. O'Shea, Trapped between the map and reality: geography and perceptions of Kurdistan, 258 pp., Routledge, 2004. (see p. 77) * * There are exclaves of Kurds in Central Anatolia, Khorasan, and the Caucasus, as well as significant Kurdish diaspora communities in the cities of western Turkey, particularly Istanbul, and Western Europe, primarily in Germany. Kurds are one of the largest and most important ethnic groups in the Middle East. There are between about 60 million and about 80 million Kurds. Most of the Kurdish population lives in Kurdistan. Kurdistan is the area where Kurds live. Today, it is a border country with lands in the east and southeast of Turkey, in the north- west of Iran, in the north of Iraq and in the north-east of Syria. (Lands in Armenia and Azerbaijan also have small Kurdish populations.) == Languages == Many Kurds speak the Kurdish language. The two largest Kurdish dialects are Kurmanji Kurdish and Sorani Kurdish. The Kurds of Turkish Kurdistan (Bakur) and of Syrian Kurdistan(Rojava)speak Kurmanji. About half of Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan (Rojhelat) and Iraqi Kurdistan (Bashur) speak Kurmanji, while other Kurds there speak Sorani. Some Kurds in Iranian Kurdistan (Rojhelat) speak the Gorani Kurdish dialect, while others in Turkish Kurdistan (Bakur) speak Zazaki Kurdish. == Lifestyles == Until the 20th century, most Kurds were nomadic people. The Kurds' economy had a close connection with pastoralism and animal husbandry. In the 21st century, nomadism is not common among Kurds. Most Kurds now live in cities. In the 21st century, farming is the most important work in Kurdistan. Industrialization means that fewer Kurds work as farmers, and this has caused urbanization of the Kurdish population. In the past, Kurds were part of the Silk Road economic system. Trade routes form connections between different countries through Kurdistan. Some scholars make an argument that the meaning of the name was not an ethnonym at the time, because many different groups of nomads and pastoralists had the name \"Kurds\" during the Middle Ages. However, other scholars make the argument that the name was not the name of lifestyle or economic system, such as nomadism or pastoralism, but the name of a population. This population shared a common character in linguistics, shared an area to live in, and shared a mythology. Whether the people and groups who had the name \"Kurds\" thought that they were a common community before the 12th century is unknown. == Interethnic relations == The Kurds share their lands with other ethnic groups. Some of the Kurds' neighbours are Turks, Arabs, Persians, Jews, Armenians and Assyrians. In the past, some Arabic and Turkic people became Kurds by cultural assimilation. In the nationalist period, the governments of the states controlling Kurdistan attempted the forced assimilation of Kurds into Turkish, Iranian or Arab culture. These states also moved Turks, Persians or Arabs into Kurdistan. The governments of these states did so via genocide, ethnocide and linguicide, often with tacit approval from other countries. ==History== ===Origin=== The name of the Kurds is very old. The first proof of the name is from writing in Middle Persian (Pahlavi), the language of the Sasanian Empire. The name became most common after the Islamic conquests during the 7th century CE. ===Antiquity=== Some scholars have associated the Kurds with the Medes, an ancient Iranian people.Jwaideh, Wadie (2006). The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development. Syracuse University Press. . p. xv, \"The empire of the Medes, one of the reputed ancestors of the Kurdish people (...)\"Daryaee, Touraj (2012). The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History. Oxford University Press. . p. 122, \"(...) the Medes (ancestors of many Iranians, particularly the Kurds) (...)\" Gernot Ludwig Windfuhr, professor of Iranian Studies, states that the majority of those who now speak Kurdish most likely were formerly speakers of a Median dialect.Windfuhr, Gernot (1975). Isoglosses: A Sketch on Persians and Parthians, Kurds and Medes. Monumentum H. S. Nyberg II (Acta Iranica–5). Tehran-Liège: Bibliothèque Pahlavi. 457–472. p. 468. Windfuhr also states Kurdish languages as Parthian, albeit with a Median substratum.Windfuhr, Gernot (1975). Isoglosses: A Sketch on Persians and Parthians, Kurds and Medes. Monumentum H.S. Nyberg II (Acta Iranica–5). Leiden: 457–471. During the Sassanid era, in \"Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan\" a short prose work written in Middle Persian, Ardashir I (founder of Sasanian empire) is depicted as having battled the Kurds and their leader, Madig. After initially sustaining a heavy defeat, Ardashir I was successful in subjugating the Kurds.\"Kârnâmag î Ardashîr î Babagân\" (1896). Trans. D. D. P. Sanjana. In a letter sent by Ardashir's enemy, Ardavan, and in the same work, it is stated that he was a Kurd. > You've bitten off more than you can chew and you have brought death to > yourself. O son of a Kurd, raised in the tents of the Kurds, who gave you > permission to put a crown on your head? The usage of the term \"Kurd\" during this time period most likely was a social term, designating Northwestern Iranian nomads, rather than a concrete ethnic group.Limbert, J. (1968). The Origins and Appearance of the Kurds in Pre- Islamic Iran. Iranian Studies. 1 (2): 41–51.Asatrian, G. (2009). Prolegemona to the Study of Kurds. Iran and the Caucasus. 13 (1): 1–58. ===Middle Ages=== In the Islamic world of the early Middle Ages, the word had a loose meaning. The meaning was variable, and people gave many tribes and nomadic peoples the word Kurd. Peoples living in the mountains between Anatolia and the Iranian plateau often had the name \"Kurd\". In the Persian language and Arabic language, writers during the 10th century gave the name to different ethnic groups. In early Middle Ages, the Kurds sporadically appear in Arabic sources, though the term was still not being used for a specific people; instead it referred to an amalgam of nomadic western Iranian tribes, who were distinct from Persians. However, in the High Middle Ages, the Kurdish ethnic identity gradually materialized, as one can find clear evidence of the Kurdish ethnic identity and solidarity in texts of the 12th and 13th centuries,James, Boris. (2006). Uses and Values of the Term Kurd in Arabic Medieval Literary Sources. University of Beirut. pp. 6–7. though, the term was also still being used in the social sense.James, Boris. (2006). Uses and Values of the Term Kurd in Arabic Medieval Literary Sources. American University of Beirut. pp. 4, 8, 9. Since 10th century, Arabic texts including al-Masudi's works, have referred to Kurds as a distinct linguistic group.James, Boris (2019). Constructing the Realm of the Kurds (al-Mamlaka al-Akradiyya): Kurdish In-betweenness and Mamluk Ethnic Engineering (1130-1340 CE). In Tamari, Steve (ed.). Grounded Identities: Territory and Belonging in the Medieval and Early Modern Middle East and Mediterranean. Brill. p. 20. From 11th century onward, the term Kurd is explicitly defined as an ethnonym and this does not suggest synonymity with the ethnographic category nomad.James, Boris (2014). Arab Ethnonyms ('Ajam, 'Arab, Badu and Turk): The Kurdish Case as a Paradigm for Thinking about Differences in the Middle Ages. Iranian Studies. 47 (5): 683–712 (see 692). In the 10th-12th centuries, a number of Kurdish principalities and dynasties were founded, ruling Kurdistan and neighbouring areas: * Shaddadids (951–1174) a dynasty of Kurdish origin.Peacock, Andrew (2000). \"SHADDADIDS\".

They migrated to the large cities in the Middle East and to Western Europe. Since the Middle Ages, there have also been Kurdish communities in Cairo, Beirut, Damascus, and Aleppo. Since the Early Modern Period, there have also been Kurdish communities in Khorasan, a region covering modern north-eastern Iran and Afghanistan. ====Persecution in the Soviet Union==== The Soviet Union also committed ethnic cleansing against Kurds by forcing them to migrate from the Caucasus to Central Asia. When the Soviet Union ended, the First Nagorno-Karabakh War between Armenia and Azerbaijan harmed most Kurds in the Caucasus. ==Religions== Most Kurds are Muslims associated with Sunni Islam. Most Kurds are part of the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence, but some Kurds are part of the Hanafi school. Sufism is also common among Kurds. There are also Kurds who are part of Shia Islam and Kurds who are part of Alevism. There are also Kurdish Jews and Yazidi people. ===Classical antiquity=== In Classical antiquity, the most important deities of the Kurds' lands were Ahura Mazda and Mithra. The most common religion was Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrianism was probably the state religion of the Achaemenid Empire. There are connections between the writings of Zoroastrianism and the Vedas, the Hindu writings of ancient India. ===Middle Ages=== In the 7th century, Kurds had many different religious beliefs. There were Christians and Zoroastrians. There were also Kurdish Jews. Some sects among the Kurdish Christians and Jews had religious beliefs from Zoroastrianism and Mithraism in their religion. There may have been Kurds among the Companions of the Prophet. Islamic conquests in the 7th century meant that most Kurds became Muslim in the 7th and 8th centuries. Most Kurds converted to Islam between the 7th and 9th centuries CE. Kurds who were not Muslim had to pay the jizya, a tax. Most of these were part of the Shafi'ite system of Islamic jurisprudence. While most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, there are also Kurds of many other religions and sects. There are Kurdish Jews in Iraqi Kurdistan and in Israel as well. ==References==",
