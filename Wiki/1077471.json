He is also the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs and member of the Saudi Council of Ministers since 23 October 2019. He was appointed to that position by a royal decree issued by King Salman. He was previously appointed the Kingdom’s Ambassador to Germany in February 2019 until his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs. ==Early life== Prince Faisal was born on 1 November 1974 in Frankfurt, West Germany and spent most of his childhood and young adulthood in Offenbach. His mother is German and he can speak German language very easily. He completed his studies from United States and then studied business administration at King Saud University which is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ==Political career== Faisal worked as a consultant at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the United States for two years. Before that, he had important jobs in Saudi and international companies, mostly in the aerospace and weapons related field. He used to be a director at Saudi Arabian Military Industries. In January 2017, he had said that, \"He was very happy with his private investment company and had no desire to take up government positions\" but the same year he became an adviser to the Saudi ambassador in the United States. He also led a partnership between the US and Saudi Arabia with Boeing. Additionally, Faisal was an advisor at the Royal Court of Saudi Arabia. In November 2017, Saudi Arabia called ambassador Khalid bin Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud back from Germany, because of a disagreement. This happened after the German Foreign Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, criticized Saudi Arabia's involvement in Lebanon's politics. After about a year with no ambassador, Saudi Arabia sent Faisal bin Farhan to Berlin on 27 March 2019. On 23 October 2019, he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia.
