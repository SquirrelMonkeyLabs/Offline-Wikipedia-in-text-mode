 "text": "Telekura is an abbreviation for telephone clubs. They are a type of dating service that involves a man paying to use a phone in a booth to talk to women on the other end. Rooms also had boxes of tissues included. This usually ended up in the date ending in sexual intercourse. These types of clubs were popular in the 1990s. There is also a more recent version of clubs called Merukura where the users will send each other emails. Some of these clubs were used for prostitution and they were banned through the Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Act in some parts of Japan because of this. ==References== Category:Japanese culture Category:Prostitution",
