 "text": "Jack Christopher Stamp Brooksbank (born 3 May 1986) is an English bar manager and brand ambassador. He is married to Princess Eugenie, the niece of King Charles III. == Early life and family == Brooksbank was born on 3 May 1986 at St Thomas' Hospital in Lambeth, London. He was christened at Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks in Wellington Barracks. He is eldest son of George Edward Hugh Brooksbank and his wife Nicola (n√©e Newton), great-granddaughter of Sir Arthur Holland. Brooksbank is in remainder to the Brooksbank baronetcy. A half-third cousin twice-removed of Princess Eugenie through Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, Brooksbank's great-grandfather was Sir John (Jack) Spencer Coke, a Gentleman Usher to King George VI and Extra Gentleman Usher to Queen Elizabeth II and his great-uncle was the 3rd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell. His parents are Old Etonian George Brooksbank, a company director and chartered accountant, and his wife, Nicola, who reside in London and Bordeaux in France. Jack has a younger brother, Thomas, who is also an Old Etonian. == Education and career == Brooksbank was educated at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire, and then the University of Bristol before leaving to work in the bar industry. He was the general manager of Mahiki, a nightclub in Mayfair that was often visited by his wife's cousins Prince William and Prince Harry in their youth. He now works as a brand ambassador for Casamigos tequila. == Marriage and family == In 2011, Brooksbank began dating Princess Eugenie of York, the younger daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York. On 22 January 2018, the Duke of York's office at Buckingham Palace announced their engagement. In April 2018, the couple moved from their residence at St James's Palace to Ivy Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace. Their wedding took place on 12 October 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor. Contrary to press speculation that Brooksbank would be created \"Earl of Northallerton\", he has not been elevated to the peerage after marrying into the royal family, following a trend in recent years for a male commoner not to be awarded one upon marriage to a princess. The couple's son, August Philip Hawke Brooksbank, was born on 9 February 2021 at the Portland Hospital in London. At his birth, he was eleventh in line to the throne. == Notes == == References == Category:1986 births Category:Businesspeople from London Category:Living people Jack Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol",
