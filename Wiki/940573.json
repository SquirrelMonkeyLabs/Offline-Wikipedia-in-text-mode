 "text": "Alluvium is loose earth which sits on top of consolidated sediment (~ rock). It usually consists of loose gravel and clay. Where people live, it is usually covered with \"made ground\". That is what we call pavements, buildings, and roads. They are the most obvious examples of made ground. There is a discussion about what other sediment deposits should be included under the term \"alluvium\".Miller, Bradley A.; Juilleret, Jérôme 2020.
