 "text": "A whip antenna is the most common example of a monopole radio antenna. Technically, this means that instead of two antennae working together, either side-by-side, or forming a loop, one antenna is replaced. Whip antennas are used frequently in devices such as hand-held radios and mobile phones. Their name is derived from the flexible, whip-like motion they exhibit when struck. Category:Radio",
