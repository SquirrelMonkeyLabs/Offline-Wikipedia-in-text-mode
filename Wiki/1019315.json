These were the castle and the church. During this time period, there were types of towns called \"castra,\" \"castet,\" \"forts,\" and \"castelnaus\". They were said to be fortified settlements with a stone castle inside. Castelnaus were usually made up of many houses in the center. Castelnaus were usually on defensive places at higher elevations. == Layouts == Many types of these 'towns' can be found: round villages like Fourcès in Gers, long street villages or on a high point like Biran in Gers, and villages with concentric circular arcs terraces dominated by the castle.Mairie de Mont-de-Marsan, service communication, Pascal Larrazet , sur le site montdemarsan.fr ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the Middle Ages",
