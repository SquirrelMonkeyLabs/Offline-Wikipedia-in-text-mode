 "text": "The Yemeni Civil War is an ongoing war that began in 2015 between two factions: the Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi led Yemeni government and the Houthi armed movement, along with their supporters and allies. ==Background== Both sides claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently controlling the capital Sanaʽa, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. On 21 March 2015, after taking over Sanaʽa and the Yemeni government, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government. Hadi fled the country the same day. At the same time, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the campaign. ==Damages== According to the UN and other sources, from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670–13,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians,. They estimated more than 50,000 have died as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. With Iran suporting the Huthi and Saudi Arabia opposing them, the conflict has been widely seen as a proxy war and a means for Saudi Arabia to combat Iranian influence in the region.Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? - BBC NewsWho are the Houthis and why are they fighting the Saudi coalition in Yemen? | World news | The Guardian ==Starvation== In 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become \"the worst famine in the world in 100 years.\" The international community sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which included widespread bombing of civilian areas.Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda Unite in Yemen , Huffington Post, \"Despite the international community's condemnation of Saudi Arabia's bombing of civilian areas in Yemen, ... \" The bombing campaign has killed or injured an estimated 17,729 civilians as of March 2019 according to the Yemen Data Project.
