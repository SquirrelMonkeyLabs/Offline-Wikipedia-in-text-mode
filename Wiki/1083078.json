 "text": "Uranium zirconium hydride (abbreviated UZrH), is a type of nuclear fuel. It is used in TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomics) educational reactors. It is not a true chemical compound, but an alloy of uranium, zirconium, and hydrogen. UZrH fuel is used in most educational and research reactors as a result of its material properties making it difficult for it to melt and nearly impossible for it to sustain a high temperature reaction. Franco-Belge de Fabrication du Combustible, in Romans-sur-Is√®re, France, is the only manufacturer of this fuel. == References == == Other websites == * Technical Foundations of TRIGA: Thermalization In Zirconium Hydride * Category:Uranium Category:Alloys",
