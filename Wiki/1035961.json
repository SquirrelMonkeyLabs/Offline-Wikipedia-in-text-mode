Nevelson was born on September 23, 1899 in a place that is now Kyiv, Ukraine. When Nevelson was a child, she moved with her family to the United States. She married Charles Nevelson. They moved to New York City in 1929. The couple had one child and and then the marriage ended in 1931. Louise Nevelson stayed in New York City. She supported herself with many small jobs. In the 1940s, Nevelson began creating her sculptures that are called \"assemblages\". She put together items that she found on the streets of New York City. By the 1950s, she began painting these pieces a single color, sometime called \"monochromatic\". In 1959, her sculpture group \"Dawnâ€™s Wedding Feast\" was included in the important modern art exhibition \"16 Americans\" at the Museum of Modern Art. Nevelson became famous and she was finally able to support herself by making art. Nevelson died on April 17, 1988 in New York City. == References == == Other websites == * *Louise Nevelson biography on the Jewish Women's Archive *Louise Nevelson biography from The Women of Atelier 17: The Biographical Supplement by Christina Weyl Category:1899 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Sculptors",
