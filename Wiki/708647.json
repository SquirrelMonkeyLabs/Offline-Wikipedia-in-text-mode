 "text": "Fanshawe is a town in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. A post office was set up in Fanshawe, Indian Territory, on March 31, 1891. The town got its name from John R. Fanshawe, who worked for the Choctaw, Oklahoma, and Gulf Railroad, which was built in the area in 1889–90. However, the town itself didn’t choose the name. Instead, railroad officials picked names for towns by drawing them from a hat during an inspection trip. When Fanshawe was established, it was part of the Moshulatubbee District in the Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W.
