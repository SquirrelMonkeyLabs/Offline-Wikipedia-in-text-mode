 "text": "Notes on Nationalism is a well-known essay written by George Orwell. Orwell wrote the essay in May 1945, in a journal called Polemic, after the Second World War had ended. In the essay, Orwell describes his idea of nationalism as: Here, he links nationalism to political power, influence and factionalism. He says nationalism is not the same as patriotism, as patriotism \"is of its nature defensive.... Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable (hard to separate) from the desire for power.\" He says that it can be positive, i.e. for something, such as one's country. Orwell says Celtic nationalism and Zionism are examples of this sort of nationalism. On the other hand, it can be negative, i.e. against something, such as another group. Orwell says Anti- Soviet Trotskyism ans Antisemitism are examples of this sort. Transferred nationalism is a third kind. This is identification and promotion of a different race, social class, or country to your own. == Scotland == Orwell's claim that only Scottish nationalists think that using the Lowland Scottish language is important has been criticised by speakers of the language. Orwell's Notes on Nationalism have been used by people on the right-wing of Scottish politics (such as former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson) to argue against 'identity politics'. ==Notes== == References == Category:1945 works Category:British essays Category:Nationalism",
