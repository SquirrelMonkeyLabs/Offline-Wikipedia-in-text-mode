He was his personal physician from 1980 until early 2018. He was born in New York City. In May 2018 Bornstein said that Trump had told him what to write on a letter about his health over the telephone, then sent a car to pick it up. Speaking to The New York Times in February 2017, Bornstein revealed that he was invited to and attended President Trump's inauguration with his wife Melissa. Bornstein told The Times that he enjoyed the attention from being known as the President's personal physician. Bornstein had hoped to be the Physician to the President, but the White House decided that Ronny Jackson would continue in that role.
