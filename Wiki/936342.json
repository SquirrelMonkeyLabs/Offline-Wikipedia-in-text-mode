 "text": "Wayfarer glasses are thick-framed, usually plastic/acetate eyeglasses or sunglasses with square or trapezoidal rims. The style was invented by Ray-Ban in 1956 and represented a refreshing break from the metal wire-rim glasses of the past. The original design resembles Cadillac tail fins. Wayfarer glasses are seen by many as synonymous with punk, hipster or geek chic style. Category:Eyeglasses",
