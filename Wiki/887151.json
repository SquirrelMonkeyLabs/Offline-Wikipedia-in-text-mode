Discs can be put into the PlayStation 2 to make monsters. It is the first Monster Rancher game to allow previous discs or other monsters to be used, so no discs have to be remembered or found. It is the only Monster Rancher game to allow monsters to be traded. They can be traded between memory cards. ==Reception== Metacritic says the game is mostly enjoyed, but not as much as the previous two Monster Rancher games. Eric Bratcher of Next Generation said it is \"A unique, absorbing game that needs to expand its vision in order to live up to its revolutionary roots.\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 29 out of 40. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2001 video games Category:Life simulation games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
