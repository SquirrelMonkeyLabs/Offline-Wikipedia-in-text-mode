 "text": "Since the 1980s, there has been a debate on whether the Holocaust was a unique event in history. * * * * * * ==History== The debate began in West Germany in the 1980s, when some German historians doubted the Holocaust's uniqueness after reviewing the separate history of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. However, mainstream historians, including Emil Fackenheim, Yehuda Bauer, Deborah Lipstadt and Daniel Goldhagen, disagreed and called these doubts a form of Holocaust trivialization. ==Support for Holocaust uniqueness== ===Emil Fackenheim=== In his book To Mend the World, Jewish philosopher Emil Fackenheim (1916 – 2003) wrote that the Holocaust was unique because:Emil Fackenheim, To Mend the World, (IN: Indiana University Press, 1994). * The \"Final Solution\" was designed to exterminate every Jew on earth (including non-Jews with Jewish ancestors) * The Nazis were not trying to achieve any political or economic goals by killing Jews; they simply did not want Jews to exist any more * Most people who carried out the \"Final Solution\" were \"ordinary job holders\" and regular citizens Fackenheim argued that no other genocide in history has had these characteristics. The genocides in Armenia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan happened in specific geographical areas, he wrote, while the Nazis wanted to kill every Jew on earth. For these reasons, he concluded that the Holocaust is unique. ===David Patterson=== David Patterson (1922 – 2005), another Jewish philosopher, agreed with Emil Fackenheim's view. He wrote that the Nazis attempted to annihilate not just the European Jews, but also Judaism itself, its customs, and its worldviews, he wrote. Neither the far left or the far right has acknowledged this, according to Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld in a 2020 article. ===Clemens Heni=== In a 2008 article, political scientist Dr. Clemens Heni (1970 – ) said that antisemitism motivates many of the people who doubt that the Holocaust was unique. IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. Some of these people have trivialized the Holocaust by exaggerating Germans' suffering from Allied bombing operations (like the Dresden bombing in February 1945). Some have falsely accused Israeli Jews of \"weaponizing\" the Holocaust to \"extort\" from modern Germans. Heni classified this rhetoric as \"soft-core Holocaust denial\" Heni pointed out that at a Saxon State Parliament (Landtag) session, the far-right National Democratic Party (NDP) in Germany claimed that \"the British committed a bombing Holocaust against the Germans in Dresden\". They also described the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe as an expulsion Holocaust. Heni criticized German scholars who doubted the Holocaust's uniqueness (including Jörg Friedrich, Martin Walser and sociologist Wolfgang Sofsky) for contributing to these views. Heni also thought some \"left-wing\" academics (like Ward Churchill, Robert Kurz, Noam Chomsky, and John Mearsheimer) had trivialized the Holocaust. He said these scholars had accused Jews of \"controlling America's government to support Israel\", using tropes like \"US-Jewish leaders\" and \"Israel lobby\". * * * * * * ===Manfred Gerstenfeld=== Historian Dr. Manfred Gerstenfeld (d. 2021) criticized scholars who rejected the Holocaust's uniqueness. He called their behavior \"historical manipulation\". He believed that they had encouraged antisemitism in academia. ===Ingo Elbe=== Philosopher Ingo Elbe (1972 – ) wrote that \"the battle against Israel is being fought [indirectly] through attacks on German memory culture and its supposed [narrow-mindedness].\" He criticized the idea that focusing on the Holocaust's uniqueness will make others' suffering seem less important. ===Wolfgang Benz=== German historian Wolfgang Benz (1941 – ) considered the Holocaust \"a unique crime in the history of mankind\". ===Annette F. Timm=== Canadian historian Annette F. Timm considered the Holocaust unique due to the Nazis' \"[complete] rejection of any single Jewish person from being assimilated\". This contributed to their decision to kill every Jew they could identify, Timm wrote. ===Christian Davies=== In a 2019 article, British journalist Christian Davies criticized Polish nationalists who said the Holocaust was not unique because the Nazis committed a \"separate Holocaust against ethnic Poles\" after occupying Poland. These nationalists claimed the Poles \"suffered equally as Jews\" because they disliked the international attention the Holocaust had received, according to Davies. Between the 2000s and 2023, many people spread Holocaust misinformation on Wikipedia. * * * * * Dozens of Holocaust-related articles were rewritten to invent Jewish \"war crimes\" against Poles, downplay Polish cooperation with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, exaggerate Jewish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, and blame Jews for their own suffering in the Holocaust. ==Objection to Holocaust uniqueness== Objections to the Holocaust's uniqueness have historically been associated with Holocaust denial. * * * Such objections are found to be one of the most common themes of Holocaust deniers' propaganda. For historians not known to have held antisemitic views, they objected to the Holocaust's uniqueness by accusing the concept of being \"Eurocentric\", * * * * * even though Jews are not European. * Lappin, Shalom (2006), ‘How Class Disappeared from Western Politics’, Dissent, Vol. 51, No. 1, pp. 73-78. * * * * Kirsch, Adam (2024), On Settler Colonialism: Ideology, Violence, and Justice, W.W. Norton and Company, New York and London. * ===Institute for Historical Review=== The Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a self-declared academic group that has been promoting Holocaust denial since 1978, is noted for rejecting the Holocaust's uniqueness. In several of its papers, the IHR compared the Holocaust to Allied bombings of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. While claiming to be neutral, the IHR promotes the antisemitic trope that \"the Holocaust was invented by Jews to further Jewish-Zionist interests\". The IHR also alleges that \"Nazi Germany actively supported Zionism\" by presenting relevant history without context. IHR's rejection of the Holocaust's uniqueness is shared by figures across the political spectrum. For instance, former London mayor Ken Livingstone (1945 – ), who was a British Labour Party member until 2018, rejected the Holocaust's uniqueness in a similar manner to the IHR, so did PA's leader * * * * * * and American Trotskyist activist writer Lenni Brenner (1937 – ) who published a book endorsing the claim. * * * * * * * * * * ===Richard C. Lukas=== Richard C. Lukas (1937 – ) is an American scholar rejecting the Holocaust's uniqueness.Richard Lukas, The Forgotten Holocaust (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1986). David Engel, “Poles, Jews, and Historical Objectivity,” Slavic Review, vol. 46, no. 3/4 (1987): pp. 568–80. In his 1986 book The Forgotten Holocaust, Lukas claimed that a \"separate Holocaust against ethnic Poles\" had happened under Nazi occupation. Lukas also tried to expand the definition of the Holocaust to include every other group targeted by the Nazi Germans, arguing that \"Jewish historians\" were \"controlling Holocaust history\". David Engel, a Holocaust historian, wrote a 30-page article in the journal Slavic Review to criticize his claims, pointing out that Lukas invented facts, ignored archival sources and failed to assess secondary sources. Those sharing Lukas' rejection of the Holocaust's uniqueness are also found to have caused significant disruptions to the English Wikipedia between the 2000s and 2023, when they coordinated to rewrite dozens of Holocaust- related articles to invent Jewish \"atrocities\" against Poles, downplay Polish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, exaggerate Jewish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers and blame Jews for their own suffering in the Holocaust. Lukas defended the Wikipedia users involved, repeating his false claim that \"Jewish historians\" were \"controlling Holocaust history\". ===Pierre Guillaume=== Pierre Guillaume (1940 – 2023), a French ultra-left anarcho- Marxist activist, rejected the Holocaust's uniqueness. * * * Guillaume argued that the Holocaust was \"no different\" from any other racially motivated massacres in history, going as far as calling the Holocaust \"a distraction from class struggle\" that \"played into the hands of Zionism and Stalinism\". Despite being left-wing, Guillaume's views were adopted by the French far right, many of whom also believed that the Holocaust was \"no different\" from the alleged Judean massacres of the Canaanites or the Native American genocide. They believed that Jewish claims of the Holocaust's uniqueness are \"excuses for extorting compensations from European countries. ===David Duke=== David Duke (1950 – ), leader of the White supremacist group Ku Klux Klan (KKK) between 1974 and 1980, also rejected the Holocaust's uniqueness. On December 11 – 13, 2006, Duke attended a Holocaust-denying conference in Iran upon invitation from Iran's regime. In expressing his rejection of the Holocaust's uniqueness, Duke accused \"Zionists [of] weaponizing the Holocaust to deny the rights of the Palestinians\". He went on to argue that \"[T]he Holocaust [...] is the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder.\" ==Related pages== * Polish Memory Law * Historical revisionism * Secondary antisemitism ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Antisemitism Category:The Holocaust Category:Antisemitism in Germany",
