They have a reputation for casual and friendly atmosphere, hearty food and drink, Irish sports, and traditional Irish music. Most pubs on the island of Ireland are independently owned and licensed. There are about 7,000 Irish themed pubs in the rest of the world. Guinness is generally advertised. The Irish Pub Company works with the brewery and runs some of them. == References == Category:Places where alcohol is served Category:Irish culture",
