 "text": "The Holocaust, also called HaShoah (), was the genocide of Jews in Europe by Nazi Germany, other Axis powers and local collaborators in occupied territories between 1933 and 1945. * * * * At least 6,000,000 Jews (67% pre- war European Jews) were killed in the Holocaust. ==Overview== The Nazis called themselves Übermensch (\"master race\") and wanted to kill every Jew in Europe. In an organized, planned and deliberate way, they murdered around six million Jews and five million others who were not part of the \"master race\". The Nazis persecuted Jews and other groups in many ways. They forced many Jews to live in ghettos. They deported millions of people to forced labor camps and concentration camps. To allow them to kill as quickly as possible, they built death camps with gas chambers that could kill up to 2,000 people at a time. ===European Jewry=== In 1933, around 9,500,000 Jewish people lived in Europe. (This was less than 2% of Europe's total population.) By 1945, nearly two out of every three Jews in Europe had been killed in the Holocaust. Every Jewish community in Nazi-occupied Europe lost people during the Holocaust. ==Definition== As per the Holocaust Encyclopedia, run by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), As per the Yad Vashem, As per the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, As per the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), ==Camps and ghettos== The Nazis established around 44,000 concentration camps, death camps, and ghettos in Nazi-controlled parts of Europe and North Africa during World War II. ===Ghettos=== By mid-1941, the Nazis had forced almost all Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland into ghettos. The largest of these was the Warsaw Ghetto. In November 1940, the Nazis forced 380,000 Jews into the ghetto and locked them in. Over 80,000 of them died from starvation, overcrowding, disease, freezing to death, and other terrible conditions. The second largest, the Lodz Ghetto, held around 210,000 people in total. In this ghetto, more than one in every five people died from the terrible living conditions. According to Leo Schneiderman, who survived the Lodz Ghetto: \"The whole ghetto was designed, actually, to starve the people out.\" ===Concentration camps=== There were 23 main concentration camps and hundreds of sub-camps throughout the lands that Nazi Germany controlled. According to Karin Orth in the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos: 1933-1945, as many as one thousand camps may have operated at a time. The Nazis used concentration camps for many purposes: to gather and isolate the Nazis' \"enemies\"; to punish and torture these \"enemies\"; to obtain forced labor; to steal victims' belongings on a massive scale; to perform medical experiments on prisoners; and to kill people. Major concentration camps included: * Auschwitz * Bergen-Belsen, where Anne Frank was killed * Buchenwald * Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp * Mauthausen * Ravensbruck, a camp for female prisoners * Sachsenhausen ===Death camps=== The Nazis established six death camps in Poland. Their sole purpose was to kill Jews as quickly and efficiently as possible.The death camps were: * Auschwitz * Belzec * Chelmno * Majdanek * Sobibor * Treblinka ==Methods== ===Mass murder=== Special Schutzstaffel (SS) units like the Einsatzgruppen killed hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of Jews at a time in mass shootings. Sometimes they forced Jews and other prisoners to dig giant holes in the ground where, after days of hard work, they were shot. Their bodies were buried and burned in mass graves. At Babi Yar in Kyiv, Ukraine, Einsatzgruppen killed 33,771 Jews in two days, between 29-30 September 1941. The Nazis continued to use Babi Yar for mass executions of Jews, Soviet prisoners or war, and Roma people throughout the war. As many as 100,000 people may have died there. ===Poison gas=== The Nazis first used gas chambers to kill people as part of their T4 Project (Aktion T4). The Nazis believed in eugenics and thought that people with disabilities, chronically ill people, and many elderly people were \"useless eaters.\" To eliminate these people, the Nazis sent them to killing centers like Hartheim Killing Facility, where they murdered them in gas chambers. According to the Britannica, When they first used poison gas to kill Jews, the Nazis used gas vans that piped carbon monoxide into the passenger compartment. Soon, though, the Nazis built permanent gas chambers where they killed up to 2000 people at a time. By 1942 the Nazi's main method of murdering people in concentration camps was to kill them in gas chambers with Zyklon-B. This was a rat poison which had cyanide. In a planned, organized, and methodical way, they deported trains full of people to the extermination camps and sent them straight to the gas chambers. The Nazis killed around 1,100,000 people in concentration camp gas chambers using Zyklon-B. ===Other methods=== The Nazis executed many people by shooting, stabbing, or beating them to death. Some people survived beatings, but suffered broken bones and/or died when their wounds got infected. Many people also died in forced marches from one camp to another. Some were killed in medical experiments by SS doctors like Josef Mengele. Others were worked to death. The Nazis also deliberately killed prisoners in some concentration camps by treating them so terribly that many died. They forced prisoners to do hard forced labor, but fed them very little (about 25% of the calories needed to survive). In the winter, prisoners did not have warm clothing or heating, and many froze to death. Others developed frostbite, which sometimes worsened into gangrene. Diseases spread quickly in the camps because there was no healthcare, no sanitation, and a lot of overcrowding. Lice were everywhere, and they spread typhus, which was \"ever- present, both endemic and epidemic, [and] fatal\". Other illnesses were common, including tuberculosis, malaria, meningitis, scabies, pneumonia, and diarrheal diseases. Prisoners who were too sick or injured to work were often killed. ==Deaths== The Nazis killed at least 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust. ===Jews=== 67% European Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, including at least 3,000,000 Polish Jews. The Holocaust killed almost all of the Jewish children in Europe. Before World War II, there were about 1,600,000 Jewish children living in the lands that the Nazis would soon control. Only 6% to 11% of them survived World War II; between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 died. (The adult survival rate was at least three times higher: 33%.) Most European Jews had already been killed by 1943 before the Allies received reliable reports of the mass extermination. As per the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), * 2,700,000 Jews were killed at death camps * 2,000,000 Jews were killed in mass shootings and other massacres * 800,000 to 1,000,000 Jews were killed in ghettos, forced labor camps and concentration camps * 250,000 Jews were killed in other acts of violence, including tortures, pogroms, death marches etc. The approximate proportions of Jews killed are as follows. * 90% of Jews in Poland * * * * 83–87% of Jews in Greece * * * * 81% of Jews in Yugoslavian territories occupied by the Independent State of CroatiaCroatian: Nezavisna Država Hrvatska (NDH) * * * * * 75% of Jews in the Netherlands * 68% of Jews in Hungary * * * * * * 66% of Jews in Belgium * 53% of Jews in Romania * * * * 33% of Jews in France ===Other victims of Nazism=== Beyond the Holocaust, other victims of Nazism included: Summary Groups * 3,300,000 Soviet prisoners of war * 1,800,000 non-Jewish Poles * 250,000 to 500,000 Roma people * 310,000 Serb civilians murdered by the Ustaša regime of the Independent State of Croatia * 250,000 to 300,000 disabled people, including over 10,000 children * 35,000 Germans imprisoned as \"professional criminals\" and \"asocials\" * Tens of thousands of Germans who opposed the Nazi tyranny ==Motives== Between the 1st century the Holocaust, antisemitism had been a significant problem in Europe. Many people wrongly thought that all Jews became rich by stealing money from others, like Christians. Many believed Jews only liked other Jews. Since at least the 2nd century BC, people have levelled a range of false accusations against Jews, including the blood libel – the lie that Jews are taking blood from Christian kids. These beliefs were not true and were based on stereotypes. However, these beliefs were popular in the German-speaking world and elsewhere in the late 1800s. Adolf Hitler was born in Austria during this time, when many people disliked Jews. He may have been jealous of Jewish success in Austria. However, in his book Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"), he said it was the Jews' fault that Germany and Austria lost World War I. He also said Germany's economic problems were the Jews' fault. Many people agreed with Hitler’s ideas and supported him as the leader of the Nazi Party. Also, the Nazis justified the Holocaust with conspiracy theories based on self-victimization and inversion of reality. They accused Jews of controlling the world and blamed every problem on them. American historian Jeffrey Herf wrote in his book The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda during World War II and the Holocaust: Contrary to common perception, Herf said that Nazis' view of the Jews being an inferior race was not the motive for the Holocaust. Instead, it was the stereotype of Jews being an \"all-powerful anti-German force\" that made the Holocaust happen: American legal scholar Kenneth L. Marcus presented the concept Accusation in a Mirror (AiM) to describe the tendency of genocide criminals – from Nazi Germans to Hutu nationalists – to accuse their victims of seeking a genocide against them in order to justify a genocide themselves. In psychology, such behaviour is called projection. ===Righteous Among the Nations=== On the other hand, Some persons saved Jews during the Holocaust because they thought it was the right thing to do. Some of them were later given Righteous Among the Nations awards by Yad Vashem. ==Holocaust denial== Some extremists, both on the far right and far left in the political spectrum, say the Holocaust did not happen or was not as bad as it is said to be. This is called Holocaust denial, or Holocaust distortion. Many Holocaust deniers say that the Nazis did not kill so many victims. Instead, they claim many of them died because they were ill or starving. However, a significant amount of evidence proves that Holocaust deniers are wrong. Jews were killed because Hitler ordered it. In Germany and some other countries, it is criminal to deny the Holocaust.\"Push for EU Holocaust denial ban\", BBC News, January 15, 2007. Retrieved May 13, 2010. ===Definition=== Contrary to public misconceptions, Holocaust denial does not only mean denying that the Holocaust happened. Instead, it also includes the following acts: > # Intentional efforts to excuse or minimize the impact of the Holocaust or > its principal elements, including collaborators and allies of Nazi Germany; > # Gross minimization of the number of the victims of the Holocaust in > contradiction to reliable sources; # Attempts to blame the Jews for causing > their own genocide; # Statements that cast the Holocaust as a positive > historical event. Those statements are not Holocaust denial but are closely > connected to it as a radical form of antisemitism. > IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or > justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology > or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, > demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of > Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about > a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, > government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of > being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single > Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying > the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the > genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and > its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * > Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or > exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal > to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the > interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to > self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of > Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it > a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using > the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of > Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * > Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * > Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. > They may suggest that the Holocaust did not go far enough in accomplishing > its goal of “the Final Solution of the Jewish Question”; # Attempts to blur > the responsibility for the establishment of concentration and death camps > devised and operated by Nazi Germany by putting blame on other nations or > ethnic groups. For instance, someone acknowledging that the Holocaust happened while denying the Nazi use of poison gas is also a Holocaust denier. ===Recent trend=== A trend of Holocaust distortion, some state-sponsored, is also seen in other European countries, including Austria, Croatia, * * * * * Czechia, Hungary, * * * Germany, Italy, Poland, * Robert Rozett, “Competitive Victimhood and Holocaust Distortion,” The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, XVI (2022); “Distorting the Holocaust and Whitewashing History: Toward a Typology,” XIII: 1 (2019); Yehuda Bauer, “Creating a “Usable” Past: On Holocaust Denial and Distortion,” XIV: 2 (2022); and Jan Grabowski, “The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'” X: 3 (2016). * Joanna Beata Michlic, “The Politics of the Memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland: Reflections on the Current Misuses of the History of Rescue,” Jewish Historical Studies—Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England, LIII: 1 (2022); Piotr Forecki, Po Jedwabnem: Anatomia pamięci funkcjonalnej (Kraków, 2018); Jan Gross, Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne (Princeton, 2001). * Piotr Forecki, “Domestic ‘Assassins of Memory’: Various Faces of Holocaust Revisionism in Contemporary Poland,” presentation at a symposium in honor of Professor Antony Polonsky called “The Holocaust in Eastern Europe: sources, memory, politics,” March 16, 2021, UCL, London. * * Antony Polonsky and Joanna Beata Michlic (eds.), The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland (Princeton, 2009) and Laurence Weinbaum, “Amnesia and Antisemitism in the ‘Second Jagiellonian Age,’” Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and Delegitimizing Israel, Robert Wistrich (ed.)

Some described the phenomenon with the concept mnemonic politics, where nationalist governments distorted the Holocaust by framing their ethnic majority as the victims rather than the Jews or Roma.Kónczal, Kornelia, and Moses, A.

Some of those propaganda does not deny that the Holocaust happened. Instead, it casts doubt on the Holocaust's nature, ignores the historical context leading up to the Holocaust, and abusively compares the Holocaust to other historical events. Those propagandists do this to whitewash the Holocaust and dehumanize Holocaust victims so as to whitewash Nazi antisemitism and justify the mass murder of Jews. Such behavior is rejected by mainstream historians, including Emil Fackenheim, Yehuda Bauer, Deborah Lipstadt and Daniel Goldhagen. Antisemites often accuse Jews of \"owning the Holocaust\" or \"extorting compensation from European governments\", and rewrite the Holocaust's history to inflate Jewish collaboration with Nazi Germans so as to blame Jews for their own suffering. * * * * * * * * These false claims are common on social media, especially Reddit * * * * * and English Wikipedia. ==Related pages== * Holodomor * Rwandan genocide * Cambodian genocide * Secondary antisemitism * Double genocide theory ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Genocide Category:World War II Category:Antisemitism Category:Jewish history Category:History of Europe Category:Genocides in Europe Category:Crimes against humanity",
