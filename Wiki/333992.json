 "text": "In mathematics, the norm of a vector is its length. A vector is a mathematical object that has a size, called the magnitude, and a direction. For the real numbers, the only norm is the absolute value. For spaces with more dimensions, the norm can be any function p with the following three properties: # Scales for real numbers a, that is, p(ax) = |a|p(x). # Function of sum is less than sum of functions, that is, p(x + y) \\leq p(x) + p(y) (also known as the triangle inequality). # p(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. == Definition == For a vector x, the associated norm is written as ||x||_p, or Lp where p is some value. The value of the norm of x with some length N is as follows: ||x||_p = \\sqrt[p]{|x_1|^p+|x_2|^p+...+|x_N|^p} The most common usage of this is the Euclidean norm, also called the standard distance formula. == Examples == # The one-norm is the sum of absolute values: \\|x\\|_1 = |x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_N|. This is like finding the distance from one place on a grid to another by summing together the distances in all directions the grid goes; see Manhattan Distance. # Euclidean norm (also called L2-norm) is the sum of the squares of the values: \\|x\\|_2 = \\sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_N^2} # Maximum norm is the maximum absolute value: \\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\max(|x_1|,|x_2|,...,|x_N|) #When applied to matrices, the Euclidean norm is referred to as the Frobenius norm. # L0 norm is the number of non-zero elements present in a vector. == Related pages == * Magnitude (mathematics) == References == Category:Linear algebra Category:Geometry Category:Mathematical analysis",
