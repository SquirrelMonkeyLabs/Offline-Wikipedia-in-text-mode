 "text": "The Newfoundland Growlers were a Canadian professional ice hockey team. They began playing in 2018 and ended in 2024. The team played in the ECHL. They played their home games in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador at the Mary Brown's Centre. They were the ECHL affiliate for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). They were also the affiliates for the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League (AHL). On March 13, 2018, the new ECHL team was approved by the ECHL and would be owned by the same owners of the St. John's Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada). The approval was delayed at first because of a dispute over arena rights. On June 14, 2018, an affiliation between the Growlers and the Toronto Maple Leafs was announced. On October 12, 2018, the team would play their first game as the Newfoundland Growlers. They would defeat the Florida Everblades 3–2 in front of a soldout arena. The team would be successful in their first season in the league. They would lead the North Division. They finished with 43 wins, 21 losses, and 94 points and would make it all the way to the Kelly Cup finals. They would end up winning the Kelly Cup after they defeated the Toledo Walleye four games to two. The Growlers were also successful in the 2022–23 season, again topping the North Division. They finished with 48 wins, 22 losses, and 98 points. They would make it to the Eastern Conference finals but would be defeated by the eventual champion Florida Everblades four games to two. On April 2, 2024, the team was terminated by the ECHL. They were terminated because they could not properly complete the league's bylaws. Players on the team were released as unrestricted free agents. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2018 establishments in Canada Category:2024 disestablishments Category:Defunct sports teams Category:ECHL teams Category:St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Toronto Maple Leafs",
