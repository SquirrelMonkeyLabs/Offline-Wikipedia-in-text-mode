The scenes of fields are similar to those that are in the music video for \"We Found Love\", which is also a collaboration between Rihanna and Harris. Some critics viewed the changing colors and cube background to be similar to the music video for Canadian rapper Drake's 2015 single \"Hotline Bling\".
