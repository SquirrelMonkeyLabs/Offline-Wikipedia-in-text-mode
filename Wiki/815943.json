 "text": "Lemlei Ngaleima () or Ngareima () is the goddess and the divine female personification of the fishes and the aquatic life in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). She is a sister (or friend) of the goddesses, Phouoibi, Thumleima and Ereima (Ireima). == Etymology == The Meitei female given name \"Ngaleima\" (ꯉꯥꯂꯩꯃ) is made up of two words. The two words are \"Nga\" (ꯉꯥ) and \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ). \"Nga\" (ꯉꯥ) has multiple meanings. It may mean to incline or to lean in verbal form. It means fish in noun form. Here, the word \"Nga\" (ꯉꯥ) refers to \"fish\". The word \"Leima\" (ꯂꯩꯃ) means queen, mistress or lady. == Myths == Menstrual blood, charoo (hay, dried paddy stalks), hentak (edible fish paste), sumjit (broom) are considered unholy to Goddess Ngaleima. So, if there is an adverse entry of fish into the fishing nets, the presence of menstruating woman is highly suspected at the spot, especially on the floating dam. Other suspicious reasons are the dropping down of the charoo (hay, dried paddy stalks) or hentak (edible fish paste) or sumjit (broom) by people out of jealousy into the place. == Association with other deities == Goddess Ngaleima (Ngareima) is considered to be one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimalel), the supreme mother earth goddess. It is said that Leimalel becomes Ngaleima when she is in the fish yard. == In popular culture == * Phou-oibi, the rice goddess is a 2009 ballad opera performed by the Laihui Ensemble. It is based on the story of the goddess and her sister Phouoibi. * Phouoibi Shayon is a 2017 Manipuri mythology movie based on the story of the goddess and her sister Phouoibi. == Gallery == Aquatic Meitei Goddess Ngaleima — Divine Queen & Mother Goddess of all the fishes in the world — Glimpse of ancient Kangleipak civilisation (early Manipur realm).jpg Basic illustration of primordial Meitei Goddess Ngaleima — Divine Queen & Mother Goddess of all the fishes in the world — Glimpse of ancient Kangleipak civilisation (early Manipur realm).jpg Deific Meitei Lady Ngaleima — Divine Queen & Mother Goddess of all the fishes in the world — Glimpse of ancient Kangleipak civilisation (early Manipur realm).jpg == Related pages == * Imoinu (Emoinu) - Meitei goddess of wealth * Ireima (Ereima) - Meitei goddess of water * Leimarel (Leimalel) - Meitei goddess of earth * Panthoibi - Meitei goddess of civilization, love and warfare * Phouoibi (Phouleima) - Meitei goddess of agricultural crops * Thumleima - Meitei goddess of salt == References == == Other websites == * Ngaleima_archive.org Category:Meitei gods and goddesses Category:Leima Category:Gods and goddesses of water Category:Virgin goddesses",
