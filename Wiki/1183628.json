Thirty-seven soldiers were killed in the operation, including a captain and several non-commissioned officers. Guerrilla fighter Şervan Varto was killed in the operation. Given the scale of the operation, the People's Defense Center (NPG) command issued a statement to the fighters involved: \"First and foremost, we greet you, dear comrades, who participated in the revolutionary operation \"Şehîd Doğa Viyan\" with the most sincere revolutionary sentiments, with a sense of apoist sacrifice and great courage. We remember with respect and gratitude the valuable apoist Fedai comrade Şervan Varto, who fought courageously in the revolutionary operation and fell.
