Douglas, an Illinois politician, whose estate included a tract of land given to the federal government. Camp Douglas, a Civil War camp, was located in what is now the eastern portion of the Douglas neighborhood. Douglas gave that part of his estate at Cottage Grove and 35th to the Old University of Chicago. The Chicago 2016 Olympic bid planned for the Olympic Village to be constructed on a truck parking lot south of McCormick Place that is mostly in the Douglas community area and partly in the Near South Side. ==References== Category:Community areas of Chicago",
