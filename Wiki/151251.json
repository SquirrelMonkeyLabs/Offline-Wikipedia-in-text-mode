 "text": "The George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, commonly known as the George Foreman Grill, is an indoor, electrically-heated grill manufactured by Salton, Inc. George Foreman, a former champion boxer, is the main spokesperson for the grill. Since its introduction in 1994, over 80 million Foreman grills have been sold. ==Reception== Foreman has made over 150 million dollars from the sales of his grills, an amount that is more than he earned as a boxer. The company has created many different sizes and designs for the grill since it was first made. These include \"The Champ\" which was the first grill produced, a family size grill, and a \"Super Large\" grill that has 144 inches of grilling space. There is also a deep fryer and roaster. A website made an April Fools' Day joke by claiming to sell a USB version of the grill called the \"iGrill.\" The fake product was advertised as a grill that can be plugged into a computer and turned on by someone on the Internet. ==Design== The grill is designed to heat the top and bottom surfaces of the food, so the food does not need to be flipped while cooking. Both heating surfaces are grooved to reduce the contact area, and covered in a non-stick coating. The lower heating surface is angled to allow liquid fat and other fluids to drain through the grooves into a removable drip tray that also shows the amount removed from the food. This design has been marketed as a way to \"knock out the fat\", to appear as a healthier way to cook food. ==References== Category:Cooking appliances",
