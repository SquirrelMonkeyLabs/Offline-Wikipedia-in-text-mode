It is a colubrid, the largest family of snakes, found on every continent except Antarctica. Boomslangs eat small animals like chameleons, frogs, and birds, and they also eat eggs. Like all snakes, boomslangs do not chew they swallow everything whole. The venom of boomslangs can disrupt the clotting of blood, and this can kill a person. Even a small scratch can be fatal. After a bite, one can sometimes feel a headache, nausea, sleepiness, and get a mental disorder. This does not happen often, as boomslangs only bite humans when they feel attacked.

A boomslang is a slender snake with large eyes on a large blunt head. The snake can grow to up to 2 metres long, but is on average about 1 to 1.6 m in length. == References == Category:Venomous animals Category:Colubrids Category:Reptiles of Africa",
