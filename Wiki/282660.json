 "text": "Sprint Nextel Corporation () was a telecommunications company based in Overland Park, Kansas. It operated under the name Sprint, and was once the fourth largest wireless telecommunications network in the United States behind Verizon, AT&T; and T-Mobile, with 56.3 million customers, behind Verizon Wireless and AT&T; Mobility. On April 1, 2020, T-Mobile and Sprint merged, with T-Mobile now being the whole owner of Sprint, making Sprint an effective subsidiary of T-Mobile until the Sprint brand was officially phased out. Leadership, background, and stock changes happened immediately, with customer side changes happening over time. Sprint was officially discontinued on August 2, 2020. Billing was already showing the T-Mobile brand, and on this date all retail, customer service, and all other company branding was replaced by T-Mobile. New rate plans were also introduced as well for all new and existing customers from both companies, though they will all will remain with their current plan, if they choose not to switch to a new T-Mobile plan for at least 3 years. ==References== Category:American telephone companies Category:Overland Park, Kansas Category:1937 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Kansas Category:Companies based in Kansas",
