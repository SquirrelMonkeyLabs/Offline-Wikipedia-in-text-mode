 "text": "A exotic pet is a rare or unusual animal which is kept as a pet. It is kept in human households but is relatively unusual or usually thought of as a wild animal rather than as a pet. \"Exotic\" often refers to a species which is not native (indigenous) to where the owner lives, or an animal that isn't typically kept as a pet (unlike cats or dogs). \"Pet\" is a companion animal living with people.\"A framework for assessing the suitability of different species as companion animals, Appendix C \"; Animal Welfare 2000, 9:359-372, p. 360 pet animal, as defined by the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals (Council of Europe 1987) as: animals sharing man's companionship and in particular living in his household. ==Some animals kept as exotic pets== A wide variety of animals have been kept as pets.
