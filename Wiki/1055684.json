 "text": "Religion and morality are not the same thing. There is often a link between morality and religion but this is not always true. The religion of a person will often affect the moral values of that person. Most religions have ideas as to what is right or wrong, or how a person should behave in a given situation. Most civilizations also have a moral code that that group of people find acceptable. These two codes are not always the same. Religion are often built around on morality. They will often develop alongside morality, but morality does not always depend upon religion. People who do not follow a religion also have moral values. In some cases, political leaders say what people should see as right or wrong. Philosophical frameworks such as consequentialism, freethought, utilitarianism and humanism also have a moral component. None of these are influenced by religion. == References == Category:Religion Category:Ethics",
