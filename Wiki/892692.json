 "text": "The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is a ligament in each knee of humans and many other animals. It works as a counterpart to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). It connects the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia to the medial condyle of the femur. This allows the PCL to resist forces pushing the tibia posteriorly relative to the femur. The PCL gets its name by attaching to the posterior portion of the tibia.Saladin, K. S. 2010. Anatomy & Physiology: 5th edition. McGraw-Hill The PCL, ACL, MCL, and LCL are the four main ligaments of the knee in primates. ==References== Category:Skeletal system",
