 "text": "Immigrant health care in the United States means the services that help \"immigrants\" stay healthy. An immigrant is someone who comes to live in the U.S. but is not a citizen yet. This group includes people with legal status, refugees, and those without legal documents. == Health Care Differences == Health care for immigrants is different from health care for U.S. citizens. Immigrants often face more challenges when getting medical care. These challenges include not having health insurance, high costs, and rules that limit care for people without legal documents. Some immigrants also have trouble because of language differences or fear of discrimination. Sometimes, health care and immigration rules affect immigrants in special ways. For example, immigrants held in detention centers get health care there, but it is not always good quality. In some cases, very sick immigrants may be sent back to their home countries. This is called medical deportation. The U.S. government has made different rules over the years about health care for immigrants. These rules often change depending on politics. People continue to talk about how immigrants should get health care and what the government should do to help them. == References == Category:Healthcare in the United States",
