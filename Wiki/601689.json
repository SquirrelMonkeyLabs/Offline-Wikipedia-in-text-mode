Museveni is well known for being anti–democracy and as well as anti–homosexuality. He is one of Africa's longest serving leaders. His rule had brought many changes in Uganda.

On 16 January 2021, Museveni was re-elected for a sixth term with 58.6% of the vote, despite many videos and reports that show ballot box stuffing, over 400 polling stations with 100% voter turnout, and human rights violations.
