As part of the Compromise of 1850, the new state of Texas gave up the Oklahoma Panhandle. Between 1850 and 1890, the area did not belong to any state or territory. In 1886, a group of settlers in the area formed their own government, and named the Oklahoma Panhandle the Cimarron Territory. Many of these settlers were from Beaver City. The territory was never recognized by the United States government. The area was assigned to the new Oklahoma Territory in May 1890. The State of Oklahoma was formed in 1907. == Places == === Towns === *Beaver (county seat) *Forgan *Gate *Knowles === Other === *Balko *Elmwood *Floris *Mocane *Slapout *Turpin == References == Category:Oklahoma counties Category:1890 establishments in Oklahoma Territory",
