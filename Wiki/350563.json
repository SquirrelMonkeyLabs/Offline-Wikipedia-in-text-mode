 "text": "Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane (July 23, 1773 â€“ January 27, 1860) was the sixth Governor of New South Wales. Brisbane was very interested in astronomy and brought two assistant astronomers to Australia with him. When he went back to England, he left his books, telescopes and other equipment behind as gift, and these were the beginnings of the Sydney Observatory. The Brisbane River was named after Sir Thomas, and the capital city of Queensland, takes its name from the river. == References == Category:1773 births Category:1860 deaths Category:British Army officers Category:British astronomers Category:Governors of New South Wales Category:Scottish politicians Category:People from Ayrshire",
