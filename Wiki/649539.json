 "text": "On 30 June 2018, two British nationals, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, were admitted to hospital in Amesbury, England. Police determined that they were poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent similar to that used in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, away, almost four months earlier. Sturgess died on 8 July, and Rowley regained consciousness two days later. The origin of the poison was possibly a perfume bottle they had picked up in a park. ==References== Category:2018 crimes in Europe Category:2010s crimes in the United Kingdom Category:June 2018 events Category:Wiltshire Category:2018 in the United Kingdom",
