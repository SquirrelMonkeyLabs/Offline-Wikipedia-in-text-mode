He was the first Westerner (person from the Western Hemisphere) to visit the higher parts of the Niger River. In January 1806, on his second journey to explore the River Nigeria, his boat was overwhelmed in a native attack and in an attempt to escape, he jumped into the river and got drowned, ending his life at the age of 35. ==Other websites== Category:1771 births Category:1806 deaths Category:Accidental deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Boating accident deaths Category:Scottish explorers Category:People from Scottish Borders",
