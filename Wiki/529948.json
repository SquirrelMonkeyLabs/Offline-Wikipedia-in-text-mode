 "text": "Zināʾ (زِنَاء) or zina (زِنًى or زِنًا) is an Islamic law concerning unlawful sexual relations between male and female. Historically, sexual relations with concubines, who are known as “those whom your right hands possess” in the Qur'an, was permissible in Islam. However, most modern Muslims believe that Islam no longer permits concubinage and that sexual relations are religiously permissible only within marriage. In modern times, the term zina often refers to sexual relations between males and females who are not married to one another through a nikah,R.

The last two types of prosecutions are uncommon. Most cases of zina in the history of Islam have been pregnant unmarried women.Kecia Ali (2006), Sexual Ethics and Islam, , Chapter 4M. Tamadonfar (2001), Islam, law, and political control in contemporary Iran, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 40(2): 205-220 In some schools of Islamic law, a pregnant woman accused of zina who denies sex was consensual must prove she was raped with four eye-witnesses testifying before the court. This has led to many cases where rape victims have been punished for zina.A.

The name has a different linguistic root (Greek xen-). It also has a different meaning (\"guest, stranger\"), is pronounced differently (either Zīnah or Zaynah), and is usually spelled differently. == References == Category:Islamic culture Category:Sexual law",
