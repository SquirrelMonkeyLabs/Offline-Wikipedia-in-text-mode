Tektites are gravel-sized bodies composed of black, green, brown, or grey natural glass. They are formed from terrestrial debris ejected by meteorite impacts.French, B.M. 1998.

Australian Regolith and Clays Conference, Mildura, 7â€“10 February 2012. It includes most of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Southern China). The material from the impact stretches across the ocean to include the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Java. It also reaches far west out into the Indian Ocean, and south to Australia and Tasmania. Since the 1960s, it has been accepted that the strewn field included Hainan in southern China to Australia or about 10% of the Earth's surface. This was later extended by finds in Africa and Tasmania to 20%. Recent additional finds in northern Tibet and Guangxi increased the strewnfield to about 30% of the Earth's surface, or almost 150 million km2, or about the size of the entire world's landmass. The glass comes from the melting of local rocks due to the impact of a large meteorite. The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression in Tasmania known as Darwin Crater. The crater is filled with 230 metres of sediments and breccia. A crater of that size would be caused by a meteorite 20 to 50 metres in diameter. == References == Category:Impact events Category:Geology",
