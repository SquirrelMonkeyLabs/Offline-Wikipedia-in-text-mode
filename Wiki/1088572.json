The group has been designated a terrorist group by the UK since late 2005. It was founded in 2003 by former members of Ansar al- Islam who went to Iran after the start of the Iraq War. The group is named as Ansar al-Sunnah as an alias for Ansar al-Islam. The group has also had its name used by small splinter groups in 2014 after the disbandment of Ansar al- Sunnah. ==References== Category:Iraq War Category:Islamist militant groups",
