Its design was based on the Colt M1911. It was manufactured by Fabryka Broni ≈Åucznik Radom. The Vis wz pistol. 35 was mainly used during World War II by the Polish armed forces and also by some German units that captured it. The pistol began production in 1935, later used by the Polish army. When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939 (which led to World War II), they took over production of the weapon for their own forces under the name Pistole 35(p). It was a weapon highly appreciated for its precision and reliability in combat. The Vis is 9mm caliber, with a magazine capacity of 8 cartridges, its effective range is 50 m and it has a single-action trigger. It weighs 920 g without magazine. It is currently appreciated by collectors and gun enthusiasts. Category:pistols",
