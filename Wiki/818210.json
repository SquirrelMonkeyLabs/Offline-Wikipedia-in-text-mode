 "text": "The Sinitic languages, also called the \"Chinese languages\", are a branch of Sino-Tibetan languages spoken mainly in China. Some think there is a split between Sinitic languages and the rest of the family (Tibeto-Burman languages), but many researchers now do not agree with this. Because of this, the Sinitic languages are simply Sino-Tibetan languages that are seen as varieties of Chinese. Many think Chinese is one language with many dialects, when it may be a group of different languages. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:Chinese language Category:Languages of China",
