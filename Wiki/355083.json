 "text": "The Midwife toad (Alytes) is a genus of frogs. They part of the Discoglossidae family. They live in most of Europe and northwestern Africa. They look like toads because of their hard skin. They get their name because they take care of their young on their backs. They help them from not being eaten from hungry animals. When they hatch the frog will go back to the water and allow them to swim away. ==Species== Binomial Name and Author Common Name Alytes cisternasii Iberian Midwife Toad Alytes dickhilleni Betic Midwife Toad Alytes maurus Alytes muletensis Mallorcan midwife toad Alytes obstetricans Common Midwife Toad == Books == * Carl Vogt: Untersuchungen über die Entwicklungsgeschichte der Geburtshelferkröte.
