At the age of eight he had his first appearances in the Mini-championships in Taiwan. As the parents saw the talent of their son, Chuang got a coach and his parents trained him, too. 1993 Chuang travelled to the table tennis capital - China. This moving was no easy decision for his mother Li Gumei. At that time the family Chuang wasn't very rich. Chuang had to train in very hot gyms and sportclubs. The work had success: In 1998 he got to the Taiwanese National team. === First success and changing to Germany (1999-2002) === After getting in the National team he played his first World Tour tournament. At the Austrian Open he reached the quarterfinals in the singles and doubles and made headlines. In 1999 he was nominated by coaches and players to come to Germany. The hard times for mother and son went on. It was difficult for Chuang to be a friend of German table tennis players because he doesn't speak German. He had no assistant for matches or in the training, so he had no coach. But he was very diligent and became very soon the best player in Germany. In 2002 he came back to Taiwan. === More successes and becoming good playing in the adult area (2002-2018) === At several World Tour events he reached the final.

At the bronze medal match he had the chance to win. In a very important match for Chuang he lost 2:4 too and got the fourth place. With the team he got place 5-9. Despite these losses it was Chuang's best placement at Olympics. In 2013 he took part in the World Championships, where he got his best position ever- the quarterfinals. In the doubles he reached the 1st place after beating a Chinese duo in the final. This was the first gold for Taiwan.
