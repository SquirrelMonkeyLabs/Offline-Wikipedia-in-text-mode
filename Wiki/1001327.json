It was released on February 28, 1984 by Rock 'n Roll Records. It was produced by Rick Derringer. It was recorded between October and December 1983. The album's music is parodies of pop and rock music from the 1980s. Yankovic made parody versions of songs by many musicians. Half of the album is parodies of songs other people have made, such as Michael Jackson, Men Without Hats, the Police, and Survivor. The other half of the album is \"style parodies\". This is music that does not parody any song. It parodies the style of music a person makes. The album has style parodies based on Bob Marley and the B-52s. In 3-D is different from Yankovic's first album (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic). The parody songs on the album were more similar to their original songs. Yankovic also did not play the accordion for every song. It is Yankovic's first album with a polka themed mix of popular songs on it. Yankovic has put a polka mix on many albums since In 3-D. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D went to number 17 on the Billboard 200. This is an American music chart. It also went to number 61 on Australian music charts. The album has one of Yankovic's most popular singles on it. It is named \"Eat It\". This single went to number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. This was his highest charting song until 2006. \"Eat It\" was also number one in Australia. This makes it his only number one song in any country. The album had two more singles: \"King of Suede\" and \"I Lost on Jeopardy\". The album was certified platinum by the RIAA. \"Eat It\" won a Grammy Award in 1985. == Track listing == == References == Category:1984 albums Category:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic",
