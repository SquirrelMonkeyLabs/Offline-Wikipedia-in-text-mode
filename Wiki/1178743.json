 "text": "Sci-Hub is an online library similar to Libgen or Anna's Archive. This type of library has been called a \"shadow library\". It holds digital information on the internet, living in countries where they do not follow copyright law enough. The website might have a paper on it which can be searched for, then it gives the person looking to read that paper more information about the topic they want to learn about. The website might not have the paper on it. The website works even if the paper is not free normally. It is simple to use and loads fast because of the simple and lightweight website, but all of the files can be downloaded at once from there. If someone who wants to, has everything they need to do that, they could. Downloading the files all at once has an easier option using a torrent. The main website currently has a list of files that other people are downloading on the main page. Sci-Hub has a large number of books from organizations, businesses that have done studies, and university papers, dissertations, for example. These papers are helpful for learning and doing research. It is a better alternative to just reading the abstract, hoping for an open access (OA) version of the paper, student loans, grants, or asking someone else (like a school work colleague) to get access for you. Currently on their website, it describes itself with its tagline: The goal of Sci-Hub is to provide free and unrestricted access to all scientific knowledge ever published in journal or book form.sci-hub site metadata - websites own metadata (using TLD .mk) To use the website to get papers for free, the user simply has to go to the Sci-Hub homepage and search the link by pasting it in the DOI text box. Sometimes using the name of the file works. The DOI link is in the website link or starts with https://DOI and is a .org link and most of the information uses this DOI format. More information about Sci-Hub can be found on their website \"about\" pages. The Sci-Hub official website can be found on the main Wikipedia page.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub Go to this Wiki article to find the new links. == Reading papers == Using Sci-Hub can be made really easy by taking the link of the website hosting the paper or DOI link. This might look like (example): * https://doi.org/10.1177%2F02666669221144429 * 10.1177%2F02666669221144429 \"Copy\" or CTRL+C the link will take it. Take the link and \"paste\" or CTRL+V it in the box. The \"about\" part of the sci-hub link can be replaced with the DOI link to go straight to the paper. ==References== Category:Libraries Category:Information technology",
