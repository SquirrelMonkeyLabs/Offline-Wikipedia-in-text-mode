 "text": "Captain Britain is the name used by several fictional characters, superheroes and the defenders of Britain in the Marvel Comics universe, and are in many ways the British equivalent of Captain America. The character was created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe, and first appeared in Captain Britain # 1 in October of 1976. However the two characters are very different in origins and ultimate place in the world. The first incarnation of the character is Dr. Brian Braddock, being only one of many such defenders of Britain chosen via a mystical intervention of sorts by Merlyn and his daughter Roma. Captain Britain is devoted to upholding the laws and customs of Britain and defends it against all threats, at first he fought villains of an earthly nature but as the series progressed he would start to fight much more powerful otherworldly threats such as Jim Jaspers. He is also the brother to Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Braddock, also known as \"Psylocke\", who is currently holding the name of Captain Britain while Brian is currently \"Captain Avalon\".
