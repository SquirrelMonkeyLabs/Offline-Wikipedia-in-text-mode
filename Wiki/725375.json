 "text": "Garfield Minus Garfield, also known as Jon Arbuckle, is a comic published on the internet. It was created by Dan Walsh, a technology manager from Dublin, Ireland. It got a lot of attention during 2008. Each comic strip consists of a previous Garfield comic strip with every character except Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle removed. Dan Walsh says he was not the first to come up with this idea, but was the first to make it popular. == Content == Because Garfield is not present, the comic strips mostly show his owner, Jon Arbuckle, interacting with himself instead of Garfield. The comic strip's website calls this \"a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb.\" ==Reception== Garfield creator and artist Jim Davis has said he occasionally reads the comic strip, it fascinates him, and he finds it to be an \"inspired thing to do\". Some variations of the idea have also been created, such as a Garfield Minus Jon Tumblr blog. == Publication == On October 28 2008, Ballantine Books released a Garfield Minus Garfield book in full color, with the original comics alongside the edited ones. It is credited to Jim Davis, who officially allowed it to be published, with an introduction written by Dan Walsh. Most of the content is a section with \"Garfield Minus Garfield Strips by Dan\", ending with \"A word from Jim Davis\" and a small section of Jim Davis' own attempts at making Garfield Minus Garfield comic strips. Paws, Inc. published its own Garfield Minus Garfield from November 3, 2008 to July 21, 2010, and resumed publishing on April 25, 2012. Unlike Dan Walsh's version, Paws, Inc.'s version also includes the original Garfield comic strip underneath. == References == ==Other websites== * * Dan Walsh's personal blog, Travors.com Category:Webcomics Category:Garfield",
