She was the founder of the Religious Sisters of Joseph. She is properly known in the Catholic Church as Saint Mary of the Cross Mary MacKillop. Her parents were Flora MacDonald and Alexander Mackillop, Catholic immigrants from Scotland. Mary was the eldest of eight children. With the help of Julian Tenison-Woods, Mary opened the first free Catholic school in a stable in Penola, South Australia. She joined the sisters of St. Joseph who lived in poverty and committed to equality and owned no property. The sisters provided clothes for the poor so that they could go to school. They also funded hospitals and orphanages. The sisters of St Joseph governed themselves. Category:1842 births Category:1909 deaths Category:Christian saints Category:Australian Christians",
