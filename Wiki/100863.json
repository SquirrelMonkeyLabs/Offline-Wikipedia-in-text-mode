For away games they wear green shirts and shorts. The club was founded in 1881. Tom Cleverley is the current manager. ==History== The club was at first called \"Watford Rovers.\" It changed its name to \"West Hertfordshire\" in 1893, and \"Watford F.C.\" in 1898. Watford won the Southern League in 1915 and joined the Football League in 1920. They stayed in the Football League's bottom division until 1960 when they were promoted to the Third Division as champions. Watford played in the Second Division for the first time in 1969 when Ken Furphy was the manager. Watford are best known for what they did between 1977 and 1987. Singer Elton John bought the club and made Graham Taylor manager in 1977. The team won the Fourth Division in 1978. They then came 2nd in the Third Division in 1979, and 2nd in the Second Division in 1982. Finally, they came 2nd in the First Division in 1983, and Luther Blissett was the league's top scorer. Watford also got to the FA Cup final in 1984. John Barnes, Nigel Callaghan, Tony Coton and Ross Jenkins were among Watford's star players during the period. Taylor left Watford in 1987 and Watford were relegated to the then Second Division the following year. In the last 30 years they have mostly played in the second tier of English football. However, they enjoyed two seasons in the Premier League under Taylor, in his second spell as manager (1999/2000), and Aidy Boothroyd (2006/07), before Slaviša Jokanović again led them to promotion in 2015 to begin their current spell in the top flight. ==League position== Season League Position 2000/01 First Division 9th 2001/02 First Division 14th 2002/03 First Division 13th 2003/04 First Division 16th 2004/05 League Championship 18th 2005/06 League Championship 3rd 2006/07 Premier League 20th 2007/08 League Championship 6th 2008/09 League Championship 13th 2009/10 League Championship 16th 2010/11 League Championship 14th 2011/12 League Championship 11th 2012/13 League Championship 3rd 2013/14 League Championship 13th 2014/15 League Championship 2nd 2015/16 Premier League 13th 2016/17 Premier League 17th 2017/18 Premier League 14th 2018/19 Premier League 11th 2019/20 Premier League 19th 2020/21 League Championship 2nd ===Former position=== ==References== Category:English football clubs Category:Watford Category:1881 establishments in England",
