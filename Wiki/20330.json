After the republic was conquered by the Iranian army in 1947 he was the only one who was not hanged together with president Qazi Muhammad at the Chuwarchira Square in Mahabad in 1947. He was immune because of his religious standing. The journalist and lyric Hemin Mukriyani was his secretary during the republic. ==Literature== *Archie Roosevelt, Jr., \"The Kurdish Republic of Mahabad\" ,Middle East Journal, no. 1 (July 1947), pp. 247-69 Category:Kurdish politicians",
