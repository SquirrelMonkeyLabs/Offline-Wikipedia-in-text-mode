 "text": "Alexander Gorsky (6 August 1871–1924) was a Russian ballet choreographer and a contemporary of Marius Petipa. He is known for restaging Petipa’s classical ballets such as Swan Lake, Don Quixote, and The Nutcracker. Gorsky \"sought greater naturalism, realism, and characterization\" in ballet.Minden, Eliza Gaynor. The Ballet Companion. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2005. p. 225 He valued acting skills over bravura technique (a showy display of skills such as many turns or high jumps.) His interpretations of ballets were often controversial and he often used artists outside the dance world to create sets and costumes. Gorsky gave continuity to the plots of Petipa’s ballets and removed excessive choreography that did not relate to the story. == Notes == Category:Russian choreographers Category:1871 births Category:1924 deaths",
