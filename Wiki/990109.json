 "text": "Belk Hudson Lofts (also known as Fowler's Department Store or the Lowe-Kilgore Building) is an apartment building in Huntsville, Alabama. Originally theere were two buildings. The first was built on the corner of Washington Street and Holmes Avenue in 1930, and had Fowler's Department Store inside. The second building, next to the first along Holmes Avenue, was built in 1936 as a farm supply store. Fowler's Department Store went bankrupt in 1938, and Belk Husdon purchased the corner building in 1940. Beginning in 1944, they also leased the Holmes building, and the two were joined. After Belk Husdon left the downtown Huntsville area, the building was changed into offices in the 1980s. The Holme's building was destroyed by fire in 2007. It was later rebuilt as a loft apartment building. The original face of the building survived the fire. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. ==References== Category:Huntsville, Alabama Category:Buildings and structures in Alabama",
