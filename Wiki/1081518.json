It is usually performed in pairs and a variety of songs are used with clapping. == Dancing style == Kikkli is more of a sport than a dance for young girls. Two girls stands face to face close to each other and hold their hands crossing arms with their bodies inclined back; in this position their arms are stretched to the maximum and hands interlock firmly. Then they wheel round fast continuously with their dupattas floating in the air and anklets making tinkling sound. The other ladies encourages them to go faster and faster by singing songs with clapping. Sometimes it is done by four girls. The folk song related to the dance has much variety. == References == Category:Punjab Category:Folk dances of Pakistan",
