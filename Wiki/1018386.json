 "text": "Hednesford (said ) is a market town in Staffordshire, United Kingdom. About 17,000 people live in the town, and 100,000 people live in the district that Hednesford is in. The town is north of Birmingham. It is also northwest of London. ==History== The first mention of Hednesford was in 1153, when the town was called Hedenedford. King Stephen decided to not make the people in the hamlet have to pay a tax called a due. His choice meant that people in the hamlet no longer had to pay to let their pigs eat in the forest. The town can be seen on a 1775 map of Staffordshire. The map was created by William Yates. On the map, Hednesford is called Hedgford. It had 13 buildings. Hednesford got bigger because of coal mining in the 19th century. A coal mine called the Uxbridge Pit opened. ==References== Category:Towns in Staffordshire Category:Civil parishes in Staffordshire",
