 "text": "The Keystone Pipeline System is an oil pipeline system in Canada and the United States. It was created in 2010 and owned by TC Energy and, as of March 2020, the Government of Alberta. It runs from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta to refineries in Illinois and Texas. The pipeline has been controversial with many protests from environmentalists happening near the construction site. In 2015, KXL was temporarily delayed by President Barack Obama. On January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered for the pipeline's construction to start again. On January 20, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to end the permit to continue its construction. On June 9, 2021, TC Energy ended plans for the Keystone XL Pipeline. ==References== Category:Pipelines Category:Petroleum Category:Transport in Canada Category:Energy in the United States Category:Transport in the United States",
