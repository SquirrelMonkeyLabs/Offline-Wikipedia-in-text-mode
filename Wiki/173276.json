They wanted to continue the government of the Second Spanish Republic. They hoped that democracy would come back to Spain after World War II, but Franco continued to rule for another 30 years. After Franco's death in 1975, King Juan Carlos restored democratic government. In 1977 the exiled Republicans decided to accept Juan Carlos as king. The king let the exiled politicians come back to Spain. Category:Governments in exile",
