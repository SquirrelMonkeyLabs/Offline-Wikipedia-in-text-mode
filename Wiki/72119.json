 "text": "Floyd Landis (born October 14, 1975) is an American road racing cyclist, now best remembered because of the Tour de France 2006 doping scandal. He is a time-trial specialist and a strong climber. Landis turned professional in 1999 with the Mercury Cycling Team. He joined the US Postal Service team in 2002, and moved to the Phonak Hearing Systems team in 2005. == Doping == Landis was fired from the Phonak team on 5 August 2006. The doping test after stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France showed he had a very high testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The rules say that for every one unit of one chemical he should have four unites of the other (a 4 to one (4:1) ratio). Landis's test showed a ratio of 11:1. Landis appealed to the USA Cycling and saying the tests were not done properly. USA Cycling asked three people from the United States Anti- Doping Agency (USADA) to study Landis's claims. On 20 September 2007, that group voted 2 to 1 against him. Landis was stripped of his title as winner of the 2006 Tour de France by the UCI, and banned from professional racing for two years.

Under UCI rules, the cyclist's national federation, in this case USA Cycling decides if the rules have been broken, but because of the science involved they asked the United States Anti- Doping Agency (USADA) to help. == Biography == Floyd Landis was born in Farmersville, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.Everson, Darren (2006, July 30). World Descends on Farmersville. New York Daily News, p. 62-63. Landis was brought up a Mennonite, and rode his first races wearing sweatpants because his religion forbade wearing shorts; he won anyway.

He had no time to train during the day, so he would sneak out of the house at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. His father, found that Floyd had been going out at night and often followed him at a distance to make sure he was not getting into trouble. Today, Floyd Landis's father is a supporter of his son and says he is one of Floyd's biggest fans.OLN Television broadcast of the 2006 Tour de France, July 22, 2006 === 2006 Tour de France === Before the 2006 Tour de Francemost people thought the winner would be either Ivan Basso or Jan Ullrich, who finished second and third respectively in the 2005 tour. Days before the race, the Operación Puerto doping case forced Basso and Ullrich to withdraw, and Landis became one of the favourites to win === Hip ailment === Landis performance up to Stage 16 of the Tour de France and his comeback in Stage 17 is surprising because of his hip ailment, called osteonecrosis, which was revealed in an article in The New York Times during the 2006 Tour de France.\"What He's Been Pedaling\", The New York Times, July 16, 2006. This means he was in constant pain.\"Landis's Hip Will Need Surgery After Bid for Tour\", The New York Times, July 10, 2006. ===Doping investigation=== On July 27, 2006, the Phonak Cycling Team said Floyd Landis had a urine test come back positive, having an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone (T/E ratio) after Stage 17. Landis denied having doped. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician later disclosed that the test had found a T/E ratio of 11:1 in Landis, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1. The tests were done by French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD)which is part of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life, and is and is accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).) ==== Appeal ==== On May 14, 2007, a meeting began between the USADA and Landis about the doping allegations. On September 20, 2007, the arbitrators found Landis guilty of doping. As Landis forfeited his Tour title, the second place rider, Óscar Pereiro, became the race's official winner. Landis has also been banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007. Landis's former team, Phonak has already been disbanded The USADA had more B samples taken during the Tour de France 2006 examined. After Landis's attempts to prevent these tests had failed, traces of exogenous testosterone were found in several samples in a test of seven samples. These confirmation tests were done at the same French lab Landis's team was trying to discredit for the first positive results. Landis did race in France in 2007 so that the appeal could be decided in the United States first. If the raced in France they may start their own investigation because doping is illegal in France. Among Landis's lawyers are José Maria Buxeda of Spain and Howard L. Jacobs of the United States. Buxeda represented Spanish cyclist Roberto Heras when he was suspended for two years after testing positive for doping. Jacobs has also defended athletes accused of doping, such as cyclist Tyler Hamilton and sprinter Tim Montgomery. They are also representing Kazakh cyclist Alexandre Vinokourov who was accused of blood doping, kicked out of the 2007 Tour de France, and fired from his cycling team. === Verdict === On September 20, 2007, Landis was found guilty of doping by a 2-1 vote of the hearing committee. The committee said that there were mistakes testing the sample so they will not say that there was a high amount of the natural chemical testosterone. But the committee did say was proof of artificial testosterone and that Landis does have the right to appeal the decision of the committee to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Landis loses verdict, must forfeit Tour title MSNBC, September 20, 2007 == Major results == ;1999 - Mercury Pro Cycling Team : 2nd overall and 1 stage win – Cascade Classic ;2000 - Mercury Pro Cycling Team : Overall – Tour du Poitou-Charentes ;2001 - Mercury Pro Cycling Team : Boulevard Road Race ;2002 - U.S. Postal Service : 2nd overall – Dauphiné Libéré : 3rd stage, Tirreno-Adriatico : 61st overall – Tour de France ;2003 - U.S. Postal Service : 77th overall – Tour de France ;2004 - U.S. Postal Service : Overall – Volta ao Algarve :: Stage 5 – Volta ao Algarve : Team time trial – Tour de France : Team time trial – Vuelta a España : 23rd overall – Tour de France ;2005 - Phonak Hearing Systems : 3rd overall and Stage 3 win – Tour de Georgia : 9th overall – Tour de France ;2006 - Phonak Hearing Systems : 1st, Profronde van Stiphout :: Disqualified - Tour de France :: Yellow jersey, General Classification leader during Stages 12, 13, 16 and 20. :: 1st, Stage 17 (voted most combatative rider of the day) : 1st, USA Cycling National Racing Calendar series : 1st overall – Tour de Georgia :: 1st, Stage 3 (ITT) – Tour de Georgia : 1st overall – Paris-Nice : 1st overall – Tour of California :: 1st, Stage 3 (ITT) – Tour of California == References == == Other websites == * Floyd Landis' Website * Sex, drugs and sports: Prostaglandins, epitestosterone and sexual development * Floyd Landis profile * Trust But Verify: News, Research and Commentary about the Floyd Landis doping allegations.
