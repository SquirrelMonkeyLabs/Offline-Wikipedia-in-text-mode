Congress disbanded it and sold the ships in 1785. It was started again as the Department of the Navy on April 30, 1798. The Department of the Navy needed places to make ships, which are called shipyards, in various port cities. Where slaves were available, it paid slaveowners to rent their slaves. Shipyards with slaves included ones in Washington, D.C., Norfolk, Virginia, and Pensacola, Florida. == Sailors == Today, the US Navy has over 300,000 sailors and officers, and almost another 100,000 workers who are not official sailors. == Strength == The US Navy has about 300 warships, or ships designed for fighting. The largest warships are aircraft carriers, which have large and flat decks that act as small airports for planes carrying weapons.
