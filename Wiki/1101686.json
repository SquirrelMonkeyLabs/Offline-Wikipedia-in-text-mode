 "text": "The Vietnamese bubble-nest frog or Annamite jelly-nest tree frog (Feihyla palpebralis) is a frog. It lives in Vietnam in the Langbian Peaks. Scientists think it might live in Laos or China too. People see this frog near swampy streams on mountains between 700 and 2000 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs on plants over the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the pond. She lays about 52 eggs at a time. Scientists believe this frog is not in much danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. However, human beings have cut down the trees in the forests where it lives to build farms, especially for things to sell for example coffee , rubber, and tea. Two of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve and Kon Ka Kinh National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
