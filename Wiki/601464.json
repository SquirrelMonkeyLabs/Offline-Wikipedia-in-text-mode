 "text": "The Panama Papers are 11.5 million leaked documents that talked about financial and attorneyâ€“client information for more than 214,488 offshore tax accounts. The documents, some traced back to the 1970s, were created by, and taken from, Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca, and were leaked in 2015 by an anonymous source to German journalist Bastian Obermayer. The documents contain personal financial information about wealthy individuals and public officials that had been kept private. While offshore business tax activities are legal, reporters found that some of the Mossack Fonseca shell corporations were used for illegal purposes, including fraud, tax evasion, and evading international sanctions. ==Related pages== * Paradise Papers *Pandora Papers ==References== Category:21st century in Panama Category:2016 in North America",
