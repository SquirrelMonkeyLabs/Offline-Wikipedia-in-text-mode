It was highly critical during the Cristina Fernández de Kirchner presidency. In 2013, it won several Martin Fierro Awards including best news TV program and best journalistic work for Jorge Lanata. ==Description== The TV program opens with a \"humorous\" stand-up comedy, where Lanata comments on the political events of the week with jokes. These stand- ups are included as an homage to the late Tato Bores, who made similar monologues in his TV programs, which were also aired on Sunday nights.Plagios, homenajes e \"inspiraciones\" de la TV argentina The stand-ups feature a parody of the president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, made by the humorist Fátima Florez. The high success of the parody made by Florez was pointed by the magazine Noticias, which placed her on the main page.Cristina, cada vez más parecida a su imitadora The theme song is \"Fuck You\", by Lily Allen. It was chosen to redress it after it was used in a telenovela of the state-owned TV Pública, in a poor Spanish translation. The opening features photos of the audience making the middle finger, which soon became the icon of the program.El “¡Fuck You!” de Lanata The program was redesigned in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. The program did away with the live audience and the big setting, and featured just Lanata alone in a desk. The program was now called \"PPT Box\", and the intro and outro secuences make the visual effect of Lanata being inside a giant box. ==References== Category:Journalism Category:Television programs Category:2012 television series debuts Category:2023 television series endings",
