 "text": "The Shillong bubble-nest frog, Xmas bush frog, or Shillong bush frog (Raorchestes shillongensis) is a frog. It lives in India. This frog sits on shrubs in forests. It can also live near streams and even in towns. People have seen this frog in the Khasi Hills between 1000 and 1600 meters above sea level. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, it hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that people have changed. However, it is at some risk. Humans cut down trees to get wood to build with and to build. Scientists think climate change could hurt this frog. Because it lives high in the hills, it cannot move north if its home becomes too warm. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
