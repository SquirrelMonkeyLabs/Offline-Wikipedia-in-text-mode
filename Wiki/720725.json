 "text": "Dixy Lee Ray (September 3, 1914 – January 2, 1994) was an American scientist and politician. She was the 17th Governor of the U.S. state of Washington. She was the state's first female governor and was in office during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. She was defeated in the Democratic primary in 1980 by Jim McDermott, who in turn lost the gubernatorial election to John Spellman. Ray was born Marguerite Ray in Tacoma, Washington, to Frances Adams Ray and Alvis Marion Ray, the second in a family of five girls. She joined the Girl Scouts and, at the age of 12, became the youngest girl, up to that time, to summit Mount Rainier. In 1930, at age 16, she legally changed her name to \"Dixy Lee\". She chose \"Lee\" because of a family connection to Robert E. Lee. In 1973, Ray was appointed chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) by President Richard Nixon. Under her leadership, research and development were separated from safety programs. She was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs by President Gerald Ford in 1975, but resigned six months later, complaining about lack of input into department decision making. Dixy Lee Ray died on January 2, 1994, at her home in Fox Island, Washington from pneumonia, aged 79. After her death, it was reported that employees of the Pierce County medical examiner's office had kept autopsy photos of Ray as souvenirs. ==References== ==Other websites== * Register of the Dixy Lee Ray Papers, 1937–1982 * Category:1914 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Governors of Washington (state) Category:Scientists from Washington (state) Category:Politicians from Tacoma, Washington Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians Category:Mills College alumni Category:Deaths from pneumonia",
