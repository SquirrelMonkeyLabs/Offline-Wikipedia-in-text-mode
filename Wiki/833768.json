 "text": "A catgirl (猫娘, nekomusume) is a female anthropomorphic character with cat traits. Catgirls are often found in various fiction genres and in particular Japanese anime and manga. Catboys are the male counterparts to catgirls. Some catgirls or catboys can be seen wearing a french maid outfit. In late 2020, catboys gained more recognition as femboys became popularized by the app TikTok, with many of the femboys on the app donning feline accessories due to popular memes that encouraged them to \"put on the cat ears\" or promoted catboys in general. ==References== Category:Anime and manga terms",
