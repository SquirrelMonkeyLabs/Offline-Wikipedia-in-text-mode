 "text": "A suffragan bishop is a type of bishop in some Christian denominations. In the Catholic Church, a suffragan bishop leads a diocese that is part of a church province, which it is not the main diocese (usually led by the metropolitan archbishop). A diocese led by a suffragan bishop is called a suffragan diocese. In the Anglican Church, a suffragan bishop is under a metropolitan bishop or a diocesan bishop (the main bishop of a diocese). They usually do not have full power but may take care of a suffragan diocese or areas without a cathedral. == Related pages == * Archbishop * Archbishop ad personam * Cardinal (Catholic Church) * Bishop coadjutor * Bishop-elect == References == Category:Bishops by type",
