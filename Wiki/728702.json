 "text": "Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game (usually just called Fallout 2) was a video game released in 1998. It was made by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay. It was a sequel to Fallout, and the second game in the Fallout series. It had very similar graphics and gameplay to the first Fallout, but a larger world and longer story. The sequel to Fallout 2 was not made by Black Isle Studios because Bethesda Softworks bought the Fallout series. Eventually Bethesda Game Studios made Fallout 3 in 2008. ==References== Category:1998 video games Category:Fallout Category:LGBT- related video games Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games",
