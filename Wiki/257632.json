The Twinkie was originally filled with banana cream inside but switched to a vanilla cream taste during the Second World War when bananas were rationed. Twinkies have around 150 calories (627.6 kJ) in each bar. Twinkies have a cookbook and it has over 60 recipes. They can also be deep-fried, like the deep-fried Mars bar. Twinkies also have a mascot called Twinkie the Kid which is an anthropomorphized Twinkie. ==References== Category:Snack foods",
