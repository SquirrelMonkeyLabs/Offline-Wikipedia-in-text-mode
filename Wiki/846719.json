 "text": "Sex in movies is about human sexuality in movies. Any form of sexuality being present in movies has been controversial since the development of movies. Some movies having sexuality have been criticized by religious groups. Some have been banned or censored by the governments of certain countries. In countries with film rating systems, movies having explicit sex often get a restricted rating. For example, in the United States, many movies with explicit sex are given NC-17 ratings by the Motion Picture Association of America. Examples of such movies are Blue Is the Warmest Colour (2013), Showgirls (1995), Belle de Jour (1967), In the Realm of the Senses (1976), Last Tango in Paris (1972), Crash and When Night Is Falling (1995). Erotic movies are usually movies having an erotic quality that may create sexual themes or feelings. Sexual scenes, themes or materials are found in a wide range of genres or sub-genres. Some genres that have sexual or erotic components include the term erotic in their descriptions. These include erotic dramas, erotic thrillers, sex comedies and romantic dramas. ==References== Category:Works about sexuality Category:Movies",
