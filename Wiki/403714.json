 "text": "Super Mario 3D World is a 2013 platform video game released for the Wii U. It is part of the Mario series. It is the sequel to the 2011 Nintendo 3DS game Super Mario 3D Land. It was released in Japan on November 21, 2013, in North America on November 22, 2013, in Europe on November 29, 2013, and in Australia on November 30, 2013. A Nintendo Switch remaster, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, was announced during a Super Mario Bros. 35th Anniversary themed Nintendo Direct and was released worldwide on February 12, 2021. ==Gameplay== Players control Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad. Like in Super Mario Bros. 2, each character has its own unique abilities. Luigi can jump higher than other characters, Princess Peach can float in midair for a short time, and Toad can run fast. Rosalina also appears as a fifth playable character, who needs to be unlocked in order to play as her. She can use the spin attack move that is seen in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, but is the slowest character. There is a new item called the Super Bell that turns the player into their cat form, which allows players to climb up walls, run faster, perform unique attacks, and run up to the top of the goal pole at the end of each level. The game features a multiplayer mode. ==References== Category:2013 video games Category:2021 video games Category:Mario platform games Category:3D platformers Category:Cooperative video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development games Category:Nintendo Network games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Wii U games",
