He was born in Ballarat, Victoria. He was ordained in 1966. He was made cardinal by Pope John Paul II. He served as the eighth Archbishop of Sydney (2001–2014), Archbishop of Melbourne (1996–2001), and Auxiliary Bishop of Melbourne (1987–1996). He was created a cardinal in 2003. On 29 June 2017, Pell was charged in Victoria, Australia, with multiple historical sexual assault offences, and denied all charges. Pope Francis granted him leave to return to Australia to defend himself. Pell was committed to stand trial on the lesser charges, pleading not guilty. On 7 April 2020, the High Court of Australia found Pell not guilty from his convictions and issued verdicts of acquittal. The Court's said that there was \"a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted because the evidence did not establish guilt\". On 10 January 2023, Pell died due to cardiac arrest after having hip replacement surgery in Rome. He was 81. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1941 births Category:2023 deaths Category:Australian Roman Catholic bishops Category:Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church Category:People acquitted of sex crimes Category:People from Ballarat Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals",
