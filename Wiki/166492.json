 "text": "The ideal gas law is the equation of a possible ideal gas, first made by Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron in 1834. The state or amount of an amount of gas is found by using its pressure, volume, and temperature in the equation: :\\ pV = nRT where :\\ p is the absolute pressure of the gas, :\\ V is the volume of the gas, :\\ n is the number of moles of gas, :\\ R is the universal gas constant, :\\ T is the absolute temperature. == Other websites == * Ideal gas law -Citizendium Category:Thermodynamics Category:Physical chemistry Category:Laws of physics",
