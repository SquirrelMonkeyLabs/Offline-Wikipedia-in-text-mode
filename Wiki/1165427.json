The skin of the frog's back has dark colors on it, with three marks that can be shaped like triangles or diamonds. Most frogs have a stripe down each side of the body. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in forests. Scientists saw the frog 132 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in some protected places, for example Parque Nacional da Amazonia, Reserva Extrativista Tapajós-Arapiuns, and Floresta Nacional do Tapajós. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs in a jelly nest that she puts on a rolled- up leaf. The rain falls onto the nest and turns the jelly to liquid. The tadpoles swim and grow in the rainwater. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
