 "text": "The Crurotarsi are one of the two main groups of archosaurs. It includes the archosaurs (living today are crocodiles and birds). It also includes all their ancestors and relatives right back to the early Triassic period, including the Pseudosuchia.Sereno, Paul 1991. Basal archosaurs: phylogenetic relationships and functional implications. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 11 (Suppl. 4): 1–51. Crurotarsi: * Avemetatarsalia ** †Pterosauria ** †Dinosauria *** Aves (birds) * The crocodile line Pseudosuchia ** †Phytosauria: semi-aquatic long- snouted types ** †Aetosauria: quadrupedal armoured herbivores ** †Ornithosuchidae: look rather like dinosaurs ** Crocodylomorpha (Crocodilia and their ancestors) ** †Rauisuchia ? uncertain group, includes some large- bodied quadrupedal predators Both main groups of Archosaurs are defined by features of their ankle joints.Sereno P.C. & Arcucci A.B. 1990.
