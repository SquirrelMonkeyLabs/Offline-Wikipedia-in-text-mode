 "text": "Maurice Garin (March 3, 1871 - February 19, 1957) was a road bicycle racer. He is best known for winning the 1903 Tour de France - the very first running of the race. Garin was born in Arvier in the Aosta Valley in north-west Italy. He became a naturalized French citizen only in December 1901, when he was already a champion cyclist, winner of the second Paris-Roubaix. He was declared the winner of the 1904 Tour de France, but was later disqualified. The Tour de France organisation and the French cycling authorities have not said why. They were said to have taken a train through part of the route. In the early days stages were much longer than today, sometimes starting in the dark. When he retired from professional cycling he ran a small garage in Lens until his death. He is buried in the Cimeti√®re Est in the neighbouring suburb of Sallaumines == Major Wins == ;1897 :Paris-Roubaix ;1898 :Paris-Roubaix ;1902 :Bordeaux-Paris ;1903 :Tour de France ::Winner overall classification ::Winner 3 stages ==Other websites== *http://www.lepays.net/jdj/01/02/20/MA/article_1.html Category:1871 births Category:1957 deaths Category:French cyclists Category:Italian cyclists Category:Tour de France winners Category:People from Aosta Valley",
