 "text": "The pleasing poison frog (Ameerega bassleri) is a frog. It lives in Peru. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams in forests. Scientists saw the frog between 247 and 1097 meters above sea level. It stays close to streams closer to sea level and can go further away higher up. This frog can live in some places that people have changed. Some of the places the frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul and Parque Nacional Cordillera Esclera. Scientists think it could also live in Bosque de Protecci√≥n Alto Mayo. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water, for example ditches next to roads or pools near streams where the water does not move. He almost never takes tadpoles to water that moves. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Humans change the places where the frog lives. People cut down forests to make places to grow palm plants for oil and to make places for cows to eat grass. Scientists say that the international pet trade probably will not make this frog die out. This is because it is legal for humans to raise the frogs to sell. But scientists think that if people go into the forest to catch some frogs, for example the green color morph, then those frogs could disappear from the wild. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
