 "text": "The term childfree means people who choose not to have children. It includes people who have had sterilisation (surgery such as a vasectomy) to make themselves unable to have children. The most common reasons for being childfree are: *not liking children *asceticism or religious reasons *not wanting to become a parent *thinking that wanting to reproduce oneself is narcissistic *not having enough money to take care of children *personal well- being People may also choose not to have children for ethical reasons, such as antinatalism. By choosing not to have their own children, childfree people have choices of saving large amounts of money. They can also focus on themselves. They usually benefit society more by being childless rather than having children. Research has found no significant evidence that older child- free adults experience more life regret than older parents, challenging the stereotype that child-free individuals might be less satisfied with their life choices compared to their counterparts with children. Being childless was considered unusual in the 1950s. Since then, the number of adults without children has increased. Many researchers say childfree adults are more educated, less likely to be religious and more likely to live around cities. In the late 2000s to early 2010s, the rate of women in the United States becoming pregnant dropped almost 9%. The birth rate between 2010 and 2013 was the lowest in the country's history. ==Related pages== * Antinatalism * Abortion * Birth control * Childlessness * Sterilization ==References== Category:Relationships Category:Family Category:Children Category:Antinatalism",
