 "text": "The tiger-striped leaf frog or tiger-striped monkey frog (Calllimedusa tomopterna) is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Guyana, Brazil, Venezuela, French Guiana, and Ecuador, and it is most common in Suriname. Scientists have seen it up in the mountains, between 280 and 1000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is to long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is long. It is green with orange color on its sides and legs. The irises of its eyes are silver or gray. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. When it is time to lay eggs, the adult frog builds a nest out of leaves on a branch hanging over the water. She puts 70 clear eggs at a time in the leaf nest. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water. Scientists do not believe this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
