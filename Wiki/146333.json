 "text": "An emirate is a political territory that is ruled by an emir, a dynastic Arab Monarch. The word emirate or amirate comes from , Imaarah ; plural: إمارات, Imaraat. The United Arab Emirates is a federal state of seven federal emirates, each administered by a hereditary emir, these seven elect the federation's President and Prime Minister. Most emirates have either disappeared or become part of a larger modern state, some changed their rulers' title, e.g. to Malik (Arabic for King) or Sultan. Therefore true emirate-states have become rare. In Arabic the term can be generalized to mean any province of a country that is administered by a member of the ruling class, especially of a member of the royal family, as in Saudi Arabian governorates.Stig Stenslie, Regime Stability in Saudi Arabia: The Challenge of Succession (London; New York: Routledge, 2012), p. 33 == List of independent Emirates == * Kuwait * Qatar * United Arab Emirates == List of former and integrated emirates == * The Emirate of Armenia * Emirate of Sicily, Sicily 965-1072 * Emirate of Granada, Spain 1228-1492 * Emirate of Trarza, modern southwest Mauritania 1640s-1910s * Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan * Islamic Emirate of Waziristan * Az Zubayr * Bahrain, became a kingdom in 2002 == References == == Other websites == * What Is Life Really Like In Dubai, UAE?; YouTube Category:Feudalism Category:Forms of government",
