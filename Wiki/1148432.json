 "text": "The confusing rocket frog or confounding rocket frog (Ectopoglossus confusus) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== Scientists found one male frog. It was 21.7 mm long from nose to rear end and six female frogs were 23 - 26 mm long. The skin of the frog's back can look black or can look dark green, depending on the light. It has light brown or bronze spots. There are stripes across the legs. There is some blue color on the front legs. The throat and belly are light blue in color. The iris of the eye is light bronze or green in color with a black pattern. The bottoms of the legs are gray-brown in color with some orange. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams with clear water and rocks on hte bottom. It lives on mountains where 2000-4000 mm of rain falls each year. Scientists saw the frog between 600 and 1700 meters above sea level. The frog lives in one protected park: Reserva Ecol√≥gica Los Ilinizas. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Humans have cut down forests so that only small pieces of forest are left, and the frogs cannot move between those pieces easily. Humans also cut down forests to get wood to build with, to make places for cows to eat grass, and to make farms. Scientists have seen the fungal disease chytridiomycosis near where the frog lives, but they are not sure if it has killed many of this frog or not. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
