It does not have much webbing on its front feet. The skin of its back is bright green, but it can change color to brown during the day. Its belly is almost white. There is a green stripe down each side of its back legs. It sometimes has orange and black stripes on its legs too. This frog is in danger because human beings change the places it lives into soybean farms and sugar cane farms and by building dams. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
