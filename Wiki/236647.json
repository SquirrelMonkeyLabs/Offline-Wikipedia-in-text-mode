 "text": "John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough KG PC (26 May 1650 – 16 June 1722) was an important English soldier and statesman who lived in the rules of five monarchs in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Rising from a lowly page at the court of the House of Stuart, he faithfully served James, Duke of York in the 1670s and the early 1680s. That gave him military and political advancement through his brave and clever skill. Churchill helped secure the Duke of York, now King James II, on the throne. However, just three years later he left the Catholic king for a Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. For Churchill's help during in the Glorious Revolution, William at his coronation made him Earl of Marlborough (pronounced /'mɔ:l bəɹə/). Marlborough served during the early years of the Nine Years' War and became famous. However, charges of Jacobitism made him fall from office. For some time, he was imprisoned in the Tower. When Queen Anne came to throne in 1702, however, Marlborough secured his fame and lots of money. His marriage to the irritable Sarah Jennings, Anne's close friend, helped Marlborough's rise. Marlborough first became the Captain-Generalcy of British forces and then became a duke. Later, he became the richest of Anne's subjects. In the end, he could not completely crush his enemies, but his victories allowed Britain to rise to very great power. Through him, Great Britain became richer and richer in the 18th century. ==Titles== Title Years Followed by Duke of Marlborough 1702–1722 Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough Earl of Marlborough 1689–1722 Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough Baron Churchill of Sandridge 1685–1722 Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough Lord Churchill of Eyemouth 1682–1722 extinct Prince of Mindelheim 1705–1714 Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria == Titles and styles == *26 May 1650 - 21 December 1682: John Churchill, Esq. * 21 December 1682 – 14 May 1685: The Right Honourable The Lord Churchill of Eyemouth *14 May 1685 – 9 April 1689: The Right Honourable The Lord Churchill of Sandridge and Eyemouth * 9 April 1689 – December 1702: The Right Honourable The Earl of Marlborough * December 1702 – 16 June 1722: His Grace The Duke of Marlborough ** in the Holy Roman Empire: 18 November 1705 – ??? 1714: His Serene Highness The Prince of Mindelheim ** in the Holy Roman Empire: ??? 1714 – 16 June 1722: His Serene Highness The Prince of Mellenburg ==References== *Barnett, Correlli (1999).
