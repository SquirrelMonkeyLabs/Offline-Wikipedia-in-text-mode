 "text": "Drug withdrawal is the group of symptoms that occur upon the fast discontinuation or decrease in intake of medications or recreational drugs. In order to experience the symptoms of withdrawal, one must have first developed a form of drug addiction, which may occur as physical dependence, psychological dependence, or both. Symptoms can also occur when people stop taking drugs whicch they had taken for a long time. That way, if someone switches from one drug to another one (for example to reduce side effects), this change needs to be planned carefully with the aid of a physician. ==References== Category:Drugs Category:Addiction",
