 "text": "ECAC Lacrosse, in full the ECAC Lacrosse League, was an American college sports conference that only played men's lacrosse. The conference, a member of NCAA Division I, was founded in 1999 with play beginning in 2000 (both events were in the same school year). The conference started with six members, and grew to as many as 10 schools. In its final years, it went through many membership changes; the biggest ones were: * The original Big East Conference added the sport for the 2010 season, leading three members to leave. * At the same time, two other members left for the Colonial Athletic Association. * The Great Western Lacrosse League collapsed after the 2009 season, with five of that league's six final schools joining ECAC Lacrosse. ECAC Lacrosse disbanded after the 2014 season. This came after the Big Ten Conference, home to two of the final five members, said it would start a men's lacrosse league in the 2015 season. Two of the other three final members soon announced moves to other conferences. ==Members== ===Final members=== These schools were members in the league's last season of 2014. Because NCAA lacrosse is a spring sport, the year of joining is the calendar year before the first season of play.
