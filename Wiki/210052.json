 "text": "The Port of Manchester is in the north west of England. It was created as a customs port on 1 January 1894. This was four months before the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal transformed Manchester from a landlocked city into a major sea port. It extended along the whole 36 miles length of the canal, from Eastham in the west to Manchester in the east, absorbing the Port of Runcorn, which had been created in 1862. The creation of the new port moved the Port of Liverpool's boundary 11 milles to the west. Once delivered to the port, goods travelled as far west as Warrington, about 20 miles north, as far east as Leeds, and up to 100 miles south to Birmingham. ==References== Category:Geography of Greater Manchester",
