 "text": "The National Railway Company of Belgium ) is the national railway company of Belgium. The company uses the Dutch and French abbreviations NMBS/SNCB. The corporate logo designed in 1936 by Henry van de Velde consists of the linguistically neutral letter B in a horizontal oval. NMBS/SNCB is a government company, formed in 1926 as successor to the Belgian State Railways. In 2005, the company was split up into three parts: Infrabel, which manages the railway infrastructure, network operations, and network access, the public railway operator NMBS/SNCB itself to manage the freight (B-Cargo) and passenger services, and NMBS/SNCB-Holding, which owns both public companies and supervises the collaboration between them. This was to facilitate future liberalisation of railway freight and passenger services in agreement with European regulations. Several freight operators can now use the Belgian network. In February 2011, NMBS/SNCB Logistics began operating as a separate business. ==References== Category:1926 establishments in Europe Category:1920s establishments in Belgium Category:Rail transport in Belgium Category:Railway companies Category:Companies of Belgium",
