 "text": "The .357 Magnum cartridge is a pistol cartridge. It has a high stopping power and enough penetration power to shoot through many kinds of body armor. It was based on the .38 Special. Revolvers that shoot the .357 Magnum can also shoot the .38 Special. It was first made to stop criminals wearing body armor and hiding in cars. It was the fastest handgun cartridge made until the .44 Magnum. It is popular for hunting and self-defense. Most guns that shoot the .357 Magnum are revolvers or lever-action rifles, but there are also some semi-automatic pistols that can shoot .357 Magnums, such as the Desert Eagle. ==References== Category:Firearms Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges",
