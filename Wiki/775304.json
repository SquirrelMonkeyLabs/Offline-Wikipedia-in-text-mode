 "text": "Revenge porn is the act of getting revenge on somebody by way of pornography. It usually means spreading sexually explicit pictures or videos of a person without their permission. The possession of the material may be used by the partners to punish or embarrass the victim. Several areas have passed laws against revenge porn. They include Israel, Iran, Algeria, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most of the United States. In the 1980s, the Hustler magazine began a monthly show of reader-submitted images of naked women called the \"Beaver Hunt\". The Beaver Hunt photos usually came with details about these women, such as their names and their hobbies. Some of the women sued the magazine for publishing their photos without their permission. In 2010, Hunter Moore launched a website called IsAnyoneUp. The website was similar to the Beaver Hunt. The first person who spoke against Moore was activist Charlotte Laws. She was also one of the first people to publicly support revenge pornography victims. In June 2015 Google decided they would remove links to revenge porn on request. Microsoft did the same in July.
