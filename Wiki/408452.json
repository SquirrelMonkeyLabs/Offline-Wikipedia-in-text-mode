He then left for Asia on 5 May 1601, commanding the company of the Moucheron (a trading company before the establishment of the Dutch East India Company). His ships were the Ram, Schaap and Lam. Spilbergen met the king of Kandy (Sri Lanka) Vimala Dharma Suriya in 1602, and talked about the trading of cinnamon. In 1607, Spilbergen traveled on Aeolus. He was with Jacob van Heemskerk at the Battle of Gibraltar. In 1614, he sailed beyond the Strait of Magellan and invaded the Spanish settlements on the coast of California.
