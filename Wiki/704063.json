 "text": "Big League Chew is an American brand of bubble gum. It is cut up and packaged in an aluminum foil pouch as a fun imitation of the tobacco-chewing often used by baseball players. It was created by Portland Mavericks left-handed pitcher Rob Nelson and bat boy Todd Field. The Wrigley Company, which makes many other types of chewing gum, bought the idea from Rob Nelson and Jim Bouton. Big League Chew was first sold in May 1980. Over 800 million pouches of Big League Chew have been sold. It comes in bright colors such as neon green for their sour apple flavor and bright purple for their grape flavor. ==References== Category:1980 establishments in the United States Category:Candy Category:Baseball",
