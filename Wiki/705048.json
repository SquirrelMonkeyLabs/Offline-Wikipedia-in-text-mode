 "text": "Hakuna matata means \"no worries\" in Swahili â€“ a language of East Africa. The phrase was used in the Disney movie The Lion King in a song of the same name. ==Usage== In 2003, Disney trademarked the phrase in the US. In 2018, some people accused the Disney or \"colonialism\" and \"robbery\" for stealing the phrase from East Africa. The phrase is popular in Kenya, one of the countries where it came from. However, due to the said trademark, Kenyans are not allowed to sell stuff to the US that use that phrase. == References == Category:The Lion King Category:Phrases Category:The Lion King songs",
