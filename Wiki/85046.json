 "text": "C# (pronounced \"see sharp\") is a computer programming language. It is developed by Microsoft. It was created to use all capacities of the .NET platform. The first version was released in 2001. C# is a modern language in active development, with the most recent version at time of writing being C# 13, which was released in June 2024 alongside .NET 9. C#'s development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of Delphi. == Execution Platform == *The Microsoft .NET platform; *Free implementation of C# and .NET like Mono developed by Novell, or dotGNU developed by the Free Software Foundation. Today, C# can be run on most platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) without changing the source code. C# can be run on the Xbox 360 platform with a special framework. == Syntax == C# code is similar to C++ and Java code. The CLR (Common Language Runtime) is needed in order to run a C# program. === \"Hello, World!\" example === /* This is a simple program in C#. * It simply shows \"Hello, World!\" on the screen. */ using System; namespace HelloWorld { class Hello { static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\"); // The piece of code below is optional, but is needed to prevent the program from closing immediately. Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\"); Console.ReadKey(); } } } === Basic input example === /* * This program asks for input from the user, i.e. a name. It then prints \"Hello [name]\", replacing [name] with whatever the person typed in. */ using System; namespace HelloWorld { class Hello { static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, please type in your name:\"); string name = Console.ReadLine(); Console.WriteLine(\"Hello {0}\",name); Console.ReadKey(); } } } == Integrated Development Environments == C# can be edited in a number of IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), some of which are listed below: Windows: *Microsoft Visual Studio *SharpDevelop *Visual C# *Visual C# Express *Rider Mac OS X: *MonoDevelop (With limitations) *Microsoft Visual Studio Unix/Linux: *MonoDevelop == Sources == ==Related pages== * Object-oriented programming * C (programming language) * C++ * Java == Other websites == * C#.NET in Hindi - सीखें आसानी से। * C# Station, Example, Video * Visual C# Developer Center * C# lessons *c# continue at CodeExampler for Free * C# Station * Visual C# * Introduction to the C# Language and the .NET Framework * C# / CSharp Tutorial * Visual C# Tutorials and Lessons (Learn C#) * Visual C# .NET Programming on http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/ * Examples for C# Essentials *Learn C# with Examples (C# Tutorial) *C# Programming Examples Category:Object-oriented programming languages",
