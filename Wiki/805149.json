 "text": "\"Pizzagate\" is a debunked conspiracy theory that went viral during the 2016 United States presidential election cycle mainly supported by far-right politicians and activists. In March 2016, the personal email account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, was hacked in a spear-phishing attack. Supporters of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory falsely claimed the emails had coded messages that connected several high-ranking Democratic Party officials and U.S. restaurants with an alleged human trafficking and child sex ring. ==References== Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Hillary Rodham Clinton",
