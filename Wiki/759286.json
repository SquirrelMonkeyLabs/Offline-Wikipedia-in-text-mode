Somali Prime Minister, Hassan Ali Khaire announced that the government had set aside five million dollars to deal with the disease. The Somali Medical Association was worried that the death toll in the country will be huge and that Somalia will not be able to recover from the economic effects due to poor working relations and the lack of healthcare. It was also rumored that President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed may use the pandemic as an excuse to postpone elections. There were concerns over freedom of the press following arrests of journalists who were covering the pandemic in Somalia. ==References== Category:21st century in Somalia Somalia",
