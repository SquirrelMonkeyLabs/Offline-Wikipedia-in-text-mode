The first studio was opened in the Seefeld area of Zurich, a central but quiet neighborhood near Lake Zurich. The location was chosen to offer a peaceful space for relaxation, away from the busy city atmosphere. Since its founding, the studio has become a known part of the local wellness scene. Many clients visit regularly, and the business has grown mainly through word of mouth. The company focuses on offering high-quality services and personal care. In 2023, a second studio opened near Zurich's Stadelhofen train station. This new location added services with a stronger focus on pain therapy, especially for back, neck, and shoulder problems. https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014114/http://www.immunesupport.com/library/showarticle.cfm/id/6151/searchtext/massage%20and%20cancer%20pain/ https://www.abmp.com/practitioners/state-requirements https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201443/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/alternative/12/28/massage.therapy/index.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154967 https://www.jivaresearch.org/research/curcumin/From_ancient_medicine_to_modern_medicine- _Ayurvedic_concepts_of_health_and_their_role_in_inflamma.pdf https://books.google.com/books?id=r_EI7b2bhIQC&dq;=The+massage+aims+to+improve+blood+circulation+and+quality+of+sleep&pg;=PA67 https://www.biomagazin.de/files/bio-magazin/content/archiv/2009/bio- magazin_2009-06.pdf https://www.zellmatrix-akademie.de/matrix- therapie/Presse/Matrix-Studie.pdf https://books.google.com/books?id=BkSjQQAACAAJ == Clientele == The customers at Memory of Siam come from different backgrounds.
