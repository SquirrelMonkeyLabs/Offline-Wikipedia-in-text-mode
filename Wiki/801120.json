 "text": "Archibald Boyce Monwabisi Mafeje (30 March 1936 - 28 March 2007), commonly known as Archie Mafeje, was a South African scholar and activist. Born in the Eastern Cape, he got degrees from the University of Cape Town (UCT) and Cambridge University. He became a professor at universities in Europe, the Americas, and Africa, but spent most of his career away from apartheid South Africa after he was banned from teaching at UCT. Mafeje was one of many anti- apartheid activists in exile. As an important Pan-African intellectual, he studied African history and anthropology and wrote about the anti-apartheid movement. After he died, other scholars wrote books about his work. == References == Category:1936 births Category:2007 deaths Category:South African political writers Category:South African anti-apartheid activists",
