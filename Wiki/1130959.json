 "text": "A paste (known as an empanada or Inglesa in other Latin American countries: Argentina and Guatemala, UK diaspora 1880s) is a small pastry produced in the state of Hidalgo in central Mexico and in the surrounding area. They are stuffed with a variety of fillings including potatoes and ground beef, apples, pineapple, sweetened rice, or other typical Mexican ingredients, such as tinga and mole. The paste has its roots in the Cornish pasty introduced by miners and builders from Cornwall in the United Kingdom, who were contracted in the towns of Mineral del Monte (Real del Monte) and Pachuca in Hidalgo starting in 1824.
