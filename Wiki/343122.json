In the book, Masson accuses Freud of hiding evidence that some patients were sexually abused by their parents. Masson was research director of the Sigmund Freud Archives in New York City. He was removed from the job after saying Freud was responsible for \"the present-day sterility of psychoanalysis throughout the world.\" ==References== Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:American psychologists Category:American historians Category:Writers from Chicago Category:Scientists from Chicago",
