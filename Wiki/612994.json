 "text": "Magnetic levitation, maglev, or magnetic suspension is a method by which an object is suspended with no support other than magnetic fields. Magnetic force is used to counteract the effects of the gravitational acceleration and any other accelerations. The two primary issues involved in magnetic levitation are lifting forces: providing an upward force sufficient to counteract gravity, and stability: ensuring that the system does not spontaneously slide or flip into a configuration where the lift is neutralized. The sizes of magnets also has a role in the levitation. While using smaller magnets it is easier to control levitation and experimental conditions. Magnetic levitation is used for maglev trains, contactless melting, magnetic bearings and for product display purposes. Category:Magnetism Category:Technology",
