Most of his time with Flamengo, he was a key player in the team's defense and he was highly praised for his leadership, marking opponents and a ball-winner and he formed a formidable defensive duo with Bigode which was considered to be one of the best defences ever. In 1951 he signed a contract with the club \"Palmeiras\", in which he spent the next three years of his career as a player. Playing for Palmeiras, he also mostly played for the main team. From 1954 to 1958 he defended the colors of the Bahia club, and ended his professional playing career at the Ipiranga (Bahia) club, for which he played from 1958 to 1960. ==International career== He made his debut on May 17, 1944 against Chile with 2-1 victory for the Brazilian national team.

He was blamed along with Barbosa and Bigode for the defeat and he retired from the Selecão, although his performance led him to be included in the \"Team of the Tournament\". ==Later life and death== In the 1990s, Juvenal was left destitute, his legs were extremely sore due to arthritis in his right knee, which made him unable to walk, and survived only thanks to the help of his neighbors. Juvenal lived in a hut with holes in the roof without a toilet, kitchen or shower. Soon a telecast about the hard life of Juvenal was shown on Bailly's telecast. And after this report, many people responded to help the former football player, many helped with money, someone gave Juvenal a portable radio. He was transferred to a fee-paying clinic in Santo Antonio das Obras, and then began to pay for his trips to das Clínicas in Salvador, where a former football player and now a doctor, Luis Carlos Menezes, helped Juvenal learn to walk again. And in 2009, the government of the state of Bahia gave Juvenal a new house on Jahua street in the city Kamasari, consisting of a living room, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a small courtyard. On October 30, 2009, Juvenal, the last living Brazilian player to take the field in the 1950 World Cup final, died in the Camasari Public Hospital, where he had been sent 15 days earlier.
