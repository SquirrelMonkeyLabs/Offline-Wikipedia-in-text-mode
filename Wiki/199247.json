 "text": "Slipknot is a heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. ==History== The band started in 1995 by vocalist and percussionist clown, guitarists Donnie Steele and Josh \"Gnar\" Brainard, bassist Paul Gray, drummer Joey Jordison,and percussionist Shawn Crahan. Before the band released its first album in 1999, Slipknot has gone through many line-up changes. After their first album, the line-up has stayed the same. The band is known for having a lot of members. The current members include a lead singer, two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, two percussionists, a sampler, and a turntablist. In 1996, when the band finished recording their demo album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat., Slipknot saw its first line-up change when guitarist Donnie Steele left the band and was replaced by Craig Jones. Shortly after, drummer Jordison said they needed a full-time sampler and Jones took the position as \"he liked doing that anyway.\" Mick Thomson then joined the band to be the new guitarist. After Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. was released, the band continued working on new songs which needed more singing melody and the then-lead singer Colsefni had a hard time with this. In 1997, Corey Taylor was asked to join the band and after practicing with Slipknot \"everything just clicked.\" Because of that, Colsefni was moved to backing vocals and percussion. However Colsefni was unhappy with his new role and left the band a month later. Since the band wanted to keep their percussive sound, Greg Welts joined the band to replace Colsefni. Towards the end of 1997, each band member picked a number to identify themselves. In 1998, Welts was kicked out of the band. He was replaced temporary by Brandon Darner and was replaced permanently by Chris Fehn. Slipknot wanted to have a DJ in the band, but had a hard time finding one because \"the people [they] knew who were DJs all sucked!\" Sid Wilson approached the band after seeing them live. He proceeded to impress the band with his ability and his antics; Wilson was considered \"Slipknot material\" and his hiring brought the band's line-up to nine members. The final change in the band's line-up came at the latter stages of the recording process of the band's debut album, Slipknot, in 1999. While the band took a break from recording the album, Brainard decided to leave the band and was replaced by Jim Root. Paul Gray died in May 2010 and was replaced in 2011 by Donnie Steele. Joey Jordison left in December 2013. In early 2014, Steele was replaced by Alessandro Venturella, and Jordison was replaced by Jay Weinberg. Chris Fehn was fired from the band in mid 2019. He was replaced by Michael Pfaff, who was originally dubbed by fans as \"Tortilla Man\". The band parted ways with Jones and Weinberg in 2023. Craig was replaced by Zac Baird before getting replaced by Jeff Karnowski while Weinberg was replaced Eloy Casagrande. ==Current members== * Corey Taylor (#8) ** Active: 1997–present ** Plays: lead vocals ** Performed in: all Slipknot albums from Slipknot (1999) to present ** Taylor was asked to join the band in 1997.

Colesfni would then leave the band. * Mick Thomson (#7) ** Active: 1996–present ** Plays: guitar ** Performed in: all Slipknot albums from Slipknot (1999) to present ** Just after Craig Jones joined the band as a guitarist, the band decided that he would move to samples.
