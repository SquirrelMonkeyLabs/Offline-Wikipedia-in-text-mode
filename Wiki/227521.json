 "text": "The Flag of the State of Maine has the state coat of arms on a blue field. In the center of the shield a moose rests under a tall pine tree. A farmer and seaman represent the normal reliance on agriculture and the sea by the state. The \"North Star\" represents the state motto: Dirigo (\"I Lead\"). == Old flag == Before the introduction of today’s flag, there was one introduced in 1901. It featured a green pine tree in the center and a blue star at the hoist, both on a beige background. Some people think it is a good alternative to the current flag because it is simpler.
