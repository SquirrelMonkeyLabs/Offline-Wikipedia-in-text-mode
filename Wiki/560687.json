 "text": "President-elect of the United States is the title used for an incoming president of the United States between the general election on Election Day in November and noon Eastern Standard Time on Inauguration Day, January 20. During this time, the elected nominee is not in office yet. Since the election for U.S. president is not by popular vote, the title is used for the apparent winner. The decision is finalized when votes of the Electoral College, cast in December, are counted by a joint session of Congress in early January. If the current president has won re-election, they are not given the title of president-elect because he or she is already in office and not waiting to become president. If a new president is scheduled to enter, then the current- standing one is said to hold the office on a lame duck basis. ==List of presidents-elect== President–elect President–elect Party Party From To 1 George Washington Nonpartisan April 6, 1789Date the House and Senate met in joint session to count the electoral votes, and declared Washington elected president April 30, 1789 2 John Adams Federalist December 1796 March 4, 1797 3 Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican February 17, 1801Date of election by House of Representatives March 4, 1801 4 James Madison Democratic- Republican December 1808 March 4, 1809 5 James Monroe Democratic-Republican December 1816 March 4, 1817 6 John Quincy Adams Democratic-Republican February 9, 1825 March 4, 1825 7 Andrew Jackson Democratic December 3, 1828 March 4, 1829 8 Martin Van Buren Democratic December 7, 1836 March 4, 1837 9 William Henry Harrison Whig December 2, 1840 March 4, 1841 10 James K.
