 "text": "Philosophy makes a basic distinction between a subject and an object: * A subject does things, it acts, and can make experiences. It is situated in relation to other subjects that exist outside itself. * An object is a thing that is observed or experienced by a subject. As a subject may experience or observe other subjects, these are objects in the view of the observer. The first modern philosopher to make this distinction was Ren√© Descartes. He made a distinction between mind and matter. Category:Philosophy",
