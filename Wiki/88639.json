It was directed by Australian Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the title roles. The movie is a version of Shakespeare's play designed to appeal to a younger modern audience. It is set in present-day fictional Verona Beach, Florida, but uses the style of language from the original novel. The fighting families (the Montagues and the Capulets) are represented as competing business empires, swords are replaced by guns etc. Despite the adaptation, the movie retains Shakespeare's original dialogue, though edited for modern cinema audiences. == Cast == * Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo Montague *Claire Danes as Juliet Capulet *John Leguizamo as Tybalt Capulet * Harold Perrineau as Mercutio * Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague * Dash Mihok as Benvolio Montague * Christina Pickles as Caroline Montague * Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet * Diane Venora as Gloria Capulet * Miriam Margolyes as Nurse Angelica * Paul Rudd as Dave Paris * Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Lawrence * Vondie Curtis-Hall as Captain Escalus Prince * Jesse Bradford as Balthasar * M.
