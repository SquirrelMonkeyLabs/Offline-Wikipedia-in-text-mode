As she was a member of the minor nobility, her marriage to the dauphin of France was never publicly announced. She was introduced to court as a lady-in-waiting to The Dowager Princess o Conti who was also very close to her half brother Louis of France, Dauphin of France, \"Le Grand Dauphin\". The first wife of the Dauphin, Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria died in 1690 leaving behind three children. Pregnant at the time of her secret marriage to the dauphin (thought to have taken place on 19 July 1694) she gave birth to a son who died two years after birth without being named.
