Russian political journalist Sergey Smirnov is the main editor of the website. Mediazona gives information on the judicial, law enforcement, and penal system in Russia. Since 2020 the site gives such news on Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Belarus too. Mediazona has a Russian media license, but Tolokonnikova said in 2016 that it could be taken away at any time. The site of Mediazona can't be opened in Belarus. On 30 January 2021, the main editor of Mediazona Sergey Smirnov was locked up by the police. == References == ==Other websites == * * Category:2014 establishments Category:Websites established in the 2010s Category:Russian websites Category:Kyrgyzstan Category:Kazakhstan Category:Censorship in Belarus Category:Free Media Award winners",
