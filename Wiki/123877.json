 "text": "Theodor Seuss Geisel (; March 2, 1904 â€“ September 24, 1991) was an American writer and cartoonist from Springfield, Massachusetts. He was better known by his pen name, Dr. Seuss. After World War I he was a sophomore in high school. He was not interested in sports. He pronounced his name , but it is often said as .A Seuss Shocker == Works == Geisel wrote more than 60 books. He got the ideas for his stories from the animal sounds from the nearby zoo, because he could hear them when he opened the window. Though most of them were published as Dr. Seuss, he also wrote 13 books as Theo. LeSieg and one as Rosetta Stone (a reference to the Rosetta Stone). Theodor Seuss Geisel is one of the most famous children's authors of all time. His books were known for catchy sentences. His books have sold over 222 million copies and they have been translated into more than 15 languages. In the years after his death in 1991, many books have been published based on his sketches and notes; these include Hooray for Diffendoofer Day! and Daisy-Head Mayzie. Though they were all published under the name Dr. Seuss, only My Many Colored Days, originally written in 1973, was entirely by Geisel. By the time of his death he had sold 200 million copies of his books. There is a museum devoted only for his books in Springfield, Mass. === As Dr. Seuss === * And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street (1937) * The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins (1938) * The King's Stilts (1939) * The Seven Lady Godivas (1940) * Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) * McElligot's Pool (Caldecott Honor Book, 1947) * Thidwick the Big- Hearted Moose (1948) * Bartholomew and the Oobleck (Caldecott Honor Book, 1949) * If I Ran the Zoo (Caldecott Honor Book, 1950) * Scrambled Eggs Super!
