 "text": "Marcelo Alberto Bonelli (Born, October 8, 1955) is an Argentine political and economics journalist. ==Biography== He began his career in 1985 on El Trece. Since 2005 he has been the host of the morning news show Arriba Argentinos on Channel 13. He writes for the newspaper Clarín. He is a fan of Racing Club. He has been awarded national and international prizes on various occasions: in 1997 he received the Konex Prize. In 1998 he received the Ondas Prize, awarded by Cadena Ser of Spain for the investigation carried out in the program A Dos Voces on the disappeared children in Argentina. ==Controversies== On March 17, 2017, the newspaper Clarín published an article by Bonelli in which he stated that, during an interview between the former president of the Spanish government Felipe González and President Mauricio Macri, the former had told him that \"no one is going to invest seriously in Argentina until Cristina's acts of corruption are judged and sentenced\", after asking \"When is Cristina going to go to jail?\". The former president responded by sending González and Macri two notes. He urged them to confirm what was stated in Bonelli's article, and considering that the Argentine president had the duty to reject demonstrations that \"import unprecedented extortion and undue interference in internal affairs, in addition to the exclusive recourse of justice.\" That day, González denied through his spokesman that the former President had maintained that position before the Argentine President, news that was published by the newspaper in a note by Bonelli himself, in which he insisted that what he had published was true. In the same sense, Felipe González spoke and asked the newspaper to clarify the situation, which the newspaper did not. ==References== == Other websites == * Fundación Konex * La Nación Category:Living people Category:Argentine journalists Category:1955 births",
