 "text": "Charles Edward Anderson \"Chuck\" Berry (October 18, 1926 - March 18, 2017) was an American singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is one of the original musicians who helped to create rock and roll and is known as the Father of Rock and Roll. ==Career== In 1955 Berry met Muddy Waters who told him of a record company that would release his first song. In 1957 he joined the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and other popular musicians on a tour around the United States. Over the next few years he became more and more popular and had many popular songs on the radio. \"Maybellene\" (1955), \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958) were massive hits. He has influenced many rock and pop musicians who came after him.M. Campbell (ed) Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), pp. 168-9. Berry has influenced many music artists, like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan. Berry tried to help an Apache waitress cross the US-Canadian border, but was caught by police and charged for prostitution. This dented his career: he served 18 months. When released, his first recording was \"Nadine\", (1964) also a huge hit. Berry was a favorite with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys, who adapted and recorded a number of his songs. In 1986 a documentary film, Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, was made. It featured a celebration concert for Berry's sixtieth birthday, organized by Keith Richards. ==Death== Berry died at his home in Wentzville, Missouri on March 18, 2017 from a congestive heart failure, aged 90. ==Discography== *Chuck Berry discography ==References== == Other websites == * Official website * * Category:1926 births Category:2017 deaths Category:African-American musicians Category:African-American singers Category:American criminals Category:American prisoners Category:American robbers Category:American rock guitarists Category:American rock singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:Singers from St. Louis, Missouri Category:Musicians from St. Louis, Missouri",
