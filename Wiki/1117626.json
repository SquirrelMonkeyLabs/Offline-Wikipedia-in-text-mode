 "text": "The Hellenic State, was the collaborationist government (and Axis puppet state) located in Greece during the occupation by axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria) from 1941-1944 during the Second World War. In 1941, the axis powers invaded Greece as part of the campaign against the allies in the balkans, the invasion was successful and the puppet regime was installed. Not all parts of Greece were under control by the regime, some parts were annexed by the occupying axis powers. Most of eastern Macedonia and Thrace were annexed by Bulgaria. (Italy and Germany also had occupation zones in Greece) During the occupation, resistance movements like EAM sprung up against the occupiers. (they were also present in Albania) In September 1943, Italy joined the allies after the Allied invasion there, then Germany launched operation Achse to disarm the Italians in Greece. Bulgaria joined the allies in September 1944 after the Soviets invaded. The Germans were now evacuating. At the same time, the British landed to liberate Greece from occupation. Athens was liberated in October and the collaborationist government went into exile before dissolving shortly-after. Category:History of Greece",
