 "text": "Chuck is an American television series that started on the NBC network on September 24, 2007 and ended on January 27, 2012. The series is about Chuck Bartowski, a normal guy who fixes computers at the Buy More store in Burbank, California, as part of the \"Nerd Herd\". His old friend Bryce turns out to be a rogue spy. Just before he dies, Bryce sends Chuck an e-mail with thousands of pictures. The pictures are encoded with all of the nation's spy secrets. After viewing them, Chuck holds all of the secrets inside his head (with his flashes as the intersect). Chuck is watched by agents from the CIA and the NSA, who hope to use Chuck's secrets to protect the United States from terrorism. The humor elements of the show involve a satire of the Best Buy chain of electronics stores. The show wanted to use \"Geek Squad\" to describe the main characters' job. But Best Buy asked for them to change the name. So the characters on Chuck were called \"Nerd Herd\" instead. In fact, the exterior shots of the Burbank Buy More store where Chuck and Morgan work are a former Mervyn's store in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park, California. ==References== == Other websites == *Official NBC site * Category:2007 American television series debuts Category:2012 American television series endings Category:2000s American television series Category:2010s American television series Category:American science fiction television series Category:American sitcoms Category:Burbank, California Category:NBC network series Category:Spy television series Category:Television series set in Los Angeles County, California Category:English-language television programs",
