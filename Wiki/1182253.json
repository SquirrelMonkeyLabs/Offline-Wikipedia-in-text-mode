Mac OS X 10.1 was released on September 25, 2001, as a free update for Mac OS X 10.0 users. The operating system was handed out for free by Apple employees after Steve Jobs' keynote speech at the Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco. It was subsequently distributed to Mac users on October 25, 2001, at Apple Stores and other retail stores that carried Apple products. Mac OS X 10.1 was codenamed \"Puma\" because the internal team thought it was \"one fast cat.\"[2] In January 2002, Apple switched to using Mac OS X as the default OS on all new Macs at the time starting with the 10.1.2 release, replacing Mac OS 9.[3] ==System requirements== Supported computers: *Power Mac G3[4] *Power Mac G4[4] *Power Mac G4 Cube[4] *iMac G3[4] *iMac G4,[4] *eMac,[4] *PowerBook G3, except for the original PowerBook G3[4] *PowerBook G4[4] *iBook[4] RAM: *128 megabytes[4] (MB) (unofficially 64 MB minimum) Hard Drive Space: *1.5 gigabytes[4] (GB) ==Release history== Version Build Date Notes 10.1 5G64 25.09.2001 Original retail CD-ROM release 10.1.1 5M28 12.11.2001 10.1.2 5P48 21.12.2001 10.1.3 5Q45 19.02.2002 10.1.4 5Q125 17.04.2002 10.1.5 5S60 05.06.2002 [5] ==References== 1\\. 2\\. 3\\. 4\\. 5\\.
