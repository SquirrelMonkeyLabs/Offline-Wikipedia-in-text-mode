 "text": "The A5M Claude was a Japanese fighter aircraft made by Mitsubishi. It first flew in 1935 and was introduced in 1937. It was the first monoplane (fixed- wing aircraft with one set of wings) that could work from an aircraft carrier. It was similar to the P-26 Peashooter, an American monoplane fighter. It fought in the second Sino-Japanese War. After the Pearl Harbor attacks, it was not good enough to fight against American fighters like the Curtiss P-40 and the F4F Wildcat, so it was replaced by the A6M Zero. Near the end of WW2, many A5Mâ€™s were pulled out of retirement to be used as suicidal kamikaze aircraft. ==Related pages== *A6M Zero == References == Category:Military aviation Category:Military of Japan Category:Mitsubishi Category:World War II Japanese aircraft",
