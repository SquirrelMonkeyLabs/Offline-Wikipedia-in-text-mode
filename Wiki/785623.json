 "text": "Bluestar's Prophecy is a teen fantasy novel in the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. This is the second Warriors \"Super Edition\" (a standalone story that is longer than most Warriors books). The main character is a cat named Bluestar. The book tells her life story, from her birth to the day she becomes leader of a group of cats called ThunderClan. It was published by HarperCollins and released on 28 July 2009. ==Plot== Bluestar is called Bluekit, Bluepaw, and Bluefur during different parts of her life. Bluestar's Prophecy follows the life of Bluestar, the leader of ThunderClan. The book starts with a prologue that recounts Bluestar's death in A Dangerous Path. The book then goes back to Bluestar's childhood, during which Goosefeather, the Clan's medicine cat, receives a prophecy about Bluepaw being a fire that will blaze through the forest, but who will be destroyed by water. A few moons later, Bluepaw's mother, Moonflower, is killed in a battle. Bluestar's childhood is defined by her relationship with her sister, Snowfur, which is damaged when Snowfur falls in love with Thistleclaw, whom Bluefur finds arrogant and untrustworthy. Snowfur is later killed when she is hit by a car, leaving a heartbroken Bluefur to care for Snowfur's son, Whitekit. Bluefur later meets a RiverClan warrior named Oakheart, and although they do not like each other at first, they eventually fall in love. They decide to spend one night together, but agree that for the good of their Clans, they will never meet again afterwards. One moon later, Bluefur is horrified to find out that she is expecting kittens. Thrushpelt, a ThunderClan warrior with feelings for Bluefur, offers to help her take care of her kits. Bluefur accepts his offer, allowing the rest of ThunderClan to believe that Thrushpelt is the father of her kits. Sunstar, ThunderClan's leader, tells Bluefur that he was planning to make her ThunderClan's new deputy (second-in-command), but because of her kittens, he will promote Thistleclaw to deputy instead. After having a vision of Thistleclaw drenched in blood, Bluefur realizes that allowing him to become deputy and then leader would be deadly to the Clan. She decides to take her three kits to Oakheart and let them be raised in RiverClan. During this, one of her kits, Mosskit, freezes to death. Her other kits, Mistykit and Stonekit, make it to RiverClan. She explains the disappearance of her kits by pretending they have been taken by a starving fox. Without her kits, Bluefur is made deputy. After Sunstar dies, she becomes leader, taking on the name Bluestar. After successfully leading ThunderClan for several seasons, she receives a prophecy from the ThunderClan medicine cat (healer), Spottedleaf: “Fire alone can save our Clan.” Later, while walking by a human town, she catches sight of a bright ginger house cat named Rusty. Recognizing him as the cat from Spottedleaf's prophecy, she names him Firepaw and takes him into ThunderClan. ==References== Category:Warriors books Category:2009 books",
