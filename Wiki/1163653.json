 "text": "The Nepal–Britain Treaty was signed on 21 December 1923 in Singha Durbar. The treaty was the first formal acceptance by the British that Nepal is an independent country. It also has the right to conduct its foreign policy in any way it saw fit. It is said to be “a great achievement of 25 years of Chandra Shumsher’s diplomacy.” The treaty was recorded in 1925 in the League of Nations. ==Notes== ==References== Category:History of Nepal Category:1923 in Asia",
