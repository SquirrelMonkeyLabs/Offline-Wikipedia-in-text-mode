 "text": "Fakemon, also called Fakémon, are fake creatures based on the Pokémon games. Most Fakemon are made as fan art, others are made to trick people into thinking they are real and will appear in new games. Fakemon designs have occasionally been so similar to the visual language of Pokémon that they have been confused for real Pokémon that weren't revealed yet. An example of this was when in 2018 people believed that fake starter Pokémon made by Leopolda Spagna were going to be in the real Pokémon games. ==References== Category:Fictional characters",
