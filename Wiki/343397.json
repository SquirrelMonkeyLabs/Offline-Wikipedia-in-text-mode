Excerpt 1: \"Ildenizids or Eldiguzids, a line of Atabegs of Turkish slave commanders who governed most of northwestern Persia, including Arran, most of Azarbaijan, and Djibal, during the second half of the 6th/12th century and the early decades of the 7th/13th century\". Excerpt 2: \"The Turkish Ildenizids shared to the full in the Perso-Islamic civilization\" (, ) or Ildenizids, also known as Atabegs of Azerbaijan ( Atabakan-e Āzarbayjan, ) A historical state that ruled Azerbaijan, eastern Anatolia, northern Iraq, Iran and Jibali in 1136–1225. ==History== The start of the dynasty is connected with Shamsaddin Eldaniz of Kipchak origin. Thus, Eldaniz, who took Arran as an iqta by Sultan Masud, soon spread his power throughout Azerbaijan. After his son Arslanshah also ruled in 1160, Eldaniz seized power in the Seljuk sultanate of Iraq. During the reign of Shamsaddin Eldaniz, the lands covered Arran, Azerbaijan, Shirvan, Cibal, Hamadan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Rey, Mosul, Kirman, Persia, Khuzistan, Akhlat, Erzurum and Maragha.ere a Turkic dynasty of Kipchak origin. They controlled most of northwestern Persia, eastern Transcaucasia, including Arran, most of Azerbaijan, and Djibal. At their biggest, the land they had was about most of north-western and upper- central modern Iran, most of the regions of modern Azerbaijan and smaller portions in modern Armenia, Turkey and Iraq.İradə Nuriyeva.s.18. The strengthening of the dynasty is connected with the period of Mohammad Jahan Pahlava. After the death of Sultan Arslanshah in 1175, Jahan Pahlavan, who brought his 7-year-old son Togrul III to power, declared himself his ancestor and, like Shamsaddin Eldaniz, took de facto power.Antoine Constant. L'Azerbaïdjan, Karthala Editions, 2002, , p. 96 Atabey Jahan Pahlavan suppressed revolts against the central government and established friendly relations with the ruling dynasties in the neighborhood. Since the period of Jahan Pahlava was a period of stability, cultural spheres developed in the lands under the rule of the Eldenizs. During the reign of the mentioned Atabey, the capital of the Eldenizs was moved from Nakhchivan to Hamadan. ==Atabeg== Atabeg means \"father lord\" in Turkic languages. It was the title given to the Turkic officers of Seljuq dynasty.Hodgson, Marshall G.S. The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization, University of Chicago Press, 1974, , p. 260 Atabegs were not only vice-regents, but also de facto rulers. == List of Eldiguzids (Atabegs of Azerbaijan) == # Shams al- Din Ildeniz or Eldigüz (ca.1135 or 1136-1174 or 1175) # Mohammed Jahan Pahlavan (1174 or 1175–1186) # Qizil Arslan (1186–1191) # Abu Bakr (1191–1210) # Uzbek (1210–1225) == References == Category:Medieval Azerbaijan Category:History of Iran Category:Azerbaijani dynasties Category:Royal dynasties",
