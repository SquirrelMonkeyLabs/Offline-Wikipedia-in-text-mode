 "text": "\"Young\" is the debut solo single by English singer and songwriter Tulisa from her debut solo studio album, The Female Boss. It was released as the album's lead single on 29 April 2012. \"Young\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart as well as number five in the Republic of Ireland. ==Background== Ali Tennant wrote the lyrics for \"Young\" with STL, a production duo comprising Pete Ibsen and Fazer. Tulisa heard both Fazer and Isben and wanted to record the song herself and said that \"They didn't even get a chance to pitch it to the [other singer], they were preparing it, it wasn't even finished and I was like, 'I'm having that song, give it to me'.\" Tulisa wanted it to sound like a song that would be played in Ibiza and at summer festivals with young people jumping and singing along to its hook. It became Tulisa's first and only number one single. ==Track listing== === European Digital EP === # \"Young\" – 3:35 # \"Young\" (Preditah Mix) – 3:20 # \"Young\" (Breeze & Modulate Mix) – 3:38 # \"Young\" (Expanda Mix) – 4:35 # \"Young\" (Agent X Mix) – 3:22 === North American/Mexican Digital Remixes === # \"Young\" (Gregor Salto Edit) - 3:16 # \"Young\" (Gregor Salto Extended) - 5:34 # \"Young\" (Gregor Salto Extended) - 5:16 # \"Young\" (Gregor Salto Dub) - 3:36 # \"Young\" (Vice Edit) - 3:29 # \"Young\" (Vice Extended) - 6:00 # \"Young\" (Vice Instrumental) - 6:00 # \"Young\" (Expanda Remix Edit) - 3:29 # \"Young\" (Expanda Remix) - 4:33 # \"Young\" (Expanda Remix Instrumental) - 4:33 # \"Young\" (Hector Fonseca Edit) - 4:03 # \"Young\" (Hector Fonseca Club) - 6:02 # \"Young\" (Hector Fonseca Dub) - 5:32 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2012) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2012) Position UK Singles (OCC) 43 ==Certification== ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Ireland Digital download All Around the World United Kingdom United States 29 July 2012 Island Records ==References== Category:2012 songs Category:Debut singles Category:Tulisa songs Category:Dance songs Category:House songs Category:R&B; songs",
