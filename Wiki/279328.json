 "text": "Sargon II (, \"legitimate king\", reigned 722 – 705 BC) was an Assyrian king. Sargon II became co-regent with Shalmaneser V in 722 BC. Shalmaneser V died in 722 BC. From then on, Sargon II was the only ruler of Assyria. It is not clear if he was the son of Tiglath-Pileser III or a usurper unrelated to the royal family. In his inscriptions, he styles himself as a new man and rarely talks about his predecessors. He nevertheless took the name Sharru-kinu (\"true king\"), after Sargon of Akkad — who had founded the first Semitic Empire in the region about 16 centuries earlier.Another \"Sargon\", a predecessor of Shamshi-Adad of the 18th century BC. Sargon is the Biblical form of the name. ==References== Category:Assyrian people Category:8th-century BC births Category:705 BC deaths Category:8th-century BC people",
