 "text": "Benidorm is a British sitcom written and created by Derren Litten and produced by Tiger Aspect Productions for ITV that aired for ten series from 1 February 2007 until 2 May 2018. The series features an ensemble cast of holiday makers and staff at the Solana all-inclusive hotel in Benidorm, Spain over the course of a week each year. == Story == Each series, different families and couples arrive in an all-inclusive hotel in Benidorm. There are many different characters and storylines throughout the series. == Behind the scenes == The Solana is the fictional hotel featured in the show, where most of the characters stay. The pool scenes are filmed at the Sol Pelicanos Ocas Hotel in Benidorm, and the room scenes are filmed in the Acuariam II Apartments (which overlook the pool). The reception area and the salon is filmed in a studio set in a building opposite Benidorm Palace, known as \"The Pink House\". Neptune's is an all-inclusive bar/restaurant featured in the show, and owned by The Solana. Most of the characters are seen here in the evening, where seemingly there is karaoke and live entertainment every night. == Cancellation and Revived == After the end of the tenth season, it was confirmed that the show would not return. This was because fewer people were watching the show in its final years In 2025, Darren Little confirms he's in talks with ITV to bring back sitcom 7 years after it was cancelled. == Viewing figures == Series Episodes Year Series average (in millions) 1 6 2007 4.43 2 8 2008 5.98 Special 2009 5.23 3 6 6.52 Special 2010 7.41 4 6 2011 7.77 5 7 2012 7.06 6 7 2014 6.76 7 7 2015 5.60 8 7 2016 5.32 9 9 2017 4.78 10 9 2018 4.98 == List of main characters and cast members == Color box Main Recurring Guest Not appeared / No appearance === Hotel Managers === Character Actor Series 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Janey Yorke Crissy Rock colspan=\"4\" colspan=\"3\" Joyce Temple-Savage Sherrie Hewson colspan=\"4\" colspan=\"6\" === Hotel Team === Character Actor Series 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Mateo Castellanos Jake Canuso colspan=\"10\" Les/Lesley Conroy Tim Healy colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"7\" Kenneth Du Beke Tony Maudsley colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"7\" Liam Conroy Adam Gillen colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"4\" colspan=\"2\" === Hotel Guests === Character Actor Series 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Kate Weedon Abigail Cruttenden colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\" Martin Weedon Nicholas Burns colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\" Noreen Maltby Elsie Kelly colspan=\"5\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\" Geoff Maltby Johnny Vegas colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\" Mick Garvey Steve Pemberton colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" Janice Garvey Siobhan Finneran colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" Madge Harvey Sheila Reid colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\" Michael Garvey Oliver Stokes colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" Chantelle Garvey Hannah Hobley colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"7\" Jacqueline Stewart Janine Duvitski colspan=\"10\" Donald Stewart Kenny Ireland colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"4\" Gavin Ramsbottom Hugh Sachs colspan=\"5\" colspan=\"5\" Troy Ramsbottom Paul Bazely colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" Mel Harvey Geoffrey Hutchings colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"7\" Brandy Sheridan Smith colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"7\" Sam Wood Shelley Longworth colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" Natalie Jones Kathryn Drysdale colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"6\" Pauline Maltby Selina Griffiths colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"3\" Trudy Michelle Butterly colspan=\"4\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"5\" Clive Dyke Perry Benson colspan=\"5\" colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"3\" Tonya Dyke Hannah Waddingham colspan=\"5\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\" Tiger Dyke Danny Walters colspan=\"5\" colspan=\"4\" colspan=\"1\" Bianca Dyke Bel Powley colspan=\"5\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"4\" Glynn Flint Alan David colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" Terri Dawson Charlotte Eaton colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"3\" Monty Evans/Staines John Challis colspan=\"6\" colspan=\"3\" colspan=\"1\" Eddie Dawson Bobby Knutt colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"3\" Billy Dawson Steve Edge colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"3\" Sheron Dawson Julie Graham colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"3\" Rob Dawson Josh Bolt colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"3\" Jodie Dawson Honor Kneafsey colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"2\" colspan=\"1\" Joey Ellis Nathan Bryon colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"3\" Amber Platt Jessica Ellerby colspan=\"7\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"2\" Loretta Chase Kate Fitzgerald colspan=\"8\" colspan=\"2\" Neville Simon Greenall colspan=\"8\" colspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\" Callum Julian Moore-Cook colspan=\"9\" colspan=\"1\" Cyd Laila Zaidi colspan=\"9\" colspan=\"1\" ==References== ==Other websites== * *Benidorm at British TV Comedy *Benidorm at TigerAspect.co.uk *Solana at Sol Pel√≠canos Ocas Category:2007 British television series debuts Category:2018 British television series endings Category:2000s British sitcoms Category:2010s British sitcoms Category:ITV comedy Category:ITV television programmes Category:English- language television programs",
