 "text": "The nasal septum separates the left and right airways in the nose and divides the two nostrils. ==Composition== The fleshy external end of the nasal septum is sometimes also called columella. The nasal septum is composed of three structures: * ethmoid bone * vomer bone * quadrangular cartilage ==Clinical significance== The nasal septum can depart from the centreline of the nose; this condition is known as a deviated septum. Injury, excessive nose-picking and cocaine usage can cause septum perforations, or holes developing in the septum. An operation to the nasal septum is known as a septoplasty. ==Additional images== Image:Gray191.png|Horizontal section of nasal and orbital cavities.
