 "text": "In Ancient Egyptian religion, Medjed (Egyptological: ) is a minor deity mentioned in certain copies of the Book of the Dead. While not much is known about the deity, his ghost-like depiction in the Greenfield papyrus has earned him popularity in modern Japanese culture, and he has appeared as a character in video games and anime. == In popular culture == After the Greenfield papyrus illustrations were exhibited in 2012 at the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and the Fukuoka Museum of Art, Medjed became an internet meme on Japanese social media, thanks largely to his \"cartoon ghost\"-like appearance.Cariddi (2018), p. 204.Salvador (2017), p. 11. He has since entered into Japanese popular culture and has appeared in video games (e.g., Fate/Grand Order)Salvador (2017), pp. 17â€“18. and anime (e.g., Kamigami no Ki and Oh, Suddenly Egyptian God). In the 2016 Japanese video game Persona 5, his name is used for a fictional antagonistic hacker group that describe themselves as the \"true executors of justice\". ==Gallery== File:Medjed Cairo 95658.png|alt=A vignette from a larger papyrus scroll.
