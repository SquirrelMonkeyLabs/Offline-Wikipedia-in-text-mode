 "text": "Luc Bourdon (February 16, 1987 – May 29, 2008) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) and their American Hockey League (AHL) partner, the Manitoba Moose, from 2006 until 2008. After having childhood arthritis, he was selected third overall in the 2003 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) draft and played for the Val-d'Or Foreurs, Moncton Wildcats, and Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, playing four seasons in the QMJHL. The Canucks drafted Bourdon with their first selection, the tenth overall selection, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Known as a strong defenceman who could help score goals, Bourdon represented Canada in three international tournaments, winning two gold medals at the IIHF World U20 Championship and a silver medal at the IIHF World U18 Championship. Bourdon died at the age of 21 near his hometown of Shippagan, New Brunswick, when his motorcycle collided with a tractor trailer. == Career statistics == === Regular season and playoffs === Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 2002–03 Miramichi Rae's Yamaha Rivermen NBMHL 20 2 12 14 106 — — — — — 2003–04 Val-d'Or Foreurs QMJHL 64 2 6 8 58 7 1 0 1 4 2004–05 Val-d'Or Foreurs QMJHL 70 13 19 32 117 — — — — — 2005–06 Val-d'Or Foreurs QMJHL 20 2 18 20 54 — — — — — 2005–06 Moncton Wildcats QMJHL 10 1 7 8 8 16 0 3 3 22 2006–07 Vancouver Canucks NHL 9 0 0 0 4 — — — — — 2006–07 Moncton Wildcats QMJHL 13 3 11 14 28 — — — — — 2006–07 Cape Breton Screaming Eagles QMJHL 23 1 5 6 45 16 2 11 13 28 2006–07 Manitoba Moose AHL — — — — — 5 0 0 0 2 2007–08 Vancouver Canucks NHL 27 2 0 2 20 — — — — — 2007–08 Manitoba Moose AHL 41 6 8 14 68 6 0 0 0 8 QMJHL totals 200 22 66 88 310 39 3 14 17 54 AHL totals 41 6 8 14 68 11 0 0 0 10 NHL totals 36 2 0 2 24 — — — — — === International === Year Team Event GP G A Pts PIM 2005 Canada U18 6 0 1 1 4 2006 Canada WJC 6 1 5 6 4 2007 Canada WJC 6 2 2 4 6 Junior int'l totals Junior int'l totals Junior int'l totals 18 3 8 11 14 * All statistics taken from NHL.com == References == == Other websites == * Category:1987 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Canadian ice hockey defencemen Category:Cape Breton Screaming Eagles players Category:Ice hockey people from New Brunswick Category:Manitoba Moose players Category:Moncton Wildcats players Category:Road accident deaths Category:Val-d'Or Foreurs players Category:Vancouver Canucks players",
