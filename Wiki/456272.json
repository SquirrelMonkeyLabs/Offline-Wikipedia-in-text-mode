 "text": "Unikonts are one of the five superkingdoms in the classification of eukaryotes. They are part of the taxonomy system of Thomas Cavalier-Smith. The term is no longer used. It is replaced by the term Amorphea.Roger AJ, Simpson AG 2009. Evolution: revisiting the root of the eukaryote tree. Current Biology. 19 (4): R165â€“R167. PMID 19243692 == Clade == The group is claimed to be a clade. It includes eukaryotic cells that: *have a single flagellum, or *are amoebae with no flagella. The unikonts include opisthokonts (animals, fungi, and related forms) and Amoebozoa. By contrast other well-known eukaryotic groups are often referred to as bikonts. Bikonts include Archaeplastida (plants and relatives), Excavata, Rhizaria, and Chromalveolata. These groups may have two flagella (although there are many exceptions). == Characteristics == The unikonts have a triple-gene fusion that is lacking in the bikonts. The three genes code for enzymes which make pyrimidine nucleotides. This must have involved a double gene fusion, a rare pair of events, which supports the shared ancestry of Opisthokonta and Amoebozoa. == References == Category:Eukaryotes",
