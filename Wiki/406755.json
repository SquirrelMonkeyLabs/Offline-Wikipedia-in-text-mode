 "text": "The term dental caries refers to tooth decay or cavities in teeth. The decay comes from normal bacteria in your mouth. When you eat sugar, these bacteria create acid which create caivities in your teeth. Dental caries usually lead to substandard breath and bad taste. Personal hygiene caring consists of brushing,establishing good pH level by eating dairy products like yogurt,cheese,etc. and flossing daily. After the enamel, the strong outer layer of your teeth, and the dentin are destroyed, the cavity reaches the dental pulp and nerves of the tooth, the tooth becomes sensitive since the nerves are exposed. Cavity may infect the jaw and sometimes cause a tooth abscess. If carbohydrates (sugar) remain in your mouth for enough time, caries-causing bacteria may form a biofilm called plaque on the tooth surface and attack the tooth. == References == Category:Dental problems",
