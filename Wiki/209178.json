The Rock is on the cover of the game. It is the third game in the WWF SmackDown! series, the first for the PlayStation 2, and the last under the WWF name, as the World Wrestling Federation was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) after a legal dispute with the World Wildlife Fund. It is the sequel to WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role and was followed by WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth. The game was released in Europe on November 16, 2001, in North America on November 19, 2001 and in Japan on January 24, 2002.

It received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), selling at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. == References == Category:2001 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Professional wrestling video games Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:WWE video games Category:Yuke's games",
