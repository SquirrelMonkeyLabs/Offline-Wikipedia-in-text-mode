 "text": "Phasmahyla lisbella is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Fazenda Ventania in Área de Protecão Ambiental Ventania. People have seen it between 536 and 1,000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 30.4–34.4 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of its back is bright green in color with very small dark brown spots. There is a yellow and brown pattern on its sides. This frog can change color. It is bright green during the day and green-brown at night. Scientists think this may may make the frog hard to see while it is resting during the day. This frog can have purple marks on its skin. The male frogs sit on plants hanging over a stream and sing for the female frogs. Like other frogs in Phasmahyla, this frog does not lay eggs in the water. Instead, the female frog climbs to a tree branch over the water. She folds a leaf into a pocket shape. She puts her eggs in the pocket. She uses special glue to hold the pocket shut. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall down into the water. Scientists named this frog after Lis Alves Pereira de Oliveira da Rocha and Bella Alves Pereira Custódio da Rocha. Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying because it lives in such a small place and because human beings cut down the forest where it lives to make farms and tree farms, make places for cows to eat grass, and to build towns. Scientists also believe people might catch these frogs to sell as pets. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
