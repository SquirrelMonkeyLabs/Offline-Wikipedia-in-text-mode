 "text": "In number theory a Carmichael number is a composite positive integer n, which satisfies the congruence b^{n-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{n} for all integers b which are relatively prime to n. Being relatively prime means that they do not have common divisors, other than 1. Such numbers are named after Robert Carmichael. All prime numbers p satisfy b^{p-1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{p} for all integers b which are relatively prime to p. This has been proven by the famous mathematician Pierre de Fermat. In most cases if a number n is composite, it does not satisfy this congruence equation. So, there exist not so many Carmichael numbers. We can say that Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that behave a little bit like they would be a prime number. Category:Number theory Category:Integer sequences",
