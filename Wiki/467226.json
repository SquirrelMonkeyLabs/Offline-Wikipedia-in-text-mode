 "text": "The national flag of South Africa was first adopted in April 1994. It was designed by Frederick Brownell in March 1994. == Appearance == It has horizontal bands of red (on the top) and blue (on the bottom), It is separated by a central green band which splits into a horizontal \"Y\" shape. The design and hues encapsulate key elements from the country's flag history. Each color or combination holds unique significance for various individuals, thus no singular symbolism should be universally applied. The central motif of the flag, originating at the flagpole in a 'V' shape and extending into a solitary horizontal stripe towards the outer edge, symbolizes the amalgamation of varied facets within South African society, progressing collectively into the future. This motif resonates with the ethos of convergence and unity, echoing the motto \"Unity is Strength\" from the former South African Coat of Arms. == History == == References== South Africa Category:1994 establishments in South Africa Category:National symbols of South Africa trent was here",
