It is called the \"Tomb of Jesus\" (Kirisuto no haka). It's also where Jesus' last descendants, the family of Sajiro Sawaguchi, lives. The Sawaguchi family says that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead, his brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross. Jesus left, and he went through Siberia to Mutsu Province (in northern Japan). Once in Japan, he changed his name to Torai Tora Daitenku. He became a rice farmer, and he married a twenty-year old Japanese woman named Miyuko. He raised three daughters near what is now Shingō. While in Japan, he supposedly traveled around. He supposedly died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in the mound said to be the grave of Jesus Christ. Another mound near the supposed grave of Jesus is said to have an ear of the brother of Jesus. It is also said to have some hair from Mary, the mother of Jesus. They were the only things from his family that Jesus could carry when he left Judaea.Bird, Winifred, \"Behold! Christ's grave in Shingo, Aomori Prefecture\", Japan Times, 25 December 2011, p. 10. The claims started in 1933 after the people found supposed \"ancient Hebrew documents about Jesus' life and death in Japan.\" They were supposedly the from Jesus. These documents are called the Takeuchi Documents. They are said to be very old documents that were passed down through the family of Takeuchi Kiyomaro. The documents were supposedly taken by the Japanese authorities, and the documents were taken to Tokyo, shortly before World War II. They have not been seen since. However, someone has recently claimed to have recovered the entire story of Jesus in Japan from the Takenouchi documents. That the entire story of Jesus in Japan was copied into the designs of Nijo Castle gate before they were lost. The video he released contains many additional detail of the story that have never before been heard.
