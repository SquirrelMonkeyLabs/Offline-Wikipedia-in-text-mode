 "text": "The Japanese dwarf flying squirrel (Pteromys momonga) lives in forests on Honshu and Kyushu islands. They eat buds, leaves, bark and fruits. The International Union for Conservation of Nature do it as a \"least-concern species\". ==Appearance== Its body is 14–20 cm long and the tail length is 10–14 cm. It is much smaller than the Japanese giant flying squirrel. Its back is covered with grey brown hair, and its belly is white. It has large eyes and a flattened tail. Species of flying squirrels possess a patagium, which is a skin membrane used in gliding. In this particular species of flying squirrel their patagium spans between their wrists and ankles, but not between their legs and tail. ==Living areas== It is native to Japan where it inhabits sub- alpine forests and boreal evergreen forests on Honshu and Kyushu islands. Japanese dwarf flying squirrels make their nests in the cavities of trees,or at the cross point between branches and tree trunks. These squirrels also tend to line their nests with mosses and lichens.Tree cavities are very important nest resources for them. They tend to nest in conifers, such as pine and spruce, more than broad-leaved trees. ==Food and water== It eats seeds, fruit, tree leaves, buds and bark. It can leap from tree. ==Reproduction== Breeding form is embryonic. Birth 2 - 6 cubs in 2 times a year at a time. ==Threats== Old forests and deciduous broad-leaved forests with trees for nesting are decreasing and they are divided ==Relationship with humans== They also eats acorns etc. in natural forest. This habit can be compatible with forestry and coexistence with humans is possible. It is because we only need to leave some natural forests when planting cedar. ==References== Category:Squirrels Category:Mammals of Japan",
