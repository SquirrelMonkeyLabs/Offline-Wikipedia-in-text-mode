A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859. Aboriginal Studies Press. 1995 . They had lived in the grasslands around the lakes for at least 30,000 years. European settlers moved into the area in 1837. Within three years, most of Gulidjan lands had been taken over by sheep farmers. The first European settler was Hugh Murray. In 1848, the town was named \"Lake Colac\". === Brookhouse Mystery=== In 1854 a shepherd, Thomas Brookhouse, who worked for Hugh Murray went missing. Another shepherd, Patrick McGeary left the town soon afterwards. Fifteen years later, Brookhouse's bones were found under a pile of rocks near Lake Corangamite. The skull had been crushed. It took police another two years to find McGeary, who was found guilty of murder and hanged in Melbourne in 1871. He had killed Brookhouse to stop him from telling Murray about his sheep stealing.http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&d;=WI18711208.2.13 == Town features== The Lake Colac Post Office opened on 1 July 1848.
