The male has a red iris, black shoulders and wings, a long black bill and rich yellow plumes along its sides and stomach. From the rear of these plumes come twelve blackish, wire-like filaments, which bend back near their bases to sweep forward over the birds hindquarters. The female is a brown bird with black-barred buffy underparts. Its feet are strong, large-clawed and pink in color. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Seleucidis. The male displays on an exposed vertical perch with its breast-shield flared. They eat fruits and arthropods. The bird is found in lowland forests, New Guinea and Salawati Island of Irian Jaya. == References == * Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concern Category:Paradisaeidae Category:Birds of Oceania",
