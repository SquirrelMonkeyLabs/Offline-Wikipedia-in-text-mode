 "text": "Bambaradeniya's shrub frog (Pseudophilautus bambaradeniyai) is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Sripada Peak, Peak Wilderness, between 700 and 1400 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 17.3 â€“ 20.2 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color with darker marks. There is a dark mark between the eyes. There is a nearly white stripe from the nose to the rear end and on parts of the legs. The feet are lighter in color than the back. There are fewer of this frog than there were in the past. Scientists say that this is because human beings cut down forests to make towns and cities and to get wood to build with. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
