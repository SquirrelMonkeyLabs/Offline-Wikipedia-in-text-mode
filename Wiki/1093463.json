 "text": "The Waterbomb is an origami cube made to hold water. You only need one piece of paper to create this marvel. You will start by making a triangle base, then fold it into a square, and finally lock the sides together and inflate your cube. This is also used to imitate a water balloon, so it's like a origami water balloon. You can use a different type of textured paper to make this so then when you fill it with water it won't disintegrate. Category:Origami",
