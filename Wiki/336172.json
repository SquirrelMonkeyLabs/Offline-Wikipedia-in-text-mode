 "text": "The Provinces of the Philippines are the main political and administrative divisions of the Philippines. There are 82 provinces at present. The provinces are divided into cities and municipalities. The National Capital Region, as well as independent cities, are separate from any provincial government. Each province has a governor. The provinces are grouped into seventeen regions based on geographical, cultural, and ethnological characteristics. Fourteen of these regions are designated with numbers corresponding to their geographic location in order from north to south. The National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao do not have numerical designations. Each province is member to the League of Provinces of the Philippines, an organization which aims to address issues affecting provincial and metropolitan government administrations. ==List of provinces== Province Capital Largest settlement Region Population (2020) Population rank Area (km²) Area rank Pop. density (per km²) Pop. density rank Abra Bangued Bangued CAR 250,985 69 4,198.20 33 76 Agusan del NorteFigures include the independent city of Butuan.
