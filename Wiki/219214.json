American Journal of Botany 91: 1508-1522. All or most of them are single- celled photosynthetic phytoplankton. The cells typically have two slightly unequal flagella and a unique organelle called a haptonema. This is superficially similar to a flagellum, but differs in its arrangement of microtubules, and in its use. The name comes from the Greek hapsis = touch, and nema = thread. == Classification == Molecular and morphological evidence places them in five orders; coccolithophores make up the Isochrysidales and Coccolithales. Other groups include phytoplankton which produce the toxic algal blooms. == References == Category:Algae Category:Protista",
