 "text": "Colorimetric analysis is a method of determining the concentration of a chemical element or chemical compound in a solution with the aid of a color reagent. It is applicable to both organic compounds and inorganic compounds and may be used with or without an enzymatic stage. The method is widely used in medical laboratories and for industrial purposes, e.g. the analysis of water samples in connection with industrial water treatment. The equipment required is a colorimeter, some cuvettes and a suitable color reagent. The process may be automated, e.g. by the use of an AutoAnalyzer or by Flow injection analysis.
