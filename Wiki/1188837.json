 "text": "Orthosilicic acid is a chemical compound made of silicon, hydrogen, and oxygen. It has the chemical formula . It is the simplest silicic acid, a large class of polymeric chemicals with the general formula . Orthosilicic acid is believed to be the main form in which life absorbs silicon. == Preparation == Small silicic acids are very unstable and tend to polymerize to make larger ones. It is hard to make pure orthosilicic acid and not the larger silicic acids. Silicic acid exists as a reaction intermediate in the hydrolysis of sicilic acid esters and silicon halides like silicon tetrachloride. == Sources == Category:Silicon compounds Category:Oxyacids",
