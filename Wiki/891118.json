 "text": "Sebeos () was an Armenian historian and chronicler. He is well-known for the History of Heraclius, which contains information about Romanâ€“Persian Wars, the Muslim conquests as well as ancient Armenian legends such as Hayk. == Life and legacy == Little is known about the author's life. In 645, Sebeos attended Dvin's fourth council, and was among their signatories. His name is found on the eighth number in the list of eighteen bishops. Sebeos' work on Armenian history is honored in the country. He was the primary source of the fall of the Byzantine and Sasanian Empire and the Muslim conquests. The first Armenian writer to mention Sebeos is the 8th century priest Lewond. Author James Howard Johnston describes Sebeos as a 'non-biased' historian and places him along with other popular Armenian historians. His writings are valuable as one of the few intact surviving sources that chronicle sixth century Armenia and its surrounding territories. Sebeos' history was published for the first time in 1851 in Istanbul. == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:Armenian historians",
