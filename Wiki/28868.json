 "text": "The San Jose Earthquakes are an American soccer team that plays in Major League Soccer in San Jose, California. In December 2005, they moved to Houston, Texas to become the Houston Dynamo. Failure to secure funding for a new stadium caused the team to move. In July 2007, they were granted an expansion team, which would bring them back in 2008. From 1994 to 1999 they were known as the San Jose Clash. By agreement between MLS, the Dynamo, and the Earthquakes, the history of the original San Jose franchise belongs to the current Earthquakes. == Name == * 1994-1999 San Jose Clash * 1999-present San Jose Earthquakes == League title == * Major League Soccer : 2 ** 2001, 2003 == League position == Season League Position 1996 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 1997 Major League Soccer 5th / West 1998 Major League Soccer 5th / West 1999 Major League Soccer 5th / West 2000 Major League Soccer 4th / West 2001 Major League Soccer Champions 2002 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2003 Major League Soccer Champions 2004 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2005 Major League Soccer Quarterfinals 2008 Major League Soccer 7th / West ==References== Category:American soccer teams Category:Sports in San Jose, California Category:Major League Soccer teams Category:1994 establishments in California",
