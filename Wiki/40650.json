 "text": "Indirect democracy, or representative democracy, is when citizens elect representatives to make laws for them. This is what most modern countries have today. In a democracy the ultimate power to decide significant electoral system reforms lies with the people. The key question that democrats will tend to ask of any proposed change in electoral law or the voting mechanism is: “Will it actually increase the capacity of the electorate to get rid of unsatisfactory rulers and replace them with others?” Democrats regard that basic capacity as the best protection against bad government and the abuse of power. Systems of government which do not permit electors to change the government are not democratic, and usually are dictatorships or one-party states. The people have the ultimate power in a democracy to decide on substantial voting system improvements. The primary question that democrats will ask of every proposed change in election legislation or voting mechanism is, \"Will it genuinely strengthen the electorate's power to replace unhappy rulers with others?\" Democrats believe that fundamental capability is the strongest safeguard against bad governance and abuse of power. Government systems that do not allow electors to alter the government are not democratic and are generally dictatorships or one-party nations. == References == == Related pages == *Direct democracy == Other websites == * Electoral Reform Society Category:Democracy",
