 "text": "The Chimera (, Khimaira, from , khimaros, \"she-goat\") according to Greek mythology, was a fire-breathing monster that was composed of several different animals. The chimera is only one of several famous mythological hybrids. As with all mythical creatures, there is the question of its origin. In some traditions, the Chimera was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and sister of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. However, the chimera does not appear to have an existence in physical reality, save for the individual animals from which it is composed of. == Description == The most common description of the chimera comes from Homer's Iliad, in which the creature is said to have the head, and legs of a lion, the body of a goat, and tail of a snake. It is also believed to breathe fire and be female, despite the mane adorning the lions head. The chimera was said to be incredibly vicious and powerful, especially since as one single creature, it possessed the abilities of three separate animals. The Chimera was eventually killed by the hero Bellerophon. Category:Greek legendary creatures",
