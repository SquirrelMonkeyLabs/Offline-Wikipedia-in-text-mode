 "text": "Sanamahi Ahong Khong Chingba or Sanamahi Cheng Hongba is a religious grand chariot pulling festival dedicated to Lainingthou Sanamahi, a primordial deity of Sanamahism, mainly celebrated by the Meitei ethnicity. Its main venue is Imphal, the metropolis of Manipur. Notably, the festival was banned for three and a half consecutive centuries due to forcible Hindu advent in the society of the Meitei people, with the imperial powers of Pamheiba, the then King of Manipur. The ancient cultural practice was revived in the year 2018 AD with the strong efforts of the volunteers of Meitei ethnicity. ==References== Category:Meitei festivals",
