 "text": "The Chester Bridge is a bridge connecting Missouri's Route 51 with Illinois Route 150 across the Mississippi River between Perryville, Missouri and Chester, Illinois. It is the only motor-traffic bridge spanning the Mississippi River between St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri. ==History== The Chester Bridge is a two-lane traffic bridge. Construction began in 1941 and was finished in 1942 at a cost of $1.385 million (1942 dollars). The bridge was destroyed by a severe thunderstorm on July 29, 1944, and reconstructed 2 years later. The bridge serves about 6,400 vehicles per day. Inspections in 2020 showed the bridge to be in poor condition. The Missouri Department of Transportation plans to replace the bridge by 2028. ==References== Category:Bridges in the United States",
