 "text": "The Helix Bridge (before called the Double Helix Bridge) is a pedestrian bridge across the opening to Marina Bay in Singapore. It links the new Marina Centre with Marina South. It is located beside the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and the Bayfront Bridge, which are for vehicles (cars, etc.). It was first opened on 24 April 2010, but part of it stayed closed because of nearby construction. The whole bridge was opened on 18 July 2010. It was the last link in the pedestrian walkway that goes all the way around Marina Bay. The bridge is also used as an art gallery where children's paintings and drawings are shown to the public. The bridge was built as part of a major development plan in the area. Other projects included the huge modern-style Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, the Singapore Flyer, the Gardens by the Bay, and a business and financial zone. All of it was to be finished by 2012. ==Design and architecture== The team who designed the bridge included Australian and Singaporean architects.

Pairs of coloured letters (c and g, as well as a and t) on the bridge which are lit up in red and green. They represent cytosine, guanine, adenine and thymine, the four bases of DNA. The bridge has four viewing platforms that give views over the Singapore skyline and events happening within Marina Bay. The bridge is made of about 650 tonnes of stainless steel and 1000 tonnes of carbon steel. The construction of the bridge was done by two local engineering and construction companies. Type of bridge The Helix Bridge is a temporary Truss bridge. As you probably already know the Helix Bridge can only support living beings. The support is by triangle beams. The Helix Bridge has triangle beams because the triangle is the strongest shape for building and so they made triangle beams to support the bridge.
