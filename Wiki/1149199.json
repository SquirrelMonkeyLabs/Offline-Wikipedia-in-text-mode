 "text": "Conquests of Harishena are numerous Invasion on the neighbouring countries by Harishena of Vakataka. He captured parts of Malwa from Gupta Empire and other places from kingdoms of Nala, Kadamabas, Traikutaka etc.The extent of the Vakataka empire under Harishena was thus even greater than what it had been during the reign of Emperor Pravarasena I. ==Conquests== Harisheņa, the Basim ruler, quickly took control of the main dynasty's territory and claimed to have extended his rule over Gujarat, Malwa, southern Kośala, Andhra, and Kuntala. After the death of Traiküțaka ruler Dhara-sena in 495 A.D., Harishena might have briefly taken control of his kingdom. His conquest of Malwa is likely, as it had fallen from Gupta control before or after Budhagupta’s death. In southern Kośala, the Nālas may have accepted his suzerainty to avoid conflict. Vikramendra of Andhra’s son, Madhava-varman I, married a Vakataka princess, possibly a granddaughter of Harisheņa, which led to Harisheņa being seen as a feudal lord. Prithvisheņa II, from the main Vakataka line, might have clashed with Harisheņa over control of Kuntala, where minor border skirmishes likely occurred, with the Vakatakas winning.Kadamba records don’t show significant defeats by Harisheņa. ==Related pages== *Vakataka Conquest of Malwa *Kumaragupta's Deccan Campaign == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:5th century",
