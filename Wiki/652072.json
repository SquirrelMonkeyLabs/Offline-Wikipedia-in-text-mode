 "text": "The Ghats are two mountain ranges at the eastern and western edges of the Deccan Plateau in southern India. The Ghats are separated from the coasts of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal by fairly level coastal land. The Eastern Ghats are broken into several hill masses that are unlike each other and have a northeast-southwest trend along the Bay of Bengal. The Western Ghats are steep on the seaward side but gently sloping on the side of the Deccan plateau. ==Source== *Ghats; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Category:Mountain ranges of India",
