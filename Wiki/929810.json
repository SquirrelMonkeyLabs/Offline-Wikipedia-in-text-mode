She is also a former member of the Black Panther Party. Touré was the second black woman to work at the DC Rape Crisis Center, and she served as Director and General Administrator of the center. After working at the DC Rape Crisis Center for 13 years, Touré had an important role in anti-rape organizing and addressing all forms of violence toward women. Touré founded SisterSong, a national activist organization focusing on reproductive justice for women of color. She founded/co-founded other organizations, such as the National Black United Front and the International Council of African Women. Touré’s activism shaped black-feminist movements across America, allowing black feminists to gather together at political organizing, social gatherings, and consciousness-raising sessions to assert themselves. They produced leaders who supported feminism, civil rights, gay rights, and AID activism throughout the 1970s – 1990s. Touré continued to work with women with HIV, children born with HIV, and substance abusers. She has received numerous awards for her activism, spoken at rallies and conferences, and has published writing. == References == Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:American activists",
