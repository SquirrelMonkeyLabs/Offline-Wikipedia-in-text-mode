 "text": "A State of Trance (often abbreviated as ASOT) is the title of a radio show. It was hosted by popular trance DJ Armin van Buuren. It first aired in March 2001 on ID&T; Radio. In this weekly two-hours show he plays the latest tracks. His show is made more popular by publishing the artists and track titles on his website . This radio-show/website combination has proven popular internationally, as fans -- while listening to the radio-show -- will converse in the website chat-rooms and forums, such as DI.FM, over the playing tracks. When ID&T; Radio changed genres in 2004, Armin left and took A State of Trance with him. It is now a weekly feature on Fresh FM, a Dutch radio station, and DI.FM, an online radio station. An entire list of stations that broadcast ASOT can be found here, the ASOT section of Armins website . In June 2005, the 200th episode was celebrated in Amsterdam and aired on radio. == Other websites == * A State of Trance Radio * Fresh FM * DI.FM * Armin's website * Armin at Discogs * Armin at TheDJList.com A State of Trance",
