 "text": "On March 31, 1968, then-incumbent US President Lyndon B. Johnson made a surprise announcement during a televised address to the nation, announcing that he would not run for reelection for another term and was ending his campaign in the 1968 United States presidential election. Johnson said, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.\" Johnson's decision allowed Vice President Hubert Humphrey to become the Democratic Party's nominee. The 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, had significant protests and fights between demonstrators and police. Humphrey would go on to lose the election to former Vice President Richard Nixon. ==References== Category:1968 in the United States Category:Lyndon B. Johnson",
