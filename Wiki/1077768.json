 "text": "Karrik is a sans serif typeface created by French type designers Jean-Baptiste Morizot and Lucas Le Bihan. Published in 17 June 2020, it has two weights, Regular and Italic. It is available for download on Velvetyne Type Foundry's website. Created to look like early fonts in its style, it has unique features like uneven weight, no visual corrections, and unusual letter sizes. Its design started in March 2019 and was finished in October of the same year, getting inspiration from the Breton mythological figure Ankou, a symbol of death. Karrik comes in many file formats (OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF 2) and can be used for both graphic design andweb design, supporting a lot of European languages that use the Latin alphabet. It's an open source release, meaning anyone can use it for personal or business purposes. Whether for big text or small, it suits different needs. You can download Karrik from GitHub and other internet sources. == Related pages == * Open source *Typography *Sans serif *Font == Other websites == * Official website * SIL Open Font License 1.1 * Type specimen *Fonts In Use (Karrik) == References == Category:Fonts Category:Latin-script typefaces",
