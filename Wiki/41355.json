Side by side, they stick together, To uphold the Magpies name. See, the barrackers are shouting, As all barrackers should. Oh, the premiership's a cakewalk, For the good old Collingwood. ==References== ==Other websites== * Football Club website Category:Australian rules football clubs in Victoria",
