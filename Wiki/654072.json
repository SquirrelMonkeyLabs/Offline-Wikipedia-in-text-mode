 "text": "On July 18, 2018, Mollie Cecilia Tibbetts, an American college student, disappeared while jogging in Brooklyn, Iowa. A body matching her description was found in a cornfield on August 21 in Poweshiek County, Iowa, which was later identified as hers. According to police, her last confirmed communication was with her boyfriend of three years, Dalton Jack, who was out of town for work in Dubuque, Iowa, over away, shortly before leaving for her jog. The Iowa State Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy on the body and recorded the cause of death as \"multiple sharp force injuries\" and the manner as homicide. Mexican-born Cristhian Bahena Rivera faces first-degree murder charges. His lawful immigration status is disputed. Vice President Mike Pence called attention to the case at the beginning of a speech in Des Moines on August 15, telling a crowd of President Donald Trump's supporters that the government would continue to provide \"any and all federal support\" to the case. Pence later met with the Tibbetts family aboard Air Force Two. ==References== Category:2018 murders in the United States Tibbetts, Mollie Category:History of Iowa Category:July 2018 events Tibbetts, Mollie Tibbetts, Mollie Tibbetts, Mollie",
