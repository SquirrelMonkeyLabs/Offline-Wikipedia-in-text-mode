 "text": "Weevils are herbivorous beetles. They have a long 'snout' at the front of their head, called a rostrum. Weevils are a family, the Curculionidae, which may be the largest beetle family, with about 45,000+ named living species. That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom. In addition, the superfamily Curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil- type beetles. == Damaging pests == The family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans. The most famous weevil is the boll weevil, which ruins cotton crops. The Ips genus, feeding on Ponderosa pine, introduces a fungus to the tree. The fungus blocks resin canals, which leaves the weevil free to eat. Resin would normally wash the insects out; it is a defence mechanism. The fungus often kills the tree, and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires. In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires.David Grimaldi & Michael S. Engel 2005.

Bibcode:2020Geosc..10..358L. doi:10.3390/geosciences10090358 The maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais, is a major pest. It attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products, including wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed. == Families == * Anthribidae—fungus weevils * Attelabidae—leaf rolling weevils * Belidae—primitive weevils * Brentidae—straight snout weevils * Caridae * Curculionidae—true weevils * †Mesophyletidae * Nemonychidae—pine flower weevils * †?Obrieniidae == New species == Over 100 new species of weevil have been found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.Briggs, Helen 2019.
