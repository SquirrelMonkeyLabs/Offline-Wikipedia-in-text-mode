 "text": "The dainty green tree frog, dainty frog or graceful tree frog (Ranoidea gracilenta) is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in Queensland and New South Wales. This frog lives in forests. It sits on reeds and floating plants in bodies of water, but it also lives in places where people grow fruit. In the winter, it climbs up to the tops of trees and stays away from water. In warmer weather, the female frog lays eggs on stems of grass in the water. The tadpoles take 14 days to become frogs. The adult frog is 4.5 cm long. The dainty green tree frog is bright green with orange eyes, yellow feet, and yellow color on its sides. It is related to Ranoidea chloris. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
