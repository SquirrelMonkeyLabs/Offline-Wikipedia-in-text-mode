 "text": "National Geodetic Survey, formerly called the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (U.S.C.G.S.), is a United States federal agency that defines and manages a national coordinate system. It measures the land and then draws maps. It also measures magnetic fields and tides. Congress started it in 1807 to draw maps of the coasts. It helps transportation and communication; mapping and charting; and many science and engineering uses. Since 1970, it has been part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), of the United States Department of Commerce. ==References== ==Other websites== *National Geodetic Survey website **early history of the Coast Survey **NOAA Office of Coast Survey **U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Annual Reports, years 1837â€“1965 *Timeline at Arlington National Cemetery website *Explanation of survey monuments *1858 map: Preliminary chart of entrance to Brazos River hosted by the Portal to Texas History. *1853 map: Preliminary chart of San Luis Pass, Texas hosted by the Portal to Texas History. *1854 map: Preliminary survey of the entrance to the Rio Grande, Texas hosted by the Portal to Texas History.
