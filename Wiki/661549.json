 "text": "In the early afternoon of October 6, 2018, a limousine crashed at the New York state routes 30 and 30A north of Schoharie, west of Albany. The crash killed 20 people: the driver, all 17 passengers, and two pedestrians who were in a nearby parking lot. It is the worst transportation-related disaster in both the state and the nation since a plane crashed into a house outside Buffalo in 2009, killing 50. It is also the deadliest road transportation disaster in the U.S. since 2005. The passengers were a group of young adults who were on their way to celebrate one member's 30th birthday at a local winery. Among them were four sisters and two recently married couples. Investigation of the crash has revealed some safety issues with the limousine and driver. ==References== Category:2018 disasters Category:2018 in the United States Category:2010s in New York (state) Category:October 2018 events Category:Road accident deaths in New York (state) Category:Transport disasters in the United States",
