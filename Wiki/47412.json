They play their home games at the American Airlines Center. The team's main owners are casino magnates Miriam Adelson and her son-in-law Patrick Dumont, who bought a majority stake in the team from Mark Cuban in December 2023. Cuban still has a minority interest and controls basketball operations. Though they have had good teams for most of the 2000s, they have only made the NBA Finals three times. The first time was in 2006, where they lost to the Miami Heat 4-2. They won their first NBA Championship in 2011 when they beat the Miami Heat in a 4-2 series in a rematch from 2006. After the championship, the Mavericks would not make it past the first/second rounds until 2022. They played the Boston Celtics in the 2024 Finals losing in five games. Notable Mavericks players include Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Peja Stojaković, Jason Terry, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler, Brendan Haywood, Caron Butler, Derek Harper, Rolando Blackman, Luka Dončić, and Kyrie Irving. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:National Basketball Association teams Mavericks Category:1980 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Texas",
