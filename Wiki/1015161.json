 "text": "Manchester tart is a traditional English baked tart with a shortcrust pastry shell, spread with raspberry jam, covered with a custard filling and topped with flakes of coconut and a Maraschino cherry. Some have thinly-sliced bananas under the custard. Manchester tart was often on school dinner menus until the mid-1980s. Robinson's Bakers of Failsworth says it is the home of the Manchester tart. ==References== Category:Cakes Category:British food",
