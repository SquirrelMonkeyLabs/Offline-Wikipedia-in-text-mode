In August 2003, the Financial Times (FT) published an article using quotes from Patel talking about the \"racist attitudes\" in the Conservative Party, and that \"there's a lot of bigotry around\". Patel later said she meant these words in terms of her being blocked as a party candidate because of her ethnicity. ==Political career== In the 2005 UK general election, Patel ran as the Conservative candidate for Nottingham North, losing to the incumbent Labour MP Graham Allen.

After the election, Patel became Minister of State for Employment in the Department for Work and Pensions. After Prime Minister David Cameron's announcement of a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the European Union (EU), Patel was see as the \"poster girl\" for the Vote Leave campaign.

After Cameron resigned following the referendum, Patel supported Theresa May as his replacement. ===Secretary of State for International Development=== After becoming Prime Minister in July 2016, May promoted Patel as Secretary of State for International Development. Some people at the department were worried about Patel's appointment, because of her support for Brexit. Patel said that too much UK aid was wasted or spent inappropriately. During her time at the department, she approved £1.1 billion in global aid to be used to fight malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. On 3 November 2017, it was revealed that Patel had held meetings in Israel in August 2017 without telling the Foreign Office.

She was accused of bullying people who worked for her. Rutnam resigned on 29 February. Rutnam alleged that Patel had orchestrated a \"vicious\" campaign against him. In November 2020, an investigation found evidence that Patel had broken the ministerial code after being accused of bullying in the three government departments in which she had worked under. Patel said that she had \"never set out to upset anyone\" and that she was \"absolutely sorry for anyone that I have upset\". She reached a legal settlement with Rutnam in March 2021. In August 2020, Patel said that many migrants were seeking to cross the English Channel to Britain because they believed that France was a \"racist country\" where they may be \"tortured\". In September 2020, Patel said that Ascension Island, which is more than from the UK, could be used to build an asylum processing centre. ===2024 Conservative leadership election=== In the 2024 general election, Patel was re-elected as MP for Witham. She received 18,827 votes - a majority of 5,145. After the resignation of Rishi Sunak as leader of the Conservative Party, she was seen as a likely candidate in the leadership election.
