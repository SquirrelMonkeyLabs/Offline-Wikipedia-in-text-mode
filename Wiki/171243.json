 "text": "A millisecond (sometimes shortened to 'ms') is one thousandth of a second. This page lists times between 10−3 seconds and 10−2 seconds (1 millisecond to 10 milliseconds). One millisecond contains 1000 microseconds. There are 1000 milliseconds in one second. * 1 millisecond – the time it takes for a normal flash in a camera to finish. * 1 millisecond – time taken for sound to travel 34 cm * 1.000692286 milliseconds – time taken for light to travel 300 km in a vacuum * 2 milliseconds – half life of hassium-265 * 3 milliseconds – a housefly’s wing flap * 3.4 milliseconds – half life of meitnerium-266 * 5 milliseconds – a honeybee’s wing flap * 8 milliseconds – 1/125 of a second (125), a camera shutter speed * 9 milliseconds – normal seek time for a 7200rpm hard disk * 33.3 milliseconds - the amount of time one frame lasts in 30fps video * 30 to 100 milliseconds - normal latency for a broadband internet connection * 100 milliseconds - the reaction speed of a human * 102 milliseconds - half-life of bohrium-262 * 134 milliseconds - the amount of time it takes by light to travel around the earth's equator * 200 to 670 milliseconds - the tempo of modern dance music (128 - 150 BPM) * 300 to 400 milliseconds - the blink of a human eye * 838 milliseconds - half-life of lithium-8 The basic interval, in time manners, in most of the programming languages is 1 millisecond . e.g. the command delay() in C++. Others use second interval. Category:Units of time Category:Orders of magnitude",
