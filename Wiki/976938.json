 "text": "The Dragon (simplified Chinese: 龙, traditional Chinese: 龍) is the fifth part of the 12-year cycle of animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac in relation to the Chinese calendar. It is the only zodiac sign represented by a mythical creature, rather than a real-life animal. The Year of the Dragon is associated with the Earthly Branch symbol 辰, pronounced chen. It has been suggested by an academic researcher that the Earth Branch character may be related to scorpions; it may symbolize the star Antares. In the Buddhist calendar used in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, the Dragon is replaced by the nāga. In the Gurung zodiac, the Dragon is replaced by the eagle. ==Year and the Five Elements== People born within these dates can be said to be born in the \"Year of the Dragon\", while carrying the following elemental sign.
