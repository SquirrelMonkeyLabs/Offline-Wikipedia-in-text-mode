 "text": "The Treaty of Paris, often called the Peace of Paris, or the Treaty of 1763, was signed on 10 February 1763, by the Kingdoms of Great Britain, France and Spain, with Portugal in agreement. It ended the Seven Years' War, which is known as the French and Indian War in North America. The British won the war against France and Spain. The treaty gave control of the northern part of North America in what is now Canada to Britain. France was left with only two small islands, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, for its cod fishery. The treaty started an era of British power outside Europe. The treaty did not include either Prussia or Austria, which signed the separate Treaty of Hubertusburg five days later. ==References== Paris 1763 Category:1763 Category:18th century in Europe Category:Seven Years' War Category:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Category:History of Paris Category:1760s works",
