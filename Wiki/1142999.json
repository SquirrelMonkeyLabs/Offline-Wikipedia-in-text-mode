 "text": "The New York Equal Protection of Law Amendment is a proposed change to the New York Constitution. People in New York State will vote on the amendment on November 5, 2024. The amendment would constitutionally protect the right to abortion in New York. It does this by adding additional categories of protections to the constitution's Equal Protection Clause including \"ethnicity, national origin, age, and disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, reproductive healthcare, and autonomy\". Any future attempts to ban abortion in the sate would then be recognized as unfair discrimination because it would treat one type of reproductive healthcare differently from other kinds of healthcare. == References == Category:United States law Category:2024 elections in the United States",
