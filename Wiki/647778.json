 "text": "Stepney is a district of London, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The modern district grew out of a medieval village around St Dunstan's church and the 15th century Mile End Road. The area built up rapidly in the 19th century. It was mainly for immigrant workers and displaced poor people. It had a reputation for poverty, overcrowding, violence and political dissent.Christopher Hibbert & Ben Weinreb 2000 It was severely damaged during the Blitz in World War II. Over one third of the housing was totally destroyed. In the 1960s, slum clearance and development replaced most old residential streets with tower blocks and modern housing estates. Some Georgian architecture and Victorian era terraced housing survive. Examples include Arbour Square, the eastern side of Stepney Green, and the streets around Matlock Street. ==References== Category:Areas of London Category:London Borough of Tower Hamlets",
