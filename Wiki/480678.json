Movie critic Roger Ebert stated: \"Half Past Dead is like an alarm that goes off with nobody in the room. It does its job, stops, and nobody cares.\" Seagal was nominated a Razzie Award in the category of Worst Actor at the 2003 Golden Raspberry Awards but lost to Roberto Benigni in Pinocchio. == Plot == FBI agent Sasha Petrosevitch goes undercover as a Russian car thief and infiltrates the crime world to seek revenge on Sonny Eckvall, who he believes killed his wife. After a botched operation, Sasha and criminal Nick Frazier are sent to the newly reopened Alcatraz prison, where a terrorist group led by Donny Johnson takes control, seeking a hidden stash of gold from the first prisoner scheduled for execution. With the help of inmates, Sasha rescues the hostage and ultimately leads the authorities to the goldâ€™s location, while Nick is released early for his role in the crisis. == Cast == * Steven Seagal as Sasha Petrosevitch * Morris Chestnut as 49er One / Donald Robert Johnson * Ja Rule as Nicolas \"Nick\" Frazier * Nia Peeples as 49er Six * Tony Plana as Warden Juan Ruiz \"El Fuego\" Escarzaga * Kurupt as Twitch * Michael \"Bear\" Talliferro as Little Joe * Claudia Christian as Special Agent Ellen \"E.
