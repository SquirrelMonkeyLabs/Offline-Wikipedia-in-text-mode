 "text": "Roy Carr-Hill (1943 - 2022) was a professor at the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York from 1983 when it started. He was born in Widnes. He first worked in criminology and penology. He stayed at York until he retired in 2011 and still worked there after that. He is most well known for the Carr- Hill formula, which sets most of the pay for general practitioners in the United Kingdom. It includes individual patients' age, gender and health conditions and calculates a \"weighted\" count of patients according to need. This gives more money where it is most needed and takes some away from richer areas He did a lot of work in the field of inequality and poverty, both in the UK and in low- and middle-income countries. In Africa he did a lot of work on education. He was an active member of the Radical Statistics Group. == References == Category:British statisticians Category:1943 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Academics of the University of York",
