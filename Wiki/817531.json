 "text": "The Marlovian theory says that Christopher Marlowe wrote most of William Shakespeareâ€™s poems and plays. The theory also says Marlowe did not die in Deptford on 30 May 1593. It says his death was faked. Like Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe was an Elizabethan poet and playwright. They were both born in 1564. Marlovian theory began in the 1800s. The idea is that the Church of England wanted to punish Marlowe for being an atheist, so _Queen_ Elizabeth's government helped him fake his death, leave the country and continue writing plays under Shakespeare's name. The play Lust's Dominion was attributed to Marlowe when it was published in 1657. The play borrows from a 1599 pamphlet about the death of King Philip II of Spain in 1598. Marlowe died in 1593. The attribution has been recognized as spurious (wrong) by critics and scholars for nearly two centuries. == References == Category:Theater Category:William Shakespeare Category:Controversies",
