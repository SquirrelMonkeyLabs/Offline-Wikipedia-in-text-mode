 "text": "Spacewar! is one of the first known video games. It was released in 1962. It was made by Steve Russell and others. In this game, the player has to shoot the other spaceships while flying around a star. The spaceships shoot missiles (rockets) which were unaffected (nothing happened) by the gravity. Each spaceship had only a few missiles and only a little bit of fuel. The hyperspace could be used to avoid being hit by a missile but the spaceship would reappear at a random place. The more the player used hyperspace, the bigger the chance that the spaceship would explode.
