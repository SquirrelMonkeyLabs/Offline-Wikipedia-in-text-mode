He joined the city council of Waddinxveen. He became alderman from 1973. He was responsible for Education and Sports Affairs. For the 1982 council elections he participated as party leader. Advertisements were even made with the help of an advertising plane with a slogan to vote Anne van Gent. A day after the elections it was announced he was appointed mayor of Zevenhuizen. He stopped as an alderman, but it became a national news item that Van Gent, combined his position as a councilor in Waddinxveen with the mayorship in Zevenhuizen until September of that year. Nowadays that wouldn’t be allowed. In 1991 Zevenhuizen merged with the municipality of Moerkapelle. After nine years this ended his mayorship. He moved back to Waddinxveen. In 2019 he moved to Gouda. He died in his sleep in Gouda in October 2022, aged 96. ==References== ==Other websites== *some newspaper articles of Van Gent — via Delpher Category:1926 births Category:2022 deaths Category:Aldermen of the Netherlands Category:Dutch councillors Category:Dutch mayors Category:Labour Party (Netherlands) politicians",
