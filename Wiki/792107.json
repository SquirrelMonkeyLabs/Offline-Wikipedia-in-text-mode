 "text": "Fishkeeping is a popular hobby, done by aquarists. It is concerned with keeping fish in a home aquarium or garden pond. Fish have been raised as food in pools and ponds for thousands of years. == Types of fishkeeping == Fishkeeping can be divided into three disciplines, depending on the type of water the fish came from. They are freshwater, brackish, and saltwater fishkeeping. ===Freshwater fishkeeping=== Freshwater fishkeeping is the most popular type of fishkeeping. Small pet stores often sell many types of freshwater fish such as goldfish, guppies, and angelfish. Many fishkeepers create freshwater aquascapes where there are lots of aquatic plants as well as fish. ===Saltwater fishkeeping=== Marine aquaria is a type of fishkeeping that is not very popular. This is because saltwater fish have more specific needs to keep them alive. Saltwater fish is also expensive. Many types of saltwater fish are kept in saltwater fishkeeping. ===Brackish water fishkeeping=== Brackish water aquaria is a type of fishkeeping. The salinity in a brackish- water aquarium must stay between the salinity of freshwater and seawater. Many types of fish prefer brackish water including some types of mollies, many types of gobies, some types of pufferfish, monos, and scats. Category:Hobbies Category:Fish",
