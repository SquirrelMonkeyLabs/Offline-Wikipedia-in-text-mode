 "text": "A sonic boom is created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound. When an airplane reaches the speed of sound, it makes a bang sound or an explosive noise. This is often called \"breaking the sound barrier.\" The visible part of a sonic boom is actually air that becomes squashed by sound waves, which is known as a vapor cone. The thunder you hear when lightning strikes near enough, is also a sonic boom, caused by the lightning moving faster than the speed of sound, and making a sonic boom. The first plane to fly at a level altitude above the speed of sound was the Bell X-1 in 1947 and was piloted by Chuck Yeager. == References == Category:Sound Category:Aviation",
