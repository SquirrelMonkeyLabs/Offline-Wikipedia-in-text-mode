 "text": "The McLafferty rearrangement is an organic reaction seen in mass spectrometry. A mass spectrometer breaks apart the molecule being studied. The molecule breaks apart in consistent ways that chemists can predict. Most of the time, a carbon-carbon bond breaks and the atoms do not jump across the break between the fragments. The McLafferty rearrangement is an example of a hydrogen atom jumping to the other fragment as a part of the process of the bond breaking. It happens in an organic molecule containing a keto-group. == The reaction == The American chemist Fred McLafferty was the first to describe the reaction in 1959. : The keto-group undergoes β-cleavage, with the gain of the γ-hydrogen atom. This rearrangement may take place by a radical or ionic mechanism. ==Related pages== *α-cleavage ==References== ==Further reading== * ==Other websites== * Fred McLafferty Faculty Webpage at Cornell University Category:Mass spectrometry Category:Rearrangement reactions",
