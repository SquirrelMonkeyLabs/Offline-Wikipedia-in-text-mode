 "text": "The Queen Anne Victorian style is one of the styles of Victorian architecture. Particularly in North America, although occasionally in Australia, the Queen Anne Victorian style has features like fishscale trimwork and ornate spindles on the porches, brick and or clapboard siding (often painted in unorthodox colors) and turrets or bay windows. Houses built in this style tend to have two - four floors. Queen Anne is a misnomer when it comes to Victorian architecture because the Victorian era was several centuries removed from the reign of the real Queen Anne. Category:Architectural styles",
