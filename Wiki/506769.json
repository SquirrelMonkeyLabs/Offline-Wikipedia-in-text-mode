Sanders caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, and he has confirmed that he is running as a Democrat. On July 26, 2016, Sanders lost the nomination to Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. ==Background== Sanders' political successes have been in rural Vermont. Sanders has been involved in political activism nearly his entire adult life. While in college he protested against police brutality, led a weeks long sit-in against housing segregation, and worked as an organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality.Frizell, Sam (May 26, 2015) \"The Radical Education of Bernie Sanders\" In 1963 he traveled to Washington to attend the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

Saying, \"The right has claimed the mantle of 'family values' for far too long. When my Republican colleagues use the term they’re usually talking about things like opposition to contraception, denying a woman’s right to choose, opposition to gay rights, and support for abstinence-only education,\" Sanders advocates what he calls \"real family values\" which include paid sick time, paid vacations, and access to paid family leave. Speaking on woman's pro-choice issues, he commented that \"[Republicans believe] that [a woman] cannot control her own body. I disagree. Let's say it loud and clear: Women control their own bodies – not the government.\" Sanders has used social media to help his campaign gain momentum. Along with posting content on Twitter and Facebook, he held an \"Ask Me Anything\" on Reddit on May 19, 2015. \"I am Senator Bernie Sanders, Democratic candidate for President of the United States — AMA\". - \"Reddit#IAmA\".

The Sanders campaign criticized the move as an excessive reaction stemming from the inappropriate actions of a single staffer and threatened possible legal action unless the Democratic National Committee restores its access. The Sanders campaign claims it warned the DNC about glitches in the voter file program months ago. On December 18, 2015, the campaign filed a lawsuit, stating the Committee had unfairly suspended its access. Former Obama Advisor David Axelrod contended on Twitter that the DNC was \"putting finger on the scale\" for Hillary. The DNC and the Sanders campaign struck a deal the same day that restored the campaign's access to voter data. ==Advertising== Just before the early primaries in 2016, Sanders published an advertisement called \"America\". It was first shown on January 21, on YouTube. It was set to be shown on television in Iowa and New Hampshire shortly before the Democratic Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. The advertisement features \"America\", a song by Simon & Garfunkel from their album Bookends (1968). ==Fundraising== Sanders raised over $1.5 million in the first 24 hours after he announced his presidential campaign on April 30, 2015.
