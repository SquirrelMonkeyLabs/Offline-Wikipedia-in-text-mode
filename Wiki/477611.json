He is one of the earliest industrialists of India. IISc is well known as India's finest research university.Ramachandra Guha, India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy (London: Pan Books; Macmillan Distribution (MDL), 2008), p. 697 ==History== In 1893, Jamshetji Tata had a chance meeting with Swami Vivekananda on a ship from Japan to Chicago. Then, Jamshetji Tata discussed his plan with Vivekananda to bring Iron and Steel industry to India. Five years later, Tata wrote a letter to Vivekananda about his desire to establish a research institution. He also asked Vivekananda for guidance in this matter. Vivekananda softly declined this proposal. The government of Mysore donated (371 acres or 1.50 sq km) to build the institute.Southern India: Its History, People, Commerce, and Industrial Resources, ed.
