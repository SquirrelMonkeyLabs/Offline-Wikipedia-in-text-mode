 "text": "The salty rocket frog or forest rocket frog (Aromobates saltuensis) is a frog. It lives in Venezuela. Scientists think it could also live in Colombia. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. The adult frogs live in grassy places with streams in them and in forests that have never been cut down and forests that are growing back. Scientists saw the frog between 482 and 1500 meters above sea level. Scientists have seen the frog in Parque Nacional El Tam√°. ==Reproduction== The female frog lays eggs on land. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frogs live to make farms, to make other things that people need, get wood to build with, and raise animals. Bad chemicals in the water can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
