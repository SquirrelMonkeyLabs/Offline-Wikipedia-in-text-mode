 "text": "Misophonia (meaning \"hatred of sound\") is a disorder where certain normal sounds, and sometimes visual motions associated with those sounds, can cause someone to experience an unusually strong and uncomfortable mental and physical reaction. The sounds could be as simple as someone chewing food or gum loudly or with their mouth open. Other examples include a ballpoint pen clicking (repeatedly), tapping, typing and other common sounds. The disorder has only been identified and named in the last 20 years. According to one sufferer, \"It’s like a fight-or-flight response: Your muscles get tense, you’re on edge, your heart races, and you feel the urge to flee.\" Misophonia is often misdiagnosed as one of several psychological disorders. People who experience misophonia often isolate themselves to keep away from trigger sounds. There is no cure yet, but there are potential treatments to help sufferers cope. People with misophonia have different amounts of tolerance for triggering sounds, with some people experiencing a major impact on their abilities to do normal activities like schooling, employment, and family relationships. Many also have severe trouble focusing on tasks while exposed to triggering sounds. The cause of misophonia is not yet known. Some studies say that it affects more than 5% of the population. It can appear with other disorders such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and others. == Symptoms of Misophonia == * Repulsion to Specific Sounds * Emotional Response * Physical Response * Avoidance == References == Category:Mental illnesses",
