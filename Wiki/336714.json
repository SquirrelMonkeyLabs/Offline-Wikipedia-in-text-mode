I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out.\" Michele added, \"What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be.\" Rachel is a \"strong, driven girl\" but somewhat nervous about herself.

She had to go home to get her bridesmaid dress. While Quinn is driving back to New York City, her car is hit by a truck. == Development == === Casting and creation === Rachel is portrayed by Lea Michele. Younger Rachel has been played by Lauren Boles. When Ryan Murphy was casting for Glee, he wanted actors who could take on theatrical roles. Murphy did not want to do network casting calls. He instead, spent three months on Broadway. He found Michele, who was starring in Spring Awakening. The role of Rachel was written just for Michele. In an interview with The Washington Post, Michele commented on her casting, saying: \"I was kind of just thrown into this—this is one of the first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoing—she performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience.\" In December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of Glee would be replaced. He stated that the replacements would happen at the end of the third season. Which would be around the time when they graduate. Murphy said: \"Every year we're going to add a new group [of people]. There's nothing more sad than a high schooler with a bald spot.\" He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: \"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\" Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving. Michele commented on this, saying: \"We always knew we'd graduate in real time. It's all part of the plan and it's all good! It's going to make Season 3 amazing! This is just the beginning!\" However, Falchuk later stated that Michele, along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith will graduate at the end of the third season. He also said: \"because they're (they are) graduating doesn't mean they're (they are) leaving the show.\" Falchuk also said: \"it was never our plan or our intention to let them go…. They are not done with the show after this season.\" Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly commented on the news about the cast leaving. She said: \"Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on Friday Night Lights, which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, but it was a well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood (group) didn't (did not) try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished (have done successfully): a seamless, realistic (real) transition (change). The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glees strong points, which is not to say they couldn't (could not) be. But the question is: Is Glee looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights… or Saved By the Bell: The New Class?\" === Characterization === Michele took the role as Rachel because of her characterization. Michele explained: \"Not only is she a singer, but she has so much heart—I think it's what we need on TV. A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are.\" Michele described the first thirteen episodes of Glee. She described it as: \"Rachel's journey of finding herself within the glee club\". She also said that \"she's learning how to be a team player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's (who is) sometimes a little misunderstood.\" Glees costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costumes. Eyrich told Entertainment Weekly: \"Originally (at first), the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down (someone who is serious in the job they are doing), preppy (someone who looks like a high school student), obnoxious (not very well liked by people), squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen (television) and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls find a way to make it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong.\" Michele have stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She also gets inspiration from the movie Election, and Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf. She has explained: \"[Blair] is shady (a mean person), but you still love her. She's still vulnerable (easy to get hurt). That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't (does not) matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't (will not) matter anyway.\" == Reception == === Critical reviews === Some songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They were also on the soundtrack albums, Glee: The Music, Volume 1 and Glee: The Music, Volume 2. Rachel has received positive reviews from critics. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\" in 2010. She also was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for \"Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy\" in 2010. Robert A. George of the New York Post stated \"the only female [in Glee] who doesn't (does not) come across as manipulative (easy to tell someone what to do) or vapidly (nothing good about her) helpless\" (not able to help her own self). Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan wrote, \"Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled (get's whatever she wants in life) diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype.\" Denise Martin of The Los Angeles Times commented in her review of the episode \"The Rhodes Not Taken\": \"if there's any justice in the world, Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel\". In the episode \"Hairography\", Kurt Hummel gives Rachel a bad make over. Mike Hale of the New York Times remembered a popular theme that critics give negative reviews because of the way Glee treats its female characters. Hale said that he understands why, but also says that the show equally treats male characters the same. However, he wrote that \"it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic (really good).\" Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh commented: \"when we saw Rachel fall for them (Finn and Puck), she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A (best), uber-talented, self- involved (gets into things by herself) know-it-all (a person who believes they know everything) who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose (to show) a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships.\" === Awards and nominations === Michele has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Rachel. Michele won the Satellite Awards for \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical or Comedy Television Series\" in 2009. She also won, as part of the cast, for \"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\" at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.
