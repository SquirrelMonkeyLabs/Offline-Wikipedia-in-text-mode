 "text": "A Staffordshire oatcake is a kind of savoury pancake made from oatmeal, flour and yeast. It is cooked on a large hot plate, usually in a special oatcake shop. It is a local food in Stoke on Trent and not often found anywhere else. They are called Staffordshire oatcakes by other people, because they are made in and around Staffordshire. In Stoke they are simply called \"oatcakes\". They are heated up and often served with tinned tomato, melted cheese and bacon. There are also Derbyshire oatcakes. They are usually larger and thicker and eaten flat. Staffordshire oatcakes are usually folded or rolled up. Lancashire and Yorkshire oatcakes (also called havercakes) are similar to the Derbyshire ones, but they are now rare. Scottish oatcakes are more like a biscuit or cookie. ==References== Category:Baked foods Category:Stoke-on-Trent",
