 "text": "Tacit programming (or point-free programming) is the style of programming functions where the parameter is not mentioned. Instead, the functions are defined using combinators and higher-level abstractions like map (which applies a function to each element of a list). It is commonly used in functional programming languages like Haskell. ==Related pages== * Anonymous function * Function (mathematics) * Lambda calculus * Combinatory logic == References == Category:Computer programming Category:Functions and mappings",
