This frog lives in trees that grow where thereis limestone in the ground. Scientists believe this frog lays eggs in pitcher plants but they are not sure. Scientists say this frog is in a small amount of danger of dying out, but only small because one of the places it lives is a protected park, where human beings do not cut down the forest. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
