 "text": "The fibula is one of the two bones which make up the lower leg (humans), or back leg in tetrapods. The other one is the tibia. Above them is the knee and femur; below are the feet. Muscles are attached to the top of the fibula which help move the knee. It is also used to support the knee and the tibia. ==Structure== The bone has the following components: * Lateral malleolus * Interosseous membraneconnecting the fibula to the tibia, forming a syndesmosis joint * The superior tibiofibular articulation is an arthrodial joint between the lateral condyle of tibia of the tibia and the head of the fibula. * The inferior tibiofibular articulation (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the medial side of the lower end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the lateral side of the tibia. ==References== Category:Bones",
