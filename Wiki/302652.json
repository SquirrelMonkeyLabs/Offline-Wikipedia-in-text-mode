The Wallace Line is a key term in biogeography. It passes between Bali and Lombok, which are separated by a passage of water which is both deep and fast. On the one side are Australasian species, and on the other side Asian species. The natural history of the area was investigated by Alfred Russel Wallace, who spent eight years in the Spice Islands.Wallace A.R. 1869. The Malay Archpelago. Macmillan, London.Wallace A.R. 1876.

I believe the western part to be a separated portion of continental Asia, while the eastern is a fragmentary prolongation of a former west Pacific continent\". == References == Category:Australasia Category:Islands of Indonesia Category:Geography of Malaysia Category:Islands of the Philippines Category:Melanesia Category:Archipelagos",
