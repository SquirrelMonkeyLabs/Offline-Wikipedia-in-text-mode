 "text": "After the crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and the passage of the national security law in 2020 many people left Hong Kong and moved to the United Kingdom. More than 144,000 Hongkongers moved to the UK in 2021 and 2022 using British National (Overseas) visas. They are described as a highly skilled workforce eager to integrate. Unlike earlier immigrants from China they have been educated in the English language and have money. Most of them are in their 30s and 40s with children. The “main priority for Hongkongers is good schools for their children”. Many have moved to Trafford, Warrington and Solihull - suburbs which have not had many immigrants in the past. Fewer moved to London than in earlier years. ==References== Category:Hong Kong Category:Immigration Category:United Kingdom",
