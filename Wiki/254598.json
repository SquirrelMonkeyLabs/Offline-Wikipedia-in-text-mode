The driver, Anna Gallagher, 28, and her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, were both killed instantly. He was vacationing with Jennifer Grey, whom he had begun dating in semi-secrecy during the filming of Ferris Bueller's Day Off; the crash publicly revealed their relationship. He suffered a fractured leg and ribs, a concussion, and a collapsed lung. Grey's injuries included severe whiplash, which later required surgery to avoid paralysis. Broderick denied knowledge of the car crash. He was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and potentially faced five years in prison, yet received a lesser charge of careless driving. Political beliefs Broderick is a liberal. == References == ==Other websites== * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Manhattan Category:American movie actors Category:American stage actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:Jewish American actors Category:Tony Award winning actors",
