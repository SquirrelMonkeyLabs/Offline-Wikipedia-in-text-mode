 "text": "Ranoidea serrata (also known as the green-eyed tree frog) is a tree frog from Australia. The adult male frog is 3.7 to 5.4 cm long and the adult female is 5.8 to 8.0 cm long. This frog can be green, brown, orange or tan in color, and it often has a pattern on its back so it can look like moss or lichen to hide from larger animals that want to eat it. Scientists used to think this frog was the same species as Ranoidea genimaculata, which is also called \"green- eyed tree frog.\" They also thought it was the same as Ranoidea eucnemis and Ranoidea myola. Ranoidea serrata is larger than these other frogs and the male frogs' voices sound different. It also has a larger flap of skin next to its limbs. This skin is scalloped like a serrated knife. That is why its Latin name is serrata. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
