 "text": "The Bakassi Peninsula is a small piece of land located on the Gulf of Guinea, which has caused conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon for many years. In 2002, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) decided that Cameroon should have control over the peninsula, which made some Nigerian residents unhappy. This led to fighting between the two countries, and Nigeria even threatened to use military force in 2013. The situation became more complicated when Bakassi was given to Cameroon, because many Nigerians did not have the right documents to prove their identity. Since Bakassi was given to Cameroon, the government has been accused of treating local Nigerians badly. Many Nigerians have had to leave the peninsula for safety reasons, and some have become stateless because they do not have the right documents to prove who they are. While most groups that wanted independence have stopped fighting, some people in Bakassi are still unhappy with how things are going. There are still tensions between Nigeria and Cameroon, and it is unclear how the conflict will be resolved. In conclusion, the situation in Bakassi is complicated and has caused a lot of problems for people living in the area. The conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon is still ongoing, and the situation is not clear. While some groups have stopped fighting, there are still people who are unhappy with how things are going, and tensions remain high. Category:Politics of Nigeria Category:Politics of Cameroon",
