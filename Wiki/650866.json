Later, he helped publish a magazine called Indonesia Merdeka (which means Free Indonesia). When he returned to Indonesia, the Japanese invaded. He hope that they would support Indonesian independence and collaborated with them. However, he was disappointed when it became clear that they too wanted to colonize Indonesia. After the Japanese left, he joined Sukarno in declaring independence. He was Indonesia's first Vice President while Sukarno was president. Hatta died on 14 March 1980 in Jakarta and was buried in Jakarta's Tanah Kusir public cemetery. ==Awards== *Order of the Sacred Treasure (1943) *Bintang Gerilya (1952) *Honorary doctoral Indonesia University \"UI\" (1958) ==References== Category:1902 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Vice presidents of Indonesia Category:Prime ministers",
