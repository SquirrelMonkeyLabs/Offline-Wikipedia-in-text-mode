As part of his plea bargain, an additional conviction was added, bringing the total number of convictions to 49, making him the most prolific serial killer in United States history according to confirmed murders. He was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. Ridgway murdered many women and girls in the state of Washington during the 1980s and 1990s. He would mainly kill runaways or prostitutes and would strangle his victims. On November 30, 2001, as Ridgway was leaving the Kenworth truck factory where he worked in Renton, Washington, he was arrested for the murders of four women whose cases were linked to him through DNA evidence. ==References== ==Other websites== *A copy of Ridgway's infamous letter to the press (PDF) Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:People from Seattle Category:People from Salt Lake City, Utah",
