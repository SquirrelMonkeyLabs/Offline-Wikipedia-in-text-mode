 "text": "Dvergar or Norse dwarves (Old Norse dvergar, singular dvergr) are creatures in Norse mythology. They are associated with rocks, the earth, craft and metal work, wisdom, and greed. The dwarves came from maggots that formed on Ymir's skin as he was killed by Odin, VÃ© and Vili. Odin transformed the maggots into dwarves. It is said that dwarves are blacksmiths and built weapons for war between the gods. Some say that dwarves and elves are the same thing. Four of them are named Nordri, Soudri, Austri, and Vestri. They hold of the skull of Ymir, the sky and mean North, South, East, and West. ==Related pages== *Dwarf (mythology) Category:Norse mythology",
