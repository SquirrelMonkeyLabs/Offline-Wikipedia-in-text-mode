Cole, Ivan Cornejo and Karol G. ==History== The label was founded by Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field. It was made as a joint venture with Atlantic Records. One of the main features of the company was weak control over the musicians. This allowed them to freely implement their ideas in creativity. Already in 1993, a year after its founding, the label's profits recouped the $20 million invested in its opening. Until May 2014, the CEO of the company was Iovine, after which he was replaced by John Yanick. In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive distribution rights for the releases of hip-hop-specialized label Death Row Records, whose artists included Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Later, due to the distribution of the gangsta rap albums by the company, the label was embroiled in great conflict with members of the public. As a result, in 1995 Time Warner, owner of Universal Music Group, severed ties with Interscope, selling 50% of the shares to Field and Iovine for $115 million. In 1996, 50% of the shares were bought for $ 200 million by MCA Music Entertainment Group, later known as Universal Music Group. ==References== ==Related pages== * List of Interscope Records artists ==Other websites== * Interview with Mark Williams, A&R; at Interscope Records Category:American record labels Category:1990 establishments in California Category:Companies based in Santa Monica, California",
