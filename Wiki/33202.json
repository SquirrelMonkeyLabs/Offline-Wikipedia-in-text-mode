 "text": "Holy Roman Emperor was the title that was given to the ruler of a loose group of places in mostly Central Europe called the Holy Roman Empire. The title of \"emperor\" was passed from the Romans to the Frankish kingdom (for which \"France\" is named) when, on 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne, king of the Franks, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. ==List of emperors== This list includes all emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, whether or not they called themselves Holy Roman Emperor. There are some gaps. For example, Henry the Fowler was King of Germany but not Emperor. ===Emperors before Otto the Great=== Some historians say the Carolingian Empire was the start of the Holy Roman Empire. Others say the start of the Holy Roman Empire was 962.
