 "text": "Wentworth Earl Miller III (born June 2, 1972) is an American actor, model, screenwriter and producer. He is best known for his role as Michael Scofield in the Fox television series Prison Break (2005–2009, 2017–present). For this role, he has a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination. In 2014, he began playing Leonard Snart / Captain Cold in The CW series The Flash, and later the spin-off Legends of Tomorrow. His first screenplay, the thriller drama Stoker, was released in 2013. Miller was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England. He moved to Brooklyn, New York, United States at the age of one. His parents are Americans. His father has African-American, Jamaican, English, German, Jewish, and Cherokee background, and his mother is of Russian, French, Dutch, Syrian, and Lebanese ancestry. In 2007, Miller denied to InStyle that he was gay. He later came out as gay in August 2013, when he posted a letter on GLAAD's website. In the letter he turned down the offer to go to the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival. The reason was because he felt \"deeply troubled\" by the Russian government's treatment of its gay citizens. This was referring to anti-LGBT laws passed banning \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Actors from Brooklyn Category:Actors from Oxfordshire Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:English LGBT people Category:LGBT actors Category:LGBT people from New York City Category:Models from New York City Category:Movie producers from New York City Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Screenwriters from New York City",
