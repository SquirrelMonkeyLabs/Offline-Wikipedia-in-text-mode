 "text": "Hurricane Danny was a hurricane in United States. It was the only hurricane to make landfall in the United States during the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the second hurricane and fourth tropical storm of the season. Like the previous four tropical or subtropical cyclones of the season, Danny did not start in the tropics. A trough caused convection that entered the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Danny was guided northeast through the Gulf of Mexico by two high pressure areas, a rare occurrence in the middle of July. After making landfall on the Gulf Coast, Danny moved across the southeastern United States. It later affected parts of New England with rain and wind. Danny is notable for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes generated by it, and the destruction it caused. It killed nine people. It caused $ (1997 USD, $ 2022 USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama. At least 36.71 inches (932 mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred in many areas of the Gulf Coast. Of the nine deaths caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four occurred in Georgia, two occurred in South Carolina, and two occurred in North Carolina. == References == Category:Hurricanes in Virginia Category:Hurricanes in Louisiana Category:Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes Category:1997 in the United States Category:1990s in weather Category:Hurricanes in Mississippi",
