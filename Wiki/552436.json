 "text": "Suffocation is an American brutal death metal band from Centereach, New York, United States. The band members are Frank Mullen (vocalist), Terrance Hobbs and Charlie Errigo (both guitarisits), Eric Morotti (drummer) and Derek Boyer (bassist). Their 1991 album, Effigy of the Forgotten, created a blueprint for the genre for the 1990s. The band has a raw death metal style that uses growled vocals with a downtuned guitar sound, fast and complex guitar riffs and drumming, open chord notes, breakdowns, and a complex sense of songwriting. Decibel Magazine has stated that Suffocation's music completely influenced the creation of deathcore. == Discography == === Studio albums === *Effigy of the Forgotten (1991) *Breeding the Spawn (1993) *Pierced from Within (1995) *Souls to Deny (2004) *Suffocation (2006) *Blood Oath (2009) *Pinnacle of Bedlam (2013) ===EP's=== *Human Waste (1991) *Despise the Sun (1998) ===Live albums=== *Close of a Chapter: Live in Québec City (2005) ===Compilation albums=== *The Best of Suffocation (2008) ==Members== ;Current members * Frank Mullen – vocals (1988–1998, 2002–present; semi-retired since 2013) * Terrance Hobbs – lead guitar (1988–1998, 2002–present) * Derek Boyer – bass guitar (2004–present) * Ricky Myers – vocals (2014–present) * Charlie Errigo – rhythm guitar (2016–present) * Eric Morotti– drums (2016–present) ;Former members * Mike Smith – drums (1988–1994, 2002–2012) * Josh Barohn – bass (1988–1991, 2002–2004) * Guy Marchais – rhythm guitar (1988–1990, 2002–2016) * Doug Cerrito – rhythm guitar (1990–1998) * Chris Richards – bass (1991–1998) * Doug Bohn – drums (1994–1996) * Dave Culross – drums (1996–1998, 2012–2014) * Kevin Talley – drums (2014–2016) ;Live members * Bill Robinson – vocals (2012) * John Gallagher – vocals (2013) ===Timeline=== == References == Category:Musical groups established in 1988 Category:Musical groups from New York (state)",
