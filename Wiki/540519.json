 "text": "Josh Robert Thompson is an American voice actor, comedian, puppeteer, and actor. He currently works on Family Guy. He is probably best known for voicing and being the puppeteer of Geoff Peterson on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Thompson is known for his celebrity impressions, including Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Matthew McConaughey. ==Early life== Thompson grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, \"raised by classic television.\" He would watch as actors became different characters and began to mimic them. At age eight, his grandmother bought him a Fisher-Price tape recorder that he used to create radio-style \"shows\", voicing the host and the guests. The following year, he performed on stage in Peter Pan at the Cleveland Play House. During his junior year at Padua Franciscan High School, Thompson delivered one line for the school's production of Oklahoma! and walked off to laughter and applause. \"Then someone backstage said, 'They're clapping for you. They love you.' After that, I was hooked.\" Thompson and some of his classmates got a video camera and began making feature-length and short films, and television-style shows. He graduated from Padua in 1993. Thompson moved to Los Angeles a few years later and performed on local television and as a stand-up comic while working toward his degree in TV, Radio and Film Production at California State University, Fullerton. He uses his middle name professionally because a \"Josh Thompson\" was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:American voice actors Category:Comedians from Cleveland Category:Living people Category:Actors from Cleveland Category:1975 births Category:American television actors",
