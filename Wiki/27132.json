 "text": "Lakshmi is the goddess of money, wisdom and good luck in Hinduism. Most Hindus pray to her on Diwali, which is a festival in India. She is regarded as an equivalent goddess of Emoinu, her Meitei counterpart. Lakshmi has four arms, fair skin and sits on a lotus flower and is normally surrounded by elephants. She is covered in jewellery. She also has several avatars (means a god coming to the earth in the form of a human being or in any other form). Her husband is the Hindu god Vishnu but her other avatars are usually married to Vishnu's avatars: * Sita, wife of Rama * Radha, the eternal wife and chief consort of Krishna * Rukmini, the principal wife and first queen consort of Krishna ==Related pages== * Hindu Goddess == Further reading == * * == References == == Other websites == * Maha Lakshmi Purana *108 Aspects of Wealth * The Online mandir of Mahalakshmi * Know about Goddess Sri Lakshmi * Hymns and eulogies on Lakshmi * Lakshmi Puran Category:Hindu gods and goddesses Category:Hindu goddesses",
