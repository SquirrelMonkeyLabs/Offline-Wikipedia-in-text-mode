 "text": "The Imperial War Museum North is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford. Its building is on the south side of the Manchester Ship Canal opposite MediaCityUK. It is part of the Imperial War Museum whose main office is in Southwark. The building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind. It opened in July 2002, with 470,000 visitors in its first year. It is a prime example of Deconstructivist architecture. Inside there is a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jet and the 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. Outside there is an ex-Iraqi Army T-55 tank which was captured by the Royal Engineers during the Iraq War in 2003. The exhibitions at the museum are frequently changed. == References == Category:Trafford Category:Museums in England",
