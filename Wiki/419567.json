 "text": "Cerdic (475-4 May 534) was the first Anglo Saxon King of the Gewisse, also called the King of Wessex. He was the ancestor of the kings of Wessex and the Anglo-Saxon kings of England beginning with Athelstan. == War leader and king == According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Cerdic, along with his son Cynric, came to Britain in 495. Benjamin Thorpe, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle according to the Several Original Authorities: Translation (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1861), p. 14 Their three ships landed at Cerdic's ora fought the Britons there on the same day. Most of what is known about Cerdic comes from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 20 In 519 he and his son defeated Britons at Cerdic's ford and took Wessex.Frank Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England (Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 21 In 527 at a place called Cerdic's leaga Cerdic and Cynric battled with the Britons again. In 530 they conquered the Isle of Wight. The record for 534 states that Cerdic died this year.Benjamin Thorpe, The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle according to the Several Original Authorities: Translation (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1861), p. 14 Cerdic was succeeded by his son Cynric.Mike Ashley, The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens (New york: Carroll & Graf, 1999), p. 301 The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gave Cenred a pedigree going back to the Saxon god Woden. But historian Kenneth Sisam showed this legendary pedigree was borrowed from the Kings of Bernicia and was not historic.Kenneth Sisam, 'Anglo-Saxon Royal Genealogies', Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. 39 (1953), pp. 287-348 But archaeological evidence shows that outside of Kent and Sussex, the main area of settlement was in the upper Thames Valley.Peter Hunter Blair, Roman Britain and Early England; 55 B.C.â€“A.D. 871 (New York; London: W. W. Norton & Company, 1966), p. 203 This agrees with much of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle although dates are harder to verify. It should be noted that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is not a reliable document for the period contemporary to Cerdic's supposed reign. It should also be noted that Cerdic is a British name and not an Anglo- Saxon name. It is also unlikely that Wessex was the name of his proposed kingdom. Ultimately, Cerdic should be considered as mythology. == Family == Cerdic had: * Cynric (died 560) G. H.
