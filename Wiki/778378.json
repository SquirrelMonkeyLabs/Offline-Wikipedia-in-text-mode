 "text": "The Cherokee language (ᏣᎳᎩ ᎦᏬᏂᎯᏍᏗ, Tsalagi Gawonihisdi) is an endangered language spoken by the Cherokee people. == Writing system == The Cherokee language does not use the Latin alphabet (ABCs) like English does. Instead, it uses its own alphabet, which has some letters that look like the ABCs. Each letter represents a different syllable sound. This special alphabet was invented by a Cherokee man named Sequoyah. Below is a chart of all the letters of the Cherokee alphabet and the sound each one makes. Notes: # In the chart, ‘v’ represents a nasal vowel, which is pronounced like \"ung\" in \"lung\". # The character Ꮩ do is shown upside-down in some fonts. It should look like the Latin letter V. == Grammar == The Cherokee language uses many prefixes and suffixes. == Notes == ==References== == Other websites == *Wiktionary in Cherokee Category:Languages of the United States Category:Tonal languages Category:Oklahoma Category:Endangered languages Category:Cherokee Nation Category:Iroquoian languages",
