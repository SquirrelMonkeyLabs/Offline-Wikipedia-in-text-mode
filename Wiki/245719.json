A demigod is special as he or she has a godly parent, despite the lack of great powers as he or she also has a human parent. Demigods are usually mortal, an example of which is Hercules. Hercules' father, Jupiter, or Zeus, made him a god after Hercules died. Other demigods in Classical mythology, include but not limited to Achilles, Heracles and Romulus and Remus. ==Related pages== *God *Myth *Angel *Religion ** Islam ** Taoism ** Sikhism ** Judaism ** Hinduism ** Shintoism ** Buddhism ** Christianity ** Confucianism ** Zoroastrianism *Goddess *Paganism *Mythology *Shamanism *Roman Empire *Helladic period *Ancient history *List of religions *Ancient Greece *Classical antiquity Category:Gods and goddesses",
