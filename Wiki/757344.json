 "text": "The Souls series is a series of action RPGs made by Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware. The games in the series are Demon's Souls and the three Dark Souls games. King's Field, Bloodborne, and Sekiro are similarly made games also made by From Software, but they not part of the series. The games are made cheaply, which allowed the games to make a lot of money even if they did not sell as well as some other games. Below are the features in all the games. * The series takes place in a fantasy world based on Medieval Europe. Many of the buildings, weapons, and armor is based on real-life things from Medieval Europe. The story and monsters are based on those from Catholicism, Greek and Norse mythology. * The games have a high level of difficulty. The player can die easily if they are not careful, and many enemies and bosses have attacks that can kill the player in one hit. *Said difficulty cannot be changed to make the game easier or harder. * Running, rolling, blocking using a shield, and attacking uses stamina, or energy needed to do actions. If the player runs out of stamina, they can do none of those actions until stamina refills. The player and enemies both have slow movement and attack speed, so the player will need to learn how to roll well and time their attacks carefully to kills enemies and not die. * Souls are the game's experience points and currency, which you need to buy equipment and upgrade the player's stats, weapons, and armor. The player gets souls by killing enemies and using souls dropped by some carcasses. * If the player dies, all their souls are dropped in the same place the player died. After the player dies, they only have one life to get back their dropped souls, unless the player uses special items. If the player dies before getting back their souls, those dropped souls will be gone forever. * While the game only has a single-player mode, the game has online features that will turn on if the player is online. These feature include leaving behind hints to help other players play the game, help other players fight bosses, or attack other players. * Certain weapons can only be used if the player has enough stats. *How quickly the player can move depends on how much equipment they have on them. If the player's equipment has too much weight, the player will be very slow. * Music only plays in certain areas and during boss fights. Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video game series",
