Once the player completes what they have to do, the game goes back to the map screen. As the player plays further in the game, they will be able to take different routes when they complete some levels. Each route has different planets that the player can visit depending on what route they choose. ===Multiplayer=== Multiplayer can be played with up to six players in DS Download Play, and with up to three players in Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection play. The goal is to destroy the ships of the other players and collect stars that they leave behind. Players can collect stars from opponents that were not killed by the player. Nintendo Wi-Fi play ranks a player from Z to A, with Z being the lowest and A being the highest. Every time a player wins a match, they get an amount of percent. When the player reaches 100%, they move to the next letter. ==References== Category:2006 video games Category:Star Fox Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games Category:Scrolling shooters Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games about animals Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U",
