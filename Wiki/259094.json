It is the largest radio broadcaster, entertainment television production, program syndication provider and media conglomerate in the Philippines. It is a subsidiary of Lopez Holdings Corporation which is owned by the LÃ³pez family of Iloilo. ABS-CBN was formed by the merger of Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) and Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN). The company was founded in July 11, 1946 by American electronics engineer James Lindenberg as Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC). In 1952, BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS) with its corporate name, Alto Sales Corporation after Judge Antonio Quirino, brother of President Elpidio Quirino, purchased the company and later launched the first TV station in the country, DZAQ-TV on October 23, 1953. The company that would later be merged with ABS to form ABS-CBN was founded in 1956 as Chronicle Broadcasting Network, Inc. (CBN) by Eugenio Lopez Sr. and his brother Fernando Lopez, who was the sitting Vice President of the Philippines. A year later, the Lopezes acquired ABS. The ABS-CBN brand was first used on television in 1961. The company became known as ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation on February 1, 1967. The conglomerate's primary name, along with the corporate name of the network of the same name, then changed to simply ABS-CBN Corporation in August 2007, to signify the former's diversification. Due to the change in the conglomerate's primary name and network's corporate name, the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation name is now used as the company's alternative and secondary name in certain contexts. The common shares of ABS- CBN were first traded on the Philippine Stock Exchange in July 1992 under the ticker symbol ABS. ==History== In 1946, when James Lindenberg was about to make it a radio called Bolinao Electronics Corporation, they settled all the equipment.
