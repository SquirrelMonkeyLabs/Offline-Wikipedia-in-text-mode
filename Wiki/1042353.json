It was also certified 5× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song is about body image and positivity. About the song, Cara said \"It's just a song about these things that certain women go through on a daily basis in order to feel loved or in order to love themselves. I think that's such a thing that goes on in today's world. These weird things are instilled in us. You know? They tell us that we’re not good enough or that there's only one kind of beauty. This song basically is contradicting that idea. It's saying, 'Well, if the world doesn't like how you look then they should change. They should change their perspective. You don’t have to change yourself.'\" She also said that it was \"Basically about embracing yourself and finally coming to that conclusion where you feel love and you can love yourself.\" A music video for the song was released. In the video, Cara sings in an abandoned warehouse room. Different people then introduce themselves. Throughout the video, the people talk about their scars and body image issues. American singer JoJo also makes an appearance. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2015 songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Pop songs Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Synth-pop songs",
