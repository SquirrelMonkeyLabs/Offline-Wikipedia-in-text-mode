He is a founding member of the Society of Christian Philosophers. Plantinga's aim in philosophy is to defend believing in God as rational. His epistemology is one that tries to say that knowledge is only possible if you accept the possibility of some form of intelligent design by God. ==References== Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:20th- century American philosophers Category:21st-century American philosophers Category:Academics from Indiana Category:American Calvinists Category:American theologians Category:People from Ann Arbor, Michigan",
