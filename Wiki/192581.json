 "text": "Repertoire (pronounce: \"Re-per-twahr\") is a French word used in music and in the theatre. It means a list of pieces of music or plays. Sometimes the English word repertory is used. When a pianist speaks about his or her \"repertoire\", it means all the pieces that he can play. Most famous musicians have a wide repertoire (they can play a lot of pieces). The \"piano repertoire\" means all music written for the piano. The violin has a much larger solo repertoire than the viola. That means that much more solo music has been written for the violin than for the viola. A theatre company may have a \"repertoire\". That means all the plays that they regularly perform. Sometimes theatre companies are called \"repertory theatres\" because they have a particular list of plays that they perform. == References == Category:Music Category:Theater",
