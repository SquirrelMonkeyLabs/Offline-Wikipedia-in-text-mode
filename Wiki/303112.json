 "text": "Falling in Reverse is a post-hardcore band formed in 2008 at Las Vegas, Nevada by Ronnie Radke, the former lead singer of Escape the Fate. == History== The band formed in December 2008, by Ronnie Radke with the aid of Nason Schoeffler, under the name From Behind These Walls. This name was changed in August of 2009 due to copyright problems. At the time the band was started, Radke was in prison (which is the reason behind the band's original name), and he was the only member. In 2009, Radke released the demos Listen Up, The Worst Time, and The Departure, which in fact were not recorded by the band, but rather Radke himself alone in 2002. In December 12, 2010, Ronnie Radke was released from prison, and was signed by the indie label Epitaph Records based on the demos he made while being in jail. Several months after his release, Radke and the rest of the band began to record their album. The album was quickly finished by February of 2011. Falling In Reverse released two singles to promote their album. The first single, Raised by Wolves, was released July 7, 2011. The Drug in Me Is You was released shortly after on July 27. The full-length album was released July 26, 2011, named The Drug in Me Is You, with Epitaph Records. The band participated in the 'Warped Tour 2011', from August 10 to August 14. == Discography == ; Albums * The Drug in Me Is You (2011) * Fashionably Late (2013) * Just Like You (2015) * Coming Home (2017) * Popular Monster (2024) ; Singles List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications Title Album details Peak chart positions Sales Certifications US US Rock AUS BEL (WA) CAN NZ SCO Peak positions in Scottish Albums Chart: * \"Coming Home\": UK Peak chart positions for albums in the UK Albums Chart: * All except noted: * The Drug in Me Is You: The Drug in Me Is You *Released: July 26, 2011 (US) *Label: Epitaph *Formats: CD, digital download, LP (2020) 19 3 21 — 60 — — 125 * RIAA: Gold *BPI: Silver Fashionably Late *Released: June 18, 2013 (US) *Label: Epitaph *Formats: CD, digital download 17 4 20 — — — — 75 * US: 105,000 Just Like You *Released: February 24, 2015 (US) *Label: Epitaph *Formats: CD, LP, digital download 21 4 8 — — 27 — 57 Coming Home *Released: April 7, 2017 (US) *Label: Epitaph *Formats: CD, LP, digital download 34 5 16 150 — — 87 89 * US: 97,000 Popular Monsterhttps://www.epitaph.com/artists/falling-in-reverse/release/popular- monster-2 *Will Release: July 26, 2024 *Label: Epitaph *Format: Streaming — — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. ==Singles== List of singles, with selected chart positions, showing year released, certifications and album name Title Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US US Rock CAN CAN Rock FIN GER Rock Peak positions on the Germany Rock chart: * \"Drugs\": * \"Zombified\": * \"Voices in My Head\": * \"Watch the World Burn\": * \"Last Resort (Reimagined)\": HUN Peak positions in Hungary: * \"Popular Monster\": * \"The Drug in Me Is Reimagined\": * \"Voices in My Head\": * \"Watch the World Burn\": NZ Hot Peaks on the NZ Hot Singles Chart: * \"Zombified\": * \"Voices in My Head\": * \"Watch the World Burn\": * \"Last Resort\" (Reimagined): UK Peak chart positions for singles in the chart in United Kingdom: * \"Watch the World Burn\": UK Rock Peak chart positions for singles in the rock chart in United Kingdom: * \"Alone\": * \"Popular Monster\": * \"Zombified\": \"Raised by Wolves\" 2011 — — — — — — — — — — The Drug in Me Is You \"The Drug in Me Is You\" — — — — — — — — — — *BPI: Silver \"I'm Not a Vampire\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Good Girls, Bad Guys\" 2012 — — — — — — — — — — \"Pick Up the Phone\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Alone\" 2013 — 27 — — — — — — — 14 Fashionably Late \"Fashionably Late\" — 46 — — — — — — — — \"Born to Lead\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Bad Girls Club\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Gangsta's Paradise\" 2014 — — — — — — — — — — Punk Goes 90s Vol. 2 \"God, If You Are Above...\" — 45 — — — — — — — — Just Like You \"Guillotine IV (The Final Chapter)\" 2015 — — — — — — — — — — \"Stay Away\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Sexy Drug\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Just Like You\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Chemical Prisoner\" 2016 — — — — — — — — — — \"Coming Home\" — — — — — — — — — — Coming Home \"Loser\" 2017 — 35 — — — — — — — — \"Broken\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Superhero\" — — — — — — — — — \"Fuck You and All Your Friends\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Losing My Mind\" 2018 — 50 — — — — — — — — Popular Monster \"Losing My Life\" — — — — — — — — — — \"Drugs\" 2019 — — — — — 1 — — — — \"Popular Monster\" — 4 — 38 — — 33 — — 17 *RIAA: 2× Platinum *ARIA: 3× Platinum *BPI: Silver \"The Drug in Me Is Reimagined\" 2020 — 29 — — — — 32 — — — rowspan=\"3\" \"Carry On\" — — — — — — — — — — \"I'm Not a Vampire (Revamped) 2021 — — — — — — — — — — \"Zombified\" 2022 — 16 — 31 67 11 — 34 — 12 *RIAA: Gold Popular Monster \"Voices in My Head\" — 19 — — — 1 30 40 — — * RIAA: Gold \"Watch the World Burn\" 2023 83 8 77 — — 1 38 16 95 — * RIAA: Gold \"Last Resort (Reimagined)\" — 13 — — — 1 — 33 — — \"Ronald\" 2024 — — — — — — — — — — \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. ==Other appearances== Title Year Album \"Gangsta's Paradise\" 2014 Punk Goes 90's 2 \"She's a Rebel\" 2014 Kerrang!
