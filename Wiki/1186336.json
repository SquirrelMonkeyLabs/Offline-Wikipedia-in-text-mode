 "text": "Sodium perchlorate is a chemical compound made of sodium, chlorine, and oxygen. It is the sodium salt of perchloric acid. Its formula is NaClO₄. It looks like a white crystal and can absorb water from the air. This means it is hygroscopic. It dissolves easily in water and ethanol. The most common form of it has one water attached. It is written as NaClO₄·H₂O. Among similar chemicals, sodium perchlorate is the most water-soluble. This means it mixes with water better than the other perchlorates. Sodium perchlorate and other perchlorates have also been found on Mars. NASA’s Phoenix lander first discovered them in 2009. Then in 2015, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found signs of salty water on Mars. Scientists believe hydrated salts like sodium perchlorate might have been part of it. These could be evidence that there was water on Mars. == Preparation == Sodium perchlorate can be made by electrolysis of sodium chlorate or sodium chloride that is dissolved in water. Perchlorate is made by oxidation of chlorate at the anode: : Sodium is a spectator ion. == Uses == It is used to make perchloric acid and other perchlorate compounds. == References == Category:Sodium compounds Category:Chlorine compounds Category:Oxygen compounds",
