This frog has brown skin with dark marks on its back. Some of the frogs have two lighter stripes down their sides. Each frog has white skin on its belly and pink or gray skin on the insides of its legs. ==Reproduction== This frog has many young ones when there is a lot of rain. It has the most in December. The male frog digs a small hole in the ground called a burrow. He sings for the females on the ground. The female frog lays about 10 eggs in the burrow, covered in foam. The tadpoles live in this foam nest and not in a pond or stream. ==Food== This frog looks for food during the day and at night. This frog eats many kinds of insects and other animals with no bones. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
