 "text": "Montanoceratops (meaning \"Montana horned face\") was a ceratopsian dinosaur, walked on four legs, had a large head, a bulky body, a parrot-like beak, a small nose horn, cheek teeth, and a small frill on its head. Males may have had larger frills than females, indicating that the frill may have been used in courtship and mating. == Description == Montanoceratops was up to 6 feet long (1.8 m) and weighed about 900 pounds (400 kg). Montanoceratops lived in the late-Cretaceous period, about 72 to 65 million years ago, toward the end of the Mesozoic, the Age of Reptiles. Fossils have been found in Montana and Alberta, Canada.
