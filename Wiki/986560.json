It went to number 1 in New Zealand, number 2 in the United Kingdom, number 3 in Australia, Iceland and Japan, number 4 in the United States and number 9 in Norway. It was nominated for 2 Grammy Awards. ==Track listing== All songs by Billy Joel, except for the chorus for \"This Night,\" which is credited on the sleeve to L. v. Beethoven. The track listing on the LP is slightly different from that on the cassette and original CD pressings, with the latter swapping the places of \"The Longest Time\" and \"Uptown Girl.\" However, on the actual cassette shell and disc label, the songs are listed (and play) in the correct order as printed on the LP. == References == Category:1983 albums Category:Billy Joel albums",
