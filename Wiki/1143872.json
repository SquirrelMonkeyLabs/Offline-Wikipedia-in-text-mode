He is a cousin of Hassan Nasrallah. He was seen as the \"number two\" in Hezbollah before Nasrallah's assassination on 27 September 2024. On 3 October 2024, Safieddine was targeted by an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. On 5 October, it was reported that Hezbollah had lost contact with Safieddine since the airstrike.
