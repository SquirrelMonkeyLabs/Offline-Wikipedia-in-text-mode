His oldest son, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, also became president of Chile (1994â€“2000). Frei Montalva died on 22 January 1982 in Santiago de Chile from sepsis caused by hernia surgery, aged 71. After his death, conspiracy theories were made saying that he was poisoned while having surgery.Ex-Chilean leader 'was murdered', BBC, 23 January 2007. It was said that Mustard gas was given to him instead on anesthesia to make him weak enough not to survive the surgery. In 2019, six men were sentenced to 10 years in prison for their involvement in Frei Montalva's death. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Presidents of Chile Category:Presidents of the Senate of Chile Category:Deaths from surgical complications Category:Deaths from sepsis Category:Deaths from hernia Category:Unexplained deaths Category:Conspiracy theories Category:Politicians from Santiago",
