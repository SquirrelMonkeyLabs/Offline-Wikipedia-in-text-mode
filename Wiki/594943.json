 "text": "The California gubernatorial election, 1966 was held on November 8, 1966. The election was a race between incumbent Governor Pat Brown, the Democratic candidate, and actor Ronald Reagan, the Republican candidate. ==Background== After his re-election victory over former Vice President Richard Nixon in 1962, Brown was strongly considered for Lyndon Johnson's 1964 ticket, a spot that eventually went to Hubert Humphrey. However, Brown's popularity began to sag amidst the civil disorders of the Watts riots and the early anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at U.C. Berkeley. The Republicans seized upon Brown's sudden unpopularity by nominating a well known and charismatic political outsider â€“ actor Ronald Reagan. With Richard Nixon working tirelessly behind the scenes and Reagan trumpeting his law and order campaign message, Reagan received almost 2/3 of the primary vote over George Christopher, the moderate Republican former mayor of San Francisco. ==Results== Reagan won the election in a landslide victory with 3,742,913 (57.55%) of the vote to Brown's 2,479,174 (42.27%).http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=6&year;=1966&f;=0&off;=5&elect;=0 ==References== ==Other websites== * Autumn and Cardboard: The 1966 California Gubernatorial Election * Reagan Heritage * Bepress (pg 13) * SFgate California gubernatorial election Category:California elections Category:1960s in California Category:Gubernatorial elections in the United States",
