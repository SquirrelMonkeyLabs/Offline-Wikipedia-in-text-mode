 "text": "The vulva is the part of the body of female mammals (including women) where the outside parts of the reproductive system can be seen. The parts of the vulva that can be seen are the: *Mons pubis *Labia majora *Labia minora *Clitoris *Vaginal opening *Urinary opening The mons pubis is the area of skin and fat above the other structures. It protects the other structures below it. The labia majora are thick areas of skin and fat located to the side of the urinary and vaginal openings. Smaller and thinner labia are the labia minora. These structures are connected to the hood of the clitoris. They are close to the vagina. Many people say the word vagina when they mean the vulva. The vagina is the tube connecting the internal parts (the womb) to the vulva. ==Related pages== *Vulvar cancer ==References== Category:Anatomy of the female reproductive system Category:Female reproductive system",
