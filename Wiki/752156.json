 "text": "A semivowel, also known as a glide or semiconsonant, is a consonant that almost sounds like a vowel. In English, there are two semivowels referred to as W and Y (written as /w/ and /j/ in IPA). In Latin, even though semivowels are phonemes, or unique sounds, it had no special letters used for them. The letters V and I were used to write the sounds /w/ and /j/, and these same letters were also used to write the vowels /u/ and /i/ in the same order. For example, Gaius Julius Caesar was written as Gaivs Ivlivs Caesar and wine was written as vinvm. The letter J was added after the fall of the Roman Empire to write the semivowel /j/ to show the difference between /j/ and /i/. == References == Category:Consonants",
