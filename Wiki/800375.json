 "text": "Fight Club is a 2004 fighting video game based on both the book and movie of the same name. It was released on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. None of the actors of the movie except for Meat Loaf returned to voice in the game. ==Gameplay== A 3D brawler has a player fight against another playable character with X-Rays shown during fights. ==Plot== An unnamed man has been picked to Tyler Durden to join Fight Club and eventually Project Mayhem. The man became Tyler Durden's right hand man. He was given the bomb operation controls. As the Narrator shot himself, the man wanted to help him. He went into the other side of the building and detonated the skyscrapers. ==Reception== The game is considered terrible compared to the book and movie and most people didn't like how the game misses the satirical message and how generic the game was.
