 "text": "Many periods have been called golden periods in the History of India, because there were different important achievements at different times. ==Gupta Empire== The period between the 4th century and 6th century AD is known as the Golden Age of India because of the large achievements Indians made in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, sculpting and painting during the Gupta Empire. Significant contributions to the decimal numeral system, including the concept of zero happened during this period in India. The Golden Age in India came to an end when the Hunas invaded the Gupta Empire in the 6th century AD. ==Chola Dynasty== South India in the 10th and 11th century AD under the imperial Chola Dynasty has been called Golden Age as well. The period saw extensive achievements in architecture, literature, sculpture and bronze working, maritime conquests with extensive trade, and quasi-democratic reforms. ==References== ==Other websites== * GUPTA DYNASTY, GOLDEN AGE OF INDIA * The Golden Age of Classical India * Gupta and Harsha: The Classical Age * Frontline Article on Gupta period Art Category:History of India Category:Periods and ages in history",
