 "text": "A viaduct is a bridge composed of several small spans. It is built for crossing a valley, dry or wetland, or forming an overpass or flyover. The word viaduct has two parts from Latin: via for road and ducere, to lead. The ancient Romans did not use this word; it was invented in the nineteenth- century by analogy with aqueduct. == References == Category:Bridges",
