It is suspected but not proven that American heavy metal music group Nuclear Hellfrost from Fort Wayne, Indiana damaged the site. Pantera told law enforcement about this, who are trying to find answers. Close to 4:12 P.M. (Central Standard Time) on February 28th, Nuclear Hellfrost said on Facebook that their former lead singer damaged the site by himself without the other members of the group. == References == Category:1966 births Category:2004 deaths Category:American guitarists Category:American heavy metal musicians Category:American murder victims Category:Murdered musicians Category:Murders by firearm in the United States Category:Musicians from Texas",
