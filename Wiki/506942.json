During the Middle Ages, the city growed a lot thanks to its location near many Alpine cities. The extra money that the city earned from its trade helped expand its borders.

In 1936, the city was officially named \"Wangen in Allgäu.\" From 1938 to 1972, Wangen was the capital of the Wangen rural district.
