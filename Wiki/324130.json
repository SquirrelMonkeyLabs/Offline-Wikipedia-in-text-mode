 "text": "Young Frankenstein is a 1974 horror comedy movie directed by Mel Brooks starring Gene Wilder, Teri Garr, Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, Danny Goldman, David L. Lander, Michael McKean, Richard Haydn and Gene Hackman. The movie is a parody of the classical horror movie genre. In 2003, it was deemed \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the United States National Film Preservation Board and selected for preservation in the Library of Congress National Film Registry. It tells the story of Frederick Frankenstein, grandson of Victor, the mad scientist whose experiments in re-animation led to the creation of a monster; to disassociate himself from his legacy, Frederick insists that his surname be pronounced \"Fronk-en-steen\". He has to travel to Transylvania because he has inherited his family's estate, where he meets Igor, a hunchbacked, bulging- eyed servant and Inga.
