Johnson was the leader and made his home the organization's base. The Flat Earth Society has its headquarters in the small town of CÃºllar Vega, Andalusia, Spain since 2002. Some people say that various international space organisations proved that the Earth is not flat by taking pictures of the planet from space. Others say the round Earth was proven long before those existed. The Society says the pictures are fake, and that the goverment and space organisations like NASA is a part of a conspiracy. ==Related pages== * Flat Earth * Nicolaus Copernicus == Other websites == * One of the associations calling itself the original Flat Earth Society Category:Earth",
