In ancient times, it was the Kingdom of MÃ¶ab. There have been many archaeological findings that have helped reconstruct its history. It is also described in the Old Testament of the Bible. According to Genesis (19:37), it was inhabited by the children of Moab, a grandson and sonof Lot. The Moabites were often at war with its neighbours to the west, the Israelites. The capital of Moab was Dibon. A well-known Moabite is Ruth. According to the Biblical Book of Ruth, she married an Israelite man and became the greatgrandmother of king David. == Related pages == * Massive Ordnance Air Blast - MOAB ==Other websites== *Catholic encyclopedia Category:Ancient history by country Category:History of Jordan Category:Old Testament",
