It is set in a mental asylum in Oregon which is run by the tyrannical Nurse Ratched and where the new patient Randle McMurphy rebels against her. It was made into a movie in 1975 that was directed by Milo≈° Forman. The movie stars Jack Nicholson as the patient Randle McMurphy and Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. It was very popular, and won 5 Academy Awards. The novel's writer, Kesey, disliked the movie, because it did not take the perspective (view) of a Native American character, Chief Bromden (a more important character in the book than in the movie). It was a very controversial book when it was published. The novel is now considered a classic.
