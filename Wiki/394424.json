A&W; was the first successful franchise company: the franchises began in the 1920s in California. The company's name was taken from the surnames of partners Roy W. Allen and Frank Wright. Yum! Brands purchased the company in 2002. In 2011 the company was sold back to a group of franchise owners. Kevin Bazner returned as the CEO. The menu of A&W; includes hamburgers, french fries, hot dogs and other fast food style meals. A&W; has restaurants across the United States. A&W; exists in Canada, but it has been owned by a different company since 1972. As of 2017 there were 634 restaurants in the United States and 328 international restaurants. A&W; is known for \"frosty mugs\". This is when the mug is kept in the freezer. It is removed, filled with A&W; Root Beer, and then served to the customer. A number of A&W;'s are drive-in restaurants with carhops. ==References== Category:1919 establishments in California Category:American fast food restaurants Category:Companies based in Kentucky",
