The Hokage is the strongest ninja and the leader for the village, called Konoha (meaning \"leaf\" in Japanese). As the series progresses, Naruto and his friends begin to solve the ancient history of the ninja world. His friends including Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Their teacher is Kakashi Hatake. The manga was first published in 1999 in a Japanese magazine called Shonen Jump. It was also translated into English. The anime series premiered in Japan in October 2002. In the United States, it started in September 2005. == Plot == === Part I === Twelve years ago, a spiritual Nine-Tail fox attacked the Hidden Leaf Village, Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki sacrificed themselves to seal the monster within a boy named Naruto. Nobody told Naruto that the fox was sealed inside him. The villagers treated him badly because of the monster. When Naruto found out the truth, it made him want to become the next Hokage and earn everyone's respect. After graduating from being a genin, Naruto joined Team 7. The members of Team 7 were Naruto, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno and their teacher Kakashi Hatake. They defeated Zabuza and Haku in the Land of Waves. Orochimaru interrupted the Chunin Exam, killing the Third Hokage and Fourth Kazekage. Orochimaru tricked the army of the Hidden Sand into opposing the Leaf. Jiraiya trained Naruto, while Tsunade became the Fifth Hokage. Sasuke left the village and looked for revenge against Itachi. Naruto defeated five enemies from the Land of Sound through the forest, but he failed to stop Sasuke from joining up with Orochimaru. === Part II === Two and a half years later, Naruto recruited Sai and Yamato. The Akatsuki organization started kidnapping ninja hosts. Sasuke formed a tracking party and defeated Itachi. Then he became stronger and joined Akatsuki. Naruto learned Sage Mode. He defeated Nagato for killing Jiraiya and devastating the village, even though he became good. Tobi interrupted the meeting and declared the Fourth Great Ninja War. He had a plan to reform the legendary Ten Tails from the nine tailed beasts. That would control humanity and achieve world peace. After learning Chakra Mode with the fox spirit, Naruto helped the Allied Shinobi Forces defeat the army of White Zetsu. Tobi was revealed to be Obito, who kept the power of the eyes containing the Rinnegan and Sharingan. When Madara came back to life and stole Obito's half of the power, he turned into the Sage of Six Paths. He used the power of the forbidden art to trap everyone in the Ninja World (except Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi, Obito and other dead ninjas). Black Zetsu fused with Madara to complete the reincarnation. That freed Kaguya Otsutsuki to take his place. In the past, Kaguya's son, Hagoromo, had trained Ashura and Indra. Ashura and Indra were the first incarnations who came before Naruto and Sasuke. After Kaguya killed Obito, Kakashi sacrificed his power. Naruto and Sasuke worked together to seal Kaguya and Zetsu, and Madara died again. When Sasuke used the forbidden genjutsu, Naruto defeated and spared him. The world was peaceful and all the spiritual beasts were freed from Kaguya. Kakashi became Sixth Hokage. Sasuke realized his mistake, disabled the genjutsu, and forgave everyone. Years later, Naruto became the Seventh Hokage. He married Hinata Hyuga. They had two children. Their daughter was named Himawari, and their son was named Boruto. Boruto has a special eye and body mark. Boruto makes a new Team 7 with Konohamaru Sarutobi, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter Sarada, and Orochimaru's artificial son Mitsuki. Boruto helped Naruto and Sasuke defeat the two clansmen. Boruto learned that the new enemy group called \"Kara\" are using their own marks. Kawaki was taken to the Leaf Village and adopted by Naruto's family.
