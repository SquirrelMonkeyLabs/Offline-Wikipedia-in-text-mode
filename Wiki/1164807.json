 "text": "ONO 99 (also known as O'NO 99 in the older version), is a card game that is similar to UNO but you need to keep the discard pile total less than 99. If a player's hand makes the discard pile value 99 or over, then they are out of the game. The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining. Each player gets four cards in their hand at the start of the game and they must draw back to four cards after they discard a card. ==Cards== *Number cards (including zero): Adds the current value to the discard pile. (Example: If a player plays a four on top the discard pile which is 25, the discard pile will be 29). ===Special cards=== *Minus 10: Subtracts 10 from the current value to the discard pile (the cards value cannot be negative but it will stop at zero). *Reverse: Changes the direction of play. When there are two players in the game, the reverse card acts a zero card. *Play 2: The next player in the current direction must play two times. Play 2 cards do not stack (Example: If a player plays a play 2 on a play 2, the next player in the current direction wil not play four times but instead it will only play two times). *ONO 99 (card): This card cannot be played by itself but if a player has four of these cards, they can discard all four of these cards, then add zero to the discard pile and draw four new cards. ==Related pages== *Uno (card game) Category:Card games",
