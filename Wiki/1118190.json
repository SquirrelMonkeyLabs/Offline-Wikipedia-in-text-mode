 "text": "Area code 270 and 364 are area codes for Kentucky. 270 was created as a split from 502 on April 19, 1999. It covers cities such as Bowling Green, Hopkinsville, Owensboro, Paducah, Henderson, and Murray. It was overlaid by 364 on March 3, 2014, despite first being announced in 2007. The introduction of 364 was delayed several times due to number pooling which delayed the need for it to be introduced. Initially intended as a split in 2007 when first introduced, it was later changed to an overlay in September 2012 when it was announced that 270 was close to being used up and 364 could no longer be delayed. ==References== 270",
