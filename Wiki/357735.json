 "text": "Land of the Free is the national anthem of Belize. Samuel Alfred Haynes wrote the words. Selwyn Walford Young wrote the music. They did this in 1963. It became official in 1981. ==Lyrics== Words of the song in English Yucatec Maya translation I O, Land of the Free by the Carib Sea, Our manhood we pledge to thy liberty! No tyrants here linger, despots must flee This tranquil haven of democracy The blood of our sires which hallows the sod, Brought freedom from slavery, oppression's rod By the might of truth, and the grace of God, No longer shall we be hewers of wood! Arise! ye sons of the Baymen's clan, Put on your armour, clear the land! Drive back the tyrants, let despots flee - Land of the Free by the Carib Sea.'' II Nature has blessed thee with wealth untold, O'er mountains and valleys where prairies roll; Our fathers, the Baymen, valiant and bold Drove back the invader; this heritage hold From proud Rio Hondo to old Sarstoon, Through coral isle, over blue lagoon; Keep watch with the angels, the stars and moon; For freedom comes tomorrow's noon! ==References== Category:1963 songs Category:1981 establishments in Belize Category:North American anthems Category:National symbols of Belize",
