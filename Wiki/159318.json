 "text": "Implied repeal is a theory on the British constitution that laws can be amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament. If the British Parliament passes two laws about the same subject that state different things, the more recently enacted law states normally what must be done. The doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant (\"more recent laws overwrite earlier laws\"). == References == Category:Legal terms",
