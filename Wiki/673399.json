 "text": "The emblem of Guatemala was adopted in 1871. It comprises: * A wreath of bay laurel branches, the symbol for victory; * The resplendent quetzal, a bird that symbolizes liberty; * A parchment scroll on which is written LIBERTAD 15 DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1821 in gold (15 September 1821 is the date of Central America's independence from Spain); * Two crossed Remington rifles with bayonets indicating Guatemala's willingness to defend itself by force if need be; * Two crossed swords, representing honor. The emblem was designed by Swiss artist and engraver Johan-Baptist Frener, who lived in Guatemala from 1854 until his death in 1897. The emblem also appears on the middle third of the flag of Guatemala. The quetzal previously appeared in the flag of Los Altos, Central America in the 1830s. == Other websites == * Guatemala - Coat of Arms at Flags of the World Guatemala Category:National symbols of Guatemala",
