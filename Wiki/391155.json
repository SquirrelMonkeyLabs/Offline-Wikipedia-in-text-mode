 "text": "Virgin America was an U.S. airline. It began operations in 2007. https://www.virginamerica.com/cms/about-our-airline/press/2007/takes-to-the- skies Its corporate headquarters were located in California. The airline used Airbus A319 and Airbus A320 aircraft, flying to destinations throughout the United States and Mexico. The airline was partly owned by the Virgin Group. https://www.virginamerica.com/cms/about-our-airline/press/2015/virgin-america- reports-june-2015-operational-results The Virgin Group also controls Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Australia. However, the Virgin Group had less than a fifty percent share of the airline. This is due to U.S. federal laws that do not allow foreign control of domestic airlines. Virgin America was looking to sell all or part of its airline in early 2016. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Airlines announced it would buy Virgin America. Alaska retired the Virgin America name on April 25, 2018, and the airline's branding gradually started to disappear from planes and interiors from that date onwards. ==Gallery== File:Virgin America Airbus 320 N846VA Photo 194 (13836583815).jpg|A Virgin America A320 at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
