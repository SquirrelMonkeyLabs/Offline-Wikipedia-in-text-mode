 "text": "New Glenn is a heavy-lift launch vehicle created and operated by the American company Blue Origin. launches from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 36, with future missions planned from the Vandenberg Space Force Station. The rocket is made of three parts: the first stage, the second stage, and the payload fairing (holder). The first stage is powered by seven BE-4 engines, built by Blue Origin. It carries the other stages into the atmosphere. This stage is designed to be re-usable, and is capable of landing on a robotic boat. This will make it faster and cheaper to fly the rocket. The second stage is powered by two BE-3U engines, built by Blue Origin. It carries the payload into space and to its destination. While Blue Origin wants to re-use this stage in the future, it is currently expended (destroyed), most likely crashing into the ocean. The payload fairing is the lightweight shell that holds the cargo being sent to space. It is seven meters in diameter, which lets it hold larger objects. New Glenn is designed to launch satellites, cargo, and even people into space. When the rocket reaches space, the fairing splits apart and flies away into the atmosphere, where it melts apart. ==References== Category:Spacecraft",
