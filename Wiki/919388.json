 "text": "A frond is a large, divided leaf. The leaves of ferns are referred to as fronds. Some botanists only use this term for ferns. Other botanists also use the term 'frond' for the large leaves of cycads, as well as palms (Arecaceae) and various other flowering plants, such as mimosa or sumac. \"Frond\" is commonly used to identify a large, compound leaf. If the term is used for the leaves of ferns and algae, it can be applied to smaller and undivided leaves. == References == Category:Plant anatomy",
