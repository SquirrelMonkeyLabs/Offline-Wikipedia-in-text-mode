 "text": "TRAPPIST-1f, also known as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 f, is an exoplanet, potentially icy or likely rocky but under a massive water-steam gaseous envelope at very high pressure and temperature, orbiting within the habitable zone around the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 40 light-years (12 parsecs) away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. It was one of four new exoplanets to be discovered orbiting TRAPPIST-1 using observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The planet is a eyeball planet candidate. == References == Category:Exoplanets Category:TRAPPIST-1",
