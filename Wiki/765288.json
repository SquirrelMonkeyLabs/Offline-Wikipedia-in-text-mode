 "text": "Crab Rave is a song by Irish DJ and music producer Noisestorm. Canadian record label Monstercat released it on 1 April 2018. ==Internet meme== \"Crab Rave\" was released as a small April Fool's Day joke, although it soon became popular after becoming an Internet meme due to the music video's uplifting theme and dancing crabs. In an interview with Suzana Palyan of Billboard, O'Broin expressed his appreciation for its growing popularity, writing \"It's incredibly cool to see people enjoying it for the humour and video, as well as for the music itself. I really didn't anticipate the wave of new listeners and the plethora of memes based on the original; it's very fun to see the new creative variations being made every day.\" The music video was developed by O'Broin using the program Unreal Engine.
