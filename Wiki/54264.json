The Pegnitz has its source in the city of the same name at an altitude of 425 m and meets the Rednitz at 283 m northwest of Fürth. From that point on the river is called Regnitz. The Pegnitz is about 115 km long. ==Animal life== The river is inhabited by numerous ducks, swans, and gulls. ==Affluences== * Högenbach (creek) (left affluence from the Pommelsbrunn direction) * Röthenbach (creek) ==Cities on the Pegnitz== From source to mouth: * Pegnitz * Neuhaus on the Pegnitz * Hersbruck * Lauf an der Pegnitz * Röthenbach an der Pegnitz * Nuremberg: Within city limits (about 14 km), the river forms secondary arms. Numerous bridges and footbridges cross the river, such as the iron suspension bridge Kettensteg, dating from 1824. To the west of the Maxbrücke there is a weir. ==History== After the big flood in February 1909 the river was shortened by four kilometers within the Nuremberg city limits. Since 1996 planning and actions are progressing trying to lengthen the course of the river between Nuremberg and Fürth again and to shape it in a nature-oriented way. == Other websites == * http://www.bayern.de/wwa-n/stadtamfluss.htm - Wasserwirtschaftsamt Nürnberg: \"Die Umgestaltung der Pegnitz in Nürnberg\" (in German) Category:Rivers of Bavaria",
