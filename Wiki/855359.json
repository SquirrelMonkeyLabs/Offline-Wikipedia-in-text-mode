 "text": "Brett Sutton (born 16 May 1959) is an Australian triathlon coach and a former professional boxer, boxing coach, greyhound trainer, racehorse trainer and swimming coach, who is the head coach of Trisutto.com. Before setting up Trisutto.com, he was head coach of the triathlon team teamTBB. He has coached many World and Olympic champions, including Ironman world record holder Chrissie Wellington and Olympic champions Nicola Spirig and Emma Snowsill. He is known for his forthright views on training methods and strong criticism of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) and its officials. In 1999, he pleaded guilty in an Australian court to five sexual offences committed in the late 1980s against a teenage girl swimmer whom he was coaching. After the trial, in which he was given a suspended sentence, he was banned for life from coaching in Australia, and Sutton's marriage ended in divorce. Sutton later remarried, and is now based in Leysin, Switzerland, where he lives with his Swiss wife Fiona and their two daughters. He has been described as \"the coach with the most formidable résumé in triathlon\", \"widely recognised as one of the best triathlon coaches\", and \"widely considered to be the best and most unorthodox coach in the sport\". ==References== == Other websites == * * Official website of teamTBB Category:1959 births Category:Living people",
