 "text": "A pirate code is a code of conduct for pirates - a set of rules for how to behave. Some of these codes were used by real pirates; others are from movies. There was never a single pirate code that all pirates followed. Pirate codes changed from one captain to another. Sometimes they were different from one voyage (journey) to another. ==Historical articles of piracy== === Agreed-upon rules === In the second half of the 17th century, it became more common for pirates to follow agreed-upon sets of rules. These rules had many different names, including Chasse-Partie, Charter Party, Custom of the Coast, or Jamaica Discipline. Eventually, they became known as Articles of Agreement, or the pirate's code. These rules included punishments for rule breakers and said how much treasure each crew member would receive. On a pirate voyage, every crew member signed the articles (or if they could not write, they would make a mark to show they agreed). After the rules were signed, they were then posted in a common place, often the door of the grand cabin. Very few written pirate codes exist today. Before being caught, pirates often burned the papers so they could not be used as evidence against him. However, historians have found three sets of pirate codes. Several of these were published in Charles Johnson's book A General History of the Pyrates. Additionally, Alexandre Exquemelin, who probably sailed with Henry Morgan as ship's doctor, printed part of Morgan's pirate code in an account called The Buccaneers of America. === Bartholomew Roberts' articles === In 1720 Bartholomew Roberts, a famous Welsh pirate, wrote one of the most famous pirate codes in history. It said: > I. Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to the fresh > provisions [food], or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them > at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it > necessary, for the good of all, to vote [for rationing]. This first article gave all crew members an equal vote about issues on the ship. It also allowed crew members to have any food or drink they stole, unless there was not enough for everyone to have enough. > II. Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of prizes > because, (over and above their proper share) they were on these occasions > allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded the company to the value > of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money, marooning was their punishment. If > the robbery was only betwixt one another, they contented themselves with > slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not > in an uninhabited place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter > hardships. According to this part of the code, when the pirates stole money or treasure, every pirate should get a share. If one pirate took more than his fair share, he would be marooned: left on an island with no way to escape. If one pirate stole from another pirate, the guilty person would be punished by having his ears and nose cut; then he was left on shore. > III. No person to game at cards or dice for money. This article forbade crew members from gambling for money while playing cards or dice. > IV. The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night: if any > of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for drinking, they were > to do it on the open deck. This meant that crew members who wanted to drink alcohol after 8:00 PM had to do it on deck. > V. To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for service. This was a requirement for crew members to keep their weapons clean. > VI. No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to be found > seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea, disguised, he was to > suffer death; (so that when any fell into their hands, as it chanced in the > Onslow, they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences > from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel; but then here lies > the roguery; they contend who shall be sentinel, which happens generally to > one of the greatest bullies, who, to secure the lady's virtue, will let none > lie with her but himself.) This meant that no young boys or women were allowed to be crew members. If a crew member brought a woman to sea disguised as a man, he would be killed as punishment. > VII. To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished with death > or marooning. Desertion was considered a terrible crime. If a crew member ran away from battle, he was killed or left on an island. > VIII. No striking one another on board, but every man's quarrels to be ended > on shore, at sword and pistol. (The quarter-master of the ship, when the > parties will not come to any reconciliation, accompanies them on shore with > what assistance he thinks proper, and turns the disputant back to back, at > so many paces distance; at the word of command, they turn and fire > immediately, (or else the piece is knocked out of their hands). If both > miss, they come to their cutlasses, and then he is declared the victor who > draws the first blood.) This article forbade crew members from fighting on the ship. If they had to fight, they were required to do it on shore. They would start with a duel where both pirates tried to shoot each other. If both of them missed, they would fight with their swords. They were not allowed any help from other crew members in their fight. > IX. No man to talk of breaking up their way of living, till each had shared > one thousand pounds. If in order to this, any man should lose a limb, or > become a cripple in their service, he was to have eight hundred dollars, out > of the public stock, and for lesser hurts, proportionately. (This means that no crew member was allowed to leave the ship's crew until each member had 1000 pounds' share of plunder (stolen money or goods). If a crew member became seriously injured, he would be given 800 dollars.) > X. The captain and quartermaster to receive two shares of a prize: the > master, boatswain, and gunner, one share and a half, and other officers one > and quarter. This article set out the rules for pay on the ship. When the pirates captured money or goods, the captain and quartermaster would receive twice as much as regular pirates. The master, boatswain, and gunner received one and a half times as much as regular pirates. Other officers received one and a quarter times the regular pirate's share. > XI. The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day, but the other six days > and nights, none without special favour. Musicians played on board Bartholomew's ships, but they were not allowed to work on the Sabbath Day. === Captain John Phillips's articles === Captain John Phillips, captain of the Revenge, also set a code for his men in 1724: > I. Every Man Shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full Share > and a half of all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner shall > have one Share and quarter. This article commanded every pirate to obey the rules and orders of the Captain and other ship's officers. When Phillips' crew captured money or treasure, the Captain received one and a half times as much of it than the regular pirates did. The Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner received one and one quarter times as much than the regular pirates. > II. If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, > he shall be marooned with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one > small Arm, and Shot. This article sets marooning as the punishment for talking about running away from the ship or keeping a secret from the group. Marooned pirates were left on a deserted island with one bottle of water, a small gun, a bottle of gunpowder and one bullet, so he could shoot and kill himself if he wanted to. > III. If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value > of a Piece of Eight, he shall be marooned or shot. Marooning was also the punishment for taking anything from the ship that was worth more than a piece of eight (a Spanish dollar). > IV. If any time we shall meet another Marooner [pirate] that Man shall sign > his Articles without the Consent of our Company, shall suffer such > Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit. According to this article, if another pirate signed the ship's pirate code without the crew's consent, that pirate would be punished however the captain and crew chose. > V. That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, > shall receive Mosesâ€™s Law (that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare > Back. Pirates were discouraged from fighting with each other. If a pirate hit another, he would be whipped 39 times on his bare back. > VI. That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoke Tobacco in the Hold, without > a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shall > suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article. Fire was a constant danger on pirate ships. This article prohibited pirates from firing guns while not in battle (to avoid sparks); from smoking tobacco in the hold (where gunpowder was kept); and from carrying candles without a lantern. These things were dangerous because they could start fires on the ship or make the gunpowder on the ship explode. The punishment was whipping 39 times on the bare back. > VII. That Man shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or > neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other > Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit. If a pirate did not keep his weapons clean and ready for battle, or did not do his job, he would not get a share of any stolen money or goods. He could also be punished in any other way that the Captain and other pirates decided. > VIII. If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall have 400 > Pieces of Eight ; if a Limb, 800. A pirate who lost a joint in battle would be given 400 pieces of eight. A pirate who lost an arm or a leg would be given 800 pieces of eight. > IX. If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to > meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death. Any pirate who tried to rape a woman would be killed. ===Articles of Edward Low and George Lowther=== The Boston News-Letter, an old newspaper published in the 1700s, printed the following rules and said they were set by Captain Edward Low. The first eight of these articles are basically the same as the rules that Charles Johnson's book says Captain George Lowther used. Since Lowther and Low are known to have sailed together from about January 1, 1722 to May 28, 1722, they probably did use the same articles. Low's two extra articles were probably ordinance, or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated. > I. The Captain is to have two full Shares; the [quarter] Master is to have > one Share and one Half; The Doctor, Mate, Gunner and Boatswain, one Share > and one Quarter. II. He that shall be found guilty of taking up any Unlawful > Weapon on Board the Privateer or any other prize by us taken, so as to > Strike or Abuse one another in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the > Captain and the Majority of the Company shall see fit. (A pirate who was found guilty of taking a weapon onto the ship with the goal of hurting another pirate would be punished. The punishment would be voted on by the pirates, and would be whatever the Captain and most of the pirates decided.) > III. He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardice in the time of engagements, > shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company > shall think fit. (A pirate who was found guilty of being a coward - not being brave enough - during battle would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.) > IV. If any Gold, Jewels, Silver, &c.; be found on Board of any Prize or > Prizes to the value of a Piece of Eight, & the finder do not deliver it to > the Quarter Master in the space of 24 hours he shall suffer what Punishment > the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit. (If a pirate had any stolen money or goods that were worth more than a piece of eight, he had to give it to the Quarter-Master within 24 hours. If he did not, he would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.) > V. He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding one another to the value > of a Royal of Plate, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the > Majority of the Company shall think fit. (If a pirate was found guilty of gambling for money, or stealing money from another pirate, he would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.) > VI. He that shall have the Misfortune to loose a Limb in time of Engagement, > shall have the Sum of Six hundred pieces of Eight, and remain aboard as long > as he shall think fit. (If a pirate lost an arm or a leg during battle, he would be given 600 pieces of eight. The pirate could decide whether to stay on the ship or leave.) > VII. Good Quarters to be given when Craved. VIII. He that sees a Sail first, > shall have the best Pistol or Small Arm aboard of her. (The first pirate to see a ship that the pirates could attack would be given the best gun the pirates were able to steal from that ship.) > IX. He that shall be guilty of Drunkenness in time of Engagement shall > suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think > fit. (A pirate who was drunk during a battle would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.) > X. No snapping of Guns in the Hold. ==Pirate Code of Pirates of the Caribbean== In the Disney movie trilogy Pirates of the Caribbean, all the featured pirates are governed by a single Code. A codex containing the complete code is kept under the care of Captain Teague in Shipwreck Cove. While the Code has the force of law there, elsewhere it is treated more like a set of guidelines than a list of rules. ==Related pages== * Piracy in the Caribbean == References == * Really Bad Eggs: Pirates of the Caribbean * Pirate Articles of Capt.
