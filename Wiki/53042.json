 "text": "Soft drinks (also known as pop, soda, tonic, soda pop, fizzy drinks, or minerals) are \"fizzy\" drinks made from concentrates and sugar. When they are made, carbon dioxide gas is added which makes them \"fizzy\". This process is called carbonation. Some soft drinks have flavors. Some popular types of soda are Sprite, Mountain Dew, 7 Up, Pepsi, Dr Pepper and Coca-Cola. Most soft drinks are sweetened with sugar. That is what makes them so unhealthy. ==References==",
