The main character, Jack McKinley, finds a hidden organization on a secret island, and leads a mission to find seven magical orbs called \"loculi\". Throughout the books, Jack and his friends realize that they are in danger, and have to accept the challenge. == Books == === The Colossus Rises === The Colossus Rises is the first book in the series and was released on February 5, 2013. The day after thirteen-year-old Jack McKinley is told he has six months to live, he wakes up on a new and strange island, where a hidden group promises to save his life—with one condition. Jack and his three new friends: Aly Black, Cass Williams, and Marco Ramsay, must lead a mission to retrieve seven lost magical objects known as Loculi, which can save their lives only when put together correctly. The Loculi have been missing for a thousand years, lost in the destroyed Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. With no one else to help them and no way to escape, the four kids have to go on the quest. During the journey, they learn more about one another and the secret powers they have, but Jack has trouble finding out his own power. The first Wonder they visit is the Colossus of Rhodes, where they realize that there is way more than just themselves in danger when a mythical creature kidnaps Cass and an enemy organization, known as the Massa, threaten to get the Loculus before them. === Lost in Babylon === Lost in Babylon is the second book in the series and was released on October 9, 2013. After finding the first Loculus and winning the fight against the Colossus of Rhodes, Jack and his friends are in a worse condition than when they first set out. Marco has disappeared without any clues to show where he is gone. The first Loculus is also lost. With no time to lose and no one else to ask to help, Jack and the group have to follow the only clues they have and to head off to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. === The Tomb of Shadows === The Tomb of Shadows is the third book in the series and was released on May 13, 2014. With the ancient city of Babylon destroyed, Marco on the Massa side, and long-held secrets found, the Select don’t know who to trust or where to turn.

As their lives are in danger, the friends run to the next stop on their quest, the famous Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Here they have to fight their own demons and engage in a battle with the shadows of the dead. === The Curse of the King === The Curse of the King is the fourth book in the series and was released on March 3, 2015. Having already defeated the Colossus of Rhodes, hunted for the loculus in Ancient Babylon, and outsmarted legions of undead, the Select have recovered three of the lost Loculi hidden in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only to lose one of them to save a life. They must now find a way to save themselves from the power that will destroy them—and destroy the world. === The Legend of the Rift === The Legend of the Rift is the fifth and last book in the series, released on March 8, 2016. This story begins after King Uhla'ar steals Aly and pulled her back through a rift in time. A giant, angry monster guards the opening to the rift, and so Jack McKinley and his friends find out that rescuing Aly will be a lot harder than they thought. Their only hope is to rush to the last of the Ancient Wonders and find the rest of the lost Loculi. They go to the Temple of Artemis to fight off a mighty army before going to the Lighthouse of Alexandria where they a monster eats them. After escaping, they head back to Atlantis, to save themselves, the world, and Aly. == Reception == Publishers Weekly reviewed The Colossus Rises saying \"Lerangis, contributor to the 39 Clues series, has created a real 'page-turner', and while the characters are somewhat one-dimensional (like the adults), there’s a genuine sense of mystery and even a touch of grandeur to this tale\". Kirkus Reviews has called it \"a fast-paced, page-turning adventure\". == References == Category:Children's books Category:Children's literature Category:Mythology Category:Books",
