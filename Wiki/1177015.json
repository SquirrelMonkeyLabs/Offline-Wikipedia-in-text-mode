 "text": "\"The Lady in My Life\" is a song written by Rod Temperton, produced by Quincy Jones and performed by American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson, featured on his 1982 album Thriller. It's a smooth, romantic ballad that showcases Jackson's vocal abilities, emphasizing themes of love and devotion. The song has a gentle melody and heartfelt lyrics, making it one of the more intimate tracks on the album. == History == In 1981, Rod Temperton wrote the song Somethin' Special. In 1982, Jones asked Temperton to write a similar song for Jackson. Jackson, 23 and single, was uncomfortable during early recordings of the song due to the lyrics of the song, which he didn't relate at, but at Jones's suggestion that he sing it as if literally on his knees praying to someone, he asked for the lights to be turned down in the recording studio, similar to what he had done during the recording of She's Out of My Life for his previous album, Off the Wall (1979). The musicians accompanying Jackson on the piece were kept to a minimum, including Toto members David Paich and Steve Porcaro on synthesizers, and Jeff Porcaro on drums . The Lady in My Life was the last collaboration between Temperton and Jackson. The two would never work together again. == References ==",
