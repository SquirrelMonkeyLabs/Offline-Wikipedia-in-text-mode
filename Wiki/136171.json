 "text": "Queer as Folk is an American-Canadian drama television series that aired from 2000-2005 on Showtime. It is a remake of a British program with the same name. The series follows the lives of several gay men living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Due to the cost of making the series, it was actually filmed in Toronto, Canada. Following its first episode, the series quickly became the most-viewed program on the Showtime network in the United States, despite its somewhat controversial and graphic depictions of gay life. == Main cast (in alphabetical order) == Actor Character Michelle Clunie Melanie Marcus Robert Gant Ben Bruckner Thea Gill Lindsay Peterson Sharon Gless Debbie Novotny Gale Harold Brian Kinney Randy Harrison Justin Taylor Scott Lowell Theodore (Ted) Schmidt Peter Paige Emmett Honeycutt Hal Sparks Michael Novotny Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:2000 Canadian television series debuts Category:2005 Canadian television series endings Category:2000s American drama television series Category:American LGBT television programs Category:LGBT drama television series Category:Pittsburgh in fiction Category:English-language television programs",
