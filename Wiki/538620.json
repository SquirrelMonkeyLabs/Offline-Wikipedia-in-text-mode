Charlotte never married and as a result became a nun at a convent in Paris. ==Life== Born in Paris, she was the eldest daughter of Princess Louise Hippolyte of Monaco and her husband Prince Jacques I. Styled as \"Mademoiselle de Monaco\", she was known as either Charlotte or Thérèse Nathalie. Never marrying, she eventually took religious vows and became a nun at the Convent of Visitation in Paris on 21 January 1738. She remained unmarried, and died childless. She was once engaged to Frédéric Jules de La Tour d'Auvergne, \"Prince of Auvergne\". Yet, this proposed marriage did not come to be and before she was much older the engagement was broken off and Charlotte went to a convent to begin her education. She considered becoming a nun while there, wrestled with the decision but did finally take her vows as a sister of the Order of the Visitation. She did leave the convent a number of times to visit her family ==Other websites== ==References== Category:1719 births Category:1790 deaths Category:House of Grimaldi Category:Nuns",
