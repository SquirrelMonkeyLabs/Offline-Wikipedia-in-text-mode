 "text": "Joseph Brumm is an Australian animator, director and writer. He is on multiple British animated children's shows. Later, he created the Australian animated television series Bluey. ==Early life== Brumm was born in Winton in Central West Queensland, he was the second of three boys. His father worked for the Department of Primary Industries, while his mother was a librarian. After moving to Cairns when he was five years old, his family finally settled in the state's capital city of Brisbane when he was aged 12 where he began attending high school. He graduated from Marist College Ashgrove in 1995. After finishing high school, he studied animation at Griffith University and graduated in 1998 with a Bachelor of Animation (Honors). ==Career== After graduating university, Brumm relocated to London where he obtained work as an animator on several British series such as Charlie and Lola, Peppa Pig, Ben & Holly's Little Kingdom and Tinga Tinga Tales. Brumm returned to Brisbane in 2009 and established a small animation studio called Studio Joho with the intent of making an Australian version of Peppa Pig, swapping the pig characters with the Disney characters and changing the personality of the father figure. The show would be titled Bluey. Brumm decided the episodes of Bluey would centre around the two dog characters participating in play-based learning and creating their own adventures, creating a one-minute sample in 2016. Disney picked it up and helped Brumm expand the sample into a five- minute pilot. Brumm and his wife Suzy subsequently created the first season of six-minute shorts which were released in United States in 2015. The show has gone on to achieve commercial success and critical acclaim internationally. ===Other work=== In 2001, Brumm created an animated short called Causes, and he directed a 2015 short called The Meek. ==Awards== In October 2021, Brumm was named as Griffith University's Outstanding Alumnus and in June 2023, he was named as a Queensland Great. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Australian television producers Category:Australian television writers Category:Australian animators",
