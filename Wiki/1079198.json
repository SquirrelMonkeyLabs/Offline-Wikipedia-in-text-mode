 "text": "David Labang's bush frog (Philautus davidlabangi) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia in the Cardamon Mountains. People have seen it 859 meters above sea level in one place and between 165 and 330 meters above sea level in other places. The adult male frog is 20-21 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog has longer legs and more webbed skin than other frogs in Philautus. Scientists believe this frog hatches out of eggs as small frogs and never swims as a tadpole, but they are not sure. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, but human beings are cutting down its forests. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
