He was Secretary General of KANU, the former ruling political party. Ruto was a member of Parliament for Eldoret North Constituency between December 1997 and January 2013. He won the seat in the 1997 Kenyan election after defeating Reuben Chesire. Ruto was charged with crimes including murder by the International Criminal Court. The trial has been ongoing since 10 September 2013. The charges against him were dropped in 2016 due to lack of evidence by Fatou Bensouda. On 12 April 2022, Kenya Kwanza political coalition endorsed Ruto as its presidential candidate for 2022 elections. He would win the election with 50.5% of the vote, beating former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in August 2022. == References == Category:Vice presidents of Kenya Category:1966 births Category:People from Nairobi Category:Living people Category:Presidents of Kenya Category:Current national leaders",
