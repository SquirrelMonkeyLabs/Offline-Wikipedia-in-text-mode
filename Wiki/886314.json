 "text": "The second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt as the 32nd president of the United States happened on January 20, 1937. It was the start of the second term of Franklin D. Roosevelt as president and John Nance Garner as vice president. A public ceremony happened on the East Portico of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The event was the 38th presidential inauguration. This was the first inauguration to be held on January 20. This was because of the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which moved the beginning and end dates for the president and vice president from March 4 to January 20. This inauguration was also the first to have the vice president take the oath on the inaugural platform, rather than the Senate Chamber. The inauguration took place on a rainy day, with the crowds quickly leaving after it ended.The Forgotten Memoir of John Knox: A Year in the Life of a Supreme Court Clerk in FDR's Washington pages 165-167, by John Frush Knox, edited and published by Dennis J. Hutchinson and David J. Garrow, 2004. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes administered the oath of office to Roosevelt. Joseph Taylor Robinson administered the vice presidential oath of office to Garner. ==References== ==Other websites== *Video of FDR's second inauguration from British Pathe (via YouTube) *Text of Roosevelt's Second Inaugural Address *Audio of Roosevelt's Second Inaugural Address (via YouTube) Category:1930s in the United States Category:Franklin D.
