He was born in Berlin. He oversaw the newspaper's coverage of Watergate and resisted efforts by the paper's national reporters to take over the story. Though Post editor-in-chief Benjamin C. Bradlee gets most of the credit, managing editor Howard Simons and Rosenfeld worked most closely with reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on developing the story. Rosenfeld died on July 16, 2021, at his home in Slingerlands, New York from COVID-19 related problems, aged 91. ==References== ==Other websites== *Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
