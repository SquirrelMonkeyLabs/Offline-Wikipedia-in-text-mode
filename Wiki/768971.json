 "text": "The James W. Dalton Highway, usually called the Dalton Highway and signed as the Alaska Route 11, is a road in Alaska. It used to be called North Slope Haul Road, and some people still call it this. The road is long. It starts from the Elliott Highway just north of Fairbanks and travels north, ending near to the Arctic Ocean coast at Deadhorse. It follows the path next to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Many people think the highway is one of the most dangerous in the world. It was on one of the episodes of the BBC's programe World's Most Dangerous Roads. There are only three very small towns along the route: Coldfoot (population: 10), Wiseman (population: 22), and Deadhorse (population: 25). Prospect Creek and Galbraith Lake only have campers there, and nobody lives there.2008 edition of The Milepost, pp. 517-529 (Morris Communications Company) The road is made mostly of gravel. About of the road is paved. People who travel on the road are told to bring first aid kits and other items for survival, in case they have an emergency. ==References== Category:Arctic highways Category:Roads in Alaska",
