Wesson formed the partnership Smith & Wesson. After having financial troubles, in 1854 they sold the company to a shirt manufacturer named Oliver Winchester. In 1866, Winchester renamed the company Winchester Repeating Arms Company. That same year Smith and Wesson formed the second company called Smith & Wesson, which is still in operation. thumb|left|150px| In 1899, the company produced their now-famous Military & Police pistol. It was a double-action which set a standard for modern revolvers. It also introduced what has become a very popular caliber, the .38 S&W; Special. In 2005, the company introduced Smith & Wesson M&P; model pistol. It was the first polymer handgun for S&W.; It is available in 9mm and .40 S&W;, and as of February 2016, in .45 ACP. It is recoil-operated and uses the Browning-type locking system.
