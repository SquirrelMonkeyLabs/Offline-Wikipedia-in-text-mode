 "text": "Specific Gravity (SG) is a special case of relative density. It is defined as the ratio of the density of a given substance, to the density of water (H2O). Substances with a specific gravity greater than 1 are heavier than water, and those with a specific gravity of less than 1 are lighter than water. \\mbox{SG} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{substance}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H2O} } The density of the denominator, or reference, is \\rho_\\mathrm{H2O} = 1000kgm-3 (at 4°C/39.2°F) in SI units. SG is by definition dimensionless and therefore not dependent on the system of units used (e.g. slugsft−3 or kgm−3), assuming that the units are consistent. Based on the SG-value of a given substance, the density of that substance can be calculated. ==Related pages== * Buoyancy * Fluid mechanics * Relative density ==Other websites== * Specific Gravity Calculator ==References== * Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics Wiley, B.R.
