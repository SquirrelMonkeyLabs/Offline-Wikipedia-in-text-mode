The battle grid possesses varied elevations and is presented from a top-down isometric perspective. Witch characters possess \"song magic\", which they use in combat.

Players also have access to \"Free Time\", which they have use to speak to characters, partake in jobs in order to earn money, enhance the skills of witches via \"tuning\", or search the city for items. Partaking in these activities costs \"action points\", and players only have access to three action points to spend during each \"Free Time\" session. other activities, such as buying equipment and \"orbs\" for characters, do not cost action points. ==Scenario and story== Stella Glow takes place in a world with song-driven magic. This song magic brought prosperity to the world, but in turn, this prosperity also brought problems and war to the world. God then took song magic away from the people. Thousands of years later, song magic reappeared in the hands of five witches. One of these witches is Hilda, who wishes to crystallize the world and leads the Harbingers. Opposing her are the Regnant Knights and the four other witches. Alto is the main protagonist and a resident of Mithra, along with Lisette.
