 "text": "In calculus, an indeterminate form is an expression that has no single solution. There may be no solution, only one, or multiple depending on how the problem is looked at. Indeterminate forms tell us more analysis is needed to come to a conclusion. Indeterminate forms happen when the ratio of two functions gives a result that cannot be evaluated when taking the limit. However, these forms can happen with any operation, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation. Common indeterminate forms are 0/0, ∞/∞, 0 x ∞, ∞ - ∞, ∞0, 00, and 1∞. == References == Category:Mathematics",
