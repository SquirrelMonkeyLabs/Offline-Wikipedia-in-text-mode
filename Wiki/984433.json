 "text": "Chicken tikka is a dish which was originally from the Indian subcontinent. It started during the Mughal era. Today, it is popular in many countries. It usually consists of small pieces of roast chicken, with spices. It is similar to tandoori chicken, except that tandoori chicken also contains bones. There are versions of chicken tikka in Afgan, Persian and Turkish cuisine, but usually they are less spicy than the versions from the Indian subcontinent. Chicken tikka masala is a similar dish, but it has a sauce, and likely originated in Great Britain. Category:Pakistani food Category:Bangladeshi food Category:Indian food Category:Chicken as food",
