 "text": "Sclerorhynchoidei, the sawskates, is an extinct suborder of cartilaginous fish that had long rostra with large denticles similar to sawfishes and sawsharks. This feature was just convergent evolution and their closest living relatives are actually skates. The suborder contains five families, the Ganopristidae, Ischyrhizidae, Onchopristidae, Ptychotrygonidae, and Schizorhizidae. Some genera are not in any of these families. == Some genera == === Onchopristis === Onchopristis is an extinct genus of giant sclerorhynchoid. Isolated rostral denticles are the most common fossils, but rostra, chondrocrania, jaws, oral teeth, vertebrae, and dermal denticles were also found. === Baharipristis === Baharipristis is an extinct genus of sawskate from the Cretaceous period. === Onchosaurus === Onchosaurus is an extinct genus of ganopristid sawskate. === Schizorhiza === Schizorhiza is an extinct genus of Cretaceous schizorhizid. === Atlanticopristis === Atlanticopristis (meaning \"Atlantic saw\") is an extinct genus of Cretaceous ganopristid. == Related pages == * Balistoides * Balistes == References == # Herman, J.; Van Waes, H.
