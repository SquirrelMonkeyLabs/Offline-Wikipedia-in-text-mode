Mann personally visited every school in the state to inspect it. He later became the first president of Antioch College in Ohio. “Our means of education,” he stated, “are the grand machinery by which the ‘raw material’ of human nature can be worked up into inventors and discoverers, into skilled artisans and scientific farmers.” Category:1796 births Category:1859 deaths Category:Learning Category:19th-century American politicians",
