Gurmukhi was standardized by the 2nd Sikh Guru, Guru Angad Dev in the 16th century, it was modified from the Lahnda scripts, which were used to write the Punjabi, Sindhi in modern-day Pakistan. it is developed in the 6th century. There are 35 native characters in Gurmukhi, In the 18th-19th century a new character family called Naveen Toli was added. This helps to pronounce and write Persian words with proper tone.
