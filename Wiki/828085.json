 "text": "\"Road to Germany\" is the 3rd episode of Family Guys 7th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on October 19, 2008. The episode is about Mort Goldman in a time machine going to Warsaw, Poland in September 1939 (when Germany invaded Poland). Brian and Stewie must save Mort from danger. It was written by Patrick Meighan. Greg Colton is the director of the episode. == Story == Mort (the Griffin family's Jewish friend) goes to the Griffin family's house and needs to use bathroom. He thinks that Stewie's time machine is a bathroom and goes inside. The time machine takes Mort somewhere in the past. Mort can not go back to the present because he does not have a return pad (a machine that will take him back to the present). Brian and Stewie get a return pad and go to the past. They learn that Mort is at Warsaw on September 1, 1939, right before Poland is invaded and World War II starts. Mort is in a synagogue with his ancestors. Brian and Stewie's return pad does not work. They try to take Mort to England so he is safe from Nazis. German officers find them cross a border and go after them. Brian, Stewie, and Mort get in a motorbike to get away from the officers. They steal a U-boat and make it to England. The return pad does not have uranium to work. Brian says that the only place that has uranium is in a nuclear power plant in Berlin, Nazi Germany. They join the Royal Air Force and get in a dogfight with Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. They make it to the nuclear power plant in Berlin. Stewie makes himself look like Adolf Hitler so he can get uranium. They find the real Hitler, who wants them executed. They get the uranium needed for the return pad and makes it go to the present. They make it in Stewie's room 30 seconds before Mort first went in the time machine. Stewie kills the Mort that was in Germany by putting him in the time machine and destroying it with a raygun. The first Mort does not make it to the bathroom quick enough. == Production == \"Road to Germany\" was written by Patrick Meighan. Greg Colton is the director of the episode.
