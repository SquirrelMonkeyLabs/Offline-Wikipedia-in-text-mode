At age 101, she taught a weekly class in New York, and led programs across the globe. She was the author of two books, including her autobiography, Dancing Light: The Spiritual Side of Being Through the Eyes of a Modern Yoga Master, which won a 2016 IPPY Award and three 2016 International Book Awards. Deepak Chopra said: \"One of the most acclaimed yoga teachers of our century, Tao Porchon-Lynch... is a mentor to me who embodies the spirit of yoga and is an example of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind. Like yoga, she teaches us to let go and to have exquisite awareness in every moment.\" She was the recipient of India's Padma Shri in 2019 for her excellent work in the field of Yoga. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Educators from New York (state) Category:Writers from New York (state) Category:American autobiographers",
