 "text": "Alsodes igneus is a frog. It lives in Chile. ==Body== This frog has a short nose, a black stripe low on its face, no stripes on its legs, and no webbed skin on its feet. The iris of the eye is yellow-gold in color with black lines. ==Home== Scientists first saw the adult frogs near a small stream in a forest. Scientists saw it in two protected places: Tolhuaca National Park and in forest in the Universidad Austral de Chile. ==Young== Scientists saw tadpoles swimming in a stream near the adults. ==Threats== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Forest fires can kill this frog. Human beings also change the forests where the frog lives to make pine tree farms and eucalyptus tree farms. There is also less rain and it is hotter. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
