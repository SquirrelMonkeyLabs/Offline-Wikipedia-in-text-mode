 "text": "Reception theory is a theory proposed by Stuart Hall. Its main principal is that a text can have different meanings to different audiences. It is also called \"reader response theory\".Encyclopedia of Media and Communication, ed. Marcel Danesi (Toronto; Buffalo; London: University of Toronto Press, 2013), p. 574 The reader (or viewer) contributes to a text by interpreting it to what they think it says.Framing Friction: Media and Social Conflict, ed. Mary S. Mander (Urbana: University of Illinois Press 1999), p. 7 This interpretation, or understanding, is a product of the whole audience reading or viewing it, not just individuals. How an audience receives a text can sometimes be radically different from how it was intended to be received.Denise D. Bielby; C. Lee Harrington, Global TV: Exporting Television and Culture in the World Market (New York; London: New York University Press, 2008), p. 156 == References == Category:Communication Category:Literature Category:Social sciences",
