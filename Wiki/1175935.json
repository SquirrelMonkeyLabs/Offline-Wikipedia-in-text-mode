The stars that have collided with the Milky Way have a high elliptical orbit. The name \"Enceladus\" is from the mythological giant Enceladus, who was buried under Mount Etna and caused earthquakes. This former galaxy was buried in the Milky Way, == Parts == The globular clusters that used to be in this dwarf galaxy are Messier 2, Messier 56, Messier 75, Messier 79, NGC 1851, and NGC 5286. == Related pages == * Omega Centauri * M32p, a large galaxy that collided with the Andromeda Galaxy * Kraken Galaxy, another proposed large galaxy merged into the Milky way but earlier than the \"Gaia Sausage\" Category:Milky Way Category:Dwarf galaxies",
