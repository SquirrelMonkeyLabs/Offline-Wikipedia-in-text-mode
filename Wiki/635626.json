 "text": "Rösti () or röschti is a Swiss potato dish. It was originally a common breakfast eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern, but is now eaten all over Switzerland. Many Swiss people consider rösti a national dish. Today it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes, rather than for breakfast. It is sometimes considered unhealthy because of the amount of butter or oil used. Category:Potato dishes Category:Swiss food Category:Fried foods Category:Canton of Bern",
