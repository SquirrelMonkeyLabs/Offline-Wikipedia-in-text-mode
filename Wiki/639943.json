 "text": "The 2017–18 UEFA Europa League was the 47th season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 9th season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. The last game was played at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu, France. Atlético Madrid won against Marseille to win their third Europa League title. As winners, Atlético Madrid played against the winners of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. They also automatically qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage, but since they had already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the third-placed team of the 2017–18 Ligue 1. Manchester United qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League as winners of the Europa League. They were unable to defend their title as they qualified for the Champions League knockout phase. ==Teams== The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: *CW: Cup winners *2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, etc.: League position *LC: League Cup winners *RW: Regular season winners *PW: End-of-season European competition play-offs winners *UCL: Transferred from the Champions League **GS: Third-placed teams from the group stage **PO: Losers from the play-off round **Q3: Losers from the third qualifying round Round of 32 Round of 32 Round of 32 Round of 32 CSKA Moscow Atlético Madrid Spartak Moscow RB Leipzig Celtic Sporting CP Napoli Borussia Dortmund Group stage Group stage Group stage Group stage Villarreal Vitória de Guimarães Lugano İstanbul Başakşehir Real Sociedad Lyon Fastav Zlín Young Boys 1\\.
