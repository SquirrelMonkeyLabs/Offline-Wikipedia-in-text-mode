 "text": "Raoult's law states that the vapour pressure of a binary solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly related to the mole fraction of solvent (i.e. volatile) in the solution. Also, it states that the vapour pressure of each component in a binary solution containing volatile components is directly related to its respective mole fraction in the solution. Relative going-down of vapour pressure is equal to mole fraction of non volatile and non- electrolytic solute. This is known as Raoult's law.
