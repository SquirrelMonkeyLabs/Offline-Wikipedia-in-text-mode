 "text": "Air hockey is a tabletop game where two opposing players try to score goals using a small plastic hockey puck. The table is usually low-friction. Players use a small plastic \"mallet\" to both push the puck, and defend their goals from the puck. Air hockey was created by a group of Brunswick Billiards employees from 1969 to 1972. ==References== Category:Games Category:Sports Category:Entertainment",
