 "text": "There are two types of Japanese traditional dance: Odori, which was created in the Edo period; and Mai, which was created in the western part of Japan. Odori came from Kabuki drama, where it is danced by men. Mai derives from Noh drama, also danced by men. Today it is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done in houses, instead of on stage. A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the Kyomai or Kyoto style dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. Noh drama, music and dance was heavily influenced by the elegance of the manners of the Japanese Imperial Court. Kabuki drama, and hence Odori, was a more democratic form, but still (viewed with modern eyes) quite traditional. Category:Japanese culture Category:Dance types",
