She was a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world – the first woman to obtain a doctorate (in the modern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in Northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Cooke, Roger (1984).The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya (Springer-Verlag) * Kennedy, Don H.
