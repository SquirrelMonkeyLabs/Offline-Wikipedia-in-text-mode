 "text": "Klingons (; Pronunciation: /ˈt͡ɬɪŋɑn/) are a warrior race and major antagonists in the fictional Star Trek universe. They were in the show Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS) many times and were in all five spin-off television series afterwards. They were one of the main enemies of the United Federation of Planets, but eventually they became partners. Made by writer Gene Coon, Klingons were introduced in the episode \"Errand of Mercy\" (1967). They were named for Lieutenant Wilbur Clingan, who served with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in the Los Angeles Police Department. In the first series, the conflict between the Federation and Klingon was supposed to be referring to the then-current Cold War unfriendliness between the United States and the Soviet Union. Star Trek: The Next Generation continued to have the Klingon as a group similar to the army but they made the Klingon fighter follow rules similar to bushido, military Japanese rules for behavior valuing honor above life. == Sources == Category:Star Trek species",
