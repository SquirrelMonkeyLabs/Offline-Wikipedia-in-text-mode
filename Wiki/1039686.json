It was developed by Mojang Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios for mobile phones. == Gameplay == Like Minecraft, Minecraft Earth was a game focused on building, gathering, crafting and exploring. It used the same Bedrock game engine as some versions of Minecraft. In “build mode” players could build on “buildplates” with other people, they could then explore them in “play mode”. == Why it was cancelled == On 5 January 2021, developer Mojang Studios announced that they were releasing the final build of Minecraft Earth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They shut down the game on 30 June 2021. == Related pages == * Minecraft * Minecraft Dungeons == References == # Wilbot, Carrie (10 October 2019). \"Minecraft Earth needed \"two-and-a-half miracles\" to get tech working\". pcgamesn.com.
