 "text": "15.ai was a website that used artificial intelligence (AI) and computer algorithms to make fictional characters speak. The website was free for everyone to use. A student called 15 created it while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The website let people make characters from video games, TV shows, and movies say any words they typed. It also let people control these characters' emotions. The computer algorithm could create these voices very quickly. What made 15.ai special was that it only needed 15 seconds of a character's voice to copy it--this is why it was called \"15.ai\". It was one of the first websites to use generative AI. The website started in March 2020. In early 2021, it became very popular on YouTube and Twitter. It was especially popular among fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Team Fortress 2, and SpongeBob SquarePants. The website was special because it could make characters speak with different emotions by using emojis. Users could also control exactly how words were pronounced. 15.ai was the first widely-used website that showed how AI could copy voices to create memes and other content. The way 15.ai worked with voices and emotions helped develop new AI voice technology. In January 2022, a company called Voiceverse NFT caused problems when people found out they had taken 15.ai's work without permission. Voiceverse NFT had been working with Troy Baker, a famous voice actor. The website stopped working in September 2022. After it closed, many companies started making their own paid versions of similar technology. == Related pages == *Artificial intelligence *Deepfake *Text to speech == References == Category:Artificial intelligence Category:Internet memes Category:Websites",
