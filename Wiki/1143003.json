 "text": "In Nevada, abortion is legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After 24 weeks, it is allowed if the pregnancy could be dangerous for the person. Since 2007, the law requires doctors to make sure people understand the decision before having an abortion. Nevada has rules that limit the use of public money for abortions. There is also a rule that says a parent or legal guardian must be told if a person under 18 years old wants to have an abortion. Most people in Nevada support abortion rights, including Republicans. == References == Category:U.S. abortion laws by state Category:Abortion in the United States",
