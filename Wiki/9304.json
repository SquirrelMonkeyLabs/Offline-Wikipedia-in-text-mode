 "text": "The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs) are fictional little blue beings created by Peyo, a Belgian cartoonist. They first appeared in 1958, and later in a cartoon television show created by Hanna-Barbera Productions in the 1980s. On September 12, 1981, they were featured on ABC on Saturday mornings as a cartoon series.Nelson George, Post-Soul Nation: The Explosive, Contradictory, Triumphant, and Tragic 1980s (New York: Penguin, 2005), p. 40 The little blue creatures from Belgium became popular among all ages. A feature movie called The Smurfs was released in 2011. The Smurfs 2 was a sequel released July 31, 2013. == Description == The smurfs are very small. In cartoons in which they appear with humans, they are small enough to stand on a human hand. Most Smurfs are male. There are only 3 females in the village: Smurfette, Sassette Smurfling, and Nanny Smurf. Most Smurfs wear white pants and white Phrygian caps. Papa Smurf, Grandpa Smurf, and some of the Smurflings dress differently. Grandpa Smurf wears yellow clothes and Papa Smurf wears red clothes. The Smurflings are Sassette, Snappy, Slouchy, and Nat. Sassette and Nat do not dress like the other Smurfs at all, while Slouchy and Nat do dress like the others. In some comics, the Smurfs dress differently in color or clothing. Smurfs live in mushroom-shaped houses in a village in a forest. ==Characters== * Smurfette, one of the female Smurfs * Papa Smurf, the village leader * Brainy Smurf, an intellectual show-off * Vanity Smurf, is a narcissist.
