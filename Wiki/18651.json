 "text": "Jefferson City is the capital of the U.S. state of Missouri. It is also county seat of Cole County. (The Jefferson City metropolitan area includes Callaway, Cole, Moniteau, and Osage counties.) As of the 2020 census, the population was 43,228. Jefferson City was named after Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. Jefferson City is near the center of Missouri, a region known as Mid-Missouri. It is on the northern edge of the Ozark Plateau on the southern side of the Missouri River. It is at the western edge of the Missouri Rhineland, one of the major wine-producing regions of the Midwest. ==History== In pre-Columbian times, this region was home of an ancient people known only as the Mound Builders. By the time European settlers began arriving, the Mound Builders had vanished into history. The contemporary indigenous peoples were called the Osage Indians. When the Missouri Territory was organized in 1812, St. Louis was the seat of government. St. Charles next served as the capital. The new state legislature decided to build a new capital city in the middle of the state in 1821. They named it after Thomas Jefferson, who was still alive. A village was already there called Lohman's Landing.McMillen, Margot Ford & Murphy, Dennis. A to Z: The Dictionary of Missouri Place Names. Columbia, MO. Pebble Publishing, 1996. . For years the village was little more than a trading post located in the wilderness about midway between St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1826 the Missouri legislature first met here and in 1839 the settlement was incorporated as a city. Jefferson City was selected as the site for a state prison and, in 1836, the Missouri State Penitentiary was opened. The prison was home to a number of infamous Americans, including: former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, assassin James Earl Ray, and bank robber Charles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd. During the American Civil War, Jefferson City was occupied by Union troops. Many of the people in the state supported the Union, although Missouri's Little Dixie section along the river in western counties was strongly Confederate. German immigrants created vineyards in small towns on either side of the Missouri River, especially on the north from Jefferson City east to Marthasville outside St. Louis. This area is known as the Missouri Rhineland after the Rhineland in Germany. It has grown as an agricultural and tourist economy. ==Geography== Jefferson City is located at (38.572954, -92.189283).

Columbia College, Linn State Technical College, William Woods University, Metro Business College, and Merrell University also have locations in Jefferson City with varying degree levels and options. ==Transportation== Jefftran operates a public bus system year- round. Jefferson City is one of four state capitols in United States that are not served by an interstate highway.Pierre, South Dakota; Dover, Delaware; and Juneau, Alaska are the other four state capitals without interstate highways. Only four other state capitols nationwide share in this oddity. Interstate 70 passes by the city to the north, in Columbia.
