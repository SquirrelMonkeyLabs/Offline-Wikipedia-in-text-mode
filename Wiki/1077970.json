He first appeared in Mister Miracle #1. (1971) The three characters who have been Mister Miracle are Thaddeus Brown, Scott Free, and Shilo Norman. == Fictional character biographies == === Thaddeus Brown === He was an extraordinary circus escape artist, and the first person to take up the name of the character. He worked with an assistant, Oberon, and mentored the young Shilo Norman, who would later become the third person to take up the \"Miracle\" guise. Most notably, shortly before his own death at the hands of an Intergang operative, Brown also mentored New God Scott Free. Scott Free was inspired to take up Brown's stage name to avenge his death, and became the very first crimefighter known as Mister Miracle. After avenging his death, Scott Free hired Oberon and took up Brown's business to carry on his name. === Scott Free === He is the god of escape in the New Gods mythology. A Genesisian raised on Apokolips, he defected with his lover Big Barda to Earth, where he used the skills he learned in escapology both as a performance artist and in the Justice League of America. === Shilo Norman === He is a young African- American man who studied escapology underneath Brown as his ward from an early age.
