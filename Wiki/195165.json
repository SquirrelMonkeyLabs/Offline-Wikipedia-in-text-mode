 "text": "Sic is a Latin word meaning \"thus\", \"so\", \"as such\", or \"in such a manner\". In writing, it is put in square brackets and italic type – [sic] – to show that any incorrect or unusual spelling, phrases, punctuation, or other quoted material have been copied verbatim (word for word) from its original source. At first, it was said like the English word \"seek\" (IPA /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word \"sick\" (/'sɪk/). == Usage == The word sic may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully: for instance, quoting the U.S. Constitution: :\"The House of Representatives shall chuse [sic] their Speaker...\" It is often used, though, to highlight an error, sometimes to ridicule, such as here in The Times: :Warehouse has been around for 30 years and has 263 stores, suggesting a large fan base. The chain sums up its appeal thus: \"styley [sic], confident, sexy, glamorous, edgy, clean and individual, with it's [sic] finger on the fashion pulse.\" Sometimes, sic is said to be an abbreviation for \"said in context\", \"spelled in context\", \"said in copy\", and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used. == References == Category:Latin phrases",
