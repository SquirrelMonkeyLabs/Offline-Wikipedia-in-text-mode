 "text": "We Shall Overcome is an album of folk music recorded and released by Bernie Sanders in 1987. It was done when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont. The album has since been released on iTunes and has attained a new wave of popularity as a result of Sanders' ongoing presidential campaign. ==Background== In 1987, Burlington-based musician Todd Lockwood was sipping coffee at Leunig's Bistro when he came up with the idea to ask the city's mayor, Bernie Sanders, to record a musical project at his studio, White Crow Audio. Lockwood called the mayor's office and left Sanders a message with a secretary. Sanders later called back to set up a meeting, where he told Lockwood \"I have to admit to you this appeals to my ego.\" Sanders made a list of ten songs he would be willing to record, five of which made the cut for the album. ==List of songs== ==References== ==Other websites== * Video of Bernie Sanders singing 'This Land Is Your Land' at YouTube.com Category:1987 albums Category:Bernie Sanders Category:Folk albums",
