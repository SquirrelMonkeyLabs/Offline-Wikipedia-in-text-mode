 "text": "Jill Sobule (January 16, 1959 â€“ May 1, 2025) was an American singer-songwriter best known for the 1995 single \"I Kissed a Girl\", and \"Supermodel\" from the soundtrack of the 1995 film Clueless. Her folk-inflected compositions alternate between ironic, story-driven character studies and emotive ballads, a duality reminiscent of such 1970s American songwriters as Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson, Loudon Wainwright III, Harry Chapin, and Randy Newman. Autobiographical elements, including Sobule's Jewish heritage and her adolescent battles with anorexia and depression, frequently occur in Sobule's writing.
