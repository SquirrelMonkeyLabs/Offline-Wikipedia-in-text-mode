Retrieved January 20, 2021. Former Republican president Donald Trump, voters and several members of the Democratic Party showed concern about his age, including his cognitive health. These issues became more talked about during and after the 2020 United States presidential election. These concerns became a bigger issue after a poor performance by Biden during a debate against Trump in the 2024 presidential election. This led a many commentators and some Democratic lawmakers to pressure Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. After the debate, it was reported that a neurologist specializing in Parkinson's disease had visited the White House eight times in the previous eight months. Biden later ended his candidacy while saying that he would continue serving as president until the end of his term. In 2018, when Biden was thinking running for president, he talked with friends, aides, and longtime supporters and asked if he was too old to run for the presidency. By 2019, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Politico, CNN, The Atlantic, the Associated Press, and Slate all published articles on Biden's age and if he was healthy enough to run for office. That year, many of the people running against him for the Democratic nomination used his age against Biden, who was 76 at the time. In January 2024, a doctor gave Biden a close to 75% chance of living through a second term based on publicly available information about his health. This is about a 10% better survival chance when compared to other men his age. In a February 2024 poll, Biden's age and health were major issues for 86% of voters generally, up from 76% earlier in 2020. According to another 2024 poll, most of those who voted for Biden in 2020 say they believe he is too old to be a good president. After finishing the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents, a special counsel said that Biden would be able to show himself to a jury as an \"elderly man with poor memory\" and wrote that Biden had some memory problems. While criticizing the counsel's statement during the conference, Biden accidentally called the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as President of Mexico. On July 17, 2024, Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He had mild symptoms, including a cough and a runny nose. Pictures of him looking sick while leaving from Air Force One on the way to isolation in Delaware had people expressing more concern about Biden's health. ==References== Category:Joe Biden Category:2020 United States presidential election Category:2024 United States presidential election",
