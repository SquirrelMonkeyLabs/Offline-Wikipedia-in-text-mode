 "text": "Neville Longbottom is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter book series. He is described as a round-faced Gryffindor student in the central character Harry Potter's year. Throughout the series, Neville is often portrayed as a bumbling and disorganised character, as well as a rather mediocre studentâ€” though he is highly gifted at herbology. However, the character's personality appears to undergo a transition after he joins Dumbledore's Army in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The encouragement he receives gives him confidence in his magical abilities, turning him into a more competent wizard. Eventually, Neville becomes the leader of Dumbledore's Army during Harry, Ron and Hermione's absence searching for Horcruxes. Neville is instrumental in the downfall of Lord Voldemort and eventually destroys the final horcrux, which allows Harry to defeat The Dark Lord once and for all. Neville is portrayed in the movie adaptations by Matthew Lewis. ==References== Category:Harry Potter characters",
