 "text": "The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple is one of the four Inns of Court around the Royal Courts of Justice in London. They may call members to the Bar and allow them to practice as barristers. (The other Inns are Middle Temple, Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn.) The Inner Temple was first recorded as being used for legal purposes when lawyers' houses were burned down in Wat Tyler's revolt in 1381. Before that date, the Temple was occupied by the Knights Templar. The Inner Temple was damaged during the wartime bombings in the areas surrounding the River Thames. ==Famous members== *Geoffrey Chaucer (reputed) *Thomas de Littleton *William Catesby *Sir Edward Coke *Sir Francis Drake *Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester *Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex *Christopher Hatton *Thomas Morton, a member of the associated Inn of Chancery Clifford's Inn *William Wycherly *Judge Jeffreys *James Boswell *Samuel Johnson (resided at the Inner Temple for a period, though not a member) *William Paca *Karl Pearson, and his father William Pearson, QC *George Phillippo *Thomas Hughes *William Schwenk Gilbert *Bram Stoker *Mohandas Gandhi (called 1891, disbarred 1922, reinstated 1988) *John Maynard Keynes *Clement Attlee *Jawaharlal Nehru *Mohammed Ali Jinnah *Cecil Rhodes *Ivy Williams, the first female barrister *A.J.P.
