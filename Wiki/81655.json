 "text": "The inner moons of Jupiter are four small moons that orbit close to Jupiter. These moons are closely interconnected with the rings of Jupiter and serve as both sources and sinks of the ring's material. Their semi-major axes range between 128,000 and 222,000 km. The members of the group are (in order from closest to farthest): * Metis * Adrastea * Amalthea, the biggest, after which the group is sometimes named * Thebe Metis and Adrastea each orbit Jupiter in less than one Jovian day (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate once). Phobos, a moon of Mars, is the only other moon known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. ==Gallery of images== Image:Metis.jpg|Image of Metis taken by the Galileo spacecraft Image:Adrastea.jpg|Galileo image of Adrastea Image:Amalthea PIA02532.png|Images of Amalthea taken from the Galileo spacecraft Image:thebe.jpg|Image of Thebe taken by the Galileo spacecraft ==Related pages== *List of Jupiter's moons ==References== Category:Jupiter's moons",
