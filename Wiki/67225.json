In modern use, it includes anything that can be recognized easily, such as a monument, building, or other structure. In American English it is the main word used to call places that are tourist attractions because they are beautiful, or big, or they have historical importance. Some, such as National Landmarks, are on official lists of landmarks. Landmarks in the British English are normally used for casual navigation, such as giving directions to someone to get somewhere. This is done in American English as well. ==List of important landmarks== Landmarks also can be of two different categories: natural (e.g., physical features such as waterfalls and mountains), and structures constructed by humans. Many of them are World Heritage Sites. Some important landmarks across the world today include: ===Natural phenomena=== * Amazon Rainforest, Brazil/Peru / *Angel Falls, Canaima National Park, Gran Sabana, Bolivar State, Venezuela *Cotton Tree, Freetown, Sierra Leone *The Cliffs of Moher, Co.
