 "text": "SCP – Containment Breach is a horror video game created by Joonas \"Regalis\" Rikkonen, based on fictional stories from the SCP Foundation wiki. The player is a human test subject, imprisoned in an underground testing facility which is used for containing and studying entities known as SCPs. The goal of the game is to escape from the facility during a breach of these anomalies while also avoiding security teams that are sent in to contain them. The game's map is randomly generated, and features multiple entities from the SCP wiki. The game was released on April 15, 2012, and was supported with digital content updates until its most recent update 1.3.11 on July 29, 2018. == Gameplay == The player controls a prisoner named D-9341 as they attempt to escape an underground research facility during a breach of its contained entities, known as SCPs. During gameplay, the player walks around the facility collecting items in order to escape, while also being chased by multiple SCPs and armed guards, which must be avoided or else the player will be hurt or killed. The game is set in a first-person perspective with the player in full control of D-9341, and is able to walk and sprint in any direction. Sprinting too long causes the player’s sprint meter to empty, and they must wait for it to recharge. One of the important game mechanics is the blink meter. During the entire gameplay, the blink meter will slowly decrease and eventually force the player to blink, but the player can also blink by pressing the space bar. This mechanic is in the game because of SCP-173, who moves and attacks based on whether or not the player can see them. The player can save and load games depending on difficulty, with the game's medium difficulty only allowing saving at certain points in the game, and the game's hardest difficulty not allowing saving at all.
