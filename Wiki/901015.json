 "text": "The Grand Divisions are three regions in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Each contains about one-third of the state's land area. Each is geographically, culturally, legally, and economically distinct. The Grand Divisions are legally recognized in the state constitution and state law and are represented on the Flag of Tennessee by the flag's three prominent stars. ==Borders== The border between East Tennessee and Middle Tennessee is on the Cumberland Plateau. It was a major barrier to travel during much of the state's early history. It is close to the line between the Eastern and Central time zones. All but three counties of East Tennessee (Bledsoe, Cumberland, and Marion) are in the Eastern Time Zone. Middle and West Tennessee are entirely in the Central Time Zone. The reach of the Tennessee River that flows northward to Kentucky from Mississippi and Alabama marks the border between Middle and West Tennessee starting from the northern border of Hardin County. It is split down the middle by the Tennessee River but is located wholly in West Tennessee. ==Population== Grand Division Population (2020 census) Largest city Area in mi2 (km2) Counties East Tennessee 2,470,105 Knoxville 33 Middle Tennessee 2,883,086 Nashville 41 West Tennessee 1,557,649 Memphis 21 State of Tennessee 6,910,840 Nashville 41,217 (106,751) 95 (list) ==References== Category:Geography of Tennessee",
