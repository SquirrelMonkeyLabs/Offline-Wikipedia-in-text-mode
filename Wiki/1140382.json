 "text": "Edenopteron is an extinct genus of tristichopterids from the Devonian of what is now Australia. It is known from one single species, E. keithcrooki. == Etymology == The name Edenopteron is named after the town of Eden. == Description == Edenopteron was a large member of the Tristichopteridae, reaching about 3 metres (9.8 ft) long. The endoskeleton lacks a lot of ossification. The skull is 30 cm (12 in) long. It resembles Eusthenodon, but is distinguished by longer proportions of the parietal compared to the post- parietal shield. == Gallery == File:Edenopteron keithcrooki.tif|Model of Edenopteron File:1-1 scale model (WIP) of Edenopteron, based on the research of Dr Gavin Young with the field and lab assistance of Bob Dunstone, Ben Young & Tim Senden.jpg|Reconstruction File:Skull and shoulder-girdle restorations of Tristichopterids.jpg|Skull and shoulder-girdle restorations of the tristichopterids: A, B, C, Edenopteron; D, Eusthenodon E, Cabonnichthys; F, Mandageria == References == Category:Lobe-finned fish Category:Extinct fish Category:Devonian Category:Fish of Australia Category:Animals of Australia",
