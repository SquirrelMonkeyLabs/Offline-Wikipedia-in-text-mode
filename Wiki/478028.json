Some of his work had controversy because he tried to prove that Anglo-Saxons were superior to other people. == Life == Robert Knox was born in Edinburgh's North Richmond Street to Mary and Robert Knox. His father was a teacher of mathematics and philosophy. He had smallpox as an infant, which blinded his left eye and changed his face. He was educated at the Royal High School, where he bullied his friends. In 1810, he joined medical classes in Edinburgh. He became interested in transcendentalism. Knox graduated from Edinburgh University in 1814. Knox married his wife Susan in 1824. ==References== ==Other websites== *Robert Knox MD, FRCSEd, FRSEd 1791–1862: The first Conservator of the College Museum The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Historical Review, 2000.
