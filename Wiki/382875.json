The work hangs in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. They write: \"Wind from the Sea is an iconic example of Wyeth's landscapes, as well as one of the earliest examples of his use of windows and his often unique choice of vantage point. Three preparatory studies for the painting accompanied the gift. All four works were bequeathed to the Gallery by Charles H. Morgan.Wind from the Sea is the second painting by Wyeth to enter the National Gallery's collection; Snow Flurries, a 1953 tempera painting, was given in 1977.\" == References == Category:1940s paintings Category:Paintings in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC Category:American paintings Category:1947 works",
