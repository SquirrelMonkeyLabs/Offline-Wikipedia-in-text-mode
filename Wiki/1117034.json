 "text": "The katal (symbol: kat) is the SI unit of catalytic activity. It quantifies the rate at which a catalyst (such as an enzyme) converts reactants in a chemical reaction. One katal is the catalytic activity that raises the rate of conversion by one mole per second. The katal has various SI multiples. These range from femtokatal (fkat), which is 10-15 katals, to megakatal (Mkat), which is 103 katals. Since the katal is quite large for most enzymatic reactions, the nanokatal (nkat) is commonly used in practice. Category:SI units",
