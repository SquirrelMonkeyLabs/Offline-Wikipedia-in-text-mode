 "text": "A course is a set of food items served together during a meal, all at the same time. A course may include multiple dishes including side dishes or only one, and often includes items with some variety of flavors. A hamburger served with French fries would be considered a single course and might constitute the entire meal. Larger meals might include many courses, such as a course where a soup is served by itself, a course when cordon bleu is served at the same time as a side dish of vegetables, and finally a dessert such as a pumpkin pie. Courses may vary in size as well as number depending on the culture where the meal takes place. When dishes are served mostly in a single course, this is known in formal terms as service à la française; when dishes are served mostly in separate courses, this is called service à la russe. ==References== Category:Meals",
