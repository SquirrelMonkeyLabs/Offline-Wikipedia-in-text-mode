 "text": "Rod J. Rosenstein (; born January 13, 1965) is an American attorney who served as the 37th United States deputy attorney general from 2017 to 2019. Prior to his appointment, he served as a United States attorney for the District of Maryland. At the time of his confirmation as deputy attorney general in April 2017, he was the longest-serving U.S. attorney. Rosenstein had also been nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in 2007, but his nomination was never considered by the U.S. Senate. President Donald Trump nominated Rosenstein to serve as Deputy Attorney General on February 1, 2017. Rosenstein was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 25, 2017. In May 2017, at Trump's behest, he authored a memo that Trump then cited as the basis for his decision to dismiss FBI Director James Comey. In May 2018, Rosenstein reportedly told the five U.S. Attorneys in districts along the border with Mexico, where refugees were concerned, that they should not \"be categorically declining immigration prosecutions of adults in family units because of the age of a child.\" The directive, issued as part of the Trump administration family separation policy, led to the separation of thousands of small children from their parents, many of whom were seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing violence in Central America. Following the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Comey's dismissal, Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the myriad links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies and related matters. Rosenstein previously assumed authority over the parallel FBI probe after Sessions recused himself over misleading remarks he made to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary during his confirmation process. The New York Times reported Rosenstein prevented the FBI and Mueller from investigating Trump's personal and financial dealings in Russia. On November 7, 2018, Trump transferred this oversight to acting United States Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Following the resignation of Jeff Sessions as United States Attorney General at the request of President Donald Trump, Rosenstein also served as acting United States Attorney General in his capacity as United States Deputy Attorney General for a few hours on November 7, 2018 until Trump signed an executive order naming Matthew Whitaker as acting United States Attorney General later that day. Rosenstein submitted his resignation as deputy attorney general on April 29, 2019, which took effect on May 11, 2019. In 2020, he joined the law firm King & Spalding as a partner in its \"Special Matters and Government Investigations\" practice. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from Philadelphia Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Jewish American politicians Category:Jewish lawyers Category:Politicians from Maryland Category:Politicians from Philadelphia Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:United States Deputy Attorneys General Category:Lawyers from Maryland",
