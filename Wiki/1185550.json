 "text": "The 2008 Canadian federal election was held on October 14, 2008, to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 40th Canadian Parliament after the previous parliament had been dissolved by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on September 7, 2008. The election resulted in a second but stronger minority government for Harper's Conservatives. While they were a dozen seats away from a majority government, the Liberal Party led by Stéphane Dion lost 18 seats as the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois made some gains. Following the election, the Liberals and New Democrats tried to form a coalition government and topple the Conservatives from power, but were unsuccessful in doing so. ==Results== Elections to the 40th Canadian Parliament (2008) Party Leader Candidates Votes Seats # ± % Change (pp) 2006 2008 ± G L Stephen Harper 307 5,209,069 165,002 37.65 124 19 25 6 Stéphane Dion 307 3,633,185 846,230 26.26 103 26 5 31 Jack Layton 308 2,515,288 74,309 18.18 29 8 11 3 Gilles Duceppe 75 1,379,991 173,210 9.98 51 2 1 3 Elizabeth May 303 937,613 273,545 6.78 71 94,844 12,984 0.69 1 1 1 – Ron Gray 59 26,475 1,677 0.19 – Anna Di Carlo 59 8,565 415 0.06 – Dennis Young 26 7,300 4,298 0.05 0.03 Sinclair Stevens 10 5,860 8,291 0.04 -0.05 Miguel Figueroa 24 3,572 550 0.03 0.01 Connie Fogal 20 3,455 2,647 0.02 -0.02 Blair Longley 8 2,298 6,873 0.02 -0.05 François Gourd 7 2,122 2,122 0.02 New Tom Hickey 3 1,713 1,713 0.01 New Barbara Wardlaw 6 1,611 410 0.01 – Liz White 4 527 455 – – Conrad Schmidt 1 425 425 – New Western Block Doug Christie 1 195 899 – -0.01 Roger Poisson 2 186 186 – New Total 1,601 13,834,294 100.00% Rejected ballots 94,799 3,255 Turnout 13,929,093 979,610 58.83% 5.84 Registered voters 23,677,639 623,024 ==Notes== ==References== Category:2008 elections Category:2008 in Canada 2008 Category:October 2008 events",
