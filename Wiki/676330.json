 "text": "Sakuri's Object, also known as V4334 Sagittarii, is a star in the Sagittarius constellation. It is thought it was a white dwarf that swelled and became a red giant. It is at the center of a planetary nebula. Sakurai's Object and other similar stars are expected to end up as helium-rich white dwarfs. They go through a \"born-again\" giant phase back to the white dwarf cooling track. Sakuri's Object was discovered in 1996. ==References== Category:Stars",
