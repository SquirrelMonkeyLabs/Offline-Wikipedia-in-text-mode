 "text": "Kanye West announced his 2020 presidential campaign through Twitter on July 4, 2020, Independence Day. The idea of West's candidacy began when he first announced his plans to run in August 2015. He entered the election after missing at least four states' deadlines to appear on the ballot as a third- party candidate. West picked Michelle Tidball, a preacher from Wyoming, as his running mate. West's rhetoric has been described as right-wing, along with having \"a Republican-leaning, pro-Black religious platform\". On July 16, 2020, the campaign filed a Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. West has qualified for ballot access in Oklahoma and held a rally in South Carolina. On October 16, 2020, West released a song titled \"Nah Nah Nah\". This song was the theme song of his campaign, but it was not liked by critics. It became an inside joke for fans. ==References== West, Kanye",
