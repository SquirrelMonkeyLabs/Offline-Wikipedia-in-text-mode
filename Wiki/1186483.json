 "text": "Career networking means talking to people who can help you find a job or do better in your work. It means showing real interest and being kind when you talk to people who know helpful things, can help you get hired, or can give you a job. The key goal is to build good relationships that support your goals (this relates to social capital). You do this by slowly becoming part of their trusted group (this relates to circle of trust), making them like you in a likable way (this relates to affinity bias), and by staying in touch by saying hello or checking in once in a while. == References == Category:Society",
