 "text": "Child grooming is a term which describes when an adult becomes \"friends\" with a child to lower the inhibitions of the child sometimes to prepare for sexual abuse. So, any action taken by an adult to form a trusting relationship with a child, with the intent of later having sexual contact, is 'child grooming'.Crosson-Tower, Cynthia 2005. Understanding child abuse and neglect. Allyn & Bacon. . The act of grooming a child may include activities that are legal, but later lead to sexual contact. The grooming is done to gain the child's trust, and the trust of those responsible for the child. Children are less likely to report a crime if it involves someone the child knows, trusts, and cares about. Also, a relationship with the family means the child's parents will be less likely to believe any accusations. == Examples of grooming == * Taking interest in someone's child (having a \"special\" friend) * Giving gifts or money to the child for no obvious reason * Showing pornography to the child - this is illegal in many countries * Talking about sexual topics that are not age-appropriate * Invading the child's privacy (e.g. walking in on him/her in the bathroom) * Hugging, kissing, or other physical contact if the child does not want this attention * Allowing the child to get away with behavior that is not right. * Talking to the child about problems that would normally be discussed with adults (e.g. marriage problems).Levesque, Roger J.R. 1999.

In 2005, Yahoo! chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general's office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested that they were being used for this purpose. That October, Yahoo! agreed to \"implement policies and procedures designed to ensure\" that such rooms would not be allowed. An organization called Perverted-Justice (known as PJ) uses PJ operatives posing as underage teens on the internet to identify potential child molesters and turn the information over to the police and the courts.
