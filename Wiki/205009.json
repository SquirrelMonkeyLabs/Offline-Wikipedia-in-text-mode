 "text": "Kingsnakes are colubrid snakes. They are members of the genus Lampropeltis, which include milk snakes and four other species. There are many subspecies, and experts differ on their classification. These snakes are mostly found in North America and Central America. They use constriction to kill their prey. They prey on other snakes, including venomous snakes. They are immune to the venom. They also eat lizards, rodents, birds, and eggs.Conant R. 1975. A field guide to reptiles and amphibians of Eastern and Central North America. 2nd ed, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, genus Lampropeltis, p. 201. They have red, black, and white or cream bands, creating a striking appearance. Their colouration is an example of Batesian mimicry, because it is very similar to venomous coral snakes living in the same areas. This gives the kingsnakes protection from the birds which prey on them.Kikuchi, David W. & Pfennig, David W. 2010. Predator cognition permits imperfect coral snake mimicry. The American Naturalist. 176 (6): 830â€“834. Their length is usually about 3 to 4 feet. == References == Category:Colubrids",
