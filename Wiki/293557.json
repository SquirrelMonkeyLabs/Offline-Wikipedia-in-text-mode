 "text": "Knaresborough is a town in North Yorkshire, England. It is east of Harrogate. In 2001 there were 14,761 people living in Knaresborough. It was presumably unearthed near Farnham near where two key Roman routes ran: Cade's Road on the eastern side and Dere Street to the west, a major route to York and Hadrian's Wall. There were a number of rich Roman villas in the vicinity and the treasure may have come from one of these == References == Category:Towns in North Yorkshire",
