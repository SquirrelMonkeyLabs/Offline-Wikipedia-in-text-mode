 "text": "In road bicycle racing, and especially the three Grand Tour stage races Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana, the Green jersey is the name given to a cycling jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition. For example, while the overall race leader in the Tour de France will wear the yellow jersey, or \"maillot jaune\", the green jersey (\"maillot vert\") will be worn by the leader in the points competition for sprinters. In the Vuelta a Espana, the green jersey is worn by the \"King of the Mountains\", the leader in the competition for the best climber. The Giro d'Italia also used a green jersey for its \"King of the Mountains\" from 1974 to 2011, but that jersey was changed to a blue jersey, starting in 2012. == Classification Guide == === Overall Leader === The following events use the \"green jersey\" to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification by time (incomplete listing) * To Be Determined === Points Competition Leader === The following events use the \"green jersey\" to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification by points (often known as the sprinters competition): (incomplete listing) * Tour de France (known as the maillot vert) * Dauphiné Libéré * Tour de l'Avenir * Tour de Georgia === King of the Mountains === The following events use the \"green jersey\" to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification of the best climber : (incomplete listing) * Tour of Poland (Polish: known as the najlepszy góral or Klasyfikacja Górska) ====Former use==== * Giro d'Italia (Italian: known as the maglia verde) – Used from 1974 to 2011; a blue jersey (maglia azzurra) is now used instead.
