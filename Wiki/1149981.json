 "text": "Not much detail is found but accordingly a War was fought between Bijapur Sultanate and Golconda Sultanate for the possession of the Carnatic Region in which Bijapur Commadar Shahaji gave a crushing defeat to Golconda commander Mir Jumla hence Carnatic remained with Bijapur and Mir Jumla paid a Hun of 6-9 lakhs to Shahaji. ==The War== The Sultans of Bijapur and Golconda disagreed over how to divide the Carnatic region, which led to a war at the end of 1651. A letter from Fort St. George in January 1652 mentions the defeat of Mir Jumla. Although Shahaji is not mentioned in this report, Jairama describes the crushing defeat of Mir Jumla, who was considered the richest and most powerful general of his time. Despite his strength, Mir Jumla was forced to make peace by paying Shahaji 6 to 9 lakh pagodas. This victory highlighted Shahaji's military skill, earned him fame across India, and greatly increased his influence in the Bijapur court. This success gave a boost to Bijapur's campaigns. Shahaji and Ikhlas Khan attacked Shriranga of Vijaynagar Empire and defeated him at Jankal. They also captured the important fort of Penugonda, which had once been the capital of Vijayanagar. The loss of such a key fortress deeply worried the Hindu Rajas. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:History of India",
