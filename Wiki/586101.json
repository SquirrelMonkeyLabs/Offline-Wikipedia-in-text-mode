 "text": "The Red Line, sometimes known as the Howard-Dan Ryan Line or the North-South Line, is a rapid transit line in Chicago, run by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as part of the Chicago \"L\" system. It is the busiest line on the \"L\" system, with an average of 251,813 passengers boarding each weekday in 2012. The route is long with a total of 33 stations, from Howard station in Rogers Park on the north side, through the State Street subway and to 95th/Dan Ryan in Roseland on the south side. Like the Blue Line, the Red Line runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; it is one of only five mass-transit rail systems in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, Staten Island Railway, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway). ==References== Category:Transport in Chicago",
