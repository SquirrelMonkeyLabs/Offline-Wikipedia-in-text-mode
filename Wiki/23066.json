 "text": "The FA Cup (known as The Emirates FA Cup for sponsorship reasons) is a national football competition. It is played between teams in the English league system. It is organized by the Football Association. The winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the next season's UEFA Europa League. If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European competition, then the Europa League place goes to 6th or 7th place, depending on who won the Football League Cup. The FA Cup semi-finals and final is held at Wembley Stadium. The FA Cup is the oldest football competition in the world and first took place in 1871. The current holders are Manchester United F.C.
