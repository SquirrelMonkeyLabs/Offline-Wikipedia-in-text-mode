 "text": "Eugène Gigout (23 March 1844 – 9 December 1925) was a French organist and composer of European late-romantic music for organ. ==Early life== Gigout was born in Nancy, and died in Paris. A student of Camille Saint-Saëns, he served as the organist of Saint-Augustin Church in Paris for 62 years. He became known as a teacher. Also, his output as a composer was large and of high quality. Renowned as an expert improviser, he also founded his own music school. His nephew-by-marriage, Leon Boëllmann, became another fine organist and composer for the organ (but died at the very young age of 35). == Works == The 10 pièces pour orgue, composed in 1890, are Gigout's most famous compositions. They are the Toccata in B minor, his best-known composition, which turns up as a common encore at organ concerts. Also fairly often performed, and to be found in the same collection, is a Scherzo in E major. Other compositions by Gigout sometimes played nowadays are Grand Choeur Dialogué and Marche Religieuse. Gigout's works are now available on many commercial recordings. == References == ==Other websites== Category:1844 births Category:1925 deaths Category:20th-century French composers Category:People from Nancy",
