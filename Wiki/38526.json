 "text": "Ronin (浪人) is the word used to describe a kind of samurai without a master. Hundreds of years ago in Japan, it was very important for every samurai to have a master. It also refers to somebody who has failed their university entrance exams and is studying for the next year's exams. == Etymology == The word rōnin is often translated as 'drifter' or 'wanderer.' It combines two kanji: rō (浪), meaning \"wave\" or \"unrestrained,\" and nin (人), meaning \"person.\" Originally, it referred to serfs who had escaped their masters during the Nara and Heian periods. Later, it described samurai without a master. In medieval times, rōnin were seen as the shadowy figures of samurai, lacking honor and belonging. Category:Samurai",
