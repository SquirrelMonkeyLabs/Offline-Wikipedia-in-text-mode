 "text": "Healthcare in the United States is largely given by private sector healthcare comapnies, and paid for by a mix of public programs, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. The U.S. is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant part of its population does not have health insurance. The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country. Coverage is different across the population, with some groups, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, receiving more options for care through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. ==References== *",
