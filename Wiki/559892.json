 "text": "Dairy farming is a type of agriculture that is focused on producing milk. This is different from raising animals to produce meat. Milk can be used to produce dairy products, including cheese. Species commonly used are cows (also called dairy cows), goats, sheep and camels. Sometimes donkeys are used to produce an alternative to cows' milk for babies. Some babies can digest donkeys' milk better than cows' milk. Producing milk has been part of farming since prehistoric times. In the 20th century, farmers have become more specialized. Some farmers started with farms that only produce milk. ==References== Category:Agriculture",
