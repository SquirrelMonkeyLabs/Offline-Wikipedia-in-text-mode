 "text": "The central nervous system (CNS) is the largest part of the nervous system. It is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. Together with the peripheral nervous system, it has an important role in the control of behaviour. The CNS is protected by bone in the dorsal cavity: the brain in the cranial subcavity, and the spinal cord in the spinal canal. *See also: Vertebrate brain == Parts of the vertebrate CNS == Spinal cord Brain Brain stem Rhombencephalon Pons, Cerebellum, Medulla oblongata Mesencephalon Tectum, Cerebral peduncle, Pretectum, Mesencephalic duct Prosencephalon Diencephalon Epithalamus, Thalamus, Hypothalamus, Subthalamus, Pituitary gland, Pineal gland, Third ventricle Telencephalon Rhinencephalon, Amygdala, Hippocampus, Neocortex, Lateral ventricles == Other websites == * Sylvius: 400+ structure neuroanatomical visual glossary; used by over half of U.S. medical schools * High-Resolution Cytoarchitectural Primate Brain Atlases * Human Brains: A Learning Tool . * Explaining the human nervous system . * Nervous System - Back Pain - Anatomy (info on nerve pairs) . * Textbook in Medical Physiology And Pathophysiology, many links * Brain and Cranial Nerves, Anatomy and Physiology Lecture, Northland Community College * Latest Research on the Brain and Central Nervous System From ScienceDaily * Category:Nervous system",
