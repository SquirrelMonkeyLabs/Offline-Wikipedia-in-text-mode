 "text": "Are the various rebellions against Ottomans and Turkey in the Dersim region Various rebellions took place in the region in the 1877, 1885, 1892, 1907, 1911, 1914 and 1916. The last one was published in 1938. == Background == At the time of the establishment of the Safavid Empire, Shi'ism, the official sect of the Safavid Empire, had been able to spread to Dersim in a favourable manner. The Kurds of Dersim showed favour towards Shāh Ismā'īl I and agreed to cede the fortress of Kemah to Ismā'īl as a military base to facilitate the military movements of the Safavids, on condition that their sovereignty and independence would be respected by Ismā'īl. Although the Ottoman presence began to be felt in the region after Mehmed II the Conqueror defeated the Aq Qoyunlu in 1473, its incorporation into the Ottoman lands took place after the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 during the reign of Selim the Grim. However, the harsh and rugged geographical structure of this place caused it to be in the hands of local administrators from time to time, away from state control. They displayed a rebellious situation during the weak periods of the central administrations. Even in 1895 between 1897, many Armenian fedayis took refuge in Dersim and benefited from the baht (of asylum) of the Dersimites and were able to protect themselves against the bathtubs of the Turkish sultanate administration. == References == == Sources == * * * * * Category:19th-century rebellions Category:20th-century rebellions Category:Ottoman Empire Category:Rebellions in Asia Category:History of Turkey",
