 "text": "Gatka is a South Asian martial art most commonly practised in the Punjab region. Though today generally identified with Punjabi Sikhs, it has traditionally been practiced by other ethno-cultural groups in Pakistan such as the Tanolis and Hindkowans. The word gatka properly refers to the wooden sticks which were originally used for sparring in this sport although now a range of other weapons are also employed. Gatka can be practiced either as a contact sport (khel) or ritual/ceremonial demonstration (rasmi). == References == Category:Martial arts Category:Sport in India Category:Sport in Pakistan",
