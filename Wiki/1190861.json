 "text": "India has two main official short names: India and Bharat. Both names are important because of history. Some North Indians also call it Hindustan when they talk to each other. People use \"India,\" \"Bharat,\" or \"Hindustan\" based on the situation and language they are speaking. == India == The English term is from Greek Indikē (cf. Megasthenes' work Indica) or (), via Latin transliteration .: \"Apparently the same territory was referred to as Hi(n)du(sh) in the Naqsh‐i‐Rustam inscription of Darius I as one of the countries in his empire. The terms Hindu and India ('Indoi) indicate an original indigenous expression like Sindhu. The name Sindhu could have been pronounced by the Persians as Hindu (replacing s by h and dh by d) and the Greeks would have transformed the latter as Indo‐ (Indoi, Latin Indica, India) with h dropped...\" The Old Persian word for \"Síndhu\" was \"Hindu.\" When King Darius I conquered Sindh around 516 BCE, the Persians called the region \"Hinduš.\" Scylax of Caryanda, an explorer working for the Persian emperor, likely introduced this name to Greek. In Herodotus’s *Geography*, the words \"Indos\" (for the Indus River) and \"Indian\" appear. The Greek dialects spoken in Asia Minor may have caused the loss of the /h/ sound. Herodotus also used \"Indian\" to describe all people east of Persia, even though he didn’t have a precise understanding of the geography.: \"The term 'Indians' was used by Herodotus as a collective name for all the peoples living east of Persia. This was also a significant development over Hekataios, who had used this term in a strict sense for the groups dwelling in Sindh only.\" == Indies == The term \"Indies\" originally referred to land east of the Indus River and was another way of saying \"India.\" When the Portuguese explored new regions, they called them the Indies. The Caribbean islands were first called the \"Indies\" because explorers thought they had reached India. Later, when they realized these islands were in the western hemisphere, they renamed them the \"West Indies,\" meaning \"India in the west.\" Indonesia was once called the Dutch East Indies, meaning \"India in Southeast Asia.\" This is different from \"Dutch India,\" which referred to the trading posts of the Dutch East India Company in the Indian subcontinent. == Bhārat == Bharat is another name for India, officially recognized in Article 1 of the Indian Constitution, adopted in 1950. The Constitution states in English: \"India, that is Bharat,...\" The name Bharat was commonly used in Sanskrit and later became a self-chosen alternative name for India, embraced by many people in the Indian subcontinent.Article 1 of the English version of the Constitution of India: \"India that is Bharat shall be a Union of States.\" Bharat comes from the name of the Bharatas, a Vedic community mentioned in the Rigveda. They were one of the original groups in Āryāvarta and played a significant role in the Battle of the Ten Kings. The earliest known use of \"Bhārata-varṣa\" as a geographical term appears in the Hathigumpha inscription of King Kharavela from the first century BCE. In this inscription, the name refers to a limited region in northern India, specifically the part of the Ganges west of Magadha. It also states that Bharat was named after Bharata, the son of Rishabhanatha, the first Jain Tirthankara.Dwijendra Narayan Jha, Rethinking Hindu Identity (Routledge: 2014), p.11Upinder Singh, Political Violence in Ancient India, p.253 == Hind/Hindustān == : The name \"Hindush\" was recorded in the Old Persian cuneiform script, used in Achaemenid inscriptions. It was written as \"𐏃𐎡𐎯𐎢𐏁\" (H-i-du-u-š). This script was used in various regions, including Egypt, where references to Hindush were also found in inscriptions from the Achaemenid era.O4-N35-D46-V4-M17-M17() on the Statue of Darius I, circa 500 BCE.National Museum of Iran notice : Emperor Babur of the Mughal Empire described India’s geography, saying, \"On the East, the South, and the West it is bounded by the Great Ocean.\" The word \"Hind\" was adapted into Arabic as \"Al-Hind\" (الهند) to refer to India, as seen in historical works like the 11th-century *Tarikh Al- Hind* (\"History of India\"). The term still appears in India today, such as in the patriotic phrase \"Jai Hind\" (जय हिन्द) and in \"Hind Mahāsāgar\" (हिन्द महासागर), the Hindi name for the Indian Ocean. == Jambudvīpa == Jambudvīpa () was an ancient name for India before \"Bhārat\" became widely used. It may indirectly refer to Insular India. The term \"Jambu Dwipa\" was historically used in many Southeast Asian countries to refer to India before the English word \"India\" was introduced. Even today, it is sometimes used in Thailand, Malaysia, Java, and Bali to describe the Indian subcontinent, though it can also refer to all of Asia. Maurya Emperor Ashoka used this name in his inscriptions to describe his empire. == Gyagar and Phagyul == Gyagar and Phagyul are Tibetan names for India. Ancient Tibetan Buddhist writers and travelers used Gyagar to refer to India, especially in the south, while Madhyadesa meant the central land or holy center. From the 13th century onward, Tibetan lamas and scholars also used Phagyul, short for Phags yul, meaning \"land of Aryas\" or \"land of noble, enlightened people.\" Tibetan scholar Gendun Chopel explains that Gyagar comes from the Sanskrit word *vihāra*, meaning \"Buddhist monastery,\" and ancient Tibetans used the term Geysar mainly for northern and central India, from Kuru (modern Haryana) to Magadha (modern Bihar). The *Epic of King Gesar*, which evolved between 200 BCE and 600 CE, described India as \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Buddhist Doctrine,\" \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Aru Medicine\" (Ayurveda), \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Pearls,\" and \"Gyagar: The Kingdom of Golden Vases.\" The Central Tibetan Administration highlights Tibet's deep connections to India in geography, history, culture, and spirituality, calling it *Gyagar Phagpay Yul*, or \"India, the land of Aryas.\" The Dalai Lama reveres India as a guru and Tibet as its disciple, describing himself as a \"Son of India\" and a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. He continues to promote India's ancient wisdom, particularly the Nalanda tradition.Thank you India, Central Tibetan Administration, published: Jan 2018, accessed: 19 Dec 2022. == Tiānzhú == ( originally pronounced ) is one of several Chinese transliterations of the Sanskrit Sindhu via Persian Hindu and is used since ancient times in China and its peripheries. Its Sino-Xenic reading is in Japanese, () in Korean, and in Vietnamese. Buddhists in the Sinosphere traditionally used this term and its related forms to show India as their \"heavenly centre\", referring to the sacred origins of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent.An Invitation to Indian ArchitectureHow the Japan-India alliance could redraw the political map Other names for India appear in historical Chinese texts. Juāndú (身毒) is mentioned in Sima Qian's Shiji, while Tiāndǔ (天篤) is used in the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han). Another term, Yìntèjiā or Indəkka (印特伽), comes from the Kuchean Indaka, which is a different transliteration of \"Hindu.\" == Hodû == Hodu ( Hodû) is the Biblical Hebrew name for India mentioned in the Book of Esther part of the Jewish Tanakh and Christian Old Testament. In Esther, 1:1 and 8:9, and Ahasuerus had been described as King ruling 127 provinces from Hodu (India) to Ethiopia. The term seemingly derives from Sanskrit Sindhu, \"great river\", i.e., the Indus River, via Old Persian Hiñd°u.Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon at BibleHub It is thus cognate with the term India. = Historical Definitions of India = : Year Name Source Definition 944 Al-Hind Al-Masudi Muruj adh-dhahab wa ma'adin al-jawhar The Hindu nation (*Al-Hind*) stretches from the mountains of Khorasan and Baluchistan (*es-Sind*) to the Tibetan Plateau (*et-Tubbet*). 982–983 Hindistān Author Unknown Hudud al-'Alam Hindistān is bordered by China and Tibet to the east, the Great Sea to the south, the Mihran (Indus River) to the west, and the region of Shaknan in Vakhan along with some parts of Tibet to the north. 1205 Hind Hasan Nizāmī The entire land of Hind stretches from Peshawar in the north to the Indian Ocean in the south, and from Sehwan (on the west bank of the Indus) to the mountains in the east that separate it from China. 1298 India the Greater India the Minor Middle India Marco Polo India the Greater stretches from Maabar to Kesmacoran (Coromandel to Mekran) and includes 13 great kingdoms.

But this is enough about India the Greater and Lesser. As for India Tertia, I have not seen its wonders, as I have never been there. 1404 India Minor Ruy González de Clavijo On Thursday, the ambassadors reached a big river called the Oxus and crossed to the other side. That evening, they arrived in a large city named Tenmit (Termez). In the past, this city was part of India Minor, but it now belongs to the empire of Samarkand after being taken over by Tamurbec. 1590 Hindustān Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak Ain-i-Akbari Hindustan is said to be surrounded by the ocean on the east, west, and south, but its territory includes several islands, such as Sarandip (Sri Lanka), Achin (Indonesia), Maluk (Indonesia), and Malagha (Malaysia), along with many others. 16th century Indostān Ignazio Danti The region of India beyond the Ganges stretches all the way to Cathay (China) and includes many provinces with remarkable features.
