In 1886, she founded a place called Hull House along with Ellen Gates Starr. It tried to take care of the problems poor people and immigrants faced in Chicago through social work. She wanted more peace, and more civil rights for immigrants and women against prostitution. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931, and was the first American woman to earn it. She was the sister of Alice Haldeman. Addams was a lesbian. She died in Chicago. ==Related pages== *List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people ==References== ==Other websites== Category:1860 births Category:1935 deaths Category:American activists Category:American Nobel Prize winners Category:American sociologists Category:Lesbians Category:LGBT Nobel Prize winners Category:LGBT people from Chicago Category:LGBT scientists Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:Scientists from Chicago",
