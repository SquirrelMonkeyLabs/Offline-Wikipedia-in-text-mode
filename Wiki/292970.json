In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a term given to the group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs. This record stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974. Aaron's ending career total, 755, stayed the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Albert Pujols is the most recent to reach 500 home runs; he hit his 500th home run on April 22, 2014. Twenty- six players are members of the 500 home run club. Of these 26 players, 14 were right-handed batters, 10 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters (meaning they could bat from either side of the plate). The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to have four players reach 500 home runs while on their roster: Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and most recently Bonds. Four 500 home run club members—Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, and Rafael Palmeiro—are also members of the 3,000 hit club. Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home run was also his first with his franchise. Alex Rodriguez, at 32 years and 8 days, was the youngest player to hit 500. Ted Williams, at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest. Being a member of the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years. Four club members who are now eligible for election to the Hall of Fame—Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Palmeiro—have not been elected. Eligibility requires that a player has \"been retired five seasons\" or be dead for at least six months. Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009. Also, several of these recent members have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall, the voters were starting a \"guideline\" on how they would treat players from the \"Steroid Era\". Since then, Bonds and Sosa have also failed to earn election. Most recently, Palmeiro became the first club member to be dropped from the Hall of Fame ballot, failing to earn enough votes (5% of votes cast) in the 2014 election to stay on the ballot. ==Key== Player Name of the player HR Career home runs Date Date of the player's 500th home run Team The batter's team for his 500th home run Seasons The seasons this player played in the major leagues † Elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame * Denotes player who is still active ==Members== :Statistics up to date as of June 8, 2014 Player HR Date Team Seasons Ref(s) 762 San Francisco Giants 1986–2007 † 755 Atlanta Braves 1954–1976 † 714 New York Yankees 1914–1935 † 660 San Francisco Giants 1951–1973 630 Cincinnati Reds 1989–2010 * 618 New York Yankees 1994– 612 Chicago White Sox 1991–2012 609 Chicago Cubs 1989–2005, 2007 † 586 Baltimore Orioles 1956–1976 583 St. Louis Cardinals 1986–2001 † 573 Minnesota Twins 1954–1975 569 Texas Rangers 1986–2005 † 563 California Angels 1967–1987 555 Boston Red Sox 1993–2011 † 548 Philadelphia Phillies 1972–1989 † 536 New York Yankees 1951–1968 † 534 Boston Red Sox 1925–1942, 1944–1945 † 521 Boston Red Sox 1939–1942, 1946–1960 † 521 San Francisco Giants 1959–1980 † 521 Toronto Blue Jays 1990–2008 † 512 Chicago Cubs 1953–1971 † 512 Houston Astros 1952–1968 † 511 New York Giants 1926–1947 509 New York Mets 1988–2009 * 507 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2001– † 504 Baltimore Orioles 1977–1997 ==Footnotes== *Although MLB.com's 500 Home Run Club page lists Mathews at 511 home runs, his listings on both MLB.com and Baseball-Reference show 512. ==References== ;General * * ;Specific Category:Baseball statistics",
