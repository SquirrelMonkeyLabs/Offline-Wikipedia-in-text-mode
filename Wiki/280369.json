 "text": "Capri pants are a type of pants. They are shorter than normal pants; they end between the knee and lower leg. They were first made in 1948 by Sonja de Lennart, a clothes designer from Prussia. They were popular in the 1950s and 1960s, but went out of style until the 2000s, when they became popular again. Some pants have a zipper at the knee, allowing them to be converted into shorts. This design allows people to change between shorts and pants in variable weather conditions. ==References== Category:Trousers and shorts",
