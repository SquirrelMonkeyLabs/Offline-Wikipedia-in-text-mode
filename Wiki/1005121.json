 "text": "Kaijin Shrine (海神神社) is a significant Shinto shrine in Tsushima Island, Nagasaki that holds a Beppyo status. This status denotes that the shrine is remarkable and holds a significant historical importance. Kaijin Shrine is also ranked as an Ichinomiya, which means it is the highest-ranked shrine in its province. Kaijin Shrine should not be confused with Watatsumi Shrine, which has a very similar Japanese name (海神社) to Kaijin Shrine (海神神社). In 2012 a robber stole a Buddha statue from the shrine, but in 2015 it was returned. == Related pages == * Watatsumi jinja == References == Category:Kokuhei Chūsha Category:Myōjin Taisha Category:Ichinomiya Category:Beppyo shrines Category:Shinto shrines in Nagasaki Prefecture",
