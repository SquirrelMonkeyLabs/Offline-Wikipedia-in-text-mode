 "text": "\"Riot\" is a song by American rapper XXXTentacion. The song was first released on X's SoundCloud on May 1, 2015. The song was later re-released on June 1, 2020. The song was able to make it to #1 on RMNZ's Hot Singles Chart. X released the song on his SoundCloud during the height of the protests following the Shooting of Michael Brown. It was later re-released by Empire during the George Floyd protests. In the song, X says that he does not agree with riots and asks the rioters to think about the people who own the stores they are vandalizing. However, he also says that he understands the anger from police brutality and injustice. The song ends with a speech by Jeff Berry, leader of the Ku Klux Klan. X used the speech to try and make people aware of the rising racism, homophobia, and antisemitism. The speech is mostly taken off the song in the re-release. On September 12, 2017, a music video for the song was released. It was directed by JMP. The first half of the music video featured \"Look at Me\" for the first half and \"Riot\" for the second half of the video. The video caused controversy. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2015 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
