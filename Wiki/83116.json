 "text": "Jon Brion (born December 11, 1963) is an American rock and pop multi- instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, composer and record producer. He was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. His mother was a jazz singer, his father a band director at Yale, his brother is an arranger and sister a violinist. ==The Bats== Brion and Bill Murphy began writing together in New Haven, Connecticut. They recorded some demo tracks in makeshift apartment studios, and worked out their arrangements at Yale University Campus. They enlisted the talents of bassist Don \"Riff\" Fertman to form The Bats (unlike the New Zealand band of the same name). In 1982, the trio created a imaginative set of pop songs in a small studio in Connecticut. A single called \"Popgun\" followed by an LP entitled How Pop Can You Get? were released on the independent label Gustav. The album failed to chart, and the group was disbanded. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *How Pop Can You Get?
