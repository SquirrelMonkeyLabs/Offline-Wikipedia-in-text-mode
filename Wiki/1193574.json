 "text": "The Club Paradise Tour was Canadian rapper Drake's second concert tour as a headlining act. It was for his 2011 studio album Take Care. The tour began on February 14, 2012 in Coral Gables, Florida. It ended on June 17, 2012 in Mansfield, Massachusetts. == Background == In October 2011, Drake announced the Club Paradise Tour. From February to April 2012, American rapper Kendrick Lamar opened for Drake on the tour. Also in February, rapper A$AP Rocky joined Lamar as the opening act for the tour. The tour was very successful. It was the highest-grossing hip-hop tour of 2012, earning around $42 million. After seeing the popularity of the tour and ticket sales, Drake decided to add a second leg for the tour across North America. == Set list == These are the songs that Drake performed during the tour.
