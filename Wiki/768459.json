 "text": "Freycinet's frog or Wallum rocketfrog or rocket frog (Litoria freycineti) is a frog from eastern Australia. It lives on the east coast of Australia and on Fraser Island. This frog can grow to 4.5 cm from nose to rear end. Its skin is brown with irregular patterns on it. The tadpoles can live even in hot water. This frog can live in many different kinds of places, but it likes temporary swamps not far from the ocean. These swamps are called wallum in Australia. It looks for food during the day. This frog is in danger because human beings build things in the places it likes to live. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
