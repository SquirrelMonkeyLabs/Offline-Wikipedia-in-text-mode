 "text": "Frans Van den Eynde (5 April 1923 â€“ 2 November 2021) was a Belgian politician. Van den Eynde was member of the CVP. Van den Eynde was councilor. In 1980 he became mayor of Aartselaar. He succeeded his party colleague Frans De Groof after internal disagreements within the party. He was re-elected in subsequent elections and was mayor for eight years until 1988. During his period as mayor, he had to deal with the allotment rage that was a main issue in the municipality before his appointment. Also during his period the municipal council bought the Solhof castle domain with the intention of housing municipal services. That ultimately did not happen and the buildings were later sold back. But the domain was transformed into a municipal park. Van den Eynde was succeeded by Camille Paulus. Van den Eynde died in retirement home \"Zonnetij\" in Aartselaar on 2 November 2021. == References == Category:1923 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Belgian politicians",
