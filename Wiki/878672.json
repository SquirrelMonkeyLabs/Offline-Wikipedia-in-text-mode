They were founded in 2010 by Linda Riley with a ceremony at the Savoy Hotel in London, hosted by BBC journalist Jane Hill. The event remained at the Savoy for the next two years. In 2014 the event moved to the Natural History Museum in London where it remained until 2019. The event is hosted by actor and Booker nominated author Sophie Ward. The attendees include representatives from business, politics, community and charitable organisations and the media. The awards recognise the individuals and organisations whose dedication and commitment has made a genuine difference to the equality, diversity and inclusion agenda.
