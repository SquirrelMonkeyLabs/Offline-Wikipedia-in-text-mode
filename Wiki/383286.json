 "text": "Wheatfield with Crows is an oil painting by Vincent van Gogh. It was finished about 10 July 1890. In 1890, Van Gogh wrote that he had made three paintings in Auvers-sur-Oise of large fields of wheat under troubled skies. Wheat Field with Crows was one of them. This painting in particular is often thought to reflect his state of mind towards the end of his life.Pickvance, Ronald 1986. Van Gogh In Saint-RÃ©my and Auvers (exh. cat.
