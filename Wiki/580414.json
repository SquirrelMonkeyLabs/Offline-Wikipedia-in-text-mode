She was the first black woman and Muslim to be appointed to a seat on New York's highest court, and the first Muslim woman to serve on the bench in the United States. Abdus-Salaam was found dead on April 12, 2017 at the age of 65. Her body was found floating in the Manhattan side of the Hudson River hours after she was reported missing from her home in Harlem.
