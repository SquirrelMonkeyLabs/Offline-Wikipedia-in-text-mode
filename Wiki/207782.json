 "text": "Kowloon Walled City was a tiny Chinese enclave in Hong Kong. It was a military fort for hundreds of years, but later became a very dense settlement. In 1980, the city had about 35,000 people on about 20,000 mÂ² of land, making it one of the most densely populated places on earth. It was torn down in 1993, and a park called Kowloon Walled City Park was built in 1994. The area where Kowloon Walled City was located is now called Kowloon City. It is part of the Kowloon City District of Kowloon, Hong Kong. At the end of the whole destruction process of the Kowloon Walled City, 51% of people had to go to temporary housing just outside the walled city. When they destroyed the walled city it was hard to destroy all the walled city's machinery. The walled city was known for its brothels, dentists, and opium houses. ==References== ==Other websites== * Tofu Magazine article on Kowloon Walled City * Video exploring Kowloon Walled City * Photos of Kowloon Walled City Park Category:Geography of Hong Kong Category:Shanty towns",
