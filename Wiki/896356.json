Her reason for being in the US, on an expired visa, is her five year old son, Luca. Luca has a rare and life-threatening medical disorder, for which he needs a cutting edge, bone marrow treatment, which is only available in Las Vegas. Until she gets treatment for her son, Thony makes a living, not as a trained doctor but as a cleaning service worker, alongside her, sister in law, Fiona. After Thony accidentally witnesses a serious crime and is discovered hiding by the perpetrator behind it, Arman Morales, she's offered a job both as a cleaner and a doctor within their criminal organization that could pay well enough to help her son and her family.
