Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy. Midland is also famous as the hometown of former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush. She and her husband, former president George H. W. Bush lived there, with their children including the later US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, and his brother Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Florida. == References == Category:Cities in Texas Category:County seats in Texas",
