He was specialized in the field of fifteenth-century Franco-Flemish composers. ==Biography== Van Benthem was born in Rotterdam in 1937. He was the eldest child in a family of teachers. As a result of the German bombing of Rotterdam in 1940, the family became homeless, after which they found shelter in Delft. In Delft he attended primary school. He attended secondary school in Rotterdam. Like his family members, he studied for becoming a teacher. However, from the age of 12 years old he also studied piano at the Conservatory of Rotterdam by Jaap Callenbach. He also studied music theory in Utrecht.

Van Benthem became known for his studies on various Dutch composers from the fifteenth century. He had special interest in Josquin des Prez (1450-1521).
