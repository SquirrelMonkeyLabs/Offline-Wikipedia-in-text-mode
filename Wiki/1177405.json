 "text": "Since ancient times, antisemites claiming to be critics of Judaism have spread antisemitism IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism : * Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. * Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. * Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. * Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). * Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. * Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations. * Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. * Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation. * Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis. * Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis. * Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. by promoting false claims about Judaism based on distortions of passages from the Talmud and Midrash. * * * * * ==Overview== Some antisemites judge the distorted passages by their own standards, and ignore the fact that the passages were written two thousand years ago by those in different cultures. Some antisemites also do so when they dislike something related to Judaism. In particular, racist scholars have a history of spreading antisemitism * * * * * * by demonizing Judaism under the pretence of academic study to defend themselves against accusations of antisemitism, similar to Holocaust deniers * * * * * Distortion of the Holocaust refers, inter alia, to: and some other scholars. A common talk point of self-declared critics of Judaism is that \"Jews hate or conspire against Christianity\". ==Christianity== Christianity originated as a persecuted sect of Judaism in Roman Judea. Early Christians were mostly Jewish before non-Jewish converts became the majority and split with Judaism over theological differences. * * * Christianity became the Roman state religion in 380 AD. ===Theological disputes between Judaism and Christianity=== While antisemitism already existed in Ancient Egypt, far longer than Christianity, Jews have been blamed for the death of Jesus since the 1st century. The blame reportedly started with descriptions about the Crucifixion in the New Testament. * * * * * * * Jeremy Cohen, Christ Killers: The Jews and the Passion from the Bible to the Big Screen, Oxford University Press 2007. p. 55. Another conflict between Jews and Christians was whether the TorahThe first five books of the Old Testament, also known as the Five Books of Moses. was still valid. The conflict extended to circumcision, when Paul used \"Judaizers\" to call Jews who demanded non- Jewish converts to circumcise. Paul believed that faith in Christ alone was enough for someone to be saved by God. Paul asked Christians not to follow the Old Covenant while accusing Jews of \"turning from the [Holy] Spirit to the flesh\" to look good to God. Particularly, John Chrysostom's homily series Adversus Judaeos * * * is seen by many historians as having inspired antisemites to justify pogroms, expulsions and discrimination against Jews in the following 1,600 years.Walter Laqueur, The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day (Oxford University Press: 2006) , pp. 47–48 Such antisemites include Nazi Germany's ruler Adolf Hitler, who reprinted and circulated Chrysostom's text among Germans within Nazi territories to justify the Holocaust. ===Ignatius of Antioch=== In the early decades of Christianity, Church Father Ignatius of Antioch (c. 50–117) claimed that those who followed Jewish custom were \"partakers with those who killed Jesus\". ===Justin Martyr=== Church Father Justin Martyr (100–165) claimed that God's covenant (also known as the Old Covenant or Mosaic Covenant) with the Jews was no longer valid and that Christians had replaced them because the Jews \"[had] slain the Just One [Jesus]\", who would deserve exile and persecution in the centuries to come. ===John Chrysostom=== Church Father John Chrysostom (c. 347–407), who served as the archbishop of Constantinople, wrote in his homily series Adversus Judaeos (Ancient Greek: Κατὰ Ἰουδαίων Kata Ioudaiōn, \"against the Jews\"): As there were only two other ordained individuals in Antioch legally recognized as Christian preachers, Chrysostom managed to promote his ideas to most local Christians.Christine C.

The claims in Luther's book are still being promoted by some influencers. In his book, he classified Jews as the biggest threat to Christianity and called for these actions against them:\"Luther, Martin\", JewishEncyclopedia.com; cf. Luther's Works, American Edition, 55 vols., (St. Louis and Philadelphia: Concordia Publishing House and Fortress Press, 1955–86) 47:267. > First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools [...] This is to be done > in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are > Christians [...] Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and > destroyed. [...] Sixth, I advise that [...] all cash and treasure of silver > and gold be taken from them [...] But if we are afraid that they might harm > us [...] then let us emulate the common sense of other nations such as > France, Spain, Bohemia [...] eject them forever from the country. In his sermon Warning against the Jews on February 18, 1546, Martin Luther said,Martin Brecht, Martin Luther, 3 vols. (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 3:371. Meanwhile, Martin Luther was a folk hero in Nazi Germany,Richard Steigmann-Gall, The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.138. whose teachings were widely circulated among the public. Luther's statues were also built across Nazi Germany, along with regular celebrations of \"German Luther Day\", a national holiday designated by Hitler in 1933. Johannes Wallman (1930–2021), a professor of church history at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, wrote in 1987: Richard Steigmann-Gall, a history professor at Kent State University, wrote in his 2003 book The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945: ===Radical traditionalist Catholics=== A minority of conservative Catholics, commonly called the radical traditionalist Catholics, * * * * despite theologically opposed to Martin Luther, share similar views to him regarding Jews. According to American civil rights group Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), radical traditionalist Catholics tend to hold these views: * Catholics cannot trust Jews * Jews are the \"perpetual enemy\" of Christ * Jews have \"infiltrated\" the Catholic Church to make changes for themselves * Jews are responsible for Jesus' death, and this broke their covenant with God Radical traditionalist Catholics do not get along with the Vatican as they oppose the Vatican II reforms rolled out in 1965, which included Pope Paul VI's rejection of the 1,600-year official position that \"Jews are responsible for Jesus' death\": * * * ==France== Jews have been living in France since the Roman times as one of the oldest diasporas in Europe. * * * * * Antisemitism has existed in France for as long as Jews have been there, worsening in the 1,600 years following the Christianization of France. ===Middle Ages=== Under the Germanic Frankish Merovingian dynasty between the 5th and 8th century, Jews were banned from working as public servants. A succession of ecumenical councils also banned Jews from socializing with Christians or observing the shabbat over the unfounded fear that Judaism (the Jewish ethnoreligion) would influence Christians. ====11th century==== Under the Capetian dynasty, King Robert the Pious tried to kill all Jews who rejected Christianity. Jews across the France were assaulted, tortured or burned at stakes. The persecutions coincided with the destruction of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009, which was exploited by French Benedictine monk Rodulfus Glaber to spread rumors about Jewish \"involvement\" in the destruction. ====First Crusade==== When the First Crusade happened in 1096, Jews were massacred by the crusaders across the Kingdom of France. The events were seen by some historians as a series of genocidal massacres. * * * * * The massacres all happened with Roman Catholic Church's tacit approval. Between the 1182 and 1394, at least 13 expulsions of Jews were ordered by the French monarchy, during which dozens of Black Death- associated massacres of Jews happened. ===Renaissance=== Between the 15th century and 18th century, antisemitism in France fluctuated. Voltaire (1694–1778), a famous French philosopher, held bias against Jews that contributed to the normalization of antisemitism in Western academia. * * * * * * One of the instances of Voltaire's antisemitism was his insertion of an insult into his Dictionnaire philosophique for Jewish readers: Despite this, he was regarded as the champion of Enlightenment by Western leftists. ===Modern period=== ====19th century==== Antisemitism was widespread in 19th century France. It was present across the political spectrum, with ancient stereotypes being phrased differently and perpetuated by their respective audience. Jews were targeted for their otherness, observance of Judaism and alleged lack of loyalty or assimilation. Among the French far left, Jews were accused of being regressive agents of capitalism exploiting the French proletariat. Among the French far right, Jews were accused of being subversive agents of communism undermining the traditional Catholic culture. Meanwhile, both the far left and far right saw Jews as undesirable under French nationalism, which prioritized national unity over minority existence. * * * ====20th century==== On June 22, 1940, France surrendered to Nazi Germany upon military defeat and was divided into the German-occupied zone, Italian- occupied zone and Vichy France – a rump state in southern France managed by pro-Nazi French collaborators. * * * * * Under Vichy France's leaders Philippe Pétain and Pierre Laval, the Statut des Juifs (\"Jewish Statute\") – modelled after the Nazi German Nuremberg Laws – was passed between October 1940 and June 1941 to ban Jews from all jobs. Just as in Nazi Germany, such persecution escalated to the deportation of Jews to extermination camps. One of the worst deportations was the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup on 16–17 July 1942 voluntarily conducted by the Vichy French police. In total, 77,000 (33%) Jews living in France were killed in extermination camps. Antisemitism in post-war France mainly took the form of Holocaust denial and radical anti-Zionism. Pierre Guillaume, an ultra-left anarcho-Marxist activist, published books denying the Holocaust as a \"distraction from class struggle\" that \"played into the hands of Zionism and Stalinism\". * * * Despite being left-wing, Guillaume's views were adopted by the French far right. They have trivialized the Holocaust by comparing the Holocaust to the Judean massacres of the Canaanites or the Native American genocide, and accused Jews of exploiting the Holocaust to extort compensations from European countries. A number of influential French Holocaust deniers appeared, such as Claude Autant-Lara, Maurice Bardèche, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Paul Rassinier, François Duprat, Serge Thion, Robert Faurisson, * * * and Dieudonné M'bala M'bala. ==Spain== ===Middle Ages=== Under the rule of Henry III of Castile and León (1390–1406), Jews were forced to either convert to Christianity or face death. It came at a time when the Spanish had just taken back a lot of land from the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula. ===Modern period=== From 1478 to 1834, the Spanish Empire systematically persecuted Jews, historically known as the Spanish Inquisition, * * * * * * * * * * due to its belief that Jews who converted to Catholicism (conversos) were mostly faking as Christians, including those forcibly converted following the Alhambra Decree, or the Edict of Expulsion. As many as 300,000 Jews were killed over the false charge of \"crypto-Judaism\", a charge slapped on Jews who were forcibly converted. Some historians saw the Spanish Inquisition as racially motivated, which was a turning point in the transition of religious anti-Judaism to racial antisemitism that lasts until today. ==Nazi Germany== In Nazi Germany (1933‒45), \"criticism\" of Judaism was a major theme in state propaganda. Top Nazi racial theorist Alfred Rosenberg justified intellectual attacks on Judaism: Rosenberg and other Nazis saw the Jewish emphasis on following the commandments for small details in life as a sign of \"lack of moral understanding\", while accusing Jews of \"double moral standards\" in dealing with gentiles. Some Nazis were experts on Judaism themselves, who were able to attack Judaism in a way more convincing to the public. ==Islam== Jews started living in the Arabian Peninsula in the 6th century BC, when Babylonian Empire's conquest of the Kingdom of Judah forced Jews out of Judea. Multiple immigration waves of Jewish exiles made them the leading ethnoreligious group in the Arabian Peninsula, where Judaism was different from the multi-god religion of ancient Arabs, many of whom arrived later than the Jews due to their nomadic nature. Jews thrived in the Arabian Peninsula until Muslims conquered the area, when they, along with other indigenous peoples, were required to pay jizya for their existence to be allowed. * * * The payment of jizya granted Jews the status of dhimmi under which they were prohibited – under the threat of execution – from criticizing any aspects of Islam, sharing Jewish ideas to Muslims or touching a Muslim woman. * * * * * Jews were also not allowed to: * drink wine in public * ride horses or camels * pray or mourn in loud voices * build synagogues taller than mosques * construct houses taller than Muslim houses ===Nation of Islam=== Nation of Islam (NOI) is a Black nationalist religious movement founded in 1930, * * * which played a notable role in the Civil Rights Movement (1954‒68) in the United States (US). Since its founding, it has been a subject of controversy due to its promotion of ideas commonly seen as antisemitic. * * * * * * * * * * In 1984, its leader Louis Farrakhan called Judaism a \"gutter religion [...] structured on injustice, thievery, lying and deceit\" that \"abused God's name for self-defense\" after meeting Mummar Gaddafi in Libya. In 1985, at an NOI meeting, Farrakhan said that the Jews deserved the Holocaust by screaming that \"And don't you forget, when it's God who puts you in the ovens, it's forever!\" Over the past decades, Farrakhan made several speeches demonizing Jews and Judaism. In 2020, Louis Farrakhan was classified by the American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as \"the most popular antisemite in America\". ==New religious movements== ===Black Hebrew Israelites=== A similar, and equally influential, movement is the Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI). * * * * * The BHI is founded on the pseudoscientific belief that African Americans are the \"real descendants\" of ancient Israelites. Some factions of the movement also see Native and Latino Americans as the descendants of ancient Israelites. From the 1970s onward, followers of the BHI have a history of committing terrorist attacks on American Jews, including but not limited to the 2019 Jersey City shooting (7 dead and 3 injured) and the Monsey Hanukkah stabbing (1 dead and 4 injured). * * * * * While differing in theology, the BHI and NOI are both antisemitic. Particularly, they both believe that \"Jews ran the Atlantic slave trade\" and \"European Jews descended from the Khazars\". ====BHI and NOI: common beliefs about Jews==== In an article, historian Eunice G. Pollack outlined the beliefs about Jews held by both the BHI and NOI: * Judaism is a \"dirty religion\" * All Jews are \"imposter Jews\" * Jews \"ran the Atlantic slave trade\" * European Jews \"descended from the Khazars\" * Black Americans are the \"real Jews\", who \"cannot be antisemitic\" towards \"themselves\" no matter what they think about Jews ====BHI and NOI: differences in beliefs about Jews==== Name Beliefs Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) * Jesus was \"Black rather than Jewish\" * Black people are the \"real chosen people\" * Judaism was \"invented by KenitesDescendants of Cain. 2,000 years ago\" * Jews \"infiltrated the Levite tribe\" to \"rewrite the Torah\" and \"create pagan converts\" * Jews \"stole the identity of the BHI to serve Satan\" Nation of Islam (NOI) * Jews are the \"servants of Satan\" * Islam is the \"real Judaism\" * Jews \"originated from Europe 4,000 years ago\" * Jews \"changed the Torah\" to \"justify the enslavement of Black people\" ==Academic views== ===Dara Horn=== Dara Horn, an American novelist, essayist and professor of literature, wrote in The Atlantic that: In the same article, Horn doubted Holocaust education's effectiveness based on persistent antisemitism in society, while pointing out that antisemitism functions by appropriating what has happened to Jews and reframing their experience as part of a \"universal\" fight that redefines Jewish identity as going against certain ideals. She said that attacks on Jews under the guise of anti-Zionism follow the same ancient pattern of marginalization and vilification. Some critics expressed similar concerns about the matter. * * * ===David Nirenberg=== American historian David Nirenberg (b. 1964) held a special view about the issue. Nirenberg saw anti-Judaism as a basic element of Western culture, which had existed for far longer than Christianity. In their works, ancient Western intellectuals ‒ especially Greek philosophers ‒ presented Judaism as a symbol of anything they disliked and made it a part of their people's subconcious. Hecataeus of Abdera, a Greek historian, wrote in 320 BC that Jews did not escape from Egypt but were expelled as undesirables. Hecataeus also accused Jews of living an an \"unsocial and intolerant mode of life\". Hecataeus' bias was shared by a later Egyptian priest called Manetho, who called Jews \"lepers and other unclean people\". Over the following centuries, the idea that Judaism equals something bad became a stereotype passed on from generation to generation. It was constantly weaponized by Christians in theological disputes, including Martin Luther who labelled Catholic Church's \"legalistic understanding of God's justice\" as \"Jewish\". The Puritans did the same in the English Civil War when they fought the Anglicans. In modern context, Nirenberg also implied that anti-Zionism was a product of anti-Judaism, when the State of Israel is seen by antisemites as the source of real-world problems. ===Gavin Langmuir=== Canadian historian Gavin Langmuir (1924‒2005) said that anti-Judaism was about exaggerated accusations against Jews, while antisemitism was rooted in falsehood.Abulafia (1998, part II, 77), referring to Langmuir (1971). Langmuir saw the accusation of \"Jews killing Jesus\" as an example of anti-Judaism, while accusations of well poisoning is an example of antisemitism. Langmuir believed that anti-Judaism and antisemitism had existed together since the 12th century and reinforced each other over the centuries. ===Joanna Tokarska- Bakir=== Polish anthropologist Joanna Tokarska-Bakir commented on the issue: ===Jules Isaac=== French historian Jules Isaac (1877–1963), author of the 1948 book Jésus et Israël, * 2002 Consultation of the National Council of Synagogues and the Bishops Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs. Retrieved August 22, 2016. * “A short introduction to Jules Isaac” * Carolyn Wesnousky, \"Under the Very Windows of the Pope”: Confronting Anti- Semitism in Catholic Theology after the Holocaust\" (2012), 59-60. proposed the Eighteen Points for Christian-Jewish reconciliation,Carolyn Wesnousky, \"Under the Very Windows of the Pope”: Confronting Anti-Semitism in Catholic Theology after the Holocaust\" (2012), 63. and Judith Rice, “Jules Isaac & Pope Benedict XVI.” which was considered by the Seelisberg Conference of Christians and Jews in 1947:Review of Jesus and Israel. Retrieved August 29, 2016. In his 1956 book Génése de l’Anti-Sémitisme (\"Has Anti-Semitism Roots in Christianity?\"), Isaac agreed that pagan antisemitism existed before Christ but made it clear: ===Steven Katz=== American philosopher Steven Katz (b. 1944), the founding director of the Elie Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies at Boston University in Massachusetts, wrote: ===Walter Laqueur=== Walter Laqueur (1921–2018), a German-American Jewish historian, said that the conditions for the 4th-century Christian church were \"brutal and aggressive\" as it was \"fighting for survival and recognition\", leading to the lack of demand for mercy and forgiveness, particularly due to the anti-Christian Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate (reigned 361–363). The three centuries of persecution of Christians did not end until the late 4th century, when the Christian church became the state religion of the Roman Empire under Theodosius I (reigned 379–395), who closed pagan temples in the process. ===William Nichols=== William Nichols, a religious professor at University of British Columbia (UBC) and former Anglican Church minister, said: ==Public views== ===Anti-Defamation League=== Regarding the matter, American civil rights group Anti-Defamation League (ADL) noted: ===Rabbi Rowe=== Rabbi Rowe, the former executive of Aish UK, said that the Talmud was \"the most natural target of antisemitism\", which has been \"going on for centuries\". The Talmud has been targeted because the Torah is the Old Testament of Christianity, and the secret nature of the Talmud makes it harder for laymen to have enough knowledge to refute false claims made by antisemites about it. Rabbi Rowe noted that antisemitism was always about demonization ‒ making Jews look hateful and demonic ‒ to justify emotional hatred of Jews. In addition, Rabbi Rowe cautioned that what used to be only Neo-Nazi propaganda was going mainstream due to social media influencers like Armenian-American businessman Dan Bilzerian, who has millions of followers ‒ across the political spectrum ‒ on Twitter and been exploiting the recent war in Gaza to link Israel with their twisted view of Judaism in order to sway the ignorant away from sympathizing with the Jews. ===Yossi Klein Halevi=== Author Yossi Klein Halevi believed that the comparison demonized Jews: ==False claims about Judaism== Some false claims made by antisemites about Judaism are summarized as follows. Aspect Summary Gentile humanhood Myth 1: \"Non-Jews are subhumans.\" Fact: Mainstream Judaism has never seen non-Jews as subhumans.Mishnah (Avoth 3:14) and Talmud (Avoth 9b): [רבי עקיבא] היה אומר: חביב אדם שנברא בצלם. חיבה יתרה נודעת לו שנברא בצלם, שנאמר (בראשית ט:ו), \"כי בצלם אלקים עשה את האדם.\" [Rabbi Akiva] used to say, “Beloved is man, for he was created in God’s image; and the fact that God made it known that man was created in His image is indicative of an even greater love. As the verse states (Genesis 9:6), ‘In the image of God, man was created.’)” It believes that everyone is equal as everyone is created by God in His image. Treatment of gentiles Myth 2: \"Jewish law allows Jews to kill non-Jews.\" Fact: Antisemites cite a line allegedly from Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai (2nd century). However, the line refers only to the situation of war. Simeon lived at a time when Jews were forced to fight non-Jews, especially in the Bar Kochba revolt, due to persecution by Roman Emperor Hadrian. Child sex abuse Myth 3: \"Judaism allows sex abuse of young girls.\" Fact: This claim was made by Russian Catholic Reverend I.B. Pranaitis. He was found to have distorted Talmud writings to demonize Jews. The Talmud actually treats child sex abuse as rape.\"פיתוי קטנה אונס נינהו.\" One who seduces an underage girl is considered as if he had raped her [i.e., the laws applicable to rapists would apply to the molester]. The distorted writings came from a chapter in the Ketubot discussing victims of child sex abuse, which actually stated that a girl sexually abused before three should be seen as a virgin and deserving of higher status. Study of Torah Myth 4: \"Non-Jews studying the Torah are worthy of death.\"J. David Bleich, Contemporary Halakhic Problems vol. 2 (New York: Ktav, 1983), pp. 311-340. Fact: This claim was made by David Duke, the former KKK leader and a Holocaust denier. He was found to have cherrypicked a line from a whole passage. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yohanan said that the misquoted passage did not refer to Jews but the generic \"Man\", who is supposed to be studying the Torah as a believer rather than making it a subject of study without spiritual commitment, which would be a form of blasphemy. Non-Jews studying the Torah are respected if they are studying it as a matter of faith. Honesty Myth 5: \"According to Libbre David 37, a Jew must give non-Jews a false explanation about the Talmud, or the Jew will be put to death.\" Fact: Libbre David 37 does not exist. It was made up by Neo-Nazis who run several disinformation websites. Gentile acts towards Jews Myth 6: \"If a Goy hits a Jew, he must be killed.\" Fact: This claim is based on the distortion of Sanhedrib 58b, which actually discusses options for dealing with non-Jewish attacks on Jews. It does not incite Jews to kill non-Jews. Socialization Myth 7: \"Tosfot Yevamot 84b says that a Jew eating with a Goy is the same as eating with a dog.\" Fact: It is a falsification. Lost items Myth 8: \"Bava Matzia 24a says that a Jew does not need to return an item lost by a Goy.\" Fact: This claim is based on the distortion of Bava Matzia 24a, which actually discusses options for dealing with items found lost after a flood or a wild animal encounter. ==Related pages== * Dual-covenant theology * Secondary antisemitism * The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ==Notelist== ==References== Category:Racism Category:Catholicism Category:Antisemitism Category:Jewish history Category:Disinformation Category:History of Europe",
