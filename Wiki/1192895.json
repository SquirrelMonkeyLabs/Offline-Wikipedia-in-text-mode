 "text": "Amanikhabale (also transliterated Astabarqaman) was a King of Kush who probably ruled in the first half of the 1st century CE. Amanikhabale is known from inscriptions from Kawa, Basa, and Naqa, as well as a broken stela from MeroÃ«. The quality and scale of the monuments on which Amanikhabale's inscriptions have been found, as well as their geographical distribution, indicates that he had a prosperous reign. George Andrew Reisner suggested that Amanikhabale was buried in Pyramid 2 at the North cemetery (Beg. N 2) at Meroe (Bagrawiyah),Reisner, G. A., The Meroitic Kingdom of Ethiopia: A Chronological Outline, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 9, No. 1/2 (Apr., 1923), pp. 34-77. largely supported by scholars since. Amanikhabale's name is known from a fragment of a table found in Beg. N 3, which can be fitted together with fragments in Beg. N 2 and Beg. N 4. The table designates his mother as the queen regnant Nawidemak. This further supports Beg. N 2 as his burial since it has close palaeographic similarities with Nawidemak's tomb, Bar. 6. ==References== ==Further reading== * (with images of the king's stela) Category:Kushite Monarchs Category:Amanikhabale Category:1st-century BCE monarchs of Kush",
