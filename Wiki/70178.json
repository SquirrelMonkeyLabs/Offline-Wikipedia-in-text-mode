 "text": "A tumulus (one tumulus, several tumuli) is a certain type of grave. The word comes from Latin. This way of burying people was common in the Stone age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. There are different layouts. Sometimes sarcophaguses were used, at other times, urns were placed in the grave. There are layouts with one or with multiple chambers. Sometimes the location is privileged, and stone circles can be found nearby. ==Related pages== *Kofun *Pyramid Category:Burial monuments and structures",
