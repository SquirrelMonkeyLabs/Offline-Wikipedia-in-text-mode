Because SC Schwanenstadt was 7th in the second league the new club could also play in this league. The first match was against FC Wacker Innsbruck (0-3). The rest of the season was more successful. They became champion of the second league and promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga. The club´s president was Frank Stronach, the founder of Magna Inetrnational. He was also the main sponsor. But he decided to leave the club, so the future of the club is not clear.
