 "text": "Iron sulfide is the chemical compound FeS, a black solid. It is made of iron and sulfide ions. FeS has iron in its +2 oxidation state. It reacts with acids such as hydrochloric acid to make hydrogen sulfide gas. In plural, \"iron sulfides\" may refer to a range of chemical compounds composed of iron and sulfur. For example to FeS2 (iron disulfide) found in the ground as the mineral pyrite. FeS2 is shiny like a metal and has a bright golden color. That's why it is sometimes called \"fool's gold\". ==Natural minerals== By increasing order of stability: * Iron(II) sulfide, FeS, the less stable amorphous form; * Greigite, a form of iron(II,III) sulfide (Fe3S4), analog to magnetite, Fe3O4; * Pyrrhotite, Fe1âˆ’xS (where x = 0 to 0.2), or Fe7S8; * Troilite, FeS, the endmember of pyrrhotite; * Mackinawite, Fe1+xS (where x = 0 to 0.1); * Marcasite, or iron(II) disulfide, FeS2 (orthorhombic); * Pyrite, or iron(II) disulfide, FeS2 (cubic), the more stable endmember, known as fool's gold.
