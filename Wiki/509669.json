 "text": "A dik-dik is a small antelope in the genus Madoqua that lives in the bushlands of eastern and southern Africa. Dik-diks stand about 30–40 cm (12–16 in) at the shoulder, are 50–70 cm (20–28 in) long, weigh 3–6 kg (7–16 lb) and can live for up to 10 years. Dik-diks are named after the alarm calls of the females. In addition to the females' alarm call, both males and females make a shrill, whistling sound. These calls may alert other animals to predators. The dik-dik is a favourite prey of the cheetah. There are four species: *Günther's dik-dik Madoqua guentheri *Kirk's dik-dik Madoqua kirkii *Silver dik-dik Madoqua piacentinii *Salt's dik-dik Madoqua saltiana == References == Category:Bovids Category:Mammals of Africa",
