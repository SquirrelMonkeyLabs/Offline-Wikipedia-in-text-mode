The group was started in 1972 by Velupillai Prabhakaran who was killed in battle against Sri Lanka's forces on May 18, 2009. Prabhakaran's body was cremated because the government did not want people to gather around his grave. There is also the Tamil Nadu Liberation Army who is currently fighting the Indian Army in South India. This group killed the third president of Sri Lanka, Ranasinghe Premadasa. == References == Category:Politics of Sri Lanka Category:Nationalist organizations in Asia Category:Rebel militia groups in Asia Category:1972 establishments in Asia Category:Tamils Category:Sri Lankan Civil War Category:1970s establishments in Sri Lanka Category:Organizations based in Sri Lanka",
