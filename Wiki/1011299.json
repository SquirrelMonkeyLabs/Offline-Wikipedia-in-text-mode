 "text": "The Suffry red-webbed tree frog or Bordeloi's tree frog (Zhangixalus suffry) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: the Suffry tea estate in India. People think it could live in Bhutan too. This frog lives in swampy places, but people have also seen it in banana farms and other farms. People have seen this frog between 60 and 1889 meters above sea level. Scientists believe this frog lives in trees and that its tadpoles swim in the water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Nameri National Park, Dihingpatkai Wildlife Sanctuary, and Namdapha Tiger Reserve. Scientists think that people cutting down forests and dangerous chemicals could harm this frog. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
