 "text": "A helping hand, also called a third hand is a tool for soldering. It has other uses too. A magnifying glass can be with it. It has adjustable clips to hold wires or other work parts. Benefits include better quality to soldered parts, no risk of burning hands, and easier work.The tool was invented by one William P. Rowing when he attempted to make various parts in his workstation into a pose-able miniature. He originally intended to fashion something that he could set into a fad he had began to show an interest in called: The Dab, however the alligator clamps and the magnifying glass turned out to be perfect for soldering and crafting more delicate pieces.
