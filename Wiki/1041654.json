 "text": "The Eastern Anatolia Region is a geographical region of Turkey. The province with most people is Van Province. Other provinces with lots of people are Malatya, Erzurum and Elazığ. It is next to the Black Sea Region and Georgia in the north, the Central Anatolia Region in the west, the Mediterranean Region in the southwest, the Southeastern Anatolia Region and Iraq in the south, and Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia in the east. The region includes most of Western Armenia and had a lot of Armenians until the Armenian genocide. The Anatolia peninsula never included what is now called \"Eastern Anatolia\". This is seen as an attempt by Turkey to erase the Armenian history of the region. It has the highest average altitude, largest geographical area, and lowest population density of the seven Turkish regions.",
