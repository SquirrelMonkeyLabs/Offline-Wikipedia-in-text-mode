 "text": "Monocotyledons are a class of flowering plants (angiosperms), whose embryo (seed) store only one cotyledon. The APG II system recognises a clade called \"monocots\" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank. You can recognize a monocot by its leaves: they have long parallel veins running down the leaf. In contrast, dicot plant leaves have a complex netted vein pattern on their leaves. Monocots usually have a fibrous root system. == Clade diagram == == Other websites == * APG II * Petrosaviales",
