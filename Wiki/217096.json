 "text": "A divergent boundary, also known as a constructive boundary, is two or more plates that move apart from each other because of plate tectonics. When they move apart either water or magma fills the space. If it is magma, when it has cooled it then creates a new plate which then creates new land. Earthquakes along this plate boundary are relatively small Category:Geology",
