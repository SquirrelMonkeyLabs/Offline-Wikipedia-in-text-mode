The skin of the frog's back is gray in color with light brown or olive brown marks. It does not have stripes or marks on its sides, chest, or belly. There is orange-yellow color on its throat. The male frog's male organs are white in color. The iris of the eye is bronze in color. ==Food== The adult frogs eat ants, termites, beetles, and other animals with no bones. Scientists believe this frog will eat whatever it can catch. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in rainfrests. Scientists saw them on mud in ditches near roads in Sierra de Lema. Scientists saw the frog between 850 and 1300 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog inside a protected park, Canaima National Park. ==Young== The tadpoles swim in slow-moving streams where the water is 5â€“10 cm deep and under rocks in small pools. ==Danger== Scientists do not know exactly how much danger this frog is in. Too many visitors come to its forests. People cut down too many trees in the frog's home to make roads and power lines for electricity. Gold mines put bad chemicals in the streams that the frogs need. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
