There are three areas in the Northeastern Woodlands. The coastal area runs from South Carolina up to Canada. Saint Lawrence Lowlands includes parts of Ontario and New York. The Great Lakes- Riverine area is around the Great Lakes. There are different landscapes in the region. They include coasts, forests, mountains and lowlands. The Northeastern Woodlands are surrounded by the Subartic, Great Plains and Southeastern Woodlands. Algonquian, Iroquoian, or Siouan are the three language groups of the area. == Language Groups and Tribes == Algonquian-speaking tribes are Abenaki, Accomac, Delaware (Lenape), Fox, Illinois, Kickapoo, Malecite, Massachusett, Menominee, Miami, Mi’kmaq (Micmac), Mohegan, Mohican (Mahican) Montauk, Nanticoke, Niantic, Nipmuc, Narragansett, Nauset, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Pennacook.

The Algonquian and Iroquoian tribes developed around 1100. This was in present-day New England.Klein, Milton M. (ed.) and the New York State Historical Association, The Empire State: A History of New York, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, New York, 2001, ISBN 0-8014-3866-7 The Iroquois was a powerful confederacy of tribes from about 1400 to 1700 CE.Horatio Gates Spafford, LL.D.

They were forced off their lands by Europeans. The Powhatan Confederacy (Tsenacommacah) were tribes in present-day Virginia. Chief Powhatan was the father of Pocahontas. The region of the Powhatan was the first area that British settled, including Jamestown. == Culture == Northeast Woodland Natives usually lived in wigwams or longhouses. They traded wampum, which were shell beads. Natives used the birchbark canoe for hunting, warfare and fishing. The main crops were the Three Sisters. This included winter squash, maize (corn), and climbing beans. They were grown together to improve growth.Mount Pleasant, Jane (2006). \"The science behind the Three Sisters mound system: An agronomic assessment of an indigenous agricultural system in the northeast\".

Men usually planted and harvested, while women processed plants. The clan was an important social group. They were often named after animals like the bear, hawk, turtle or wolf. Natives believed in spiritual force that was everywhere. Manitou was the spiritual life force. It could reveal itself as the Great Spirit.Bragdon, Kathleen J. (2001). The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Northeast. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 18.
