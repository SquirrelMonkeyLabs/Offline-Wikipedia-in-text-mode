 "text": "A British princess is a princess who has the title of a Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In Britain, the title \"Princess\" and the use of the style \"Royal Highness\" can only be used for these persons: * the legitimate daughters of a British sovereign, * the legitimate male line granddaughters of a British sovereign, * the wife of a British prince. Queen Elizabeth II issued Letters Patent dated 21 August 1996 stating that any woman divorced from a Prince of the United Kingdom would no longer be entitled to the style \"Royal Highness\".
