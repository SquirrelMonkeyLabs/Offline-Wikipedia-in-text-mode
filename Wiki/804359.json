The album was a success. ==Artwork== The artwork for Even Worse parodies the famous cover of Michael Jackson's album Bad, which depicts Michael Jackson wearing the same outfit which would be in his music video for Bad, while for Even Worse, Weird Al is wearing a similar styled leather outfit to Michael's outfit. Weird Al would then wear that outfit again for the music video for Fat. Category:1988 albums Category:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic",
