 "text": "\"My Plague\" is the third single off American metal band Slipknot's second studio album Iowa. The song was released on July 8, 2002. == Overview == There was a remix for the song called \"New Abuse Mix\" that was featured on the soundtrack to the 2002 movie Resident Evil. the remix cut a screamed layer of vocals and replaced it with a more monotone, drone-like sounding layer. == Versions == The new version was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional \"Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you\" section. Some of the profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; like the phrase \"...the everyday bullshit things that you have done\" was changed to, \"...the everyday abusive things that you have done\" and \"You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart...\" was replaced with \"...and if you touch me, I will rip you apart...\". The whole second verse of the chorus was removed. In 2003, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Metal Performance category but it lost to Korn's \"Here to Stay\". ==References== ==Other websites== * * * (New Abuse Mix) Category:2001 songs Category:Slipknot songs",
