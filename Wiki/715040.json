 "text": "Antone Charles \"Tony\" Costa (August 2, 1944 â€“ May 12, 1974) was an American carpenter who achieved notoriety for committing serial murders in and around the town of Truro, Massachusetts in 1969. Costa preyed on either teenaged girls or young women, although it is unclear which, which resulted in the victims' deaths. Costa would then remove the corpses' hearts and dismember the corpses. Costa was convicted of two of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment by Massachusetts. Four years into his imprisonment, Costa hanged himself in his prison cell. == References == Category:1944 births Category:1974 deaths Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:American serial killers Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Suicides by hanging in the United States",
