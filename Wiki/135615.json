 "text": "Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908 – May 2, 1957) was an American politician. He was a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period of intense anti-communist suspicion inspired by the tensions of the Cold War. He made Americans aware that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside the federal government and elsewhere. The term \"McCarthyism,\" coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist pursuits. During World War II he was a captain in the United States Marine Corps. McCarthy died of hepatitis at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. ==Other websites== * * * Retrieved on 2008-07-11 |- Category:1908 births Category:1957 deaths Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Anti-communists Category:Deaths from hepatitis Category:Infectious disease deaths in Maryland Category:United States senators from Wisconsin Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni Category:Military people from Wisconsin Category:United States Marine Corps personnel",
