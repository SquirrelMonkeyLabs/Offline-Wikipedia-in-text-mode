He was characterized by the fact that he showed a high willingness to run and was outstanding in both defensive and offensive areas. Already at the age of 21 he became a national player and played for the Celeste for the first time in 1939.

The highlight of his career was the 1950 World Cup, when Uruguay defeated the Brazilian team 2-1 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. Varela was the captain of this team and led it to victory. In the crucial last game of the final group of four (everyone against everyone else), Brazil needed only a draw against Uruguay to become world champions and were up 1-0 early in the second half. But Uruguay prevailed, scoring twice in front of a crowd of 200,000. This victory, also known as the “Maracanaço”, was considered a miracle. It made a myth and immortalized Varela in the eyes of Uruguay's football-loving population. At the age of 36 he traveled to Switzerland with the national team to defend the title at the 1954 World Cup. At the time, he was the oldest player to have ever played in a World Cup. Scotland and Czechoslovakia were easily beaten in the preliminary round before Uruguay beat England 4-2 in the quarter-finals. Varela sustained a leg injury in that game. There were no substitutes back then, so he had to play the full 90 minutes heavily bandaged to the end. Varela and two other key players did not recover in time for the semi-final against Hungary, and Uruguay lost 4-2 after extra time. Varela ended his World Cup career undefeated after seven games. Overall, Varela completed 45 international matches from his debut on January 29, 1939 to his last match on June 26, 1954, in which he scored nine goals. ==Managerial career== In 1955, when he retired from football, Varela briefly tried to retrain as a coach on the Peñarol bench, with Roque Máspoli, but he quickly abandoned the idea. ==Death== Varela died on August 2, 1996.
