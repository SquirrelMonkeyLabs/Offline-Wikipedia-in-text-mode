 "text": "The Iranian toman (; from Mongolian tomen 'unit of ten thousand'), is the superunit of the official currency used in Iran, the rial. One toman is equal to ten rials. Even though the rial is the official currency, Iranians use the toman daily. In the beginning, the toman consisted of 10,000 dinars. Between 1798 and 1825, the toman was split into eight rials, each of 1,250 dinars. In 1825, the qiran was introduced. The qiran was worth 1,000 dinars or one-tenth of a toman. == References == Category:Currency of Asia Category:History of Mongolia Category:History of Persia",
