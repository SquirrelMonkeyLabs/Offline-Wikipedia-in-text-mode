The town was started to support the nearby alunite (a source of potash) mine at nearby Lake Campion. The mine was a state government project with government employees. A potash works was built in the town in 1943. After World War II, the government closed down the plant. Australian Plaster Industries started production of gypsum in 1949 that is used to make plaster of paris and plasterboard. Then, the town grew and had two main streets, over 70 houses, a telephone exchange, a school, and powerhouse. Production stopped in 1952. The whole town was sold off in 1953. The town was named after Mr J Chandler, a farmer, who had discovered the alunite deposits. ==References== Category:Ghost towns in Australia",
