 "text": "Copper(II) nitrate, also known as cupric nitrate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Cu(NO3)2. It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains nitrate ions. ==Properties== Copper(II) nitrate is a blue solid. It is an oxidizing agent. It is blue whether it contains water (hydrated) or not (anhydrous). It makes nitrogen dioxide when it is heated. ==Preparation== It is made by reacting copper with nitrogen tetroxide. It can also be made by reacting copper with nitric acid or silver nitrate. ==Uses== It can be used to make nitric acid by heating it. Then the brown gas made is dissolved in water to make nitric acid. It can be used to add nitrate ions to organic chemicals. ==Safety== Copper ions are toxic, like many other metals. Nitrates are oxidizing agents and can make things burn. ==Related pages== *Copper(I) chloride *Copper sulfate Category:Copper compounds Category:Nitrates",
