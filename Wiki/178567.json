In most cases, it is also activated by nicotine or cocaine. It can also be activated by marijuana. == Age-related decline in dopamine == A number of studies have reported an age- related decline in making dopamine. There is also a drop the number of dopamine receptors in the brain. The reduction of dopamine with aging may be responsible for neurological symptoms which increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility (~ thinking). == References == Category:Molecular biology Category:Neuroscience Category:Organonitrogen compounds",
