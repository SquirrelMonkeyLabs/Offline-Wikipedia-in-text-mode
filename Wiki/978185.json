 "text": "\"Oh, Beautiful Virgin Islands\" is the anthem of the British Virgin Islands. ==Lyrics== I Out of the huts of history’s pain Our ancestors bled and died! But with strength and willpower we overcame To restore Virgin Islands pride! To preserve our beauty we devised a plan To obtain ownership of your precious lands! Educating our people is the golden key To maintain the success of this Territory! Oh how radiant are your daughters! And how wealthy are your sons! Your beaches boast your beauty! And your success is second to none! Green and brilliant are your hillsides! They replenish our hopes and pride! Oh Beautiful Virgin Islands! Your qualities can never be denied! II We shall protect your bountiful shores And uphold your dignity! We shall fight to preserve your culture Your splendour and integrity! And we shall never fail to understand How blessed we are to possess this land! So we shall unite standing proud and tall Let none divide us, lest we fall! III May God richly bless this territory! May we ask three things of thee… Courage for our great leaders That they may rule our destiny! We ask for wisdom for our people That we may live in harmony! And understanding for children So they may cherish this legacy! ==References== Category:British Virgin Islands Category:North American anthems",
