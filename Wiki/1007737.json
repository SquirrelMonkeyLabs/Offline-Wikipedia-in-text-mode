 "text": "V437 Scuti is a red supergiant star in the constellation of Scutum. If you placed it in the Solar System, It would consume Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and dwarf planet Ceres. This makes it comparable to the size of Betelgeuse, Antares, and Rho Cassiopeiae. It is not likely that it has planets, but there is a small chance that it may be a binary star. == Related pages == Other stars in Scutum: * UY Scuti * Alpha Scuti Category:Stars Category:Red giants Category:Supergiants",
