 "text": "Tiep or thieb is a traditional dish from Senegambia. It is also eaten in Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Mali and Mauritania. It is the national dish in Senegal. The version of tiep called thieboudienne or chebu jen is made with fish, broken rice and tomato sauce cooked in one pot. There are also tiep yappa (with meat) and tiep ganaar (with chicken). Other ingredients often include onions, carrots, cabbage, cassava, hot pepper, lime and peanut oil, and stock cubes. == History == Tiep is thought to have come from Saint-Louis, in the nineteenth century. The name of the dish comes from Wolof words meaning 'rice' () and 'fish' (). In Pulaar it is known as ('rice and fish'). It is served on large trays with the rice on the bottom and the fish, usually white grouper (Epinephelus aeneus), and the vegetables, many of them whole, in the center. == Serving == Traditionally it is eaten in a large shared dish with the hand. It is also the symbol of Senegalese terranga (hospitality). Family, visiting friends and guests gather around a single dish (called a bolus) from which everyone eats using a spoon (couddou Pulaar) or a piece of bread. ==References== == Other websites == * Senegal Travel Guide, World Travel Guide * agricultural situation country report, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service,Mbalo Ndiaye,2007 * Food and daily life, Our Africa * Duffy, Megan, \"Ceeb ak Jën: Deconstructing Senegal’s National Plate in Search of Cultural Values\" (2009).
