 "text": "LIBRIS is the online catalog of the Swedish national library system. It combines the catalogs of 175 libraries in Sweden. The catalog is run by the Swedish National Library in Stockholm. LIBRIS has authority controls. It also has bibliographical information about the books held in Sweden's libraries and which libraries hold the books. The LIBRIS database is linked to the Semantic Web. The LIBRIS project was begun in 1970. In 2011 the bibliography and authority files were released into the public domain. As of 2014, LIBRIS contained approximately seven million separate book titles.Olssen, Lena (2006). \"Great Expectations\" in History of Computing and Education 2, pp. 59-65. Springer.
