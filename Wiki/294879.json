 "text": "Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an ongoing series of books written by Jeff Kinney. There are nineteenth books in the main series. The series is about a middle school student named Greg Heffley. The books are written in the style of Greg's diary. They contain many drawings, all with no color. These books are about Gregory Heffley, who is most commonly known as Greg. He struggles with middle school and family life. Greg has one close friend named Rowley Jefferson. He goes to public school where he has multiple crushes including Holly Hills, known as Piper Elizabeth Mattews in the online version. The series is very successful, leading to many movie adaptations and popularity among children aged eight to twelve. ==Main Characters== *Greg Heffley is a middle school student who wants to be popular. He gets upset when things don't usually go his way. He is addicted to video games. *Rodrick Heffley is Greg's older brother. He is a teenager, later on an adult who likes heavy metal music. Rodrick plays the drums in his band, Löded Diper. *Manny Heffley is Greg's younger brother. Greg thinks that his parents like Manny more than him and Rodrick. Manny’s parents spoil (do good things for) him. *Frank Heffley is Greg's father. He thinks Greg is weak. Frank wants Greg to stop playing video games and play sports instead. *Susan Heffley is Greg's mother. She is nice, but does not know very much about things that Greg and Rodrick like. She does not like technology and smartphones. *Rowley Jefferson is Greg's best friend. Greg sees Rowley as immature and childish because he acts younger than he actually is. Rowley has also made journals (he was inspired by his best friend Greg). His journal is about his and Greg's middle school life and their ordinary lives. == Minor Characters == * Holly Hills is a popular girl at Greg's school. Greg has a crush on her in the early books but it seems like she doesn't like him back. She has a larger role in the movies. * Chirag Gupta is a student at Greg's school who Greg was friends with. After Chirag moves away but returns not long after, Greg makes the rest of the school pretend that Chirag is invisible. * Fregley is an annoying character who lives in Greg’s neighborhood. Greg doesn't like Fregley and once crawled through a sewer to avoid passing by his house. Greg has reason to dislike Fregley because he often does strange and disgusting actions. Fregley appears in nine of the books, but lately has not been mentioned. * Patty Farrell is another student at Greg's school. She is disliked by everyone in the class because she is very rude to everyone else. In the movies, she is portrayed as Greg's enemy. * Nasty Pants is a 5-year-old character who does not like guests in his house. He is known to bully Greg and Rowley whenever they walk in his neighborhood. He appears in Cabin Fever and Wrecking Ball. * Mackie is one of Rodrick's friends and is a former member of Löded Diper. He got accepted in a school for robotics and appears in Diper Överlöde. * Drew is one of Rodrick's friends, and is a former member of Löded Diper. Drew has an older brother who works at the Deli Counter and lets the band play a song over the speakers. The song only played for thirty seconds before the manager turned it and fired Drew’s brother. He appears in Diper Överlöde. * Bill Walter is the main singer of Löded Diper. He is the only member of Rodrick’s band to not be in high school. In high school, Bill was voted to be “Most Likely to become a Rock Star”, and this is why Rodrick invited him to join his band. Bill appears in five of the books, and was a major character in Diper Överlöde. * Christopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to attract lots of mosquitos while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers told them they would call all of their parents. ==Books== List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid Books Number in series Name Published 1 Diary of a Wimpy Kid April 1, 2007 2 Rodrick Rules February 1, 2008 3 The Last Straw January 1, 2009 4 Dog Days October 12, 2009 5 The Ugly Truth November 9, 2010 6 Cabin Fever November 15, 2011 7 The Third Wheel November 13, 2012 8 Hard Luck November 5, 2013 9 The Long Haul November 4, 2014 10 Old School November 3, 2015 11 Double Down November 1, 2016 12 The Getaway November 7, 2017 13 The Meltdown October 30, 2018 14 Wrecking Ball November 5, 2019 15 The Deep End October 27, 2020 16 Big Shot October 26, 2021 17 Diper Överlöde October 25, 2022 18 No Brainer October 24, 2023 19 Hot Mess October 22, 2024 A book called Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal was released.
