The area is divided into a new industrial estate and the old village by the B 191 federal road that runs from Celle to Eschede and Uelzen. The industrial estate includes a post office distribution centre. The railway line from Celle to Wittingen runs past the edge of Altenhagen, but the station at Altenhagen has rarely been used since it was closed to passenger services. ==References== == Other websites == * The official website for Celle town Category:Celle",
