 "text": "Hypsiboas hypselops is a nomina inquirenda. That means it is a name that scientists could give to a species, but it is not the name of any real species right now. In the 1870s, Edward Drinker Cope and his team of scientists found a frog in South America. They decided to name it Hypsiboas hypselops. But they did not write down exactly where they found it. Their notes said \"Pebas, Equador.\" Today, scientists think Cope and his team found one of the frogs in Boana but they do not know which one. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Taxonomy",
