 "text": "\"On Saudi Arabia: Its People, Past, Religion, Fault Lines—and Future\" is a book by American journalist Karen Elliott House. Based on over 30 years of visits to the country, House explores Saudi Arabia’s history, people, religion, and political challenges. The book discusses human rights, global politics, and the internal divisions within the kingdom. It also suggests how diplomacy could support gradual reforms for a better future. \"On Saudi Arabia\" is divided into three parts. The first part looks at the kingdom’s weakening foundations—its religion and royal family—both of which are losing influence. The second part explores deep social problems, including poor education, high youth unemployment, limited rights for women, poverty, corruption, and an inefficient, unaccountable government. ==References== Category:Books",
