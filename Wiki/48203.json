 "text": "The Battle of Bosworth, or Battle of Bosworth Field, was the last important battle during the Wars of the Roses in 15th-century England. It was fought on 22 August 1485 between the Yorkist king, Richard III, the last of the Plantagenet dynasty, and the Lancastrian Henry Tufor, who wanted to become king. It ended in Richard's defeat and death and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Historically, the battle is thought to have marked the end of the Wars of the Roses although smaller battles were fought in the years that followed, as Yorkists unsuccessfully tried to become king again.
