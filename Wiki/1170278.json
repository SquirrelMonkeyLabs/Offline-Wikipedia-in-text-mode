 "text": "The Yacambu poison frog or Yacambú collared frog (Mannophryne yustizi) is a frog. It lives on Tobago Island and Little Tobago Island in Trinidad and Tobago. ==Home== This frog lives near streams in forests on mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 1200 and 1800 meters above sea level. Scientists found the frog two protected parks, Yacambú National Park and Terepaima National Park. ==Young== The female frogs lay eggs on land. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. In some places, human beings cut down forests to make big farms for coffee and places to have animals. The chemicals the farmers use to make plants grow can also hurt the frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
