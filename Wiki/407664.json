 "text": "WWE 2K14 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's & Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game was released on October 29, 2013 in North America, October 30, 2013 in Japan, October 31, 2013 in Australia, and November 1, 2013 in both Europe and India. It is the first game in the WWE 2K video game series and the first WWE game to be released under 2K Sports since Take-Two acquired the license from THQ in a bankruptcy filing. This game, along with NBA 2K14, were planned for Wii U releases, but were canceled. Dwayne Johnson is the cover athlete of the game. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 8.7 out of 10 and said \"It still lacks the brains to deliver competent AI and commentators, but WWE 2K14 has more than enough brawn to make up for it. 30 Years of Wrestlemania provides the strongest campaign backbone the series has had in a long time, the in-ring action is faster and more fluid than it's been in years, and thanks to WWE 2K14s continually expanding creation suite, we're swimming in more options than we ever knew we wanted. It is indeed \"time to play the game.\" GameSpot gave the game a 6 out of 10 and said that the game was clunky, they stated \"It's a shame the wrestling isn't up to par in WWE 2K14 because the elements surrounding it are so interesting...For anyone who grew up loving professional wrestling, be prepared to be swept away in a tide of nostalgia. If only the core action could have been as compelling.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2013 video games Category:2K Sports games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Professional wrestling video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:WWE video games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Yuke's games",
