 "text": "The Merida rocket frog (Aromobates meridensis) is a frog. It lives in Sierra de la Culata in MÃ©rida, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams high in cloud forests in the Andes mountains. These streams are narrow with many plants where they meet the ground. Scientists saw the frog between 1800 and 3300 meters above sea level. Scientists saw the frog in Protective Zone of the Capaz River and the place where the frog lives is near La Culata National Park. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on dead leaves on the ground. The male frog watches the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to pools near the streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in very big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make farms and places for people to raise animals. Scientists believe the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis could give the frogs the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. They also think climate change and ultraviolet light could hurt the frogs, eggs, and tadpoles. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
