 "text": "The \"Mongolian spot\" is a clear bluishgrey mark on newborns back. It completely disappears at the age of 12-14 months. It is not so big as a penny in diameter. This is mainly due to the accumulation of melamine pigment in the dermis. This name was given mainly due to the fact that it was first discovered in Mongolian children. In fact, it is observed not only in people belonging to the Mongoloid race, but also in members of other races. These spots are found in 90% of Asian children. The \"Mongolian spot\" is also observed in the peoples of Europe. An example of this are the Roma people. ==References== Category:Medical signs",
