 "text": "The Chical nubulous stream frog (Hyloscirtus conscientia) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 1495 and 1750 meters above sea level. They think it might live in Colombia too. The adult male frog is about 29.6â€“33.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 34.7 to 40 mm long. Frogs can be different colors, but they are lighter in color on the sides than on the back. They are ususally yellow-green with a brown stripe. Scientists named thsi frog after the Latin idea conscientia for consciousness. An Ecuadorian teenager chose it. She said human beings had to stop these frogs from dying by using less water. Another teenager chose the name \"nubular\" even though it is not a word in either Spanish or English. It sounds like the Spanish word for \"cloudy,\" and the frog lives in cloudy places. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
