 "text": "Area code 513 and 283 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan. It covers the southwestern part of Ohio, including cities like Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Middletown. Area code 513 was established in 1947 as one of the original area codes and originally served the entire state of Ohio. Over time, as the demand for phone numbers increased, area code 513 was split by 937 in 1996 and overlaid by 283 on April 28, 2023, although 283 was first introduced back in 2000. == References == 513",
