 "text": "The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF) is a space telescope launched by NASA on July 23, 1999. Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope. This is done by the high angular resolution of its mirrors.Chandra X-ray Observatory Quick Facts. NASA.gov. August 1999. FS-1999-09-111-MSFC. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, Earth-based telescopes cannot detect them. Space-based telescopes are needed to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2024. Chandra is one of the Great Observatories, with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991â€“2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The telescope is named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.\"And the co-winners are...\".
