 "text": "The Rockstone poison dart frog (Dendrobates nubeculosus) is a frog. It lives in Guyana. ==Body== The adult frog is about 24.5 mm long from nose to rear end. Scientists think the male frog is larger than the female frog. Scientists studied one frog: The skin of its back was black or dark brown in color with big blue marks and some light spots. There was blue and black color on its sides. Its belly was all black. ==Name== Scientists gave this frog the English name \"Rockstone\" because they found it near a town named Rockstone. They gave it the Latin name nebulosus because that means \"covered in small clouds.\" ==Home== Scientists found this frog in exactly one place: an evergreen forest that was flooded. They found it near streams. Scientists found this frog 7 meters above sea level. ==Young== Scientists believe this frog hatches out of its egg as a tadpole because other frogs in Dendrobates do. ==Danger== Scientists do not know whether this frog is at risk of dying out. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
