 "text": "The WAGR Ks class were a total of 6 steam locomotives operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1915 to 1928. The Ks class were the result of superheating the standard K class 2-8-4 of 1893. Only six of the twenty-four total were superheated as by this time most were working as shunting meaning superheating them wasn't economically viable. All but one were converted back to K class engines. Category:Western Australian Government Railways locomotives",
