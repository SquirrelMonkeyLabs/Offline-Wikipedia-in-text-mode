 "text": "Planet of the Apes is an American science fiction media franchise consisting of movies, books, television series, comics, and other media about a post- apocalyptic world in which humans and smart apes fight for control as the lead species. The franchise started with French author Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel La Plan√®te des singes. Distributed by 20th Century Fox, the novel's first movie adaptation was the 1968 movie Planet of the Apes, which was followed four sequels: Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972), Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). While the development of another movie was paused, a live-action television series was released in 1974 and an animated series was released in 1975. The next movie ended up being Planet of the Apes (2001), a remake of the first movie directed by Tim Burton. The movie's sequel was canceled and a rebooted series later began in 2011, with the release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). Two sequels, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes, were released in 2014 and 2017, respectively. When Disney bought Fox in 2019, plans for another movie started. The fourth part of the rebooted series, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, was released in 2024. Five more movies are in development. Planet of the Apes has totally made more than $2 billion around the world, against a combined budget of $567.5 million. As a whole, the franchise has gotten mostly positive reviews, especially the original movie and the rebooted series. It is the oldest science fiction movie franchise to still release movies. == Movies == Number Title Release date Director Continuity 1 Planet of the Apes Franklin J.
