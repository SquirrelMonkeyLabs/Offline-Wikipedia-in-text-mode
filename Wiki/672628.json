It is a member of the Asian Football Confederation, and became a member of FIFA in 1974. Even though the Bangladesh Football Federation was first founded in 1972. Bangladesh was elected as a member of the AFC Executive Committee in 1982–1986 and 1998–2002. The current Executive Committee was elected democratically, under an AFC approved constitution and direct supervision of FIFA & AFC, in April 2008. ==Team image== ===Colours=== The Bangladesh national football team plays in bottle green shirts and dark red shorts embedded. Also with red and green stripes. Green and red are the historic national colours of Bangladesh, originating from the national flag of Bangladesh. The red represents the sun rising over Bengal, and also the blood of those who died for the independence of Bangladesh. The green stands for the lushness of the land of Bangladesh. The current Bangladesh away jersey is completely diametric to the regular one. ===Home stadium=== Bangladesh plays majority of their home matches at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka, where they won the SAFF Championship in 2003 and 2010 South Asian Games football gold medal. The Bangabandhu National Stadium also hosted both 2009 and 2018 SAFF Championships. Occasionally home matches are also played at MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong, Sylhet District Stadium in Sylhet, Rajshahi District Stadium in Rajshahi and Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore. Since 2020, the Bangabandhu National Stadium was once again used as the teams home venue and after the 2021 Bangladesh Premier League season, the stadium went under a year-long renovation process, as BFF have planned to organize both Bangladesh Football League and future football related events on the ground. ===Media coverage=== Bangladesh's home and away qualifiers and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on Bangladesh Television , Bangla TV & T Sports (Bangladesh). ==Results and fixtures== Matches in the last 12 months, and future scheduled matches ===2021=== ==Coaching staff== Position Name Head Coach Javier Cabrera Assistant Coaches Masud Parvez Kawsar Goalkeeper Coach Biplob Bhattacharjee Fitness Coach Ivan Razlog Team Physio Fuad Hasan Hawlader Manager Satyajit Das Rupu BFF Technical Director Paul Smalley ===Coaching history=== :Interim coaches are listed in italics. * Sheikh Saheb Ali (1972–1975) * Abdur Rahim (1975) * Anjam Hossain (1976) * Werner Bickelhaupt (1978–1979) * Zakaria Pintoo (1979) * Gofur Baluch (1982) * Gerd Schmidt (1982) * Golam Sarwar Tipu (1984) * Ali Imam (1984) * Kazi Salahuddin (1985–1988) * Abdul Hakim (1986) * Wazed Gazi (1987) * Nasser Hejazi (1989) * Pran Govinda Kunda (1989) * Shahid Uddin Ahmed Selim (1991) * Mohammad Kaikobad (1992) * Oldrich Swab (1993) * Kang Man-young (1994) * Otto Pfister (1995–1997) * Abu Yusuf (1998) * Samir Shaker (1998–1999) * Mark Harrison (2000) * Hasanuzzaman Bablu (2000) * György Kottán (2000–2003) * Golam Sarwar Tipu (2003) * Andres Cruciani (2005–2007) * Hasanuzzaman Bablu (2006) * Sayeed Hassan Kanan (2007-2008) * Syed Nayeemuddin (2007–2008) * Abu Yusuf (2008) * Shafiqul Islam Manik (2008) * Dido (2009) * Shahidur Rahman Shantoo (2009) * Zoran Đorđević (2010) * Saiful Bari Titu (2010) * Robert Rubčić (2010–2011) * Nikola Ilievski (2011) * Saiful Bari Titu (2012) * Lodewijk de Kruif (2013–2014) * Saiful Bari Titu (2014–2015) * Lodewijk de Kruif (2015) * Fabio Lopez (2015) * Maruful Haque (2015–2016) * Gonzalo Sanchez Moreno (2016) * Lodewijk de Kruif (2016) * Tom Saintfiet (2016) * Andrew Ord (2017–2018) * Jamie Day (2018–2022) * Óscar Bruzón (2021) * Mário Lemos (2021) * Javier Cabrera (2022–present) ===Coaching record=== Coach From To Mark Harrison April 2000 May 2000 Hasanuzzaman Bablu July 2000 August 2000 György Kottán November 2000 January 2003 Golam Sarwar Tipu 22 November 2003 December 2003 Andres Cruciani 3 August 2005 10 April 2006 Hasanuzzaman Bablu February 2006 November 2006 Syed Nayeemuddin 1 August 2007 31 December 2007 Abu Yusuf 5 March 2008 18 June 2008 Shafiqul Islam Manik 18 August 2008 13 November 2008 Dido 1 January 2009 9 November 2009 Shahidur Rahman Shantoo 9 November 2009 11 December 2009 Saiful Bari Titu 16 February 2010 20 February 2010 Robert Rubčić 3 September 2010 2 June 2011 Nikola Ilievski 24 June 2011 22 December 2011 Saiful Bari Titu 2 September 2012 20 November 2012 Lodewijk de Kruif 29 January 2013 14 October 2014 Saiful Bari Titu 18 October 2014 27 October 2014 Lodewijk de Kruif 24 January 2015 8 September 2015 Fabio Lopez 11 September 2015 24 November 2015 Maruful Haque 25 November 2015 18 January 2016 Gonzalo Sanchez Moreno 23 February 2016 24 March 2016 Lodewijk de Kruif 7 May 2016 7 June 2016 Tom Saintfiet 26 June 2016 10 October 2016 Andrew Ord 18 May 2017 4 April 2018 Jamie Day 17 May 2018 17 September 2021 Óscar Bruzón 17 September 2021 20 October 2021 Mário Lemos 21 October 2021 7 January 2022 Javier Cabrera 8 January 2022 Present ==Players== ===Current squad=== The following 23 players were named to the final squad for the 2021 Mahinda Rajapaksa Trophy.
