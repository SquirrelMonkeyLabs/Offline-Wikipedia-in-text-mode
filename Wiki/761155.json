Interval analysis: theory and applications. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 121(1-2), 421-464. It is mainly used for the automated detection of errors. There is a value, which isn't known exactly, but which can be given by an interval: the value is known to be inside the interval. There's a function to calculate the error. This function should be given the unknown value, but instead can only be given the interval. The result is a function which will map intervals. Interval arithmetic can be used to treat rounding errors, or to treat insecurities with measurements: Each measurement has a certain error, which cannot be determined exactly. ==Definition== For real intervals (interval of real numbers), interval arithmetic is defined as follows: * Addition: [x_1, x_2] + [y_1, y_2] = [x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2] * Subtraction: [x_1, x_2] - [y_1, y_2] = [x_1-y_2, x_2-y_1] * Multiplication: [x_1, x_2] \\cdot [y_1, y_2] = [\\min(x_1 y_1,x_1 y_2,x_2 y_1,x_2 y_2), \\max(x_1 y_1,x_1 y_2,x_2 y_1,x_2 y_2)] * Division: ::\\frac{[x_1, x_2]}{[y_1, y_2]} = [x_1, x_2] \\cdot \\frac{1}{[y_1, y_2]}, :where ::\\begin{align} \\frac{1}{[y_1, y_2]} &= \\left [\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\right ] && 0 otin [y_1, y_2] \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{[y_1, 0]} &= \\left [-\\infty, \\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\right ] \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{[0, y_2]} &= \\left [\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\infty \\right ] \\\\\\ \\frac{1}{[y_1, y_2]} &= \\left [-\\infty, \\tfrac{1}{y_1} \\right ] \\cup \\left [\\tfrac{1}{y_2}, \\infty \\right ] = [-\\infty, \\infty] && 0 \\in (y_1, y_2) \\end{align} ==Applications== Interval arithmetic is mainly used in the field of validated numerics.Tucker, W. (2011). Validated Numerics: A Short Introduction to Rigorous Computations. Princeton University Press. It is also used in other technical areas.Jaulin, L. Kieffer, M., Didrit, O. Walter, E. (2001). Applied Interval Analysis. Berlin: Springer. ==Implementations== Since the birth of interval arithmetic, many experts have made interval arithmetic programs. The most famous works are INTLAB (made with MATLAB),S.M. Rump: INTLAB - INTerval LABoratory. In Tibor Csendes, editor, Developments in Reliable Computing, pages 77-104.
