 "text": "Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell ( ; born December 18, 2001) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. She is currently signed to Interscope Records. ==Career== ===2015=== On November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song \"Ocean Eyes\". The track was written, mixed and produced by her brother Finneas. She released her first EP, don't smile at me, in 2017. ===2019=== Her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, was released on March 29, 2019. It features the songs \"Bury a Friend\", \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", \"When the Party's Over\", \"Wish You Were Gay\", and her first number-one hit, \"Bad Guy\". The album reached number one in the UK, making her the youngest woman to top the UK Albums Chart. ===2020=== In February 2020, Eilish released her single \"No Time to Die\", the official James Bond theme for the movie of the same name. 17 years old at the time of recording, Eilish is the youngest artist to have recorded a James Bond theme in the history of the franchise. For this, she won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. ===2021=== Her second studio album, Happier Than Ever, was released July 30, 2021. ===2023=== On July 13, 2023, she released the song \"What Was I Made For?\" for the soundtrack of the movie Barbie. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 96th Academy Awards, making her the youngest person to win two Academy Awards. ==Artistry== Eilish's musical style has been compared to New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde and American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. Her songs are considered dark. ===Vocal range=== Eilish has a three octave soubrette soprano vocal range. She has a soft, light, and airy voice that has become synonymous with an entire style of singing. As Eilish has risen to incredible career heights, she has likewise inspired many aspiring musicians and singers to mimic her artistry. When Eilish sings low notes below G3 at a soft volume, she drop her breath support to phonate, but when singing at a louder or medium volume, she can carry a fuller tone down to E3. This shows that she has the capability to sing with \"better\" technique, she may purposefully opt not to in order to further her emotional deliveries. ==Reception== Eilish is well-known for her sensitive and emotive deliveries on songs like \"When The Party’s Over\", she has also committed to colorful character deliveries like on her signature hit \"Bad Guy\". While she has come under criticism for her \"whispery\" vocals, Eilish demonstrates considerable control of her voice. This raises the point that as Eilish often sings at very soft volumes, it has led some to take digs at her vocals for being simply \"whispers\", with a converse preference for louder vocalists. ==Personal life== Eilish is of Scottish and Irish descent. She is bisexual. She has an older brother, Finneas, who works with her on her musical projects. She was part of the Los Angeles Children's Chorus and was home-schooled with her brother. Her mother is actress Maggie Baird. Eilish has Tourette syndrome. ===Health=== She also has synesthesia. Eilish has also been through depression. She suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts at age 11 and expressed her depression through her music. However, some accused her of romanticizing death and mental illnesses. ==Discography== * When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?
