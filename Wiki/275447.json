 "text": "Down quarks (sometimes written as a \"d\") are very small particles that help make up many larger particles, like protons and neutrons. Down quarks have a charge of -1/3. Since Down quarks are fermions (which means that no two of them can exist in the same space at the same time), they have a spin of 1/2. Down quarks are the second lightest quark, the first being up quarks. The antiparticle of a down quark is a down antiquark, or simply an antidown. == References == Category:Quarks",
