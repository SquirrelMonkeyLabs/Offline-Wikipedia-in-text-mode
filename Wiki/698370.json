In the 19th century it was Morrisania, owned by the Morris family. Late in the 19th century they sold most the land and it became an industrial suburb. The South Bronx is credited with creating Hip-Hop in 1973, even though many disagree. Some people say it was created in Queensbridge, Harlem, Bedâ€“Stuy, or Long Island. The South Bronx is well known for its graffiti and break-dancing. The South Bronx is also known for its higher poverty and crime rates, in comparison to the North Bronx. ==References== Category:The Bronx Category:Neighborhoods of New York City",
