 "text": "Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872 - 8 June 1913) was born in Blackheath in southeast London on. She studied at Royal Holloway College and at Oxford University, although women were not allowed to take degrees at that time. In 1906, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), founded by Emmeline Pankhurst. Three years later she gave up her job as a teacher and went to work full-time for the suffragettes. She was frequently arrested for causing a public disturbance and burning post boxes. She spent a number of short periods in jail. In 1909, she was sentenced to a month's hard labour in Strangeways Prison in Manchester after throwing rocks at the carriage of chancellor David Lloyd George. She attempted to starve herself, and resisted force-feeding. A prison guard, angered by Davison's blockading herself in her cell, forced a hose into the room and nearly filled it with water. She sued the wardens of Strangeways, and was awarded 40 shillings. By 1911, Davison was becoming increasingly militant. On 4 June 1913, she ran out in front of the king's horse as it was taking part in the Epsom Derby. Her purpose was unclear, but she was trampled on and died on 8 June – at the age of 40 – from her injuries. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Suffragettes Category:People from London",
