 "text": "Couleur (from French, in English colour, or in American English color) is the word which is used for the headgear and ribbons worn by members of some Central European student societies (Studentenverbindungen). ==Ribbon== The ribbon (so called Band) is worn over the right shoulder to the left hip. Both ends are held together by a button, often made of metal or porcelain. A lot of societies have two types of ribbons. One is used by the new members (so called Fux or Fuchs, after the German for \"fox\"), the other one is used by the elder members (so called Bursche or, if with degree, Alter Herr). The ribbons of the elder members show the original or full colours of the society, where the ribbons of the new members often show a variation of them, such as displaying only two of the three main colours. ==Headgear== ===Cap=== Mostly a cap (so called Mütze) has a black peak, a crown coloured by one of the colours of the ribbon and a band with the colours of the ribbon. ===Tönnchen=== A Tönnchen (German for little Tonne, English little barrel) is a headgear with a flat crown, the top coloured by one of the colours of the ribbon and mostly embroidered with a Zirkel and straight upright sides with the colours of the ribbon. Tönnchen are worn instead of caps by the elder members while inoffcial occasions. ====Straßencerevis==== A Straßencerevis looks like a Tönnchen but it is embroidered with a Zirkel and oak leaves or vine leaves. ==Further reading== * Peter Krause: O alte Burschenherrlichkeit - Die Studenten und ihr Brauchtum, Graz, Wien, Köln 1979 (German), * Peter Krause: O alte Burschenherrlichkeit - Die Studenten und ihr Brauchtum, 5. verb.
