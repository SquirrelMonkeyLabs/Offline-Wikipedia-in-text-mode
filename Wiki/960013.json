He was named Ibrahim, but was soon given the nickname Abai (meaning \"wise\"), which he carried throughout his life for his cleverness. After years of studying at a madrasah under the mullah Ahmed Riza, he attended a Russian school in his youth, partly because of his father's economic status. Abai encountered the works of Mikhail Lermontov and Alexander Pushkin at the Semipalatinsk school. ==References== Category:1845 births Category:1904 deaths",
