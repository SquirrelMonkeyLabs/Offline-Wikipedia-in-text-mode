 "text": "Hurricane Klaus was a weak hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. Klaus moved very close to islands like Antigua and Martinique, while it was a hurricane. The remains of Klaus moved over the Southeastern United States and killed 4 people with Tropical Storm Marco, which was close by. Klaus killed 11 people and cause a little bit more than $1 million in damage. ==Retirement== In the Spring of 1991, France requested that the name Klaus be retired, because of what it did in Martinique. So the National Hurricane Center retired the name Klaus. The name Kyle was used in 1996, 2002, and 2008 instead.
