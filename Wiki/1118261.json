 "text": "Area codes 787 and 939 are area codes for Puerto Rico. Area code 787 was created on March 1, 1996 as a split from 809, which initially served the entire Caribbean Islands. It was overlaid by 939 in 2001, since it was being used up fast due to the increasing demand for phone numbers. When typed on a phone keypad, 787 is memorizable for the mnemonic, PUR, which stands for Puerto Rico. Category:Area codes",
