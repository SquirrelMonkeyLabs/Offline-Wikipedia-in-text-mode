The Greek government considered him a puppet king and tried imprisoned him at his own palace, but then failed. During Alexander's reign, World War 1 ended. Alexander became king after his father, King Constantine XII, was forced to abdicate. Because Alexander's older brother, Crown Prince George, was not yet ready to rule, Alexander became king. During his reign, the king supported Greek troops during their war against the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Under his reign, the territorial extent of Greece considerably increased, following the victory of the Entente and their Allies in the First World War and the early stages of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922. Alexander ruled Greece effectively. He almost ended war that had happened in Greece for a long time. However, on 25 October 1920 in Athens at the age of 27 after being bitten by a Barbary macaque at his palace in Athens. His injury became infected and soon developed sepsis. Because Alexander did not have an heir, an election was held shortly after his death. The election was about return and restoration of Alexander's father, Ex-king Constantine XII, to the throne. Almost 99% of the vote were cast in favour of his return thus Constantine was restored to the throne just two months after Alexander's death. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Deaths from sepsis Category:Kings of Greece",
