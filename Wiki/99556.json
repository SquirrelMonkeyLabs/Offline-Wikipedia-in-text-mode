 "text": "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is a 2006 British-American mockumentary (comedy movie) by English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. The main character, Borat, is a rude, stupid reporter who interviews famous people and ordinary people. The movie was very popular, but also seen as wrong and offensive by some people. This is because it was seen as anti-semitic (against Jews) and racist (against black people). Sacha Baron Cohen says this is wrong and he is Jewish himself. The movie received negative reactions of Kazakh people and the government, whereas the latter banned actor Sacha Baron Cohen from entering to Kazakhstan for his lifetime. == Plot == The plot of the movie is about Borat and his friend going to America from Kazakhstan to make a movie about America. Borat looks very stupid and ignorant in America. Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on television in his hotel. He decides to go to see her while making the movie. He meets many people along the way, interviewing them. == Other websites== * * Category:2006 comedy movies Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:American comedy movies Category:British comedy movies Category:English-language movies Category:Mockumentaries Category:Movies based on TV series Category:Movies set in Asia Category:Movies set in Atlanta Category:Movies set in Alabama Category:Movies set in Kazakhstan Category:Movies set in Texas Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Movies set in New York City Category:Movies set in Washington, D.C.",
