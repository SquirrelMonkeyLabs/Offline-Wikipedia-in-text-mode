 "text": "The Detwiler Fire was a wildfire in Mariposa County, California. The fire burned 81,826 acres, and was one of the worst wildfires in the 2017 California wildfire season. The fire also destroyed 63 homes. The fire was first reported on 16 July 2017 at 3:56 PM PST, and was located near Lake McClure. After 3 hours, the fire already burned 1,000 acres and it spread towards the northeast. On 17 July 2017, the fire grew to 7,100 acres. The intense heat and windy conditions made it hard to contain the fire. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency on 18 July 2017. The Yosemite National Park remained open, but some access roads were closed. On 21 July, the fire was 15% contained but burned through 74,083 acres. By that point, 58 homes were destroyed. In the next few days, the fire department helped control a big portion of the fire. On 26 July, the fire was 65% contained. The fire finally ended on 10 August, after 25 days of burning. The fire was caused by firearms, but no more information was released to the public. == References == Category:2017 California wildfires Category:2017 in weather Category:Mariposa County, California",
