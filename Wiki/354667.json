 "text": "Vase in the Form of a Phallus is an ancient Greek terracotta vase in the form of a flaccid, uncircumcised, penis. The scrotum and pubic hair are depicted. Its overall measurements are 4 ½ in. x 4 in. x 3 ½ in. (11.4 cm. x 10.2 cm. x 8.9 cm.). It dates back to the Archaic period, about 550 BC to 500 BC. Phallic vases are rare in Archaic Greek pottery, and this vase is thought to have held a perfumed oil, used for erotic or medicinal purposes. It is also believed to have been made in Rhodes. The museum writes that the vase displays a playfulness typical of Greek art. == References == * Category:Ancient Greek paintings Category:Ancient Greek pottery Category:6th-century BC works Category:6th century BC in art",
