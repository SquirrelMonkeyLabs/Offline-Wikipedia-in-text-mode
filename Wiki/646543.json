 "text": "A minicomputer is a type of computer that possesses most of the features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size. A minicomputer fills the space between the mainframe and microcomputer, and is smaller than the former but larger than the latter. It also has a computer terminal to operate the computer. Minicomputers are mainly used as small or mid-range servers operating business and scientific applications. However, the use of the term minicomputer has diminished and has merged with servers. A minicomputer may also be called a mid-range computer. ==References== Category:Computers",
