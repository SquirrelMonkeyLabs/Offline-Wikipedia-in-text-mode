The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. The arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Tarn department are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 811 Albi Albi 190,101 2,731.7 169 812 Castres Castres 194,373 3,026.2 151 ==History== Since its creation, the Tarn department has had few changes: * 1790 : creation of the Tarn department with five districts: Albi, Castres, Lavaur, Gaillac, Lacaune; there were two alternating capitals: Albi and Castres * 1800 : creation of the arrondissements: Albi, Castres, Gaillac, Lavaur * 1926 : the arrondissements of Gaillac and Lavaur were eliminated ==References== Tarn",
