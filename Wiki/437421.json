It is for children between one and eight years old. It shows first- run children's television shows, movies and made-for-DVD movies. It follows Playhouse Disney, which aired from February 1, 1999 to September 1, 2013. The name Disney Jr. is also used for a morning and early afternoon program seen on the Disney Channel, branded as \"Disney Jr. on Disney Channel\". ==Programming== Programming on the Disney Jr. channel includes original series and series which used to be shown on the Playhouse Disney block It also showed re-runs of former original shows like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Rolie Polie Olie. There included some that also air on the companion Disney Channel morning block. The network also airs short-form series as well as reruns of some older animated series. These progams had been seen on sister network ABC, CBS (made before 1996) and programs from Disney Channel and Toon Disney. These are aired by the channel by popular demand. ==Blocks== ===Disney Junior Night Light=== Disney Junior Night Light is the former name of Disney Junior channel's overnight programming block, running daily from 9:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The block, which debuted on September 4, 2012, and is sponsored by Babble (under a similar underwriter sponsorship agreement as that regularly used by Disney Channel and Disney Junior, which both operate as commercial- free services), consists of short-form programs intended for co-viewing among parents and their children. Features seen as part of the block include Picture This (which presents sketches of Disney characters being drawn), Sesh Tales (a segment featuring costumed finger puppets with twists on traditional fairy tales) and That's Fresh (a segment featuring cooking tips aimed at parents, presented by celebrity chef Helen Cavallo). Additional series under development at the block's launch included a photography series, a series that follows parents through the day their new baby comes home after being born, and a show about stay-at-home dads. Since 2017, Disney Junior's overnight programming has run unbranded and without the Night Light continuity. As of November 1, 2021, Disney Junior Night Light is still used for interstitials and sign-off due to the handover of Disney Mom.
