 "text": "The International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia was the effort to relocate 22 monuments in Lower Nubia, in Southern Egypt and northern Sudan, between 1960 and 1980. This was done in order to make way for the building of the Aswan Dam, at the Nile's first cataract (shallow rapids), a project launched following the 1952 Egyptian revolution. This project was undertaken under UNESCO leadership and a coalition of fifty countries. This process led to the creation of the World Heritage Convention in 1972, and thus the system of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.The World Heritage Convention: \"The event that aroused particular international concern was the decision to build the Aswan High Dam in Egypt, which would have flooded the valley containing the Abu Simbel temples, a treasure of ancient Egyptian civilization. In 1959, after an appeal from the governments of Egypt and Sudan, UNESCO launched an international safeguarding campaign. Archaeological research in the areas to be flooded was accelerated. Above all, the Abu Simbel and Philae temples were dismantled, moved to dry ground and reassembled. The campaign cost about US$80 million, half of which was donated by some 50 countries, showing the importance of solidarity and nations' shared responsibility in conserving outstanding cultural sites. Its success led to other safeguarding campaigns, such as saving Venice and its Lagoon (Italy) and the Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro (Pakistan), and restoring the Borobodur Temple Compounds (Indonesia). Consequently, UNESCO initiated, with the help of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the preparation of a draft convention on the protection of cultural heritage.\" The construction of the Aswan Dam was a key objective of the new regime the Free Officers movement of 1952 in order to better control flooding, provide increased water storage for irrigation and generate hydroelectricity, all of which were seen as pivotal for the industrialization of Egypt. The building of the dam was to result in the creation of Lake Nasser, which would submerge the banks of the Nile along its entire 479 km (298 mi) length south of the dam – flooding the entire area of historical Lower Nubia. This region was home to 22 critical historical sites, including but not limited to the Abu Simbel temples; as well as the temples at Philae, Kalabsha and Amada. It was described in the UNESCO Courier as \"the greatest archaeological rescue operation of all time\".Victory in Nubia: the greatest archaeological rescue operation of all time In April C.E.1979, the monuments were inscribed on the World Heritage List as the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae, as one of the second group of properties added to the list (the first 12 had been added in 1978). ==World Heritage Site== In April 1979, the monuments were inscribed on the World Heritage List as the \"Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae\". The inscribed area includes ten sites, five of which were relocated (all south of the city of Aswan), and five of which remain in their original position (near to the city of Aswan): Relocated sites, south of the Aswan Low Dam * Abu Simbel * New Amada * New Wadi Sebua * New Kalabsha * Philae temple complex (Agilkia Island) Sites in their original location, north of the Aswan Low Dam – although these five sites are grouped within the \"Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae\", they are neither Nubian, nor between Abu Simbel and Philae * Qubbet el-Hawa (Old and Middle Kingdom Tombs) * Ruins of town of Elephantine * Stone quarries and Unfinished obelisk, Aswan * Monastery of St. Simeon, Aswan * Fatimid Cemetery of Aswan ==Gallery== File:Egyptian Government offer to gift monuments overseas in the 1960 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|Egyptian Government offer to gift monuments overseas in the 1960 UNESCO Courier File:Egyptian and Sudanese declarations in the 1960 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|Egyptian and Sudanese declarations in the 1960 UNESCO Courier File:List of monuments at risk in the 1960 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|List of monuments at risk in the 1960 UNESCO Courier File:List of monuments relocated in the 1980 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|List of monuments relocated in the 1980 UNESCO Courier File:Philae Island in the 1961 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|Philae Island in the 1961 UNESCO Courier File:List of sites excavated in addition to the monuments relocated in the 1980 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|List of sites excavated in addition to the monuments relocated in the 1980 UNESCO Courier File:Abu Simbel in the 1961 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|Abu Simbel in the 1961 UNESCO Courier File:1961 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|1961 UNESCO Courier File:List of Monuments to be Relocated in the 1961 UNESCO Courier - UNESCO documents regarding the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.png|List of Monuments to be Relocated in the 1961 UNESCO Courier ==Bibliography== ===UNESCO publications=== * A Common trust: the preservation of the ancient monuments of Nubia, 1960, UNESCO CUA.60/D.22/A * Save the treasures of Nubia: UNESCO launches a world appeal, 1960, UNESCO Courier * Abu Simbel: now or never, 1961, UNESCO Courier * Nubia's sands reveal their last secrets, 1964, UNESCO Courier * Victory in Nubia: the greatest archaeological rescue operation of all time, 1980, UNESCO Courier * * Success stories, 2019, UNESCO Maria Costanza De Simone \"Remembering the Nubia Campaign.
