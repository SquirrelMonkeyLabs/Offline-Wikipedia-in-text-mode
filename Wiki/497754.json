 "text": "The áº“uhr prayer ( , \"noon prayer\") is the prayer offered at midday. The name Zuhr was given to this prayer because it falls halfway between two daily prayers, those being Fajir (dawn) and Isha (first darkness or night). Practicing Muslims make this prayer daily. It is the second of the five daily prayers (salat). On Friday the Zuhr prayer is replaced by Jumu'ah. It is an obligation for Muslim men but women and children may be excused. The Zuhr prayer, on Friday, is led by a Khutba which is a speech given by the leader of the mosque (Imam). == References == Category:Islamic theology",
