 "text": "Lord Howe Island is a small island about north east of Sydney. It is governed by New South Wales. About 70% of the island is part of the Lord Howe Island Group which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. It is the only place in the world where daylight saving changes the time by 30 minutes, rather than 1 hour. The island was first discovered in 1788 by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, who was captain of the HMS Supply. He was taking convicts from Sydney to start a new prison colony on Norfolk Island. ==References== Category:Geography of New South Wales Category:Islands of Australia Category:Volcanoes of Australia Category:Australian National Heritage List",
