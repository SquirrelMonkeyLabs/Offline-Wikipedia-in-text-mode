 "text": "The Bismarck herring is pickled fresh, filleted Baltic Sea herring, traditionally packed in small wooden barrels. Johann Wiechmann had a store in Stralsund, Germany, and his wife, Karoline, prepared the herring for sale. Wiechmann admired Otto von Bismarck and sent a barrel on Bismarck's birthday. When the German Empire was created, Wiechmann sent Bismarck a second barrel but this time asked to name the herrings after him. Bismarck agreed, and the original recipe of Bismarck herring was sold until the end of World War II. It was revived in 1997 in Stralsund. ==References== Category:Edible fish Category:Dishes named after people Category:German food",
