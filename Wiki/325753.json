There are four nuclear reactors at the plant. All four of them automatically shut down after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The plant is sometimes called Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant because \"Daini\" means \"Number 2\" in Japanese. The plant uses boiling water reactors. Toshiba built reactors 1 and 3. Hitachi built reactors 2 and 4. All reactors at the plant reached cold shutdown by March 15, 2011. In June 2011, 7,000 tons of seawater from the tsunami were still in the plant. TEPCO planned to put it all back into the ocean. But, about 3,000 tons of the water had radioactive chemicals in it. Japan's Fisheries Agency did not let TEPCO release the water back into the ocean.Kyodo News, \"Fishermen to Tepco: Don't release water\", Japan Times, 9 June 2011, p. 1. Japan's Prime Minister said the nuclear emergency at the Fukushima Daini plant was over on December 26, 2011. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Japan Category:Nuclear power plants Category:1982 establishments in Japan Category:2011 disestablishments Category:Fukushima Prefecture",
