 "text": "Bombay bubble-nest frog, Maharashtra bush frog, Castle Rock bush frog, or Konkan bush frog (Raorchestes bombayensis) is a frog. It lives in India. People have seen it 400 to 1300 meters above sea level. This frog lives in trees in tropical forests. It lives on the shorter trees. People have seen it in some forests that have been cut down and are growing back. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because human beings continue to change the places where it lives, especially cutting down forests to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
