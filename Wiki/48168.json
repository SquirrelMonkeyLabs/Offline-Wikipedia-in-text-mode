Bush in his State of the Union speech on January 29, 2002 to describe the governments of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea and later Cuba, Libya, and Syria. He used this term because he believed that they backed terrorism and were trying to buy weapons of mass destruction. The name \"Axis of Resistance\" was later adopted by Iran as a response to the \"Axis of Evil\" name. ==References== Category:Politics of the United States Category:George W. Bush",
