 "text": "The 2008 New Zealand general election was held on 8 November 2008. The liberal-conservative National Party, headed by its parliamentary leader John Key, won the largest share of votes and seats, ending nine years of government by the social-democratic Labour Party, led by Helen Clark. This marked the beginning of the Fifth National Government which governed for the next nine years, until the 2017 general election, when a government was formed between the Labour and New Zealand First parties. The Chief Electoral Officer released the official results on 22 November 2008. ==References== Category:2008 elections Category:21st century in New Zealand Category:New Zealand general elections Category:November 2008 events",
