 "text": "The Thomas theorem is a theory of sociology that was created by William Isaac Thomas and Dorothy Swaine Thomas in 1928. It says: This means that how a situation is seen will cause the future actions, not the actual truth. In Erving Goffman's 1956 sociological book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, he talks a lot about what he calls the definition of the situation, and how it is important that all people see a situation the same. This was based on W. I. Thomas saying, in 1923, that how a person saw situations (\"the definition of the situation\") would later become part of their personality as they would change how they live their life to be similar to other people.The Unadjusted Girl.
