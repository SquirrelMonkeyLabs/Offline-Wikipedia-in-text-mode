He is best known for the 1970 film I Told You So, which came out after Ghana gained independence. == Early Life == Egbert is from Odumase Krobo. He lived in London, UK, for a while and worked at Pinewood Studios. When he returned to Ghana, he worked with the Gold Coast Film Unit starting in 1952. He became one of the first directors when it became the Ghana Film Industry Corporation (GFIC). I Told You So was made with support from GFIC to look at traditional storytelling and the style of concert party theater (Ogunleye, 2014). Egbert also wrote a piece called Hamlet in 1964. Egbert believed that cinema was used as part of a big campaign to get local support for Britain. During World War II, cinema in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) was used to share information and get local people to help Britain with men and supplies for the war.Nanabigne, V. (2001). Cinema in Ghana. History, Ideology and Popular Culture. PhD thesis. Bergen: University of Bergen. With Sam Aryeetey, Tom Ribeiro, and other early filmmakers, Egbert helped start the Ghanaian film industry. == Filmography == * I Told You So == References == Category:Ghanaian movie directors Category:Ghanaian movie producers Category:1931 births Category:Living people",
