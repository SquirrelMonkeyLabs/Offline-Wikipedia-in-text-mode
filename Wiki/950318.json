 "text": "Genital herpes is an infection of the genitals. Most people either have no or mild symptoms, and sometimes they do not know they are infected. Symptoms include blisters that break open to form painful ulcers. Other symptoms are like the flu such as fever, aching, or swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms can be seen as soon as four days after being infected and can last up to four weeks. Once infected further outbreaks may occur but are generally milder. The disease is spread by direct genital contact and mainly happens during sex, including anal and oral sex. The risk of spread between a couple is about 7.5% over a year. There are two types of genital herpes, HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-2 was more common, however genital HSV-1 has become more common in the developed world. ==References== Category:Sexually transmitted diseases Category:Diseases caused by viruses",
