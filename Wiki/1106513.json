The adult male frog is 37 - 44 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 49 - 69 mm long. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. There is only a little webbed skin on the front feet but a lot of webbed skin on the back feet. People see this frog in rivers and forests on mountains. They see this frog between 0 and 1600 meters above sea level. The female frog lays eggs in the water. She lays 200â€“600 eggs at a time. The eggs hatch into tadpoles with large disks on their mouths. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. It has protected parks in it. In some places, the frogs die because people make dams. During the Edo period, people kept these frogs as pets because of their beautiful singing. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
