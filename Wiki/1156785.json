 "text": "Duane syndrome (also called Duane retraction syndrome) refers to a very unusual congenital form of strabismus. People with this condition cannot move their eyes outward. This condition was first described in 1887. It was given its name when Alexander Duane gave more detail about it eighteen years later. The condition is more common for females than males. ==Types of the condition== There are three types of Duane syndrome: *Type I (The eye has trouble moving outward, no problem moving inward) * Type II (The eye has trouble moving inward, none moving outward) * Type III (Eye has trouble moving both inward or outward) Type I is the most common form of Duane syndrome. Other names for this unusual problem include Duane's syndrome and eye retraction syndrome. ==Background== Only 10% of people with Duane syndrome have any family history of it. People of all races are affected by the eye problem. There are usually no other conditions that come with Duane syndrome. ==References== Category:Diseases and disorders of the eye",
