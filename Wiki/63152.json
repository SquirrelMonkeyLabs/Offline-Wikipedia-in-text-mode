 "text": "The Qajar dynasty (Azerbaijani: Qacarlar) (Persian: سلسله قاجار), was an Turkic dynasty that originated from the Qajar tribe. It ruled Iran from 1789 to 1925. They are known for the unification of Iran but were not able to create a powerful centralized state which eventually led to them losing power to the British-backed Cossacks in 1925, and were succeeded by the Pahlavi dynasty. They came to power after a period of instability following the collapse of the Safavid dynasty. == Qajar Shahs of Iran == Name Portrait Title Reign years 1 Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar Shah, Khan 1789–1797 2 Fath-Ali Shah Qajar Shahanshah, Khaqan 1797–1834 3 Mohammad Shah Qajar Shahanshah, Ghazi, Khaqan son of Khaqan 1834–1848 4 Naser al-Din Shah Qajar Shah, Zell'ollah, Qebleh-ye 'ālam, Islampanah 1848–1896 5 Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar Shahanshah, Sultan 1896–1907 6 Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar Shah 1907– 1909 7 Ahmad Shah Qajar Shah 1909–1925 == References == == Sources == * * == Notes == Category:History of Iran Category:Royal dynasties Category:1781 establishments Category:18th-century establishments in Iran Category:1925 disestablishments in Asia Category:1780s establishments in Asia",
