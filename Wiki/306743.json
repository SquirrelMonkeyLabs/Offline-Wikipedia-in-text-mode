 "text": ":See also the Logan Medal of the Geological Association of Canada. The Logan Medal of the Arts was an arts prize started in 1907. Art Institute of Chicago helped to award the prize. From 1917 through 1940, 270 awards were given. The Medal was named for arts patron Frank Granger Logan. Logan founded the brokerage house of Logan & Bryan. He served over 50 years on the board of the Institute. He and his wife, Josephine Hancock Logan, administered the award consistent with their support of the Society for Sanity in Art. They founded that Society in 1936. Josephine Logan also wrote a book in 1937 called Sanity in Art. The Logans strongly opposed all forms of modern art, including cubism, surrealism, and abstract expressionism. == Winners == :This is an incomplete list, please help us by updating it. * 1907: Albin Polasek (first winner)Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago, Volumes 1-12, pg. 263, available online via Google Books * 1918: Walter Ufer * 1921: Frank V.
