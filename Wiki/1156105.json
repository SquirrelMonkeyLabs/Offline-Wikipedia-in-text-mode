 "text": "The brilliant-thighed rocket frog or brilliant-thighed poison arrow frog (Allobates femoralis) is a frog. It lives in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. ==Body== The adult male frog can be 28-33 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog can be 33-35 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is black or dark brown in color. There is a light brown line from the nose to the back legs. There is a white line from the nose to the back legs. There is an orange mark near where the back legs make the body. The belly is white with black marks. The throat is black. This frog eats ants and other animals with no bones. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives on the ground in tropical forests. People have seen it in forests that have never been cut down and forests that were destroyed and are growing back. People see them near the ends of forests. Scientists saw the frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. This frog lives in many protected parks. ==Young== The female frog lays her eggs on the dead leaves on the ground. She lays 8-17 eggs at a time. After the eggs hatch, the male and female frogs carry the tadpoles to water, where the tadpoles swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans do change the places where the frog lives to make farms, make places for animals to eat grass, and get wood to build with. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can get into this frog, but scientists do not think the frogs die from it. Humans do sell this frog on the international pet trade, but scientists do not know if the frogs were caught in the forests or not. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
