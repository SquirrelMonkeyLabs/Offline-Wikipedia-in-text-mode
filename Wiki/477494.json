VG.no. Retrieved March 11, 2022 Badawi has also been banned from any media work or foreign travel for 10 years after his release from prison. Badawi's first 50 lashes were given on January 9, 2015. After that, Badawi's lashes were postponed many times. In June 2015, a Saudi high court ruled that Badawi should be lashed but the lashing was postponed hours before it was going to happen. Badawi's wife called Ensaf Haidar believes he is weak in body and suffering mentally. She fears this may be a slow death sentence. Badawi's sister Samar Badawi is also an activist. Her husband Waleed Abul-Khair is Raif's lawyer. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in July 2014. Samar is working to get both her brother and husband released from prison. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Saudi Arabian writers",
