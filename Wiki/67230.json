 "text": "A lantern is a device that can be moved from one place to another, used to create light and to light up open areas. Lanterns may be used for giving signals, or as general light sources for camping. They can have candles inside, or use other things as fuel, like alcohol or kerosene. Lanterns that give dim light are generally used as decoration. Lanterns are also used in festivals like the Obon festival in Japan. ==Related pages== * Lamp * Candle Category:Lamps Category:Decorations",
