If extra help is needed the BMU can get expert help from * Rat von Sachverständigen für Umweltfragen (SRU), the Committee of Experts on Environmental Questions *Wissenschaftlichen Beirat der Bundesregierung Globale Umweltveränderungen (WBGU), The Scientific Advisory Board on Global Environment Changes * the Reaktorsicherheitskommission (RSK), the Reactor Safety Commission * the Strahlenschutzkommission (SSK),the Radiation Protection Commission * the Störfall-Kommission (SFK), the \"Disruptive Incident\" Commission * the Technischen Ausschuss für Anlagensicherheit (TAA) the Technical Committee on Systems Safety and * the Umweltgutachterausschuss (UGA) Environmental Experts Committee. In 2005 the BMU's budget was 769 million euros. This is about ten percent of the total amount spent on the environment by the federal government. This is because several other ministries also have money to spent on environmental tasks. == History == The ministry was set up on 6 June 1986, about five weeks after the serious reactor disaster at Chernobyl. The Federal Government wanted to bring all responsibility for preventing a disaster in Germany, or clearing up if a disaster happened, under one ministry. The first minister stayed for less than a year, because he became Minister President of Hesse. His successor became director of the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP. The time when Angela Merkel was in charge was not very good for the BMU. Economic problems became more important than environmental protection . The red-green coalition of 1998 saw Jürgen Trittin of (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) become minister. The idea of an environmental tax and ending nuclear power became important. == Ministers == Federal Minister for Environment, Conservation and Reactor Safety Federal Minister for Environment, Conservation and Reactor Safety Federal Minister for Environment, Conservation and Reactor Safety Federal Minister for Environment, Conservation and Reactor Safety Federal Minister for Environment, Conservation and Reactor Safety No Name Term start Term end Party 1 Walter Wallmann (1932-2013) June 6, 1986 April 22, 1987 CDU 2 Klaus Töpfer (1938-2024) May 7, 1987 November 17, 1994 CDU 3 Angela Merkel (1954-) November 17, 1994 October 27, 1998 CDU 4 Jürgen Trittin (1954-) October 27, 1998 October 18, 2005 Bündnis 90/Die Grünen 5 Sigmar Gabriel (1959-) November 22, 2005 October 27, 2009 SPD 6 Norbert Röttgen (1965-) October 28, 2009 May 22, 2012 CDU 7 Peter Altmaier (1965-) May 22, 2012 December 17, 2013 CDU 8 Barbara Hendricks (1952-) December 17, 2013 14 March 2018 SPD 9 Svenja Schulze (1968-) 14 March 2018 8 December 2021 SPD 10 Steffi Lemke (1968-) 8 December 2021 In office Bündnis 90/Die Grünen == Other websites == *Official website *",
