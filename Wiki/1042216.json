 "text": "Jayaram's bush frog (Raorchestes jayarami) is a frog. It lives in India. People have seen this frog between 600 and 1800 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in small pieces of forest in between human villages. They have seen this frog in shola forests. They have seen this frog on tea farms. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it only lives in a few small places and frogs cannot go from one of those places to the others easily. People cut down the forests where the frog lives to get wood to build with and to build farms. Once a year, many people come to this part of the Western Ghats for their religion. The people frighten the frog away, and they burn grassland to make room. Scientists say that climate change could also hurt this frog. Because it lives high in the hills, the frogs cannot move north to colder places. They would have to climb down the hills to warmer places first. Sometimes people catch this frog and use its body to make cough medicine for children. Scientists have seen the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on other frogs in Raorchestes, so they think it could infect R. jayarami too. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
