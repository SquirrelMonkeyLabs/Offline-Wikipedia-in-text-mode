 "text": "Isopods are animals that belong to an order of peracarid crustaceans. This order is called Isopoda. The name Isopoda derives from the Greek roots (iso-, meaning \"same\") and (podos, meaning \"foot\"). Some isopod species live in water, like the tongue louse. Others live on land, like woodlice and pill bugs. == Description == Isopods can be half an inch long. They are usually gray, brown or black, with an oval-shaped body. They have seven armor plates, called \"pereonites,\" which protect them. They also have seven pairs of short legs. Isopods have two pairs of antennae; one pair feels along the ground. Isopods have gills and need water to breathe. Because of this, the isopod species which live on land must stay in moist places. == Related pages == *Cymothoa exigua == Other websites == * *",
