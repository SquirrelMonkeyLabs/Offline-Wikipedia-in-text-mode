(1834). des empereurs du Japon, pp. 1-3; Brown, Delmer M. (1979). Gukanshō, p. 249; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinnō Shōtōki, pp. 84-88. Jimmu is known as the founder of the Imperial dynasty. There are no certain dates for this emperor's life or reign.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 29. The names and sequence of the early emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.Aston, William George. (1896). Nihongi, p. 109 n1. Historians debate whether or not Emperor Jimmu actually existed because there is limited evidence of him. Some stories about him may reflect actual events that happened. == Traditional history == Jimmu is almost certainly a legend.Kelly, Charles F. \"Kofun Culture,\" Japanese Archaeology. April 27, 2009; retrieved 2011-10-19. His name and genealogy are recorded in the Kojiki and Nihonshoki. Jimmu is regarded as a direct descendant of the Shinto sun goddess, Amaterasu. During reign of Emperor Jimmu, the capital of Japan was at Kashiwabara, Yamato at the foot of Mt. Unebi.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1915). The Imperial Family of Japan, p. 1. == Events of Jimmu's life == The absence of information about Jimmu does not mean that he did or did not exist.Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2002). \"Jimmu Tennō,\" Japan encyclopedia, pp. 420-421; excerpt, \"... it is not certain that he actually existed. He was probably a composite ....\" There is very little data about the rulers of Japan before the reign of Emperor BidatsuLouis-Frédéric, \"Traditional order of Tennō\" at pp. 962-963; excerpt, \"dates ... should be treated with caution up to Emperor Bidatsu Tennō, the thirtieth on the list.\" The traditional story is that Jimmu came from Kyushu to Yamato Province on the island of Honshu. The story explains that he followed a three legged crow. He established his reign at Kashihara near Osaka. === After his death === This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Jimmu.Brinkley, Frank. (1915). A History of the Japanese People from the Earliest Times to the end of the Meiji Era, p. 21; excerpt, \"Posthumous names for the earthly Mikados were invented in the reign of Emperor Kammu (782–805) ....\" The actual site of his grave is not known. According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) in Kashihara at Nara. The mausoleum is located a short distance from Kashihara Shrine. === National holiday === In 1872, the Meiji government declared that February 11, 660 BC was the exact date on which the reign of Jimmu began. This was identified as the start of the Japanese nation. This mythical date was commemorated as the holiday Kigensetsu (\"Era Day\"). This national holiday was celebrated from 1872 to 1948.Nussbaum, \"Kigen\" at p. 514. The Kigensetsu events in 1940 were special. They celebrated what was believed to be 2,600 years since the start of Emperor Jimmu's reign.Brownlee, John. Japanese Historians and the National Myths, 1600-1945: The Age of the Gods, pp. 136, 180-185. There has been a similar Japanese national holiday since February 11, 1966. It is called National Foundation Day (Kenkoku Kinen no hi). == Family tree == == Related pages == * Emperor of Japan * List of emperors of Japan * Japanese imperial family tree * Japanese Imperial year == References == == Other websites== Category:Emperors of Japan Category:Japanese mythology",
