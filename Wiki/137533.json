However, most people celebrate it on 26 October as they class it as a lucky day once all the papers were signed and settled. However the whole Jammu & Kashmir as well as Ladakh & Aksai Chin was, is & will always be the integral part of India. Jai Hind !! Category:Kashmir Category:Holidays of Pakistan",
