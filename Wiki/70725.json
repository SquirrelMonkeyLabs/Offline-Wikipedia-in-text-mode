 "text": "Sexual assault is a term from law. It's when a sexual act happens between people, but one or more of the people involved do not consent. In most countries, this is a crime. Sexual assault is a form of sexual violence. There are different forms of sexual assault, including: * Rape, which is forcing someone to have sex who does not give consent. They may not want to do it, or may not be able to give consent. * Child sexual abuse, which involves sexual acts with a child. Children are said to be legally too young to give consent, so sexual acts with children are always considered sexual assault by some areas. * Groping, which is touching people in sexual ways (usually without their consent). * Domestic violence, which can involve sexual violence. * Elder abuse, which involves non-consensual sexual acts with an older person. * Sexual harassment, which is a type of harassment. Often, cases of sexual assault are not reported by victims because of social stigma. In certain countries, there are laws that will punish the victim, for example for \"seducing\" someone. ==Statistics== People who are developmental disabilities are more vulnerable to being sexually abused. As many as 90-99% of people with these disabilities are sexually exploited before the age of 18. A 2010-2011 study in the United States of 1058 people aged 14 to 21 found that 8% had sexually assaulted in their lives. In 66% of cases, no one found out and the perpetrator did not get into any trouble. 50% of perpetrators said that their victim was completely to blame. 2% had raped and 3% had tried to rape. ==References== Category:Sexual abuse Category:Law",
