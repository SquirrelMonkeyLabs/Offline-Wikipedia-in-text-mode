 "text": "Leon N CooperMany printed materials, including the Nobel Prize website, have referred to Cooper as \"Leon Neil Cooper\". However, the middle initial N does not stand for Neil, or for any other name. The correct form of the name is, thus, \"Leon N Cooper\", with no abbreviation dots (February 28, 1930 - October 23, 2024) was an American physicist. He won the Nobel Prize for Physics with John Bardeen and John Robert Schrieffer in 1972. He helped developed the BCS theory of superconductivity. He was also the namesake of the Cooper pair and co-developer of the BCM theory of synaptic plasticity. Cooper died at his home in Providence, Rhode Island, on October 23, 2024, at the age of 94. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2024 deaths Category:American physicists Category:Scientists from New York City",
