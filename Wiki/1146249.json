 "text": "Robotic spacecrafts are unmanned spacecrafts. They can be remotely controlled by humans or fully automated with pre-made instructions to carry out a variety of tasks. Automated spacecrafts are beneficial as they cost less and reduce the amount of risk manned spacecraft would otherwise have. NASA (and many other space agencies) use these for scientific research and measurements, an example being unmanned resupply vessels, satellites and space probes. == References == Category:Spacecraft",
