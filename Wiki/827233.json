 "text": "The Atari CX40 is a single-button joystick. It was the first widely used cross-platform game controller. The original CX10 was released with the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed the Atari 2600) in 1977 and became the primary input device for most games on the platform. The CX10 was replaced after a year by a simpler and less expensive CX40. The addition of the Atari joystick port to other platforms helped it retain its popularity. It was the standard for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers and was compatible with the VIC-20, Commodore 64 and 128, MSX, and later the Atari ST and Amiga. Third-party adapters allowed it to be used on other systems, such as the Apple II and the ZX Spectrum. ==Further reading== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * Category:Joysticks Category:Atari hardware Category:Atari 2600",
