 "text": "The \"Himno de Canarias\" is the anthem of the Canary Islands. ==Lyrics== Spanish original English translation I am the shadow of an almond tree, I am volcano, saltpetre and lava. Distributed in eight rocks The pulse of my soul beats. I am the history and the future, Heart that lights up the dawn Of some islands that awaken Navigating hope. Fighters in nobility Fight the honourable soil Of freedom... This is the beloved land: My Canary Islands. As a single being Together they will dream A rumour of peace Over the wide sea. ==References== Category:Canary Islands Category:Spanish anthems",
