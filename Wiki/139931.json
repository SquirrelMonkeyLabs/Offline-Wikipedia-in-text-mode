The town was renamed after John Grenfell, the Gold Commissioner at Forbes. He had been killed in 1866 when bushrangers attacked a stagecoach on which he was travelling.

The railway reached Grenfell in 1901. The Grenfell area has been badly affected by drought since 2001. ==Events== The poet and story writer Henry Lawson was born on the gold fields at Grenfell.
