 "text": "==For use with music== Editors designed for use with music typically allow the user to do the following: * The ability to import and export various audio file formats for editing * Record audio from one or more inputs and save the recording * Edit the start time, stop time, and duration of any sound on the audio timeline * Fading into/out of or in-between audio clips. * Mix multiple sound sources/tracks, combine them at various volume levels and pan from channel to channel to one or more output tracks * Apply simple or advanced effects or filters, including compression, expansion, flanging, reverb, audio noise reduction, and equalization to change the audio * Playback sound (often after being mixed) that can be sent to one or more outputs, such as speakers, additional processors, or a recording medium * Conversion between different audio file formats, or between different sound quality levels Typically these tasks can be performed in a manner that is non-linear. Each time the edited audio is played back, it is reconstructed from the original source and the specified editing steps. Category:Music software",
