 "text": "The .30 Carbine (pronounced thirty carbine) cartridge is a carbine cartridge first made for the M1 carbine. The U.S. Army made this cartridge because it needed a bullet more powerful than the .45 ACP but lighter than the .30-06. From a rifle, the .30 Carbine has about the same amount of firepower as the .357 Magnum. ==References== Category:7.62 mm firearms Category:Military cartridges Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges",
