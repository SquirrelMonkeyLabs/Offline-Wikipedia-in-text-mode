 "text": "Jean-Luc Raharimanana is a writer from Madagascar. He wrote his first book there but he was unable to publish it because of the political situation. He went to France to study ethnolinguistics at the University of Paris and the Institut National des langues et civilisations orientales. He had graduated from the University of Antananarivo in 1989 with a stipend from the RFI. After completing his studies in France, Raharimanana went on to work as a journalist and French teacher. In his works, Raharimanana often describes the poverty and corruption and the history in his homeland in a violent and lyrical style. Several of his screenplays have been adapted for theatre. He is the subject of the 2004 documentary Gouttes d’encre sur l’île rouge. Raharimanana's works have been translated into German, English, Italian, and Spanish. Raharimanana currently lives in Paris.
