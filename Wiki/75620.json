 "text": "The Kaaba is a large cuboid-shaped Building inside al-Masjid al-Haram (Islam's holiest mosque) in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The Kaaba is the holiest place in Islam. Muslims believe that the Kaaba is the House of God (Allah), built at Allah's command. The Kaaba’s original architecture has remained the same for centuries. == History == === Before Prophet Muhammad === According to Islamic sources, the Kaaba was a place of worship for angels before the creation of man. After Adam was created, he built the Kaaba. According to the Qur'an, it was the first house on Earth.Seyyed Ḥusain Naṣr, Islamic Art And Spirituality (Albany: State Univ. of New York Pr., 1987),43Quran 3/96 The Kaaba was buried under the sand by Noah's flood. After a period of time, it was rebuilt by Prophet Abraham and his son, Prophet Ishmael.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia (Peru: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2006), 1008John L Esposito, The Oxford History Of Islam (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2000), 78Andrew Petersen, Dictionary Of Islamic Architecture (London: Routledge, 1999), 142Quran 22/26 The Kaaba was a place of monotheism for centuries. Then Amr bin Luhayy brought an idol to the Kaaba.E. van Donzel, Bernard Lewis and Ch. Pellat, The Encyclopaedia Of Islam (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 91, 318. After that, the Kaaba became a place of pagan belief.Inside Mecca, directed by Anisa Mehdi, (National Geographic, 2003) === After Prophet Muhammad === Muslims began to manage the Kaaba in 630 AD. Idols are forbidden in Islam, and Prophet Muhammad removed them. Under Muhammad's guidance, the Kaaba was cleaned with sacred water. Because people wanted to keep the Kaaba's original architecture, it remained the same for a thousand years. Only simple repairs and small decorations were done during this period. However, in 1630, three walls of the Kaaba were heavily damaged by a storm. The Kaaba was then restored by Murad IV, the seventeenth Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Following this renovation, the Kaaba has remained the same. == Religious significance == The Kaaba is the holiest place in Islam. Muslims believe that Allah commanded man to build it. Prophet Mohammed called Masjid al-Haram (\"the Sacred Mosque\") one of the three most important mosques on the Earth.Sunan an-Nasa'i 2898Sahih Muslim 1397 Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage (hajj) once in a lifetime to the Kaaba. Because it is the holiest place in Islam, all Muslims pray towards the Kaaba. At the end of Hajj season, there is a holiday called Eid al-Adha (English: Festival of Sacrifice). == Appearance == === Architecture === The Kaaba is a rectangular building made of blue-gray granite. It is 12 meters long, 10 meters wide, and 15 meters high (33 feet x 50 feet x 45 feet).Richard Ettinghausen, Oleg Grabar and Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Islamic Art And Architecture, 650-1250 (New Haven (Conn.): Yale University Press, 2001), 3. Three pillars (columns) inside the Kaaba support the roof. The floor is made of marble, while the ceiling is covered with cloth. Gold and glass decorations hang between the pillars.Issa 3d,”Inside Kaaba 3d,” (Kaaba- first time the 360), accessed November 4, 2018, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oviQ-L9Kv9Q # The Black Stone is an egg-shaped black stone with red and yellow marks. # The door is 2.13 m above the ground and made of pure gold.
