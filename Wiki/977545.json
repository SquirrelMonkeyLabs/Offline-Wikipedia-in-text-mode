 "text": "The Chudasama is an abhir clan found in the state of Gujarat in India. Indian archaeologist and scholar, Bhagwan Lal Indraji held that the Chudasamas were originally Rajputs as their traditions attest connexion with the description of Graharipu, one of their kings by Hemachandra in his Dvyashraya Kavya points to his being of some local tribe of ancient Abhirs. Further in their bardic traditions as well as in popular stories the Chudasamas are still commonly called as Abhir-Ranas. The position of Aberia in Ptolemy (A.D. 150) seems to show that in the second century they settled between Sindh and the Punjab. Ra Graharipu of Junagarh who fought Mularaja Solanki in A.D 961 was later identified as a Chudasama. ==Origin== The Chudasama dynasty, originally of Rajput clan from Sind wielded great influence around Junagadh from the 875 A.D. onwards when they consolidated themselves at Vanthali (ancient Vamanasthali) close to Girnar under their - King Ra Chuda. They began to rule in Southern and western Sourashtra from the second half of the 10th century A.D their capital was vamanshtali, modern vanthali nine miles west of Junagadh. They became very powerful during the reign of Graharipu who defeated the Saindhavas and the Chaulukyas. A Chudasama prince styled Graharipu and ruling at Vanthali near Junagadh is described in the Dyashraya-Kavya of Hemachandra as a Rajput. ==References== Category:Social groups Category:Gujarat __NOTOC__ __STATICREDIRECT__ __NOEDITSECTION__",
