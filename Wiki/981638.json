 "text": "The Battle of Alesia (September 52 BC) was a battle between the Gauls and the Romans, led by Julius Caesar. It was the last major battle between the Gauls and the Romans. The Romans surrounded the Gauls, and built another fortification around the Gauls' fortification, trapping them in. The Gauls tried to attack from the inside and outside, but the Romans cavalry helped sustain the fort. In one night, the Gauls tried a surprise attack, but Caesar eventually won. This victory was one of Caesar's most impressive victories. Category:Wars and battles of Ancient Rome Category:52 BC",
