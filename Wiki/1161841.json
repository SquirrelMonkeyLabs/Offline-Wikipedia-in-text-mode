At his school, there is a moldy piece of cheese on the blacktop. A kid named Darren Walsh touched it and started what is called the \"cheese touch\". If you touch someone with the cheese touch, you are stuck with it until you pass it onto someone else. The only way to not get the cheese touch is to cross your fingers.
