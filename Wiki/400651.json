 "text": "The Division of Fremantle is an Australian Electoral Division in Western Australia. It was one of the original 75 divisions for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the city of Fremantle, which in turn is named for Captain Charles Fremantle. Fremantle was captain of HMS Challenger, which brought the first settlers to Western Australia. The Division includes the southern suburbs of Perth, Cockburn, Coolbellup, Palmyra, Fremantle and Rottnest Island. The division originally included Perth's southwestern suburbs. Boundary changes since 1949 have made it a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party. ==Members== Member Party Term Elias Solomon Free Trade 1901–1903 William Carpenter Labor 1903–1906 William Hedges Western Australian 1906–1909 Commonwealth Liberal 1909–1913 Reginald Burchell Labor 1913–1916 National Labor 1916–1917 Nationalist 1917–1922 William Watson Independent 1922–1928 John Curtin Labor 1928–1931 William Watson United Australia 1931–1934 John Curtin Labor 1934–1945 Kim Beazley (senior) Labor 1945–1977 John Dawkins Labor 1977–1994 Carmen Lawrence Labor 1994–2007 Melissa Parke Labor 2007–present Many senior Labor members have held Fremantle.
