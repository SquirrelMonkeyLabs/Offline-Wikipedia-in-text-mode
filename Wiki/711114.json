 "text": "Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives (called either delegates or resident commissioner, in the case of Puerto Rico) are representatives of their territory in the House of Representatives, but they can't vote on legislation in the full House. However, they are able to take part in certain other House activities. Non-voting members may vote in a House committee they are a member in, and they can introduce legislation. There are currently six non-voting members: a delegate representing the federal district of Washington D.C., a resident commissioner representing Puerto Rico, and one delegate for each of the other four US Territories with people: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. A seventh delegate, representing the Cherokee Nation, has been formally proposed but not yet seated. Non-voting delegates are elected every two years. The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico is elected every four years. ==Current non-voting members== District Title Incumbent Party House Caucus Affiliation First elected Constituency map American Samoa at-large Delegate Amata Coleman Radewagen Republican Republican 2014 District of Columbia at-large Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton Democratic Democratic 1990 Guam at-large Delegate James Moylan Republican Republican 2022 Northern Mariana Islands at-large Delegate Gregorio Sablan Independent Democratic 2008 Puerto Rico at-large Resident Commissioner Jenniffer González-Colón New Progressive Republican 2016 U.S. Virgin Islands at-large Delegate Stacey Plaskett Democratic Democratic 2014 ==References== ==Other websites== * History and powers of DC's Delegate to Congress Category:United States House of Representatives",
