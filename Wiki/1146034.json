 "text": "Pierre Cardin SA is a French luxury brand started by designer Pierre Cardin in 1950. It began as a fashion house, expanding into perfumes and cosmetics in the 1960s. By 1988, the brand was licensed for a wide range of products, which some say affected its image. Pierre Cardin products are made by Ahlers Group in Herford, Germany. In 2011, Cardin wanted to sell the brand, valuing it at â‚¬1 billion, but ultimately did not find a buyer. == References == Category:Fashion",
