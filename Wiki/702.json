Tuscarora English Dictionary Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999 Mohawk: Kaniatarowanenneh, meaning \"big waterway\") is a big river in eastern North America. It flows between the Canadian province of Quebec & Ontario and the American state of New York, and through the major Canadian city of Montreal. It is the third largest river in Canada. The river drains water from the Great Lakes into the Atlantic Ocean. It is more than three thousand kilometres long. The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big \"estuary\" or bay, the biggest in the world; this is called the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The Canadian cities of Kingston, Montreal, Trois-Rivières and Quebec City are on this river. The Saint Lawrence Seaway allows ships to go up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America. ==References== ==Other websites== * Regional Geography of the St. Lawrence River * Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System * Safe Passage: Aids to Navigation on the St. Lawrence - Historical essay, illustrated with drawings and photographs * Annotated Bibliography on St. Lawrence County and Northern New York region. * International Saint Lawrence River Board of Control * Saint Lawrence River from The Canadian Encyclopedia * Watch the Jacques Cousteau documentary, St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea * The Steamboats \"Sir James Kemp\" and \"Lord Dalhousie\" on the River St. Lawrence, Upper Canada in 1833 by D.J.
