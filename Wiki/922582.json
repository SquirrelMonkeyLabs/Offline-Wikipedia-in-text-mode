At least 306 people have been reported dead, and several thousand homes were damaged or destroyed. It is the deadliest storm in South African history, one of the deadliest natural disasters in the country in the 21st century, and the deadliest storm since the 2019 Durban Easter floods. ==References== Category:2022 disasters in Africa Category:2022 floods Category:April 2022 events Floods",
