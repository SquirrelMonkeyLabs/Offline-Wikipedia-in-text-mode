 "text": "The New World Order (also known as just nWo) is a professional wrestling stable that is best known for competing in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E). The stable was created on July 7, 1996 and broke up on July 15, 2002. nWo had a gimmick of a group of unsanctioned wrestlers trying to \"take over\" WCW. The nWo angle was based on Universal Wrestling Federation's invasion of New Japan Pro Wrestling. A well known moment happened at Bash at the Beach when Hulk Hogan unexpectedly turned heel for the first time in nearly fifteen years. The nWo angle is one of the most popular and successful angles in modern-day professional wrestling. ==List of incarnations and members== ===WCW=== Incarnation: Notes: Members: Tenure: nWo Original incarnation (Heels) * Scott Hall (he was a founding member, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Kevin Nash (he was a founding member, he was the leader of nWo Wolfpac after split) * Hollywood Hogan (he was the leader and was a founding member, he was the leader of nWo Hollywood after split) * Ted DiBiase (he joined in August 1996, he left in April 1997) * The Giant (he joined in September 1996, he was kicked out of the group in December 1996) * nWo Sting (he joined in September 1996, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Syxx (he joined in September 1996, he was fired from WCW in March 1998) * Vincent (he joined in September 1996, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Nick Patrick (he joined in August 1996, he was kicked out of the group in April 1997) * Miss Elizabeth (she joined in September 1996, she sided with nWo Wolfpac after split) * Eric Bischoff (he joined in November 1996, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Buff Bagwell (he joined in November 1996, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Michael Wallstreet (he joined in December 1996, he was contractually removed from group in April 1997) * Big Bubba Rogers (he joined in December 1996, he was contractually removed from group in April 1997) * Scott Norton (he joined in December 1996, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Masahiro Chono (he joined in December 1996) * Randy Savage (he joined in February 1997, he sided with nWo Wolfpac after split) * Dennis Rodman (he joined in March 1997, he left the group in July 1997) * The Great Muta (he joined in May 1997) * Tenzan (he joined in May 1997) * Konnan (he joined in July 1997, he sided with nWo Wolfpac after split) * Curt Hennig (he joined in September 1997, he sided with nWo Wolfpac after split) * Rick Rude (he joined in November 1997, he sided with nWo Wolfpac after split) * Louie Spicolli (he joined in January 1998, he died on February 15, 1998) * Dusty Rhodes (he joined in January 1998, he sided with nWo Wolfpac after split) * Brian Adams (he joined in February 1998, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * The Disciple (he joined in February 1998, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) * Scott Steiner (he joined in February 1998, he sided with nWo Hollywood after split) July 7, 1996 -
