The first Formula One race was held in 14 August 1958. The first three F1 races were held in both Boavista and Monsanto. 1960 was the last Formula One race for more than 20 years. The Portuguese Grand Prix returned to the calendar in 1984 to the Autódromo do Estoril in 1984. After the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, the Estoril track was changed. A new chicane was built in place of the tank curve, as a safety measure. But Estoril was considered an unsafe and outdated track. The last Portuguese Grand Prix was in Estoril on 22 September 1996. ==Broadcasting== ===United Kingdom=== Year Network Lap-by-lap Colour commentator(s) BBC Two Murray Walker Jonathan Palmer Eurosport Ben Edwards John Watson BBC Two Murray Walker Jonathan Palmer Eurosport Ben Edwards John Watson BBC Two Murray Walker Jonathan Palmer Eurosport Allard Kalff John Watson BBC One Murray Walker Jonathan Palmer Eurosport Allard Kalff John Watson BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt Eurosport Allard Kalff John Watson BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt Eurosport Richard Nicholls John Watson BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt Eurosport Richard Nicholls John Watson BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt BBC Two Murray Walker James Hunt == References == Category:Formula One Grands Prix",
