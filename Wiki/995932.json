 "text": "Kenju burai-chō Nukiuchino Ryu also known as Ryuji the Gun Slinger, is a 1960 Japanese crime action film directed by Haruyasu Noguchi and produced by Nikkatsu. It stars Keiichiro Akagi as the lead main character. It was the first installment of the Tale of The Gunman series. At the time of the film's release, another movie to be screened at the same time was \"Keiji monogatari: Koroshi o agero\", directed by Isamu Kosugi and starring Kyōji Aoyama. == Plot == Ryūji Kenzaki, a gunman who has the nickname \"Piercing Dragon\", hates killing. He finishes his task by shooting the opponent's shoulder on the dominant hand side to make it impossible to recover, so he is called \"The Killer Who Dosent Kill\" and was feared by many around him. One night, he receives a request to shoot a gang leader, but he cannot pull out his gun due to withdrawal symptoms from drug addiction and is in a crisis. A killer known as \"Colt Silver\" appears and saves Ryuji. Yang Sanyuan, a Chinese businessman from Hong Kong who hires Gin as a bouncer, takes Ryuji to the hospital for treatment, pays the expenses, and takes care of his life, such as giving him home after he is discharged from the hospital. Ryuji, who was going to wash his feet, becomes Yang's bodyguard out of obligation. He reunites with his best friend, former boxer Keikichi, in the room of Fusae, a boutique owner who lives in the same apartment. Keikichi became addicted to drugs and gave up boxing after getting involved in match-fixing because of his drug addiction. While working in restaurants, boutiques, and nightclubs, Yang made money by smuggling drugs in partnership with the Hotta Gang who ran a boxing gym. Since the group is under investigation by the Tokyo police, Yang is about to cut ties with the gang. Hotta Gang crime boss Juzaburo Hotta secretly summons Ryuji and asks him to release information on a big deal that will be carried out without the gang, but he avoids answering on the spot. One night, members of the Hotta Gang attacked the Yang's men just after the deal was broken off. Colt Silver killed the Hotta's Gang members. On the way back, the police appeared and persistently interrogated Yang's close aide and restaurant owner, Zhāng, who was in charge of the transaction. Zhang uses gardening sands he has in his pocket to escape the situation. Yang discovers an informant among the crew and orders the traitor to be found and eliminated. He also asks Ryuji and Colt to kill Hotta who had attacked his men when the partnership breaks off. Instead of complying, Ryuji demands that Fusae and Keikichi, tied up with Yang's drugs, be set free. Ryuji, who doesn't want to kill people, persuades Hotta to reconcile with Yang, but Gin reluctantly shoots him dead in the middle of it with his mistress, which leads Ryuji to punch Gin away. Yang sees Midori, the nightclub hostess, as a clue leading to the informant and tries to kidnap her to the office. Ryuji, who happened to be an acquaintance of Midori, lied, saying, \"That's my sake. It has nothing to do with me.\" Before long, Midori's older brother, Ishii, a nightclub trumpet player, appears in front of Ryuji. Ishii was the one who passed the information on Yang Gang to the Hotta group and the Tokyo Police and revealed his identity as an undercover narcotics investigator working for the police on an illegal drug smuggling investigation. Knowing that Ryuji is saddened by Keikichi's drug addiction, Ishii asks Ryuji for help destroying the gang and stopping them from selling drugs to the American mafia who wanted to meet with Yang's crew at Yokohama. Yang decides that Fusae is the informant and tortures her, but Gin, who doesn't like Yang's methods of sadistic torture and cruelty, finds a chance and releases her. Keikichi, who is in the hospital, is also attacked by Yang's minions, but he fights off with punches, and Midori hides him while he is escaping. Ishii's identity is discovered by the Yang Gang, and he disappears. Yang decides that Ryuji hired Ishii and orders Zhang to eliminate Ryuji. Ryuji, who had killed Zhang, was angry at Yang's tyranny and rushed to the port trade site where Yang himself was participating to defeat him. Gin stands in front of Ryuji before he shoots through Gin's right shoulder. After that, Yang shoots Gin out of the shadows, fatally injuring him. Ryuji yells \"Idiot\" and beats Yang. Before he died, the dying Gin praises Ryuji and said in his final words, \"If your fist was Hajiki when you killed Hotta, I would have died. But for you, you are the real pistol user.\" Ishii appears there along with the entire police and arrests Ryuji along with Yang and the rest of the drug traders. Midori, who followed him, says, \"I'll be waiting forever,\" as she sees him taken away by the authorities. == Cast == * Keiichirō Akagi as Ryuji Kenzaki * Ruriko Asaoka as Midori Ishii * Joe Shishido as Colt Silver (also named Gin) * Minako Katsuki as Fusae Maki (fashion designer and Keikichi's lover) * Tadao Sawamoto as Keikichi Mishima (ex-boxer and Ryuji's best friend) * Ichiro Sugai as Goro Shizu (Doctor) * Kō Nishimura as Yang Sanyuan (Chinese businessman and leader of the Yang Crew) * Arihiro Fujimura as Zhang (Restaurant owner and Yang's close aide) * Hiroshi Nihon'yanagi as Juzaburo Hotta (Crime boss of the Hotta Group) * Kōjirō Kusanagi as Goro Ishii (Midori's older brother) * Shirō Amakusa as Baba (Hotta Group member) * Toshinosuke Nagao as Shoda (Narcotics Enforcement officer) * Hiroshi Cho as Zhu (Yang's aide) * Kaku Takashina as Minamoto Ryōba (Hotta Group member) * Setsuko Amamiya as Takada (nurse) * Go Kuroda as Bǎo (Yang's aide) * Norikatsu Hanamura as Detective Yoshimura (credited as Akinori Hanamura) * Junichi Yamanobe as Noboru Miyaji (Miyaji Group leader and Ryuji's target) * Ikunosuke Koizumi as Kobe (Narcotics Enforcement officer) * Kazuo Kinugasa as Boxing gym trainer (credited as Masuo Kinugasa) * Kenzo Kawabe as Mita (Miyaji Group's underboss and Ryuji's target) * Shuji Hayami, Kensuke Tamai, Masaaki Honme as Hotta Group members * Arata Shibata as Dynamite delivery truck driver (credited as Shinzo Shibata) * Masuyo Suzumura as Orphanage nursery school teacher * Hiromi Kuroki as Doll shop clerk * Taeko Yanagida as Hotta's lover * Rinko Saito as Hotta Group member's wife (whose lover is a boxing gym manager) * Koshiro Abe as a Boxing trainee * Sachiko Nishida as Nightclub singer (non- credited) * Alexander Scourby as William (American mafia buyer) (non-credited) * Michael Dante as William's bodyguard (non-credited) == Staff == * Director: Haruyasu Noguchi * Planner: Kenzo Asada * Original story: Rei Kido (all read, published Tokyo Bungeisha edition) * Writer: Iwao Yamazaki * Cinematographer: Kazuei Nagatsuka * Music Composer: Naozumi Yamamoto * Editior: Masanori Tsujii * Sound Recordist: Nobuo Fukushima * Assistant Director: Takashi Miyano * Theme Song: Town of Black Mist (黒い霧の街, Kuroi kiri no machi), Lyrics: Kaoru Mizuki, Composer: Hideyuki Fujiwara, Performer: Keiichirō Akagi * Insert Song: One-on-One Blues (一対一のブルース, Ichitaiichi no burūsu), Lyrics: Takashi Umemoto, Composer: Hiroshi Mochizuki, Performer: Sachiko Nishida * Action Choreography: Masatoshi Takase Category:1960 crime movies Category:Japanese crime movies Category:Japanese action movies",
