 "text": "The Northern Dvina (, ; ) is a river in northern Russia. It goes through Vologda Oblast and Arkhangelsk Oblast. It goes into the Dvina Bay of the White Sea. Most of the water from Northwest Russia goes into the Arctic Ocean from the Northern Dvina River and the Pechora River. ==Etymology== The name of the river comes from the Western Dvina. In the Komi language, the river is called Вы́нва / Výnva. This word comes from vyn \"power\" and va \"water, river\". This makes the name \"powerful river\". ==Navigation and canals== The river is used for timber rafting in the summer. The Northern Dvina Canal connects the Volga–Baltic Waterway and the Northern Dvina river. In the 1800s, the Northern Ekaterininsky Canal was made. This canal is now abandoned. In 1926–1928 a canal was used. This canal is not used. The river used to have lots of commercial passenger ships. Now, there are only local passenger ships. ==References== ==Other websites== * * *A detailed article about Northern Dvina in the 1906 Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary Category:Rivers of Russia Category:Vologda Oblast Category:Arkhangelsk Oblast",
