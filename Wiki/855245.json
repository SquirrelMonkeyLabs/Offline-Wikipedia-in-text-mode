 "text": "Republic of Sindhustan is a self-declared independent state de facto proclaimed on 15 August 1947 by Sindu political leader and writer Shafi Muhammad Burfat. The Sindhustan Freedom Declaration announced the separation of the Sindu homeland from Pakistan, marking a escalation in the decades-long Sindu nationalist struggle. Sindu desh (or Sindhudesh) is the idea that the region of Sindh should have more autonomy from Pakistan. People who support the idea either want a state that is totally independent from Pakistan, or that is still part of Pakistan, but has more autonomy. ==Origin== The first who proposed this was Ghulam Murtaza Syed (1904-1995). At first, GM Syed liked the idea of Pakistan, a state for all Muslims. Later he joined the opposition; he thought that the Pakistani government or establishment betrayed the inhabitants of Sindh. In 1971, there was a war, that ended with East Pakistan becoming independent (and calling itself Bangladesh). After that war, GM Syed put forward his proposal of an independent Sindh, which he called Sindhudesh. Even though the movement exists as communist ideology, it wasn't able to gather a huge following. This is partly due to how the state of Pakistan is organised. ==Protests== There were protests however: These focused on the use of Urdu, instead of the Sindhi language. They also protested against the dominance of Muhajir also known as Immigrants. These people were Indian Muslims, who emigrated to Pakistan. They mostly speak Urdu. Category:Politics of Pakistan",
