 "text": "The New York Giants are an American football team. They are a part of the National Football League (NFL). Even though they are called the New York Giants, they do not play in New York. They play in East Rutherford, New Jersey. New York is right across the Hudson river from East Rutherford, so they consider New York as home. The Giants play in MetLife Stadium, which they share with the New York Jets. ==History== The New York Giants started playing in 1925. They were named for the baseball team, which is also called the New York Giants. They have won six NFL championships, including two before the Super Bowl era. On February 3, 2008, the Giants beat the previously unbeaten New England Patriots (17-14) to win their third Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl XLII as well as stopping them from achieving the NFL's first perfect season since the Miami Dolphins in 1972. The previous two Super Bowl victories came against the Denver Broncos and the Buffalo Bills (when they won the game on a missed last second field goal that went \"wide right\".) The Giants won Super Bowl XLVI against the Patriots but this time the Patriots went 13-3 in the regular season. The Giants beat them in Foxborough during the 2011 season. They are currently one of the worst teams in the NFL, winning only three games and losing fourteen as of the 2024 NFL Season. ==Other websites== * Official site Category:1925 establishments in the United States Category:1920s establishments in New York (state) Category:1920s establishments in New Jersey",
