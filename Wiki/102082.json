 "text": "Gandhi is a rock band from Costa Rica. They play music using distorted guitars and rhythm. The band members are Abel Guier (bassist), Massimo Hernández (drummer), Federico Miranda (guitarist) and Luis Montalbert-Smith (singer and pianist). The lyrics of Gandhi songs are written mainly by Montalbert-Smith. Some of the bands that influenced their songs are Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Queen and Soda Stereo. Montalbert-Smith is a very important part of the band's performances because of his charisma and stage presence. These characteristics makes the shows very interesting and full of adrenaline for their fans. The band began when Miranda and Montalbert-Smith met in high school in the mid 1990s. The complete group of four members started playing at universities and local bars. One of the things that made their shows so well liked was the many different types of art offered. The fans could not only listen to the music, but also see very good scenery design, body painting and their performance. The band won the Costa Rican award \"Album of the Year\" in 2004 for the album Ciclos. The album “Páginas Pérdidas” got three local awards in 2000. They have played in Costa Rica but also in Central America, Mexico and the United States. The band was chosen to be part of the Tribute to Soda Stereo (Tributo a Soda Stereo). They played a version of \"En el sétimo día\" (\"In the Seventh Day\"). They have opened concerts for many international artists. ==Albums== *1997: En el jardín del corazón (In the Garden of the Heart) *2000: Páginas perdidas (Lost Pages) *2002: BIOS *2004: Ciclos (Cycles) *2006: Un ciclo más (One Cycle More) - double DVD *2009: Arigato NO! ==Music videos== They have some videos of their songs: Year Song Translation Album 2000 \"El invisible\" \"The Invisible \"Páginas Pérdidas'' 2000 \"Mátame\" \"Kill me \"Páginas Pérdidas'' 2002 \"Comida de animal\" \"Animal Food\" Bios 2002 \"Procesión\" \"Procession\" Bios 2002 \"Hacia adentro\" \"To the Inside\" Bios 2004 \"Una ilusión\" \"An Illusion\" Ciclos 2004 \"Sr. Caballero\" \"Mr. Gentleman\" Ciclos 2004 \"Sombras\" \"Shadows\" Ciclos 2004 \"Ciclos\" \"Cycles\" Ciclos 2006 \"Mientras Tanto\" \"Meanwhile\" Un ciclo más ==Other websites== *Official site Category:Rock bands Category:San José, Costa Rica Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in North America Category:20th-century establishments in Costa Rica",
