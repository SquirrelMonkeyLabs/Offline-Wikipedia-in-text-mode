 "text": "Blaxploitation is a type of exploitation movie which focuses on black people. Blaxploitation movies emerged in and were most popular during the early 1970s. These movies were often criticized for their use of stereotyped characters. They were also praised for showing black people as the heroes and main subjects, rather than being sidekicks or as victims of violence. Following the example set by Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, many blaxploitation films feature funk and soul jazz soundtracks with heavy bass, funky beats, and wah- wah guitars. == References == Category:Exploitation movies Category:Mockbuster movies Category:Movie genres Category:African-American history",
