 "text": "The British Longhair is a breed of cat. It originated in Great Britain. == History == British Longhair was created by crossing between British Shorthair and Persian cat. It has not been bred as an independent breed. Since many British Shorthair cats carry the mutation for longhair, it happened again and again that from two British Shorthair cats also longhair were born. These were the starting for the breeding of the British Longhair. Embedded Flash presentation. == Health == British Longhairs are prone to obesity if they are neutered or kept as an indoor-only cat. Like most long-haired cats, they need to be brushed. In the fall and winter, the coat tangles easily because of the thicker integument. They are at risk for hereditary polycystic kidney disease (PKD), especially autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). == References == == Other websites == * Be a British Cat * Standard LOOF * Standard TICA * Standard WCF Category:Cat breeds",
