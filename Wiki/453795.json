 "text": "The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 and was the British legislature from 1707 until 1801. Members of parliament from all of Great Britain met in the House of Commons. Lords Temporal from Great Britain met in the House of Lords. During the 18th century, bishops from the Church of England (the state religion of England and Wales) also met in the House of Lords. (There are no bishops in the Church of Scotland.) The parliament came into existence because the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland ratified the Treaty of Union. Both parliaments made legislation (the Acts of Union 1707) to make a new unitary state with anew legislature.Karin Bowie, Scottish Public Opinion and the Anglo-Scottish Union, 1699-1707 (London: Royal Historical Society, 2007), p. 4 These acts of parliament created a new United Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved (or ended) the separate English and Scottish parliaments.Lawrence Stone, An Imperial State at War: Britain from 1689 to 1815 (London: New York: Routledge, 2003). p. 224 The British parliament met in the old home of the Parliament of England, in the old Palace of Westminster, in the City of Westminster near the City of London. This parliament lasted nearly a century, until the Act of Union 1800 merged the separate Parliament of Great Britain and the Irish Parliament into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom. It became effective 1 January 1801, the same date the kingdom of Ireland joined with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. == References == Category:Politics of the United Kingdom Category:1707 establishments Category:18th-century establishments in Great Britain Category:1801 disestablishments Category:19th-century disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:1800s disestablishments in Europe Category:1700s establishments in Europe",
