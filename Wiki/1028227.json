 "text": "The 2021 Western Australian state election was held on 13 March 2021 to elect the 41st Parliament of Western Australia, including all 59 seats in the Legislative Assembly and all 36 seats in the Legislative Council. It was conducted by the Western Australian Electoral Commission (WAEC). The incumbent Labor government, led by Premier Mark McGowan, was re-elected in a landslide. They were opposed by the Liberal Party, led by Zak Kirkup, and the National Party, led by Mia Davies. The Liberals lost all but two seats, while the Nationals won four, making the Nationals the official Opposition. After the election, the two parties formed an alliance, called the Western Australian Opposition Alliance, similar to the Coalition, with the Nationals as the senior partner and the Liberals as the junior partner. Labor won the largest majority government (89.8% of seats) and the largest two-party-preferred vote (69.7%) ever won by any party at any election in Australian history. For the first time, they had a majority in both chambers of Parliament. ==References== Category:2021 elections Category:Elections in Western Australia",
