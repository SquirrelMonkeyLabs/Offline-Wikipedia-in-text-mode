 "text": "Eyre Peninsula is a triangle shaped peninsula in South Australia. On the east is Spencer Gulf, and on the west is the Great Australian Bight. Its north boundary is the Gawler Ranges. It is named after explorer Edward John Eyre who explored some of it in 1839-1841. The coastline was first explored by Matthew Flinders in 1801-1802. The west coast was also visited by Nicolas Baudin at around the same time. == Overview == The peninsula was explored by John Charles Darke in 1844, who was killed by local Aborigines on his return to Port Lincoln. The main towns are Port Lincoln on the southern point, Whyalla and Port Augusta at the north east, and Ceduna at the northwest. They are joined by the Eyre Highway across the inland edge, and the Flinders Highway and Lincoln Highway along the west and east coasts. The major industry is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the dry north area. More water- intensive farming such as dairy farming and growing wine industry happen in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing. Port Lincoln had a large tuna fishing fleet, which is now changing to fish farming in bays along the coast. The Eyre Peninsula has a growing population of around 55,390 people. There is a commercial nephrite jade mine near Cowell. Iron ore is mined in the hills near Iron Knob and taken by rail to Whyalla for smelting. National Parks located on the Eyre Peninsula include Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park, Gawler Ranges National Park, and several conservation parks and reserves like Acraman Creek Conservation Park. In January 2005, bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula killed nine people. == Transport == The peninsular is served by the isolated narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway. ==References== ==Other websites== *Terraserver.com navigable satellite map of the Eyre Peninsula. *SouthAustralia.com Eyre Peninsula - Travel Guides, Accommodation, Online Booking Category:Geography of South Australia Category:Peninsulas of Australia",
