 "text": "The Bornean flying frog (Rhacophorus borneensis) is a frog. Scientists have seen it in Borneo in Malaysia. This frog lives high in tall trees, so scientists do not know much about it. They do not know what the male frog sounds like when he sings. They do not know what the eggs or tadpoles look like. Scientists saw some frogs sitting on branches 1 m over a pool of water, so they think the frogs might lay eggs on branches so that tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch. This frog is about 50.9 mm long from nose to rear end. It has large disks on its toes for climbing. Its feet have webbed skin all the way to the climbing disks. This frog has green skin on its back and a white mouth. The skin of the front legs near the body is black with yellow spots and blue spots. The skin of the sides is yellow-orange with black spots. Some of the webbed skin is yellow-orange. Some is black with blue marks. The skin of the belly is yellow-orange in color. The iris of the eye is red in color. Male and female frogs both have black color on their back legs, but the female also has blue spots. There are fewer of this frog than there were because people catch the frogs to sell as pets, because people cut down forests to get wood to build things with, and because people catch the frog to use it to make medicines. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
