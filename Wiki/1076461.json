He is Professor Emeritus of social epidemiology at the University of Nottingham. He retired in 2008. He is also Honorary Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London and Visiting Professor at University of York. In 2009, Richard co-founded The Equality Trust. Richard was awarded a 2013 Silver Rose Award from Solidar for championing equality and the 2014 Charles Cully Memorial Medal by the Irish Cancer Society. In 1976, his article entitled 'Dear David Ennals' was published in New Society; at that time, David Ennals was Secretary of State for Social Services. The article led eventually to the 1980 publication of the Black Report on Inequalities in Health. He is best known for his book with his partner Kate Pickett The Spirit Level, first published in 2009, which argues that societies with more equal distribution of incomes have better health, fewer social problems such as violence, drug abuse, teenage births, mental illness, obesity, and others, and are more cohesive than ones in which the gap between the rich and poor is greater. In 2009 they started the Equality Trust, which campaigns for greater income equality.History- Book launch 'The Equality Trust was founded in 2009 by Bill Kerry, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett.' www.equalitytrust.org.uk ==Books== * * * Associated conference, November 1992 * * * * * * * * * Four volume set. * **Adapted as the 2016 documentary film The Divide.
