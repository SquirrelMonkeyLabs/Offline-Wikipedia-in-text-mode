It lives in India, Nepal, Myanmar, China, Singapore, East Timor, Japan, Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Bangladesh. People have seen it below 3,000 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is about 50 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 80 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown, brown-yellow, or red-brown in color. Most frogs have some markings on their backs. This frog can live in many different places, including gardens. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. There is a subspecies: the white-lipped tree frog (Polypedates leucomystax leucomystax). ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
