 "text": "The painted Indonesian tree frog, spotted tree froglet, Sumatra Indonesian tree frog, cinnamon tree frog, cinnamon frog, spotted tree frog, white-spotted tree frog, or white-spotted brown frog (Nyctixalus pictus) is a frog. It lives in Malaysia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. People have seen it between 50 and 1800 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have been cut down and grew back. It does not live in places where too many trees have been cut down. The female frog lays eggs in bits of water high up in the trees. The water is in holes in the trees. People have also seen the frogs breed in buckets of water. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. Some of the places where the frog lives are protected parks. Sometimes people catch this frog to sell as pets, but scientists do not think they do it enough to make the frog die out. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
