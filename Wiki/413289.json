The other is Jerry Maren. Duccini was the last surviving female from the movie and also the oldest. Her role in the movie as a Munchkin villager was not credited. Her most recent appearance was when she (along with the other surviving Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz) was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Duccini and other surviving Munchkins receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame While Duccini could not remember what she earned filming Oz in 2013. She said that the Munchkin village actors were paid $125 a week during filming. Duccini made the news again when Baroness Margaret Thatcher died and critics of the former Prime Minister tried to propel \"Ding- Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" on the radio charts to celebrate her passing. Duccini and Maren both called the campaign \"terrible\" and were saddened by the movement while insisting the song was never to be used in such a way. Duccini died on January 16, 2014 from natural causes in Las Vegas, Nevada, aged 95.Final female 'Oz' Munchkin Ruth Duccini dead at 95 ==References== ==Other websites== *The Wizard of Oz' Special Screening Honoring the Munchkins Photo Gallery * Category:1918 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American movie actors Category:American television actors Category:Actors from Minnesota Category:Writers from Minnesota Category:People with dwarfism",
