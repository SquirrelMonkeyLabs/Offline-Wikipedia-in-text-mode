He and his family were famous composers of dance music, especially waltzes. He is usually known as Johann Strauss I or Johann Strauss Sr (Senior), while his son, who was also called Johann, is usually known as Johann Strauss II or Johann Strauss Jnr (Junior). The waltz was just becoming popular in the early 19th century and Johann Strauss I wrote many delightful waltzes and other dance music for the court balls. His most famous tune is the Radetzky-March which became a musical symbol of the power of the Habsburg monarchy. == References == Category:1804 births Category:1849 deaths Category:Austrian composers Category:Austrian conductors Category:Romantic composers Category:Austrian Jews Category:Austrian Roman Catholics Category:Austrian violinists Category:Austrian classical musicians Category:Deaths from infectious disease Category:Musicians from Vienna",
