 "text": "The Cauca rocket frog (Colostethus mertensi) is a frog. It lives in Colombia. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 24 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 28 mm long. Most frogs in Colostethus do not have much webbed skin on their feet, but C. agilis does. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. This frog lives in cloud forests on hills and mountains. Scientists saw the frog between 2190 and 2600 meters above sea level on the Pacific Ocean side (west side) of the Andes Mountains. They have only seen it in forests and not anywhere else. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Parque Nacional Natural Munchique. Scientists think it might live in Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali too. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the male frog carries the tadpoles to ponds of water that dry up for part of the year, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Humans cut down the forests to make farms, to make places for cows to eat grass, to get wood to build with, and get good rocks out of the ground. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
