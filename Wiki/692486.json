 "text": "Pecora is a group of mammals which chew the cud: in other words they re-eat the same material a second time. This kind of eating is done by all ruminants. The main reason is that they eat grass, which is quite hard to digest. It has little food value, but it grows so widely that it is always available to animals which can digest it. Most pecorans, except Hydrotopes and Moschus have horns or antlers. \"Pecora\" comes from Latin meaning \"horned lifestock\". Some pecorans have horns, but the family Cervidae has antlers. == References == Category:Even-toed ungulates",
