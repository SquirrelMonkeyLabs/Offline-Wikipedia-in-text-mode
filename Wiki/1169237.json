It is very popular among the children of Meitei ethnicity of Manipur. It has traditional cultural meaning and is played by both boys and girls. The game is accompanied by singing, with players singing in a rhythmic pattern.Kirti Singh, Moirangthem. Folk Culture of Manipur. India: Manas Publications, 1993. p. 242 == Lyrics == == Analysis == In the phrase \"Nupa Khudei Thanasi,\" which means \"Then let's bid for Khudei,\" Khudei refers to a short cloth worn by Meitei men around the waist, covering up to the knee (Sanahal, 1969, p. 29). Manipur has always been a place of conflict, with battles between different clans and outsiders from Burma, Shan, Pong, and other areas. The early history of Manipur was marked by continuous fights and challenges, showing the strength and skills of its people. Meitei martial arts show the rich and unique culture of people who believe in nature spirits. Meitei stories often praise the bravery and strength of men. Seboti Kaonaba is one example, as it helps young boys get stronger. Girls also play a similar game. Manipur grows many tasty fruits and vegetables, like peaches and pears. The fruit called Heitroi (Puneala plum) represents the rich and fertile land of Manipur. == In popular culture == An eponymous music video album 'Se Se Seboti' by Malem and Matou Production was released in 2023 at Ibotombi Khumancha's home in Yairipok Bishnunaha Pukhri Achouba Mapal.
