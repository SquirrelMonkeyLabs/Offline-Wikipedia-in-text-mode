 "text": "Mary Jane Kelly ( â€“ 9 November 1888), also known as Marie Jeanette Kelly, Fair Emma, Ginger, Dark Mary and Black Mary, is widely believed to have been the last victim of the unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper murdered at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London between late August and early November 1888. When she was killed, Kelly was about 25 years old, working as a prostitute and living in relative poverty.Eddleston, Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia p. 197 The other four victims were different: they had been killed outside. Their mutilations could have been done within minutes. Kelly was murdered inside, in the room that she rented at 13 Miller's Court. This gave her murderer a lot more time to mutilate her. Her murderer disemboweled her as well. Kelly's body was the most mutilated one of all the confirmed victims. Her murderer needed about two hours to perform these mutilations. == References == Category:1863 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Victims of Jack the Ripper",
