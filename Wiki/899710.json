 "text": "Pseudis platensis is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Scientists used to think this was the same frog as Pseudis paradoxa. They said it was a subspecies. They called it Pseudis paradoxa platensis. Then, in 2007, scientists looked at the frog's genes. The genes of Pseudis platensis were different enough from Pseudis paradoxa to say it was its own species. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
