It was created after Donald Trump left the original show when he became President of the United States. Arnold Schwarzenegger took over as the \"boss\" of the celebrities. The show featured sixteen celebrities who competed against each other in two teams. The teams would have to perform challenges. The winning team got money for their charities but one person from the losing team was removed from the game each episode. Schwarzenegger left the show because Donald Trump kept criticising it. NBC cancelled the show shortly after. == Contestants == No. Name Age Known for Result Left 1 Matt Iseman 45 TV presenter Winner Task 13 2 Boy George 55 Musician Runner-up 3 Brooke Burke 45 TV presenter Eliminated Task 12 4 Laila Ali 39 Boxing champion Eliminated Task 11 5 Lisa Leslie 44 Basketball player Eliminated Task 10 6 Carson Kressley 47 TV presenter Eliminated 7 Ricky Williams 39 NFL player Eliminated Task 9 8 Porsha Williams 35 Socialite Eliminated Task 8 9 Chael Sonnen 39 MMA fighter Removed 10 Vince Neil 55 Singer Eliminated Task 7 11 Jon Lovitz 59 Comedian Eliminated Task 6 12 Kyle Richards 48 Socialite Eliminated Task 5 13 Nicole Polizzi 29 Reality TV star Eliminated Task 4 14 Eric Dickerson 56 NFL player Eliminated Task 3 15 Carnie Wilson 48 Musician Eliminated Task 2 16 Carrie Keagan 36 Talk show host Eliminated Task 1 Category:American reality television series",
