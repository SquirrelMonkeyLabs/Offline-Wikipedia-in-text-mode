 "text": "The National League is a league for Association football teams in England (though some teams come from Wales). It is the fifth highest division of the English football league system. The league is made up of professional and non professional clubs. == History == The league was created in 1979 from the Northern Premier League and the Southern League. In 1987, teams began to be promoted to Football League Two, and since 2003, a second team was also promoted. The league was renamed from the Conference National to the National League in 2015. Vanarama also announced their sponsorship the same year, so the league became the Vanarama National League. In 2004, two divisions were created below the main league, known as the National League North and National League South. In 2006, the league expanded from 22 to 24 teams. == Champions == Season Champions 2013–14 Luton Town 2014–15 Barnet 2015–16 Cheltenham Town 2016–17 Lincoln City 2017–18 Macclesfield Town 2018–19 Leyton Orient 2019–20 Barrow 2020–21 Sutton United 2021–22 Stockport County 2022–23 Wrexham National Category:1979 establishments in the United Kingdom == References == Category:Football in England",
