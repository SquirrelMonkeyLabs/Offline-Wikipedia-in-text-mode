 "text": "The Upper Peninsula of Michigan (UP), also known as Upper Michigan, is the northern of the two major peninsulas that make up the U.S. state of Michigan. The peninsula is north by Lake Superior, on the east by the St. Marys River, on the southeast by Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, and on the southwest by Wisconsin. The Upper Peninsula has 29% of the land area of Michigan but just 3% of its total population. Residents are frequently called Yoopers. The peninsula's largest cities are Marquette, Sault Ste. Marie, Escanaba, Menominee, Houghton, and Iron Mountain. Maple syrup is a highly prized local delicacy. ==References== Category:Geography of Michigan Category:Peninsulas of the United States",
