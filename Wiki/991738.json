 "text": "Cassette 50 (Galaxy 50 - 50 Excitantes Juegos in Spain) is a video game compilation created by Cascade Games Ltd in 1983. Its 50 games were almost always written in BASIC. It was advertised a lot in home computer magazines. It came with a free Timex digital calculator watch. The instructions say \"the games will provide many hours of entertainment for all the family at a fraction of the cost of other computer games\".Cassette 50 inlay text In an interview, Matthew Lewis said he wrote Galaxy Defence in 12 hours at the age of 14. He sent it after seeing a small, anonymous ad in a local newspaper, losing the game's copyright and getting Â£10. His father, Ernest, drew the graphics.Cassette 50: the interview | pixeltron ==Games== Only some games are on all platforms (e.g. Star Trek and Maze Eater). Some games are ports or clones of older or popular games (e.g. Lunar Lander). Some games are made by independent developers. Some games with the same name between platforms are a different game. Some games have problems that make them harder to play. ===Acorn Electron / Commodore 64 / Dragon 32 / Oric-1 / Oric Atmos / ZX81=== * Attacker * Barrel Jump * Black Hole * Boggles * Cannonball Battle * Derby Dash * Do Your Sums * Dynamite * Exchange * Force Field * Galactic Attack * Galactic Dog Fight * Ghosts * Hangman * High Rise * Inferno * Intruder * Ivasive Action * Jet Flight * Jet Mobile * Lunar Landing * Maze Eater * Motorway * Nim * Noughts and Crosses * Old Bones * Orbitter * Overtake * Parachute * Phaser * Planets * Plasma Bolt * Pontoon * Psion Attack * Radar Landing * Rats * Rocket Launch * Sitting Target * Ski Jump * Smash the Windows * Space Mission * Space Search * Space Ship * Star Trek * Submarines * Tanker * The Force * Thin Ice * Tunnel Escape * Universe Exchange and The Force are not in the Acorn Electron version, but are listed on the inlay.
