When the Metropolitans became the first U.S.-based team to win the Stanley Cup in 1917, Morris scored 14 of Seattle's goals (in a best-of- five series). ==Playing career== Born in Brandon, Manitoba, Morris played for several senior teams in Manitoba and Saskatchewan before joining the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) in 1914. He moved over to Seattle the following season, and played eight seasons for Seattle, and was a member of the Stanley Cup champion 1917 team. He played in two other Finals, the ill-fated 1919 series, and the 1923 series. He had an outstanding 1917 series, scoring 14 goals in four games. In 1923, he joined the Calgary Tigers and played a season and a half before joining the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). From 1925 unil 1930, he finished his career with various teams in the minor California Pro League, the Can-Pro and International League. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1890 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Boston Bruins players Category:Ice hockey people from Brandon, Manitoba Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Canadian ice hockey centres",
