 "text": "A writ of (; Latin: \"may you have the body\") protects people from being kept in jail or prison without a legal reason and without any end date. It is a writ (legal action) that says that if someone who was arrested or imprisoned wants to go to court to argue that they are being held illegally, the prison official must bring the individual to the court. Once the person is brought before the court, the judge will decide if the person is being held lawfully, or has the right to be released. == References == ==Related pages== *Civil and political rights ==Other websites== * ACLU: Background on Habeas Corpus * Library of Congress: Magna Carta: Muse and Mentor * This American Life: 331: Habeas Schmabeas 2007 * Habeas Corpus Resource Center Category:Human rights Category:Latin phrases Category:Law enforcement",
