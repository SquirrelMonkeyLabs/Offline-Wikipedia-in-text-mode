 "text": "Massimo Bertaccini (born November 20, 1967) is an Italian mathematician, inventor, author, and entrepreneur specializing in cryptography, quantum computing, and neural interface technologies. == Early life and education == Bertaccini was born in Italy. He graduated from Liceo Statale Severi in Faenza before earning a Bachelor of Science in Finance from the University of Bologna. He later received his Ph.D. in Financial Computing from the Constantinian University in Rhode Island, United States. == Career == === Cryptography and cybersecurity === Bertaccini started his interest in cryptography in 2006 and received his first patent, MB09, in 2009 for a new encryption system. In 2010, he initiated a Financial Encrypted Telecommunications project with Vodafone. In 2011, he patented MB11 and later explored crypto-digital payment systems, preceding the rise of Bitcoin. In 2012, he founded Cryptolab, focusing on encrypted search engines and homomorphic encryption. In 2015, he incorporated Cryptolab Inc. in California, launching the first search engine for encrypted data, CSE. In 2017, Cryptolab was selected for government funding to develop cybersecurity solutions. In 2023, Cryptolab was recognized among the best cybersecurity startups in California. === Brain Interface: BrainWaves Project === In 2016, Bertaccini began working on brain-computer authentication, leading to the BrainWaves Project. Innovations include: * BrainMouse: Allows users to control a computer using brain activity. * BrainDrone: Pilots drones through neural commands. * Brain_Password: Uses brainwave patterns for authentication. At CES 2023, Bertaccini demonstrated the world's first drone piloted via brainwaves. In 2024, he showcased a BrainWaves application assisting disabled individuals. === Quantum laboratory === In 2024, Bertaccini established the Quantum and Robotics Laboratory at the Adriano Olivetti Academy Foundation, where research focuses on quantum cryptography and brain interfaces. The lab facilitates experiments on Quantum key distribution (QKD), BB84, and quantum encryption. == Selected publications == === Books === * Bertaccini, M. (2022). Cryptography Algorithms. Packt Publishing. * Bertaccini, M. (2024). Cryptography Algorithms (2nd ed.). Packt Publishing. === Journal articles === * Bertaccini, M. (2023). \"An introduction to a new lightweight encryption algorithm: Cybpher\". Cryptography Algorithms (2nd ed.). * Bertaccini, M., Privitera, R., & La Rosa, D.
