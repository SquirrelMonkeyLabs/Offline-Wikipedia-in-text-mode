 "text": "\"My Life Would Suck Without You\" is a song from American singer Kelly Clarkson. It was the first single from her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted. It was her second number-one hit in Canada and the United States and her first chart-topper in the UK. This song was released on January 31, 2009. The song has the largest jump to number one in Billboard Hot 100 history. It was also the biggest leap on the chart ever until 2019, when Taylor Swift broke this record. \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" entered at #97 and moved to the top the following week. In 2017, in a radio interview with Z100 in New York City, Clarkson discussed Dr. Luke (who was involved in a lawsuit with singer Kesha for reported assault). She claimed: Clarkson also said that she usually asks for writing credits if she knows she created a fair-sized portion of a song. She says she lost \"millions\" of dollars in royalties by not being listed on the writing credits of the song. ==Charts== Chart (2009) Peak position Bulgaria 2 ==References== Category:2009 songs Category:Kelly Clarkson songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number one songs",
