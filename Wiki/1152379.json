After Nandivarman's death, his son Dantivarman likely became king before 804, probably around 795. He ruled for over 51 years, as indicated by his latest inscription from Tiruch-chanur in Chittoor District. During his reign, he faced conflict with the Rashtrakutas under Govinda III, who became king in 794. Govinda III invaded Pallava territory, captured Kanchi, and defeated Dantivarman who sued for peace also forcing him to pay the tribute. By 804-805, Govinda III retreated to his camp at Ramesvara-tirtha near the Tungabhadra River. An inscription on a pillar in Hulibidu, Bellary District, from the fourth year, mentions the death of a hero named Sirigoppa, who died while fighting against the army of Danti, which had attacked Chikurambavi village. This Danti is likely identified as Dantivarman, who may have attacked the village, which was under the Rattas, who were subordinates of the Rashtrakutas. This could help explain why Govinda temporarily took control of Kanchi. Another record from Govinda III (806 AD) mentions a land grant made at the request of Bāṇarāja Sriparama for a temple. == References == Category:Battles",
