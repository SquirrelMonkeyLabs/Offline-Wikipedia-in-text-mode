 "text": "Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that is often used by scientists and mathematicians to make it easier to write large and small numbers. A number that is written in scientific notation has several properties that make it very useful to local scientists. It makes very large numbers into smaller numbers using decimals and exponents. == Variations == The basic idea of scientific notation is to express zeros as a power of ten. The notation for this can be written as : a\\,\\times\\,10^b\\\\! where b is an integer, or \"whole\" number, that describes the number of times 10 is multiplied by itself and the letter a any real number, called the significand or mantissa (using \"mantissa\" may cause confusion as it can also refer to the fractional part of the common logarithm). === Normalized notation === Written in the form , exponent b is chosen such that the absolute value of a remains at least one but less than ten (1 \\le \\left | a \\right \\vert < 10\\\\!). Normal mathematics convention dictates a minus sign to precede the first of the decimal digits of a for a negative number; that of b for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1, e.g. minus one half is . There is no need to represent zero in normalized form, the digit 0 is sufficient. The normalized form allows easy comparison of two numbers of the same sign in a, as the exponent b gives the number's order of magnitude. == Other websites == * Scientific Notation in Everyday Life * An exercise in converting to and from scientific notation * Scientific Notation Calculator and Converter Category:Measurement Category:Notation Category:Numerals",
