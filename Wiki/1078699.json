 "text": "Post-left anarchism is a set of beliefs in contemporary anarchism which critique traditional leftist thoughts. It believes that leftism is too centered on tactics such as syndicalism, vanguardism and parliamentarianism and that it is too outdated. The four main schools of thought it combines are egoism, communism, post-civilizationism and anarchism.

It proposes as an alternative critical self-theory, which is a way an individual creates his own beliefs beyond limitations of ideology. This means that post-left anarchism is not a unified theory.

Notable post-left anarchists include John Zerzan, Hakim Bey and Bob Black. Anarchism",
