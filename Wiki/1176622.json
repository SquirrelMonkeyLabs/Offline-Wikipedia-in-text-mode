 "text": "Park Place is a large mall on the East Side of Tucson, Arizona, United States. The anchor stores are Century Theatres, Dillard's, Round 1 Entertainment, Total Wine & More, Ulta Beauty, and Old Navy. There is one vacant anchor store that was once Macy's. == History == Park Place was originally called Park Mall in May 1975, but was renewed in the beginning in 1998 and renamed Park Place the next year. The mall is named after Sears Park, which was originally located at the same site and included what was originally a standalone Sears store (which first opened in the fall of 1965), which became the mall's major anchor (the \"Sears Park\" site is presently limited to its extreme southern and western portion). The original stores that opened along with Sears were additional anchors The Broadway (became Macy's in 1996), Furrâ€™s Cafeteria, Mann Theatres, and Diamond's (became Dillard's in 1986), as well as 51 other stores. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Park Place, into Sertiage Growth Properties. The Sears store later closed in 2018 as part of the company's ongoing financial woes, and was replaced by a Round1 in October 2019. The electric substation on the premises is named Sears Substation because it was there a decade before the mall was built. From 1970 to 1996 the owner was the mall's original developer, Joseph Kivel.[citation needed] On May 28, 2020, it was announced that Macy's would be closing in late 2020. After Macy's closed, Dillard's became the only traditional anchor store left. In the summer of 2023, the mall was under new ownership and management as the mall was sold to Pacific Retail for $87 million from Brookfield Properties. == Renewal (1998-2000) == The 1,100,000-square-foot (100,000 m2), $100 million renewal, completed in 2001, was recognized that year as a Reader's Pick for Best Contemporary Art in Tucson Weekly's Best of Tucson awards. The renewal included the addition of an Old Navy, Borders, and Abercrombie & Fitch. The mall features two anchor stores (Dillard's and Round One Entertainment), a food court, a Southwest- themed children's play area, and a cineplex with 20 screens. A number of full- service restaurants are also located on site. == References == * https://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1995/05/27/29343-two-malls-part-of-kivel-s- legacy/ * https://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1999/11/19/190613-park-mall-floor- to-hide-time-capsule-until-2040/ * https://www.kold.com/story/38133807/sears- park-place-round1-bowling-entertainment/https://tucson.com/news/local/govt- and-politics/rio-nuevo-plan-adds-el-con-park- malls/article_ecad6a14-9ac3-11e1-a34f-0019bb2963f4.html == Other websites == * https://parkplacemall.com/ * https://historicalaerials.com Category:Malls Category:Buildings and structures in Arizona",
