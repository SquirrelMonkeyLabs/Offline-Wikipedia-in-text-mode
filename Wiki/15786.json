 "text": "Warren Gamaliel Harding (November 2, 1865 â€“ August 2, 1923) was the 29th president of the United States from 1921 until his death in 1923. Before becoming president, he was a senator and the assistant governor of Ohio. Before he was in government, he was an important newspaper manager. He was a Republican. ==Presidency== After World War I, he was elected on the promise to return the United States back to normal. He supported limited government in the economy. During his term, he lowered taxes and believed that the economy should not be regulated too much. In 1922, Harding became the first president to have his voice transmitted by radio as he addressed a crowd in Baltimore. Warren G. Harding made the mistake of appointing his friends to high political positions. As a result, they corruptly abused their power for their personal gain and several scandals happened during his presidency, including the infamous Teapot Dome scandal based in Teapot Dome in Wyoming and involving Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. Other untrustworthy people included Edward Doheny and Harry Sinclair. ==Death== He died in office of a heart attack in 1923 while he was visiting New York. == Personal life == Harding cheated on his wife with Carrie Phillips, a family friend. She supported Germany during World War I. In fact, many people thought she was a spy. He also cheated with Nan Britton, who was over 30 years younger than him. He fathered a child with Britton. Afterward, she wrote a book called The President's Daughter, telling her story, but most people didn't believe her. However, in 2015, DNA testing confirmed that she was telling the truth about the baby. ==What happened after his death== His vice president Calvin Coolidge became president after he died. Historians consider him one of the worst presidents because of all the scandals he created as president and he was very corrupt (taking bribes). ==References== == Other websites == * Harding's White House biography Category:1865 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:United States senators from Ohio Category:Republican Party (United States) politicians Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Lieutenant Governors of Ohio Category:20th- century presidents of the United States",
