It lives in Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Scientists think it might live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia too. This is a large frog. The adult male frog is 43-75 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 60-90 mm long. The skin of the frog's back can be brown, gray, or white. There is much webbed skin on the feet. People see this frog in grassy land with some trees, places with woody plants smaller than trees, other grassy places, farms, places where animals eat grass, and places where people live, not far from cities. They see this frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. The female frog finds a small body of water that dries up for part of the year. She lays her eggs there. She lays them in a nest made out of foam. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. It can live in many kinds of places. Sometimes people catch this frog to sell it as a pet. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
