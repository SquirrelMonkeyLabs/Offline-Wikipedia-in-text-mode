 "text": "The phosphorus cycle includes the following steps: * Phosphorus in fertilizer, rocks, and mountains is distributed by rain to nearby land and bodies of water * Animals eat the plants grown by fertilizer. They expel the phosphorus as waste. It eventually reaches the water as runoff. * Phosphorus is cycled through animals that live in water. It is eventually deposited into the ocean floor. * Phosphates contribute to the sediment at the bottom of the water. That sediment becomes rock * The ocean bed eventually becomes a mountain range over several millions of years because of normal geological functions * The phosphorus in those mountain ranges is washed off into bodies of water and the cycle begins again and again. == Diagram == Phosphorus cycle.png|The Phosphorus cycle == References == *Friedland, Andrew J., Rick Relyea, and David Courard-Hauri. \"The Phosphorus Cycle.\" Environmental Science for AP*.
