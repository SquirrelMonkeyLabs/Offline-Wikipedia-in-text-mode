 "text": "The term whatever is American slang. It means whatever you say or I do not care what you say. It is used to dismiss something someone else has said. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the word became a sentence in its own right. The character Archie Bunker, from the show All in the Family, used the phrase often to dismiss his wife Edith in the 1970s. It was strongly prevalent among teenagers in the 1980s and 1990s. == References == Category:Slang",
