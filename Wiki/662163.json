 "text": "Soyuz MS-10 was a manned Soyuz spaceflight which aborted shortly after launch on 11 October 2018 in Russia. The mission lasted roughly 30 minutes before being aborted. MS-10 was the 139th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. It was planned to transport two members of the Expedition 57 crew to the International Space Station. A few minutes after liftoff, the craft went into contingency abort due to a booster failure and had to return to Earth. Both crew members, Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague, were recovered alive in good health. The MS-10 flight abort was the first instance of a manned booster accident at high altitude in 43 years, since Soyuz 18a similarly failed to achieve orbit in April 1975. ==References== Category:2018 in Russia Category:Spacecraft Category:October 2018 events Category:2010s in spaceflight",
