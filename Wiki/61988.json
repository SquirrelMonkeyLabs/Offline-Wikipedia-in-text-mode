 "text": "Juan Domingo Perón (October 8, 1895 – July 1, 1974) was an Argentine general and politician who served as the 29th president of Argentina from 1946 to his overthrow in 1955, and again as the 40th president from 1973 to his death in 1974. Born in Buenos Aires, he was elected President of Argentina in 1946 and ruled with his second wife, Eva Perón. He was overthrown in 1955 and forced to leave the country. In 1973, he returned; ran for president again with his third wife, Isabel Perón, as vice-president; and was elected. He died in Buenos Aires in 1974, less than a year after his election. His widow, Isabel, took his place, which made her the first woman president in the world. In Argentina, he and Eva (popularly known as Evita) are considered icons by many people, especially members of the Perónist Justicialist Party, which he started and is still popular. He was very popular with the working class because he was the first politician in a long time to care about them. He required businesses to pay decent wages and safe conditions. He carried out cother social reforms but also controlled what could be said over the radio and sent people opposing him to jail. He also controlled trade unions and businesses and so although they had power, the government had the last word.
