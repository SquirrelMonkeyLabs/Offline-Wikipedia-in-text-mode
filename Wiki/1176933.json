 "text": "The ornate cloud frog (Aromobates ornatissimus) is a frog. It lives in Trujillo, Venezuela. ==Body== This frog is bright green in color and it has a bright pattern on its back and sides. It also has dark stropes on the sides of its body. Many Aromobates frogs that have bright colors are poisonous, but this frog is not. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day. It lives near streams in the mountains in cloud forests and in streams that go through places where animals eat grass. Scientists think it can live in some place that human beings have changed. Scientists first saw this frog in Las Palmas in Carache, but they found it in other places after that. They found the frog between 1,139 and 2,394 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog might live in Dinira National Park but they have not written about finding it there. ==Young== The male frog hides in water plants or under rocks or behind waterfalls and calls to the female frogs. Sometimes they call in the forest, far from water. Scientists believe that the female frog lays her eggs on land and that the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where the frog lives to make small farms and places for animals to eat grass. Bad chemicals from farms and human and cows waste can get into the streams where the frogs live. Human beings also move streams to use the water. Diseases can also hurt this frog. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
