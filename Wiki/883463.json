 "text": "The semiaquatic tree frog (Sarcohyla pachyderma) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have only seen it in one place, the eastern side of the Sierra Madre mountains in Veracruz, 1600 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog is in very big danger of dying out. They think these frogs might all be dead now, but they are not sure. Scientists only ever saw this frog in one stream and they have not seen it since 1940. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
