Accessed 15 May 2011. == Band history == === Eurovision win === Both Eldar and Nigar had separately entered the selection contest for Azerbaijan's Eurovision Song Contest entry. They both won and were made into a duo under the name Ell & Nikki. As the contest was taking place in a Western European country, the name change was made to prevent confusion of Jamal's first name being interpreted as a racial slur. Their entry, named \"Running Scared\", was written by Stefan Ã–rn and Sandra Bjurman from Sweden and Iain Farquharson from the UK. The performance included four backing vocalists and singers, including Jessica Marberger and Vera Prada who had earlier in the year attempted to represent Sweden as part of Shirley's Angels. === After Eurovision === Following their win, Eldar was one of the presenters of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. Both of them handed the trophy to 2012's winner Loreen. Eldar was also a judge on the Azerbaijani version of The Voice. In 2014, Nigar was a judge on the Turkish version of The X Factor. She lives in the United Kingdom. == References == Category:Eurovision Song Contest winners Category:Musical duos",
