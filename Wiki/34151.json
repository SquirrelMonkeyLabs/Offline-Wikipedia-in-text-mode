 "text": "A leech, plural leeches, is a kind of worm that live in wet areas. Some only live in water, but some, called terrestrial leeches, can live on land. Terrestrial leeches can only live in wet and humid areas. Some leeches that live in water can swim. Leeches have 34 connected parts, called segments, that make up the body. Some leeches are predators, and eat other small animals, called invertebrates. Other leeches drink the blood of bigger animals, including humans. == References == Category:Annelids",
