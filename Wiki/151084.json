 "text": "The Musikverein in Vienna, Austria is one of the most famous concert halls in the world. It opened on 6 January 1870, and is known for its acoustics. The world-famous Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra performs at Musikverein. The concert hall was built by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Society of Friends of Music) who had been given the land by Emperor Franz Joseph. In 1907 a beautiful organ was put in the Konzerthaus by the Austrian firm of organ builders Rieger. The main auditorium is called the Goldener Saal (The Golden Hall). There are seats for 1,744 people and standing room for another 300. The Brahms Hall is also in the Musikverein building, and seats close to 600. Four more concert halls were added underneath the main building in 2004: the Glass Hall with 380 seats, the Steel Room with 70 seats, the Stone Room with 60 seats, and the Wood Room with 50 seats. Every year on 1 January the Vienna New Year's Concert is held here. Millions of people in countries all over the world watch this concert on New Year's Day. ==References== Category:Concert halls",
