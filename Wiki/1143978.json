 "text": "Alexander V (born Pietro Philarges di Candia, c. 1339 â€“ 3 May 1410) was an antipope from 1409 until his death in 1410. He was chosen by a group of cardinals during the Western Schism. == Early life == Pietro was born in Heraklion on the island of Crete, which was part of the Republic of Venice. He joined the Franciscan Order as a young man and studied theology in Padua, Norwich, and Oxford. Later, he taught at the universities in Paris and Padua. In 1402, he was made Archbishop of Milan. == Antipope == During the Western Schism, the Council of Pisa in 1409 declared both Pope Gregory XII and Antipope Benedict XIII as illegitimate. The cardinals elected Pietro as the new pope, and he took the name Alexander V. However, his election did not end the schism and instead added a third rival pope. == Death == Alexander V died suddenly on 3 May 1410 in Bologna. His death was followed by the election of Antipope John XXIII. == Legacy == Alexander V's brief reign is remembered as a part of the failed attempt to end the Western Schism. He is considered an antipope because his election did not follow the usual process, and he was one of several rival popes at the time. == References == == Other websites == * Catholic Hierarchy: Pietro Cardinal Filargis, O.F.M.
