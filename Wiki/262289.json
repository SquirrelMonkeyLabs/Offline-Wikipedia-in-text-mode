 "text": "A headlamp is a light bulb mounted on the front of a machine. Normally it is mounted on a car. It shines forward. It can be turned on and off. It is used to see ahead of the machine so it wouldn't drive into trees or telephone poles. Incandescent bulbs and a variant known as halogen bulbs are the most common types. They are normally bright. ==Related pages== *Fluorescent bulb *Mercury-vapor lamp *Sodium vapor lamp Category:Light sources",
