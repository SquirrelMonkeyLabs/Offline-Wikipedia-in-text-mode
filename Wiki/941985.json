 "text": "The Chris Pincher scandal is a political controversy in the United Kingdom about allegations of sexual harassment by the former Conservative Party Deputy Chief Whip, Chris Pincher. In early July 2022, allegations of Pincher's misconduct came out, including rumors that go back to his appointment as Deputy Chief Whip. The government denied that at the time of Pincher's appointment, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, had any knowledge of any complaints about Pincher. Johnson later had to admit that that was not the case. The scandal created a major crisis for Johnson's government, with ministers, and a larger number of government staff, resigning on 5â€“7 July 2022. This eventually caused in Johnson's announcement on 7 July that he would resign as party leader and prime minister. ==References== Category:July 2022 events",
