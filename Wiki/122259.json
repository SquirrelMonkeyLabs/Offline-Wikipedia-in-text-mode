 "text": "Saint-Maurice-d'Ardèche is a commune in the Ardèche département in southern France. ==History== Saint-Maurice was built around a Benedictine convent in the 11th century. The commune changed its name many times. Before the French Revolution the name was Saint-Maurice-Terlin (contraction of Terre à lin - Land of Flax) because the inhabitants grew flax. The village then became Saint Maurice Torsinet in 1793. Eight years later, in 1801, the name was changed again, first to Saint-Maurice-en-Lanas then Saint-Maurice-et-Lanas. In 1846 it was simply Saint-Maurice. The current name, Saint-Maurice-d'Ardèche appeared between 1846 and 1861. It is because the commune is close to the river Ardèche. ==Geography== The village is between the communes of Aubenas and Ruoms. It is close to the river Ardèche. There are many vineyards there. ==Demography== ==References== Category:Communes in Ardèche",
