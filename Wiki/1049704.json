 "text": "Roarchestes flaviocularis is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it between 1459 and 1569 meters above sea level in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 1400 and 1600 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog on Ochlandra grass and high up in the trees where the branches come together like a roof. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place, and this place is changing. Climate chance could kill this frog: Because many frogs live high up in the hills, they cannot move away north if their home becomes hotter. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, can live on other frogs in Raorchestes, so scientists think it could make this frog sick too. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
