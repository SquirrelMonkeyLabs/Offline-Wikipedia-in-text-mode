 "text": "In Geometry, the golden angle is the smaller of the two angles created by sectioning the circumference of a circle according to the golden ratio into two arcs. according to algebra, let a+b be the circumference of a circle, divided into a longer arc of length a and a smaller arc of length b such that: : \\frac{a + b}{a} = \\frac{a}{b} The golden angle is then the angle subtended by the smaller arc of length b.
