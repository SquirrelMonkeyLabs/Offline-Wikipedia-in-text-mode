 "text": "Paratransit (the term used in North America) or intermediate public transport (also known by other names such as community transport (UK)), is a type of transportation services that adds to fixed-route mass transit by providing rides without fixed routes or timetables to individual people.Merriam Webster dictionary Retrieved 2019-10-10 Paratransit services may vary a lot on the degree of flexibility they provide their customers. At their simplest they may consist of a taxi or small bus that will run along a more or less defined route and then stop to pick up or discharge passengers on request. At the other end of the service demand-responsive transport provides the most flexible paratransit systems offering on-demand call-up door-to-door service from any origin to any destination in a service area. In addition to public transit agencies, paratransit services may be operated by community groups or not-for-profit organizations, and for-profit private companies or operators. Typically, minibuses are used to provide paratransit service in the USA. Most paratransit vehicles are equipped with wheelchair lifts or ramps to give access. In the United States, private transportation companies often provide paratransit service in cities and metropolitan areas under contract to local public transportation agencies. == References == Category:Public transport",
