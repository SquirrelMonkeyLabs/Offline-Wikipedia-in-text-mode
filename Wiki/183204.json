 "text": "An icosagon is a shape with 20 sides and 20 corners. It has interior angles of 162 and exterior angles of 18. == Regular icosagon == The regular icosagon has Schl√§fli symbol {20}, and can also be constructed as a truncated decagon, t{10}, or a twice-truncated pentagon, tt{5}. === Area === The amount of space a regular icosagon takes up is :\\text{Area} = {5}a^2(1+\\sqrt{5}+\\sqrt{5+2\\sqrt{5}}). a is the length of one of its sides. ==Uses== The Big Wheel on the popular US game show The Price Is Right has an icosagonal cross-section. The Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare's acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989.Muriel Pritchett, University of Georgia \"To Span the Globe\" , see also Editor's Note, retrieved on 10th January 2016 As a golygonal path, the swastika is considered to be an irregular icosagon. A regular square, pentagon, and icosagon can completely fill a plane vertex. == Dissection== Coxeter states that every parallel-sided 2m-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the icosagon, m=10, and it can be divided into 45: 5 squares and 4 sets of 10 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 10-cube, with 45 of 11520 faces. Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 The list A006245 enumerates the number of solutions as 18,410,581,880, including up to 20-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.
