They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation. == History == In the 13th century the names of Heusenstamm and Rembrücken were written down in documents for the first time. Formerly the people in the Heusenstamm area were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the rhein main region got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing, also chemical processing. Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly. == Twinned cities == * Saint-Savin, France * Tonbridge, England * Malle, Belgium * Ladispoli, Italy == References == == Other websites == *Official website of Heusenstamm * Category:Offenbach (district)",
