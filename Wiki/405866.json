North-Western Territory was added to the sphere of influence of the company. In 1869, the company sold its rights to both territories to the Canadian Dominion, which was the predecessor of modern-day Canada. In 1870, the Manitoba Act created the Canadian province Manitoba. Rupert's land was split: Parts of it were added to Saskatchewan, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. In 1818, the border between Canada and the US was defined along the 49th latitude. This means that part of Rupert's land today make up the states Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and South Dakota. In addition, Rupert's land is an ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Church of Canada. It is also the name of an Anglican diocese in Manitoba.slay Category:Historical territories of Canada Category:British North America",
