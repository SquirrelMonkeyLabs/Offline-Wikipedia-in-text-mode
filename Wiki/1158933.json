 "text": "The Salado River (,| \"Salty River\") is a river that crosses several provinces of Argentina, flowing from its source in the Salta Province to end in the Paran√° River, in the Santa Fe Province. ==Higher Salado== The Salado originates on the eastern edge of the Altiplano under the name of Juramento River at the Andes range, from thaw and captured precipitations of the high Acay and Cachi mountains in the Salta Province, near Catamarca Province. The Cabra Corral Dam regulates its flow, and deviates some of it for irrigation. When the river enters the Gran Chaco plains it forms several arms in a broad riverbed only partially occupied. ==References== Category:Rivers of Argentina",
