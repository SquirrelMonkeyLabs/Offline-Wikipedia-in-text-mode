 "text": "The lunar south pole is a place on the Moon. It has a special interest because ice seems to be inside the craters. As the moon orbits, it keeps one face always opposite the Earth. So when the Sun shines on it, it shines obliquely on the poles. Thus it never reaches the ice inside the craters, and the water stays frozen. The same pattern might apply to the Moon's northern pole, but that has fewer craters. == References == Category:Surface features of the Moon",
