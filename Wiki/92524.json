 "text": "Märkisch-Oderland is a Kreis (district) in the eastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. ==Geography== Much of the district is mainly agricultural land, but there is a swampy area along the Oder called the Oderbruch. The Oderbruch is about in length and in width. It was partially drained in the 18th century, and people started to live in the new area. ==History== The districts of Lebus and Oberbarnim were both created in 1816. In 1952, the districts were split into three parts, the districts Bad Freienwalde, Seelow and Strausberg. In 1993 the three parts were joined to form the current district. == Coat of arms == The coat of arms shows the eagle of Brandenburg in the upper half. The upper half also resembles the coat of arms of the former district Oberbarnim. In the lower half are two boat-hooks and a star, both taken from the coat of arms of the former district Seelow. The wavy line on the bottom represents the Oder river. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter # Altlandsberg # Bad Freienwalde # Müncheberg # Seelow # Strausberg # Wriezen Amt-free municipalities # Fredersdorf-Vogelsdorf # Hoppegarten # Letschin # Neuenhagen bei Berlin # Petershagen-Eggersdorf # Rüdersdorf bei Berlin 1\\.
