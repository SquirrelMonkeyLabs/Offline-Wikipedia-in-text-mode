 "text": "Sowa Rigpa aka Science of healing is an approach built upon the traditional Tibetan medicine, which has been enhanced by Chinese, Greek, and Ayurvedic treatments. == History == For over 2,500 years, communities in the highlands of Asia have utilized this ancient knowledge and practice, which is based on both intellectual and religious writings. One of the seven Ayush systems is Sowa-Rigpa; the word \"Sowa-Rigpa\" comes from the Bhoti language and means knowledge of healing. The Himalayan regions are the main locations where it is practiced. The knowledge and methods used by people living in Tibetan regions for treating illnesses and living are known as Sowa Rigpa, or Tibetan medicine. In November 2018, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) added it to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Sowa-Rigpa was acknowledged by the government of India in 2010. Once China, Bhutan, and Mongolia recognized Sowa- Rigpa, India became the fourth nation in the world to do so. The National Institute of Sowa-Rigpa was also founded by the Indian government's Ministry of Ayush in 2020 in Leh, Ladakh. In collaboration with the National Commission for Indian System of Medicine, 2023, the University Grants Commission of India has recognized the bachelor's degree program in Sowa Rigpa Medicine and Surgery. == References == Category:Tibet Category:Alternative medicine",
