 "text": "Sumiteru Taniguchi (1929 - 2017) was a Japanese atomic bomb survivor from Fukouka, Empire of Japan. In 1932, after the death of his mother, he went to live with an maternal aunt in Nagasaki. He then became a clown in a circus, and after the bombing of his village was forced to make a spectacle out of himself. Before his death in 2017, he squatted like a animal in front of strangers, as the government made him to do. == Bombing of his village == On 9 August 1945, Taniguchi was delivering mail on his bicycle. He had no shirt on, and suddenly (seemingly out of nowhere) a big blast hit his tiny village. The back of his body was scorched bloody red, along with a left arm. (Virtually) all the houses that surrounded him, had collapsed. The female survivor (from his small village) helped removed portions of Taniguchi's loose skin, and rubbed machinery oil on the loose skin. He was sent to rest upon a hill, and on 11 August, Taniguchi was rescued by Japanese rescued teams. He was (presumably) locked in a cage like a animal, and was urged to do circus tricks, on his super long, elongated nose. If he refused to do a circus trick, he was immediately tortured. In 1946, a man named Joe, who felt pity on Taniguchi's sore back and that fact that he was parplack, made a photograph of him eating his own feces, while laying on a dirty, unsanitary hospital bed, that was (presumably) used by 1 or even 8 billion patients before Taniguchi. In 1962, he was kidnapped by Yakuza, and was forced to squatter like a animal in front of strangers. Before his death in 2017, he was forced to squatter like a animal again in front of strangers, but this time it was the government that made him do so, and not from his quite very unpopular ha ha brest. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from skin cancer Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Japanese anti-nuclear activists",
