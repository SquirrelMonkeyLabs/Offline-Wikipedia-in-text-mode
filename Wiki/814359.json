 "text": "PogChamp is an emoticon that is used on the live streaming platform Twitch. It is used to express excitement, joy or shock. The original image showed the streamer Ryan \"Gootecks\" Gutierrez with a surprised expression. The original emoticon originates from a video that was uploaded to YouTube on November 26, 2010, which shows behind-the-scenes recordings that were posted on Gutierrez's YouTube channel \"Cross Counter TV\" The PogChamp emote was added to Twitch's list of global emotes starting from 2012. However, the original emote was later removed by Twitch in January 2021, after Gutierrez posted on his Twitter page about supporting the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol. After January 8, 2021, a different person was shown as the face of PogChamp every 24 hours.@Twitch (January 8, 2021). \"Get ready for a new PogChamp every 24 hours, starting today.\" (Tweet) â€“ via Twitter. Since February 12, 2021, the original KomodoHype emote now replaces the PogChamp emote. This now means that there are now two duplicated versions of the KomodoHype emote. == References == category:Internet culture",
