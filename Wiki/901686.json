Money studied education and psychology at Victoria University of Wellington. Money was a professor at Johns Hopkins University in the United States. Money made the \"theory of neutrality\", which argued that males and females are born without psychological differences. This lead him to conduct an experiment where he raised a boy as a girl, which failed. == References == Category:1921 births Category:2006 deaths Category:New Zealand academics Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty",
