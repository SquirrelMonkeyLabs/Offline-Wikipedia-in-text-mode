 "text": "Times New Roman is a serif typeface. It was made for legibility (easy reading) in body text. It was created by the British newspaper The Times in 1931. It was made by Stanley Morison, the artistic advisor to the British part of the newspaper. Victor Lardent, a lettering artist at Times advertising department, helped him make it. The font is no longer used by the Times newspaper. It is used mostly in books and general printing. It has become a regular typeface used on most computers. As a typeface used for newspapers, Times New Roman allows tight line-spacing and a smaller appearance. It was first seen in the Times on 3 October 1932. == Design == Times New Roman is packed together, with tall lowercase letters. These things make it easier to read. ==References== Category:Fonts Category:Latin-script typefaces",
