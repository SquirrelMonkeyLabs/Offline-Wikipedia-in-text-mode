 "text": "A split album is a music album which includes tracks by two or three separate artists. == History == Split albums were once made on vinyl records. One artist would record music on one side, and the other artist would record music on the other side. Vinyls would then become out of date, and CDs came around. A CD isn't really turned over the same way a vinyl record is, but the term \"sides\" is still used. Since the 1980's, the format was used by many record labels and artists in punk, hardcore punk, grindcore, black metal, noise, and indie rock. *",
