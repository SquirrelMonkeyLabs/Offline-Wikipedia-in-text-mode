The song was able to make it to #1 on the Alternative Airplay, #1 on the Mainstream Rock, #4 on the Mainstream Top 40, #5 on the Adult Top 40, and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). During an episode of Loudwire's \"Wikipedia: Fact Or Fiction?\", Stapp said that the song was about lucid dreaming. He said he made the song about a dream he had where he was hunted down and then killed by somebody with a gun. After studying lucid dreams, Stapp was able to have a dream where he escaped the man. A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Ramaa Mosley. In the video, the band is sitting backstage. They stand up and walk to the stage to perform in front of a crowd. Stapp performs while floating in the air. The end of the video starts the same way it started with the band walking to the stage. Stapp said he doesn't like the video anymore, saying \"Sometimes I cringe when I see it. Like, 'What was I thinking? Look at those pants.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1999 songs Category:Creed (band) songs Category:Rock ballads",
