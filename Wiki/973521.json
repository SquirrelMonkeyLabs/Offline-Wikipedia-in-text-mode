Players can use combos to unlock animated bonuses and record their mixes for a ranking. There is an automatic mode that randomly places sounds icons. == Gameplay == Incredibox is an app where the player can use 7 beatboxers to make a mix. Once they pick one from the available 9 versions (Alpha, Little Miss, Sunrise, The Love, Brazil, Alive, Jeevan, Dystopia, and Wekiddy), they are brought to an interface. This interface shows 20 available sound icons, divided into 4 categories: beat, effects, melodies and voices. Each icon is a unique acappella sound loop to drag and drop onto the polos. == References == Category:2009 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Browser games Category:Flash games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Music video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Windows games",
