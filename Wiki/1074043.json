 "text": "The Greek resistance (, meaning \"National Resistance\"), was the fight of armed and unarmed groups of many political views, against the Axis powers that had captured Greece in 1941 and their puppet state, the Hellenic State. It went from 1941 to 1944, during World War II. The largest group was the communist- influenced EAM-ELAS. The Greek Resistance is considered to have been one of the strongest resistance movements in Nazi-occupied Europe. Its partisans, were men and women known as andartes and andartisses (, meaning \"male rebels and female rebels\"). They controlled much of the countryside before the Germans left Greece in the end of 1944. == References == == Sources == * R. Capell, Simiomata: A Greek Note Book 1944–45, London 1946 * * * N.G.L.
