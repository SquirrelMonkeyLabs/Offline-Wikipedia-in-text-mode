Deliriants are similar to drugs like ketamine, but their primary effect is delirium, which is different than the effect by drugs like Ketamine. Deliriants are usually anticholinergic drugs including first-generation antihistamines, including promethazine, doxylamine and diphenhydramine. These drugs in sufficient amounts often cause people to see scary things like insects, spiders and shadow people. Category:Psychoactive drugs",
