 "text": "Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm IV (born March 10, 1982), better known by his online alias Dr Disrespect, is a American internet personality and livestreamer. He is a YouTube streamer. He is known for streaming game in the battle royal genre like H1Z1, Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone, and PUBG: Battlegrounds. Beahm is known for playing a character called Dr Disrespect. He wears a wig in a mullet style, with sunglasses, headphones, and a red bulletproof vest. His fans are known as the \"Champions Club\". He has been sponsored by and collaborated with many well known brands like Gillette, Asus, Turtle Beach, and the San Francisco 49ers. During his career, Beahm has gained a lot of controversy. On June 11, 2019, he was suspended from Twitch after he ended up streaming in the bathroom twice during the 2019 E3. He would later be unbanned on June 25. In March 2020, Beahm would sign a multi-year contract with Twitch but would be permanently banned from the platform on June 26 for reasons that were not made public at the time. In August 2021, he said that he was suing Twitch. The lawsuit was settled in March 2022. On June 21, 2024, it was tweeted by a former Twitch director of strategic partnerships that Beahm was banned because he allegedly used Twitch's Whisper feature to sext a minor and tried to meet up with her at TwitchCon. Beahm would respond to this by stating that \"no wrongdoing was acknowledged\" and that the lawsuit was settled. On June 25, Beahm made a statement on the matter, admitting that he had sent private messages to a minor that he said \"sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate\". He would replace the word \"minor\" with \"individual\" before adding it back. A former Twitch employee stated that Beahm's statement was false and that the texts were \"graphic\". After the news broke, many sponsors dropped Beahm, he was fired from his gaming studio Midnight Society, and YouTube both demonetized and suspended him from their partner program. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:American video game designers Category:American YouTubers Category:People from San Diego County, California Category:Twitch (service) streamers",
