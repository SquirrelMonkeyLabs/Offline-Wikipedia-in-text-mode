An anime television series was released in 2014 and 2015 and a live-action movie was released in 2016. ==Plot== Kōsei Arima is a piano prodigy. He won many music competitions when he was young and became famous because of this. His mother was a cruel piano teacher. She died and Kōsei had a mental breakdown while playing the piano. Because of this, he can't hear the sound of his piano even though his hearing is fine. After two years, Kōsei has not played the piano and he sees the world in monochrome. He keeps living his life with his friends Tsubaki and Watari. He meets Kaori Miyazono, a fourteen-year-old violinist that plays very freely. Kaori helps Kōsei play music again. Kōsei knows that he loves her, but she already likes Watari. Kaori forces Kōsei to do a performance with her,but she suddenly collapses after the performance and was sent to the hospital. She tells Kōsei that she is anemic but this is a lie. She had collapsed many times before when she was younger. When Kaori comes back from the hospital, she invites Kōsei to play at a Gala with her. Kaori doesn't show up on the day of the Gala. As her health gets worse, she begins to give up on life and wants to kill herself. Kousei helps her keep going by playing a duet with Nagi Aiza, the sister of a fellow rival of his. After this, Kaori chooses to have a dangerous surgery that will kill her if it fails, just so that she can play with him one more time. Kaori dies because of the surgery. Kōsei gets a letter from Kaori that is given to him by her parents at her funeral. The letter says that she was in love with Kōsei the whole time, and she lied that she liked Watari. She did this to get closer to him while not hurting Tsubaki's (who also has a crush on Kōsei) feelings. ==Characters== ; : & Piano performance by: Tomoki Sakata :Kōsei is a child prodigy in playing the piano.
