 "text": "Wilson Frost (December 27, 1925 â€“ May 5, 2018) was an American politician. He served as Chicago alderman of the 34th Ward. In 1976, upon the death of longtime mayor Richard J. Daley, Frost declared that he was acting mayor. In a power struggle that lasted several days, the entirely Democratic Chicago City Council determined that Frost was incorrect in his claim, and appointed Alderman Michael Anthony Bilandic as acting mayor instead. If he had been elected mayor, Wilson Frost would have been Chicago's first African American mayor. He was born in Cairo, Illinois. Frost died on May 5, 2018 in Palm Desert, California at the age of 92. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Lawyers from Chicago Category:Chicago City Council members Category:Democratic Party (United States) politicians",
