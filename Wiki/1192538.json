 "text": "The Royal Mews is a mews, or collection of equestrian stables, of the British royal family. The first Royal Mews were located at Charing Cross, at the western end of The Strand. Royal eagles were kept there starting in 1377. The name \"Mews\" comes from the word \"mew,\" which means to shed feathers, as the birds were kept there until they molted. The building burned down in 1534 and was rebuilt as stables, but it kept its old name. On old maps, the Royal Mews can be seen extending towards the current Leicester Square. This building was generally known as \"King's Mews,\" but sometimes also called \"Royal Mews\" or \"Queen's Mews\" if a queen was on the throne. It was rebuilt in 1732 based on designs by William Kent.Stewart-Wilson, Mary (1991). The Royal Mews. London: The Bodley Head. p. 187. By the early 19th century, it was open to the public. It was an impressive classical building with a large open space, making it one of the biggest structures in central London at a time when royal parks were on the city's edge and Sloane Square gardens were only for residents. == References == Category:Museums in England",
