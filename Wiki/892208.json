 "text": "Cyclobutane is a cycloalkane organic compound with the formula (CH2)4, a colorless gas at room temperature. Cyclobutane is usually sold as a liquified gas (a gas that has been pressurized or frozen to be in a state that isn't natural). Variants of cyclobutane are called cyclobutanes. Cyclobutane has no uses in commerce or biology, but compounds containing cyclobutane are important in biology and biotechnology. == Structure == The carbon atoms within cyclobutane are at odd angles. Cyclobutane is unstable and will break at temperatures over about 500Â° celcius. Cyclobutane is connected to itself in a ladder-like structure. An example of this structure can be seen in in pentacycloanammoxic acid. This compound is a ladderane made up of five connected cyclobutane units. == References == 4",
