 "text": "Very high frequency (VHF) is an ITU label of radio frequencies.\"Rec. ITU-R V.431-7, Nomenclature of the frequency and wavelength bands used in telecommunications\" The designation has all frequencies between 30 megahertz to 300 megahertz. Behind the VHF frequencies is called high frequency (HF). Above the VHF frequencies is called ultra high frequency (UHF). In many parts of the world, VHF Band I was used for the broadcasting of analog television. Because of the worldwide switch to digital terrestrial television most countries ask that television in the VHF range uses digital encoding, rather than analog encoding. == Global use == Some parts of the VHF band have the same use globally. Some national uses are detailed below. * 50-54 MHz: Amateur Radio 6-meter band. * 108-118 MHz: Air naviation beacons VOR and Instrument Landing System limiter. * 118-137 MHz: Airband used by air traffic control, AM. 121.5 MHz is an emergency frequency. * 144-146 MHz: Amateur Radio 2-meter band (Goes up to 148 MHz in some regions) * 156-174 MHz: VHF maritime mobile band for maritime two-way radio on ships. == References == Category:Electromagnetic radiation Category:Wave physics",
