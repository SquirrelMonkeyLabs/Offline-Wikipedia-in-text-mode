With Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka, he was among the most important artists of Wiener Moderne. The most important collection of Schiele's work is in the Leopold Museum in Vienna. Schiele died of influenza, at only 28 years old of the pandemic known as Spanish flu, which killed between 20 and 100 million people. == Images == File:Egon Schiele 020.jpg|Woman with green stockings (Frau mit den grünen Stümpfen), 1908 File:Egon Schiele 077.jpg|Self-portrait clothed in black (Selbstporträt mit dem schwarzen Gewand),1910 File:Egon Schiele 074.jpg|Self-portrait (Selbstportät), 1912 File:Egon Schiele 043.jpg|Woman, lying down (Liegende Frau), 1917 File:Egon Schiele 094.jpg|Four trees (Vier Bäume), 1917 File:Egon Schiele 088.jpg|Stein an der Donau II, 1913 File:Egon Schiele 013.jpg|The Bridge (Die Brücke), 1913 File:Egon Schiele 004.jpg|Old Mill (Alte Mühle), 1916 File:Egon Schiele 078.jpg|Self-portrait (Selbstportät) File:Egon Schiele 061.jpg|Portrait Eduard Kosmack, 1910 Category:Austrian painters Category:Deaths from influenza Category:1890 births Category:1918 deaths",
