 "text": "RONA inc. is a Canadian chain of home improvement stores. They are headquartered in Boucherville, Quebec. They have around 425 store locations all across Canada and one in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, France. They sell product such as home improvement tools and materials for construction. In September 1939, the company was created by a group of independent hardware retailers in the Montreal-area under the name \"Les Marchands en Quincaillerie\" (The Merchants of Hardware). Les Marchands en Quincaillerie founders Roland Dansereau and Napoleon Piotte officially named the company Ro-Na after the syllables of their first names. It was later shortened and they dropped the hyphen. In 2007, RONA purchased the Burnaby, British Columbia-based company Dick's Lumber. On February 3, 2016, it was announced that U.S. hardware company Lowe's had purchased Rona for $3.2 billion. After the purchase, Rona had to remove their \"Truly Canadian\" and \"Proudly Canadian\" signs after a complaint from Advertising Standards Canada that it was misleading. In November 2022, Rona was sold by Lowe's to Sycamore Partners. In July 2023, Rona decided to create the Rona+ banner and began to phase out their Lowe's branding. == References == ==Other website== * Category:1930s establishments in Canada Category:1939 establishments Category:Companies based in Quebec Category:Hardware stores of Canada",
