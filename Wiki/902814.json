 "text": "The Donald J. Trump Presidential Library is the presidential library of Donald Trump, 45th and 47th president of the United States. A website hosted by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) was created on January 20, 2021, which was Trump's last day as the 45th president. It is the 15th NARA- managed presidential library. Plans to build a library and museum are not yet known. Like other presidential libraries, a building for Trump would need to be privately financed and organized before the possible involvement of the NARA. During Trump's presidency, it had been rumored that floors in Trump Tower may be dedicated for use to a future presidential library. The Washington Post reported that Trump wanted his library to be built in Florida. In March 2025, it was reported that members of Trump's team were looking for universities in Florida, namely Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Florida International University (FIU), for a potential presidential library. ==References== Category:Donald Trump Category:Presidential libraries",
