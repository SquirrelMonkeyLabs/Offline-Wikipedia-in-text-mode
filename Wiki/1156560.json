 "text": "Kingbury's rocket frog (Allobates kingsburyi) is a frog. It lives in Ecuador. ==Body== The adult male frog is 16.3–20.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 18.8–22.2 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color with a cream-colored line down each side of the body. The sides of the body are black in color and the eardrum is brown. There is a cream- yellow line on each side of the body from the eye to the mouth. The tops of the front legs are brown in color with small lines. The tops of the back legs are brown in color with darker marks. The male frog has dark marks on the belly and the female frog does not have these marks. The iris of the eye is black in color with some gold. Frogs that are not adults yet have wider stripes than adults do. ==Name== G.A. Boulenger named this frog after an assistant who was killed in Palestine in 1918. ==Home== This frog lives on the dead leaves on the ground in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that were destroyed and are growing back. Scientists saw the frog from meters above sea level. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Parque Nacional Sangay, Parque Nacional Podocarpus, Parque Nacional Llanganates, and Parque Nacional Cayambe Coca. ==Young== Scientists think the female frog lays her eggs on the ground and that the male frogs carry the tadpoles to streams after the eggs hatch. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. They think the frogs might even all be dead now. People do change the places where the frog lives to make farms, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to get wood to build with. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
