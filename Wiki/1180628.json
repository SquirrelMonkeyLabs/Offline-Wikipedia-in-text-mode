 "text": "A consolidated city-county is a small subdivision in the United States. It forms when a city and a county become one political area. Then it will have one government, with the ruling powers of both a city and a county. Sometimes, a consolidated city-county also has other cities and towns inside it. These cities and towns are also incorporated (having their own government). An example is Jefferson County, Kentucky, which combined with Louisville, Kentucky, but also has some smaller cities. == Related pages == * Independent city (United States) == References == Category:Counties of the United States Category:Local government in the United States",
