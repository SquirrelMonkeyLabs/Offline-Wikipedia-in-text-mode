 "text": "Chile is divided into 15 regions (in Spanish, regiones; singular región), which are the first-level administrative division in the country. Each region is ruled by an intendant (intendente), designated by the President, and a body elected indirectly known as regional board (consejo regional). Regions are divided into provinces (second-level administrative division), each of them ruled by a governor (gobernador), designated by the President too. There are 54 provinces, in total. Provinces are further divided into communes or comunas (third and lowest level administrative division), which are governed by municipalities. == List of regions == Code Region Capital Provinces Comunas Area (km²) Population (2015) XV Arica and Parinacota Arica 2 4 16,873.3 239,126 I Tarapacá Iquique 2 7 42,225.8 336,769 II Antofagasta Antofagasta 3 9 126,049.1 622,640 III Atacama Copiapó 3 9 75,176.2 312,486 IV Coquimbo La Serena 3 15 40,579.9 77,1085 V Valparaíso Valparaíso 8 38 16396.1 1,825,757 RM Santiago Santiago 6 52 15,403.2 7,314,176 VI O'Higgins Rancagua 3 33 16,387.0 918,751 VII Maule Talca 4 30 30,296.1 1,042,989 VIII Bío Bío Concepción 4 54 37,068.7 2,114,286 IX Araucanía Temuco 2 32 31,842.3 989,798 XIV Los Ríos Valdivia 2 12 18,429.5 404,432 X Los Lagos Puerto Montt 4 30 48,583.6 841,123 XI Aysén Coihaique 4 10 108,494.4 108,328 XII Magallanes Punta Arenas 4 11 132,297.2 164,661 Regions",
