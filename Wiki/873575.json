 "text": "The orange-spotted leaf frog (Callimedusa perinesos) is a frog that lives in Ecuador and Colombia. Scientists have seen it up in the mountains, between 1410 and 1740 meters above sea level. The pupils of this frog's eyes are vertical: they go up and down and open side to side. This frog's Latin name comes from the purple color on its skin. It is mostly green in color, with white spots on its sides. The adult male frog is to cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is to long. When it is time to lay eggs, the female frog lays 52 to 62 eggs at a time on a leaf and then folds the leaf around the eggs. She puts jelly on the eggs to hold the nest together and to stop the eggs from drying out. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
