 "text": "Liemers or De Liemers (historically also known as Lijmers) is a region in the province of Gelderland, the Netherlands. It lies in the very east of the country, near Germany. It is bordered by three rivers, namely southwest the Rhine, northwest the IJssel, northeast the Oude IJssel, and the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia in the southeast. The northern and especially the eastern boundaries are rather vague. There is a grey area with the Achterhoek region, which stretches itself from these borders of the Liemers region. The hills of Montferland or Bergherbos in the municipality of Montferland are also considered as the eastern border. The local dialect is called Liemers, which belongs to the Low Franconian languages. == Municipalities == These ten municipalities lie more or less in the Liemers region: * Bronckhorst (a small part in the southwest) * Doesburg (the southern part) * Doetinchem (the western part) * Duiven * Montferland * Oude IJsselstreek (the western part) * Westervoort * Zevenaar == References == * Plaatsengids.nl Category:Regions of the Netherlands",
