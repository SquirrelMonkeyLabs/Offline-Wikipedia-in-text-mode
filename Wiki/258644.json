 "text": "\"Dig a Pony\" is a song by The Beatles. ==Composition== John Lennon was the song's composer and singer but the song was credited to Lennon/McCartney. It was originally called \"All I Want Is You\". Lennon would later comment that he thought the song was \"a piece of garbage,\" though he has shown similar scorn for many of his songs. It was written for his soon-to-be wife Yoko Ono, and featured a multitude of strange, seemingly nonsense phrases which were strung together, culminating in the chorus \"All I want is you\", aimed at Yoko. The song was one of the songs on Let It Be that was recorded at the rooftop concert. It begins with a false start, with Ringo Starr yelling \"hold it!\" to halt the other band members because he was holding a cigarette and had only one drum stick in his hand. ==Personnel== *John Lennon – lead vocal, rhythm guitar *Paul McCartney – backing vocal, bass *George Harrison – backing vocal, lead guitar *Ringo Starr – drums ==Notes== Category:The Beatles songs Category:1970 songs",
