It was formed by the union of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) with the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA) in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, in May 1958. In 1983, the vote was finally held regarding the merger, with a unanimous 151 presbyteries in the UPCUSA affirming it, and the PCUS affirming it 53 to 8. On June 10, 1983, the first General Assembly was held for the new denomination, which would be called the Presbyterian Church (USA). ==References== Category:1958 establishments in the United States Category:1983 disestablishments in the United States Category:Christian organizations based in the United States Category:Presbyterianism",
