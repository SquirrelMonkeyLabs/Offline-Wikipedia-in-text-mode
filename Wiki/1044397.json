 "text": "\"1944\" is a 2016 song by Ukrainian singer Jamala. She sings in English and Crimean Tatar. The song represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. It won with 534 points. == Topic == \"1944\" is about the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in the 1940s. Singer Jamala's great-grandmother was deported during that time. Jamala's great-grandfather was a soldier in World War II. That is why he could not protect his family. The song also deals with the renewed repression of Crimean Tatars. Most Crimean Tatars do not accept the annexation. The Crimean Tatar chorus is about not being allowed to live in your homeland. It therefore deals with the deportation of Jamala's great- grandmother. == At the Eurovision Song Contest == The song won the contest with 534 points. That was a new record back then. The previous record was set by Alexander Rybak in 2009 with 387 points. \"1944\" received 211 points from the official juries. The other 323 points came from the public televoting. == References == Category:2016 songs Category:Crimea Category:Eurovision Song Contest winning songs Category:Songs about war Category:Ukrainian songs",
