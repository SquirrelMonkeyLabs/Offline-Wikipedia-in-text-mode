 "text": "The 1908 Republican National Convention was held in Chicago Coliseum, Chicago, Illinois from June 16 to June 19, 1908. It nominated presidents that were in the Republican party. Theodore Roosevelt liked William Howard Taft, so he was nominated. The convention nominated James S. Sherman to be the vice president. == Candidates for president == Before the convention, Charles Fairbanks and Charles Evans Hughes both seemed like possible nominees, but Roosevelt chose to pick the president himself. Roosevelt wanted Elihu Root to be president, but Root was too young, so Roosevelt chose William Howard Taft instead. Taft was sure that he would win. Taft won the presidential nomination on the first ballot.
