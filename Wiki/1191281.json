 "text": "(.)p(...)nin was a Nubian king who ruled at the beginning of the fourth century AD. His name is only partially preserved and cannot currently be reconstructed. (.)p(...)nin is known only from an offering tablet with a Meroitic inscription found in the tomb Beg W384 in Meroe. This offering tablet is stylistically dated very late (around 300). The inscription, and thus the ruler's name, are heavily mutilated. It is not certain whether the tablet was stolen or whether Beg W384 is the ruler's tomb. His parents are also named on the offering tablet (father: Armli). == Literature == * * Category:Male Category:King (Nubia) Category:Kushites Category:Rulers (4th century) Category:Born in the 3rd or 4th century Category:Died in the 4th century",
