Many people will recognize him from Disneyâ€™s film Fantasia in which he conducts the orchestra and is seen shaking hands with Mickey Mouse. Stokowski had a long conducting career which started in 1909. He appeared in public for the last time in 2005 but continued making recordings until September 2007, a few months before his death at the age of 125. ==References== Category:1882 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American conductors Category:British conductors",
