 "text": "A programming block is the arrangement of television and radio programs so that similar types of programs will air in succession. TV channels and radio stations tend to do this with the hope that it will keep viewers interested and stay tuned to the station for a longer period of time rather than leave after just one show. This is quite popular in cable TV, where they can arrange reruns into blocks to fill daytime slots where there arenâ€™t so many viewers watching. Some blocks have become so popular that they ended up getting their own channel. Category:Broadcasting",
