He was Premier for the shortest time in Western Australian history. This was because he was a member of the upper house of Parliament and it was usual for the Premier to be from the lower house. When he could not find a position in the lower house he resigned. ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1953 deaths Colebatch, Hal Category:People from Herefordshire Category:Nationalist Party of Australia politicians Category:Members of the Australian Senate",
