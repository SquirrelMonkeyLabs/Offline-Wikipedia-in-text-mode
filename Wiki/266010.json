 "text": "Barium chlorate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ba(ClO3)2. It contains barium and chlorate ions. ==Properties== Barium chlorate is a colorless solid. It is very toxic because it has barium ions in it. It also is an oxidizing agent. It makes oxygen gas when it is heated. ==Preparation== Barium chlorate can be made by reacting sodium chlorate and barium chloride. It can also be made by electrolytic oxidation of barium chloride, similar to the chloralkali process. It can also be made by reacting ammonium chlorate, an unstable compound, with barium carbonate. This mixture is boiled, converting the ammonium carbonate to ammonia and carbon dioxide. ==Uses== Barium chlorate is used in fireworks to make a green color. It is also used in matches to make oxygen and make the match burn faster. ==Related pages== *Barium nitrate Category:Chlorine compounds Category:Barium compounds",
