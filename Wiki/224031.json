 "text": "In entomology, the imago is the last stage in the development of an insect. In an incomplete metamorphosis it comes after the last ecdysis.Sloughing off of epicuticle or exoskeleton during larval growth. If the metamorphosis is complete, it comes after emergence from the pupa. This is the only stage where the insect is sexually mature and (if a winged species) has functional wings. The imago is often referred to as the adult stage. == References == Category:Insects",
