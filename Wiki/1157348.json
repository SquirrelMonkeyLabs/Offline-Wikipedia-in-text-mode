 "text": "The Oz series is a series of children’s books by L. Frank Baum. Baum wrote fourteen Oz books. Baum said he wrote them because he wanted there to be fairy tales which weren’t scary. His first book was The Wonderful Wizard of Oz which he wrote in 1900. After Baum's death in 1919, publisher Reilly & Lee made annual Oz books, In 1921, Royal Historian Ruth Plumly Thompson wrote nineteen Oz books. After Thompson, Reilly & Lee made seven more books in the series: three by John R. Neill, two by Jack Snow, one by Rachel R.C. Payes, and a final book by Eloise Jarvis McGraw and Lauren Lynn McGraw. The forty books in Reilly & Lee's Oz series are called \"the Famous Forty\" by fans, and are considered the canonical Oz texts. ==Books by L. Frank Baum== ===Oz books=== The original Oz books by L.

These books, together with Baum's original fourteen novels, form the \"Famous Forty\", and are considered the canonical books of the series. Ruth Plumly Thompson's style was markedly different from Baum's. Her tales harked back to more traditional fairy tales. She often included a small kingdom, with a prince or princess who saves his or her kingdom and regains the throne or saves Oz from invasion. ===Books by Ruth Plumly Thompson=== By Ruth Plumly Thompson Order Title Illustrator Year Publisher 15 The Royal Book of Oz John R.

Neill=== Illustrator John R. Neill's vision of Oz is more manic than Thompson or Baum's. Houses often get up and do battle, and everything can be alive.

Frank Baum. ===Books by Gregory Maguire=== Title Year Notes Wicked 1995 It is a parallel novel written by Maguire and illustrated by Douglas Smith. Based upon the writings of L. Frank Baum, it is a revisionist look at the land and characters of Oz, drawing primarily from Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The novel presents events, characters and situations from Baum's books and the film in new ways, with several differences between the L. Frank Baum series and the Wicked Cycle. These differences arise from the original Oz functioning as a mirror-image of Kansas in a cultural and economic framework: Oz was wealthy, prosperous and had excellent agricultural yields while Kansas was characterized by economic hardship, environmental difficulties and poor harvests. The social strife described in The Wicked Years indicates that the two series are set in similar and internally consistent but distinctly separate visions of Oz. The novel focuses on the life of the Wicked Witch of the West, whom Maguire gives the name Elphaba. Unlike the popular 1939 movie and Baum's writings, this novel is not directed at children, and contains adult language and content. It is the basis for the Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman, which was adapted into a two-part musical film directed by Jon M. Chu. Son of a Witch 2005 A sequel to Wicked, focusing on Elphaba's son Liir. A Lion Among Men 2008 The third book in \"The Wicked Years\", telling the life story of the Cowardly Lion (given the name \"Brrr\" by Maguire). Out of Oz 2011 The fourth and final volume in \"The Wicked Years\", focusing on the life of Rain, daughter of Liir and granddaughter of Elphaba. The story also includes Dorothy's return to Oz (and trial for the deaths of the Wicked Witches of the East and West), as well as the appearance of Tip and Mombi (here spelled \"Mombey\") from The Marvelous Land of Oz. Tales Told in Oz 2012 A collection of five short stories exploring the folklore of Oz in \"The Wicked Years.\" The Brides of Maracoor 2021 The first volume in the series \"Another Day\", set after \"The Wicked Years\" and centered on Rain, Elphaba's granddaughter. The Oracle of Maracoor 2022 The second volume of \"Another Day\". The Witch of Maracoor 2023 The third and final volume of \"Another Day\". Elphie: A Wicked Childhood 2025 An upcoming prequel to \"The Wicked Years.\" ===Books by Alexander Volkov=== Alexander Volkov was a Russian novelist who published his own series of Oz novels called the Magic Land books, for readers in Soviet Russia, China and East Germany. His first book, published in 1939, was a translation and adaptation of Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but the further books that he wrote in the 1960s and 70s were entirely Volkov's invention. Title Year Notes The Wizard of the Emerald City 1939, 1959 Volkov's original adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Ellie, 9, and her puppy Totoshka are carried in a hurricane to the Magic Land. After the first shock of the beauty of the land and Totoshka's sudden gift of wise speech, they meet the Fairy of the Yellow Land, Villina, who tells them that she has allowed their house to be taken by the wind to land on the head of Gingema, the Wicked Witch of the Blue Land, and kill her. Now Ellie is called \"The Fairy of the Killing House\" and is worshipped by the people around. Villina tells Ellie to follow the Yellow Brick Road to find Goodwin, the Great and the Horrible, the ruler of the Magic Land, who lives in the Emerald City. He is supposed to bring Ellie back home to her parents if she fulfills the greatest wishes of three creatures that she will meet on the way. They set off, Ellie wearing the silver shoes that Totoshka has found in Gingema's house. They meet Strashila the scarecrow, who dreams of having a brain, The Iron Woodman, who dreams of a heart, and the Cowardly Lion, who dreams about courage. This novel is nearly the same as the original, with a few changes and additions. Urfin Dzhus and His Wooden Soldiers 1963 The first of Volkov's sequels, all of which have nearly nothing to do with Baum's. In this one, set one year after the events in the first novel, Urfin Dzhus, a former servant of Gingema, discovers a magical powder that brings things to life. He then creates an army of wooden soldiers and sets off to conquer the Magic Land. On her farm in Kansas, Ellie meets a crow bearing a pictured message: Strashila and The Iron Woodman behind bars. Ellie (with Totoshka) and her uncle, the wooden-legged seaman Charlie Black, set off through the desert and the mountains to help their friends. Seven Kings of the Underground 1964 Trapped in a huge cave after a collapse, Ellie, now 11, Totoshka and Ellie's cousin Fred (13) are forced to move further into the cave. They end up in the underground of the Magic Land, in the Land of the Seven Kings of the Underground, which is currently caught up in a serious political crisis. The people recognize Ellie as the Fairy of the Killing House and keep her hostage, forcing her to use her magical powers to restore the Magical Spring of Sleepy Water that keeps the order in the country. It is up to Fred now to find a way out to seek help from Ellie's friends. The Fiery God of the Marrans 1968 Urfin Dzhus deceives the backward marrans (jumpers), who until then did not know how to control fire, with the help of the injured eagle Karfax, whom he nursed back to health, and the lighter of the one-legged sailor Charlie Black. He persuaded them to wage war against the winkers and the Emerald City. With the help of Ellie's sister Ann, her boyfriend Tim O'Kelli, Arthur, a grandson of the dog Toto and two mechanical ponies and a grandiose volleyball game, the heroes succeed in defeating Urfin this time as well. The Yellow Fog 1970 A giant witch named Arachna wakes up after a 5,000 years' sleep. She wishes to rule the Magic Land, but seeing that the people would not surrender, sends on them an eerie Yellow Fog that threatens to bring eternal winter and poison all the people, eventually causing mass death and destruction. The people of the Magic Land Once seal rooms to hide inside and use the leaves of a certain tree as gas masks, but this cannot last forever. Annie, Ellie's younger sister (8), her friend Tim (9), and Artoshka, Totoshka's grandson, accompanied by Charlie Black, rush to the rescue. Charlie builds a giant piloted robot who defeats the witch. The Secret of the Abandoned Castle 1976, 1982 This time the people of the Magic Land have to deal with an alien invasion. The inseparable Annie and Tim, now 12 and 13, along with Fred the engineer, arrive to help their friends. They discover that the aliens are not united: some of them, the Arzaks, are enslaved to the Menvits through their hypnotic eyes. The guests from the Outer World discover that the Magic Land may hold the key to the Arzaks' freedom. ===Books by the Baum family=== Title Writer Year Notes The Laughing Dragon of Oz Frank Joslyn Baum 1934 A \"Big Little Book\" written by Baum's eldest son (credited as \"Frank Baum\") and published by Whitman Publishing.

All subsequent novels by Baum are solely products of his imagination. Return to Oz Joan D.
