 "text": "The United States Marine Corps (also known as USMC) is one of the six branches of the military of the United States in the United States Department of Defense. It was created in 1775 as a special maritime service. Although it is part of the United States Navy, it is a separate military branch with its own special ranking structure. It also has its own Naval Aviation. The Marines have been involved in many conflicts, and had important roles in key battles such as Tripoli, Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal, and Inchon Bay. Every Marine receives infantry training to be ready for battle at all times. Marine Corps training is also known for being especially challenging; at 13 weeks long, it is the longest basic training of the six military branches. The Marines place a large emphasis on morale, as is reflected in their motto, semper fidelis (meaning \"always faithful\"), often shortened to semper fi. Samuel Nicholas founded the Marine Corps and was its first commissioned officer. The birthplace of the Marines is in Philadelphia, at the Tun Tavern. == Related pages == *A ship named after a Marine killed at Guadalcanal == Other websites == * United States Marine Corps -Citizendium Category:1775 establishments in the Thirteen Colonies",
