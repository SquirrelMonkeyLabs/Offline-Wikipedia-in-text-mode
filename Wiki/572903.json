 "text": "Non-separable wavelets are multi-dimensional wavelets that are not implemented using one-dimensional operations. They have been studied since 1992. In contrast to separable wavelets, the non-separable wavelets have several advantages. The non-separable filters imply more parameters in design. This consequently leads to better filters. == Examples == * Red-black waveletsG. Uytterhoeven and A.
