 "text": "Québec debout (Translation: Quebec Standing Up, or Quebec Stand Up), formerly the Groupe parlementaire québécois (Translation: Quebec Parliamentary Group) is a Quebec-based parliamentary group in the House of Commons of Canada that is in the process of registering as a political party. The group does not have a party leader but named Rhéal Fortin as its spokesperson on March 21, 2018. The Groupe parlementaire québécois was formed on February 28, 2018 by seven Members of Parliament (MPs) who resigned from the caucus of the Bloc Québécois (BQ) due to their opposition to the leadership of Martine Ouellet. In September 2018, Rheal Fortin and the rest of Quebec Debout rejoined the Bloc Quebecois. ==References== Category:2018 establishments in Canada Category:Political parties of Quebec",
