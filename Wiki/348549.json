 "text": "A roar is a sound that is made from certain animals. This sound is a deep outburst from an open mouth. Roaring is made by using the hyoid. The hyoid is a small bone that is not completely rigid in adults. Animals roar for a few reasons. These include when animals claim their territory (such as territorial dispute), communication with other members, and when they are angry. == Other websites == * Ananthakrishnan, Gopal, Robert Eklund, Gustav Peters, Gopal & Evans Mabiza. 2011.
