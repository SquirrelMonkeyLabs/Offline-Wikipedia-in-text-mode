It was designed in approximately 2013 by Canadian linguist Sonja Lang, the creator of the language. == History == sitelen pona was designed by Sonja Lang to get ready for the release of her Toki Pona textbook. In 2013, she published a page listing 20 symbols as a sample of what would be in the book. (Date retrieved from PDF metadata). The book, called Toki Pona: The Language of Good, was published in 2014, and it has the first complete explanation of sitelen pona in a certain section. In 2024, Lang published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Toki Pona edition), the first book in the su series of pictured storybooks for beginners. The whole book is written in Toki Pona using the sitelen pona writing system. This was the first book to be published that used sitelen pona as a main writing system. In 2025, about twenty members of the Toki Pona community, including Lang created the Sitelen Pona Publishers and Typographers Association, wanting to represent the interests of publishers and fontmakers who use the writing system, and in collaboration with other groups such as the Unicode Consortium to help standardize the writing system in a detailed way. == References == Category:Writing systems",
