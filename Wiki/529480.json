 "text": "Elections are held in Azerbaijan to elect the head of state (the president) and a legislature (the parliament). The President of Azerbaijan is elected for a five-year term by the people; before a referendum by the people changed this in 2009, the position was limited to two terms. The parliament of Azerbaijan, the National Assembly (Milli Məclis), has 125 members. Before 2005, 100 members were elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies and 25 members were elected by proportional representation. Since 2005 all 125 members are elected in single-seat constituencies. Azerbaijan is a one party dominant state. Opposition political parties beside the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. On Sunday, 1 November 2015, the most recent parliamentary elections were held. On Wednesday, 9 October 2013, the most recent presidential election was held. ==Latest elections== ===2013 Presidential election=== ===2015 Parliamentary election=== !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/– |- |align=left|New Azerbaijan Party||1,340,770||47.20||69||–2 |- |align=left|Whole Azerbaijan Popular Front Party||42,459||1.49||1||0 |- |align=left|Civic Solidarity Party||37,561||1.32||2||–1 |- |align=left|Great Order Party||34,156||1.20||1||0 |- |align=left|Motherland Party||28,483||1.00||1||–1 |- |align=left|Musavat||24,995||0.88||0||0 |- |align=left|Azerbaijan Social Prosperity Party||22,003||0.77||1||0 |- |align=left|Party for Democratic Reforms||21,044||0.74||1||0 |- |align=left|Unity Party||15,070||0.53||1||+1 |- |align=left|Party of Hope||14,815||0.52||0||–1 |- |align=left|Civic Unity Party||13,548||0.48||1||0 |- |align=left|Azerbaijan Democratic Enlightenment Party||13,279||0.47 ||1||+1 |- |align=left|National Revival Movement Party||12,043||0.42||1||New |- |align=left|Classic Popular Front Party||11,671||0.41||0||0 |- |align=left|Azerbaijan Communist Party||11,426||0.40||0||0 |- |align=left|Social Democratic Party||11,288||0.40||1||+1 |- |align=left|Azerbaijan National Independence Party||10,526||0.37||0||0 |- |align=left|Justice Party||6,507||0.23||0||–1 |- |align=left|Azerbaijan People's Party||6,152||0.22||0||0 |- |align=left|Citizen and Development Party||3,374||0.12||0||0 |- |align=left|Democratic Azerbaijan World Party||3,230||0.11||0||0 |- |align=left|Great Azerbaijan Party||2,807||0.10||0||0 |- |align=left|Azerbaijan Democratic Party||2,746||0.10||0||0 |- |align=left|AMDEP||481||0.02||0||New |- |align=left|Independents||1,150,413||40.50||43||–3 |- |align=left|Invalidated||–||–||1||– |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||33,696||–||–||– |- |align=left|Total||2,874,543||100||125||0 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout|| || ||–||– |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: MSK |} ===2009 Constitutional referendum=== ==Past elections== ===Presidential elections=== * Azerbaijani presidential election, 2018 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 2013 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 2008 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 2003 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 1998 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 1993 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 1992 * Azerbaijani presidential election, 1991 ===Parliamentary elections=== * Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2015 * Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010 * Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2005 * Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2000–2001 * Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 1995–1996 * Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 1990 ===Constitutional referendums=== * Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, 2009 * Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, 2002 * Azerbaijani constitutional referendum, 1995 ===Other referendums=== * Azerbaijani vote of confidence referendum, 1993 * Azerbaijani independence referendum, 1991 ==Related pages== * Voting * Voting system ==Other websites== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Azerbaijan – Parliamentary Elections, 2005 Azerbaijan Category:Politics of Azerbaijan Category:Political history of Azerbaijan Category:Modern history of Azerbaijan Category:Events in Azerbaijan",
