 "text": "The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ in the abdomen. It stores about 50 ml of acidic liquid (bile) until the body needs it for digestion. That liquid helps digest fat. The gallbladder is about 7-10cm long in humans. It is dark green in color because of the bile in it. It is connected to the liver and the duodenum by the biliary tract. The bile is later carried through the blood stream and into the Small intestine, where most of the nutrients is absorbed. Category:Anatomy of the digestive system",
