The Phoenicians were the first to establish a settlement in the region. The Romans founded the city of Malaca (modern-day Malaga) around 300 BC. During the Roman period, the region became a successful centre for trade, agriculture, and mining. The Romans built several towns and ports along the coast, including Cartama, Velez-Malaga, and Almuñecar. In the ninth century AD, the Moors invaded Spain and introduced Islam to the country. They dominated the Costa del Sol for centuries. They left a cultural legacy that can still be seen in some of the region's most prominent landmarks. The Moors established irrigation and agriculture systems in the area and introduced crops like olives, almonds, oranges, and lemons. In 1487, the Spanish monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, conquered the Costa del Sol and the rest of Andalusia. The Catholic monarchs encouraged the resettlement of the region by Christians, leading to the construction of many churches and monasteries. In the 20th century, the Costa del Sol became a desired tourist destination. The first luxury hotels were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, followed by a boom in the construction of holiday homes and apartments in the 1970s and 1980s.
