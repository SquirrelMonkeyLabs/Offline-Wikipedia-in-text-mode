 "text": "The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Eastern Conference. The Red Wings franchise has been a part of the NHL since 1926, making them one of the \"Original Six\" clubs. Originally named the Detroit Cougars, the team was renamed to the Detroit Falcons in 1930; in 1932, the team's name was changed to the Detroit Red Wings and has remained the same since. As of the conclusion of the 2014–15 NHL season, 897 players have played for the franchise; of them, 91 of them are goaltenders, while 806 are skaters. Since its creation, the team has had 36 captains, including Hall of Famers Sid Abel, Ted Lindsay and Red Kelly. Six players have had the honor of having their jersey number officially retired from play; one of them is Steve Yzerman, who played for the Red Wings from 1983 to 2006, and was the longest-serving captain in North American major league sports, with a tenure of 19 years. Yzerman led his team to three Stanley Cups and was the recipient of several awards, including the Lester B. Pearson Award and Lester Patrick Trophy for his outstanding play and contributions to the sport. Thirty-five other players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. As of the conclusion of the 2010–11 NHL season, the Red Wings have made the Stanley Cup playoffs for 20 consecutive seasons, the longest post-season streak for a single team in all of North American major professional sports. Gordie Howe holds the franchise records for the most points (with 1809) and for the most goals (with 786). Howe was a member of a Stanley Cup-winning team four times, all with the Red Wings. As of the conclusion of the 2010–11 season, 869 players have played for the franchise; of them, 89 of them are goaltenders, while 780 are skaters. == Key == Won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings General abbreviations Abbreviation Definition GP Games played HHOF Inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player SC Won the Stanley Cup with the team, followed by year(s) won Ret Uniform number retired by the team Goaltender statistical abbreviations Abbreviation Definition W Wins L Losses T Ties OTL Overtime loss SO Shutouts GAA Goals against average SV% Save percentage Skater statistical abbreviations Abbreviation Definition Pos Position G Goals A Assists P Points PIM Penalty minutes D Defenceman LW Left wing C Centre RW Right wing Statistics are complete to the end of the 2016–17 NHL season. == Goaltenders == Goaltenders who have played for the franchise Name Nationality Seasons GP W L T OTL SO GAA SV% GP W L SO GAA SV% Notes Regular-season Playoffs Canada 1946–1947 1952–1953 4.00 2.97 Canada 1960–1964 1965–1967 2.95 2.41 Canada 1990–1992 4.32 0.861 3.00 0.917 Canada 1929–1930 2.71 Canada 1959–1960 3.00 Canada 1939–1940 3.00 Canada 1971–1973 3.81 Canada 1963–1964 4.36 Canada 1988–1994 3.40 0.882 3.00 0.896 Canada 1990–1991 6.14 0.800 United States 2008–2009 2011–2012 2.71 0.902 1.000 Canada 1931–1932 2.12 1.50 HHOF – 1958 Canada 2016–2018 4.26 .867 Canada 1933–1934 2.75 Canada 1963–1970 2.93 2.74 Canada 1933–1934 1.52 2.12 Canada 1971–1972 3.15 Canada 1972–1974 3.86 Canada 1943–1945 3.13 3.40 Canada 1928–1931 2.14 3.50 Canada 1967–1971 1972–1974 2.94 3.20 Canada 1987–1988 5.52 0.839 Canada 1993–1994 2.62 0.899 4.94 0.791 Canada 1936–1937 1943–1944 4.00 4.00 SC: 1937 Canada 1990–1991 10.30 0.786 Canada 1965–1968 3.59 Canada 1953–1954 1.00 SC: 1954 Canada 1975–1978 3.47 HHOF – 1987 Canada 1980–1983 4.18 Canada 1973–1976 4.34 Canada 1970–1971 4.74 Canada 1963–1964 7.50 Sweden 2012–2015 2.67 0.904 2.72 0.917 Canada 1952–1953 1954–1957 2.12 2.85 HHOF – 1975 Canada 1986–1991 3.47 2.58 Czech Republic 2001–2002 2003–2004 2006–2008 2.13 0.911 1.91 0.919 HHOF – 2014 SC: 2002, 2008 Canada 1995–1999 2.37 0.909 0.00 SC: 1997, 1998 Canada 1983–1984 4.11 Canada 1926–1928 1.98 HHOF – 1972 United States 2005–2018 2.85 0.910 2.58 0.918 Canada 1993–1994 5.28 0.85 Canada 1980–1981 7.00 Canada 2002–2004 2.46 0.911 1.64 0.931 Canada 1985–1987 4.72 Canada 2002–2004 1.45 0.948 Canada 1999–2006 2.18 0.918 2.54 0.888 SC: 2002 Canada 1980–1982 2.64 Canada 1977–1978 3.37 4.25 Canada 1980–1981 4.32 Canada 1943–1950 2.75 2.30 HHOF – 1980 SC: 1950 Canada 2006–2007 2010–2012 2.62 0.905 Canada 1997–1999 2.22 0.916 3.08 0.864 United States 2010–2015 2.98 0.879 Canada 1975–1976 5.50 Canada 1947–1948 7.50 Canada 1973–1975 4.15 Canada 1970–1971 5.16 Canada 1981–1986 4.24 9.80 Canada 1991–1992 2.71 0.896 Canada 1983–1986 5.00 2.86 Canada 1939–1940 3.00 Canada 1940–1943 1946–1947 2.56 2.55 SC: 1943 Czech Republic 2012–2018 2.60 0.912 1.88 0.931 Canada 1993–2001 2006–2011 2.49 0.905 2.02 0.918 SC: 1997, 1998, 2008 Canada 1958–1959 3.00 Canada 1985–1986 4.50 Canada 1998–1999 1.96 0.918 3.27 0.905 Canada 1973–1977 5.39 Canada 1991–1994 3.29 0.870 3.28 0.867 Canada 1959–1960 1962–1963 3.12 Canada 1932–1935 2.20 2.00 Canada 1936–1937 1.41 SC: 1937 United States 1963–1964 4.00 Canada 1970–1971 1973–1981 1982–1983 3.69 4.00 Canada 1981–1982 4.19 Canada 1949–1955 1957–1964 1968–1969 2.44 2.41 HHOF – 1971 SC: 1952, 1954, 1955 Ret #

At the same time, the league began tracking overtime losses for goaltenders. * Save percentage did not become an official NHL statistic until the 1982–1983 season. Therefore, goaltenders who played before 1982 do not have official save percentages. * The seasons column lists the first year of the season of the player's first game and the last year of the season of the player's last game. For example, a player who played one game in the 2000–2001 season would be listed as playing with the team from 2000–2001, regardless of what calendar year the game occurred within.'' == References == ;General * * * * * * ;Specific * Category:Lists of National Hockey League players",
