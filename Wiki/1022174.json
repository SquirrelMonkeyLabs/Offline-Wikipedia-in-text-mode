He played in three matches for the Austria national football team from 1911 to 1913. ==Career== Hans Schwarz started his career at DBC Sturm Prague. Then he went to Karlsbader FC . His next stop was at Hamburger FC 1888. Because First Vienna FC had a striker problem they let Hans Schwarz play together with Martin Laessig as \"guest on engagement\" at the Hohe Warte in autumn 1910 .Leo Schidrowitz: Geschichte des Fußballsportes in Österreich, Wien 1951, S. 72. (German) Martin Laessig soon returned to Germany. Hans Schwarz was able to put his shooting power to the test in the ÖFV's first championship season in 1911/12. With 22 goals he was the top scorer in the league. The striker of the Vienna had quickly made a name for himself in Vienna. In the summer of 1912 he went to the title candidate WAF . This soon was a case for the sports courts. The player was banned until the end of the season. Illustriertes Österreichisches Sportblatt vom 22 February(S. 10) und 15 March 1913 (S. 8) So it happened that Hans Schwarz could not play a single championship game for an entire season and was only allowed to play again in 1913/14, now for the WAF. As the second best league scorer, he shot the WAF to the Austrian champions with 21 goals. WAF won the decisive championship game in the last round against Vienna thanks to a brace from Schwarz and his strike partner Adi Fischera 4:2. ==International== On 7 May 1911 he made his international debut for Austria in a 3-1 win over Hungary. He also played in the following 2-1 away win against Germany. His last match was also versus Hungary. ==Death== A few weeks after the match versus Vienna he was killed in Russia during World War I. ==References== Category:1891 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Austrian footballers Category:Players of the Austrian national football team Category:Association football forwards Category:Austrian football forwards Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga top scorers",
