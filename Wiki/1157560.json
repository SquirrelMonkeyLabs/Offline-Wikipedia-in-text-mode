 "text": "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a 1953 American musical comedy film directed by Howard Hawks, produced by Sol C. Siegel, and written by Charles Lederer. The film stars Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell and is based off of a 1925 novel by Anita Loos. The film's cinematography was done by Harry J. Wild; it was edited by Hugh S. Fowler; and the music was composed by Hoagy Carmichael, Jule Styne, Eliot Daniel, and Lionel Newman. In the film, Monroe performs the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" in a pink dress, both of which solidified her presence as an icon and went down in history as two of her defining factors. == Gallery == Category:1953 musical movies Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies directed by Howard Hawks Category:20th Century Fox movies Category:1950s English-language movies Category:American musical comedy movies Category:American buddy comedy movies Category:American sex comedy movies Category:Movies set on ships Category:American satirical movies Category:Female buddy movies Category:Feminist movies Category:American romantic comedy movies Category:1950s American musical movies Category:1953 romantic comedy movies Category:1950s American romance movies",
