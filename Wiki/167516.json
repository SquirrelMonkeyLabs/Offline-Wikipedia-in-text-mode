His wife Therese was buried in the same grave. Their son Karl Ulrich and his wife Helen (1911-1974), who was a pianist as well, were buried in the same tomb as Schnabel and his wife. So was their grandson Claude Alain Mottier (1972-2002), also a pianist, who was killed in a traffic accident. In 2006, the town of Schwyz declared the family grave a monument.
