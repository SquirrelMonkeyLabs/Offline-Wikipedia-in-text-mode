It lived alongside creatures like the more famous Dolichorhynchops. Its closest relative was Plesiosaurus from the Jurassic period. == Other animals at the time == When Styxosaurus existed, so did Tylosaurus, Elasmosaurus, Archelon, Hesperornis, Xiphactinus, and Megacephalosaurus. == Media == Styxosaurus has appeared in Jurassic World video games and the documentary film Sea Monsters: A Prehistoric Adventure.
