 "text": "The Chrysler 300 is a full-size car produced by Stellantis North America and its predecessor companies. It was offered as both a four-door sedan and a station wagon in its first generation (2005–2010) and continued as a sedan in subsequent generations (2011–2023). The model line shared components with vehicles from Daimler-Benz during its development. ==First generation (2005–2010)== The first generation of the Chrysler 300 was introduced as a modern interpretation of the 1955 Chrysler C-300 and officially launched as the 2005 model. It was built on the Chrysler LX platform and had ties to the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the Mercedes-Benz S-Class for its structural elements and certain components. The 300 was initially available in different trims, including the base model, Touring, Limited, and the higher-performance 300C, which featured a 5.7 L Hemi V8 engine. The SRT-8 variant, introduced in 2005, was the high-performance model, equipped with a 6.1 L Hemi V8 that delivered 425 horsepower. A station wagon version, known as the 300C Touring, was offered in markets outside North America, sharing its rear bodywork with the Dodge Magnum. Diesel engines were also available in some international markets, including Europe and Australia. ==Second generation (2011–2023)== The second generation of the Chrysler 300 debuted in 2011, maintaining the rear- wheel-drive layout and many foundational elements of the first generation. It featured a revised platform called the LD, an evolution of the LX. The engine lineup included the 3.6 L Pentastar V6 and the 5.7 L Hemi V8, while a 6.4 L Hemi V8 was available in the SRT model. The SRT-8, launched in 2011, could reach 0–60 mph in about 4 seconds and included performance features like Brembo brakes and sportier suspension tuning. The second-generation 300 was offered with all-wheel drive in some models and was available with both standard and luxury trims, including the 300C, 300S, and Touring. A diesel option was available in Europe and Australia. The 300 was marketed in Europe as the Lancia Thema until 2014. ==Markets== The Chrysler 300 was sold worldwide, the car was especially popular in North America, but it was also marketed in other regions, including Europe, where it was sold as Lancia Thema from 2011 to 2014, in the United Kingdom and Ireland it was sold as The Chrysler 300C, the car was also sold in Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. ==Discontinuation== In 2022, Stellantis confirmed that the Chrysler 300 sedan would be discontinued after the 2023 model year due to declining sales and the company’s strategy to prioritize electric vehicle development over fossil fuel-powered models. The 300 was set to be replaced by a Chrysler-badged all- electric vehicle, previewed by the Chrysler Airflow EV concept. Production officially ended on December 8, 2023, with the final unit being a Velvet Red 300C. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Chrysler automobiles",
