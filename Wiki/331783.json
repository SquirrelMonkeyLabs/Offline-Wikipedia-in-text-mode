 "text": "Disney XD is an American digital cable and satellite television network. It is owned by Disney and ABC. It started on the Internet in 2008 and began broadcasting as a television network in 2009. Disney XD mostly airs action- oriented children's animated television series, with some live-action programming and movies aimed at ages 6 to 11. Disney XD broadcasts programming that is created for the network. The original programming includes Zeke and Luther, Kickin' It, Pair of Kings and Lab Rats. The network broadcasts some of the more popular Disney Channel series. These series include The Suite Life of Zack & Cody, The Suite Life on Deck, Wizards of Waverly Place, Phineas and Ferb and So Random! They also broadcast programs that were shown on other networks. Many of these are based on characters from the Marvel Universe. Disney bought Marvel Comics in 2009. Because of this, more programs based on Marvel comics will be shown on Disney XD starting in April 2012. In May 31, 2015, Disney XD introduced a new logo worldwide. Begining in 2019, with the build up towards the launch of Disney+ and especially during its international expansion during 2021, several Disney XD channels worldwide have began to shut down, mostly in regions where Disney+ is already available. As of May 1, 2025, only 3 Disney XD channels remain active, with these being present in the following countries: United States, Canada and Poland, since the Dutch version was replaced by Disney Junior. ==Programming== Disney XD's schedule consists largely of animated and live-action programs aimed at pre-teens and young teenagers. Disney XD content is a mixture of former original series as well as programs inherited from sister network Disney Channel. In addition to full- length live-action and animated original series, the channel also debuts short series similar to those seen on Disney Channel during commercial breaks (such as Two More Eggs), which serve as filler for programs scheduled to end during the half-hour and last usually around one to three minutes. In addition, Disney XD airs original made-for-TV movies from Disney Channel and theatrically released feature films.
