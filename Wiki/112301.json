 "text": "The United States Secretary of the Treasury is the head of the United States Department of the Treasury. The Secretary is concerned with finance and monetary matters, and, until 2003, some issues of national security and defense. This position in the Federal Government of the United States is similar to the finance ministers of other nations. From the U.S. Department of the Treasury website : :\"The Secretary of the Treasury is the principal economic advisor to the President and plays a critical role in policy-making by bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the government. The Secretary is responsible for formulating and recommending domestic and international financial, economic, and tax policy, participating in the formulation of broad fiscal policies that have general significance for the economy, and managing the public debt. The Secretary oversees the activities of the Department in carrying out its major law enforcement responsibilities; in serving as the financial agent for the United States Government; and in manufacturing coins and currency. :\"The Chief Financial Officer of the government, the Secretary serves as Chairman Pro Tempore of the President's Economic Policy Council, Chairman of the Boards and Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, and as U.S. Governor of the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\" ==Secretaries of the Treasury== Note: Robert Morris was the first person appointed Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington, but Morris declined this office; thus the 1st Secretary of the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton - appointed at Morris's suggestion. Morris had held a similar position as Superintendent of Finance under the Continental Congress. From Morris's 1784 resignation until 1789, the young union's finances were overseen by a three- member Treasury Board. ; Parties (1) (4) (4) (29) (5) (34) Status No. Portrait Name State of residence Took office Left office President(s) Alexander Hamilton New York September 11, 1789 January 31, 1795 George Washington Oliver Wolcott, Jr. Connecticut February 3, 1795 December 31, 1800 John Adams Samuel Dexter Massachusetts January 1, 1801 May 13, 1801 Thomas Jefferson Abraham Alfonse Albert Gallatin Pennsylvania May 14, 1801 February 8, 1814 James Madison George W.
