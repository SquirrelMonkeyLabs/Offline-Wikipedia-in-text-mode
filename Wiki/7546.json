 "text": "Edith Massey (May 25, 1918 - October 24, 1984) was an American actress. She acted in several of director John Waters' most well-known movies: Multiple Maniacs, Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble, Desperate Living, and Polyester. Waters discovered Massey as a waitress in a Baltimore, Maryland, USA bar he and his friends frequented. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Massey capitalized on her Waters infamy by touring as the lead singer of a punk band (Edie and the Eggs) and opening a thrift store in Baltimore called Edith's Shopping Bag. Director Robert Maier made a documentary short about her in 1975 called Love Letter to Edie.
