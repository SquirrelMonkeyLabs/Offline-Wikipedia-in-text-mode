 "text": "Legislature is a word that comes from the Latin language, meaning \"those who write the laws.\" A legislature is therefore a group of people who vote for new laws, for example in a state or country. Each person in the legislature is usually either elected or appointed. The constitution of that state or country usually tells how a legislature is supposed to work. In many countries, the legislature is called a Parliament, Congress, or National Assembly. Sometimes there are two groups of members in the legislature. This is called a \"bicameral\" legislature. A unicameral legislature has only one group of members. A country, district, city, or other small area may also have something like a legislature. These are often called councils, and they make smaller laws for their areas. == List of titles of legislatures == === National === * Parliament * Congress * Diet * National Assembly * Althing — Iceland * Assembleia da República — Portugal * Bundestag — Germany * Riksdag — Sweden * Cortes Generales — Spain * Eduskunta — Finland * Federal Assembly — Russia, Switzerland * Folketing — Denmark * Stortinget — Norway * Knesset — Israel * Assembly of Albania — Albania * Legislative Yuan — Republic of China/Taiwan * Islamic Consultative Assembly — Iran === Sub-National === * List of state legislatures of the United States — United States ** General Assembly / Assembly ** Great and General Court / General Court ** House of Delegates * Landtag — Germany, Austria * Canada ** Legislative Assembly — All provinces and territories except: ** National Assembly — Quebec ** House of Assembly — Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador * Australia ** Legislative Assembly - All States and Territories except: ** House of Assembly - South Australia and Tasmania ** Legislative Council - All States except Queensland * United Kingdom ** Scottish Parliament — Scotland ** Northern Ireland Assembly — Northern Ireland ** National Assembly for Wales — Wales **Houses of Parliament — United Kingdom overall. ==Related pages== *Separation of powers",
