 "text": "In Western Australian politics, an electoral region was a region of the Western Australian Legislative Council, the upper house of the Western Australian Parliament. The system was created in 1989. They will be abolished at the 2025 state election, after reforms by the Labor government of Mark McGowan and Roger Cook. Instead of the Legislative Council being elected from different regions like in Victoria, they will be elected from the state as a whole like in New South Wales and South Australia. ==List== At the 2021 state election, there were six electoral regions: Name Est.
