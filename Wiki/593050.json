 "text": "There are 3 arrondissements in the Cher department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. Arrondissements are further divided into communes. The arrondissements of Cher are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 181 Bourges Bourges 173,889 2,797.8 131 182 Saint-Amand- Montrond Saint-Amand-Montrond 65,145 2,669.8 116 183 Vierzon Vierzon 71,236 1,767.4 43 ==History== * 1790 (4 March) : creation of the department with seven districts: Aubigny, Sancerre, Sancoins, Saint-Amand, Châteaumeillant, Bourges and Vierzon.
