 "text": "Broomhouse is a district of Edinburgh, Scotland. Although on the lands of Old Saughton, its name is adopted from an estate which lay to the north of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. The earliest recorded versions of the name (c.1600) were variations on Brum(e)hous. It mainly comprises a low-rise council housing estate built between 1947 and 1950. It borders on Parkhead, Sighthill, and Saughton Mains. The arterial route of Calder Road (A71) passes to the south. Category:Edinburgh",
