 "text": "Yacht racing is a sport where sailboats, called yachts, race against each other. These boats use wind to move and do not have engines. Races can happen near the shore or across long distances in the ocean. == Rules == In yacht racing, boats compete to finish a course as fast as possible. The course is marked by buoys or other signs. Some races are short and happen near the coast. Others are long and go across the sea or ocean. Races can be just one event or a series of races. Boats come in different sizes and speeds. To make races fair, a system called a \"handicap\" is used. This system adjusts the finish times based on the boat's design. This way, slower boats can still compete fairly with faster ones. Yacht races follow the Racing Rules of Sailing. These rules help keep races safe and fair. They are updated every four years by World Sailing. == Types of races == * Inshore races: these happen close to land. An example is the America's Cup, which started in 1851.Phillips-Birt, Douglas (1974). The History of Yachting. New York: Stein and Day. pp. 28. ISBN 0812817044. * Offshore races: these are longer and go out to sea. The Sydney to Hobart Race in Australia is one of them. * Around- the-world races: these are very long and circle the globe. The Ocean Race is an example. == References == Category:Boat racing",
