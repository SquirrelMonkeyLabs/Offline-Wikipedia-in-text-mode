 "text": "The Gemäldegalerie (Paintng gallery) is an art museum in Berlin that is part of the Kulturforum. It houses one of the largest collections of European paintings from the 13th to 18th centuries in Europe. The museum has a comprehensive German, Early Netherlandish, and Italian collection with about 1250 works. Paintings and art were collected by the Prussian government, not through a royal dynasty. It's collection intended to give a European overview. The collection first opened in 1830 and expanded throughout the 19th century, adding over 1000 paintings and artworks. In 1904, the museum moved to Kaiser Friedrich Museum, today Bode Museum. Several art pieces that were not stored in shelters like larger altars were destroyed or looted during World War 2. The collection was separated into East and West Germany and reunited at the Kulturforum with the German reunification. Notable artists include Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, Hans Holbein, Rogier van der Weyden, Jan van Eyck, Raphael, Botticelli, Titian, Caravaggio, Peter Paul Rubens, David Teniers the Younger, Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer, and Antonio Viviani.
