 "text": "Edward II (25 April 1284 â€“ 21 September 1328) is also known as Edward of Caernarfon. He was the King of England from 1307 until he was forced to abdicate the throne in 1327. His tendency to ignore his nobility in favour of low-born favourites, led to political trouble and eventually to his removal from the throne. He is most remembered for a story about his alleged murder. It was linked to his reliance on the corrupt family of Hugh le Despenser the Younger, which has been seen by some as evidence of his homosexuality.
