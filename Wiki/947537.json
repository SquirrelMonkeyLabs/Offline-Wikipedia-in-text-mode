It is said that a man named Liu became a leader after he killed a giant white serpent that was harming people. Liu was an outlaw at the time, but he had a special destiny.

Emperor Wudi built a temple for Baidi at the bottom of Mount Hua. It was originally called Jilinggong Palace but later changed to Xiyue Temple. Baidi is also the father of two other gods named Huayue Sanniang and Huashan Sanlang. According to a book called Li Shi, Baidi is believed to be able to control the clouds and rain, create everything in the world, and help people. == Sources == Category:Chinese gods and goddesses Category:Religious Confucianism",
