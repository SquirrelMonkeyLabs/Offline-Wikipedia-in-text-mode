 "text": "Babak Zanjani is a very rich Iranian businessman, born in 1974. He ran a big company called Sorinet Group in the United Arab Emirates. In 2013, he was arrested. The government said he kept $2.7 billion of their money. This money belonged to the oil ministry and was supposed to be used for Iran's oil income, which was hard to get because of rules against Iran. Zanjani was found guilty of being dishonest and was sentenced to death. Later, in 2021, the top court in Iran said they would change his sentence if he gave back the money he owed. They stopped his death sentence while waiting for him to return the money. Some people think Zanjani is being blamed for other people's bad actions in Iran. == Related pages == * Alireza Zibahalat Monfared ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Iranian billionaires Category:Living people",
