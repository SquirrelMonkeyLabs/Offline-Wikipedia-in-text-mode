 "text": "The spiny bush frog (Roarchestes echinatus) is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1464 and 1864 meters above sea level. People have seen this frog in grass. Scientists think this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in only one place, but many of these frogs live there. So if climate change changes the frog's home, all the frogs could die. Human beings come to the frog's home on religious trips. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
