This in was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of Bréifne. For this reason the county is also sometimes known as the Breffni County. The natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs made a good defence against invaders. Historically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 when Bréifne was shired and became the county of Cavan. In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century. Parts of Cavan were under Norman influence from the twelfth century. The remains of several buildings from the time can still be seen at Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. There are also some remains of early abbeys in the county, like at Drumlane and Trinity Island. The Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county like Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. Wars aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry. ==Economy== Agriculture is the largest industry in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. Much of Cavan's land is clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making pasture farming the dominant farming system in the county. – Cavan Co. Council, Soils The total farmed area is in the county, and there are approximately 219,568 cattle in Cavan. Peat cutting exists in the northwest of the county, in the Cuilcagh range. Cavan has expanded in other industries, mainly quarrying, energy production and manufacturing facilities. ==Places of interest== * Magh Slécht * Castle Saunderson * Cabra Castle * Cloughoughter Castle * Drumlane Monastery ===Natural Attractions=== * Dún na Rí Forest Park * Killykeen Forest Park * Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark * Lough Sheelin * Cuilcagh * Shannon-Erne Waterway ==References== ==Other websites== *Cavan County Council *Cavan Heritage website *Cavan County Council Retail Strategy 2008–2014 *Development plans for County Cavan and Cavan Town and Environs *Central Statistics Office statistics Cavan",
