 "text": "The siege of Detroit took place from August 15â€“16, 1812, during the War of 1812 and Tecumseh's War. During the siege, Major General Isaac Brock and Shawnee leader Tecumseh along with his allies both led an attack on Fort Shelby in Detroit, Michigan Territory. Brock and Tecumseh defeated the American army and took control of the Fort and town of Detroit after U.S. Brigadier General William Hull surrendered. Brock and Tecumseh had an army of 330 regulars and 400 militia, along with 600 Natives, 5 field guns and 2 ships. Hull had an army of 2,500 and 1 brig. The victory at Fort Shelby helped motivate Upper Canada during the war. Brock was viewed as a hero in Upper Canada and was knighted for the victory, while Tecumseh gained more influence over the confederation of Indians. A song titled \"The Bold Canadian\" was written by Cornelius Flummerfelt, a private in Third York Militia's First Flank Company in celebration of the capture. A bronze statue of Brock and Tecumseh was erected in the Sandwich Towne neighborhood of Windsor, Ontario. == References == Category:1810s in the United States Category:History of Detroit Category:War of 1812",
