 "text": "Norbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American theoretical and applied mathematician. He was a child prodigy. His father was a teacher of languages. Wiener founded cybernetics, the science of control and communication in animals and machines. It is a field that uses the notion of feedback, and is important for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. The name of the science comes from his book, Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (1948). \"Information is information, not matter or energy\". – Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics (1948, 155) Wiener was born in Columbia, Missouri. He died in Stockholm, Sweden. == Books by Norbert Wiener == *1933: The Fourier Integral and certain of its applications. Cambridge Univ.
