 "text": "The 10th Mountain Division is a unit of the United States Army, now serving under the XVIII Airborne Corps. It has fought in many battles and actions, including the Battle of Mogadishu and many of the actions fought by its corps. The unit's specialty involves moving across mountainous terrain and fighting effectively in harsh conditions. Like the rest of the corps, it is an elite unit that can be transported (albeit in an unlikely case) through airborne means. It is now based at Fort Drum, New York. More recently, the 10th Mountain has been conducting operations in Iraq. ==References== Category:United States Army",
