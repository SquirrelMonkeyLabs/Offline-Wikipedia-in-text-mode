 "text": "Norman E. Hallendy (April 7, 1932 — October 27, 2023) was an Arctic researcher, writer and photographer. Hallendy's Arctic journeys began in 1958 at a time when many Inuit, who traditionally lived on the land, were moving to permanent settlements created by the Federal government. Returning north year after year, he was befriended by Inuit elders who shared with him their perception of their material and spiritual world. == Works == His previous books include the best selling Inuksuit: * Tukiliit: The Stone People Who Live in the Wind * Wilderness: Arctic Voices from a Land of Vast Horizons He has been a lecturer at Oxford, Cambridge, UNESCO (Paris) including numerous universities in Canada and abroad. His most enjoyable presentations were to Inuit elders and their children in several Arctic communities. == Awards and recognitions == Norman Hallendy has been named one of Canada’s 100 greatest modern-day explorers by Canadian Geographic Society. His contribution to geographical knowledge through documenting Arctic landscapes and ancient sites earned him the coveted Mungo Park Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 2007 placing him among such esteemed persons as Professor Jean Malaurie, Count Eigil Knuth and Thor Heyerdahl. In 2001, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society awarded Hallendy the Gold medal for his internationally acclaimed work on inuksuit and ethnographic work in southwest Baffin Island placing him among such outstanding contributors to geography as Michael Palin, Gilbert Grosvenor and Sir Christopher Ondaatje.

Dr. William Fitzhugh Director of the Arctic Studies Centre of the Smithsonian Institution regards Hallendy as a modern day Knud Rasmussen.
