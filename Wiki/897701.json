 "text": "Łazienki Park or Royal Baths Park () is the largest park in Warsaw, Poland, occupying 76 hectares of the city center. The park is within Warsaw's central district on Ujazdów Avenue, which is part of the Royal Route linking the Royal Castle with Wilanów Palace to the south of the park. While Ujazdów Castle is north of Łazienki Park Łazienki Park was originally designed in the 17th century as a baths park for nobleman Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski. In the 18th century the park was transformed by Poland's last monarch, Stanislaus II Augustus for palaces, villas, classicist follies, and monuments. In 1918 it was officially made as a public park. Łazienki is visited by tourists from all over Poland and the world, and serves as a venue for music, the arts, and culture. The park is also home to large number of wildlife. == Gallery == Historic images Image:Canaletto Łazienki.PNG|Łazienki Park, 1775, by Bernardo Bellotto Image:Widok palacu w Lazienkach latem.jpg|Łazienki Palace, 1836, by Marcin Zaleski Image:ZaleskiMarcin.PalacMyslewickiWLazienkach.jpg|Myslewicki Palace, 1830s, by Marcin Zaleski Image:Lazienki Park Warsaw about 1900.jpg|Roman theater, ca. 1900 By Vogel (1800s) Image:Lazienki Krolewskie.jpg|Palace on the Water Image:Lazienki przy ksiezycu.jpg|Palace on the Water by moonlight Image:Lazienki amfiteatr.jpg|Roman theater Image:Kosciol w Ujazdowie.jpg|Ujazdów Church Garden features Image:KIng John III Sobieski Monument in Warsaw.png|Equestrian statue of King Jan III Sobieski Image:Warszawabk1.jpg|18th-century garden sculpture Image:Poland Warsaw Łazienki Park 2.jpg|Summer Sunday piano recital at Chopin monument Image:Lazienki-pawie.jpg|Peacocks at Roman theater — one of several animal species in the park Museum of Hunting and Horsemanship File:Warszawa Muzeum Łowiectwa i Jeździectwa 04.jpg File:JM16 DSC0742.JPG File:Stajnie Kubickiego Muzeum Łowiectwa i Jeździectwa 05.JPG == References == Category:Parks in Europe Category:1918 establishments in Europe",
