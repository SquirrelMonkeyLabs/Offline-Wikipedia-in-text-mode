 "text": "The Suweon tree frog (Dryophytes suweonensis) is a frog that lives in Korea. It mostly lives in rice paddies. It lives north of the Chilgap Mountain Range. Most of these frogs live in South Korea but some live in North Korea. ==Appearance== The adult frog is 2.7 to 3.2 cm long from nose to rear end. This frog is green or brown most of the year but it turns bright green when it is time to find mates and lay eggs. It has a yellow stomach all year. Unlike many other tree frogs, this frog looks for food during the day. ==Threats== This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives by building cities, building farms, cutting down trees, and letting animals eat grass there. Chemicals meant to kill pests, chemicals that make plants row, and disease also kill this frog. Human beings also brought other frogs to the area, and those other frogs sometimes take too much of the food. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
