In 1956 Pakistan established its first constitution and became a Republic, and the Queen and Governor-General were replaced by the president. Pakistan's first president was Iskander Mirza, who was also the last Governor General. In 1958, he removed the constitution and declared martial law. A few weeks later, he was overthrown by General Ayub Khan, who then declared himself president. The constitution was changed and the president became the ruler of Pakistan. The constitution also said that the president be elected by the people. Elections were held in 1963, and Khan defeated Fatima Jinnah, sister of founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. == List of presidents of Pakistan == Key for presidents list Party name Republican Party Muslim League (C) Armed Forces Independent Muslim League (Q) Peoples Party Muslim League (N) Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf == List of presidents of Pakistan == No Portrait Name Elections Took office Left office Political party Note 1 Iskander Mirza 1958 Pakistani coup d'état 23 March 1956 27 October 1958 Republican Party 2 Ayub Khan 1958 Pakistani coup d'état 27 October 1958 8 June 1962 Military Dictator 2 January 1965 8 June 1962 29 November 1963 Military Dictator Pakistan Muslim League (C) — Mohammad Afzal Cheema Acting — 1962 1963 Senior Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly 1962-1965 — Fazlul Qadir Chaudhry Acting — 29 November 1963 12 June 1965 Pakistan Muslim League (C) Ayub Khan 2 January 1965 12 June 1965 31 March 1969 Pakistan Muslim League (C) 3 Yahya Khan —Military Dictator 31 March 1969 20 December 1971 Military Dictator 4 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto 20 December 1971 20 December 1971 13 August 1973 Pakistan Peoples Party 5 Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry 14 August 1973 14 August 1973 20 April 1978 Pakistan Peoples Party — Sheikh Anwarul Haq Acting 14 August 1973 20 April 1978 7 May 1978 Pakistan Peoples Party Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry 14 August 1973 7 May 1978 16 September 1978 Pakistan Peoples Party 6 Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq Military Dictator 16 September 1978 17 August 1988 Military Dictator 7 Ghulam Ishaq Khan 13 December 1988 17 August 1988 18 July 1993 Independent — Wasim Sajjad Acting 1995 Pakistani coup d'état attempt 18 July 1993 14 November 1993 Pakistan Muslim League (N) 8 Farooq Leghari 14 November 1993 14 November 1993 2 December 1997 Pakistan Peoples Party — Wasim Sajjad Acting — 27 December 1997 1 January 1998 Pakistan Muslim League (N) 9 Muhammad Rafiq Tarar 31 December 1997 1999 Pakistani coup d'état 1 January 1998 20 June 2001 Pakistan Muslim League (N) 10 Pervez Musharraf Military Dictator 20 June 2001 6 October 2007 1 January 2004 6 October 2007 6 October 2007 18 August 2008 Military Dictator Pakistan Muslim League (Q) — Muhammad Mian Soomro Acting — 18 August 2008 9 September 2008 Pakistan Muslim League (N) 11 Asif Ali Zardari 6 September 2008 9 September 2008 9 September 2013 Pakistan Peoples Party 12 Mamnoon Hussain 30 July 2013 9 September 2013 9 September 2018 Pakistan Muslim League (N) 13 Arif Alvi 4 September 2018 9 September 2018 10 March 2024 Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (11) Asif Ali Zardari 9 March 2024 10 March 2024 Incumbent Pakistan Peoples Party ==Living former presidents== File:President of Pakistan Dr Arif Alvi.jpg| == Present holder of the post == The President is now Arif Alvi, a former dentist.
