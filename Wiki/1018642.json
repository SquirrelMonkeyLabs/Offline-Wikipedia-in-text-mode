It lives in the Ngoc Sonâ€“Ngo Luong Nature Reserve and Cuc Phuong National Park. ==Body== The adult male frog is about 27.1-28.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 30.3-32.6 long. The skin of the frog's back is gray-green in color. The throat, belly, sides, and parts of the legs are brown with white spots. ==Home== This frog lives in forests that have karst rock and limestone rock in the ground. People see them near caves and on cliffs. People see this frog far from water. This frog can live in forest that was cut down and is growing back. People have seen this frog between 67 and 650 meters above sea level. Scientists think this frog's tadpoles swim in the water, like other tadpoles in Theloderma, but they have not seen them yet. ==Danger== Scientists do not know if this frog is in danger of dying out or not. Human beings change the places where the frog lives by changing forests into farms by cutting trees to get wood to build with, and by digging up karst rock to use. People sometimes catch this frog to sell as a pet, but scientists do not know if that is a danger to the frog. Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Ngo Luong-Ngoc Son Nature Reserve, Trang An Landscape Complex, and Cuc Phuong National Park. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
