Master of villainy: a biography of Sax Rohmer. Bowling Green University Press, Ohio. He is best remembered for his creation of the master criminal Dr Fu Manchu.\"Rohmer, Sax\" by Jack Adrian in David Pringle, St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998; (pp. 482–484). After ghostwriting the autobiography of Little Tich, a music hall entertainer, Ward issued the first Fu Manchu novel. This was The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu, serialised from October 1912 to June 1913. It was an immediate success. It had police official Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie facing a worldwide conspiracy led by a mastermind. It reflected the \"yellow peril\" scares of the times. The phrase yellow peril (sometimes yellow terror or yellow spectre), was coined by Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, in the 1890s. The Fu Manchu stories, and other writing, made Rohmer one of the most successful and well-paid authors of the 1920s and 1930s. == References == Category:1883 births Category:1959 deaths Category:English novelists Category:Writers from Birmingham",
