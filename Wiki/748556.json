 "text": "In astronomy, a parabolic trajectory (also known as parabolic orbit or parabolic escape trajectory) refers to an object (such as an asteroid) which follows a path similar to a parabola around another object. This motion follows Kepler's Laws. A parabolic trajectory occurs when the eccentricity of its orbit is equal to 1. Other types of motion in astronomy include circular orbit, elliptical orbit, and hyperbolic trajectory. Category:Orbits",
