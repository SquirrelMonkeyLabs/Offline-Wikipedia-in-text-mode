Since 0 is false, AND outputs the product (result of multiplication) of its inputs. That means that if either or both of its inputs are 0, the output will be 0 (zero multiplied by any real number is zero). == Symbols == There are three symbols for the AND gate: MIL/ANSI Symbol IEC Symbol DIN Symbol Category:Logic gates",
