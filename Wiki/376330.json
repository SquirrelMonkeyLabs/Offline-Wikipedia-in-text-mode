 "text": "Road signs in Africa stay close to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals concerning shape and function. There are also some local signs unique to South Africa. A white background signifies the sign is permanent. A yellow background signifies that the sign is temporary. Warning signs are an upwards- pointing red triangle and black pictogram describing the danger or obstruction. Speed limit signs are a red circle with the limitation in black. South Africa drives on the left. ==Priority signs== File:SADC road sign R1.svg|Stop File:SADC road sign R2.svg|Give Way File:SADC road sign R2.1.svg|Give Way to pedestrians File:SADC road sign R2.2.svg|Give Way at roundabout (give way to vehicles coming from the right) File:SADC road sign R3.svg|Do not enter File:SADC road sign R4.1.svg|One-way traffic (left) File:SADC road sign R4.2.svg|One way traffic (right) File:SADC road sign R4.3.svg|One way traffic (forward) File:SADC road sign R5.svg|Pedestrians priority ==Prohibitory signs== File:SADC road sign R208.svg|No unauthorized vehicles File:SADC road sign R213.svg|No U-turn File:SADC road sign R216.svg|No parking File:SADC road sign R217.svg|No stopping ===Temporary prohibitory signs=== File:SADC road sign TR208.svg|No unauthorized vehicles File:SADC road sign TR216.svg|No parking File:SADC road sign TR217.svg|No stopping ==Warning signs== File:SADC road sign W201.svg|Roundabout ahead File:SADC road sign W202.svg|Gentle curve right File:SADC road sign W203.svg|Gentle curve left File:SADC road sign W204.svg|Sharp curve right File:SADC road sign W205.svg|Sharp curve left File:SADC road sign W206.svg|Hairpin turn (to right) File:SADC road sign W207.svg|Hairpin turn (to left) File:SADC road sign W208.svg|Winding road File:SADC road sign W209.svg|Winding road File:SADC road sign W210.svg|Combined curves File:SADC road sign W211.svg|Combined curves File:SADC road sign W212.svg|Two way traffic File:SADC road sign W213.svg|Two way traffic crossroad File:SADC road sign W214.svg|Right lane ends File:SADC road sign W215.svg|Left lane ends File:SADC road sign W216.svg|Concealed driveway File:SADC road sign W217.svg|Concealed driveway File:SADC road sign W218.svg|Concealed driveway File:SADC road sign W301.svg|Traffic Signals ahead File:SADC road sign W302.svg|STOP ahead File:SADC road sign W303.svg|Give Way ahead File:SADC road sign W306.svg|Pedestrian crossing File:SADC road sign W307.svg|Pedestrian File:SADC road sign W308.svg|Children File:SADC road sign W319.svg|Tunnel ahead File:SADC road sign W327.svg|Single vehicle passage structure ahead File:SADC road sign W339.svg|General Warning (this sign may include an additional information plate below it) ===Temporary warning signs=== File:SADC road sign TW201.svg|Roundabout ahead File:SADC road sign TW202.svg|Gentle curve right File:SADC road sign TW203.svg|Gentle curve left File:SADC road sign TW204.svg|Sharp curve right File:SADC road sign TW205.svg|Sharp curve left File:SADC road sign TW206.svg|Hairpin turn (to right) File:SADC road sign TW207.svg|Hairpin turn (to left) File:SADC road sign TW208.svg|Winding road File:SADC road sign TW209.svg|Winding road File:SADC road sign TW210.svg|Combined curves File:SADC road sign TW211.svg|Combined curves File:SADC road sign TW212.svg|Two way traffic File:SADC road sign TW213.svg|Two way traffic crossroad File:SADC road sign TW214.svg|Right lane ends File:SADC road sign TW215.svg|Left lane ends File:SADC road sign TW216.svg|Concealed driveway File:SADC road sign TW217.svg|Concealed driveway File:SADC road sign TW218.svg|Concealed driveway File:SADC road sign TW301.svg|Traffic Signals ahead File:SADC road sign TW302.svg|STOP ahead File:SADC road sign TW303.svg|Give Way ahead File:SADC road sign TW306.svg|Pedestrian crossing File:SADC road sign TW307.svg|Pedestrian File:SADC road sign TW308.svg|Children File:SADC road sign TW327.svg|Single vehicle passage structure ahead File:SADC road sign TW339.svg|General Warning (this sign may include an additional information plate below it) ==Information signs== File:SADC road sign R401.svg|Dual- carriageway motorway begins File:SADC road sign R402.svg|Single-carriageway motorway begins File:SADC road sign R403.svg|Residential zone begins File:SADC road sign R401-600.svg|Dual-carriageway motorway ends File:SADC road sign R402-600.svg|Single-carriageway motorway ends File:SADC road sign R403-600.svg|Residential zone ends File:SADC road sign IN4.svg|Dead end ===Temporary information signs=== File:SADC road sign TR402.svg|Single- carriageway motorway begins File:SADC road sign TR402-600.svg|Single- carriageway motorway ends File:SADC road sign TIN4.svg|Dead end ==References== * Road signs in South Africa - K53 Learners App * getyourlearners.co.za S Category:Transport in South Africa",
