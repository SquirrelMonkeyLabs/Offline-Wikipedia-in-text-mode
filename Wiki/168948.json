 "text": "Fairness means treating people equally or in the right way (according to accepted standards). Fairness is an important concept in sociology, law, and society. It is an key part of legal and social justice. == What is fairness? == Fairness can mean several things. For example, it can mean sameness, where everybody gets the same things in order to keep everybody equal. Fairness can also mean \"deservedness\", meaning a person gets what they deserve. People who are successful by working hard get what they deserve. People who are lazy and do not work hard get less. Fairness can also be based on need. Those who have more should give more to help others. This is based on the concept that people have obligations to each other. Fairness involves keeping decisions free from any form of bias or discrimination. Judges, lawmakers, referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions. == Equality vs equity == In the United States, fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity. Equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity. If all the horses in a race start from the same point, the horse that wins is the fastest. Equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for everybody. In this sense, one person should get more than another. For example, in the game of golf, when playing a skilled golfer, a less skilled golfer may be given a \"handicap\" (less points) at the start of the game. This is to help make the final score fair for both players. == References == Category:Sociology",
