 "text": "Mario Is Missing! is an educational video game in the Mario series of games by Nintendo in 1992. The main character is Mario's brother, Luigi. Luigi tries to save Mario after the turtle king Bowser kidnaps him. The game was released on SNES, NES, Windows, and Mac. A remastered version was released in 2021. ==Reception== This was not very popular, due to it not teaching properly in its key subject, history. Furthermore, it wasn’t a normal Mario platform game like the series focuses on. ==Sequel== After the first game, Nintendo released a game called Mario’s Time Machine. It was similar, and just like the first game, it didn’t do well. ==References== Category:1993 video games Category:Luigi games Category:Educational video games Category:Classic Mac OS games Category:DOS games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Single-player video games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games about missing people Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Greece Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Paris",
