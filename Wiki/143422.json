 "text": "The Peugeot 307 is a car produced by Peugeot. It replaced the 306 in June 2001 with 3 and 5-door hatchback models. In 2002, the SW estate was added and in late 2003 saw the 307 CC coupé/cabriolet launched. It was facelifted in 2005 and was replaced in 2007 by the 308. The platform of the 307 were also used for the Citroën C4. The model sold well but didn't have great reliability although it was improved with later models. == Versions == File:Peugeot 307 3D Facelift front - TTM 2009.jpg|3-door hatchback (307) File:2002 Peugeot 307 Rapier 16V 1.6 Front.jpg|5-door hatchback (307) File:2005 Peugeot 307 (T5 MY03) CC Sport convertible (2015-11-11) 01.jpg|2-door coupé/cabriolet (307 CC) File:Peugeot 307SW front 20080102.jpg|5-door station wagon (307 SW) == Engines == === Petrol === * 1.4 55 kW (75 hp) * 1.4 16V 65 kW (88 hp) * 1.6 16V 80 kW (109 hp) * 2.0 16V 100 kW (136 hp) and 103 kW (140 hp) * 2.0 16V RC 130 kW (177 hp) === Diesel === * 1.4 HDi 50 kW (68 hp) * 1.6 HDi 66 kW (90 hp) and 80 kW (109 hp) * 2.0 HDi 66 kW (90 hp), 79 kW (107 hp), 80 kW (109 hp) and 100 kW (136 hp) 307 Category:2000s automobiles",
