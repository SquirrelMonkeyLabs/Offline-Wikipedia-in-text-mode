 "text": "This is a list of tallest structures in the world, past and present of any type. Most of the structures are television broadcasting masts. There are also the taller tower-type structures (like the CN Tower) and the taller high rise buildings (like the Sears Tower). The list also includes some other structures like oil platforms, electrical towers, bridge towers, etc. List is organized by absolute height since it includes many different classes of structures. This list includes quite a few masts. A mast is a man-made support structure, commonly used on sailing ships as support for sails, or on land as radio masts and towers used to support telecommunication equipment such as radio antennas (\"aerials\" in the UK). ==Terminology== There is often ambiguity between the terms tower and mast. A tower is a self-supporting or cantilevered structure, while a mast is held up by stays or guys.See List of towers Both towers and masts have limited floor space and are non-building structures, as opposed to regular buildings which have greater floor space for occupancy. The terminology is further confused through misuse. Skyscrapers are often referred to as towersSee List of tallest buildings in the world and some towers use the term mast. Ironically, skyscraper has some etymology from references to high sailboat masts. == List by height == ===Notes=== * A minimum height limit of 350 m (1,148 ft) or 300 m (984 ft) for notable structures is used for practical purposes to keep the list to a reasonable length. * Likely structures still missing from this list include masts used for the Russian navigation system RSDN-20. * Structures no longer standing are in italics. * For all structures the pinnacle height is given. So the height of skyscrapers may differ from the values at List of skyscrapers. * Most of the taller masts are in the United States, where a prevalence of masts of around 2,000 feet (610 m) in height is the result of special rules in that country limiting structures and objects taller than 2,063 feet (629 m). * Structures under construction are included in main list if its current height is over 350 m (1,148 ft). ===Top 30 of all time=== Name Height (ft) Height (m) Year Structural type Main use Country Town Remarks Coordinates Burj Khalifa 2,275 688 2008 Skyscraper Office, hotel, residential United Arab Emirates Dubai tallest structure in the world Warsaw Radio Mast 2,118 645.4 1974 Guyed mast LF-transmission Poland Gąbin-Konstantynów, Masovian Voivodeship insulated; collapsed on August 8, 1991 during guy wire exchange KVLY/KTHI TV Mast 2,063 628.8 1963 Guyed mast UHF/VHF-transmission U.S. Blanchard, North Dakota World's tallest mast KXJB-TV mast 2,060 627.8 1998 Guyed mast UHF/VHF- transmission U.S. Galesburg, North Dakota rebuilt after collapses on February 14, 1968 and on April 6, 1997 KXTV/KOVR Tower 2,049 624.5 2000 Guyed mast UHF/VHF-transmission U.S. Walnut Grove, California Tallest structure in California Canton Tower 2,001 610 2010 Concrete tower Observation, TV transmission People's Republic of China Guangzhou tallest structure in China Petronius Platform 2,001 610 2000 Offshore platform Oil drilling Gulf of Mexico Petronius field Located appr. southeast of New Orleans KATV Tower 2,000 609.6 1965?1967?
