 "text": "Classical Meitei or Classical Manipuri is the standardized literary form of the Meitei language (Manipuri language), used most notably in the Puya (Meitei texts), and is also the liturgical language of Sanamahism (Meitei religion). It represents the development of the rich literary sources of the present day Meitei literature (Manipuri literature). It is around 3500 years old. It reaches the criteria for being a classical languageâ€˜Manipur language which belongs to Tibeto-Burma has touched the criteria of a classical language' | Pothashang News as it has attained the following four criteria: # It has a recorded history of more than 3500 years, exceeding 1500 years of history, for general criteria. # It has a huge volume of ancient literature and is the heritage of the present generation. # It has an original literary tradition independent from the other speech communities. # It has its ancient literature being distinct from the modern form. The modern Meitei is an offshoot of the old Meitei. The presently available volume of ancient literature is actually lessened due to the dark historical event of Puya Mei Thaba (literally, \"burning of the manuscripts\") in the 18th century AD. At the same time, many of the ancient folklore and poetic works are still preserved in its oral traditional form linking with the Lai Haraoba festival. ==Sources== * A case of classical language * The Sangai Express - Largest Circulated NewsPaper in Manipur - MP for classical language status * Manipur Govt Begins Efforts for Inclusion of Manipuri Among 'Classical' Languages - INSIDE NE * The Sangai Express - Largest Circulated NewsPaper in Manipur - MP for classical language status * http://www.uniindia.com/information-minister-wants-recognition-of-manipuri-language-as-classical-language/other/news/965687.html * Process for recognising Manipuri as classical language of India underway: MP Sanajaoba * Will Manipuri be a Classical Language By Chungkham Yashawanta == References == == Other websites == Category:Meitei literature Category:Sino-Tibetan languages",
