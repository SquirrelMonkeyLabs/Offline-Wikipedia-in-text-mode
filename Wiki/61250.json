 "text": "Ellipsis is a term of punctuation marks with a row of three points (…). Its name comes from the ancient Greek word ἔλλειψις (omission/falling short). Notice that the three dots are not spaced as full points: they are a separate special typographic sign. Depending on context and place in a sentence, ellipses can indicate an unfinished thought, a leading statement, a slight pause, a mysterious or echoing voice, or a nervous or awkward silence. An ellipsis can be used to trail off into silence—for example: But I thought he was… * So much more could be said… When text is quoted from a book or a newspaper, it stands for words that have been cut out to save space in a page. For example: * \"…one day all Americans will live peacefully throughout the world…they will be at peace with all other world inhabitants…\" When speaking, it can be referred to as \"dot-dot-dot\". In mathematics, different symbols for ellipsis are used to a similar effect. These include the horizontal ellipsis symbols \\ldots and \\cdots, along with vertical ellipsis symbols such as \\vdots and \\ddots . ==Related pages== *Punctuation == References == * Bringhurst, Robert 2002.
