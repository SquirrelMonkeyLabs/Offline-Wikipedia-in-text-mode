 "text": "Gerard Gertoux (born on March 19, 1955 in Lyon) is a French chronologist,: \"Fortunately, thanks to one honest chronological researcher, Gérard Gertoux, his research completely dovetails with the conclusion of the present author had already determined. Indeed, he has persented an excellent testimony from other notable ancient historians that Carthage was indeed founded exactly where the Bible places it, right around the year of 870 BCE.\": \"Gertoux, who compiled a credible chronology of Jesus's life, also places his baptism in AD29, although he calculated that Jesus was baptized during August.\" historian and researcher in the field of Near Eastern archaeology: \"Gertoux, a French academic and researcher concerned with Near Eastern archaeology.\" and Ancient history,: \"Gérard Gertoux (1955–) is a French academic who is best known for his book The name of God Y.eH.oW.aH. However, most of his prodigious output is concerned with ancient chronology.\" particularly Egyptian, Assyrian, Jewish, and research on the Tetragrammaton YHWH.: \"Gerard Gertoux of the University of Lyon, has specialised on the Tetragrammaton. His works are recommended reading for a detailed study on the topic of the Tetragrammaton\" Gertoux argued that one of the several ancient vocalizations of the tetragrammaton was Yehowah,: \"I adopt the (albeit minority) view that one of its ancient vocalizations was yəhōwɔ̄ (Gertoux 2015), contra the mainstream consensus that it was only yahwɛ.\" like Thomas Römer has proposed 'Yahô' or 'Yahû,: \"It does seem clear that the original pronunciation of Yhwh was 'Yahô' or 'Yahû F. C. Burkitt for Yaho or Yeho, Max Reisel for YeHūàH or YaHūàH, etc. contra the mainstream consensus that it was only Yahweh.: \"Against the consensus that God's name was ponounced 'Yahweh', Gérard Gertoux has defended 'Yehowah' (i.e., Jehovah).\" Gertoux's astronomical synchronization into their chronologies of ancient history have offered new conclusions.: \"I have read the manuscript \"Basic astronomy for historians to get a chronology\" of Gerard Gertoux and found it a well-informed and informative introduction to this complicated subject. It clearly explains what is required from a historian who wants to establish the chronology of historical events. The author shows by examples how different chronologies can be evaluated or refuted. He also explains the astronomical phenomena that can be used for dating events, and the pitfalls in using ancient calendars. For some cases, he offers new conclusions or refutes chronologies proposed by other scholars. The manuscript forces the reader to be very attentive, but this attention is well worth it\".: \"He obtained by synchronization with astronomical data and events occurring among other peoples.\" == Life == Gérard Gertoux was born on March 19, 1955 in the 7th arrondissement of Lyon.: \"Gertoux Gérard, né à Lyon 7e, le 19 mars 1955, de nationalité française\" He obtained a degree in Physical Engineering at École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs électriciens de Grenoble (I.N.P.G.) in 1979. In 1985, he obtained a Certificate of aptitude for secondary school (CAPES) in Physics to become a certified professor, and he was a professor of national education until 2012. From 1992 to 1993, and 2001, he studied Hebrew language at the Académie des langues anciennes with Elie Cohen, at the Sessions de langues bibliques with Jean Margain and at the Institut des langues anciennes of the École normale supérieure of Paris with Jean-Claude Haelewyck and Georges Bohas. In 2005, he obtained a Master of Science of Archaeology and History of Ancient Worlds at the Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée, Lumière University Lyon 2 with the thesis entitled: L'œil de l'histoire: la chronologie. Les éclipses dans l'antiquité: approche scientifique d'une chronologie under the tutelage of Yves Roman and Michel Debidour. From 2012 he become a member of The International Association for Assyriology. == Contributions == === The name YHWH === In 1999, Gertoux published his book Un historique du nom divin: un nom encens . In 2002, he translated his book into English entitled The Name of God Y.eH.oW.aH Which is Pronounced as it is Written I_Eh_oU_Ah. It Story, published in 2002 by the University Press of America and expanded the appendix and some of the content. Gertoux's book The Name of God Y.eH.oW.aH Which is Pronounced as it is Written I_Eh_oU_Ah. It Story, is cited in reference works such as the The Encyclopedia of Christianity, the Encyclopedia of Ancient Christianity and the Μεγάλη Ορθόδοξη Χριστιανική Εγυκλοπαίδεια (ΜΟΧΕ) [Great Orthodox Christian Encyclopedia]. Robert J. Wilkinson says that Gertoux has strong views on the pronunciation and meaning of the Tetragrammaton. George W. Buchanan agrees with Gertoux that the divine name is arbitrarily pronounced as Jehovah on the basis of the data. Aviv Schoenfeld says that he adopts \"the (albeit minority) view that one of its ancient vocalizations was yəhōwɔ̄ (Gertoux 2015), contra the mainstream consensus that it was only yahwɛ\". Bruce M. Metzger says that Gertoux's website contains \"scholarly information on the origins of sacred names\". François Bœspflug states that Gertoux's research provided him with valuable information. Daniel Faivre wrote that Gertoux's work is a more comprehensive study. Philippe Barbey considers Gertoux's research to be a comprehensive work. Antonio Macaya Pascual points out that Gertoux provides ample evidence that the name YHWH was actually pronounced until the 2nd century AD. John Gee is of the opinion that Egyptian and Akkadian evidence is ignored, that the Masoretic vowels have a later pronunciation and that the letter method is not applicable. Gertoux responds, and says that Gee did not even read the book, and his unsubstantiated claims are not explained in his criticism. Didier Fontaine says that \"Gertoux gives more than twenty 'explanations' (p.64) that make you think\". Won W. Lee affirm: \"this detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation of the centuries\". Jean Vernette at the beginning of his book on Cults explained that 'Jehovah' was a barbarism, but already in the sixth and last edition of his book (January 2002) he withdrew the explanations used to defend Yahweh, and wrote that it is clear that some people defend the pronunciation of Jehovah, quoting Gertoux in a footnote. P. D. Vasileiadis also considers the work of G. Gertoux as a source that presents an overview of the long-standing efforts to translate the Tetragrammaton into Greek. === Ancient history === Gertoux created Egyptian, Assyrian and biblical chronologies which, according to Hermann Hunger,: I have read the manuscript \"Basic astronomy for historians to get a chronology\" of Gerard Gertoux and found it a well-informed and informative introduction to this complicated subject. It clearly explains what is required from a historian who wants to establish the chronology of historical events. The author shows by examples how different chronologies can be evaluated or refuted. He also explains the astronomical phenomena that can be used for dating events, and the pitfalls in using ancient calendars. For some cases, he offers new conclusions or refutes chronologies proposed by other scholars. The manuscript forces the reader to be very attentive, but this attention is well worth it. Gertoux \"offers new conclusions or refutes chronologies proposed by other scholars\". The Armstrong Institute of Biblical Archaeology mentions that Gertoux's research presents a remarkable body of evidence for the historicity of the book of Esther, and even the historicity of Queen Esther.: \"As for the overall historicity of the book—despite widespread dismissal from skeptics—there is likewise a remarkable body of evidence for it, including the historical identity of Queen Esther herself. For more on this, read a thorough investigation by Gerard Gertoux here.\" Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones disagrees: \"Esther is not a history book and it does not contain history per se (in spite of the valiant effort by Gérard Gertoux (2015) to fix Esther's narrative precisely in time).\" Albertus Pretorius is of the opinion that Gertoux created a reliable chronology of the life of Jesus. Paul Finch believes that Gertoux has provided excellent evidence that Carthage was founded in 870 BC. Kenneth C. Griffith and Darrell K. White considers \"Gertoux’s chronology of the Kings of Aram to be the most accurate\". == Works == ;Theses * * * * * * * ; Books * * * * * * * * * * ;Articles * * * * * ;Video documentaries * ;Conferences * * * * * == References == === Sources === * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Other websites == * Category:French people Category:1955 births Category:Semiticists",
