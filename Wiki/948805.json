Its headquarters are located in Barangay South Triangle, Quezon City, with offices in Makati City and in Tacloban. It owns a number of radio stations across the country under the FM Radio Philippines (Favorite Music Radio) network and AM radio station Radyo 630, as well as television stations PRTV Prime Media and PRTV Tacloban. ==History== PCMC was founded on May 21, 2008. It was signed into law under Republic Act 9773 in 2009, initially its broadcast operations only limited covering the Eastern Visayas region. In April 25, 2011, PCMC launched 3 stations in Tacloban: AM station DYBR (discontinued in 2013 following the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan), FM station DYDR, and the first local independent TV station PRTV. The company's legislative franchise was later amended in 2020 under Republic Act 11508, allowing PCMC to operate national broadcast albeit without President Rodrigo Duterte's signature as the bill lapsed into law after 30 days of inaction. PCMC launched its own FM network Favorite Music Radio (or FMR, based on the owner's initials), with its flagship station DYDR in Tacloban was relaunched under the said brand. PCMC is expected to expand the FMR network into 35 radio stations nationwide. In May 2021, PCMC and Prime Media Holdings, Inc. (PMHI/PRIM), a publicly-traded investment firm involving real estate and hospitality, signed a share-for-share swap agreement through a backdoor listing. Under the deal, PCMC shareholders will exchange their shares of common stock to take majority control of PRIM, which will acquire PCMC and will become the latter's subsidiary. With the expansion of its radio and television operations, the company is expected to launch a national TV network with its plans to collaborate with several content providers (among them is ABS-CBN Corporation). On September 20, 2021, PCMC was signed by ZOE Broadcasting Network an affiliation deal to air A2Z's programming on PRTV Tacloban, As a result, PRTV Tacloban became a network-affiliated station for the first time in its history. In 2022, Prime Media's memorandum was later revised following PCMC's shareholders created a holding firm Golden Peregrine Holdings (GPHI) which was already acquired PCMC, therefore GPHI became a direct subsidiary of PMHI with PCMC as its indirect subsidiary. On May 6, 2024, ABS-CBN's flagship newscast TV Patrol begin airing on all Favorite Music Radio stations nationwide.TV Patrol mapakikinggan na rin sa ilang FM Radio stations simula May 6 | TV Patrol On May 27, 2024, PCMC and Prime Media formally launched its own national TV channel Prime TV, which serves as an expansion of the PRTV brand.
