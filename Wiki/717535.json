When Algeria was invaded by France in 1830, he began a rebellion against the French for a decade until 1842 with a number of tribes. In 1837, he signed the Treaty of Tafna with Marshall Bugeaud. But King Louis-Philippe broke the treaty two years later, leading Emir to declare against Jihad on October 15, 1839. In 1847, he was exiled to France from 1847 to October 1852. When he was released by Napoleon III, Emir then took up his residence in Damascus. In July 1860, he ceased a conflict between Muslims and Christians. While he was in Damascus, he wrote books and composed poesy. Emir Abdelkader died on the May 26, 1883 and was buried in Damascus. On July 5, 1966, the Algerian government brought his remains back to Algeria to be interred on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of independence and the 136th anniversary of the French conquest. A mosque bearing his name has been constructed as a national shrine in Constantine. He is seen by the Algerians as their national hero. == References == Category:1807 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Algerian politicians Category:Arab people Category:Berber people Category:Damascus Category:Freemasons Category:History of Algeria Category:Kings and queens Category:Recipients of the Order of the Legion of Honour Category:Mystics Category:National liberation movements Category:Sufis Category:Sultans Category:Heads of state in Africa",
