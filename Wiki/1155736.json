It started on April 23, 2025, in Mexico City and will end on December 7, 2025, in Abu Dhabi. The tour includes 84 shows and is her first tour in seven years, since Witness: The Tour. ==Announcements== On September 25, 2024, Katy Perry announced on the Australian show Sunrise that she would be going on the Lifetimes Tour, starting with five shows in Australia. Pre-sale and general sale info came out the same day. Due to high demand, extra shows were added in Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide soon after. More shows in Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide were added on October 3. On November 11, she announced shows in South America, including Chile and Argentina. More shows were added in Brazil and Mexico after the first ones sold out. UK shows were announced on November 17, with £1 from each ticket going to the Music Venue Trust. A second London show and concerts in Canada were added soon after, along with an extra show in Buenos Aires. On December 9, European dates were announced. Paris got extra shows due to demand, and new stops were added in Bologna (Italy), Munich (Germany), Lyon (France), and Belfast (Northern Ireland), which later got a second show. She also added a show in Hanover, Germany, and final Australian dates. In early 2025, Perry announced shows in Spain and the U.S., plus a second Toronto date. On March 9, it was revealed that Rebecca Black would join as a supporting act. In April, during a flight to space, Perry revealed the tour setlist. That same day, she announced two concerts in Hangzhou, China, and that Mexican DJ Mariana BO and the band Midnight Generation would open the Mexico shows. == Set list == # \"Artificial\" # \"Chained to the Rhythm\" # \"Teary Eyes\" # \"Dark Horse\" # \"Woman's World\" # \"California Gurls\" # \"Teenage Dream\" # \"Hot n Cold\" # \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" # \"I Kissed a Girl\" # \"Nirvana\" # \"Crush\" # \"I'm His, He's Mine\" # \"Wide Awake\" # \"Choose Your Own Adventure (song chosen by public)\" # \"Choose Your Own Adventure (song chosen by public)\" # \"All the Love\" # \"E.T.\" # \"Part of Me\" # \"Rise\" # \"Roar\" # \"Daisies\" # \"Lifetimes\" # \"Firework\" (with elements of \"Wonder\") == Tour dates == List of 2025 concerts Date (2025) City Country Venue Supporting acts Attendance Revenue April 23 Mexico City Mexico Arena CDMX Mariana BO — — April 25 April 26 Midnight Generation April 28 Monterrey Arena Monterrey Mariana BO — — April 29 May 7 Houston United States Toyota Center Rebecca Black — — May 9 Oklahoma City Paycom Center — — May 10 Kansas City T-Mobile Center — — May 12 Chicago United Center — — May 13 Minneapolis Target Center — — May 15 Denver Ball Arena — — May 17 Paradise T-Mobile Arena — — May 20 Austin Moody Center — — May 21 Dallas American Airlines Center — — June 4 Sydney Australia Qudos Bank Arena rowspan=\"15\" — — June 7 Melbourne Rod Laver Arena — — June 9 Sydney Qudos Bank Arena — — June 10 June 12 Melbourne Rod Laver Arena — — June 13 June 14 June 17 Brisbane Brisbane Entertainment Centre — — June 18 June 22 Perth RAC Arena — — June 23 June 26 Adelaide Adelaide Entertainment Centre — — June 27 June 29 June 30 July 12 Phoenix United States PHX Arena Rebecca Black — — July 13 Anaheim Honda Center — — July 15 Inglewood Kia Forum — — July 18 San Francisco Chase Center — — July 21 Seattle Climate Pledge Arena — — July 22 Vancouver Canada Rogers Arena — — July 24 Edmonton Rogers Place — — July 26 Winnipeg Canada Life Centre — — July 29 Ottawa Canadian Tire Centre — — July 30 Montreal Bell Centre — — August 1 Quebec City Centre Videotron rowspan=\"2\" — — August 3 Detroit United States Little Caesars Arena — — August 5 Toronto Canada Scotiabank Arena Rebecca Black — — August 6 August 8 Boston United States TD Garden — — August 9 Philadelphia Wells Fargo Center — — August 11 New York City Madison Square Garden — — August 14 Newark Prudential Center — — August 15 Baltimore CFG Bank Arena — — August 17 Raleigh Lenovo Center — — August 19 Nashville Bridgestone Arena — — August 20 Atlanta State Farm Arena — — August 22 Tampa Amalie Arena — — August 23 Miami Kaseya Center — — September 6 Santiago Chile Estadio Bicentenario de La Florida rowspan=\"31\" — — September 9 Buenos Aires Argentina Movistar Arena — — September 10 September 14 São Paulo Brazil Interlagos Circuit October 4 Belfast Northern Ireland SSE Arena — — October 5 October 7 Glasgow Scotland OVO Hydro — — October 8 Manchester England AO Arena — — October 10 Sheffield Utilita Arena — — October 11 Birmingham Utilita Arena — — October 13 London The O2 Arena — — October 14 — — October 16 Antwerp Belgium Sportpaleis — — October 17 Hanover Germany ZAG- Arena — — October 19 Copenhagen Denmark Royal Arena — — October 21 Berlin Germany Uber Arena — — October 23 Cologne Lanxess Arena — — October 24 Paris France Accor Arena — — October 27 Budapest Hungary MVM Dome — — October 28 Kraków Poland Tauron Arena — — October 30 Prague Czech Republic O2 Arena — — October 31 Munich Germany Olympiahalle — — November 2 Casalecchio di Reno Italy Unipol Arena — — November 4 Paris France Accor Arena — — November 5 November 7 Décines-Charpieu LDLC Arena — — November 9 Barcelona Spain Palau Sant Jordi — — November 11 Madrid Movistar Arena — — November 21 Hangzhou China Hangzhou Olympic Expo Center — — November 22 — — December 7 Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates Etihad Park — — Total — — ===Canceled shows=== List of canceled concerts Date (2025) City Country Venue Reason May 1 Guadalajara Mexico Arena Guadalajara Unfinished venue May 2 == References == Category:2025 concert tours Category:Concert tours of Mexico Category:Concert tours of Australia Category:Concert tours of Canada Category:Concert tours of Chile Category:Concert tours of Argentina Category:Concert tours of the United Kingdom Category:Concert tours of Belgium Category:Concert tours of Denmark Category:Concert tours of Germany Category:Concert tours of France Category:Concert tours of Hungary Category:Concert tours of Poland Category:Concert tours of the Czech Republic Category:Katy Perry concert tours Category:Upcoming concert tours",
