She is the goddess of household, hearth, family, fireplace, kitchen, wealth, peace and prosperity. She is frequently associated with Leimarel Sidabi. She is regarded as one of the incarnations or representations of goddess Leimarel Sidabi. The personality of Emoinu and other goddesses like Panthoibi and Phouoibi depict as well as influence the boldness, courage, independence, righteousness and social honour of Meitei women. == Name == The meaning of the name \"Emoinu Ahongbi\" (\"ꯏꯃꯣꯢꯅꯨ ꯑꯍꯣꯡꯕꯤ\") can be found by splitting it up word by word. Here, \"E\" (\"ꯏ\") refers to human being. \"Moi\" (\"ꯃꯣꯢ\" or \"ꯃꯣꯏ\") refers to rearing. \"Nu\" (\"ꯅꯨ\") refers to female deity or goddess. So, \"Emoinu\" means goddess who rears the human beings. \"Ahongbi\" means giver of plentiful household properties. == Description == Dr. Parratt described Emoinu Ahongbi (alias Emoinu Ahong Achaubi) as another form of Goddess Leimarel Sidabi. Leimarel Sidabi is the supreme mother. Imoinu is regarded as an ever resourceful lady. She always gives wealth and prosperity to the mankind. She was shown as having a human appearance. She resides near the fire hearth. The goddess is believed to be the controller and regulator of good conduct and behavior of the human beings. Imoinu Ahong Achaubi is a deity for good moral behavior, besides wealth and prosperity. As a social code of conduct, a Meitei woman should go out from home only after prayers and worship of the goddess and other household deities. When she returns home, she should pray to the deity. The Meitei people believed that goddess Imoinu lives in the houses of those who strictly obey her favorite social and moral behavior norms. Imoinu blesses such people with nungai yaifaba (well-being and prosperity), watta padaba (having neither shortage nor excess), tekta kaidaba (unaffected by troubles of life) and punshi nungshangba (long life). These are the basic needs of life in the human world. == Mythology == === Origin === After the creation of the sky and the planets, Sidaba () (the Supreme Being) ordered His wife, Leimarel Sidabi () (the first woman) to produce another Leimarel.

She created another Leimarel. The appearance of the second Leimarel was similar to the first Leimarel. The first Leimarel named the second Leimarel as \"Emoinu Ahongbi\". === Lover === Once goddess Imoinu fell in love with a man. The two became lovers. They swore to be husband and wife.
