 "text": "The 2019–2020 Peruvian constitutional crisis began when President Martín Vizcarra dissolved the Congress of Peru on 30 September 2019. Congress responded by declaring Vizcarra's presidency suspended and appointed Vice President Mercedes Aráoz as interim president, moves that were largely seen as null and void. The next day, on 1 October 2019, Aráoz announced her resignation while Vizcarra issued a decree for legislative elections to be held on 26 January 2020. ==References== Category:2020 in Peru Category:September 2019 events Category:October 2019 events Category:November 2019 events Category:December 2019 events Category:January 2020 events",
