 "text": "Maximilian II (31 July 1527 – 12 October 1576) was Holy Roman Emperor from 1564 until his death. A member of the House of Habsburg, he became King of Bohemia in 1562, King of Germany in 1562, and King of Hungary and King of Croatia in 1563. He succeeded his father Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor in 1564. Maximilian's reign was shaped by religious tensions following the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, as he tried to ease conflicts between Catholic and Lutheran groups but ultimately failed.Fichtner, Paula Sutter. Emperor Maximilian II. Yale University Press, 2001. He also dealt with ongoing threats from the Ottoman Empire and faced conflicts with his Spanish relatives. Born in Vienna, Maximilian was the son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anne of Bohemia and Hungary. Educated by humanist scholars, he gained military experience in the Italian War of 1542–46 and the Schmalkaldic War. In 1548, he married Maria of Spain, strengthening ties with Spain. Despite his Catholic background, Maximilian had Lutheran influences, causing concerns within the Catholic Church.Marshall, Peter. The Mercurial Emperor: The Magic Circle of Rudolf II in Renaissance Prague. Yale University Press, 2013, pp. 10–12. He focused on defending his lands and developing Vienna, overseeing the construction of important buildings like the Hofburg Palace and Neugebäude Palace. ==References== Category:1527 births Category:1576 deaths Category:Holy Roman Emperors Category:Habsburg Dynasty Category:History of Germany Category:History of Hungary",
