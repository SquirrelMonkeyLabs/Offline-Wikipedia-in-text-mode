 "text": "Apadana is a large hypostyle hall. It generally refers to two palaces built by Darius the Great. One is in Susa, and the other is in Persepolis, both in modern day Iran. Sources say they are of \"similar dimensions and floor plans\", and are around 10,000 sq. meters.https://www.worldhistory.org/image/10553/the- apadana-of-the-palace-of-darius-in-susa/ Both Apadanas had 36 columns in their main halls, which were 60x60 meters, with 36 more flanking the main hall on three sides, for 72 total (maps of Persepolis and Susa confirm the Apadanas have similar floor plans).https://smarthistory.org/persepolis-the-audience- hall-of-darius-and-xerxes/https://www.livius.org/articles/place/susa/susa- photos/susa-palace-of-darius-the-great/ ==References== Category:5th-century BC buildings and structures Category:Buildings and structures in Iran Category:Establishments in Iran",
