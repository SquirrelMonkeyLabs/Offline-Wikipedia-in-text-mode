He is also the President of Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N). He is the brother of Nawaz Sharif, former Prime Minister of Pakistan. He is the chief minister of Pakistan's most populous province Punjab since 2008. Previously, he held this position from 1997 to 1999, when Pervez Musharraf took control of Pakistan in a military coup. He, along with his entire family, was forced into exile until his return to Pakistan in late 2007. On 29 July 2017, Sharif was named as the Prime Minister of Pakistan following the resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after Panama Papers case decision. After Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was elected Prime Minister of Pakistan, it was reported that he was likely to continue as Prime Minister for next ten months until 2018 general election, however Nasirul Mulk was selected. He ran for the office in the 2018 election, but controversially Imran Khan was elected Prime Minister. After Imran Khan was removed from office by a motion of no confidence on 10 April 2022, Shahbaz was elected prime minister the next day. On 12 August 2023, the parliament was set to expire due to the completion of the 5 year tenure. However, to gain more time for elections and other political gains, Sharif and the PDM alliance agreed to dissolve the parliament on 9 August 2023 which was approved by the President of Pakistan. On 3 March 2024, he was re-elected Prime Minister of Pakistan for a second term, receiving 201 votes to 92 votes for the PTI-backed Omar Ayub Khan. == References == Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Prime ministers of Pakistan Category:Pakistani Muslims Category:Politicians from Lahore",
