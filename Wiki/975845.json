The lyrics were written by Louis Notari and the music was composed by Charles Albrecht. ==Lyrics== Monégasque lyrics IPA transcription French translation English translation Forever, in our land, One flag has flown in the wind Forever, the colours red and white Have symbolised our liberty Adults and children have always respected them. We have perpetuated the same traditions; We celebrate the same religion; We have the honour To have always had the same Princes. And nothing will change As long as the sun shines; God will always help us And nothing will change. ==References== Category:European anthems Category:National symbols of Monaco",
