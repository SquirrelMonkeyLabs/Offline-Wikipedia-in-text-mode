 "text": "In comics, a script is the words the characters say and also what they think which is shown on the page as thought bubbles. Usually, a comic is made by two people. The one who writes it and the one who draws it. The one who draws it is called a comic book artist or illustrator The one who writes it is called the Scriptwriter or the writer. == Examples == When Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created Superman, Siegel wrote the scripts while Shuster drew the comics. When Bob Kane and Bill Finger created Batman, Kane drew the comics but Finger wrote the scripts. When Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created Captain America, Kirby drew everything and Simon wrote the scripts. When Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, Ditko drew everything and Lee wrote the scripts. Sometimes, the same person who draws the comic book art also writes the script.
