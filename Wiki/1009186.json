The company was founded in 1947 in the city of Annecy by François Salomon. At first, the company produced ski edges in a small workshop with only François' wife and son, Georges, to help. Georges Salomon later played an important role in the company's evolution towards becoming a worldwide outdoor sports brand. Today, Salomon is a major company in the sports equipment industry. Its products are sold in over 40 countries across five continents. Salomon's product line includes running shoes, hiking boots, ski and snowboard equipment, clothing, and accessories. Salomon is also well-known for sponsoring and hosting many trail races throughout the world, including the Golden Trail Series. The company also operates Salomon TV, a channel that tells inspirational stories about athletes, places, and interesting characters from the world of skiing, trail running, and the outdoors. In 2019, Salomon became part of Amer Sports, a Finnish company that specializes in producing sports equipment. Amer Sports owns other brands such as Wilson, Atomic, Precor, and Arc'teryx.
