 "text": "eLife is a scientific journal for the biomedical and life sciences. It is open access. It was established at the end of 2012 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Max Planck Society, and Wellcome Trust. These organizations gave the money for the journal's business and publishing operations. The editor-in- chief is Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley). Editorial decisions are made largely by senior editors and members of the board of reviewing editors. These are all people who work as scientists. They are in many fields, including human genetics, neuroscience, biophysics, and epidemiology. eLife used to be a normal peer-reviewed journal. In 2021, it stopped using the peer review process that most journals use. At present, it will publish all articles that are reviewed, and not reject any. ==Business model== The journal charges authors USD$2,500 for their papers to be published in the journal. It started doing this in 2017. ==Abstracting and indexing== The journal is indexed in Medline, BIOSIS Previews, Chemical Abstracts Service, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Scopus. In 2016, the journal had an impact factor of 7.725. The journal claims that it will not advertise its impact factor. ==eLife digests== Most articles in the journal have an \"eLife digest\". This is a short version of the article for people who aren't scientists. Since December 2014, the journal has been sharing some of the digests on Medium. == References == == Other websites == * * eLife on Medium Category:Science and technology magazines",
