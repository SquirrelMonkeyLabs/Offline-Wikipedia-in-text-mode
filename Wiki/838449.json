It was renamed Red October in 1922. The Misha bear chocolate bear is one of the chocolates made at Red October. The Misha bear shows Russian national pride. The candy bear looks like paintings of brown bears by artist Ivan Shishkin. The factory started making Alyonka chocolate bars in 1966. Alyonka is the name of the fictional girl on the package. In 2007, the factory had 3000 workers. The factory owners moved the factory out of central Moscow to a place outside the city. They moved the factory because the real estate in the middle of the city had become very valuable. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Russia Category:Moscow",
