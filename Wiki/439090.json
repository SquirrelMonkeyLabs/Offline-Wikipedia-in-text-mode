 "text": "Home Alone 4 (also known as Home Alone: Taking Back the House) is an American family criminal comedy television movie. It first aired on ABC on November 3, 2002. Home Alone 4 was directed by Rod Daniel and is the fourth movie in the Home Alone movie series. The movie has some of the main characters from the first two movies, but all of the roles are played by different actors. The story is in Chicago, but the movie was actually filmed in South Africa. The movie was not very popular. A planned TV series based on the movie was canceled because of the poor reviews. It is a reboot of the Home Alone franchise. In the film, Kevin (Mike Weinberg) gets upset when he hears his parents, Peter and Kate McCalister (Jason Beghe and Clare Carey) will get divorced. He is forced to choose where to celebrate Christmas, at his house or at his dad and his new wife, Natalie's (Joanna Going) mansion. Begrudgingly, he chooses to spend it at Natalie's mansion. However, when he gets there, he has to protect the house from his old nemesis Marv (French Stewart) and his wife/sidekick, Vera (Missi Pyle). ==Other websites== * Category:2002 movies Category:2000s criminal comedy movies Category:American criminal comedy movies Category:American family movies Category:American television movies Category:Christmas movies Category:Sequel movies Category:Movies set in Chicago Category:Movies directed by Rod Daniel",
