 "text": "A chuj is a traditional Mayan bathhouse. It is a sweat bath or steam bath. Traditional chuj had stone walls and live sod roofs. This means the roof was made of earth or soil and had plants growing on it. Today, some chuj are made out of cinder blocks instead. Each family would build their own chuj near their house out of stone or adobe bricks. The chuj has no windows. Inside, the people heat rocks until they are hot. Then they throw water onto the rocks to make steam. The bathers lie down on wooden beds in the hut. The traditional belief is that the chuj cleans the body and also the spirit and mind. ==References== Category:Hygiene Category:Guatemala",
