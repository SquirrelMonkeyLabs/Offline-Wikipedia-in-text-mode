Its population in 2024 was 328. == Location == It is located on the left bank of the Hernád River, between Hernádbűd and Felsődobsza, 38 kilometers northeast of Miskolc, the county seat. == History == The settlement on the banks of the Hernád was first mentioned in 1282 as part of the Bárca clan’s estate. The Turks did not occupy it for a long time because the Hernád provided a natural defensive line, but in 1640, the village came under Turkish rule. The population fled multiple times during the Turkish era. Its landowners, the Bárczay family, repopulated it with Slovaks. The Bárczay family also built the castle around 1830. == Population == In 2022, 95.5% of the population identified as Hungarian, 21.1% as Roma, 0.3% each as Ukrainian, Serbian, and Romanian, and 1% as belonging to other non-domestic nationalities (4.5% did not declare; due to dual identities, the total may exceed 100%).
