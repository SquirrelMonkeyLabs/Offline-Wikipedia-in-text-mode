He was charged with violating paragraph 147a of the Norwegian Criminal Code, which is \"destabilising or destroying basic functions of society\" and \"creating serious fear in the population\", acts of terrorism under the criminal law and ordered held for eight weeks; the first four in solitary confinement which was pending further court proceedings. Breivik has sued Norway; he won part of his lawsuit in the district court in 2016, but lost in the higher courts in 2017; he has formally asked European Court of Human Rights, if that court can try his case against Norway. Breivik was born and raised in Oslo. Breivik failed to develop a stable and safe identity when he was at schools, and the places where he worked, and on internet forums about politics, and in the world of gaming, and as a result he turned the defeats, shame, and hate, towards society, said Svein Østerud (no:) professor emeritus.Svein Østerud. \"Når 22. juli skal filmes\" [when the Norway Attacks (or 22 July) will be filmed] (18 July 2017) Klassekampen. p. 22 In Norway, as of 2017, Breivik has become [, to a degree,] \"the person whose name shall not be mentioned\", claimed an article in Dagsavisen; furthermore, if Norway [wishes] to fight against what he stood for, then one must study \"step by step\" why [the attacks] happened, in the same way we study how, kind doctors in another country, became able to kill mentally disabled, Jews, and persons who had Schizophrenia. ==Religious and political views== Breivik converted [or changed his religion, faith or belief,] to Nazism, while in prison, his lawyer Øystein Storrvik(no:) said in 2016.

In 2017, blogger and author \"Fjordman\" (real name: Peder Are Nøstvold Jensen) gave his opinion about texts written by Breivik (in the compilation and in letters from prison): Breivik appears to have psychiatric problems.Peder Are Nøstvold Jensen. ==Health== He has been diagnosed with personality disorders: antisocial and narcissistic, media said in 2012.
