 "text": "Pane sciocco (also called in Tuscany \"pane toscano\") is a variety of bread very common in Tuscany and in Umbria, two regions in Italy. Pane sciocco does not contain salt, because when it was first made in the 1600s, salt was very rare and very expensive. Pane sciocco is often eaten with typically Tuscan ham or sausages, famous for being salty. ==Related pages== *Tuscan food Category:Italian food Category:Breads",
