 "text": "The Welsh Parliament (), commonly shortened to Senedd, is the devolved parliament with the power to make devolved laws in Wales. Between 1999 and 2020, it had the name National Assembly for Wales; commonly shortened to Welsh Assembly. == History == The Assembly was created after the Government of Wales Act 1998 law, which was introduced after a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to make primary legislation until the Government of Wales Act 2006 law, which gave the Assembly limited powers to make laws. Its powers were increased again after a Yes vote in a referendum on 3 March 2011, which allowed the Assembly to make laws without having to make a request to the Parliament of the UK, or to the Secretary of State for Wales. == How it works == The Senedd has 60 members, called Members of the Senedd, or MSs for short. In Welsh, they are called Aelod o'r Senedd. Members of the Senedd are elected for 4 years in an additional members system - 40 AMs are elected by the plurality system, and represent the different areas of Wales. Another 20 AMs from 5 electoral regions are also elected, by the proportional representation system. == Related pages == * Welsh Government == References == Category:Devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom Category:Politics of Wales Category:1998 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1990s establishments in Wales Category:Organisations based in Cardiff Category:Unicameral legislatures Category:Welsh Government",
