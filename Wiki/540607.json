 "text": "Daniel Joseph Berrigan, S.J. (May 9, 1921 â€“ April 30, 2016), was an American Jesuit priest, anti-war activist, and poet. He moved to Syracuse, New York at age five. He was known for protesting against the Vietnam War during the 1970s. It also landed him on the FBI's \"most wanted list\", on the cover of TIME magazine, and in prison. In 1980, he founded the Plowshares Movement, an anti-nuclear protest group, that put him back into the national spotlight. Berrigan died on April 30, 2016 in The Bronx, New York City after a long- illness, aged 94. == Related pages == *List of poets from North America ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American activists Category:Educators from Minnesota Category:American poets Category:Writers from Syracuse, New York Category:Writers from Minnesota Category:Academics from Syracuse, New York",
