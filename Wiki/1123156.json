 "text": "The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet is a way to write the Romanian language that was used in the Soviet Union. It was officially used from 1924 to 1932 and from 1938 to 1989. It is still used today in the region of Transnistria. ==History== Before the 19th century, Romanian was written with a version of the Cyrillic alphabet. In the 19th century, Romania switched to a Latin alphabet. However, the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet was created in the 1920s for the Moldavian ASSR. This was to make Moldovan different from Romanian. It was replaced by a Latin alphabet in 1932 but brought back in 1938. After the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, it was used in the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1989 when it switched back to the Latin alphabet. Today, Transnistria still uses the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet for official documents. ==Description== The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet is mostly like the Russian alphabet, but it does not have the letters Ё, Щ, and Ъ. It also has the letter zhe with breve: Ӂ ӂ.
