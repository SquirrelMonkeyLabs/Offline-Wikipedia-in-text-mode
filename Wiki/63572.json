 "text": "Retirement is when people stop working. People may retire when they reach a certain age, or if they get sick or have an accident, or even for their own choice. People cannot generally retire unless they have a pension. Some people may semi-retire and keep some sort of job. People typically do this after working for so many years and growing tired of it. People who become less able to look after themselves may move to retirement homes, retirement villages, sheltered housing, or nursing homes. They may have to pay for care,or their family may care for them. ==Retirement in other uses== The term may also be used when it's not related to people. This can maybe used for when something is out of service, like an old model vehicle. ==References== ==Other websites== * Wiktionary term about this word Category:Old age",
