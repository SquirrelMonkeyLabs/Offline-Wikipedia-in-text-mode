 "text": "The 1939-40 Austrian football championship (Gauliga Ostmark also Fußball- Sportbereichsklasse Ostmark 1940/41) was the third season of the Gauliga Ostmark in annexed Austria. ==General informations== Rapid Wien became champions of the Gauliga for the second time in a row and Austrian champions for the 14th time. With this victory, Rapid qualified for the 1940/41 German football championship. They made it into the final. On 22 June 1941 in front of almost 100,000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin they played against FC Schalke 04. They won 4-3 and were German champion. The two bottom- placed teams from the Gauliga were Grazer SC (Styria) and Linzer ASK (Upper Donau). They were relegated. Promotion and relegation, which had been suspended in 1939, was reintroduced for 1940/41. After the end of the war, each club was put into the league that it held in August 1939 - before the start of the war. ==Table== Pl. Name M W D L P 1\\. SK Rapid Wien 18 12 4 2 28 2\\.
