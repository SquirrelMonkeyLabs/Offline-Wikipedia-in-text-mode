 "text": "Ammonium sulfate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is (NH4)2SO4. It contains ammonium and sulfate ions. It is slightly acidic because ammonia is a weak base. It is made by reacting ammonia with sulfuric acid. It breaks down when heated. It is used in fertilizers to provide both sulfur and nitrogen to plants. The ammoniacal nitrogen of ammonium sulfate does not leach out easily. Ammonium sulfate is an acid forming fertilizer, and hence used in neutral or alkaline soils. It rarely occurs in the ground. == References == == Related pages == *Sodium sulfate *Sulfite *Potassium sulfate Category:Sulfates Category:Ammonium salts",
