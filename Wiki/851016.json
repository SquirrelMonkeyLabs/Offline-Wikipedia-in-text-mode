 "text": "The Hirzai Horse is a rare breed of riding horse originating from Pakistan. These horses are of Arab origin, during the Umayyad Caliphate Dynasty; and have ample resemblance to Balochis. Home tract lies in Balochistan province. Their size is intermediate between those of a horse and a pony. Thoroughbred stallions provided by the Balochistan Government at important centres such as Quetta and Sibi are instrumental in large scale crossbreeding with native mares. The objective is to improve the native stock, however, this policy has led to the deterioration of native breeds purity. Good specimens of Balochi and Hirzai breeds are available at Sibi and Nasirabad Horse shows. Certain measures are currently being taken by the Pakistani state to protect and propagate this rare horse breed. They are a light riding horse developed by the Department of Agriculture in Pakistan. Offspring of the original two were then crossed with lighter desert breeds. Currently measures are being taken by the Pakistan government to protect and further this rare horse breed. The majority of the animals that exist today are kept at the royal stables of Khan of Kalat. == Personality and Temperament == The Hirzai is a lively horse capable of hard and fast work. == Care == Because it is now considered a rare breed, the Hirzai requires extra attention and special. == Traditional colours == Nukra means a horse with white hair and pink skin. At times, there are spots on the skin (locally called as phulkari). Genetically speaking, it is a double Sabino (two copies of SB1) gene, resulting in maximally expressed white. Since the horse has white hair, pink skin and mostly dark brown eyes, you can rule out Albinism. == Use == Riding horse, Light draft. == In popular culture == The Nukra horse is the national horse of Pakistan. It is the official Islamic symbol of the Pakistani culture in the region respectively. This horse is very important in Pakistani culture. They appear in Islamic literature and are on items such as postage stamps. They have been depicted in Lollywood Pakistani movies. There are also Melas or horse shows where they perform dancing by Pakistani man handling. Category:Horse breeds Category:Animals of Pakistan",
