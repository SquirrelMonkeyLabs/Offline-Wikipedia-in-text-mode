 "text": "Wood grain describes the , and appearance of the wood . This is often important in its effect on woodworking techniques (e.g. against the grain). In describing the alignment of the wood in the tree a distinction may be made. Basic grain descriptions and types include: * straight - grain which runs in a single direction along the cut wood, a product of a straight growing tree * cross - grain in which some cells grow out from the major growth axis of the tree * spiral - grain which develops as the trunk of the tree twists in development * interlocked (roey grain) A step beyond spiral grain occurring when growth rings in a twisting trunk develop misaligned grain In addition, there are a few special grain alignments. Their rarity often promotes the value of both the raw material, and the finished work it becomes a part of. These include: * bird's eye * quilted * fiddleback * curly * tiger In describing the application of a woodworking technique to a given piece of wood, the direction of the technique might be: * with the grain * against the grain * across the grain In a wider sense, the term grain may also be applied to the orientation of the cut, the way a given piece of wood has been sawn: * flat-grain: flat-sawn or plain sawn, * edge grain: quarter-sawn or rift-sawn or straight-grained, and * end grain.
