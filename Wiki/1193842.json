 "text": "The Blatten landslide, sometimes called the Blatten glacier collapse, is a natural disaster that occurred on May 28, 2025. The landslide destroyed most of the village of Blatten in the Lötschental in the canton of Valais in Switzerland. The landslide was an avalanche, made of debris and ice. A glacier in the area of the Bietschhorn had collapsed and caused the landslide. Monitoring equipment was in place, which allowed to evacuate the village on May 19, about 10 days before the desaster. One person was first reported missing, but he likely died. == References == * Theodor Hügi, Hugo Ledermann, Ernst Schläppi: Sheet 1268 Lötschental (Atlas Sheet 82) – Explanations.
