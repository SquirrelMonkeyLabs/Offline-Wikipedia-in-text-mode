When she was a student at Columbia University she made a documentary called Columbia Unbecoming which accused several professors of anti-Semitism because of their comments about Israel. For several years Weiss worked as a journalist at the New York Times. Weiss caused a lot of controversy when she interviewed Bret Weinstein, said that Aziz Ansari wasn’t actually guilty of sexual assault defended Brett Kavanaugh when he was accused of rape complained that people who supported left-wing politics were too quick to accuse other people of fascism and promoted the Intellectual dark web. Weiss later said she had gone through a lot of bullying, harassment and anti-Semitism when at the New York Times since she didn’t agree with everything that they said so she quit. Since then Weiss started her own substack called The Free Press. Weiss wrote a book on how to resist anti-Semitism. Weiss is in a lesbian marriage to Nellie Bowles.
