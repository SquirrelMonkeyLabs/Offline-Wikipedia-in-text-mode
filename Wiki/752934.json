It is the world's first iron-framed building. It is also seen as the world's first skyscraper, often being described as \"the grandfather of skyscrapers\", despite it being only as tall as a modern-day five-storey building. In the 1950s, it became a Grade I listed building. The site is owned by of Historic England. ==Construction== Its architect was Charles Bage, who designed the mill using an iron-framed structure, inspired by the work of William Strutt.
