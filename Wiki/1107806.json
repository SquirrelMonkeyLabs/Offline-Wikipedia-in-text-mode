 "text": "The Second Chechen War was a war between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and Russia from 1999 to 2009. == Prelude to War == === Dagestan === On August 7 1999, Mujahideen forces, mostly made up of Chechens, invaded the Republic of Dagestan. === Russian Apartment Bombings === In September 1999, a series of bombings occurred in multiple apartment blocks in Russia killing more than 300 people, and injuring more than 1000. The bombings were used in order to justify the leading invasion of Chechnya by Russian forces. == Invasion == === Initial Offensive === Russian troops entered Chechnya in October 1999. Heavy fighting would last until April 2000, with Grozny being captured by Russia on February 2000. == Insurgency == === Guerilla War === Chechen rebels fled deeper into the country side, resorting to using guerilla tactics in order to fight against Russia. This guerilla stage would last until 2009 when counter- terrorism operations in Chechnya finally ended. == Terrorism == === Continued Terrorism === Even with most resistance ceasing activity, terrorism still plagues Chechnya and the rest of the Caucasus to the modern day. Many jihadist groups arose during the Second Chechen War committing multiple acts of terrorism such as the Moscow theater hostage crisis, the Beslan school siege, and more recently, the Crocus City Hall attack. == References == Category:1990s in Russia Category:Conflicts in 1999 Category:2000s conflicts Category:Wars of independence Category:Chechnya Category:Wars involving Russia",
