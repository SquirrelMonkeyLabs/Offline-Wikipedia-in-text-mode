He was the leader of the militant Islamist organization al-Qaeda. Ayman al-Zawahiri was member of Islamist organizations which have organised and carried out attacks in North America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2012 he called on fellow Muslims to kidnap western tourists in Muslim countries. Since the September 11 attacks until his death, U.S. State Department offered a US$25 million reward for information leading to al-Zawahiri's arrest. He was under worldwide sanctions by the United Nations Security Council 1267 Committee as a member or affiliate of al-Qaeda. In 1998 Ayman made a religious ruling alongside 3 other scholars encouraging jihad against the US and its allies. Ayman also asked to attack american and ally millitary base. ==Early life== Al-Zawahiri studied medicine in Cairo. He successfully completed his studies in 1974. He worked as a surgeon for three years in the Egyptian army. After that, he worked in a hospital in Cairo. In 1980 and 1981, al-Zawahiri travelled to Pakistan to help the Red Crescent movement. In 1986, he met Osama bin Laden and he became closely associated with him. In 1988, bin Laden would go on to establish the al-Qaeda organization network and al-Zawahiri served as his second-in-command. Both men were based in Afghanistan at this time and al-Zawahiri held a significant sway over the organization's operations abroad. Al-Zawahiri is the author of several works, including numerous al-Qaeda statements. He spoke Arabic, English, and French. == Death == Al-Zawahiri was killed on July 31, 2022 shortly after 6:00 AM local time (9:00 PM Eastern Time), in an early-morning drone strike by the Central Intelligence Agency. Since this was a specialized attack, there were no other casualties except al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri was living in a friend's house in Kabul, Afghanistan, which was where the drone struck. He was 71 years old. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1951 births Category:2022 deaths Category:al-Qaeda people Category:Egyptian Muslims Category:Egyptian scientists Category:People from Cairo Category:Physicians Category:Cairo University alumni Category:Deaths by airstrike",
