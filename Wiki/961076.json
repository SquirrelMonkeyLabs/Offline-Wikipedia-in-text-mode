 "text": "Lysapsus is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. These frogs live in South America. They live east of the Andes. They are called harlequin frogs in English. Many frogs in Lysapsus are larger when they are tadpoles than when they are adult frogs. ==Species== There are four species: * Lysapsus bolivianus (Gallardo, 1961) * Lysapsus caraya (Gallardo, 1964) * Lysapsus laevis (Parker, 1935) * Lysapsus limellum (Cope, 1862) Scientists believe Lysapsus bolivianus may be its own species or a subspecies of Lysapsus limellum. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
