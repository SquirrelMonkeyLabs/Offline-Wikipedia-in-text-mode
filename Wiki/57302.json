 "text": "Hodgkin lymphoma, also known as Hodgkin's disease, is a type of lymphoma. It was first discovered by Thomas Hodgkin in 1832. It is one of many kinds of cancers of the lymphatic system. Most of the time, the cancer grows in a lymph node before it spreads to the rest of the body. The symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma change as the disease progresses. At the first stage of the disease, the person may feel a lump on the affected lymph node that does not hurt when touched. The person may have fevers, sweat at night, and itchy skin. In the later stages of the disease, the person may feel very tired and their spleen may grow larger. Category:Cancer Category:Diseases caused by viruses",
