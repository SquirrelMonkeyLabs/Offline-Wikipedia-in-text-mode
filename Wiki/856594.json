 "text": "After the so-called Pakistan Civil War (1971), Act Number 9 of 1973 (called The Bangladesh Passport Order, 1973) which was signed into effect by the President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on 8 February 1973, this led to the creation and issuing of the first passport of a newly separatist Bangladesh. These passport booklets were traditional, handwritten or manual, passports and were compliant with the relevant international laws and regulations in force at the time. Subsequently, additional laws were enacted in Bangladesh in the years that followed to improve the passport application process; enforce the ineligibility to hold multiple valid Bangladeshi passports; citizenship requirement for a passport; etc. Since 1972 a special passport, also known as the India-Bangladesh Special Passport, used to be issued to Bangladeshi citizens and Indian nationals resident in West Bengal State and the North-Eastern States of India only. ==Physical appearance== Bangladeshi passport covers are dark green, with the Seal of the Government of Bangladesh emblazoned in gold in the centre of the front cover.
