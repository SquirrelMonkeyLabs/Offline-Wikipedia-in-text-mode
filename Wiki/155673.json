 "text": "The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) is a tropical member of the family Phasianidae. They are the ancestors of all our domestic chickens. They were first domesticated in Asia, where they are native. Some of the less specialized domestics, such as the brown leghorns, keep color patterns similar to that of their wild ancestors. The males are about two pounds (1kg) in weight. == Bathing == Red junglefowl regularly bathe in dust to keep just the right balance of oil in their plumage. The dust absorbs extra oil and it subsequently falls off. == References == Category:Phasianidae Category:Birds of Asia",
