 "text": "The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA; Spanish: Acuerdo Estados Unidos-México-Canadá, AEUMC; French: Accord États-Unis-Mexique-Canada, AÉUMC) is a free trade agreement between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, replacing the previous North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It is the result of the 2017–2018 renegotiation of NAFTA by its member states, which informally agreed to the terms on September 30, 2018, and formally on October 1. The agreement came into effect on July 1, 2020. Compared to NAFTA, the agreement gives the U.S. more access to Canada's $19 billion dairy market, more domestic production of cars and trucks, increases environmental and labor regulations, and introduces updated intellectual property protections. ==References== Category:October 2018 events Category:September 2018 events Category:2018 in the United States Category:2018 in Canada Category:2018 in Mexico Category:Economy of Canada Category:Economy of Mexico Category:Economy of the United States Category:International organizations",
