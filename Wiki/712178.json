 "text": "In classical mathematics, analytic geometry, also known as coordinate geometry or Cartesian geometry, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system, usually the Cartesian coordinate system. As vectors are frequently used, it is also known as vector geometry. In most cases, tools from algebra (especially linear algebra) are used to solve problems. Category:Fields of geometry",
