Reportedly she was born in 28 September 1989. Her family is reportedly of the political elite; her mother is said to be the head of a gynecology ward and her father is a professor. She is also said to be related to Ri Pyong-chol, a former anti-air force general of the Korean People's Army and a close advisor to Kim Jong-un. It is said that North Korean officials are trying to erase her past as a singer by removing popular bootleg CDs of her performances. Ri is reportedly a graduate student from Kim Il-sung University, pursing a PhD in science. Ri reportedly visited South Korea in 2005, as a member of a North Korean cheerleading team during the Asian Athletic Championships. === Marriage and family === Kim Jong-il had quickly arranged and ordered Ri Sol-ju to get married to his son, Kim Jong-un after suffering a stroke in 2008. They both got married in 2009, although the marriage date is unknown. She possibly gave birth to a boy in 2010. In December 2012, it was said that Ri was visibly pregnant, although North Korean officials did not confirm anything. In 2013, American basketball player, Dennis Rodman had visited North Korea to meet Kim and told The Guardian in September 2013 that she had gave birth to a girl named “Kim Ju-ae”.\"Dennis Rodman's slip gives away name of North Korean leader's baby\" , The Guardian.
