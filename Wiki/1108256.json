It is different from simmering or boiling as simmering and boiling use high temperature water. The method creates a softer egg compared to cooking an egg in higher temperature water. Some critics of the method say that poaching an egg could lead to diseases like salmonella . However, many have also praised poached eggs as a healthier alternative to fried eggs with their soft texture and are more nutritious then hard boiled eggs. == References == Category:Egg dishes",
