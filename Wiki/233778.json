 "text": "E major is a major scale with a base note of E. Its key signature has four sharps. It has the pitches of E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, D♯, and E. Its relative minor is C-sharp minor and its parallel minor is E minor. E major is hard for wind instruments to play. A violin is fit for playing in E major, because two of the open strings are A and E, the tonic and subdominant notes of this scale. Other orchestral string instruments can play well in E major, as can a guitar. When writing in E major, clarinets in A are easier to play than clarinets in B-flat. This is because clarinets are transposing instruments. Symphonies in E major are quite rare, but the key is often used for concertos. One of them is Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto. thumb|400px| Ascending and descending E-major scale.
