 "text": "Dune is a fictional story set in a space empire far in the future. It is written by Frank Herbert. The book focuses on how politics, religion, technology and many other things interact. In the world of the Dune series, computers are banned (they are not allowed anywhere). Some humans are taught how to think as fast as computers; they are known as 'Mentats'. The ruler of a planet is controlled by a House. The Houses must obey House Corrino, because the leader of House Corrino is also the Emperor. Dune focuses on Paul Atreides, the 15-year-old heir to House Atreides. His family is forced by the Emperor who rules the Known Universe to leave the planet Caladan and to take control of the planet Arrakis. Arrakis is currently controlled by House Harkonnen, and is the only place that a spice called Melange is found. Melange is the most important thing in the universe. It lets you see the future and think much faster. If you take melange, you live much longer, sometimes even hundreds of years longer. It also lets you travel far distances at great speeds. Arrakis is a planet that is almost covered in desert. This large desert is very dangerous because it does not have potable (drinkable) water, but mainly because giant worms live in the sand. There are many groups of native humans living there - they are called the Fremen. The Fremen have many rituals that keep water safe. This is important, or they would all die of dehydration (too little water to stay alive). After his father is killed, Paul and his mother escape and take refuge with the Fremen. They use their abilities to achieve power over the Fremen and eventually use them to attack the Harkonnen armies, who have taken back control of the planet. In the books, there are the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, a religious group with only women as its members. This is because men do not have the right kind of mind to learn their ways correctly. They have much more control over their minds and bodies than normal people. Their goal is to protect the human race forever. They have a secret goal, which they want to achieve by their breeding program. It is to make a man that can be a Bene Gesserit. They call him the Kwisatz Haderach. They want to use the Kwisatz Haderach to control people more easily. Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, is a member of the sisterhood and trains her son to use mental and physical powers. Multiple films and TV series have been based on the Dune series, such as the 1984 film version directed by David Lynch, and the 2021 film directed by Denis Villeneuve. ==Other websites== * Official website for Dune and its sequels * DuneAudio.com - The Official Dune Audiobook Site ~ news and contests for Dune audiobooks * Complete Book Summary of Dune .
