 "text": "Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner are fictional characters from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon series. In the cartoons, the Coyote repeatedly tries to catch the Road Runner. However, the Road Runner runs very fast. That means the Coyote never gets the Road Runner. Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses complex traps to get his prey. They don't work, and often hurt the Coyote instead. Many of these traps are mail-ordered from companies named Acme. The characters were made by writer Michael Maltese and animation director Chuck Jones in 1948. They were made for the Warner Bros. network. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons, like Tom and Jerry. It became popular in its own right. The Coyote and the Road Runner were in a number of video games on Atari, the Nintendo Entertainment System and the PlayStation. ==References== Category:Animated characters Category:Anthromophic characters Category:Fictional mammals Category:Fictional birds Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1949 Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:Space Jam characters",
