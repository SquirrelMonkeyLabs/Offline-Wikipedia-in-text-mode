 "text": "The Baroque (, ; ) is a style of architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, and other arts that flourished in Europe from the early 17th century until the 1750s There are regional differences in Baroque style, the biggest of these is that the \"northern style\" is different from the \"southern style\". Baroque followed Renaissance art and Mannerism. It came before the Rococo (in the past often referred to as \"late Baroque\") and Neoclassical styles. It was encouraged by the Catholic Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant architecture, art, and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of Europe as well. == What it looks like == The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail, deep color, grandeur, and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to the rest of Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Poland. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called rocaille or Rococo, which appeared in France and Central Europe until the mid to late 18th century. In the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires including the Iberian Peninsula it continued, together with new styles, until the first decade of the 19th century. In the decorative arts, the style employs plentiful and intricate ornamentation. The departure from Renaissance classicism has its own ways in each country. But a general feature is that everywhere the starting point is the ornamental elements introduced by the Renaissance. The classical repertoire is crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in order to provoke shock effects. New motifs introduced by Baroque are: the cartouche, trophies and weapons, baskets of fruit or flowers, and others, made in marquetry, stucco, or carved. == Gallery == File:Bregenz 10.JPG|The chapel of Saint Johannes von Nepomuk, in the city of Bregenz in Austria File:Kathedrale Fulda-6385.jpg|The Cathedral of Fulda, in Germany File:Belvedere Vienna June 2006 005.jpg|The gate of Belvedere palace in Vienna File:Belvedere Wien5.jpg|What lies beyond the gate, Belvedere Palace, panoramic view File:Stift melk 001 2004.jpg|Melk Abbey / Stift Melk is one of the best-known monasteries in Austria File:Stift Melk 009.jpg|Part of the image on the ceiling in the library of Stift Melk File:WinterPalace.jpg|The Winter Palace in St. Petersburg File:Внутренний двор Зимнего дворца.jpg|Winter Palace, again, different view File:061117 karlskirche quer.jpg|The Karlskirche (St. Charles' Church) in Vienna among the most important Baroque churches north of the Alps File:Wien - Karlskirche, Chorraum und Oratorium.JPG|The altar and oratory insde the Karlskirche File:Intercession of Charles Borromeo supported by the Virgin Mary - Detail Rottmayr Fresco - Karlskirche - Vienna.JPG|Detail of a fresco inside the Karlskirche File:Baroque ceiling frescoes (Ljubljana Cathedral).jpg File:Saint Peters Basilica Interior21.jpg ==References== ==Related pages== *Baroque music *Rococo == Other websites == *The difference between Classicism and baroque in video.
