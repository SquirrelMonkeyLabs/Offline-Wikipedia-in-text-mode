It was held at the Soviet Union's embassy at Tehran in Iran. It was the first of the World War II conferences of the \"Big Three\" Allied leaders (the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom). The main result of the Tehran Conference was the Western Allies' commitment to open a second front against Nazi Germany. The conference also addressed the Big Three Allies' relations with Turkey and Iran, operations in Yugoslavia and against Japan. ==References== Category:World War II Category:1943 Category:Franklin D.
