 "text": "Angelo Soliman, born Mmadi Make, was an Austrian Freemason who lived from c. 1721â€“1796. He became popular in Viennese society and as a Freemason. == History == Soliman was most likely a member of the Kanuri ethnic group's Magumi subdivision. His given name was Mmadi Make, a name associated with a royal family in Borno State, modern Nigeria. He was taken away as a child and sent to Marseille as a slave. He was sold to a Messinan marchioness, who was in charge of his education. He chose the name 'Angelo' out of love for another servant in the household, Angelina. He chose September 11, his baptismal day, as his birthday. == Reference == Category:Austrian people Category:1790s births Category:1796 deaths Category:Freemasons",
