 "text": "Marmite (/ˈmɑːrmaɪt/ MAR-myte) is a British savoury food spread based on yeast extract, invented by the German scientist Justus von Liebig. It is made from by-products of beer brewing (lees). It is produced by the British company Unilever. Marmite is a vegan source of B vitamins, including supplemental vitamin B12. It is usually spread very thinly on buttered toast. Marmite is a sticky, dark brown paste with a distinctive, salty, powerful flavour and heady aroma. This distinctive taste is represented in the marketing slogan: \"Love it or hate it.\" In British popular culture Marmite is often used as a metaphor for something that is an acquired taste or polarises opinion. Marmite is commonly used as a flavouring, as it is particularly rich in umami due to its very high levels of glutamate (1960 mg/100 g). Marmite is also a French term for a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot, which is shown on the label. A different product of the same name is sold in New Zealand and Australia. ==References== Category:British food Category:Spreads",
