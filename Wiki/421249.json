 "text": "The Apprentice is an British business-themed reality television program. Each series, a group of young entrepreneurs compete to win a £250,000 investment in their business plans from billionaire businessman and member of the House of Lords, Alan Sugar. == Game == For twelve weeks, the contestants are split into two teams and must complete business-related tasks. At the end of each task, Sugar and his two assistants, Karren Brady and Claude Littner, \"fire\" a person from the losing team. Eventually, only one contestant remains and they win the investment. In the first few years of the show, the prize was a job at one of Sugar's companies. In season 7, they changed the prize to a business investment. == Overview == === Main series === Year Series Winner Contestants Tasks Episodes Host Advisors 2005 1 Tim Campbell 14 12 14 Alan Sugar Margaret Mountford Nick Hewer 2006 2 Michelle Dewberry 12 2007 3 Simon Ambrose 16 14 2008 4 Lee McQueen 16 2009 5 Yasmina Siadatan 15 14 2010 6 Stella English 16 Karren Brady 2011 7 Tom Pellereau 2012 8 Ricky Martin 2013 9 Leah Totton 2014 10 Mark Wright 20 2015 11 Joseph Valente 18 Claude Littner 2016 12 Alana Spencer 2017 13 James White Sarah Lynn 2018 14 Sian Gabbidon 16 2019 15 Carina Lepore 2022 16 Harpreet Kaur Tim Campbell 2023 17 Marnie Swindells 18 12 2024 18 Rachel Woolford 2025 19 Series ongoing === Spin-off series === ==== The Apprentice: You're Fired! ==== The Apprentice: You're Fired is a talk show which airs directly after each episode of the main show.
