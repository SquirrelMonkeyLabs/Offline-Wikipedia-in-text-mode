 "text": "Serbia and Montenegro (Serbian: Србија и Црна Гора, Srbija I Crna Gora, abbreviated as \"SCG\") was the name of the union of Serbia and Montenegro that was created after the collapse of Yugoslavia. The two nations were seperated in 2006 after a vote. It was on the west-central Balkan Peninsula. It had borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, to the west, Hungary to the north, Romania and Bulgaria to the east, North Macedonia to the south and Albania to the southwest, with just over 200 km of coast on the Adriatic. Serbia and Montenegro worked together in only some political areas. The states had separate economic policies and currencies (money). Although both the states now had more freedom to do as they are pleased than they did as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro were still a Sovereign State united under one government. The people of Montenegro wanted independence however, and on 21 May 2006 the government held a vote to ask the Montenegrins whether they still wanted to stay in the union. 55.5% of Montenegrins agreed to be independent. On 3 June 2006 Montenegro declared independence; followed by Serbia's declaration of independence two days later on 5 June 2006.
