 "text": "Rachel Frobel (née Collins, b. 1976) is an American professional wrestler who is better known by her ring name MsChif. She has been wrestling since 2001 and in that time has worked for several independent promotions across the United States, with guest matches in England and Japan. She is known for her banshee gimmick, howling at her opponents and referees who stand in her way, as well as her unusually flexible body that allows her to perform, and be subjected to, modified submission holds. For two years, between 2008 and 2010, she was a triple crown champion holding the NWA World Women's Championship for the second time, as well as the Shimmer Championship and the NWA Midwest Women's Championship. As well as being a two-time NWA World Champion, she is also a ChickFight tournament winner. ==Championships and awards== *ChickFight **ChickFight IV *Coastal Wrestling Association **CWA Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Cindy Rogers *Gateway Championship Wrestling **GCW Light Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA World Women's Championship (2 times) **NWA Midwest/IWA Mid-South Women's Championship (1 time) **NWA Midwest Women's Championship (2 times)1 *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Ranked No. 4 of the best 50 female singles wrestlers in the PWI Female 50 in 2009 *Shimmer Women Athletes **Shimmer Championship (1 time) *Zero1 Pro Wrestling USA **Zero1 Pro Wrestling USA Midwest Women's Championship (1 time) ==References== Category:1976 births Category:American professional wrestlers Category:Sportspeople from St. Louis, Missouri Category:Living people",
