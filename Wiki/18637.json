The Hohokam created about 135 miles (217 km) of irrigation canals. This let them grow things on the land. It is believed that between AD 1300 and AD 1450 drought and floods caused the Hohokam to no longer live in the area.\"Out of the Ashes, Early Life along the Salt River .\" City of Phoenix .

Spanish and Mexican explorers knew of the area but they did not go as far north as the Salt River Valley. === Early history === In 1867, Jack Swilling of Wickenburg, Arizona came to the area. He saw that the land was good for farming. The only problems he saw were a lack of rain and good irrigation. Swilling corrected the problem by having a series of canals built. A small community was created about four miles (6 km) east of the where the city is today. The farming community was named Swilling's Mill. The name was later changed to Helling Mill, Mill City, and East Phoenix. Swilling was a Confederate soldier during the Civil War. He wanted to name the city \"Stonewall,\" after Gen. Stonewall Jackson. Other people had other ideas for names. Finally, Lord Darrell Duppa suggested the name \"Phoenix\".

This allows the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. The Salt River runs westward through the city of Phoenix. The riverbed is often dry or just a trickle due to large irrigation usage. The river is full after infrequent rainstorms or when more water is released from upstream dams. The city of Tempe has built two inflatable dams in the Salt River bed to create a year-round recreational lake, called Tempe Town Lake. The dams are deflated to allow the river to flow unimpeded during releases. Lake Pleasant Regional Park is in Northwest Phoenix in the suburb of Peoria, Arizona. As with most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Gov. Jack Williams argued to Congress that energy use would increase in the evening. Refrigeration units were not used as often in the morning on standard time.
