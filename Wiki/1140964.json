 "text": "In mathematics, the octonion number system extends the complex numbers into eight dimensions. It is represented using the symbol \\mathbb O. The 16-dimensional sedenions come after the octonions. ==History== The octonions were first described by Irish mathematician John T. Graves in 1843, who originally called them \"octaves\". They were independently described by Arthur Cayley in 1845. ==Introduction== The octonions take on the following form, with 8 total elements. is a real number, and the others are imaginary units belonging to 7 different dimensions. : ==Multiplication== The Fano plane is a diagram that shows how another octonion element is obtained when two octonion elements are multiplied with each other. The two examples below illustrate how a positive product is obtained when moving along with directions of the arrows in the Fano plane. : : The two examples below illustrate how a negative product is obtained when moving against the directions of the arrows in the Fano plane. : : Both quaternions and octonions are non-commutative, but octonions are also non-associative. However, quaternions are associative. The example below shows how the results of multiplying , , change when they are grouped differently (in order words, when the order of operations differ). : : ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Algebra Category:Numbers",
