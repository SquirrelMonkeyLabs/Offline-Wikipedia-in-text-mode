 "text": "Staats Island is one of the Falkland Islands. It is located between San Rafael Island and San Jos√© Island, parallel to Tea Island and has an area of 5 square kilometers. It is known for its Patagonian foxes and guanacos, both introduced species. People brought guanacos to the island. These animals eat too much tussac grass, which stops the plants from growing back. Foxes were also brought in, and they hunt the local birds. There is no plan yet to remove the foxes from this island or the other islands in the San Rafael group. The empty island is also home to Magellanic penguins and many other seabirds. == References == Category:Falkland Islands",
