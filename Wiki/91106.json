It was first performed at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, on March 6, 1853. The title \"La traviata\" means literally The Woman Who Strayed, or perhaps more figuratively, The Fallen One. Although a failure at its premiere, the opera soon established itself and became one of the best- loved and most frequently performed, recorded and filmed of all operas.
