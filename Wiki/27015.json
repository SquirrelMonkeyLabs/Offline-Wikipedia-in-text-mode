 "text": "Viola sororia, also known as Viola papilionacea, blue violet, common violet, meadow violet or purple violet, is a species of violet. It is a perennial flowering plant that lives in most of eastern North America. The common blue violet is the state flower of the U.S. states of Rhode Island, Illinois, and New Jersey. In developed areas it is often said to be a weed because it grows well in lawns. ==References== *Viola sororia from the Connecticut Botanical Society *Viola sororia from the Virginia Tech Weed Identification Guide Category:Violets Category:Perennials",
