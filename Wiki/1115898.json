 "text": "The Darién Gap is a geographic region that connects the American continents. In Spanish, it is called Tampón de Darién , . It has a reputation as one of the most inhospitable regions in the world. The Darién Gap is in southern Panama's Darién Province and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department. The area is mostly rainforests and mountains. There also is a watershed. The area is very remote, terrain is difficult, and the environment is extreme. It is very difficult to travel through the Darién Gap. Nevertheless, as the only land bridge between North and South America, the Darién Gap has historically served as a major route for both humans and wildlife. == Geography == The geography of the Darién Gap is very varied. The Colombian side is dominated primarily by the river delta of the Atrato River. This creates a flat marshland at least wide. The name of the Tanela River, which flows toward Atrato, was Hispanicized to Darién by 16th-century European conquistadors. The Serranía del Baudó mountain range extends along Colombia's Pacific coast and into Panama. The Panamanian side is very different: It is a mountainous rainforest. Its terrain reaches from above sea level in the valley floors to at the tallest peak, Cerro Tacarcuna, in the Serranía del Darién. == People == Most people living in the Darién Gap are indigenous people. Two major tribes are the Embera-Wounaan and Guna. In 1995, a population of just 8.000 people was reported, distributed among five tribes. The only larger settlement in the region is La Palma, the capital of Darién Province. It has a population of about 4,200 residents. Other population centers include Yaviza and El Real, both on the Panamanian side. == Economy == Because the region is so isolated, and the geography is harsh, the Darién Gap is largely undeveloped. Economic activities are usually small-scale farming, raising cattle, and lumber. There is a lot of crime in the area, usually human trafficking or trafficking drugs. == Infrastructure == There is no road, not even a primitive one, across the Darién. In fact, Colombia and Panama are the only countries in the Americas that share a land border but lack even a basic road linking them. The \"Gap\" interrupts the Pan-American Highway, which breaks at Yaviza, Panama and resumes at Turbo, Colombia roughly away. Infrastructure development has been difficult because of logistical challenges, financial costs, and environmental concerns. Attempts failed in the 1970s and 1990s. As of 2024, there is no active plan to build a road through the Gap, although there is discussion of reestablishing a ferry service and building a rail link. == Travel == Because of the harsh conditions, traveling within the Darien Gap is usually done by boat. Boats are usually small, or they are traditional watercraft such as pirogues. The only other option is hiking. It is difficult and dangerous. Natural threats include deadly wildlife, tropical diseases, and frequent heavy rains and flash floods. There is no law enforcement, and violent crimes are common. There is no medical support, and even minor injuries may become fatal. === Major migration route === Even though traveling there is dangerous, the Darién Gap is one of the main migration routes across the Americas. Many migrants from Haiti or Venezuela use it to get to the Mexico–United States border. In 2022, there were 250,000 crossings, compared to only 24,000 in 2019. In 2023, the number of migrants who had passed through the Gap more than doubled to 520,000. == References == == Further reading (most recent first) == * * * Category:Geography of Panama Category:Geography of Colombia",
