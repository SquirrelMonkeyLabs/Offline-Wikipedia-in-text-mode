 "text": "sexual maturity is the capability and genetic function of all organisms to reproduce and grow to their full stages of sexual reproduction, to produce offspring and populate their respective species. it all starts when an organism gets older and more hormonal signals are charged thus causing a whole lot of change in the physiology of the organism size, age and reproductive organs. == Mammal sexual maturity description == sexual maturity in mammals is when an adult or fully grown up animal has reach the full growth of their sex organs and when they get older and their bodies to produce more hormones, it first start off when a juvenile reaches signs of puberty having pubic hair, deep voice and the capability to breastfeed offspring through sucking of a females breast or mammary gland and the capability for males to ejaculate and have sexual intercourse . this goes with all mammals. some mammals either have the capability to reproduce and be infertile, all the information about sexual maturity and fertilization all rely on DNA, genetics and mutation. == plant sexual maturity descriptions == plants sexual maturity is when the plant now sends hormonal signals to the shoot apex (a terminal bud that grows 0.1 to 1.0 mm that contains the apical meristem, which develops l leaves and the surrounding leaf primordial) which helps in stimulation the sexual reproduction and development. the factors that contribute to a plants sexual maturity is age, size, ecology, environment, exposure to the sun, their competition, their temperature and nutrients. they can also spread pollen filled with sperm cells that can be picked up by insects that ingest the nectar of the flower they are on like bees == Anatomy of sexual maturity == The anatomy of sexual maturity is categorized by the elongation of the penis on the male and the development of the mammary glands and the breasts on the female as well as the fact that now, fully grown adult males can now ejaculate and that fully grown adult females can now breastfeed offspring and give birth, females will also be on their periods (menstruation) which causes bleeding of the uterus. after sexual maturity, there will appear 1 out of roughly 300,000-400,000 fertilization egg only around 300-400 eggs are ovulated during sexual intercourse, the male will ejaculate thus sperm will enter the females vagina and then insert themselves in the fertilization egg thus turning into a fetus overtime and after 7-9months,the fetus then turns into a fully grown infant. == species that lay eggs == there are many Species that can develop and form Eggs that contain the placenta inside which then helps the offspring develop inside the egg 20 0r 21 eggs in bird species such as poultry or waterfowl. in other species like insects and marine life, the animal can produce a random amount of eggs oftentimes more than one. It is oftentimes that eggs of certain marine species have a slim chance of survival, probabilities being 1 in 500 that an egg hatches and grows into a fledged out adult specimen. == Sources == *http://www.actforlibraries.org/an-explanation- of-sexual-maturity/#:~:text=Sexual%20maturity%20in%20plants%20happens%20as *http://www.plant-biology.com/Shoot- Apex.php#:~:text=The%20Shoot%20apex%20is%20also%20known%20as%20the,is%20present%20i *https://www.cnyfertility.com/how-many-eggs-do-women- have/#:~:text=Because%20many%20eggs%20start%20to%20develop%20but%20d *https://www.fao.org/3/y5169e/y5169e06.htm#:~:text=The%20incubation%20period%20for%20chicken,and%20replaced%20with%20more%20chicks.
