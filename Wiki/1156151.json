 "text": "Den Harrow was an Italo disco project from the mid 1980s, with Stefano Zandri (born 4 June 1962) as the face of the artist (lip syncing) , and Tom Hooker doing most of the vocals. It was revealed many years later that Zandri did not sing on any of their hits and that most of the songs were performed and co- written by Hooker. Den Harrow was conceived by producers Roberto Turatti and Miki Chieregato, who based it on the Italian word denaro (money). Category:Italian musical groups",
