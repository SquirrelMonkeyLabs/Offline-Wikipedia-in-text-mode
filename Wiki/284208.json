 "text": "Fiji Hindi is an Indo-Aryan language which is the mother tongue of 313,000 people of Indian and Pakistani origin in Fiji. This language's relationship with Modern Standard Hindi is similar to those between Dutch and Afrikaans. The language is composed of the Eastern Hindi dialects (Bhojpuri and Awadhi) with numerous English and Fijian words. It is spoken with a Pacific twang. In recent times, due to the political upheaval in Fiji, large numbers of Fiji Indians have migrated to Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada, taking the Fiji Hindi language with them. ==References== ==Other websites== * Ethnologue - Fiji Hindi Category:Hindi Category:Urdu dialects Category:Urdu language Category:Languages of Fiji",
