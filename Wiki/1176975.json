It was not only a fashion statement but also a symbol of his groundbreaking contributions to music and dance. The \"Thriller\" music video, released in 1983, is considered a landmark moment in music history, and the jacket has since become synonymous with Jackson's legacy. The \"Thriller\" jacket continues to inspire fashion and pop culture, and replicas of the jacket are popular among fans and collectors. Its impact on music videos and the integration of fashion with performance art remains significant to this day.",
