He was a great scorer and known for his strong headers. Daei was the world's top international goal-scorer for a long time until Cristiano Ronaldo scored more goals. After he stopped playing, Daei worked for FIFA and was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. == Early life == === Relationships === Iranian journalist Camelia Entekhabifard mentioned in her memoir that she married Ali Daei in 1997, but the couple later separated. === Business Ventures and Philanthropy === Ali Daei owns a sportswear company called Daei Sport's Wears & Equipments, which produces jerseys for Iranian sports clubs and teams worldwide, including the Iranian national team.
