 "text": "Basil, called the Great or the Archimandrite (in Greek: Μέγας Βασίλειος) was bishop of Caesarea and one of the most relevant theologians of the 4th century. == Life == Aristocratic by culture and sense of responsibility as well as by the immense landed properties in Pontus and Armenia, Basil, born around 330, completed brilliant studies of rhetoric (including philology, philosophy and administration) in Caesarea, Constantinople and Athens, where he formed a close friendship with Gregory of Nazianzus. Since childhood he had received a solid Christian education, especially from his grandmother, Macrina senior. After the death of his father, in 358, he renounced his career, sold his goods, asked for baptism and retired to Annesi, in a family property on the Iris, with his mother and sister Macrina junior; he had been preceded by his elder brother Naucratius and to some extent had shared this way of life, until his marriage, also his younger brother Gregory of Nyssa. == References == Category:Bishops Category:Christian theologians Category:Christian saints Category:4th-century people",
