Core i5 also has support for dual-channel DDR SDRAM memory and have Hyper- threading disabled. A new feature called Turbo Boost Technology was introduced which maximizes speed for demanding computer programs. This increases performance to match the amount of work the computer must do.

Arrandale processors have integrated graphics capability but only two processor cores.
