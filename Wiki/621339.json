 "text": "Mentorship is when a person who is more experienced in a subject tutors another person to help them learn more about the subject. It is the process of guiding and influencing a personal and professional growth in an organization. Mentorship requires the mentor to have more experience in the subject they're tutoring in than the person teaching, also called a mentee. Mentorship is complete when the mentee has the same level of knowledge about the subject as the mentor. ==References== Category:Management Category:Learning Category:Training",
