 "text": "Pope Boniface V (??? â€“ 25 October 625) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 23 December 619 until 25 October 625 when he died. He played a significant role in the Christianization of England. He enacted a decree that designated churches as places of refuge for criminals. After over a year of vacancy, he replaced Pope Adeodatus I. He was described by Liber Pontificalis as \"the mildest of men\", whose chief distinction was his great love for the clergy. He died on 25 October 625 and was buried in St. Peter's Basilica. He was succeeded by Pope Sisinnius. ==References== Category:600s deaths Boniface V Category:Religious leaders from Naples Category:Year of birth unknown",
