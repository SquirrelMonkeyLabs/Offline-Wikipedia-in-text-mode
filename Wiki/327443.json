Hammond's Mandingo slave Ganymede, or Mede is trained to fight other slaves. Hammond neglects his wife Blanche whom he rejects on their wedding night after discovering she was not a virgin. Hammond instead rapes his slave Ellen while Blanche forces Mede to lay with her. These various, conflicting infidelities all eventually come together causing the movie to end tragically with the deaths of most of the main characters. ==Response== Upon its release in 1975, critical response was mixed although box office was strong. Roger Ebert despised the film and gave it a \"zero star\" rating. Richard Schickel of TIME found the film boring and cliché-ridden.Schickel, Richard.\"Cinema: Cold, Cold Ground\" , TIME, May 12, 1975. Movie critic Robin Wood was enthusiastic about the movie, calling it “the greatest film about race ever made in Hollywood”. In Leonard Maltin's annual publication Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide the movie is ranked as a \"BOMB\" and dismissed with the word \"Stinko!\" Some prominent critics hail the film, including the New York Times columnist Dave Kehr, who called it \"a thinly veiled Holocaust film that spares none of its protagonists,\" further describing it as \"Fleischer’s last great crime film, in which the role of the faceless killer is played by an entire social system.\" Director Quentin Tarantino has cited Mandingo as one of only two instances \"in the last twenty years [that] a major studio made a full-on, gigantic, big-budget exploitation movie\", comparing it to Showgirls. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Trailer at Trailers From Hell Category:American drama movies Category:1975 drama movies Category:1970s historical movies Category:English-language movies Category:Movies about slavery Category:Movies about racism Category:Movies based on books Category:Movies based on plays Category:Exploitation movies Category:Movies set in the 1840s Category:Movies set in New Orleans Category:Paramount Pictures movies Category:Movies directed by Richard Fleischer Category:Movies composed by Maurice Jarre",
