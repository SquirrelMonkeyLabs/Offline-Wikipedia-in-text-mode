 "text": "Avet Terterian (1929 - 1994) was a leading Armenian composer, awarded by Konrad Adenauer prize. He composed eight (completed) symphonies, an opera and several chamber works. Several of his symphonies are recorded (the date 1973 in the Musicweb review of the Melodiya recording of symphony 3 is probably a typographical error, since the publisher's listing also gives 1975 for the first performance of that work). Yekaterinburg's annual music festival is named after him. ==Other websites== *Avet Terterian (from the Soviet Composers Web page) *Description of Symphonies 3 and 6, Review of Melodiya CD Category:1929 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Armenian composers Category:20th-century composers Category:Armenian diaspora",
