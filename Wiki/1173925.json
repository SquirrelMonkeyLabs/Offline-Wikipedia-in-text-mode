 "text": "Manuel Araullo High School, commonly known as Araullo High School, situated in Ermita, Manila, Philippines, is one of the oldest public high schools in the city. ==Timeline== * Before acquiring its name, the school originated as Manila High School — an institute already existing since 1906. In 1921, the Manila city government mandated secondary schools in each of its four districts: Manila North High School, Manila East High School, and Manila West High School. — and Manila High School was designated as Manila South High School.Manila Ordinance 1603, dated June 8, 1930 * In June 1930, yet again, the schools in each Manila quadrant were renamed after jurists; Cayetano Arellano (North), Victorino Mapa (East), Florentino Torres (West) — and Manila South High School became Manuel Araullo High School to honor the departed third Chief Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court. * The school was completely destroyed during the bombings of World War II. However, starting 1949, annexes of a renewed Manuel Araullo High School were deployed in different locations of Manila; until 1962 when its present-day campus in Ermita, Manila was decided. Currently, the school has around 6,000 students enrolled. ==External websites== * Araullo High Scool * Araullo High School Information System ==References== Category:High schools in the Philippines Category:Education in the Philippines",
