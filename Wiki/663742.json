 "text": "The Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (MAP) is an ongoing research action. Its purpose is to discover, document and deal with archaeological remains found in the Black Sea. The project is run by the University of Southampton and funded by the Expedition and Education Foundation. In addition to studying shipwrecks, the project's international team is investigating changes in water level and how those changes affected people around the sea. In 2018, MAP announced the discovery of the oldest relatively intact ship in the world. It was at the bottom of the sea, about two kilometers below the surface. The ship has been radiocarbon-dated to around 400 B.C. It was a trading ship. It looks like ships shown on Greek pottery from the same era. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Europe Category:Archaeological sites in Asia",
