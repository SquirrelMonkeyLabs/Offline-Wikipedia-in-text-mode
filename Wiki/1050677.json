 "text": "The Copa América Femenina (also known as Copa América Feminina in Portuguese) is the main competition for women's national football teams in South America. It's like the women's version of the Copa América. They started it in 1991. At first, only the winning team got to go to the FIFA Women's World Cup. But in the third edition, the winners went automatically, and the second-place team had to play against a team from North and Central America (CONCACAF) to try and get into the World Cup. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions, the top two teams got direct spots in the 2003, 2007, and 2011 World Cups. In December 2020, CONMEBOL said they would have this tournament every two years instead of every four, starting in 2022. They also have versions of this tournament for Under-20 and Under-17 teams. == Results == Year Host First place game Third place game Champion Score / Venue Runner-up Third Score / Venue Fourth 1 1991 Brazil – – – 3 2 1995 Brazil 2–0 – 5 3 1998 Argentina 7–1 3–3 10 4 2003 PeruArgentinaEcuador – – 10 5 2006 Argentina – – 10 6 2010 Ecuador – – 10 7 2014 Ecuador – – 10 8 2018 Chile – – 10 9 2022 Colombia 1–0 3–1 10 ; Notes == Top Four classifications == So far, only Bolivia has not yet reached a top four position in the tournament.
