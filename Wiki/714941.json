 "text": "AGCO Corporation is an American agricultural equipment manufacturer. Their headquarters are in Duluth, Georgia, United States. ==History== AGCO was created in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz). KHD was a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had bought parts of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier. In March 1991, AGCO bought the Hesston Corporation. Because of this, they gained hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost. Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO bought the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company. In 1993, AGCO bought the rest of White-New Idea, gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a big manufacturing plant in Coldwater, Ohio, USA. In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers.GSI aims to be ‘local’ supplier across the globe, World-Grain; https://www.world- grain.com/articles/5267-gsi-aims-to-be-local-supplier-across-the-globe In 2017, AGCO acquired Precision Planting, LLC, a planting equipment and technology business. ==References== ==Other websites== * AGCO (official website) * AGCO SEC Filings Category:Companies based in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1990 establishments in the United States Category:Manufacturing companies of the United States",
