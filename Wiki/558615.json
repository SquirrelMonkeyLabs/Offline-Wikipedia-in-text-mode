He was the Vice President of Ecuador from 2007 to 2013, serving under President Rafael Correa. His election as Vice President was well known because as a paraplegic, Moreno was one of the world’s few disabled national leaders. On 2 April 2017, Moreno was elected President of Ecuador defeating banker Guillermo Lasso in the 2017 Ecuadorian presidential round-off with 51% of the vote to Lasso's 49%.http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/latest-ecuadoreans-choosing- president-close-race-46528194 On 24 May 2017, Moreno became the world’s only current head of state in a wheelchair. ==Early life== Moreno was born in Nuevo Rocafuerte, Orellana Province. He studied at Central University of Ecuador. He married Rocio Gonzalez and together they have three children. ==Shooting== On January 3, 1998, two young men approached Moreno in a grocery store parking lot in Quito and told him they wanted his car and his money. He freely gave them his wallet and keys, but one of the men shot him in the back anyway. This incident left Moreno paralyzed. ==Vice presidency (2007–2013)== During his first year in the office of Vice President of Ecuador, Moreno investigated the state of disabled people in Ecuador. He also founded the Manuela Espejo Solidarity Mission for the Disabled, which offers rehab, technical help, and psychological support to thousands of disabled Ecuadorians. Moreno left the Vice Presidency on May 24, 2013 and was succeeded by Jorge Glas. He is the first Ecuadorian vice president to complete his term since 1992. ==Honors== For his work providing respect and dignity to handicapped people, he was nominated for the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize. Moreno was appointed as Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in December 2013. ==President of Ecuador== ===2017 Presidential campaign=== In October 1st, 2016, he was nominated to the elections to the Ecuadorian presidency by his party, Alianza País. In February 2017, Moreno and Guillermo Lasso made it to the run-off election which was held on April 2, 2017. Moreno won the election with 51% of the vote to Lasso's 49%. Moreno was then sworn-in as President of Ecuador on 24 May 2017 in Quito. === Presidency === Though Moreno is a member of the PAIS Alliance, the same party as Rafael Correa, Moreno has taken Ecuador in a different direction than Correa did. Moreno is a more moderate, centrist figure and has restored presidential term limits, improved Ecuador's ties with the United States, and he has distanced himself from Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela. He did not run for re- election in the 2021 election and was replaced by conservative banker Guillermo Lasso who won the election. ==References== ==Other websites== * VicePresidencia del Ecuador * Lenin Moreno NO gana el Premio Nobel a la Paz y tiene 98% de aprovación Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Ecuadorian activists Category:Assassination survivors Category:People with disabilities Category:Presidents of Ecuador Category:Vice presidents of Ecuador Category:Disability activists Category:Orellana Province",
