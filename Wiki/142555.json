 "text": "The electrical telegraph is a telegraph that uses electric signals. This is a signalling system where an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key which results in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by a human operator. ==Types of electrical telegraphs== ===Gauss-Weber telegraph and Carl Steinheil=== Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber installed a 1,200m long wire above the town of Göttingen's roofs. They were allowed to do this on 6 May 1833. Carl August Steinheil was able to build a telegraph network in 1835–1836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835. ===Schilling telegraph=== The telegraph had a transmitting device which had a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current. ===Alter and the Elderton Telegraph=== Dr. David Alter created it one year before the much more popular Morse telegraph was invented. Alter demonstrated it publicly. ===Morse telegraphs=== In the United States, the telegraph was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. Morse created an electrical telegraph in 1837. His version was a design that could transmit over long distances using poor quality wire. Vail, his assistant, developed the Morse code signalling alphabet with Morse. == Related pages == * Telegraph == Other websites == *1837 AD Samuel Morse Invents the Electric Telegraph *The Electric Telegraph (1838–1914) *Electrical telegraph Category:Telegraphy",
