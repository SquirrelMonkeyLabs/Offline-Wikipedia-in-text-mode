 "text": "Wild rice (also called Canada rice, Indian rice, and water oats) is four species of grasses forming the genus Zizania, and the grain which can be harvested from them. The grain was historically gathered and eaten in both North America and China. While it is now something of a delicacy in North America, the grain is no longer eaten in China, where the plant's stem is used as a vegetable. == Other websites == * Australian wild rice; information about cultivated wild rice in Australia * Zizania in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System * Save Our Rice Alliance; information on wild rice harvest, management and distribution across the Upper Great Lakes Region * Multilingual taxonomic information from the University of Melbourne * Asian Vegetables * Zizania aquatica * Jenks, Albert Ernest (1901).
