The mosque was renovated on April 2010 with help from the Indonesian Economic and Trade Office to Taipei. ==Architecture== The mosque is a building with five floors. It has Islamic traditional culture and modern architecture. ==Activities== The mosque serves as the headquarters of the Chinese Muslim Youth League. It also houses the office of the Taiwan Halal Integrity Development Association, a group that issues Halal certification to food products produced in Taiwan for Muslims to eat. The mosque also has dormitories for Muslim travelers and foreign missionaries to stay. ==Funding== It is not like Taipei Grand Mosque, which is heavily supported by the ROC government and Kuomintang. Taipei Cultural Mosque depends heavily on private donations. This makes it a purely civilian mosque concentrating on religious affairs. ==References== Category:Mosques in Taiwan Category:Taipei Category:1950 establishments in Asia Category:20th-century establishments in Taiwan",
