 "text": "\"Moonlight\" is the third single off of American rapper XXXTentacion's second studio album ?. The song was released on March 16, 2018 and as a single on August 14, 2018. The song was able to make it to #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was tied with \"Falling Down\" (with Lil Peep) as the third-highest-charting song in the United States. On October 1, 2018, a music video for the song was released. The music video was directed by JMP. In the video, Onfroy is seen at a party in the darkly lit woods. He wears headphones and walks around the party smiling with people. He is also seen off to the side by himself while watching partygoers. The text at the end of the video reads \"ENERGY NEVER DIES. HE IS AMONGST US. LONG LIVE JAH.\" which is a tribute to Onfroy who died before the video was released. The music video has more than 1 billion views on YouTube. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2018 songs Category:XXXTentacion songs Category:Hip hop songs",
