 "text": "Carlo Acutis (3 May 1991 – 12 October 2006) was an English-born Italian Catholic website designer. He helped document Eucharistic miracles and approved Marian apparitions. Acutis would record them on a website he created before his death. He was known for his computer skills, and dedication to the Eucharist. He was nicknamed \"God's Influencer\". In May 2024, Pope Francis cleared the way for Acutis to become the first canonized millennial in the Catholic Church. He was previously beatified by Pope Francis in October 2020. ==Life== Acutis was born in London, England. His family moved to Milan, Italy not long after his birth. Neither of his parents were religious, and they had worked in London and Germany before Acutis was born. Acutis also struggled with his weight when he was younger. As a sacrifice, he would give up sweets or his favourite movies. He was inspired by the poverty the Franciscan order and wanted to do the same. Having a passion of computers and web design, Acutis began creating a website dedicated to recording each reported Eucharistic miracle in the world and keeping a list of the approved Marian apparitions of the Catholic Church. Acutis launched the website in 2004 and worked on it for two and a half years. Acutis died on 12 October 2006 in Monza, Italy from a cerebral hemorrhage caused by cancer-related treatments at the age of 15. He was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia a week before his death. It was Acutis' final wish to be buried in Assisi after his death. In April 2018, his body, which did not decompose was brought to the Sanctuary of the Spoliation so that people could visit and pray at his tomb and body. ==Legacy== Acutis was beatified by Pope Francis on 10 October 2020, two days before the 14th anniversary of his death. In April 2022, the first life-sized statue of Acutis in the United Kingdom was honored at Carfin Grotto, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. Pope Francis has also spoken about Acutis as a model for people who live normal lives to \"grow in holiness\". On 23 May 2024, Pope Francis recognized a miracle done by Acutis, making it possible for him to become the first canonized millennial in the Catholic Church. ==More readings== * ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website * The apparitions of Our Lady – List of Marian apparitions catalogued by Acutis * Eucharistic Miracles – List of Eucharistic miracles catalogued by Acutis * 2006 Hagiography Circle * Wolverhampton Parish of Blessed Carlo Acutis – Incorporating the churches of St Peter & Paul, St Michael and St Bernadette. * \"My Son Carlo\" – biography of Carlo Acutis by his mother, Antonia Salzano Acutis Category:1991 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Deaths from cerebral hemorrhage Category:Deaths from acute myeloid leukemia Category:People from Milan Category:People from London Category:Christian saints",
