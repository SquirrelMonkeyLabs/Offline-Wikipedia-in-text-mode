 "text": "Admiralty MRT station (NS10) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the North South Line in Woodlands, Singapore. The name of this station came from a former British naval base located on the northern coast of Singapore. ==History== In 1990, the government proposed to build the North South Line Woodlands Extension to extend the existing North-South and East- West lines. The extension connects Choa Chu Kang with Yishun. Construction started in 1991 and the station was opened on 10 February 1996 along with the other five stations on the Woodlands Extension. Television screens were installed at Admiralty station, along with Woodlands, Marsiling and Yew Tee stations. On 2 March 2007, 2,900 commuters were stranded as train services between the Admiralty and Kranji MRT stations were disrupted for about 45 minutes. Bridging bus services were deployed to ferry the passengers to Kranji. ===Incident=== On 7 June 2017, a 34 year-old man was arrested for leaving a luggage bag unattended at the bicycle bay of the station. ==Related pages== *Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:Woodlands, Singapore",
