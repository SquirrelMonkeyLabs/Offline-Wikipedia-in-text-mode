 "text": "In Christian theology, Jewish deicide is the theological view that the Jews as a people are responsible for the Crucifixion of Jesus. * * * ==Overview== The view is said to have spread in the early days of Christianity when early Christian theologians (Church Fathers) wrote about it. Since the end of the Holocaust, * * * * * * * * * * * during which at least 6,000,000 Jews were killed, this matter has been discussed by modern historians from different disciplines. * James Parkes, Prelude to Dialogue (London: 1969) p. 153; cited in Wilken, p. xv. * * * * * * Now, Jewish deicide is considered an antisemitic trope and no longer agreed by mainstream churches. ==New Testament== ===Gospel of Matthew=== The view is said to have been based on Matthew 27:24–25: ===Gospel of John=== The view is also said to have been based on John 5:16–18, where John referred to the Jews directly: In the Greek Bible (The New Testament's original Greek text), Ἰουδαῖοι (Ioudaios) was used, meaning \"the Jews\" or \"the Judeans\", though some scholars claimed that the passage should be analyzed in the context of how later Christians interpreted it. ===First Epistle to the Thessalonians=== In the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul wrote,Jeremy Cohen, Christ Killers: The Jews and the Passion from the Bible to the Big Screen, Oxford University Press 2007. p. 55. ==Church Fathers' views== ===Ignatius of Antioch=== In the early decades of Christianity, Ignatius of Antioch (c. 50–117) claimed that those who followed Jewish custom were \"partakers with those who killed Jesus\". ===Justin Martyr=== Justin Martyr (100–165) claimed that God's covenant (also known as the Old Covenant or Mosaic Covenant) with the Jews was no longer valid and that Christians had replaced them because the Jews \"[had] slain the Just One [Jesus]\", who would deserve exile and persecution in the centuries to come. ===Irenaeus=== Irenaeus (130–202) claimed that the Jews had been \"disinherited from the grace of God\" as they had \"rejected the Son of God and slew Him\". ===Tertullian of Carthage=== Tertullian of Carthage (155–230) blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus. ===Origen of Alexandria=== Origen of Alexandria (185–254), along with John Chrysostom (c. 347 – 407), is said to have been responsible for much of Christian antisemitism. He held the Jews responsible for the killing of Jesus. He believed that Jerusalem deserved to perish and the Jewish nation to be overthrown in order for God's grace to be passed on to Christians. ===John Chrysostom=== John Chrysostom (c. 347–407), an important early Church Father who served as the archbishop of Constantinople, wrote in his homily series Adversus Judaeos (Ancient Greek: Κατὰ Ἰουδαίων Kata Ioudaiōn, \"against the Jews\"): As there were only two other ordained individuals in Antioch legally recognized as Christian preachers, Chrysostom managed to promote his ideas to most local Christians.Christine C. Shepardson, Controlling Contested Places: Late Antique Antioch and the Spatial Politics of Religious Controversy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014), 93) ==Academic views== Notably, John Chrysostom's Adversus Judaeos * * * is seen by many historians as having inspired antisemites in the following 1,600 years to justify pogroms, expulsions and discriminatory policies against Jews.Walter Laqueur, The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day (Oxford University Press: 2006) , pp. 47–48 Such antisemites include Nazi Germany's ruler Adolf Hitler, who reprinted and circulated Chrysostom's text among Germans within Nazi territories to justify the Holocaust. ===Amy-Jill Levine=== Regarding the Gospel of Matthew, Biblical scholar Amy-Jill Levine said that Matthew 27:24–25 had caused more suffering throughout Jewish history than any other passage in the New Testament. ===James Parkes=== Anglican priest James Parkes called Chrysostom's antisemitic homilies ===Jules Isaac=== French historian Jules Isaac (1877–1963), the author of the 1948 book Jésus et Israël, * 2002 Consultation of the National Council of Synagogues and the Bishops Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs. Retrieved August 22, 2016. * “A short introduction to Jules Isaac” * Carolyn Wesnousky, \"Under the Very Windows of the Pope”: Confronting Anti-Semitism in Catholic Theology after the Holocaust\" (2012), 59-60. further mentioned the issue in his 1956 book Génése de l’Anti-Sémitisme (\"Has Anti-Semitism Roots in Christianity?\"):Review of Jesus and Israel. Retrieved August 29, 2016. ===Steven Katz=== American philosopher Steven Katz (1944 – ), the founding director of the Elie Wiesel Center for Judaic Studies at Boston University in Massachusetts, wrote: ===Walter Laqueur=== Walter Laqueur (1921 – 2018), a German-American Jewish historian, said that the conditions for the 4th-century Christian church were \"brutal and aggressive\" as it was \"fighting for survival and recognition\", leading to the lack of demand for mercy and forgiveness, particularly due to the anti-Christian Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate (reigned 361 – 363). The three centuries of persecution of Christians did not end until the late 4th century, when the Christian church became the state religion of the Roman Empire under Theodosius I (reigned 379 – 395), who closed pagan temples in the process. ==Modern Christian views== ===Protestant churches=== It is said that most Protestant churches have never given a binding position on this theological view. Some, especially the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), have made official declarations against it. * Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (November 16, 1998). * \"Guidelines for Lutheran–Jewish Relations\". * World Council of Churches (July 1999). \"Guidelines for Lutheran–Jewish Relations\". In Current Dialogue, Issue 33. ===Roman Catholic Church=== The Roman Catholic Church (RCC) held the view until 1965, when the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II) passed the Nostra aetate, which includes the declaration that Since then, the Catholic Church has become divided, ensued by the rise of the radical traditionalist Catholics, * * * * * * * * * * who are active in current American politics. * * * * * * * * The Vatican II's position was supported by Pope John Paul II, when he led the Catholic Church between 1978 and 2005. * * * ==Related pages== * Jésus et Israël * Antisemitic stereotypes * Dual-covenant theology * Secondary antisemitism * Holocaust uniqueness debate ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Christianity Category:Catholicism Category:Antisemitism",
