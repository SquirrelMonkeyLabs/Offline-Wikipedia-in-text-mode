 "text": "The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (informally known as The Bosstones) are an American ska punk band from Boston, Massachusetts which formed in 1983. The Bosstones are widely credited as one of the originators of the genre of ska punk, a style which mixes the rhythms of ska music with the fast tempo and distortion of punk rock and hardcore punk. Their music is recognized for its prominent use of brass instruments as well as the deep, raspy voice of their lead singer Dicky Barrett. Their concerts are also notable for the presence of Ben Carr, a non-musician member of the Bosstones who dances onstage during the band's performances. First becoming notable in the underground music scene, the Bosstones steadily grew in popularity throughout the mid-1990s. Their fourth album, 1994's Question the Answers, sold over 500,000 copies and became a gold record. In 1995, they appeared in the hit movie Clueless and in 1997, the band released their most successful album, Let's Face It, which sold over one million copies and spawned the hit single \"The Impression That I Get\", which charted at #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Songs and entered the top 20 in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Although none of the Bosstones' future albums or singles were able to meet with the same kind of success, the band has kept a loyal following and continue to tour and record. The Bosstones briefly disbanded in 2003, though reunited in 2007 to continue touring and recording. The band has released nine studio albums, three EPs and a live album. ==Band members== ;Current members *Dicky Barrett - vocals (1983-present) *Joe Gittleman - bass guitar (1983-present) *Tim \"Johnny Vegas\" Burton - tenor saxophone (1983-present) *Ben Carr - dancer (1983-present) *Joe Sirois - drums (1991-present) *Kevin Lenear - alto and baritone saxophones (1991-1998, 2008-present) *Lawrence Katz - guitar (2000-present) *Chris Rhodes - trombone (2000-present) *John Goetchius - keyboards (2008-present) ;Former members *Nate Albert - guitar (1983-2000) *Tim Bridewell - trombone (1983-1991) *Josh Dalsimer - drums (1983-1991) *Roman Fleysher - saxophone (1998-2008) *Dennis Brockenborough - trombone (1991-2000) ==Discography== *Devil's Night Out (1989) *More Noise and Other Disturbances (1992) *Don't Know How to Party (1993) *Question the Answers (1994) *Let's Face It (1997) *Pay Attention (2000) *A Jackknife to a Swan (2002) *Pin Points and Gin Joints (2009) *The Magic of Youth (2011) ==References== Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American punk bands Category:American rock bands Category:Musical groups established in 1983 Category:Musical groups from Boston Category:1983 establishments in the United States Category:1980s establishments in Massachusetts Category:2003 disestablishments in the United States Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2003 Category:2007 establishments in the United States Category:2000s establishments in Massachusetts Category:2000s disestablishments in Massachusetts",
