 "text": "The Force 136 was a Far East branch of the British World War II intelligence organisation, the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Originally set up in 1941 as the India Mission with the cover name of GSI(k), it absorbed what was left of SOE's Oriental Mission in April 1942. The man in overall charge for the duration of the war was Colin Mackenzie. The organisation was established to encourage and supply resistance movements in enemy-occupied territory, and sometimes try sabotage operations. Force 136 operated in the regions of the South-East Asian Theatre of World War II which were taken over by Japan from 1941 to 1945: Burma, Malaya, China (Hong Kong), Sumatra, Siam, Indochina and Singapore. ==References== Category:Organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:World War II",
