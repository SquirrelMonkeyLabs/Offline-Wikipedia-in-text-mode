 "text": "News Corporation stylized as News Corp, is a mass media and publishing company headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was formed on June 28, 2013, following a spin-off of the media outlets of the original News Corporation as 21st Century Fox (21CF). Operating across digital real estate information, news media, book publishing, and cable television, News Corp's notable assets include Dow Jones & Company (publisher of The Wall Street Journal), News UK (publisher of The Sun and The Times), News Corp Australia, REA Group (operator of realestate.com.au), Realtor.com, and book publisher HarperCollins. It is one of two companies that succeeded the original News Corp., alongside 21st Century Fox, which consisted of broadcasting and media properties such as Fox Entertainment Group. The spin-out was structured so that 21CF was the legal continuation of the original News Corp., with the new News Corp being a new company formed by a stock split. Since March 19, 2019, Fox Corporation (which holds 21CF's national broadcasting, news and sports assets due to 21CF's sale to Disney the next day) is the sister company of News Corp under the Murdoch family's control. In September 2023, Rupert Murdoch announced he would step down as News Corp's chairman by November. == References == == Other websites == * Category:News Corporation Category:2013 establishments in New York (state) Category:Companies based in New York City",
