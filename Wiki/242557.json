 "text": "The NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition, at first called the National Hockey League All-Star Skills Competition, is an event on the night before the NHL All-Star Game. First held at the 41st National Hockey League All-Star Game in Pittsburgh in 1990, the NHL hosts the competition to show off the skills of the all-star players. Events include shot accuracy, fastest skater, puck control relay, hardest shot, breakaway challenge, and an elimination shootout. Players are put into teams in the same way the All-Star Game is done, which is by conferences. After each event, the winning conference is given points. ==Puck Control Relay== This event is to show who is the fastest skater while also moving the puck through pylons. Two races happen; the first one has three skaters on each team race against each other, and the second has the best single racers from each team. One point is given out to the winner of each of these two events. ===Winners=== Season Team Player 1990 Campbell Conference none 1991 Campbell Conference none 1992 Campbell Conference none 1993 Wales Conference none 1994 Western Conference Russ Courtnall 1996 Western Conference Pierre Turgeon 1997 Western Conference Geoff Sanderson 1998 World Teemu Selanne 1999 North America Paul Kariya 2000 World Paul Kariya 2001 North America Paul Kariya 2002 World none 2003 Eastern Conference Martin St. Louis 2004 Western Conference Rick Nash 2007 Western Conference Rick Nash 2008 Western Conference Shawn Horcoff ==Fastest skater== This event is to see who can skate the fastest around the rink once.
