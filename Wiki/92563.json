 "text": "Uckermark is a Kreis (district) in the northeastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district is the largest district in Germany. The current district Uckermark was made in 1993 by joining the old districts of Angermünde, Prenzlau and Templin and the city of Schwedt. == Coat of arms == The main feature of the coat of arms are the brick buildings of the district - the churches of Prenzlau and Angermünde. The city wall below remembers the many wars of medieval times. The two circular windows in the church tower symbolizes the division into two districts before the reform of 1817, the three gothic windows represent this division. On the city wall are two shields - one with the griffin of Pomerania, the other with the eagle of Brandenburg. The wavy lines in the upper part represent the main rivers in the district, Oder, Randow and Ucker. The yellow color of the background represents the agriculture of the district, as the Uckermark was the \"granary\" of Brandenburg. The coat of arms were created by Hans Benthin, and were officially granted on November 8, 1995. ==Towns and municipalities== Amt-free towns Ämter #Angermünde #Lychen #Prenzlau #Schwedt #Templin Amt-free municipalities #Boitzenburger Land #Nordwestuckermark #Uckerland 1\\.
