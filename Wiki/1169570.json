 "text": "Deurne is the second largest district of the municipality of Antwerp, Belgium. According to legend, the Irish missionary Fredigand was abbot of Kerkelodor Abbey in Deurne in the ninth century. The earliest concrete evidence of Deurne was not found until 1185, but there are hints that it existed in prehistoric and Roman periods. During the Ancien r√©gime, Deurne was merely a part of Antwerp's Eastern Hinterland. It was situated, like many other homes, at the intersection of a link route and a river (the Schijn).
