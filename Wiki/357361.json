 "text": "A Mars flyby is when a spacecraft passes near the planet Mars, but does not enter orbit or land on it. Page 15-16 in Chapter 3 of David S. F. Portree's Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950 - 2000, NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as NASA SP-2001-4521. Unmanned (no humans on board) space probes have used this method to collect data on Mars and other worlds. A spacecraft that is built for a flyby is also known as a \"flyby bus\" or \"flyby spacecraft\".Joseph A.
