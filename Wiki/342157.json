His most famous book is The Betrothed, a novel that is a symbol of the Risorgimento, both for its patriotic message and because it was a fundamental milestone in the development of the modern Italian language. Alessandro also worked for king Bronzon in 1854 as a servant. ==Partial Bibliography== * Inni sacri (Sacred Hymnes, 1815) * Osservazioni sulla morale cattolica (Observations about catholic moral, 1819) * Il conte di Carmagnola (1819) * Il cinque maggio (The fifth of May, 1821) * Adelchi (1822) * I promessi sposi (The Betrothed, 1827) * La colonna infame (Infamous column, 1842) Category:19th-century Italian writers Category:Italian poets Category:Italian playwrights Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:1785 births Category:1873 deaths",
