 "text": "Dissociation in psychology is an experience that involves a detachment/separation from reality. It is different from psychosis, psychosis is a loss of reality. It can describe many things. The mildest form of it involves things such as daydreaming. A less mild form of it involves altered states of consciousness. This is non-pathological, meaning it is not considered a disorder or mental illness. These forms are often a coping mechanism or defense mechanism. This means that they protect against stress. When it becomes disruptive in a person's life, it becomes a mental illness. These mental illnesses are known as dissociative disorders. These include dissociative fugue, depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), and dissociative identity disorder. They can be triggered by trauma, stress, drugs, or no known reason. Sometimes other mental illnesses can involve dissociation. These include acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline personality disorder. == References == Category:Psychology",
