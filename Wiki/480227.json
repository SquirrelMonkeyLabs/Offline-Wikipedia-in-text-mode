 "text": "David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is an American white supremacist, former grand wizard of the Klu Klux Klan, and neo-Nazi. He ran for President of the United States in 1988 and again in 1992. He was the subject of controversy because of his claim that Representative Scalise and other Republican leaders had links to him in the past. He was interviewed by Bill O'Reilly on the Fox News Channel and Michael Smerconish on the Cable News Network to discuss this. == References == ==Other websites== *Official website Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:1988 United States presidential candidates Category:1992 United States presidential candidates Category:American activists Category:Politicians from Louisiana Category:White supremacists",
