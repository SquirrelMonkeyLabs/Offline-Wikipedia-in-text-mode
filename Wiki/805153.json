 "text": "The 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak is a collection of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails stolen by one or more hackers working under the pseudonym \"Guccifer 2.0\" who are said to be Russian intelligence agency hackers, according to indictments carried out by the Mueller investigation. These emails were leaked by DCLeaks in June and July 2016 and by WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, just before the 2016 Democratic National Convention. This collection included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the DNC. The leak includes emails from seven key DNC staff members, and date from January 2015 to May 2016. The leaks also showed the DNC trying to sabotage and spread fake information to hurt then-2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign. On November 6, 2016, WikiLeaks released a second batch of DNC emails, adding 8,264 emails to its collection. ==References== Category:2016 in the United States Category:2016 United States presidential election Category:Bernie Sanders",
