 "text": "Ghil'ad Zuckermann (, ) is a linguist who examines the relationship between language and identity. He looks at different languages and finds out how one culture influences another culture. He analyses the role of language in politics and nationhood, and the dynamics between language, religion and society. He discovers the origins of words. He figures out how new words enter a language. He investigates words that come from several sources at the same time. He is \"a leading world expert in language revival\". He reclaims languages that are no longer spoken. He believes that reviving languages is good, beautiful and helpful. He suggests that we should compensate people whose mother tongue was \"killed\". He also believes that we should make indigenous tongues the official languages of their region, and that we should have official signs in several languages at the same time. He knows a lot about the revival of the Hebrew language. He was interviewed about it by Stephen Fry.Fry's Planet Word: Stephen Fry is asking Ghil'ad Zuckermann questions about the revival of the Hebrew language.
