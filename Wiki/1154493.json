 "text": "The Nagpur Faction and Scindia Faction of the Maratha Empire formed an alliance against Bhopal State in 1807 the Conflict lasted till 1816 with Bhopal state taken in British Protection. ==Background== During the Second Maratha War, the Nawab of Bhopal had a chance to take control of some land that belonged to Daulat Rao and the Raja of Berar, including the important area of Hoshangabad. Wazir Mohammad, the leader of Bhopal, formed an alliance with the Pindari leader Karim Khan after the war. To resolve issues in Bhopal, Daulat Rao cindia three battalions and some cavalry. He also laid siege to Rahat Garh and captured it in November 1807 after six months. After the death of Nawab Heyat Mohammad Khan, Daulat Rao planned to take control of Bhopal with help from the Raja of Nagpur. ==Conquest of Bhopal== ===Overview=== In December 1807, Sindhia persuaded Wazir Mohammad Khan to surrender the fort of Islam Nagar near Bhopal, hoping to subdue Bhopal with the help of the Raja of Berar. However, Wazir Mohammad Khan imprisoned Sindhia’s envoy, Kishanji Hoozooree. Scindia then sent Appa Cundra to punish the Nawab of Bhopal, who had raided ’Scindia's teritories. While there were some attacks on Bhopal in 1808 and 1812, Wazir Mohammad Khan resisted and managed to prevent Scindia’s forces from capturing the city. In 1814, several more attacks were made, but internal disputes and betrayals hampered Scindia’s efforts. Jean Baptiste, sent by Scindia, quarreled with Jaswant Rao Bhau, leading to the failure of another siege. Some believe Baptiste was swayed by Wazir Mohammad Khan’s overtures. Once again, Scindia’s efforts were thwarted by betrayal. ===First Attack on Bhopal=== Jagoo attacked the north wall of Bhopal, causing huge damage. When Wazir Muhammad Khan arrived with reinforcements, he found two enemy battalions at Wazir-gunj. Hidden artillery fired on them, killing 300. Wazir Muhammad Khan killed 30 enemies, and the enemy fled. The defenders, who had been without food for two days, received a supply of wheat from Ratan Singh of Satanbari. Wazir Muhammad Khan rewarded him. ===Second Attack on Bhopal=== Jagoo attacked the Pir gate with his army, but Wazir Muhammad Khan, hiding his reserves, ambushed the enemy and forced them to retreat. Dewan Gulshan Rai then helped Wazir Muhammad Khan escape. The next day, Mahratta officers criticized Jagoo and launched a new attack with scaling ladders. Wazir Muhammad Khan and Nazir Muhammad Khan, with only 100 men, bravely defended the city, using grenades, rocks, and muskets to repel the attackers. They then broke the ladders, charged out, and defeated the enemy. ===Third Attack on Bhopal=== Nawab Ghaus Muhammad Khan, unable to withstand the hardships of the siege, left the city with Wazir Muhammad Khan. However, they were discovered by the Maratha army before reaching the shrine of Mustan Shah. Raja Bhao, leading 10,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry, attacked them. Despite being outnumbered, Wazir Muhammad Khan and his group charged at the enemy, forcing them to retreat. The Nawab, mounted on his horse near the wall outside the Itwara gate, watched the battle unfold. Syud Khyrudin Hussain, a resident of Gulburkah, was ordered by Wazir Muhammad Khan to fire cannons, which caused panic in the enemy ranks. As night fell, Wazir Muhammad Khan instructed Ikbal Khan Chela to set fire to the ruined houses in the suburbs to prevent the enemy from using them as cover. The Nawab and Wazir Muhammad Khan stayed on the battlefield overnight, remaining on their horses until dawn, when they prayed and then returned to the city. ===Fourth Attack on Bhopal=== When Muhammad Din Khan reported that the Nagpur army had reached the Gunnuri gate and placed scaling ladders against the walls, Wazir Muhammad Khan quickly went to the area with his followers. They fired heavily from the loopholes, and after about an hour of fighting, the enemy was forced to retreat back to their camp. ===Fifth Attack on Bhopal=== Mir Muhammad Akil Khan Majzub, while climbing the bastion of Shujja Khan, claimed it was now in his hands and questioned where he and the bastion would be by the next day. Wazir Muhammad Khan, after noticing mustard seeds moving on the bastion, realized it had been undermined and ordered evacuation. The next morning, the mine exploded, killing many enemy soldiers, who then retreated. Aman Singh brought 200 bullocks with wheat from Amir Muhammad Khan, saving the Bhopali forces from starvation. Meanwhile, Nathu Pindara, carrying grain with 500 horsemen, was challenged by scouts but deceived them by claiming to be reinforcements from Raisen. He was allowed to enter the fort and was honored by Wazir Muhammad Khan before leaving the next morning. ===Sixth Attack on Bhopal=== Wazir Muhammad Khan, feeling discouraged by the long siege, went to visit the hermit Mustan Shah. He laid down his shield and scimitar at Mustan Shah’s feet and told him about his weakness and the strength of his enemies. Mustan Shah gave him back his shield and scimitar, telling him that Heaven, which had sent this trouble, was now helping him again. He encouraged him to fight with trust in divine support. At that moment, Wazir Muhammad Khan received news of Dungar Singh’s betrayal. Dungar Singh, the commander of the Old Fort, had let 1,000 men into the tomb of Nawab Faiz Muhammad Khan. However, Wazir Muhammad Khan’s son, Nazar Muhammad Khan, with help from Syud Hossain, Pirzada, Bukshi Bahadur, Muhammad Khan, Mirza Kamal Beg, and Gholam Mohiuddin, bravely attacked the enemy and successfully drove them out. ===Seventh Attack on Bhopal=== When the gunpowder ran out, Wazir Muhammad Khan sent Mulavi Nizamuddin and Kazi Muhammad Yusaf to Sadiq Ali Khan, proposing peace. However, late at night, Nathu Pindara brought supplies, allowing the fighting to resume, which caused panic among the enemy. The messengers returned, upset that Wazir Muhammad Khan had lied about seeking peace. Later, an old man revealed a hidden stash of gunpowder, allowing Wazir Muhammad Khan to continue the siege. The prolonged battle caused sickness and death in the enemy army, and Sadiq Ali Khan, claiming to have had a dream, left. The Bhopalis were finally relieved from the siege, and Wazir Muhammad Khan and his sons proved their bravery and determination. === Eighth Attack on Bhopal === In February, Dan Singh and Ram Lal launched another strong attack. They pushed forward until they were close to the walls of Bhopal. However, Wazir Mohammad forced Daulat Rao's forces to retreat. In March 1814, Jagoo Bapoo died, but in April, Sadiq Ali, the commander of the Bhonsle, convinced Doongar Singh, an ally of Bhopal, to enter the town. Although he entered, he was not able to win completely. He stopped the siege of Bhopal because he claimed he had a dream telling him to leave and not harm his fellow Muslims. ==End of Hostilities and Aftermath== In 1813, Daulat Rao Scindia's forces, led by Jaswant Rao Bhau, attempted to attack Bhopal, but Jean Baptiste, sent to assist, disagreed with Bhau over troop payments and failed to act. Some believe Baptiste was influenced by Wazir Mohammad, further damaging Sicindia's plans. The British Resident, R. Stratchey, opposed Sindhia's expansion, arguing that Bhopal under Sindhia's control would threaten British interests and other states. As a result, Bhopal was placed under British protection. Sindhia's supporters, Gopal Bhau and Annaji Bhaskar, protested, but the British moved forward. In 1818, Lord Hastings formally took Bhopal and Jhansi under British protection to combat the Pindaris. == References == Category:India",
