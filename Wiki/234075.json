 "text": "The Northern United States, commonly referred to as the American North or simply the North, may be either a geographic or a historical term. Geographically, the term includes the U.S. states and regions of the United States that are located across the northernmost part of the country. It includes but is not limited to states along the Canadaâ€“United States border. == Census Bureau == The United States Census Bureau divides some of the Northern United States into the Midwest Region and the Northeast Region. The Census Bureau also includes the northernmost states of the Northwest, those that are in the West. ==Historical term== Before 19th century westward expansion, the term \"Northern United States\" was considered to be New England. By the 1830s, New England meant part of the Northeastern United States. ===American Civil War=== During the American Civil War, the \"Northern United States\" meant the states that remained in the United States and were also called the Union states. In that context, the \"Southern United States\" meant the states that seceded to form the Confederate States. However, some slave states remained in the Union; called the \"border states,\" they may be counted on either side. == Related pages == *Southeastern United States *Yankee ==References== Category:Census Regions of the United States",
