 "text": "A common year starting on Thursday is a common year that begins on Thursday, January 1, and ends on Thursday, December 31. Thus, its dominical letter is D. Examples include 1970, 1981, 1987, 1998, 2009, 2015, and 2026 in the Gregorian calendar,\"A common year beginning on Thursday\", jonstlouis.htmlplanet.com, 2011, webpage: HTMcal. or, likewise, 1993, 1999, 2010, 2021, and 2027 in the Julian calendar (see bottom tables). In this common year, January and October begin on Thursday, February, March, and November begin on Sunday, April and July begin on Wednesday, May begins on Friday, June begins on Monday, August begins on Saturday and September and December begin on Tuesday. This is the only common year with three occurrences of Friday the 13th, in February, March and November. The other type of year with three occurrences of Friday the 13th is a Leap year starting on Sunday which has three Friday the 13ths in January, April, and July. Additionally, with the exception of skipped leap years, leap years starting on Sunday fall exactly three years either side of two consecutive common years starting on Thursday; the most recent occurrence was 2012 between 2009 and 2015. From February until March in this type of year is also the shortest period (one month) that runs between two instances of Friday the 13th. This common year is one of three common years with two Friday the 17ths, the others being Common year starting on Wednesday and Common year starting on Friday. The Friday the 17ths in this common year are in April and July. Leap years starting on Wednesday share this characteristic, but also have another one in January. If the year following this type of year is a common year, this type of year will have the longest gap (14 months) between two instances of Friday the 17ths, from July of this year to September of the following year. If the following year is a leap year, the gap is reduced to 11 months as the next Friday the 17th is in June. This common year is one of three common years with two Tuesday the 13ths, the others being Common year starting on Friday and Common year starting on Saturday. The Tuesday the 13ths in this common year are in January and October. In this common year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is on January 19, Valentine’s Day is on a Saturday, President's Day is on February 16, Daylight Savings Time begins on its earliest possible date, March 8, Saint Patrick’s Day is on a Tuesday, Memorial Day is on its earliest possible date, May 25, U.S. Independence Day is on a Saturday, Labor Day is on its latest possible date, September 7, Halloween is on a Saturday, Daylight Savings Time ends on its earliest possible date, November 1, Veterans Day is on a Wednesday, Thanksgiving is on November 26, and Christmas is on a Friday. This common year is also the only one where Memorial Day and Labor Day are not 14 weeks (98 days) apart: they are 15 weeks (105 days) apart in this common year. Leap years starting on Wednesday share this characteristic. Like leap years starting on Wednesday, this common year also has the shortest gap between Halloween (October 31) and the end of Daylight Saving Time (November 1) by one day. Prior to 2007, this common year had the longest gap between the end of Daylight Saving Time (October 25) and Halloween by 6 days. The last such year when this occurred was in 1998. This is the only type of year where February is rectangular in areas where Sunday is considered the first day of the week. The other type of year where a rectangular February is possible is Common year starting on Friday in places where Monday is considered the first day of the week. This common year has three months (February, March, and November) beginning on the first day of the week, in areas where Sunday is considered the first day of the week. Leap years starting on Sunday share this characteristic in the months of January, April, and July. In a 400-year cycle in the Gregorian Calendar, 44 or 11% of all years are common years starting on Thursday. Like all common years, they occur in a pattern of 6-11-11 years (e.g. 2009, 2015, 2026, 2037). However, this pattern gets broken when there is a century year that is not a leap year. Over the past 400-year cycle (from 1600 to 2000), there were 6-year gaps between 1693, 1699, 1705 and 1711, 6-year gaps between 1795, 1801 and 1807 and a 12-year gap between 1891 and 1903. In the Julian Calendar there are three common years starting on Thursday in a 28-year cycle. This kind of year has 53 weeks in the ISO 8601 week - day format.
