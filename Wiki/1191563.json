 "text": "Hexagon solar cells are an idea for solar cells that are designed and engineered to be made from 200 mm, 300 mm, or 450 mm silicon wafers.https://www.solarfeeds.com/mag/wiki/solar-wafer/ Hexagon solar cells made this way could be highly engineered using additive manufacturing and subtractive manufacturing techniques on the silicon wafers for higher solar- cell efficiency. Making the solar cells hexagon, better utilizes the circular silicon wafers surface area. Hexagonal solar cells using multi-junction solar cells, quantum dots, and silicon nanowires could achieve efficiency of over 50%.https://patents.google.com/patent/US4089705A/en ==Additive manufacturing techniques== * Inkjet solar cell * Slot-die coating * Chemical vapor deposition * Atomic layer deposition * Quantum dot solar cell ==Subtractive manufacturing techniques== * Reactive-ion etching * Metal assisted chemical etching * Laser ablation ==Advantages== * Multi-junction solar cell * Silicon nanowires * Plasmonic solar cells * Superhydrophobic coatings * Light trapping techniques ==See also== * Thin-film solar * Spin coating * Nanocrystal solar cell * Surface plasmon resonance ==References==",
