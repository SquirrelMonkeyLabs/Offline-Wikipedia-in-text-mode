 "text": "Pop rap, also called hip pop, pop hip hop, melodic hip hop or melodic rap, is a blend of pop music with hip hop. In pop rap music, real hip hop elements are removed and hooks are used to achieve (or get) a friendly sound. Mixing beats and rhythms with powerful (strong) melodic hooks can often be found in their original forms of pop music. This genre became more popular in the 1990s, although pop rap influences and roots can be traced back to late 1980s hip hop artists such as Run-DMC, LL Cool J, and the Beastie Boys. The lyrics are often playful, with choruses similar to ears in pop music. == Features == AllMusic describes pop rap as \"a marriage of hip-hop beats and raps with strong melodic hooks, which are often presented as part of the chorus section in a standard pop song structure\". Pop rap also tends to have less aggressive lyrics than street rap. Pop rap songs often contain pop-like lyrical content on themes of love and relationships. == Famous pop rap artists == * Aaliyah * Ashanti * Akon * Alexandra Reid * Baby Bash * Beyoncé * Black Eyed Peas * Bow Wow * BTS * Cabal * Chris Brown * Diddy * DJ BoBo * Doja Cat * Drake * Fetty Wap * Fergie * Gloria Groove * Iggy Azalea * Jackson Wang * Ja Rule * Jazze Pha * J-Hope * Karol Conká * Kid Ink * Kris Wu * Leigh-Anne Pinnock * Lil Wayne * LL Cool J * Mark Lee * Miley Cyrus * Nelly * Nicki Minaj * Rap Monster * Robert Kelly * Suga * Swizz Beatz * The Neptunes * Tyga * Will.i.am * Wiz Khalifa * Flo Rida == References == Category:Pop music Category:Hip hop",
