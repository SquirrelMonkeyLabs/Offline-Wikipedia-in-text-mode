 "text": "The IUCN Red List (also IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) is a list of species. The list tells for each species how likely it is to become extinct (or if it is already). This is called its conservation status. This list is put together each year by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are exact criteria to see if a certain species is threatened to become extinct. These criteria are the same for all parts of the world. The purpose of the list is to tell people how threatened a certain species is. Politicians can then decide on what needs to be done and the efforts needed to save certain species from becoming extinct. ==Criteria== Not evaluated: Not yet compared to the standard scale. Data deficient: Not enough data. ==Related pages== * Endangered species ==Other websites== *IUCN Red List Website - The species list can be found here.
