 "text": "The 2001 Anthrax attacks were a series of incidents in the United States. The attacks began on September 18, 2001 and lasted for several weeks. Anthrax was spread through the mail. The anthrax spores were put in envelopes and sent to several news media offices and two U.S. senate offices. 22 people were infected. Five people died. It was believed that the person who was responsible for this was Dr. Bruce Edward Ivins. He was a senior biodefense researcher who was employed by the U.S. government. Ivins killed himself in 2008. He was not prosecuted for the crime but the evidence suggests that he acted alone in mailing the envelopes. ==References== Category:2001 crimes Category:2001 in the United States Category:2000s crimes in the United States Category:September 2001 events",
