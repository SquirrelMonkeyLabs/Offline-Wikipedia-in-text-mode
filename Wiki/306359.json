 "text": "A rearrangement reaction is an organic reaction where the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged. The result is a structural isomer of the original molecule. Often a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in the same molecule. In the example below, the substituent R moves from carbon atom 1 to carbon atom 2: Intermolecular rearrangements also take place. : Sometimes chemists draw diagrams with arrows that show how electrons are transferred between bonds during a rearrangement reaction. Many organic chemistry text books have such diagrams. But they do not tell the full story of the reaction mechanism. The actual mechanism of a rearrangement with an alkyl group moving is for the group to slide smoothly along a bond, not ionic bond-breaking and forming. One example of this is the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement: : In pericyclic reactions, the orbital interactions are important. The reactions can not be explained by a series of simple discrete electron transfers. The curved arrows showing a sequence of discrete electron transfers can give the same result as a rearrangement reaction. Yet, the diagrams are not necessarily realistic. In allylic rearrangement, the reaction is ionic. Three important rearrangement reactions are 1,2-rearrangements, pericyclic reactions and olefin metathesis. ==1,2-rearrangements== A 1,2-rearrangement is an organic reaction where a substituent moves from one atom to another atom in a chemical compound. In a 1,2 shift, the substituent moves between two adjacent atoms. Moves over larger distances are possible. Examples are the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement: and the Beckmann rearrangement: ==Pericyclic reactions== A pericyclic reaction is a type of reaction with multiple carbon-carbon bond making and breaking. The transition state of the molecule has a cyclic geometry. The reaction progresses in a concerted fashion. Examples are hydride shifts and the Claisen rearrangement: ==Olefin metathesis== Olefin metathesis is a formal exchange of the alkylidene fragments in two alkenes. It is a catalytic reaction with carbene. It has transition metal carbene complex intermediates. ==References==",
