 "text": "The Meat Puppets are an alternative/punk rock group from Scottsdale, Arizona, USA. They were formed in 1980 by Curt Kirkwood (vocals, guitars), his brother Cris (bass) and Derrick Bostrom (drums). The band is probably best known for their 1994 radio hit \"Backwater\". The band went on indefinite hiatus in 2001 as Curt formed two band projects Eyes Adrift (with Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh) and Volcano (also with Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh). He also released a solo album. His brother Cris was in prison from August 2004 to 21 months. In 2006, the Meat Puppets reformed and released a new album, Rise to Your Knees in 2007. As of November 2009, Shandon Sahm is back as the drummer in the Meat Puppets. He replaces Ted Marcus, who was a member from 2006. The band was chosen by Animal Collective to perform their album Up on the Sun live at the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in May 2011. == References == Category:1980s American music groups Category:1990s American music groups Category:2000s American music groups Category:2010s American music groups Category:American punk bands Category:Musical groups from Arizona Category:Scottsdale, Arizona Category:Musical groups established in 1980 Category:1980 establishments in the United States Category:1990s establishments in Arizona Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1996 Category:1996 disestablishments in the United States Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2002 Category:2002 disestablishments in the United States Category:Disestablishments in Arizona Category:Musical groups established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in the United States Category:2000s establishments in Arizona Category:20th-century establishments in Arizona",
