 "text": "Jaime Balmes (1810–1848) was a Spanish Catholic priest, philosopher, and political writer known for his clear and accessible works on philosophy, religion, and society. == Early life and education == Born in Vic, Catalonia, Spain, on August 28, 1810, Balmes began his studies at the local seminary in 1817, focusing on Latin grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy. In 1825, he received the tonsure and continued his theological studies at the University of Cervera. After the university's closure in 1830, he pursued private studies in Vic and earned his degree in theology in 1833. He was ordained a priest in 1834 and later obtained a Doctorate in Theology and a Bachelor's in Canon Law. == Career and writings == Balmes initially attempted to teach at the University of Barcelona but was unsuccessful. In 1837, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics in Vic, a position he held for four years. His writing career flourished after moving to Barcelona in 1841, where he contributed to various newspapers and magazines, gaining widespread attention. In 1844, he published \"The True Idea of Value,\" addressing the paradox of value and introducing the concept of marginal utility. His most renowned work, \"Protestantism and Catholicity Compared in their Effects on the Civilization of Europe,\" argues that Catholicism promotes order and unity, while Protestantism leads to individualism and societal fragmentation. == Philosophical contributions == Balmes is often associated with \"philosophy of common sense,\" but his ideas are more nuanced. He identified three types of truth: * Subjective truths: Personal experiences, like feeling cold. * Rational truths: Logical and mathematical truths. * Objective truths: Observable facts, like the color of the sky. He emphasized that metaphysics should be built upon all three, rather than relying solely on rationalism. Balmes also highlighted the importance of consciousness and common sense in understanding truth. == Notable works == * El Criterio (1845): A guide to sound reasoning and judgment. * Filosofía Fundamental (1846): A comprehensive work on philosophy. * Curso de Filosofía Elemental (1847): An introductory philosophy course. * Protestantism and Catholicity Compared in their Effects on the Civilization of Europe (1844): A comparative analysis of religious influences on European civilization. == Death and legacy == Balmes died of tuberculosis on July 9, 1848, in his hometown of Vic. He is remembered for his efforts to reconcile faith and reason, and his works continue to influence Catholic thought and philosophy.
