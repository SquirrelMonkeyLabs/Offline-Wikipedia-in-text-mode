At 8 o'clock on the morning of July 14, the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded it to a tropical depression. At this point the system moves to the approximate west. At 8 pm, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center gave its development rating \"low\".

Later that day, Danas began to weaken. On July 20, around 13:00 UTC, Danas made landfall on South Korea as a minimal tropical storm, before weakening into a tropical depression soon afterward. The weakening trend also accelerated on July 20 due to the drop in sea temperature to 23 degrees Celsius near landfall. The Republic of Korea Meteorological Administration downgraded Danas to a tropical depression at 11 am and stopped issuing announcements. At 12:45 UTC on July 21, Danas transitioned into an extratropical low in the Sea of Japan, and the JMA issued their final advisory on the storm. == Impact == === Philippines === On July 15, the system was enhanced to a tropical depression. At 11 pm, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued the No. 1 storm signal to the northern part of Isabela Province, Cagayan Province and the Bataan Islands. As Denas continued to approach Luzon, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued a second storm signal to the northern part of Cagayan Province at 5 pm on the 16th. PAGASA cancelled all storm signals for the Philippines on July 18th. === Japan === Danas brought heavy rainfall to many western parts of Japan including nearly all of Kyushu. In addition, the amount of rain that fell in the last 24 hours exceeded 350 mm in various places in Goto, and reaches the rainfall for July 1 month in normal years, and it has become the largest since July. === Korea === On July 20, around 13:00 UTC, Danas made landfall on South Jeolla Province, South Korea as a minimal tropical storm. It caused heavy rain across the country but damages were unknown.
