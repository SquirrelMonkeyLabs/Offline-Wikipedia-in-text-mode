 "text": "The Peshtigo Fire was a great fire in on October, 8, 1871 in Peshtigo, a town in Wisconsin in the United States. It was a natural disaster. The fire killed between 1,500 people and 2,700 people. Occurring on the same day as the more famous Great Chicago Fire, the Peshtigo Fire has been largely forgotten. The setting of small fires was a common way to clear forest land for farming and railroad construction. On the day of the Peshtigo Fire, a cold front moved in from the west, bringing strong winds that fanned the fires out of control. A huge fire was started. ==References== Category:Fires in the United States Category:Natural disasters in the United States Category:19th century in Wisconsin Category:1871 in the United States",
