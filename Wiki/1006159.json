He was one of the three brothers born to Emperor Jimmu and his wife Himetataraisuzu-hime. (called Kami-ya-wi-mimi in this source) Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto became famous for his involvement in the killing of Tagishimimi. He and his brother Suizei killed Tagishimimi to save Suizei from being assassinated.. In the Kojiki Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto was the older brother of Suizei and was next in line to become the emperor. However, he chose to pass the throne to his younger brother Suizei. This is similar to the story of Yamayukihiko and Umiyukihiko, who also made an \"oath of subordination\" to each other.. Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto has a connection with Aso Shrine, where a deity named Takeban Ryujin (Taikei Watatsu) is enshrined.

According to the Kojiki, Kamuyaimi-no- Mikoto not only established the Emperor System but also appointed Takeiotatsu no Mikoto, his grandson, as the national governor.

Additionally, the palace of Shikinomizugaki, which is in Nara Prefecture, was built during the reign of the 10th Emperor Sujin. It is believed that Kamuyaimi-no-Mikoto's family followed the four provincial generals, Ohiko-no-mikoto. The Shinano-no-kuninomiyatsukos were likely buried in the Mori Shogunzuka burial mound, located on the opposite side of the Kawayanagi Shogunzuka burial mound..
