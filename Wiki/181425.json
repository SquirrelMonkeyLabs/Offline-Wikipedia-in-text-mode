 "text": "The Jacobins were a group of radicalists who supported The French Revolution. Their leader was Maximilien de Robespierre, and they were in power of the French government from June of 1793 to July of 1794. Initially founded in 1789 by anti-royalist deputies from Brittany, the club grew into a nationwide republican movement, with a membership estimated at a half million or more. Members of the Jacobins would often belong to mainly to the less prosperous section of the society (the working class). They included shopkeepers, artisans, cooks, shoemakers and daily wage workers. They dressed differently by wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by dock workers. Category:French Revolution",
