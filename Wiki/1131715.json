 "text": "The brasero is a metal container in which a fire is made or embers are placed in it to heat the interior of homes . Any place where there are burning coals is also called a brasero. Modernly, certain deposits of burning embers, such as the upper compartment of solid fuel heating boilers, are called braseros. Vida y peregrinaci√≥n: Ministerio de Cultura, 1993. ISBN 8474839432. There are some risks attached to the traditional, charcoal-heated brasero. The embers can burn the fabric or the clothes of the users, causing a fire. Given that braseros are covered, combustion can occur with small quantities of oxygen, and instead of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide can be generated. Carbon monoxide poisoning can kill victims in their sleep, especially in poorly ventilated rooms. In South America, notably Argentina, a brasero is a small grill attached to a box with coals used to serve sizzling hot meats at an asado. == References == == Other websites == * Brief photographic documentation (with further web references) Category:Home Category:HVAC",
