 "text": "The Axeman of New Orleans was an American serial killer active in New Orleans, Louisiana from May 1918 to October 1919. The killer was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved. The victims usually were attacked with an axe, which often belonged to the victims themselves. In most cases, a panel on a back door of a home was removed by a chisel, which were both left on the floor near the door, followed by an attack on one or more of the residents with either an axe or straight razor. ==Notes== ==Other websites== *Vice interview of Miriam C.
