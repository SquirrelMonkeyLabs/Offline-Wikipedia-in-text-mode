 "text": "A cantaloupe (also known as a muskmelon, rockmelon, sweet melon or spanspek or spelled \"canteloupe\", \"cantalope\" or \"cantelope\") is a type of fruit. It is a muskmelon that is probably related to the watermelon. There are two types of cantaloupe, European and North American. Cantaloupes range in size from 0.5 to 5.0 kilograms (1.1 to 11 lb). == Types of cantaloupe == * The European cantaloupe is oblong with a light green skin. * The North American cantaloupe is round with a thin light brown skin. The flesh of the fruit is firm, orange and sweet. ==Nutrition== Cantaloupes are a source of polyphenol antioxidants. These are chemicals which were thought to provide certain health benefits to the cardiovascular and immune systems by regulating the formation of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a key chemical in promoting health of the endothelium and prevention of heart attacks. However, recent research has indicated they do not benefit the body. The body already has ways to deal with oxidation. Cantaloupes also are an excellent source of vitamin C. Dirty cantaloupes can spread bacteria. In 2011, 21 people died in the United States from cantaloupes having listeria bacteria. The bad cantaloupes were traced back from around the country to a single farm in Colorado.Multistate Outbreak of Listeriosis Linked to Whole Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms, Colorado ==References== == Other websites == * Nutritional and Historical Information * MSNBC Article on Farming of Hybridization That Mentions Cantaloupes Category:Melons",
