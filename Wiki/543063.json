 "text": "The national flag of Chile was adopted in 1817. == Appearance == The flag shows two equally horizontal bands of white (top right); and red (bottom). There is a blue square (left of the white band). The squrare is the same height as the white band. The square shows a white five-pointed star in the center. Protocol dictates that it can hang horizontally or vertically, but the star must always be located in the top-left corner. The colors have meanings: * Red: represents the blood of Chilean patriots who fought for independence. * White: represents the snow of the Andes mountains. * Blue: represents the blue of the skies. * White star: stresses the fact that Chile is an unitarian republic. (a political system in which the central government controls its republic). Note: the Chilean flag is similar to the flag of the American state of Texas. == Related pages == * Chile * Chilean government * unitary state * unitary * republic == Other websites == * Description in Flags of the World Chile Category:National symbols of Chile",
