It became the resident ballet company of the Royal Opera House in 1946, and was granted a Royal Charter in 1956. It is recognised as Britain's flagship national ballet company. The Royal Ballet employs about 100 dancers and has purpose built facilities in the Royal Opera House. The official school of the company is the Royal Ballet School, and The Royal Birmingham Ballet is an associate company.
