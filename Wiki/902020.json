 "text": "The Mexican Dirty War () is about an internal conflict in the 1960s and 1980s between the Mexican PRI government under the presidencies of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Luis Echeverría and José López Portillo and left-wing student and guerrilla groups. They were supported by the United States. During the war, government forces carried out disappearances, about 1,200, torture, and executions. In March 2019, the President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador, publicly released the archives which had new information about the Dirty War. López Obrador said that \"We lived for decades under an authoritarian regime which limited freedoms and persecuted those who struggled for social change\" and issued an official apology on behalf of the Mexican State to the victims. ==References== Category:1970s in Mexico Category:1960s in Mexico Category:1980s in Mexico",
