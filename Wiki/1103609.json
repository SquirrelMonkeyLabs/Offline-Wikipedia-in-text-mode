 "text": "The Yugoslav government-in-exile was the government of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in exile in Allied countries in World War II. == History == After the Yugoslav coup in March 1941, the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in 11 days. The government went into exile in Greece, then Palestine, then Egypt, and then the United Kingdom. Resistance happened in the occupied regions of the country. The resistance groups were the Chetniks and the communist Partisans. The Chetniks collaborated with the Axis powers to fight the partisans. So the Allies stopped supporting the Chetniks and started supporting the partisans. After the war, the exiled government dissolved and the communist Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was formed. == Leaders == * Peter II (as king) * Dušan Simović (as prime minister) (1941–1942) Category:History of Yugoslavia Category:20th century in Europe",
