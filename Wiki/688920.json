 "text": "The 2020 presidential campaign of Eric Swalwell, the U.S. Representative from California's 15th congressional district, began on April 8, 2019, when it was announced on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Swalwell also posted a campaign ad on his social media accounts the same day he announced his candidacy. He was the third Californian to run for president, behind Senator Kamala Harris and spiritual author Marianne Williamson. If he was elected, Swalwell would be the youngest president in American history; the first millennial president; the first president with student debt; the first president from the San Francisco Bay Area; the first president from California since Ronald Reagan; and the first president who was in the House of Representatives before becoming president since James A. Garfield in 1881. Swalwell ended his campaign on July 8, 2019. ==References== Swalwell",
