 "text": "\"Set Fire to the Rain\" is the second hit song from Adele's second album 21. It was her third number-one single in the United States. It hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100, becoming her third song to do so. It reached number 12 on the year- end chart of 2012 in the US. It has also been certified quadruple-Platinum for shipments of over four million copies in the US. ==Music video== No proper music video was shot for \"Set Fire to the Rain\" (as well as other singles from 21, \"Rumor Has It\" and \"Turning Tables\") as Adele had recently undergone vocal surgery. Instead, a live performance video was uploaded to her Vevo account and has received more than 380 million views as of October 2017. == Awards == Year Ceremony Category Result 2013 55th Annual Grammy Awards Best Pop Solo Performance ==Credits and personnel== Credits are taken from 21 liner notes. * Adele – Songwriting, vocals * Fraser T.
