 "text": "The Welsh Wikipedia (Welsh: Wicipedia Cymraeg or just Wicipedia) is the Welsh- language edition of Wikipedia. This edition started in July 2003. As of January 2025, it has more than 280,000 articles. Wikipedia is one of a small number of multilingual websites where Welsh has a significant presence. In the view of the Welsh government, the Welsh Wikipedia \"helps to increase social capital and encourages more writing in Welsh\". Welsh Wikipedia provides a rich source of information which translation tools like Google Translate are trained on; Gareth Morlais suggests that the Welsh Wikipedia's growth has contributed to the improved machine translation. ==References== ==Other websites== *Welsh Wikipedia main page Category:Wikipedias Category:Websites established in 2003",
