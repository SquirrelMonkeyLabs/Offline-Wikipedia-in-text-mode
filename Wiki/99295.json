 "text": "This article is about the constructed languages of J. R. R. Tolkien, which he used in his books about the Middle-earth fictional universe. == History == J. R. R. Tolkien was a philologist, and he was interested in language since he was a child. He invented several languages to use in his Middle-earth writings. Aside from the external history, most of his languages have also an invented \"internal history\". This describes how the languages evolved and were spoken inside the fictional story. Some of Tolkien's languages have a detailed grammar and vocabulary. Other languages are not very detailed, and some have only a few words and names. Quenya and Sindarin are the best- and most- developed languages, while others like Rohirric, Khuzdûl, or Black Speech are simpler. Tolkien also created the Tengwar, Sarati, and Cirth scripts for his languages. == Languages of Middle-earth == === Elvish languages === The Elvish languages or Eldarin languages are used by Elves in the Middle-earth universe. At times, Elvish languages were the common speech. Later humans also used the Elvish language, especially scientists and the nobility. The Eldarin languages can be divided into two groups: Quenya and the Telerin languages (which includes Telerin, Nandorin, and Sindarin). ==== Quenya ==== Quenya was spoken by the Vanyar and Noldor elves in Valinor. When the Noldor returned to Middle- earth in the First Age, they brought Quenya with them. But the native Sindarin became far more common in everyday speech. In the Second Age and especially in the Third Age, Quenya in Middle-earth was used more as a scientific and ritual language. Because of this, Tolkien sometimes called Quenya the \"Elf-Latin\". ==== Telerin ==== Telerin was spoken by the Teleri elves. From Telerin developed several new languages and dialects, like Sindarin. ==== Sindarin ==== The Sindarin dialect came from Telerin. It was spoken by the Sindar (or Grey Elves) in Middle-earth. It later became the most common elvish language spoken in Middle-earth. === Mannish (Human) languages === ==== Adûnaic ==== Adûnaic is the language of the people of Númenor. After the Fall of Númenor, Adûnaic was not often used anymore. Westron developed from Adûnaic and the native languages of the western coastlands of Middle-earth. ==== Westron ==== Westron (Westron: Adûni, Sindarin: Annúnaid), or the Common Speech (Westron: Sôval Phârë), is a language of Middle-earth. It comes from Adûnaic and the native languages of Middle-earth. In the Third Age, Westron is the common language, spoken by most peoples. In the books, the text written in English is meant to be Westron most of the time. ==== Rohirric ==== Rohirric (also called Rohirian or Rohanese) is the language of the Rohirrim of Rohan. In the books, Rohirric text and names are always represented by Old English. This is because Rohirric should feel older but similar to the hobbit's Westron, and they are in the books represented by Old English and Modern English. === Khuzdûl === Khuzdûl is the language of the Dwarves. The dwarves keep much of their language and what they do a secret. Because of this, only a few place-names and phrases are known from Khuzdûl. Dwarves have never told other (non- dwarven) people their Khuzdûl names. Instead, they use other names when talking to the other peoples of Middle-earth. The dwarven \"nicknames\" that appear in the books are all taken from Norse mythology. Besides the spoken language, called aglab, Khuzdûl had the iglishmek, which was a sign language. === Entish === Entish is the language of the Ents. The language is, like the Ents themselves, very \"unhasty\": it takes a lot of time to say something. The language uses very long descriptions and many repetitions. Because it is so complicated and takes so much time, nobody but the Ents use or understand this language. === Valarin === Valarin was the language spoken by the Ainur. === Black Speech === Black Speech is the language of Sauron. He created the language and his followers used it. The inscription on the One Ring was Black Speech, written in Tengwar. Aside from the Ring-inscription, there are several names and words of Black Speech known. ==Related pages== *Middle-earth *Tengwar Languages Category:Fictional languages",
