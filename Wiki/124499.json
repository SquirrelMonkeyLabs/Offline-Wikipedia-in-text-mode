 "text": "Libra (, , symbol , Unicode ) is a constellation of the zodiac. It lies between Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east. It once represented the claws of Scorpius. == Some features == The brightest stars in Libra form a rectangle: * α Librae, Zubenelgenubi (\"southern claw\"), a visual binary; * β Librae, Zubeneschamali (\"northern claw\"); * γ Librae, Zubenelakrab (\"scorpion's claw\"); * σ Librae, Brachium an eclipsing variable. α and β Librae are the scales' balance beam, and γ and σ are the weighing pans. σ Librae was formerly known as γ Scorpii even though it is well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not renamed as σ Librae until 1851 (by Benjamin A. Gould). Category:Constellations Category:Constellations listed by Ptolemy",
