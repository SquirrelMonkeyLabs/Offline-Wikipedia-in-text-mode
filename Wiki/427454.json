 "text": "Titanic II is a disaster-drama movie from 2010 produced by Shane Van Dyke and distributed by The Asylum.Titanic 2 Sets Sail , The Asylum, May 2010. It is not a sequel to the movie from 1997. Certain movie websites, however, say this movie may be a mock of the 1997 hit movie. The movie Titanic II is about the SS Titanic II luxury liner sent on a maiden voyage exactly 100 years after the original RMS Titanic, except the Titanic II is operating in reverse opposite the original ship. The more recent ship exits New York City and heads to United Kingdom at Southampton. Like the earlier ship, however, she crashes into an iceberg, killing most of the ship's passengers and crew. Only a handful of people survive. Titanic II was condemned by many critics as a rip- off of James Cameron's 1997 movie. The criticisms involved mostly plot and movie directions. == References == == Other websites == * * * Titanic II at The Asylum Category:Movies based on real life events Category:Disaster movies Category:2010 drama movies Category:American drama movies Category:Movies set on ships Category:RMS Titanic",
