 "text": "The 2017 Catalan independence referendum () is a independence referendum that occurred in Catalonia on 1 October 2017. Political parties that do not want independence will boycott the referendum. The referendum is illegal according to the Spanish constitution. The Constitutional Court of Spain suspended the referendum on 7 September 2017. The Catalonia government said the court order was not valid, and got support from 750 of 948 municipalities. This led to the 2017 Spanish constitutional crisis. The Government of Spain opposes Catalan independence. However, the Catalan government says it has the right to independence. Catalonia has not gotten any international support. == References == == Other websites == *Catalan independence referendum, 2017 *Catalonia Votes Category:2017 in Europe Category:2010s in Spain Category:October 2017 events Category:Referendums",
