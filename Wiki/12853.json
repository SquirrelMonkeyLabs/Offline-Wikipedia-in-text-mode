Menem was the first Argentine president to visit Israel. He was a supporter of Peronist ideas. After he moved to Chile, Argentina tried to extradite him. In 2005, he became Senator for La Rioja. In 2003, he ran for president again and narrowly won the first round of the election. However he dropped out of the race after seeing that Néstor Kirchner would beat him in the second round. Some Argentines believe that his name brings bad luck, something that Menem also believed. On 15 December 2020, he was hospitalized in Buenos Aires for a urinary tract infection. On 24 December, he suffered from kidney failure and was in a coma. Menem died on 14 February 2021 from problems caused by the infection, aged 90. ==References== ==Other websites== * Biography and tenure by CIDOB Foundation *Launch of new faction (from the BBC) *Chile declines extradition request (from the BBC) *Menem arrives on Argentine soil (from the BBC) Category:1930 births Category:2021 deaths Category:Deaths from renal failure Category:Deaths from urinary tract infection Category:Presidents of Argentina Category:Argentine lawyers Category:Peronists",
