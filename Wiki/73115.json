 "text": "A spoke is one of several rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface. The term originally meant the portions of a log which one had split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape. Eventually, the term spoke was applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work. == Other websites == These pages are in German: *Hub dynamo assembly instructions with spoke length formula and a nice diagram *Online spoke length calculator, uses slightly different measures than the above formula Category:Engineering",
