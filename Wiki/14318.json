It is the only borough of New York City not on an island. The name came from Bronck's Farms, owned by a settler called Jonas Bronck. The Bronx was once the southern part of Westchester County, but is now one of the five boroughs of New York City as well as a county in New York State called Bronx County. The Bronx River flows south out of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, New York, through the middle of The Bronx, and into Long Island Sound.https://www.hudsonriver.org/wp- content/uploads/2021/11/BR_WLIS_RFS_10-29-21.pdf The Bronx is also known for its extreme crime rate in comparison to other parts of New York City. Two places to visit in The Bronx are the Bronx Zoo and the Yankee Stadium, where the New York Yankees baseball team plays. == Related pages == * South Bronx == References == == Other websites == * * * I Love The Bronx * The Bronx Zoo * The New York Botanical Garden * Wave Hill: New York Public Garden and Cultural Center * Arthur Avenue (Little Italy) Category:County seats in New York (state) Category:1898 establishments in the United States Category:1890s establishments in New York (state)",
