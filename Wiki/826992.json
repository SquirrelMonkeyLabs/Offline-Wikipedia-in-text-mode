 "text": "Menhit or Mehyt was an ancient Egyptian goddess. In the Early Dynastic period Egyptians drew and carved her to look like a lioness lying down with three bent poles coming out of her back. She is shown on many early dynastic sealings and ivory artifacts, usually next to a picture of an Upper Egyptian shrine. People worshiped her in Hierakonpolis and Thinis. ==References== Category:Egyptian gods and goddesses",
