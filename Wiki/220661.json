 "text": "Butterfly gardening is a growing school of gardening, that is aimed at creating an environment that attracts butterflies, as well as some moths. Butterfly gardening is often done to invite those butterflies and moths to lay eggs as well. In addition to the planting of flowers that feed butterflies, other methods of attracting them are building \"butterfly houses\", with sand for puddling, water to drink, and food items, like rotten fruit.
