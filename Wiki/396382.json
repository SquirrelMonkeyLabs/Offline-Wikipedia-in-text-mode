 "text": "Anke Christina Fischer (née Engelke; born 21 December 1965 in Montréal) is a German comedian, actress and voice-over actress. == Life == Engelke moved to Cologne in 1971 with her parents. Early on, she exhibited singing talent, and was discovered in 1978 by Georg Bossert at a performance of her school's choir. In May 2011, she hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in Düsseldorf alongside Stefan Raab and Judith Rakers. The following year, Engelke served as the spokesperson for Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 held in Baku, Azerbaijan. Before presenting the votes, she also gave a live statement on the human-rights issues in the hosting country, saying: \"Tonight nobody could vote for their own country. But it is good to be able to vote. And it is good to have a choice. Good luck on your journey, Azerbaijan. Europe is watching you.\" She was the only spokesperson to articulately address human rights during the event. She had also served as one of Germany's national juries for the contest during that year. In February 2013, her involvement with the Eurovision Song Contest continued as she hosted Unser Song für Malmö, the German national final. ==Filmography== ===Movie=== Year Film Role Notes 2000 LiebesLuder Christine 2001 Der Schuh des Manitu Mutter (extended edition) The Little Polar Bear Mutter Eisbär (voice) 2003 Operation Dance Sensation Veronica Rell Just Get Married!
