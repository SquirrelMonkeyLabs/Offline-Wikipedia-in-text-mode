 "text": "The Queen's Gambit Declined is a chess opening which starts with 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6. It is an old opening, and one of the most important. It is often used in top-class play. In this opening, called QGD for short, the struggle for the centre is the strategy of both players. Unlike the Queen's Gambit Accepted, Black keeps his pawn on d5 protected. A simple example: :1.d4 d5 :2.c4 e6 :3.Nc3 Nf6 :4.Bg5 Be7 :5.e3 0-0 :6.Nf3 c6 :7.cxd5 exd5 :8.Bd3 Nbd7 (Black could play 8...Ne4 here) :9.0-0 h6 :10.Bh4 Here White has more space, and Black has to decide how to develop his pieces. It is easier to play the white pieces in this kind of position. However, overall, black players do as well with this defence as with most others. Best for Black in this position is 10...Ne4 or 10...Re8. Category:Chess openings",
