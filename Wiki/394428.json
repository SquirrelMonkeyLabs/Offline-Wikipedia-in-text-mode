 "text": "Tigrosa helluo is a large species of American wolf spider. It used to be classified as a member of the genus Hogna, and was called Hogna helluo. Before that it was classified as Lycosa helluo. Female Tigrosa helluo spiders can have body lengths as great as 21 mm, and males can get up to 12 mm.Benjamin Julian Kaston, How to Know the Spiders, p. 195. Sometimes the females are found in holes under rocks. They dig a shallow hole and line it with silk. When they lay eggs they put them in silk sacs that they make. Then they carry them along with them by attaching the egg sac to their spinnerets. They may lay from 150 to 500 eggs at a time.Benjamin Julian Kaston, Spiders of Connecticut, p. 327. All mother wolf spiders let their babies ride on top of their abdomens for several days after they hatch. ==References== Category:Lycosidae",
