 "text": "Allobates melanolaemus is a frog species native to Peru. The species is diurnal (Active during the day). It is located in Loreto Province in rainforests commonly found 200 meters above sea level. It lives near streams, but unlike other frogs in the same genus, it sometimes goes partway into the forest; as far as 25 m away from streams. == Conservation == Scientists think the frog could live in one protected park: Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area but have yet to formally record its presence there. ==Young== Scientists think the female frogs lay eggs on the dead leaves on the ground and that, after the eggs hatch, the adult frog carries the tadpoles to streams, like other frogs in Allobates do. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
