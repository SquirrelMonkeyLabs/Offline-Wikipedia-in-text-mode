May God uphold thee, We lay our future in thy hand; United, free for liberty together we'll always stand. II Oh, Uganda! The land of freedom, Our love and labour we give; And with neighbours all at our country's call In peace and friendship we'll live. III Oh, Uganda! The land that feeds us, By sun and fertile soil grown; For our own dear land, we shall always stand, The Pearl of Africa's Crown. ==References== Category:African anthems Category:Uganda",
