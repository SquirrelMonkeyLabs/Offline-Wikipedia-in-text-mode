 "text": "Walter Frazier Jr. (born March 29, 1945 in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American former basketball player in the National Basketball Association. Frazier is very well known by the nickname Clyde as well as the much lesser known nickname Mr. Cool. He was raised in Southern Illinois. As their floor general, he led the New York Knicks to the franchise's only two championships (1970 and 1973), and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. Upon his retirement from basketball, Frazier went into broadcasting. He is currently a color commentator for telecasts of Knicks games on the MSG Network. Frazier is thought of as one of the greatest point guards of all time, and particularly one of the greatest defensive guards as well. He was noted for his very quick hands, and it is claimed that he once stole the ball on eight consecutive plays in a 1971 game against Atlanta (steals were not an official statistic at the time). At one point Frazier held the single-game championship round record for assists when he scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds (and a claimed 6 steals) in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals. Frazier is also a spokesman for Just for Men hair products, often starring alongside baseball player Keith Hernandez. == References == ==Other websites== * NBA Encyclopedia * Basketball Hall of Fame profile *Georgia Sports Hall of Fame * Walt Frazier (in the New Georgia Encyclopedia) * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:New York Knicks players Category:Cleveland Cavaliers players Category:Sportspeople from Illinois Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta Category:National Basketball Association players with retired numbers Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees",
