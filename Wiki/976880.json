 "text": "\"The Royal Anthem of Jordan\" () is the national and royal anthem of Jordan. ==Lyrics== Arabic original Romanisation IPA transcription English translation I ùÑÜ Long live the King! ùÑá His position sublime, His banners waving in glory supreme. II We achieved our goal, On the day you revived for us, A revolution gives us our motivation! Flying over the shoulders of the highest comets. O king of Arabs, From the best prophet you have. The honour of dynasty, Talked about in the depths of books! III All the youthful men, Are your armed armies His determination never dies out! Getting from your meaning a symbol of well- being! IV May you stay the light and the guide, A master in being away of all sins and wrong-doing, Living your life happily and well-respected! Under your flag rests the glory of Arabs. ==References== Jord Category:Jordanian culture Jord",
