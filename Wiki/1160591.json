 "text": "Valentín Elizalde Valencia (Spanish: [balenˈtin eliˈsalde βaˈlensja]; 1 February 1979 – 25 November 2006) was a regional Mexican singer. Nicknamed \"El Gallo de Oro\" (The Golden Rooster), he was known for his off-key style. His biggest hits included: \"Vete Ya,\" \"Ebrio de Amor\", and \"Soy Así\" (a cover of José José's classic song). Some of his songs were narcocorridos eulogizing Mexican drug lords like Vicente Carrillo Fuentes. He also wrote lyrics honoring Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. He was murdered as he left a performance; allegedly by members of the drug trafficking cartel Los Zetas. In 2007, following his passing, his albums were best-selling, even though none of them made it into the top 20 when he was alive. Elizalde was posthumously nominated for a Grammy Award in 2007 for Best Banda Album. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Mexican singers Category:Mexican people",
