 "text": "A political spectrum is a way to talk about different political positions and how they are similar to or different from other political positions. These positions sit upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensions. Traditionally, the political spectrum has people who support left-wing ideas on the left and people who support right-wing ideas on the right. The Political Compass is like the Political Spectrum but it also asks if people are libertarian or authoritarian. Category:Elections",
