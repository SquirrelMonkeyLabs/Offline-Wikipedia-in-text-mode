 "text": "Polydipsia is excessive thirst or excess drinking. The word derives from the Greek πολυδίψιος (poludípsios) \"very thirsty\", which is gotten from πολύς (polús, \"much, many\") + δίψα (dípsa, \"thirst\"). Polydipsia is a symptom in many diseases. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some animals, such as in birds. == Causes == === Diabetes === Polydipsia can be a symptom of diabetes mellitus. It is seen in cases of poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetes insipidus can also cause polydipsia. === Other physiological causes === It can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia, decreased blood volume, and other conditions that create water deficiency. == Diagnosis == Polydipsia is a symptom and not a disease in itself. Polydipsia investigations at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful. == References == Category:Symptoms",
