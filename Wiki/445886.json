 "text": "Olympic Hockey Nagano '98 is an ice hockey game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 1998. It is a re-release of Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey, but not endorsed by Wayne Gretzky. This game has the license for the 1998 Winter Olympics that were in Nagano, Japan. The game is very similar to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey. The only real differences are the box art, in-game titles, and some minor graphic changes (such as team logos and colors).http://ign64.ign.com/objects/002/002309.html Worst Rated IGN Game Ever.
