 "text": "B cells are lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Once the B cell is activated, it turns into a plasma cell, and starts producing antibodies. They are a vital part of the adaptive immune system. They have a protein on the B cell's outer surface known as a 'B cell receptor'. This allows a B cell to bind to a specific antigen. The main functions of B cells are: #to make antibodies against antigens, #to perform the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), #to develop into memory B cells after activation by antigen interaction. Recently, a new, suppressive function of B cells has been discovered. In mammals, immature B cells are formed in the bone marrow, hence their name.Alberts B. et al 2002.
