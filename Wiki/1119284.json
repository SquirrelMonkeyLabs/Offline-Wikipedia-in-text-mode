The first episode was shown on February 18, 2022, replacing 205 Live. NXT Level Up aired directly following SmackDown and at the same time as All Elite Wrestling's show AEW Rampage. On December 20, 2024, it was announced that NXT Level Up was canceled. The last episode aired the following Friday. Starting on January 3, 2025, SmackDown was expanded to three hours, therefore replacing NXT Level Up on their weekly TV schedule. == References == == Other websites == * * * Category:2022 American television series debuts Category:2020s American television series Category:World Wrestling Entertainment television programs",
