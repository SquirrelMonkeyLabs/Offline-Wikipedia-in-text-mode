 "text": "In earthquake engineering, vibration control is a set of technical means for decreasing seismic loads and improving seismic performance of building structures. == Types of vibration control devices == All vibration control devices may be classified as passive, active or hybrid. The first kind is the simplest one and, therefore, widespread. Passive control devices represent different types of base isolators and seismic dampers. Base isolators restrict penetration of potentially damaging seismic waves into a building structure while dampers decrease destructive effect of those waves. ==Other websites== * ==References== Category:Earthquake engineering Category:Mechanical vibrations",
