 "text": "A volume in bibliography is a single book in a series of many books of the same topic. These may be hand-written or printed. most volumes are labeled in order of sequence, labeled in either Roman numerals or Arabic numerals. Volumes may be published by the intent of the author, or they may be created from many bound issues (A single publishing of a numbered arranged publication). For an example of the latter, a library might bind the issues of a periodical newspaper or periodical journal into volumes. the word volume could also be used for an issue of a single periodical newspaper, journal, or magazine. A publisher may on its own publish a volume out of earlier published issues; common in graphic novels. A volume may be made up of entries, as in an encyclopedia, or chapters, as in a monograph.
