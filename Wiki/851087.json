It was once one of the best-selling Chinese language newspapers in Hong Kong. 壹傳媒有限公司 According to the information released by Next Digital, \"Apple Daily\" was the second best-selling Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong. On 24 June 2021, the newspaper was forced to shutdown for violating a national security law. In June last year, Beijing implemented a sweeping new security law - despite much criticism and protest. The law gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech, though China has said it will return stability. Just months after the law was implemented, Lai and a handful of other media figures and activists were arrested and the Apple Daily officers were raided. Police also detained its chief editor and four other executives. The freezing of company accounts meant the paper no longer had money to pay its staff and run daily operations. ==References== Category:Newspapers in Asia",
