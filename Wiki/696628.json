 "text": "Wonder Stories is an early American science fiction magazine. It was published under several titles from 1929 to 1955. Hugo Gernsback started the magazine after he had lost control of his first science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories. Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories were merged in 1930 as Wonder Stories. The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold Wonder Stories to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled Thrilling Wonder Stories, it continued for nearly 20 years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, and the title was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines. The editors under Gernsback's ownership were David Lasser, who worked hard to improve the quality of the fiction, and, from mid-1933, Charles Hornig. ==Publication history== ===Gernsback era=== Air Wonder Stories Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 1929 1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 1/6 1930 1/7 1/8 1/9 1/10 1/11 Volume and issue numbers of Air Wonder Stories.

Editors are Mort Weisinger (green, 1936–1941), Oscar Friend (pink, 1941–1944), and Sam Merwin (purple, 1945). Underlining indicates that an issue was titled as a quarterly (e.g. \"Winter 1944\") rather than as a monthly. Pines' magazines included several with \"Thrilling\" in the title, such as Thrilling Detective and Thrilling Love Stories.Ashley, Time Machines, p. 100. The title was changed to Thrilling Wonder Stories to match the rest of the \"Thrilling\" line. The first issue appeared in August 1936—four months after the last Gernsback Wonder Stories appeared.
