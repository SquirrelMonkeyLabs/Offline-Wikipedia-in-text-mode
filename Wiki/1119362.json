 "text": "The honey-buzzards are genus Pernis. They look something like Buteo buzzards. They feed on wasp nests and larvae. There are various species: European or Eurasian Honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus) Oriental honey buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus) Barred honey-buzzard (Pernis celebensis) Black honey buzzard (Henicopernis infuscatus) Long-tailed honey buzzard (Henicopernis longicauda) They can kill giant hornets with heat, so really the wasp nests really have no effective defences against their attacks. An interesting feature is that their beaks are bent at the end, which helps them pick up caterpillars. Category:Accipitriformes",
