 "text": "\"Maayavi\" is a Tamil-language song from the 2012 Indian superhero movie Mugamoodi, directed by Mysskin. The song was composed by K (Krishna Kumar), with lyrics penned by Madhan Karky and vocals performed by Chinmayi Sripaada. The song features Pooja Hegde. Released as part of the movie's soundtrack album on 1 August 2012, by UTV Music and Saregama, \"Maayavi\" is a melodious track that reflects the emotional depth of the movie's narrative, particularly from the perspective of a character longing for a superhero figure. The song was also dubbed in Telugu as part of the movie's Telugu release, Mask, on under Aditya Music. == Production == \"Maayavi\" was composed by K, marking his second collaboration with director Mysskin after their work on Yuddham Sei (2011). Unlike the fast-paced numbers typical of Mysskin's earlier movies, \"Maayavi\" is one of two melodies in the album, as noted by lyricist Madhan Karky, who wrote the song to evoke a sense of longing and mystique. The recording of \"Maayavi\" took place as part of the broader soundtrack production in early 2012. == Music video == The filming of \"Maayavi\" occurred in Europe, with the song being shot in scenic locales, including Switzerland, during late July 2012. This schedule was part of a ten-day shoot that also included the song \"Vaayamoodi Summa Iru Da\". Choreographed by Radhika, the picturization featured lead actors Jiiva and Pooja Hegde. == Release and Reception == The track was released on 1 August 2012 as the lead single from the album, through Saregama. K performed the song at the movie's audio launch. The Telugu version of the song titled \"Maayavi\" was released on 15 August 2012. The song received positive reviews upon its release. == References == Category:2012 songs Category:Pooja Hegde songs",
