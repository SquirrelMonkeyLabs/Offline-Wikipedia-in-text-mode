The song was able to make it to #40 on the Billboard Hot 100 and is certified Gold by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV). Lil Yachty said he made the song as a troll after he was drinking some wock and saw someone else was drinking a Poland Spring water. Wock means Wockhardt, a brand of cough syrup which is popularly used in the drug lean. The song was praised as catchy and unique with the lyric \"I took the wock to Poland\" being singled out and becoming viral. On October 11, 2022, a music video for the song was released. It was produced by Cole Bennett. In the video, Yachty is seen rapping on the streets of Manhattan and the New York City Subway. The train car has a giant bottle of Wockhardt taped to the back of it. On October 12, 2022, Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki texted Quality Control Music CEO Pierre Thomas and invited Yachty to come to Poland. ==References== ==Other websites== *\"Poland\" on YouTube Category:2022 songs Category:Hip hop songs Category:Songs about drugs",
