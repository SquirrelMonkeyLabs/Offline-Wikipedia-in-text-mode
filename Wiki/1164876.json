 "text": "The Supreme Court of Nigeria is the highest court in Nigeria located in the Central District, Abuja. On the proposal of the National Judicial Council (NJC), the President appoints the Chief Justice of Nigeria and a maximum of 21 judges to the Supreme Court, which must be confirmed by the Senate. To be eligible to practice law in Nigeria, justices of the Supreme Court must have at least fifteen years of legal practice experience. According to the 1999 constitution, the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over all lower federal courts as well as the highest state courts. It also has the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to consider appeals from the Court of Appeal. The court's rulings are binding on all Nigerian courts, with the exception of the Supreme Court. In 1963, Nnamdi Azikiwe was elected as the first president of the newly established Federal Republic of Nigeria. == Related pages == Supreme Court Act 1990 == References == == other websites == * Category:Nigeria Category:Courts (law)",
