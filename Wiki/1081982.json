 "text": "Timurid architecture was an important period of the history of Iran and Central Asia during the late 14th and 15th centuries. The Timurid Empire which conquered most of Central Asia built many palaces, mausoleums, and temples around the region. The style is made to look distinct by how big the architecture is, the luxurious decoration in the tilework, and the geometry. This style, along with other styles of Timurid art, spread over the empire and it inspired many styles of architecture for other empires in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent.
