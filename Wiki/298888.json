 "text": "St Dennis is a parish and village in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The village is on the B3279 road between Newquay and St Austell.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin St Dennis had a population of 2,696 in the 2001 census. The village is famous for its church built on the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The area is full of tips and clay pits of china clay mining but St Dennis village itself is designated an 'island settlement' which prevents encroachment by the china clay industry. Much of the parish is up to 500 feet above sea level, and the countryside is moorland with small fields enclosed by 'Cornish hedges'. The church is on top of a hill overlooking the village and has views to the sea at Newquay. It stands on the site of an Iron Age fort. The tower is the oldest part of the church, and the newer church has been repaired after being destroyed by fire in 1985. The village also has a strong history of Methodism and once had three Methodist chapels, two of these are still in use. ==References== Category:Villages in Cornwall Category:Civil parishes in Cornwall",
