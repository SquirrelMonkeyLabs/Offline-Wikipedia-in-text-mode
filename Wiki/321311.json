 "text": "Teddy Stadium (, Itztadion Teddy) is a football stadium in Jerusalem, Israel. It is the home ground of Beitar Jerusalem F.C. and Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. It is named after the long time Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek. For Beitar the stadium was important. They played at the YMCA Stadium. That stadium was nicknamed \"The Sandbox\" because of its bad ground conditions. Originally only the west and east sides of the stadium were built giving it a capacity of 13,000. In 1999 work was finished on a north side. Now the capacity is 31,733. The stadium itself is one of the newest in Israel and meets all European standards. The stadium has 5,000 parking spots and is connected to the Malha Mall and its parking facilities by a pedestrian bridge. The stadium is located at the Begin Expressway and the Malha Train Station. So people can go to the stadium either by car or rail. Teddy Stadium has hosted international football matches. It was also the place for the Maccabiah Games opening ceremony and other public events. == References == Category:Football stadiums Category:Buildings and structures in Jerusalem",
