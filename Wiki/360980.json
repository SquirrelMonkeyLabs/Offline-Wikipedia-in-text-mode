The company also aired matches in the United Kingdom and Ireland. ==History== The company was started by RF Video owner, Rob Feinstein after Extreme Championship Wrestling went out of business. Feinstein left the company in 2004 after he was caught in an internet sting operation allegedly trying to ask for sex on the internet from a person who he thought was an 13 year old boy but was actually an adult, pretending to be the boy. Gabe Sapolsky left the company on October 26, 2008. Doug Gentry bought Feinstein's stake in the company and sold it to Cary Silkin who then became the president of the company. On the March 2 episode of Dynamite, All Elite Wrestling owner Tony Khan announced that he had bought Ring of Honor from the Sinclair Broadcast Group. ==Code of Honor== Ring of Honor followed a set of rules called the \"code of honor\". The code of honor was considered a moral requirement to follow. They were put in place to make Ring of Honor feel more like Japanese professional wrestling. There were originally 5 rules set in place but they were retired in 2004. They reappeared again and were changed to only 3 rules. ==Champions== As of , === Current champions === ==== Men's division ==== Singles Championship Current champion(s) Reign Date won Days held Location Notes Ref.
