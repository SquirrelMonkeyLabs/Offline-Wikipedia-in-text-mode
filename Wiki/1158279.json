 "text": "Smog towers, or smog-free towers, are big structures that work like air cleaners to reduce pollution in the air. They clean the air by removing small particles like soot and need energy or power to work. == World’s first air cleaning tower == The world's first smog-free tower was made by a Dutch artist named Daan Roosegaarde. It was shown to people in September 2015 in Rotterdam. Later, similar towers were set up or toured in Beijing and Tianjin, China, Kraków, Poland, Anyang, South Korea, and Abu Dhabi. The tower is 7 meters (23 feet) tall and uses special technology called positive ionization. It can clean 30,000 cubic meters of air every hour. == Other towers == === India === By 2022, India had at least eight smog towers, some of them: * Connaught Place (about 80 feet; since August 2021) * Anand Vihar (about 80 feet) * Lajpat Nagar Central Market (20 feet; since January 2020) * Gandhi Nagar Market (12 feet) * Krishna Nagar Market (12 feet) * Bangalore (15 more towers may be added later) * Chandigarh (24–25 meters; uses water to clean air) * Jaipur == Gallery == File:Daan Roosegaarde - Smog Free Tower.JPG|Rotterdam File:Smog free tower in Beijing 01.jpg|Beijing 1 File:Smog free tower in Beijing 04.jpg|Beijing 2 File:Smog free tower in Beijing 07.jpg|Beijing 3 File:Smog free tower in Beijing 09.jpg|Beijing 4 File:Smog free tower in Beijing 13.jpg|Beijing 5 File:Smog free tower in Beijing 15.jpg|Beijing 6 File:Smog free tower in Beijing 14.jpg|Beijing 7 == References == === Citations === Category:Air pollution Category:Solar power",
