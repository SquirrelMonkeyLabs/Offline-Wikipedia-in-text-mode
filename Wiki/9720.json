This area came to be called the Land of Israel. It usually refers to a member of one of the Tribes of Israel. The term Children of Israel is also used, especially when talking about the period of the Five Books of Moses. ==History== Israelites lived in the United Kingdom of Israel, where the modern State of Israel is situated. The kingdom later split into the Kingdom of Israel and Kingdom of Judah, whose descendants have been called Jews ever since. ===Conquests by foreign empires=== The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrians in 721 BCE. Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. Many Jews were taken hostage from Judah. When the Achaemenid Empire defeated the Babylonians they let the Jews return to rebuild the Second Temple in Jerusalem about 70 years later. ==Related pages== * Levant * History of Jews * History of ancient Israel and Judah * History of Jews in the Arabian Peninsula ==References== Category:Judaism Category:Middle East Category:History of Asia * Category:Jewish history Category:Ancient Israel and Judah Category:History of the Middle East",
