 "text": "This is a list of the 222 currently operating suburban railway stations in Melbourne, Australia. The stations make up 16 railway lines going out from the city, as well as the central City Loop. There are also a further 19 stations on 3 old, volunteer-operated, tourist railways. These are not a part of the suburban network. In addition, there are 9 more stations expected to open in the near future. Stations are broken up into 2 Myki ticketing zones (some stations are included in both zones, where tickets for either zone may be used). The fare zones are used to know the price a commuter will pay during their journey. On March 4, 2007, zone 3 was made part of zone 2. *Stations listed in bold are \"terminus\" stations, where trains sometimes stop and change direction. On some lines, some trains will be timetabled not to go to the end of the line. Shuttle trains also run back and forth between terminus stations on some lines. *Stations listed in italics are \"premium stations\" that are manned first to last train by staff who provide extra help and information to commuters. *Stations followed by a star (*) are \"host stations\". These stations are manned during peak hours only, where there are many passengers at the station. Some are manned only during morning peak, some during both morning and evening peaks. *Listed in brackets after each station is that station's 3-letter code. These codes are used by the railway control system. For detailed travel information, do not rely only on this page; please go to the Public Transportation Victoria website. ==City Loop== The City Loop is the centre of Melbourne's train network. Built between 1971-1981, it makes a circle around the Melbourne CBD. Every line, except the entire cross-city group and the Flemington Racecourse line, runs through one of four underground tunnels, which are the loop itself.
