 "text": "The Common Technical Document (CTD) is a set of rules for information to be supplied for the registration of medicines. It was made by the European Medicines Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan) in 1989. It is now used in most of the world. It was adopted in Australia in 2004. It means that medicines can be traded across borders. PipelinePharma has an online marketplace with more than 9 900 European CTD dossiers. ==References== Category:Pharmacy",
