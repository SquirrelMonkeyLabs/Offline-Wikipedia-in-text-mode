 "text": "The Assumption of Mary is one of the four dogmas the Catholic Church has about Mary. Pope Pius XII defined it on 1 November 1950 in his apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus. It says that Mary went straight into heaven. The Assumption of Mary is celebrated in the Catholic calendar on August 15, a holy day of obligation, recognized in some countries as a non- working day. This solemnity is considered the most important Marian celebration of the liturgical year. The Assumption of Mary is included in the Glorious Mysteries of the Saint Rosary.
