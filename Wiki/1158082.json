 "text": "The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hungary is one of the four major historical churches in Hungary. After the Reformed Church of Hungary, it is the second- largest Protestant church in the country. The church's members consist of three nationalities: Hungarian, German, and Slovak. In its congregations, it still uses these minority languages in preaching and liturgy. == History == The establishment of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Hungary dates back to the 16th century Western European Reformation. Initially, Luther's teachings dominated in Hungary, but the views of John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli also became well-known. By the mid-16th century, the followers of the Reformation in Hungary largely adhered to Calvin's teachings. In the 1560s, the supporters of the German and Swiss Reformations eventually split into two separate churches in Hungary: the Reformed and the Evangelical-Lutheran Church.
