 "text": "The Fiat Tempra is a car made by Fiat. It replaced the Fiat Regata in 1990, and was succeeded by the Fiat Marea in 1996. The Tempra was available as 4-door sedan and as 5-door station wagon Weekend. The passenger section and the mechanics of the Tempra were the same as those of the Fiat Tipo hatchback. But the Tipo never had the 4-wheel drive which was available on the Tempra Weekend. This station wagon had a split rear hatch: when opened, most of it went up, but the bottom part with the bumper went down. Some special options on the Tempra were the digital instrumentation and the rear window wiper on the sedan. Apart from Italy, the Tempra was also built in Turkey (until 1998) and Brazil (until 1999). The Brazilian market also had a 2-door coupe version. == Engines == * 1.4 56 kW (76 hp) * 1.4 i.e. 51 kW (69 hp) * 1.6 62 kW (84 hp) * 1.6 i.e. 55 kW (75 hp), 57 kW (78 hp) and 66 kW (90 hp) * 1.8 i.e. 66 kW (90 hp), 76 kW (103 hp) and 80 kW (109 hp) * 2.0 i.e. 83 kW (113 hp) * 1.9 D 48 kW (65 hp) * 1.9 TD 66 kW (90 hp) Tempra Category:Front wheel drive vehicles Category:1990s automobiles",
