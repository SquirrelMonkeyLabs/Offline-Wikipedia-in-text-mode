 "text": "Whyalla is a city on the Eyre Peninsula, on the shore of Spencer Gulf, South Australia. Its main industries are associated with the iron ore mines. Whyalla acted as the port for the export of iron ore. To get the renewal of the mining lease, BHP had to build a blast furnace to smelt the ore into pig iron. This led to the establishment of steel making, and ship building industries, which were very active during the period 19601980. The viability of these industries so far from markets declined. This led to the closure of many operations and a decline in the local population. At its peak, during the mid-1980s, about 35,000 people lived there. ==References== Category:Cities in South Australia",
