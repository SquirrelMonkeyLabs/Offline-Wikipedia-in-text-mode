He won the 2009 elections as the candidate of the left-wing Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN) political party. After his presidency, he lived in exile in Nicaragua from 2016 until his death because he was accused of criminal actions during his presidency. In July 2023, he was placed under sanctions by the U.S. State Department following his conviction in absentia for negotiations related to the gang truces he made while in office, illicit enrichment, and tax evasion. Funes died from problems caused by a heart attack in Managua, Nicaragua, on 21 January 2025, at the age of 65. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:2025 deaths Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction Category:21st-century presidents in North America",
