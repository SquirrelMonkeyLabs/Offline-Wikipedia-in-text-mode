 "text": "Levi was a person in the Book of Genesis who was a son of Jacob and Leah. Along with his brother Simeon he killed the men of Shechem for the rape of Dinah. Because of that, his father Jacob told him that his tribe would not have his land as part of their inheritance but would live on the land of other tribes. ==Children== Levi had three sons and they were named Gershon, Kehath and Merari. ==Moses and Aaron== Kehath had a son named Amaram. Amaram married a woman named Yocheved and became the father of Miriam, Aaron and Moses. Moses became the prophet to the Israelites and Aaron became the High Priest. ==Levites== While the sons of Aaron and their male descendants became the priests, the rest of Levi’s descendant known as the Levites helped the priests in the sanctuary. Their tribe didn’t get any land of their own because they instead had to be the religious ministers to everyone in the other tribes who had to let the Levites live on their land.
