The songs were often sung in Tagalog. It was a mix of rock, folk and ballads. It did not focus on social class. As early as 1973, the Juan De la Cruz Band was performing \"Ang Himig Natin\" (\"Our Music\"), which many people thought was the first example of Pinoy rock. \"Pinoy\" gained popular currency in the late 1970s in the Philippines when Filipinos became more patriotic. Filipino folk singer Heber Bartolome's \"Tayo'y mga Pinoy\" (\"We are Pinoys\") became popular. Filipino rapper Francis Magalona's \"Mga Kababayan Ko\" (\"My Countrymen\") in the 1990s and Filipino rock band Bamboo's \"Noypi\" (\"Pinoy\" in reversed syllables) in the 2000s. Today, the word \"Pinoy\" is used as an adjective for things that have to do with the Philippines or Filipinos. Pinoy rock was soon followed by Pinoy folk and Pinoy jazz. Many songwriters made songs critical of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and his use of martial law and the Batasang Bayan, other songs were subversive and others were about national pride. The Marcos administration ordered radio stations to play a certain number of Pinoy songs each hour. Both Marcos and his enemies used Pinoy music. ==History== ===Beginnings (1960s–1970s)=== P-pop includes Filipino pop songs since the 1960s, especially ballads.
