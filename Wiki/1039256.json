 "text": "The Mengla bush frog, Mengla small tree frog, Mengla shrub frog, or Zhishihe's bubble-nest frog (Raorchestes menglaensis) is a frog. It lives in China, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This frog lives in forest and open areas near streams. People have seen it between 600 and 1100 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not at risk of dying out because even though it does not live in a large place, that place is not still being changed by human beings, and the frog is good at living in changed places. The frog lives near the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
