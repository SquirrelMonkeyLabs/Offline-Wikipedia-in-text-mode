 "text": "Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English guitarist best known as a founder member of the Rolling Stones. == The Rolling Stones == He is mostly famous for his rhythm guitar playing, but he can also play lead guitar quite well. He often likes to use a guitar with only 5 stringsâ€”the lowest-tuned string is removed. On a small number of Rolling Stones recordings, he plays bass guitar, as well as other instruments. He sings background vocals on most Rolling Stones songs. Occasionally, he also sings lead vocals, on songs like \"Happy\", \"Little T & A\", and \"The Worst\". In 2003 he was ranked 10th on Rolling Stone Magazine's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". Richards has co-written and recorded hundreds of songs with his song writing partner Mick Jagger. Fourteen of their songs are listed by Rolling Stone Magazine in their \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" issue. Keith is one of two members of the Rolling Stones to have both; played on all releases and, be in the band during its entire run. The other member to do so is Mick Jagger. Keith is best known for playing a yellow Fender Telecaster. == Jagger/Richards == Jagger/Richards is the songwriting duo of Keith and Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger. Jagger and Richards first met in primary school, but would not see each other until after they both left primary school. The two would meet many years later in 1962 at a train station. They became friends after the meeting and are still friends now. == Personal life == During the late 1960s and most of the 1970s, he had a serious addiction to heroin. However, he recovered and quit using it. Sometimes, in interviews, he talks about taking drugs in a way that seems humorous. ==Discography== ===The Rolling Stones=== ;Studio albums # England's Newest Hit Makers (1964) # 12 X 5 (1964) # The Rolling Stones, Now!
