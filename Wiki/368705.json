This was an increase of 35.9 percent from the 1840 Census. The total population included 3,204,313 slaves. This was the first census where there was an attempt to collect information about every member of every household, including women, children, and slaves. It was also the first census to ask about place of birth. Hinton Rowan Helper made use of the 1850 census results in his politically notorious book The Impending Crisis of the South.
