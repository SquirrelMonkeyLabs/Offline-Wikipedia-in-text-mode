 "text": "Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788-1827) was a French physicist and engineer. In 1808, Fresnel and François Arago discovered that two beams of light polarized in perpendicular directions do not interfere with each other. Then, in 1816, Fresnel proposed a rigorous mathematical explanation of diffraction and interference, successfully explaining them using wave theory replacing the corpuscular theory of light. Independently with Thomas Young, he suggested that light was a transverse wave (which rised to the later aether theory). However, in 1819, Siméon-Denis Poisson, another French physicist, objected to Fresnel's theory of diffraction. The Paris Academy called for experiments to re-examine, proving Fresnel's theory correct. Tjem in 1821, Fresnel proposed a law that allowed scientists to calculate the intensity and polarization of reflected and refracted light. He also developed the Huygens-Fresnel Principle which explains the propagation of light as waves. In addition, Fresnel also invented the Fresnel Lens for lighthouses . Augustin-Jean Fresnel's name is inscribed on the Eiffel Tower, and the asteroid 10111 Fresnel is named after him. He was buried in Père-Lachaise cemetery .
