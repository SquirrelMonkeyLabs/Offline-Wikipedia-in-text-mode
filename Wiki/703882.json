His story is an integral part of the biblical narrative and has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. Abel is the brother of Cain. The Bible says that he was killed by his brother because his brother envied him. Abel took care of animals, mostly sheep and goats. When Cain gave God some of his crops as a sacrifice, God was happy. When Abel killed some of his animals for God, God was happier. Cain was angry, so he killed Abel. == Life of Abel == According to the biblical account, Abel was a shepherd, while his brother Cain was a farmer. Abel offered the \"firstlings of his flock\" as a sacrifice to God, which was pleasing to Him. In contrast, Cain's offering of \"the fruit of the ground\" was not accepted. The biblical text does not provide explicit reasons for God's preference for Abel's offering. == Murder of Abel == Cain's offering being rejected led to feelings of anger and jealousy towards Abel. Cain ultimately killed Abel in a field, as recorded in Genesis 4:8. When God questioned Cain about Abel's whereabouts, Cain denied responsibility for his brother's fate. == Significance of Abel == Abel is considered the first martyr in the biblical tradition. The story of Abel and Cain serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked emotions and the importance of righteousness.
