 "text": "Anti-revisionism is opposition to attempts to modify or reject the fundamentals of communist revolutionary theory and practice. Reformism is seen as a concession to communism's adversaries. Revisionism comes from within the Party, towards whatever is the standard policy of the Party. After Stalin's death, Krushchev's style and policies were thought by Stalinists to be revisionist. The People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha proclaimed themselves to be taking an anti-revisionist line and denounced Khrushchev's policies.
