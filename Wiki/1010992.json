 "text": "The orange-bellied tree frog or orange-belly tree frog (Zhangixalus aurantiventris) is a frog. It lives in Taiwan. This frog lives in forests. It lays eggs in holes in tree trunks and in buckets that people put in forests. Because of this, it only lives in forests that have never been cut down. This frog's home has some protected parks in it: Fu-shan Nature Reserve and Li-chia Wildlife Refuge. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place. They think there are only 2500 of these frogs left in the world. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
