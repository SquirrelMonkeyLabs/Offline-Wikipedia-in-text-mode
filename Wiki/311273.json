O Flower of Scotland, When will we see your like again That fought and died for Your wee bit hill and glen. And stood against him, Proud Edward's army, And sent him homeward To think again. 2\\. The hills are bare now, And autumn leaves lie thick and still O'er land that is lost now, Which those so dearly held That stood against him, Proud Edward's army And sent him homeward To think again. 3\\. Those days are past now And in the past they must remain But we can still rise now And be the nation again! That stood against him Proud Edward's army And sent him homeward To think again. 4\\. O Flower of Scotland, When will we see your like again That fought and died for Your wee bit hill and glen. And stood against him, Proud Edward's army, And sent him homeward To think again. ===Scots=== 1\\. O Flouer o Scotland, Whan will we see Your like again, That focht and dee'd for, Your wee bit Hill an Glen, An stuid agin him, Prood Edward's Airmy, An sent him hamewart, Tae think again. 2\\. The Hills is bare nou, An Autumn leafs Lies thick an still, Ower land that is lost nou, That thae sae dearly held, That stuid agin him, Prood Edward's Airmy, An sent him hamewart, Tae think again. 3\\. Thir days is past nou, An in the past They maun remain, But we can aye rise nou, An be the nation again, That stuid agin him, Prood Edward's Airmy, An sent him hamewart, Tae think again. 4\\. O Flouer o Scotland, Whan will we see Your like again, That focht an dee'd for, Your wee bit Hill an Glen, An stuid agin him, Prood Edward's Airmy, An sent him hamewart, Tae think again. ===Scottish Gaelic=== 1\\. O Fhlùir na h-Alba, cuin a chì sinn an seòrsa laoich a sheas gu bàs 'son am bileag feòir is fraoich, a sheas an aghaidh feachd uailleil Iomhair 's a ruaig e dhachaidh air chaochladh smaoin? 2\\. Na cnuic tha lomnochd 's tha duilleach Foghair mar bhrat air làr, am fearann caillte dan tug na seòid ud gràdh, a sheas an aghaidh feachd uailleil Iomhair 's a ruaig e dhachaigh air chaochladh smaoin. 3\\. Tha 'n eachdraidh dùinte ach air dìochuimhne chan fheum i bhith, is faodaidh sinn èirigh gu bhith nar Rìoghachd a-rìs a sheas an aghaidh feachd uailleil Iomhair 's a ruaig e dhachaidh air chaochladh smaoin. 4\\. O Fhlùir na h-Alba, cuin a chì sinn an seòrsa laoich a sheas gu bàs 'son am bileag feòir is fraoich, a sheas an aghaidh feachd uailleil Iomhair 's a ruaig e dhachaidh air chaochladh smaoin? ==Related pages== * Ireland's Call * La Marseillaise * Waltzing Matilda == References == == Other websites == * Flower of Scotland – The website \"Cantaria\" has a page dedicated to the song, featuring the lyrics and an MP3 file of the song sung by Wild Mountain Thyme. * The Flower of Scotland – The website \"Modern History Sourcebook\" also has a page on the song, featuring midi files.
