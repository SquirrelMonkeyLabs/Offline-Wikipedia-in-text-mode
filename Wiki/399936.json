 "text": "The eighth generation of video game consoles began in 2012. The eighth generation began with the release of Wii U. The PlayStation 4 was announced on February 20, 2013.PS4 release date specs confirmed It was released worldwide on November 15, 2013. Microsoft announced the Xbox One on May 21, 2013. It had its first regional release on November 22, 2013. For handheld game consoles, the generation began in February 2011. The first handheld was the Nintendo 3DS. The PlayStation Vita was released in December 2011 in Japan. It was available for the Western countries in February 2012. It is believed by the video game media that the eighth generation home consoles compete with the smartphone, tablet, and Smart TV gaming markets. Because of this, some analysts incorrectly believed the eight generation would be the last generation of home consoles. Other microconsoles such as the NVIDIA Shield, Steam Box, Ouya and GameStick are attempting to compete in this market. Nintendo officially discontinued the Wii U on January 31, 2017 in anticipation of the March 3, 2017 worldwide release of the Nintendo Switch. The Switch is a \"hybrid\" console that acts as both a home console and handheld device, and it is the beginning of a ninth generation of home consoles. == Systems == ===Comparison=== Name Wii U PlayStation 4 Xbox One Logo Manufacturer Nintendo Sony Microsoft Console Release dates November 18, 2012 November 15, 2013 NA: November 22, 2013 EU: November 22, 2013 (some countries, September 2, 2014, for others) AU: November 22, 2013 BR: November 22, 2013 JP: September 4, 2014 CN: September 29, 2014 Launch prices Basic Model * US$299.99 * £/€, set by individual retailers * A$348.00 * ¥26,250 Deluxe/Premium Model * US$349.99 * £/€, set by individual retailers * A$428.00 * ¥31,500 US$399.99, €399.99, £349.99 US$499/€499/£429/JP¥49,980/CN¥3,699 Units shipped Worldwide: 13.56 million (as of 16 December 2016) Best-selling game Mario Kart 8, 8.26 million units (as of 31 December 2016) Media Wii U Optical Disc @ 22.5MB/s 25 GB (single layer) Blu-ray, DVD Blu-ray, DVD CPU Tri-Core IBM PowerPC \"Espresso\" Octa-Core AMD \"Jaguar\" Octa-Core AMD GPU AMD Radeon \"Latte\" GPGPU @ 550 MHz Custom AMD Radeon, architecture and performance similar to a Radeon 7870 @ 800 MHz Custom AMD Radeon, architecture and performance similar to a Radeon 7790 @ 800 MHz Memory 2 GB DDR3 RAM (1 GB available for games / 1 GB available for system) 8 GB GDDR5 RAM (7 GB available for games / 1 GB available for system) 8 GB DDR3 RAM (5 GB available for games / 3 GB available for system) Storage 8 GB (Basic), 32 GB (Deluxe/Premium) internal flash memory Supports up to 32 GB SDHC memory cards (for Wii mode) Up to 2 TB USB hard disk drive for e-Shop games & save storage HDD with unconfirmed capacity 500 GB HDD Video * 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 576i, 480i; standard 4:3 and 16:9 anamorphic widescreen† * Analog AV port supporting: ** Composite video ** S-Video (NTSC consoles only) ** RGB SCART (PAL consoles only) ** YPBPR *** D-Terminal (Japan only) *** Component video * HDMI † Resolutions other than 576i and 480i available via HDMI and YPBPR only. * 4K, 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 576i, 480i; standard 4:3 and 16:9 anamorphic widescreen† * Analog AV port supporting: ** Composite video ** S-Video (NTSC consoles only) ** RGB SCART (PAL consoles only) *** Component video * HDMI † Resolutions other than 576i and 480i available via HDMI only. * 4K, 1080p, 1080i and 720p * HDMI in / HDMI out Integrated 3DTV support Yes Yes Yes Second screen Off-TV Play Remote Play SmartGlass Audio * Analog stereo via the Analog AV port. * Six-channel PCM linear output via HDMI TBA Peripheral abilities * SD memory card slot (supports SDHC cards) * 4 USB 2.0 ports (2 at front of console, 2 at rear) * Bluetooth * Sensor Bar power port * \"AV Multi Out\" port * HDMI out port * Bluetooth * HDMI out port * USB 3.0 ports (number yet unrevealed) * Bluetooth * HDMI 1 in port and 1 out port * 3 USB 3.0 ports Controller * Wii U GamePad (up to 2) * Wii U Pro Controller (up to 4, but special games are possible up 7) * Wii Remote/Plus (up to 4, but special games are possible up 7) ** Nunchuk attachment ** Classic Controller attachment ** NES Classic Edition game-pad (Virtual Console compatible) * Wii Balance Board * GameCube Controller via Adapter for Wii U (up to 8, two sets of four) * DualShock 4 * PlayStation Move * PlayStation Vita * Wireless controller * Kinect * Voice command Online services {| class=\"wikitable collapsible innercollapse\" Nintendo Network Accounts * Nintendo Network ID (up to 12 per system) * User Account Profile (up to 12 per system) * Personal Mii (one linked per account) * Friend List (up to 100 friends) * Origin support (EA-published titles only) * Uplay support (Ubisoft-published titles only) Social network : Miiverse Games * Online multiplayer (upwards of 8-12 players) * Online leaderboards * Accomplishments System * Voice/video chat (requires at least one Wii U GamePad) Cloud storage :TBD Communication * Wii U Chat (video calls/voice chat) * Friend List (up to 100 friends) ** Block List ** Player History (online players met) * Notifications * SpotPass * Cross Platform with Nintendo 3DS Online Shop : Nintendo eShop Entertainment * Nintendo TVii (discontinued August 11, 2015) * YNN!
