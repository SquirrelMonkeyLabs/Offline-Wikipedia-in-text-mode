The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into arrondissements, which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture. If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture. The arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes. The arrondissements of the Saône-et-Loire department are: INSEE code Arrondissement Capital Population (2014) Area (km²) Density (Inh./km²) Communes 711 Autun Autun 86,693 1,900.3 83 712 Chalon-sur-Saône Chalon-sur-Saône 200,084 1,726.0 149 713 Charolles Charolles 99,381 2,500.3 135 714 Louhans Louhans 55,567 1,248.5 79 715 Mâcon Mâcon 114,063 1,199.6 121 ==History== Since its creation, the Saône-et-Loire department has had few changes: * 1790 : seven districts: Autun, Bourbon-Lancy, Chalon-sur-Saône, Charolles, Louhans, Mâcon and Semur-en-Brionnais; Mâcon was the capital.
