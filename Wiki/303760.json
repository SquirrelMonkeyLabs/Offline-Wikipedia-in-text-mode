A vaccine, which prevents children from getting the disease is available in many countries. Like most viruses, rotaviruses are made from RNA and protein. The RNA carries the genes that are used to make more rotaviruses. They are called rotaviruses because they sometimes look like little wheels and \"rota\" is the latin word for \"wheel\".

This comes in a small packet that is added to drinking water. It contains salt and sugar, which helps the body take up the water. Rotaviruses were discovered in the 1970s. Since then doctors and scientists have shown that they are a problem to children all over the world. More than 500,000 children die from rotavirus infection each yearWorld Health Organization.
