 "text": "Johann Joseph Most (5 February 1846 in Augsburg â€“ 17 March 1906 in Cincinnati) was a German-American anarchist and orator. He is best known for accepting the strategy of \"propaganda of the deed,\" which promoted direct action against a single person or institution (including the use of violence) to force revolutionary change and inspire further action by others. He travelled in Europe, and he lived in countries such as France and United Kingdom. In 1906, in Ohio, he fell sick because of a chronic case of erysipelas, a bacterial skin infection, in an era without any antibiotic treatments. Most died in a few days. ==Related pages== * List of anarchists == References == *Memoiren (New York, 1903). == Other websites == *Johann Most Page Anarchist Encyclopedia Category:1846 births Category:1906 deaths Category:American anarchists Category:American political writers Category:Writers from Saxony Category:People from Augsburg Category:Politicians from Saxony Category:Politicians of the Social Democratic Party of Germany Category:Marxists",
