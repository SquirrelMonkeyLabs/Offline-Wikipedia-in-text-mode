 "text": "The Cambodian–Vietnamese War was a war fought between Kampuchea (present-day Cambodia) and Vietnam. The war had started because of repeated attacks by the Khmer Rouge guerillas into Vietnamese territory, which often caused the massacre of entire villages. On 21 December 1978, after the Khmer Rouge had raided a village on the border, perpetrating the Ba Chúc massacre, murdering almost all 3,000 Vietnamese civilians, Vietnam decided to launch a full-scale invasion of Kampuchea, which the aim of overthrowing the Khmer Rouge forces of Pol Pot. Less than 2 weeks later, the Vietnamese army entered Phnom Penh, establishing a new government made up of Khmer Rouge defectors. In response to the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, China invaded Vietnam. As a response to the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam managed to stop the Cambodian genocide, which caused the deaths of between 1.5 million and 3 million people, approximately 25 percent of the country's population. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2022 Category:Wars involving Asia Category:20th century in Cambodia Category:20th century in Vietnam",
