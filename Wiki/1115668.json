 "text": "The 8th European Athletics Championships were in Budapest, Hungary. The championship happened from 30 August to 4 September 1966. They were held in the Nép Stadium. The IAAF made a new rule that required female athletes to prove their gender. This was the first championship where this was required. All women competitors had to have a sex check. Many of the greatest women athletes from Europe missed these championships. High jumper Iolanda Balaș, shot putter Tamara Press, and long jumper Tatyana Shchelkanova all missed the championships. ==Medal summary== ===Men=== 10.5 10.5 10.5 20.9 21.0 21.0 46.0 46.2 46.3 1:45.9 1:46.0 1:46.3 3:41.9 3:42.2 3:42.4 13:42.8 13:44.0 13:47.8 28:26.0 28:27.0 28:32.2 13.7 = 14.0 14.0 49.8 50.3 50.5 8:26.6 8:28.0 8:28.0 Marc Berger Jocelyn Delecour Claude Piquemal Roger Bambuck 39.4 Edvin Ozolin Armin Tuyakov Boris Savchuk Nikolay Ivanov 39.8 Hans-Jürgen Felsen Gert Metz Dieter Enderlein Manfred Knickenberg 39.8 Jan Werner Edmund Borowski Stanisław Grędziński Andrzej Badeński 3:04.5 Friedrich Roderfeld Jens Ulbricht Rolf Krusmann Manfred Kinder 3:04.8 Joachim Both Günter Klann Michael Zerbes Wilfried Weiland 3:05.7 2:20:04.6 2:21:43.6 2:22:02.0 1:29:25.0 1:30:06.0 1:30:18.0 4:18:42.0 4:20:01.2 4:20:47.2 2.12 m 2.12 m 2.09 m 5.10 m 5.05 m 5.00 m 7.98 m 7.88 m 7.88 m 16.67 m 16.66 m 16.59 m 19.43 m 18.82 m 18.68 m 57.42 m 57.34 m 56.80 m 84.48 m 81.76 m 80.54 m 70.02 m 68.62 m 67.28 m 7740 pts 7614 pts 7562 pts ===Women=== 11.5 11.5 11.8 23.1 23.4 23.7 52.9 53.9 54.0 2:02.8 = 2:03.1 2:03.7 10.7 10.7 10.7 Elzbieta Bednarek Danuta Straszynska Irena Kirszenstein Ewa Kłobukowska 44.4 Renate Meyer Hannelore Trabert Karin Frisch Jutta Stöck 44.5 Vera Popkova Valentyna Bolshova Lyudmila Samotyosova Renāte Lāce 44.6 1.75 m 1.73 m 1.71 m 6.55 m 6.45 m 6.38 m 17.22 m 17.05 m 16.96 m 57.76 m 57.38 m 56.80 m 58.74 m 56.94 m 56.70 m 4787 pts 4765 pts 4713 pts *The women's 100 metres gold medal winner Ewa Kłobukowska got the same time as the championship record twice.
