 "text": "The Avenida de las Matemáticas is a public avenue located in Seville, Spain. ==Background== In December 2019, a group of young people from the Montaigne College in Seville promoted, together with their mathematics teacher, José Carlos Gámez, a campaign on Change.org to collect signatures and create a mathematics avenue in Seville. They created a website (callematematicassevilla.wordpress.com). In 2020, they had the support of the Seville Institute of Mathematics and the University of Seville. On March 14, 2022, International Mathematics Day, the mayor of Seville, Antonio Muñoz, received the promoters of the campaign and approved the proposal. That same year it was presented at the XX Jornadas para el Aprendizaje y Enseñanza de las Matemáticas. ==Inauguration== On January 10, 2023, the Avenue was presented with the mayor of Seville, the education minister of the Junta de Andalucía, and various members of the Seville mathematical community. ===Criticism=== Just after the Mathematics Avenue was inaugurated, Carlos Navarro Antolín, opinion journalist from the Diario de Sevilla, suggested that now a Latin and Greek street will be released, criticizing that the mayor is more concerned with mathematics. Some people also complained that the opening ceremony of the Avenue was too exclusive, or that the street chosen was not the most suitable. == References == Category:Seville Category:2020s in Spain",
