 "text": "The Geo Prizm was a small car sold by Chevrolet from 1990 to 1997. Replacing the Chevrolet Nova, it was based on a Toyota Corolla Sprinter with the Geo name on it. The Prizm was produced alongside the Corolla and the Tacoma pickup truck at New United Motor Manufacturing in Fremont, California which was jointly owned by General Motors and Toyota from 1985-2010. From 1989-1992 it was sold as a subcompact sedan and hatchback, but in 1992 it was redesigned and sold solely as a compact sedan (this was due to Toyota Corolla and Sprinter being redesigned). The Prizm and the Corolla shared the same parts and engines. It is the only Geo model not sold in Canada under Pontiac. In 1998, the name of the car was changed to Chevrolet Prizm. Due to the discontinued Toyota Sprinter and a loss in sales General Motors replaced the Prizm with the Pontiac Vibe and the Chevrolet Cobalt. == References == category:sedans category:1990s automobiles category:2000s automobiles category:Chevrolet automobiles",
