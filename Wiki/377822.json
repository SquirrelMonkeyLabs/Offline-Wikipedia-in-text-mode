The words of Yano's citation explain: > Sfc. Yano distinguished himself while serving with the Air Cavalry Troop. > Sfc. Yano was performing the duties of crew chief aboard the troop's > command-and-control helicopter during action against enemy forces entrenched > in dense jungle. From an exposed position in the face of intense small arms > and antiaircraft fire he delivered suppressive fire upon the enemy forces > and marked their positions with smoke and white phosphorus grenades, thus > enabling his troop commander to direct accurate and effective artillery fire > against the hostile emplacements. A grenade, exploding prematurely, covered > him with burning phosphorus, and left him severely wounded. Flaming > fragments within the helicopter caused supplies and ammunition to detonate. > Dense white smoke filled the aircraft, obscuring the pilot's vision and > causing him to lose control. Although having the use of only 1 arm and being > partially blinded by the initial explosion, Sfc. Yano completely disregarded > his welfare and began hurling blazing ammunition from the helicopter. In so > doing he inflicted additional wounds upon himself, yet he persisted until > the danger was past. Sfc. Yano's indomitable courage and profound concern > for his comrades averted loss of life and additional injury to the rest of > the crew. By his conspicuous gallantry at the cost of his life, in the > highest traditions of the military service, Sfc.
