 "text": "The Centrist Democrat International (CDI; Spanish: Internacional Demócrata de Centro; French: Internationale démocrate centriste, IDC) is the international alliance of moderate conservative and Christian-democratic political parties. Until 2001, it was known as the Christian Democratic International and, before that, as the Christian Democratic and People's Parties International (until 1999). It was founded in 1961 in Santiago, Chile, as the Christian Democratic World Union, based on the legacy of other Christian-democratic internationals that attempted to create a Christian-inspired Third Way alternative to the socialist and communist internationals; In 1982, it changed its name for the first time to Christian Democratic International, but later was renamed again due to the growing participation of parties of other religions. Although it brings together parties from all over the world, its members are mainly from Europe and Latin America. It shares some members with the International Democracy Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political center and more communitarian than the IDU. == References == Category:Political movements Category:Christian democracy Category:Conservatism",
