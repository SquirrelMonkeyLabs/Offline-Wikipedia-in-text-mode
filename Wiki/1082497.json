Its contract, worth $37million is for 40 projects. They include the refurbishment of the Illichivets Stadium, the rebuilding of two university campuses and the reconstruction of dozens of residential buildings in the Left Bank. 90% of the residential buildings in the city were damaged or destroyed in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The majority owner, Nikolay Milkis, is a former deputy governor of a Siberian province. Milkis worked for pharmaceutical giant R-Pharm when R-Stroy was founded. R-Pharm was founded by Alexey Repik, known in Russia as one of the “kings of winning government contracts,” according to Forbes. Repik was placed under sanctions in the UK in February 2023 for his “close working relationship with Putin”. Ivan Sibirev in March 2023, acquired 40% of R-Stroy. The other shareholders are Konstantin Nuriev, who founded the company and retains 5%, and Valeriy Zolotukhin, who bought 5% in March 2023. Zolotukhin is also the general director of hospital construction company Petrusco, which is owned by Daeva, Repik’s mother. ==References== Category:Companies of Russia Category:Construction Category:Crimea Category:Engineering companies",
