 "text": "A multivalued function (multifunction) is a relation like a function. A multifunction associates each input with at least one output. A strict function associates each input with exactly one output. An example of a multivalued function is the square root. Every complex number (except for 0), has two square roots. Example: \\sqrt{4} could be 2 or -2 because 2^2 = 4 and (-2)^2 = 4. == References == Category:Functions and mappings",
