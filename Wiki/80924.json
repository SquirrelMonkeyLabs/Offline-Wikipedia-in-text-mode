Sheppard in 2000,IAUC 7555: Satellites of Jupiter 2001 January 5 (discovery)MPEC 2001-A29: S/2000 J 7, S/2000 J 8, S/2000 J 9, S/2000 J 10, S/2000 J 11 2001 January 15 (discovery and ephemeris) and given the designation . Praxidike orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,824,000 km in 613.904 days, at an inclination of 144° to the ecliptic (143° to Jupiter's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.1840. It was named in August 2003 after Praxidike,IAUC 7998: Satellites of Jupiter 2002 October 22 (naming the moon) the Greek goddess of punishment. Praxidike belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break- up of a captured asteroid.Sheppard, S. S., Jewitt, D.
