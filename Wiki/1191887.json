 "text": "Ángel Jorge Pititto, known by the pseudonym Ángel Mahler (23 May 1960 – 25 May 2025) was an Argentine composer and conductor. He stood out as a composer for theatrical musicals. Mahler served as Minister of Culture of the city of Buenos Aires between July 2016 and December 2017. ==Biography== His birth name was Ángel Jorge Pititto, but in 1996 he legally requested to change his surname to the pseudonym he had chosen: Mahler. However, the court ruled against him, considering the change to be beyond the scope of the law and suggesting, in the ruling itself, either changing the spelling of the surname or removing some of its letters. His work, Dracula the Musical, represents an icon in the history of Argentine musicals. Since its premiere in 1991 at Luna Park Stadium, it has sold more than three million tickets and won the most prestigious awards for best music: ACE, Estrella de Mar, Prensario, and others. Dracula has run for six seasons at Luna Park in Buenos Aires; three seasons at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires; one in Villa Carlos Paz (1999) and one in Mar del Plata (1993). Dracula also toured nationally (1991-1992, 1998-1999, 2003, and 2007), as well as internationally: Chile (1992, 2007); Barcelona (Spain, 1995); Brazil (2000); and Uruguay (2007). Over the years, the Cibrián-Mahler duo became the most prolific musical-creating duo in Argentina, becoming a classic on the Buenos Aires billboard. ==References== == Other websites == * Official website of Ángel Mahler.
