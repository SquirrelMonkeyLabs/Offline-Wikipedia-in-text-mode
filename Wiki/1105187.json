He starts a relationship with Leona, a white woman from the South. He shows her his life and he gets her to meet the people he knows, such as his best friend. This friend is Vivaldo, a novelist who finds life difficult. Leona also meets Scott's mentor, Richard, who is more successful. She also meets Richard's wife, Cass. At the start, the relationship is not very serious. Later, it becomes more serious as they continue to live together. Rufus often becomes physically abusive of Leona. Leona has to go to a mental hospital in the South. Rufus becomes depressed. He goes back to Harlem and commits suicide, by jumping off the George Washington Bridge. The rest of the book is about relationships between Rufus' friends, family, and other people he knows, after his death.Leeming, James Baldwin (1994), p. 201: \"Rufus has been deeply wounded by the realities of racism. He is an embodiment of the curse that lurks in the American soul. Baldwin describes Rufus as 'the Black corpse floating in the national psyche'; he and what he represents must be squarely faced if we are to find peace in ourselves and our society. In Nobody Knows My Name, Baldwin had written, 'The nation, the entire nation, has spent a hundred years avoiding the question of the place of the Black man in it.' Rufus is that man, touched in one way or another by him, by his agony. Rufus is the Christ figure — the sacrificial victim — in this parable of Baldwin's 'gospel.'\"Ryan, Katy. 2004. \"Falling in Public: Larsen's 'Passing', McCarthy's 'The Group', and Baldwin's 'Another Country'.\" Studies in the Novel 36(1):95–119. . .Dunning, Stefanie. 2001. \"Parallel perversions: Interracial and same sexuality in James Baldwin's Another Country.\" Melus 26(4):95–112. .
