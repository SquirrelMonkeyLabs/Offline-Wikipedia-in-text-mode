 "text": "Mario Party 5 is a party board video game for the Nintendo GameCube console. It is the fifth game in the Mario Party series. It was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. It was released on November 10, 2003 in North America, on November 28, 2003 in Japan, and on December 5, 2003 in Europe. ==Gameplay== Mario Party 5 plays the same as the first four Mario Party games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player that wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Boards have different types of spaces, including blue spaces which add coins, red spaces which take away coins, and Bowser Spaces which causes Bowser to appear and do a bad event. The game introduces the DK Space, where Donkey Kong appears to cause an event to happen. Unlike Bowser events, these events are always good. Also new to the game is the Capsule system, which replaces the item system from past games. Capsules are containers that hold a single item. Players can get capsules by passing by the \"Capsule Machine\" on the board. Each capsule does something different, including increasing the number of dice blocks a player can roll, and taking away coins from an opponent. Capsules can be thrown up to ten spaces away. Ten characters are playable. New to the series as a playable character are Toad, Boo, and Koopa Kid. Because of the addition of the DK Space, Donkey Kong is no longer a playable character. In addition to the main party game, players can also play a mode called Super Duel Mode. In Super Duel Mode, players build a battle vehicle to use in tournaments or fight against friends. Players are able to change their vehicle by using different parts. Parts can be bought with the points from mini-games. ==References== Category:2003 video games Category:Nintendo GameCube games Category:Mario Party games Category:Nintendo GameCube-only games Category:Party video games Category:Video games about dreams Category:Video games about pirates",
