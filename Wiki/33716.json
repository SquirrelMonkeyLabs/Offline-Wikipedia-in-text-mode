 "text": "Zinedine Zidane (born 23 June 1972, nicknamed Zizou, Yaz and ZZ) is a French former football player. He played for four European clubs and the French national team. He played for Real Madrid from 1997 to 2002. His name is a predecessor to Zedan. ==Early life== Zidane was born in Marseille, France and is of Kabyle Berber descent. ==Career== Zidane played for several famous football clubs, like Juventus of Italy and Real Madrid of Spain. He led France to win the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2000 European Football Championship. In 2002 he also won the UEFA Champions League for Real Madrid, which was the ninth championship for Real Madrid. Zidane was picked as the FIFA World Player of the Year three times. He led France to the 2006 World Cup final and was arguably the best player in the tournament. He is widely regarded to be one of the greatest players of his generation and of all time. ===Retirement === In 2006, Zidane announced that he would retire after the World Cup. Zidane was famous for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest during the 2006 FIFA World Cup final at the 110th minute of extra time and was sent off with a red card. France eventually lost 5-3 in penalties to Italy and got second place. This incident was widely known as the Zidane headbutt. There is even a sculpture of it in Doha, Qatar. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competitionZidane, Zinedine Yazid Zidane , BDFutbol Club Season League Cup Europe Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Cannes 1988–89 Division 1 2 0 0 0 — — 2 0 1989–90 Division 1 0 0 0 0 — — 0 0 1990–91 Division 1 28 1 3 0 — — 31 1 1991–92 Division 1 31 5 3 0 4 0 — 38 5 Totals 61 6 6 0 4 0 0 0 71 6 Bordeaux 1992–93 Division 1 35 10 4 1 — — 39 11 1993–94 Division 1 34 6 3 0 6 2 — 43 8 1994–95 Division 1 37 6 5 1 4 1 — 46 8 1995–96 Division 1 33 6 3 0 15 6 — 51 12 Totals 139 28 15 2 25 9 0 0 179 39 Juventus 1996–97 Serie A 29 5 2 0 10 2 3 0 44 7 1997–98 Serie A 32 7 5 1 11 3 1 0 49 11 1998–99 Serie A 25 2 5 0 10 0 1 0 41 2 1999–2000 Serie A 32 4 3 1 6 0 — 41 5 2000–01 Serie A 33 6 2 0 4 0 — 39 6 Totals 151 24 17 2 41 5 5 0 214 31 Real Madrid 2001–02 La Liga 31 7 9 2 9 3 2 0 51 12 2002–03 La Liga 33 9 1 0 14 3 2 0 50 12 2003–04 La Liga 33 6 7 1 10 3 2 0 52 10 2004–05 La Liga 29 6 1 0 10 0 — 40 6 2005–06 La Liga 29 9 5 0 4 0 — 38 9 Total 155 37 23 3 47 9 6 0 230 49 Career total 506 95 61 7 117 23 11 0 695 125 ===International=== Appearances and goals by year and competition Team Year Competitive Friendly Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals France 1994 1Appearance in the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying 0 1 2 2 2 1995 5Appearances in the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying 2 1 0 6 2 1996 5Appearances at UEFA Euro 1996 0 7 1 12 1 1997 — 8 1 8 1 1998 8Five appearances and two goals in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, three appearances in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying 2 7 3 15 5 1999 3Appearances in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying 1 3 0 6 1 2000 5Appearances at UEFA Euro 2000 2 8 2 13 4 2001 — 8 2 8 2 2002 4One appearance in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, three appearances in the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying 0 5 1 9 1 2003 4Appearances in the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying 3 3 0 7 3 2004 4Appearances at UEFA Euro 2004 3 3 1 7 4 2005 4Appearances in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification 1 1 1 5 2 2006 6Appearances in the 2006 FIFA World Cup 3 4 0 10 3 Total 49 17 59 14 108 31 :Scores and results list France's goal tally first.
