 "text": "Moldovan (, Moldovan Cyrillic: лимба молдовеняскэ) is a term to refer to the Romanian language. It was one of the official languages of Moldova when it was part of the Soviet Union. It was written in the Cyrillic alphabet until 1989. In 1989, Moldova became its own country and started to use the Latin alphabet, which is used in Romania. On 5 December 2013, the Moldovan government chose Romanian as the official language. In the unrecognized state of Transnistria, one of the official languages is still Moldovan and is still written with the Cyrillic alphabet. The other official languages are Russian and Ukrainian.
