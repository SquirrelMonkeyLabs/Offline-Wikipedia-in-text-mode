While celebrating his children's first birthday in Far Far Away, Shrek storms out in anger. He is invited inside Rumpelstiltskin's carriage. Rumpelstiltskin offers him a deal to live a day as a \"real ogre\" in exchange for a day from his childhood. Shrek signs a contract to get this wish, and is sent to another reality. Now feared by the villagers in this new version of reality, Shrek has fun until he discovers that his swamp is deserted and his home is not there Captured by witches, Shrek is taken to Rumpelstiltskin , who is now the King. Rumpelstiltskin reveals to Shrek that he took the day he was born, meaning Shrek never existed in this timeline. This also means that Fiona was never rescued from her imprisonment. Shrek escapes Rumpelstiltskin's castle with Donkey. Donkey helps Shrek find a hidden exit clause; the contract can be destroyed by \"true love's kiss\". The pair soon encounter a Fiona leading an army of ogres in a resistance against Rumpelstiltskin and the witches. Shrek unsuccessfully tries to kiss Fiona, who has since lost hope of finding true love after not being rescued, and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpelstiltskin. During the ambush, most of the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, who was hired by Rumpelstiltskin, but Shrek and Fiona escape with Puss in Boots and Donkey. Later on, Rumpel publicly offers a wish to anyone who brings him Shrek, and after hearing this, Shrek turns himself in. Rumpelstiltskin is forced to grant Shrek's wish, and he uses it to free the other ogres. As Shrek is locked up, Rumpel reveals that Fiona had been captured and not released, since she is not \"all ogre\" (she turns into human during the day, as her curse was not stopped because she was never rescued). Donkey, Puss, and the freed ogres attack the castle and fight the witches. As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses him just before he disappears. Seeing that she is still an ogre in the sunlight, Fiona realizes that her curse was broken and that the true love's kiss worked. This also means that the contract has been destroyed. The alternate reality falls apart and everybody in it dies. Shrek finds himself transported back to the original timeline at the moment before he left the party. Shrek embraces his family and friends with a newfound appreciation for them. ==References== Category:2010 movies Category:2010 comedy-drama movies Category:2010 3D movies Category:2010 animated movies Category:2010s sequel movies Category:American comedy-drama movies Category:American 3D animated movies Category:DreamWorks Animation movies Category:Shrek Category:Movies about animals Category:Movies set in castles Category:Movies composed by Harry Gregson-Williams Category:Movies directed by Mike Mitchell",
