 "text": "A spark plug also known as a \"sparking plug\", is a device used in delivering the electric current to the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber in an internal combustion engine.

This causes electricity to jump the gap, making a spark which ignites fuel. Category:Automotive technologies",
