 "text": "Macramé is a form of textile art. It is created using knotting (rather than weaving or knitting) techniques. The main knots of macramé are the square (or reef knot) and forms of \"hitching\" with many combinations of half hitches. It was long created by sailors. They often created ornamental knotting forms to cover anything from knife handles to bottles or parts of ships. Cavandoli macramé is one type of macrame. It is used to form geometric and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Leather or fabric belts are items that are often created by macramé techniques. Most friendship bracelets made by children and teens are created using macrame. Category:Textile arts",
