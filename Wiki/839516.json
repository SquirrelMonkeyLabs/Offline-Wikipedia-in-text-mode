 "text": "On 3 May 2021 at 22:25 CDT, an elevated section on Line 12 of the Mexico City Metro collapsed between the Olivos and Tezonco stations in Mexico City, Mexico. At least 25 people were killed when the bridge and train fell onto the road below. Opened in 2012, Line 12 is the newest line. Since then, the line did not seem very stable, which led to a closure during 2014 and 2015 in the raised parts, where the crash happened. The bridge was damaged by the 2017 Puebla earthquake and it was fixed in a few months. A couple of years later, local people said that there were still problems. ==References== Category:2021 disasters in North America Category:2020s in Mexico Category:Disasters in Mexico Category:May 2021 events Metro overpass collapse Category:Railway accidents in North America",
