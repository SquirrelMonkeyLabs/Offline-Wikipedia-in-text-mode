 "text": "The 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup final was a football match held on 17 July 2011, at Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, to decide the winner of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. Japan played against the United States and won 3-1 in a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in extra time. This made Japan the first team from Asia and outside Europe and South America to win a senior World Cup, either men's or women's. Japan's win was surprising and significant, as the country was recovering from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that killed over 15,000 people. This final was also the last major sports event broadcast in Japan before the country switched to digital TV on 24 July 2011. == Match == {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" GK 21 Ayumi Kaihori RB 2 Yukari Kinga CB 3 Azusa Iwashimizu CB 4 Saki Kumagai LB 15 Aya Sameshima RM 11 Shinobu Ohno CM 6 Mizuho Sakaguchi CM 10 Homare Sawa (c) LM 8 Aya Miyama CF 7 Kozue Ando CF 9 Nahomi Kawasumi Substitutions: FW 18 Karina Maruyama FW 17 Yūki Nagasato FW 20 Mana Iwabuchi Manager: Norio Sasaki Player of the Match: Ayumi Kaihori (Japan) Assistant referees: Marina Wozniak (Germany) Katrin Rafalski (Germany) Fourth official: Jenny Palmqvist (Sweden) === Statistics === Statistic Japan United States Goals scored 2 2 Total shots 14 27 Shots on target 6 5 Ball possession 52% 48% Corner kicks 4 8 Fouls committed 11 10 Offsides 2 3 Yellow cards 1 0 Red cards 1 0 == References == Category:2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Category:FIFA Women's World Cup finals",
