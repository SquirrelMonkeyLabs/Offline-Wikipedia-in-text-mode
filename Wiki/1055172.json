After the Thai Nation Party was dissolved on December 2, 2008, due to electoral fraud charges, she was banned from participating in Thai politics for five years, along with other party executives. After the ban was lifted, she returned to politics by running as the second party-list representative under the Chartthaipattana Party. On October 26, 2018, the Chartthaipattana Party elected Kanchana as its new leader, succeeding Theera Wongsamut.
