 "text": "The conquest of East Anatolia in 1833 was a major military campaign led by Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz, the ruler of the Soran Emirate, as part of his ambitious expansion during the Rawandiz Revolt. The campaign began with an unexpected assault on the Bohtan Emirate, ruled by the powerful Kurdish leader Bedir Khan Beg. == Battle == Following a series of swift victories, Muhammad Pasha forced Bedir Khan to retreat and ultimately cede control of the Bohtan region to the forces of Soran. This marked a significant shift in Kurdish regional power, as the strategically important territories of Bohtan fell under Rawanduz authority. With Bohtan subdued, Muhammad Pasha advanced further into East Anatolia, encountering resistance from local Ottoman garrisons. The most notable clash occurred at the Battle of Mardin, where the forces of the Soran Emirate confronted a larger Ottoman army led by Reşid Mehmed Pasha. Despite the odds, the Soran army achieved a tactical victory, consolidating Muhammad Pasha’s hold over Upper Mesopotamia and parts of eastern Anatolia. == References ==",
