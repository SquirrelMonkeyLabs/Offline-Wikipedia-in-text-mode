 "text": "The Yonaguni monument is a group of very big underwater rocks. It is off the southern coast of Japan. It was discovered by local divers in the 1980s. The monument has staircase-like terraces with flat sides and sharp corners. Most of academic society believe the rock formation is created by nature. Masaaki Kimura, a professor of earthquakes in the University of the Ryukyus, and some newspaper people believe it is a man-made structure engraved or built 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. The main feature (the \"Monument\" proper) is a rectangular formation measuring about 150 by 40 m (490 by 130 ft), and about 27 m (90 ft) tall. The top is about 5 m (16 ft) below sea level. Most of its top surface is a complex series of terraces and large wide steps, mostly rectangular, with walls that are almost vertical. Some of its peculiar details include: *Two closely spaced pillars which rise to within eight feet of the surface *The \"Loop Road\", a 5 m (16 ft) wide ledge that surrounds the base of the formation on three sides *The \"Totem\", a stone column about 7 m (23 ft) tall *The \"Dividing Wall\", a straight wall 10 m (33 ft) long *The \"Gosintai\", an isolated boulder resting on a low platform *The \"Turtle\", a low star-shaped platform *The \"Triangle Pool\", a triangular depression with two large holes at its edge *The \"Stage\", an L-shaped rock ==Other websites== Category:Okinawa Prefecture Category:Monuments and memorials",
