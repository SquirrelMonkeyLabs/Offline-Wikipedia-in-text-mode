Biographies can also be made as movies (often called biopics) or told as stories. The oldest written biographies that historians have were written to record rulers' lives. Some were written in Assyria, ancient Babylonia, ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. Biographies were an early form of history. Another early form of biography was called hagiography, meaning writing about holy people. In ancient China, a biography was one of the basic forms of a history book.
