 "text": "The Lichuan tree frog (Zhangixalus wui) is a frog. It lives in China. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Hanchi Village in Hubei Province. ==Appearance== The adult male frog is about 35.2â€“38.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 48.6 mm long. This frog can be dark yellow-brown to light green in color on the back and sides. It has light brown spots that are dark yellow-brown on the edges. Frogs that live in grass tend to be greener than those that live in mud. The belly is cream-white with gray marks. The sides of the legs can be light red-white with gray marks. The insides of the back legs are white with brown spots. There are round disks on the toes for climbing. ==Home== People have seen male frogs sitting on plants near ponds. The female frog lays eggs in the water, on moss, or on other plants. Scientists think the eggs hatch into tadpoles, like with other frogs in Chirixalus. People have seen this frog between 1550 and 2000 meters above sea level. ==Danger== Scientists think this frog is at some risk of dying out because it only lives in one place and they do not think it lives anywhere else. Human beings cut down the forests where it lives to build roads. Chemicals meant to grow crops and chemicals meant to kill farm pests can also kill this frog, but as of 2021, there are not many of these chemicals near where the frog lives. ==Name== Scientists named this frog after amphibian scientist Guan-fu Wu. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
