 "text": "Rose Hall was founded as a free village during the time of slavery. It is located in the North Leeward side of St. Vincent. It is the highest village above sea level in St. Vincent. Some aspects of Rose Hall are: It was an egalitarian village with groups of close-knit families: The Williams's, Samuel's, Stapleton's, Ferdinand's, Lampkin's, Garraway's, Robertson's, Cain's, Burke's, Mason's, Franklyn's, Brown's, Richard,s and few others. Rose Hall does not have it's own beach; however, it is in walking distance to the beaches in neighboring villages such as Troumaca, Rose Bank, and Petit Bordel. Rose Hall is very chilly at nights and the mountain breeze is dry, crisp, clean, except when there is a volcanic eruption at La Soufriere, which is miles away from the village, but can be seen clearly as it were a mile or so away. The people of Rose Hall rely heavily of farming, and this village once was considered as one of the primary bread-baskets of St. Vincent. Our Rose Hallian fore-parents were very hardworking, God-fearing Christians, and respect for elders was held at the strictest standards. Also, giving, sharing, and accommodating strangers were some of its best quality. Education, moral values, good manners, and behavior were seen as the keys that will take it people throughout the world. Category:Geography of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines",
