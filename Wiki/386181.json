Image of Nyan Cat ==Origin== ===Animated GIF=== On April 2, 1992, a person named Christopher Torres put the moving picture, without the song, on his place in the internet. The place is called LOL-comics, and the picture is still there. Torres was making pictures, and two different people wanted him to make a cat and a piece of food. He combined the two to make a picture, and then made it a moving picture a few days later. ===The Song=== The song was made using The Vocaloid Oliver from Vocaloid in Japan and put onto the internet. ===YouTube video=== A YouTube user called \"saraj00n\" put the moving picture together with the song and put it onto the internet on April 5, 2011. saraj00n called it \"Nyan Cat\". Torres wanted the cat to be called \"Pop Tart Cat\", but because of saraj00n now it's called \"Nyan Cat\". ==Popularity== The original moving picture that saraj00n put onto the internet was seen 90,000,000 times . It's very well known, so other people made their own Nyan Cats. People made songs for their phones, pictures for computers, and progress bars. There are also things for iPhones, Android phones, Windows Phones, and HP webOS. There is also a game about Nyan Cat called \"Nyan Cat Adventure\". Nyan Cat was in ninth place in a contest for best moving picture on the internet in 2011 by Business Insider. ==References== ==Other websites== * The first Nyan Cat moving picture on YouTube by saraj00n, April 5, 2011. * Nyan Cat's place on the internet Category:Internet memes Category:YouTube",
