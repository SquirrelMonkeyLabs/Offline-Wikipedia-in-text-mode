He was the first Bishop of Bielsko-Żywiec from 1992 to 2013. == Early life == Tadeusz Rakoczy was born on 30 March 1938 in Gilowice, Poland. He became a priest on 23 June 1963. == Career == In 1992, Pope John Paul II made him the first Bishop of Bielsko-Żywiec. He served in this position until 2013. After retiring, he lived in Bielsko-Biała. == Controversies == In 2019, the Vatican received a report about Bishop Rakoczy. The report said he did not handle cases of sexual abuse by priests in his diocese properly. It said he did not act after being told about a boy who was abused by a priest. The investigation was led by the Archbishop of Kraków, Marek Jędraszewski. It looked into two cases of abuse. In May 2021, the Vatican punished Bishop Rakoczy. He was banned from public celebrations and meetings, told to live a life of prayer and penance (repentance of sins), and ordered to donate money to the Saint Joseph Foundation. == References == == Other websites == * Diocese of Bielsko- Żywiec Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Polish Roman Catholic bishops Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals",
