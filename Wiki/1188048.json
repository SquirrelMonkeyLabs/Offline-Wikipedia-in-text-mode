Adult frogs' bellies are white in color but young frogs' bellies are darker in color. ==Home== This frog lives in forests. People also found it on pine tree farms. Scientists have seen the frog between 50 and 700 meters above sea level. This frog lives in two protected places, Los Ruiles and Los Queules National Reserves, but they are both small. ==Young== The eggs are yellow in color and about 2.33 mm across. The tadpoles swim in pools in streams. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. People change the places where the frog lives to grow pine trees and build towns.
