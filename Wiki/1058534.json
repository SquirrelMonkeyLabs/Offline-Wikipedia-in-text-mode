 "text": "Especially in the United States, the term spree killer is used for someone who commit several murders, usually in a short period of time. Very often, the killings are done in different locations. There is disagreement about what 'short time' means: The US Bureau of Justice Statistics speaks about almost no time break between murders. Some academics say that there may be weeks or months between the murders. As an example, Andrew Cunanan killed five people over a period of three months. He is considered to be a spree killer.
