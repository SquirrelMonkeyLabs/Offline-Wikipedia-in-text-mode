 "text": "The Popemobile is the glass-enclosed and armored vehicle used by the Pope of the Catholic Church when moving through the crowds. Currently, it is a modified Mercedes-Benz with a small glass-enclosed rear compartment where the pope sits. However, in the countries he visits, a locally adapted popemobile is usually provided. After the assassination attempt on John Paul II's life in 1981, its windows were bulletproof. However, it has occasionally been driven with the windows down. It is the successor to the old Sedia gestatoria (portable throne). ==History== The first precedent for the popemobile dates back to the short pontificate of John Paul I, who decided not to use the gestational chair, as had been used by his predecessors. The first popemobile was a white, open vehicle decorated with the coats of arms of the Dominican Republic and the Holy See and equipped with an awning; it was used by John Paul II in Santo Domingo, from January 25 to 26, 1979, on a stopover during his trip to Mexico. He later used a white Ford D-Series, created in Ireland for the pope's use during his first visit to that country in 1979. ==License== The license plate used by the Popemobile contains the designation SCV1, which stands for Stato della Citt√† del Vaticano (Vatican City State), because the Pope holds the status of head of state. For Pope Francis' visit to Peru in 2018, the Peruvian government created, through Ministerial Resolution No. 018-2018 MTC/01.02, the \"pontifical license plate,\" with a special design while maintaining the official designation. However, only the SCV1 designation was used on the vehicles used by the Pope in Peru. ==References== == Other websites == * Popemobile by Thibault Fire Engine Category:Vatican City",
