But being without a publisher means that they have no-one telling them what they can and can't do, giving them much more freedom to make a game they want to make. But making a Indie game does not mean they have no publisher. Indie game developers often go to crowd-funding sites to help fund the game, but often make very little profit. == History == Indie games started on PCs where it currently remains. Indie games become popular as shareware.
