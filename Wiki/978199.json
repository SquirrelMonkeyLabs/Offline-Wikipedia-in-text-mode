 "text": "\"Saba, You Rise from the Ocean\" is the anthem of Saba. ==Lyrics== English original Dutch translation I Saba, you rise from the ocean, With Mountain and hillside so steep, How can we reach you to greet you, Isle of the sea, rough and deep. Come, let us look at the rowers with faces so placid and calm, Guide us now safe through the breakers, take us ashore without harm. Saba, Oh Jewel most precious, In the Caribbean sea. Mem'ries will stay of thy beauty, Though we may roam far from thee. II Saba, oh pearl of the ocean, Friendly and lovely, though small, Do not forget to be grateful, To God the creator of all. He in his goodness will guide you and bless you in every part, Making you always most precious Saba, so dear to my heart. ==References== Category:Dutch anthems Category:North American anthems Category:Saba",
