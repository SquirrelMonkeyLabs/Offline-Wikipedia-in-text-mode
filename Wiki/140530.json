It is referred to by various other names around the world, such as \"Jizzy Jiscuit\", \"Wet Biscuit\", and \"Ookie Cookie\". Although the way it is spelled may differ slightly, the notability of the game is shown by the variations of it being referred to in popular culture, examples including Stephen Fry's The Liar, the German movie Crazy, the 2006 film Sleeping Dogs Lie, the \"Chains\" episode of Blackadder II, the \"Freaks & Greeks\" episode of Drawn Together (2004-2006), the \"Sleepover\" episode of Big Mouth, Limp Bizkit, and Skinless's song \"Scum Cookie\". The game is sometimes considered a form of hazing or bullying, where the participants are pressured to engage in an act of humiliation and degradation. Despite its cultural ubiquity, there is little documented evidence of the game actually being played, with most accounts describing it as an urban legend or rumor. The idea of the game persists, however, likely due to its shock value. == References == Category:Games Category:Sexual acts",
