 "text": "The Bideford witch trials began in 1682. Three women from Bideford, England were accused of witchcraft and hanged. The women were named Temperance Lloyd, Susanna Edwards and Mary Trembles. They were the last women in England to be executed for this crime. At that time, Bideford was an important part of a growing transatlantic trade route with Newfoundland and Virginia. Due to plague and smallpox epidemics, by 1680 the crowded town had a population of 2,600. Religion and folklore played key parts in the beliefs of 17th-century people. At the time, there was a reviving interest in and fear of witchcraft. Category:1682 Category:1680s in Europe Category:17th century in England Category:Trials",
