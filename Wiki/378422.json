It is one of the richest and fastest growing areas of South Korea. The provincial capital is called Hongseong. == History == In ancient times, South Chungcheong Province belonged to Mahan - the ancient tribal country of Korea. After Baekje conquered Mahan, it belonged to Baekje. Later, in the Goryeo Dynasty, it was grouped with current Gyeonggi-do and North Chungcheong into 'Gwangyang-do'. In the Joseon Dynasty, South Chungcheong and North Chungcheong were reorganized into Chungcheong-do. On October 4, 1896, it was separated as South Chungcheong. ==References== ==Other websites== *http://www.chungnam.go.kr/englishMain.do Category:Provinces of South Korea",
