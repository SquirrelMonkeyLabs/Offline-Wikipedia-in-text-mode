 "text": "The River Trent is one of the major rivers of England. It is the third longest river in the United Kingdom. It starts in Staffordshire. It flows through the centre of England until it joins the River Ouse to form the River Humber (estuary) which empties into the North Sea. The name \"Trent\" comes from a Celtic word possibly meaning \"strongly flooding\". More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Celtic words, tros (\"over\") and hynt (\"way\"). It is unusual amongst English rivers in that it flows north (for the second half of its route), and is also unusual in exhibiting a tidal bore, the \"Aegir\". The area drained by the river includes most of the northern Midlands. ==Navigation== The river is legally navigable for some below Burton upon Trent. However, for practical purposes, navigation above the southern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal (at Shardlow) is conducted on the canal, rather than on the river itself. ==Trent Aegir== At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a tidal bore which can be up to high. ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * Photographs along the Trent in Nottingham from Nottingham21 Category:Geography of Staffordshire Category:Rivers of Derbyshire Category:Rivers of Nottinghamshire Category:Geography of Leicestershire Category:Rivers of Lincolnshire",
