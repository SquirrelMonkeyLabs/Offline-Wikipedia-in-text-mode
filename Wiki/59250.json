 "text": "Polyethylene (also called polyethene, usually shortened to PE) is a thermoplastic. It is used in consumer goods, typical examples are transport wraps, and garbage bags. Other uses include pre-fabricated plastic parts, plastic tubes, and insulation of electric cables. Polyethylene plastic wrap is usually less adhesive than Polyvinyl chloride, but this can be remedied by adding linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), which also increases the film's tensile strength. The world makes over 80 million tonnes of polyethylene per year. == Products == * Amphibian Fencing * Bespoke Polythene Bags Made To Order * Clinical Waste Bags * Coloured Polythene Bags * Food Waste Polythene Bags * Low Melt EVA Bags * Printed Polythene Bags * Scented Polythene Bags, Sacks & Sheeting == References == ==References== Category:Thermoplastics",
