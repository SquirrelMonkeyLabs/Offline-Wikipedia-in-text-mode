 "text": "Town privileges were important things. They were special treaties or royal charters used in the Middle Ages. In such a charter, a sovereign, a monarch granted the town or city special rights. These usually included *The right to have a market, to form guilds *Some freedoms, like to determine the government of the town or city, or to judge criminals. *Some people who permanently lived in the town or city (called Burghers) had special rights. Getting these rights was a special privilege (and not granted to everyone). Many of those charters were very similar. In the end, only few charters remained in use. Notable ones in the territory of modern-day Germany include the LÃ¼beck law, the Magdeburg rights and the Kulm law. Category:Middle Ages",
