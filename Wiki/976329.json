 "text": "X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology, or XROMM, is a scientific research technique. Scientists use XROMM to make 3D movies of animals' bones while they are still alive. In XROMM, a surgeon puts radio-opaque bone markers inside the animal's body. Then an X-ray video system can tell exactly where the markers are. This helps the scientists make very good videos of how the bones move. Scientists at Brown University invented XROMM in 2010. XROMM can be used to show birds in flight, humans running, frogs jumping, and a toad swallowing crickets. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Technology Category:Physics",
