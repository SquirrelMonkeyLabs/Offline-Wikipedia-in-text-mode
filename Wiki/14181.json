Kopp said the reason he shot the doctor was that he was against the abortions that the doctor did. ==Murder of Slepian== On October 23, 1998, Slepian, his wife, and their four children came home from synagogue (Jewish church). Kopp waited outside the home with a rifle. He shot Slepian in the back through a window while Slepian was in the kitchen. Slepian's wife and son Andrew were standing in the same room with him. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American prisoners Category:American Roman Catholics Category:American terrorists Category:Criminals from California Category:People from Pasadena, California Category:Abortion-rights activists",
