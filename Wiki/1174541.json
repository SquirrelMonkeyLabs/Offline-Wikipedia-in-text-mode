 "text": "The first actual cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. state of Louisiana were announced on March 9, 2020. Beginning from the first confirmed case, the outbreak grew into other states and counties. As of Thursday, September 29, 2022 there were 1,454,828 cumulative COVID-19 cases and 18,058 deaths in the State. Confirmed and noted cases appeared in all 64 Louisiana parishes. The New Orleans area saw most of the cases and COVID-19 related deaths. The Governor John Bel Edwards closed schools statewide starting on March 16, 2020, limited most businesses to takeout and delivery only, and placed many restrictions on large gatherings. The fast spreading of COVID-19 might have begun in late February 2020. The virus was introduced to the state under domestic travel. It was already present before Mardi Gras although the festival likely accelerated the spread of the condition. Multiple clusters of COVID took place within nursing homes and assisted living places. In New Orleans, one such outbreak at the Lambeth House infected 50â€“60 people. Thirteen deaths happened in connection with this outbreak.
