 "text": "The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, also known as the Iranian–American confrontation and the Crisis in the Gulf, is an increase of military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America in the Persian Gulf region. The U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to push away a possible planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), creation of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. In response, Iran designated the United States Central Command as a terrorist organization. == Related pages== *List of ongoing armed conflicts ==References== Category:2019 in Asia Category:2010s in Iran Category:2020 in Iran Category:2021 in Iran",
