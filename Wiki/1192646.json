 "text": "The Nickel-Strunz classification system is a way of organizing minerals into groups based on their chemical properties. It is the system used by the International Mineralogical Association. The Strunz classification expands the earlier Dana classification system. The system is named after Karl Hugo Strunz, who created the first version in his 1941 book Mineralogical Tables. The 9th edition, published 2009, was the first version available in English, and was cowritten by Strunz and Ernest Henry Nickel. == Classes == The Strunz classification groups minerals into ten classes: # Native element minerals, containing pure elements, natural metal alloys, and some compounds that have similar chemistry # Sulfide minerals # Halide minerals # Oxide minerals, which also includes hydroxides and other # Carbonate and nitrate minerals # Borate minerals # Sulfate minerals # Phosphate minerals # Silicate minerals # Organic compounds that are found as minerals Category:Minerals",
