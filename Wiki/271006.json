 "text": "White people are people with light skin. Most white people are of European origin. In American English, the term \"Caucasian\" is used to mean \"white people.\" Outside of North American, it refers to people or things from the Caucasus Mountains. Before the modern age, Europeans did not think of themselves as \"white\". They defined their race, ancestry or ethnicity in terms of their nationality: Greek, Roman, etc. The idea of a single white race came into use starting in the 17th century. The term white was invented during American slavery to distinguish European Americans from African American slaves. The people who were the strongest supporters of the white race being supreme in 20th century Europe were fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. They felt that some European peoples such as Slavs as a different race even though they were white. This was just for political purposes. ==Related pages== *Race (sociology) *Racism *Historical race concepts *Black people *White Americans *White Anglo-Saxon Protestant *White nationalism *White supremacy *White genocide myth *White Mexicans *White Hispanic and Latino Americans *Caucasian race == References == Category:Historical races",
