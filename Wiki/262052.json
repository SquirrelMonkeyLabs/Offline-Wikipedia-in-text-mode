 "text": "Hydrobromic acid is an acid. Its chemical formula is HBr. It is a very strong acid. It is used to make bromides by reaction with metals or metal oxides. It can be made by reacting bromine, sulfur dioxide, and water. This reaction makes hydrobromic acid and sulfuric acid. It is made by dissolving hydrogen bromide in water. It can also be made by reacting bromine with sulfur and phosphorus. It can also be made by electrolysis of a bromide solution. It can be made by reacting bromides with non-oxidizing acids, because oxidizing acids would turn the bromides into bromine. ==Related pages== *Hydrochloric acid *Hydriodic acid *Hydrofluoric acid Category:Binary acids Category:Bromine compounds pl:Bromowod√≥r#Kwas bromowodorowy",
