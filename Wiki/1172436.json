 "text": "The Air Battle of Valjevo was fought on 4 May 1999, between 2 USAF F-16CJs escorting a NATO formation and 1 MiG-29 flown by Milenko Pavlović, commander of the Yugoslav Air Force 204th Fighter Regiment. It resulted in his death, but he made the NATO aircraft stop the bombing of Valjevo and they withdrew. == Background == In the spring of 1999, the city of Valjevo in Serbia became a major target of NATO airstrikes. Over 32 attacks devastated the city, particularly the Krušik military factory, which was hit by 215 missiles. The city and surrounding areas were further impacted by an earthquake on April 30, intensifying the suffering of its citizens. On May 2, 1999, NATO bombarded Valjevo with 51 missiles, primarily targeting the Krušik factory and nearby residential areas. == Air fighting == On 4 May 1999, a lone Yugoslav MiG-29 flown by Pavlović attempted to intercept a large NATO formation that was bombing Valjevo, it was where Milenko Pavlović grew up. Originally, a younger pilot was intended to scramble the MiG-29 before Pavlović himself pulled the younger pilot out of the cockpit before he would take off, allegedly telling the younger pilot that he 'was not going to die', but that Pavlović himself would. MiG-29 took off, Pavlović was outnumbered and faced 16 aircraft of USAF F-16CJs from the 78th Fighter Squadron. Piloting a MiG-29, he engaged in an unequal battle to defend the skies over Valjevo and the Krušik factory. He was facing superior technology. Pavlović engaged in the air battle against 16 NATO aircraft, he managed to confuse them and even make them flee with his bold approach, but soon, at around 12:45, he was hit by three missiles fired by Dutch pilots from an F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft, positioned west of Tuzla. he was shot down with an AIM-120, \"I have them, but they have me,\" were his last words, captured on the radio. He died while still in the air. The remains of his aircraft fell in the village of Petnica. He was buried on May 6, 1999, at the Bežanija cemetery. == References == NATO bombing Category:Conflicts in 1999 Category:Military operations of the Kosovo War Category:Battles involving FR Yugoslavia Category:Air-to-air combat operations and battles",
