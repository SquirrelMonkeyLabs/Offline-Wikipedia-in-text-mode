 "text": "Inca rope bridges were simple suspension bridges over canyons and gorges to provide access for the Inca Empire. Bridges of this type were suitable for use since the Inca people did not use wheeled transport - traffic was limited to pedestrians and livestock. These bridges were an important part on the Inca road system and are an excellent example of Inca innovation in engineering. They were frequently used by runners delivering messages throughout the Incan empire. == Other websites == *The Last Inca Suspension Bridge: A Photo Album (various images of amazing Inca Bridges and pathways, old and new.) *Boston University, Inca Bridge to the past This bridge was also in use of crossing when they were at war. ==References== * Incas: Lords of Gold and Glory, 1992, Virginia: Time-Life Books. *Finch, Ric, 2002, Keshwa Chaca: Straw Bridge of the Incas: Ithaca, N.Y., South American Explorer, n. 69, fall/winter 2002, p. 6-13.
