 "text": "Raorchestes theuerkaufi is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: 1392 meters above sea level on a Kadalar tea farm in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen this frog sitting on rocks and on dead leaves on the ground in forests that have been cut down and are growing again. These forests were near tea farms and cardamom farms. People also saw this frog sitting on plants next to roads. People have seen this frog between 1393 and 2000 meters above sea level. Like other frogs in Raorchestes, this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in only a small place. Scientists think that chemicals meant to kill pests could hurt this frog. Scientists think climate change could hurt this frog too. Scientists think the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can also make this frog sick. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. One of the places this frog lives is a protected park: Anamalai Tiger Reserve. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
