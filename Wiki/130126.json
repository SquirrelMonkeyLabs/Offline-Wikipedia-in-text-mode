The stadium is named after the sportswear and fitness company DWSportsfitness. It opened in 1999 as JJB Stadium, from the JJB Sports sportswear company. The name changed in 2009 when Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan bought a chain of fitness clubs from JJB Sports and set up a new business, DWSportsfitness. The deal also gave Whelan stadium naming rights, and he changed its name to DW Stadium at that time.
