 "text": "A sexual system is how male and female roles are shared among organisms in a species. It's sometimes called a reproductive or mating system. The boundaries of the different systems are not quite clear because of changes in traits. The sexual systems have been studied for a very long period. == Types of sexual systems == Sexual systems of flowering plants may be either monomorphic or dimorphic. In monomorphic systems, one plant can have different types of flowersâ€”some that are male, female, or both (hermaphrodite). Examples are like-monoecy, gynomonoecy, andromonoecy, and trimonoecy. In dimorphic systems, the plant forms only one flower type, male, female, or hermaphrodite. Like - dioecy, gynodioecy, androdioecy, trioecy. Staminate flowers are male and consist only of stamens. They produce pollen. The female flowers are pistillate, containing only pistils. The flowers of hermaphrodite have both male and female parts: stamen and pistil. In animals, similar systems exist where hermaphrodites live alongside single-sex individuals, and these are called mixed sexual systems. == List of sexual systems == Sexual system Androdioecy Dichogamy Dioicy Dioecy Gonochorism Gynodioecy Gynomonoecy Gynodioecy-Gynomonoecy Monoicy Monoecy Sequential hermaphroditism Sequential monoecy Simultaneous hermaphroditism Synoecy Trioecy Trimonoecy == References == Category:Developmental biology Category:Evolutionary biology",
