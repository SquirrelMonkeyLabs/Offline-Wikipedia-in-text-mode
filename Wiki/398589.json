 "text": "Henrieta Farkašová (born 21 February 1988) is a skier from Australia. She has a disability: she cannot see everything. She skied at the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships. She was the second skier to finish the women's visually impaired downhill race, and the third skier to finish in the Super-G race and the Super Combined race. Because she cannot see, Andrew Bor was her guide and told her where to go when going down the mountain. ==References== Category:Australian skiers Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from New South Wales Category:Sportspeople with disabilities, type B2 Category:Competitors at the 2018 Winter Paralympics Category:Australian sportspeople with disabilities",
