This was in response to Houthi attacks on international trade ships bound for Israel since November 19, 2023, as well as attacks on American and British navy ships. The Houthis claimed these attacks were due to the Israeli war on Gaza. The UK Cabinet met, and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak approved the strikes. ==Attacks== At around 2:30am in Yemen (11:30pm UTC), American planes with smart bombs attacked from nearby bases and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier. Ships and a submarine launched cruise missiles. The BBC said British jets from Cyprus also joined. The U.S. Air Forces Central said they used over 100 bombs to hit 60 targets in 16 places. The U.K. Defence Ministry announced that it had targeted two sites. The first site, located at Bani in northwestern Yemen, was used to launch reconnaissance and attack drones. The second site was the Abbs airfield, which, according to the MoD, had been used for launching both cruise missiles and drones over the Red Sea. Explosions were reported in Sanaa, Hodeidah and Dhamar. The targets included logistics centres, air defense systems and weapons storage sites. According to a Houthi-run news channel, Hodeida International Airport, Taiz International Airport, the al-Dailami Air Base north of Sanaa, an airport near Hajjah and a camp east of Saada were hit. ==Images== == Related pages == * List of military operations during 2024 * 2024 attack on the Khalissa, a failed retaliation attack on 12 January * 17 January 2024 missile strikes against Houthi * 13 January 2024 al-Dailami Air Base missile strike, a related missile strike * 6 January 2024 attack on the USS Laboon * 9 January 2024 Houthi attacks ==References== Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Battles involving the United Kingdom Category:Houthi Movement Category:January 2024 events Category:2024 in Asia Category:2020s in Yemen Category:Conflicts in 2024 Category:Red Sea crisis",
