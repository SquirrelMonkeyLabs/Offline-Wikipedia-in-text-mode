Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory (\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"). This claimed that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarises its species' evolutionary development.Di Gregorio, Mario A. 2005.
