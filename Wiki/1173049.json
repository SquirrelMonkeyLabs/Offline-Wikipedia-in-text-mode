 "text": "In academic sense, historical revisionism refers to the re-interpretation of historical records. ==Overview== Typically, historical revisionism presents itself as the rejection of mainstream descriptions of certain events. * * * Such rejection may involve showing perceived counter-evidence and/or questioning the motives of those involved. Historical reviews are needed from time to time to ensure historical accuracy. However, historical revisionism sometimes has a negative meaning as many forms of historical revisionism are not motivated by good faith. ===Pseudohistory=== Some engage in historical revisionism to deny genocides (e.g. the Holocaust, Bosnian genocide) and spread hatred towards some ethnic groups, * * * * * which can have a dangerous impact on society. Such revisionist history is seen as a form of conspiracy theory, sometimes called pseudohistory. ===Revisionists=== Those promoting pseudohistory are called historical revisionists, or simply revisionists. Some call them distortionists as well. Examples of historical revisionism are laid out as follows. ==Holocaust denial== Holocaust denial is the denial of the Holocaust Distortion of the Holocaust refers, inter alia, to: * * * * * * ‒ a genocide led by Nazi Germany that killed at least 6,000,000 Jews (67% of pre-war European Jews) in Axis-occupied territories between 1933 and 1945. * * * * * * * * * * * ===Recent trend=== A trend of Holocaust denial, some state-sponsored, is also seen in other European countries, including Austria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, * * * Germany, Italy and Poland. * Robert Rozett, “Competitive Victimhood and Holocaust Distortion,” The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, XVI (2022); “Distorting the Holocaust and Whitewashing History: Toward a Typology,” XIII: 1 (2019); Yehuda Bauer, “Creating a “Usable” Past: On Holocaust Denial and Distortion,” XIV: 2 (2022); and Jan Grabowski, “The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'” X: 3 (2016). * Joanna Beata Michlic, “The Politics of the Memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland: Reflections on the Current Misuses of the History of Rescue,” Jewish Historical Studies—Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England, LIII: 1 (2022); Piotr Forecki, Po Jedwabnem: Anatomia pamięci funkcjonalnej (Kraków, 2018); Jan Gross, Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne (Princeton, 2001). * Piotr Forecki, “Domestic ‘Assassins of Memory’: Various Faces of Holocaust Revisionism in Contemporary Poland,” presentation at a symposium in honor of Professor Antony Polonsky called “The Holocaust in Eastern Europe: sources, memory, politics,” March 16, 2021, UCL, London. * * Antony Polonsky and Joanna Beata Michlic (eds.), The Neighbors Respond: The Controversy over the Jedwabne Massacre in Poland (Princeton, 2009) and Laurence Weinbaum, “Amnesia and Antisemitism in the ‘Second Jagiellonian Age,’” Anti-Judaism, Antisemitism, and Delegitimizing Israel, Robert Wistrich (ed.)

From Empathy to Denial. Arab Responses to the Holocaust. New York: Columbia University Press. # Blaming Jews for the Holocaust # Equating the Holocaust with other crimes against humanity, which is common in academia. Some scholars said that Holocaust denial had gone mainstream * * * amid the rise of nationalism across Europe, where Jews were sometimes equated with the disliked Soviet communists against whom the Holocaust was considered \"a reaction\". Some described the phenomenon with the concept mnemonic politics, where nationalist governments distorted the Holocaust by framing their ethnic majority as the victims rather than the Jews or Roma.Kónczal, Kornelia, and Moses, A.

CrossRef Google Scholar ===Denialist claims=== Type Claims Common * They say the Nazis \"did not use death camps or gas chambers to kill Jews\". * Holocaust deniers say the Nazi regime was \"only trying to deport Jews, not to kill all of them\". They say there was \"no official Nazi policy to kill Jews\", and that \"no Nazi leader ever gave an order to kill all of the Jews\".Mathis, Andrew E. Holocaust Denial, a Definition, The Holocaust History Project, July 2, 2004, Retrieved 6 March 2013 * History experts agree that the Nazis killed at least 6,000,000 Jews during the Holocaust.Mathis, Andrew E. Holocaust Denial, a definition , The Holocaust History Project, July 2, 2004, Retrieved 6 March 2013 Holocaust deniers say that far fewer Jews actually died. They also claim that many of these victims died of diseases, like typhus, instead of being murdered by the Nazis.Michael Shermer & Alex Grobman. Denying History: : who says the Holocaust never happened and why do they say it?, University of California Press, 2000, , p. 106 Other * They say that evidence about the Holocaust is fake. * They say there are errors and differences in stories told by Holocaust survivors and so the stories cannot be believed. * They say the allies treated enemy prisoners of war just as badly as the Nazis treated the Jews. * They say that after being taken prisoner, many Nazis gave confessions about having committed war crimes. Holocaust deniers say these people said things that were not true because they were tortured. * They say that during World War II, \"the Allies made up fake stories about the Holocaust to make Germans look evil\". Then, Jews, working together, \"spread these fake stories as part of a bigger plan to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine\". Now, Jews continue to spread these stories to get sympathy and to get support for the state of Israel. ===Denialist tactics=== ====Just Asking Questions==== Just Asking Questions (JAQ) is a pseudoskepticalFaking as being neutral about a topic to hide one's bias. * * * tactic used by Holocaust deniers to promote lies about the Holocaust by phrasing them as questions. * * * * * Holocaust deniers tend to claim that they are \"only asking questions\" about the Holocaust while rejecting any evidence that proves that the Holocaust happened. Writing for the Slate magazine, Johannes Breit, a German historian, stated that JAQ used to be seen frequently in posts made by Holocaust deniers in Reddit's r/AskHistorian subreddit (2.2M subscribers), which caused its moderators to ban them from participation in 2018, while Reddit has been long been criticized for uncontrolled antisemitism. * * * * * American historian Deborah Lipstadt (1947 – ) commented on JAQ's potential impact: ====Sealioning==== Sealioning is a similar concept to JAQ. Sealioning refers to the repeating the same questions that have already been answered while faking ignorance and politeness. It is also common on online forums and social media, * * * where antisemitism, especially Holocaust denial, is widespread. * * * * * ===Examples=== ====Communist Romania==== ====Institute for Historical Review==== The Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a self-declared academic group, has been promoting Holocaust denial since 1978. * * * In several of its papers, the IHR compared the Holocaust to Allied bombings of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, making the false analogy popular among antisemites worldwide. While claiming to be neutral, the IHR promotes the lie that \"the Holocaust was invented by Jews to \"further Jewish-Zionist interests\". The IHR also claims that \"Nazi Germany actively supported Zionism\" by presenting relevant history without context. Some of the IHR's views are shared by figures across the political spectrum, including former London mayor Ken Livingstone (1945 – ), who was a British Labour Party member until 2018, PA's leader, * * * * * * and American Trotskyist activist writer Lenni Brenner (1937 – ). * * * * * * * * * * ====Richard C. Lukas==== Richard C. Lukas (1937 – ) is an American scholar, seen by some historians as a \"Holocaust revisionist\". In his 1986 book The Forgotten Holocaust, Lukas claimed that a \"separate Holocaust against ethnic Poles\" had happened under Nazi occupation. Lukas also tried to expand the definition of the Holocaust to include every other group targeted by the Nazi Germans, arguing that \"Jewish historians\" were \"controlling Holocaust history\". David Engel, a Holocaust historian, wrote a 30-page article in the journal Slavic Review to criticize his claims, pointing out that Lukas invented facts, ignored archival sources and failed to assess secondary sources. ====Pierre Guillaume==== Pierre Guillaume (1940–2023), a French ultra-left anarcho-Marxist activist, published books denying the Holocaust, calling it a \"distraction from class struggle\" that \"played into the hands of Zionism and Stalinism\". * * * Guillaume argued that the Holocaust was \"no different\" from any other racially motivated massacres in history, going as far as calling the Holocaust \"a distraction from class struggle\" that \"played into the hands of Zionism and Stalinism\". Despite being left-wing, Guillaume's views were adopted by the French far right, many of whom also believed that the Holocaust was \"no different\" from the alleged Judean massacres of the Canaanites or the Native American genocide, dismissing the Holocaust as an \"excuse for extorting compensations from European countries\". ====David Duke==== David Duke (1950 – ), leader (1974 – 1980) of the White supremacist group Ku Klux Klan (KKK), is widely seen as a Holocaust denier. On December 11 – 13, 2006, Duke attended a Holocaust-denying conference in Iran upon invitation from Iran's regime. In expressing his rejection of the Holocaust's uniqueness, Duke accused \"Zionists [of] weaponizing the Holocaust to deny the rights of the Palestinians\". He went on to argue that \"[T]he Holocaust [...] is the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder.\" He was one of the 70 participants of the conference. ====Croatian Wikipedia==== Between 2009 and 2021, Croatian Wikipedia was controlled by a group of far-right administrators who promoted Holocaust denial by censoring * * * * the war crimes of the pro-Nazi Ustaše-ruled Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and blocking dozens of rule-abiding users for trying to remove the false content. Željko Jovanović, the Minister of Science of Croatia back then, also advised against the use of the Croatian Wikipedia. The most serious violation by the far-right administrators was their anti-historical designation of the Jasenovac concentration camp, in which 77,000–99,000 were killed, * * * * * as a \"collection camp\". Their Holocaust denial was condemned by scholars, officials, advocacy groups and media critics. Following a year-long investigation (2020–21) by the Wikimedia Foundation, several complicit users and administrators were either banned or demoted, with one of the administrators found to have consolidated his or her power with 80 sockpuppet accounts. ====English Wikipedia==== English Wikipedia was criticized for condoning the systematic whitewashing of Nazi war criminals on the platform. * * * * * For instance, Arthur Nebe, a senior SS official who invented mobile gas chambers to kill Jews, was portrayed as a savior of Jews based on distortion of a cited source that actually said the opposite, while false claims of Nazi war criminals \"opposing\" Hitler were made. SS units responsible for the Holocaust were either depicted as brave fighters or described in passive voice to make their atrocities look normal. Those who corrected the false content had also faced persistent harassment from pro-Nazi users, some of whom were found to have repeatedly cited materials from Holocaust-denying sources (e.g. Journal of Historical Review, Nation Europa and Franz Kurowski) and gamed the rules to prevent the removal of those content. The violations continued for years with limited administrative intervention, which mainstreamed Nazi sympathy among young readers and hurt efforts to preserve the Holocaust's historical truth. German military historian Jens Westemeier commented on the issue, In 2023, Holocaust historians Prof. Jan Grabowski and Dr. Shira Klein published a 57-page article titled Wikipedia’s Intentional Distortion of the History of the Holocaust in The Journal of Holocaust Research in which they said to have found widespread distortion of Poland's Holocaust history on English Wikipedia, * * * * which involved the exaggeration of Jewish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, invention of Jewish \"war crimes\" against Poles, downplaying of Polish collaboration with Nazi/Soviet occupiers, and blaming Jews for their own suffering: [[File:Bialystok-following-1939-So.jpg|thumb|A photo that (in this version) is featured as figure 1 in the paper, with the caption \"Photograph of a sign in Białystok, wrongly captioned as a Jewish welcoming banner for the Soviets\" (referring to this edit)]] American scholar Richard C. Lukas defended the Wikipedia users involved, repeating his false claim that \"Jewish historians\" were \"controlling Holocaust history\". Prof. Grabowski and Dr. Klein also criticized English Wikipedia's administrators and the Wikimedia Foundation's lack of will to handle, leaving the site vulnerable to disinformation: On another occasion, Prof. Grabowski said, Other cases of distortion reported by Grabowski and Klein are summarized as follows: Type Summary Death toll Myth 1: \"3 million non-Jewish Poles were killed in WWII.\"Wikipedia article, “Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust,” Wikipedia, revision from 8:06, May 24, 2022, Fact: The number was claimed in 1946 by Jakub Berman, the head of the Polish communist secret police, to create a false equivalence between Jewish and Polish victimhood.Karyn Ball and Per Anders Rudling, “The Underbelly of Canadian Multiculturalism: Holocaust Obfuscation and Envy in the Debate about the Canadian Museum for Human Rights,” Holocaust Studies, vol. 20, no. 3 (2014): pp. 33–80.

Scale of helping Jews Myth 2: \"Thousands of Poles were executed for helping Jews.\" Fact: 800 Poles were executed for helping Jews according to the most recent estimates.Ryszard Walczak et al. (eds.), Those Who Helped: Polish Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust (Warszawa: IPN, 1997).Martyna Grądzka-Rejak and Aleksandra Namysło, (eds.), Represje za pomoc Żydom na okupowanych ziemiach polskich w czasie II wojny światowej, vol. 1 (Warsaw: IPN, 2019), p. 464. Scale of hiding Jews Myth 3: \"450,000 Poles hid Jews in their houses during the Holocaust.\"Richard C. Lukas, Out of the Inferno: Poles Remember the Holocaust (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1989), p. 15. Fact: The number was promoted by Władysław Żarski-Zajdler, a writer propagandizing for the Polish communist regime during the 1968 antisemitic campaign. Fewer than 30,000 Polish Jews survived the Holocaust.Natalia Sawka, “Antysemita Leszek Żebrowski poprowadzi wykład o ‘żołnierzach wyklętych,’” Gazeta Wyborcza, March 1, 2016 Scale of Polish collaboration Myth 4: \"<1% Poles collaborated with Nazi occupiers.\"The “Israeli War Crimes Commission” statistics seem to originate from an essay from the 1960s by one Leo Heiman, which provides no footnote. Leo Heiman, “Ukrainians and the Jews,” in Ukrainians and Jews, Articles, Testimonies, Letters and Official Documents Dealing with Interrelations of Ukrainians and Jews in the Past and Present: A Symposium (New York: The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, 1966), p. 60. Fact: Several independent research showed otherwise.Machcewicz and Persak, (eds.), Wokół Jedwabnego; Jan Grabowski and Barbara Engelking, (eds.), Dalej jest noc: losy Żydów w wybranych powiatach okupowanej Polski (Night Without End: The Fate of Jews in Selected Counties of Occupied Poland), 2 vols. (Warsaw: Polish Center for Holocaust Research, 2018). Polish Blue Police Myth 5: \"Many Polish Blue Police were executed for refusing to follow Nazi orders to arrest Jews.\"Engelking and Grabowski, (eds.), Dalej jest noc; Grzegorz Rossolinski-Liebe, “Polnische Bürgermeister und der Holocaust im Generalgouvernement Besatzung, Kollaboration und Handlungsmöglichkeiten,” Bulletin des Fritz Bauer Instituts, (2021), pp. 26–35. Fact: Proven cases have not been found by mainstream historians yet. Instead, the Polish Blue Police helped Nazi occupiers kill Jews enthusiastically. * * * Polish Underground State Myth 6: \"The Polish Underground State's court investigated 17,000 suspected Polish collaborators and sentenced 3,500 to death.\" Fact: No more than seven collaborators were sentenced to death by the Polish Underground State's court,Andrzej Żbikowski, Polacy i Zydzi pod okupacja niemiecką, 1939-1945: Studia i Materiały (Warsaw: IPN, 2006), pp. 482–84. despite desperate requests from the Committee to Aid Jews (Żegota). Policies against helping Jews Myth 7: \"Poles were specifically targeted by the Nazis for helping Jews. The Nazis imposed death penalty on Poles because of this.\" Fact: Nazi laws against helping Jews were applied equally to millions of non- German subjects under Nazi occupation.The Third Decree of General Governor Hans Frank concerning restrictions on residency in the Generalgouvernement and introducing the death penalty for aid rendered to Jews, October 15, 1941; Verordnungsblatt für das Generalgouvernement. Dziennik Rozporządzeń dla Generalnego Gubernatorstwa, Cracow, October 25, 1941, p. 595. The death penalty was introduced on October 15, 1941, long before any obvious help could have been noticed. Revelation of the Holocaust Myth 8: \"Polish Army officer Witold Pilecki told the Allies about the Holocaust via Polish government-in- exile courier Jan Karski.\" Fact: Jan Karski did not tell the Allies about the Holocaust.Adam Puławski, “Revisiting Jan Karski’s Final Mission,” Israeli Journal of Foreign Affairs, vol. 15, no. 2 (2021): pp. 289–97; Adam Puławski, Wobec niespotykanego w dziejach mordu. Rząd RP na uchodźstwie, Delegatura Rządu RP na Kraj, AK a eksterminacja ludności żydowskiej od wielkiej akcji do powstania w getcie warszawskim (Chełm: Stowarzyszenie Rocznik Chełmski, 2018). Karski left Poland in fall 1942, while Pilecki did not write a report about the Holocaust until summer 1943, when most Polish Jews had already been killed. Pilecki could not have given Karski a report that did not exist when Karski left. Nazi reprisals against Poles helping Jews Myth 9: \"The Nazi murdered 20,000 Polish villagers in Białka over some of them helping Jews.\"Wikipedia article, “Nazi Crimes Against the Polish Nation,” Wikipedia, revision from 14:14, June 15, 2022, Fact: It is true that individual shootings of Białka's Polish villagers happened, but the confirmed death toll was 96.Geoffrey P.

Post-war pogroms against Jews Myth 10: \"The July 1946 Kielce pogrom was planned by the Soviet occupiers.\" Fact: The claim has been roundly rejected by mainstream scholars, including Joanna Tokarska-Bakir who won the 2019 Yad Vashem International Book Award for a book that disproved the claim, which is only held by some Polish nationalists and conspiracy theorists. In 2024, independent journalists uncovered a large-scale off-site canvassing campaign to rewrite Jewish history and reshape the narrative surrounding the Israel–Palestine conflict, which involved 40 accounts having made as many as 2,000,000 edits to around 10,000 Jewish-related articles. * * * The off-site canvassing campaign was coordinated by an 8,000-member Tech for Palestine Discord channel, where the organizers provided the participants in-depth training (e.g. strategy planning sessions, group audio \"office hour\" chats) on getting used to Wikipedia's site operation, assigning participants (in groups of 2~3) to edit hundreds of articles in rotation and gaming the rules to block others from correcting them. Reported examples of their revisionist edits include Summary Edits * Removal of \"Land of Israel\" from the origin of Jews in Jewish-related articles * Removal of mentions of 16th century Jewish immigration to Israel in Jewish- related articles * Removal of mentions of Hamas' 1988 charter which involved the incitement to mass murder of Jews * Removal of mentions of the Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem's alliance with Hitler * * * * * * * * * * in Holocaust-related articles * Redefinition of Jews as an \"ethnoreligious group and cultural community\" from \"ethnoreligious group and nation from the Levant\" in Jewish-related articles On 12 December 2024, English Wikipedia's arbitration committee announced that two editors * * had been site-banned indefinitely for off-site canvassing and \"encouraging other users to game the extended confirmed restriction and engage in disruptive editing.\" Another three editors have also been sanctioned for similar reasons. On January 17, 2025, English Wikipedia's arbitration committee further voted to impose indefinite topic-bans on multiple longtime editors associated with the organized campaign. * * * * ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt commented, ===Prominent Holocaust deniers=== Name Birth Death Origin Affiliations Ali Khamenei * * * * * * April 19, 1939 Mashhad, Iran Supreme Leader of Iran David Irving * * * * * March 24, 1938 Hutton, Essex, England A \"historian\" who is an alumnus of the ICL and UCL Ernst Zündel\"Holocaust denier in Germany sentenced to five years in prison – Europe – International Herald Tribune\", The New York Times, February 15, 2007.

Jurij Dobczansky, a senior Library of Congress cataloging specialist, said: ===Examples=== Since the 1930s, many Western scholars have denied the Holodomor for different reasons, mainly out of communist sympathies, which prevent them from recognizing Ukrainians as equal humans. Such denial is considered racist and dehumanizing. * * * * * * * * ====Soviet Union==== The Soviet Union's regime is said to have denied the Holodomor throughout its existence. * Catherine Merridale, \"The 1937 Census and the Limits of Stalinist Rule\" _Historical Journal_ 39, 1996. * Boriak, Hennadii (Fall 2001). \"The publication of sources on the history of the 1932-1933 famine-genocide: history, current state, and prospects\".

The Yiddish Jewish Daily Forward was one of the media that reported the Holodomor. Shortly after, it was accused by the Soviet-fundedHarvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Kyrill M. Anderson, The Soviet World of American Communism, Yale University Press (1998); . Communist Party USA (CPUSA) of \"spreading Nazi-inspired lies\", despite the magazine being run by Jewish Americans. Many left-wing scholars, with huge influence in Western academia, teamed up with the CPUSA to smear Jewish activists who raised awareness about the Holodomor. In recent years, the CPUSA and their academic allies are said to have supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Writing for The New Voice of Ukraine, Kyiv-based film critic Oleksandra Povoroznyk noted: ====Walter Duranty==== Walter Duranty, a Moscow-based New York Times journalist in the 1930s, wrote a series of articles denying the Holodomor and praising Joseph Stalin, while millions of Ukrainians starved to death. The articles ironically won Duranty the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, which caused controversies in the following decades. In 2003, the New York Times and Pulitzer Prize board reviewed Duranty's articles separately, yet declined to withdraw his prize. Oksana Piaseckyj, a Ukrainian-American activist who fled to the United States as a child in 1950, referred to Walter Duranty as \"the personification of evil in journalism.\" This case has become the biggest scandal in the history of the New York Times. * * * * * ===Responses=== ====Ukraine==== Ukraine passed the in 2006 to ban Holodomor denial, recognizing it as an insult to the memory of victims and humiliation of the dignity of Ukrainians. ====Germany==== In November 2022, Germany recognized the Holodomor as a genocide, while changing a law to ban the approval, denial, and \"gross trivialization\" of genocides or war crimes in the new paragraph 5 of section 130 of the German Penal Code ‒ the Strafgesetzbuch. ==Cambodian genocide denial== Similar to Holocaust denial, Cambodian genocide denial is the belief that the Cambodian genocide ( or ), which killed as many as 3,000,000 ( of the Cambodian population), * * * * * did not happen or was not as bad as commonly believed. ===Academia=== On the debate about the Cambodian genocide, American political scientist Donald W. Beachler remarked,Beachler, Donald W. (2009) \"Arguing about Cambodia: Genocide and Political Interest\" Holocaust and Genocide Studies 23(2):214–38. Despite the abundance of verified testimonies from Cambodian refugees and foreign witnesses, Cambodian genocide denial within academia was widespread in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Australia etc. ====Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman==== With the transnational academic-cultural network tied to their status in Western academia, * * * * American scholars Noam Chomsky (1928 – ) and Edward S. Herman (1925 – 2017) published several books making the survivors look bad, opposing the genocide classification and the confirmed death toll of the Cambodian genocide, which influenced hundreds of millions worldwide into doing the same. ====Gareth Porter==== In 1976, American historian Gareth Porter (1942 – ) co-authored the book Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution with George Hildebrand in which he denied that one million Cambodians had already been killed by the Khmer Rouge. On May 3, 1977, Porter repeated his denial at the Solarz hearing in the U.S. Congress.Human Rights in Cambodia.\" Hearing Before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, 95th Congress, 1st Session. 1977 May 3. Also available via Google Books. Historians have been critical of Cambodia: Starvation and Revolution. Particularly, historian Bruce Sharp researched the citations of that book. Of the 50 citations in a chapter of that book, 33 were traced to Khmer Rouge state propaganda, while 6 from that of the CCP, which served as a proof of their confirmation bias and intellectual dishonesty. Recalling the encounter later in his life, Solarz called Porter's Cambodian genocide denial \"cowardly and contemptible,\" comparing him to those who denied the Holocaust.Thompson, Larry Clinton. 2010. Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975–1982. Jefferson, NC: MacFarland. ====Samir Amin==== Egyptian-French economist Samir Amin had been a good friend of Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan since the time they were studying in France. When the Cambodian genocide was exposed, Amin continued to praise the Khmer Rouge as the most superior communist model. When asked again about the Cambodian genocide in 1986, Amin responded with an inversion of reality by blaming the \"American imperialists\", the Vietnamese communists, and Lon Nol for the suffering of the Cambodians. ===Responses=== ====François Ponchaud==== François Ponchaud (1939 – ) is a French priest who lived in Cambodia during the genocide. As a witness, he documented the genocide in his book Cambodge Année Zéro (Cambodia: Year Zero), which attracted biased criticism from Noam Chomsky and Gareth Porter who denied the genocide. In response, Ponchaud called out their intellectual dishonesty, ====Sophal Ear==== Cambodian-American historian Sophal Ear satirically referred to the biased narrative of pro-Khmer Rouge Western academic leftists as the Standard Total Academic View on Cambodia (STAV), ====William Shawcross==== British journalist William Shawcross criticized the STAV academics as well. His criticism was endorsed by human rights activist David Hawk who pointed out that ====Jakob Guhl==== Jakob Guhl, the Senior Manager, Policy and Research of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said that Cambodian genocide denial among Western academic leftists was rooted in their dogmatic rejection of liberal democracy, presumption of \"moral superiority\" of anti-capitalist regimes and division of political actors into binary categories (oppressors vs. oppressed) to justify \"anti-hierarchical aggression\" towards hypothetical oppressors, who are dehumanized to have their suffering denied. ==Rwandan genocide denial== Rwandan genocide denial is the denial of the Rwandan genocide, * * * * * which happened in 1994 Rwanda and involved the systematic mass murder of approximately 800,000 (mostly Tutsis) within 100 days. * * * * * * * * * * Since the end of the Rwandan genocide, there have been deniers of the genocide worldwide across the political spectrum. ===Edward S. Herman and David Peterson=== Two of the notable deniers were American economist Edward S. Herman (1925 – 2017) and David Peterson. They published two books in 2010 and 2014 respectively accusing Western media of \"selling\" the Rwandan genocide as a genocide for the sake of \"promoting\" what they claimed to be \"economic and intellectual agendas of the U.S.\", despite the actual lack of Western media attention to the events during the Rwandan genocide. Meanwhile, Edward S. Herman had published several books objecting to the genocide classification and the confirmed death toll of the Cambodian genocide and Bosnian genocide, * * * * * * * * * * making him a subject of media criticism. ===Charles Onana=== In December 2024, French-Cameroonian writer Charles Onana was convicted of downplaying the Rwandan genocide. * * * He was ordered to pay €8,400, while his publisher to pay €5,000, as the laws in France ban the denial of any genocide recognized by the French government. ==Inquisition denial== From 1478 to 1834, the Catholic Spanish Empire unleashed a systematic campaign of persecution of Jews, historically known as the Spanish Inquisition, * * * * * * * * * * due to its racist belief that Jews who converted to Catholicism (conversos) were mostly faking as Christians, including those forcibly converted following the Alhambra Decree, or the Edict of Expulsion. As many as 300,000 Jews under Catholic Spanish rule were killed over false charges of \"crypto-Judaism\", a charge slapped on Jews who were forcibly converted. Since the end of Francisco Franco's regime in the late 1970s, archives of the Spanish Inquisition have begun to be declassified for historical research. Since then, many have been presenting different versions of the history to trivialize the Inquisition. ===Vatican=== In 2004, the Roman Catholic Church published findings that the judges of the Inquisition were \"not as brutal as previously believed\". * * * The Church also denied that most trials were carried out by Catholic courts, while claiming that the victims on trial were often \"tortured for only 15 minutes in the presence of doctors\". ===Spain=== For the past decade, movements within Spain have emerged to rewrite the history of the Spanish Inquisition. Members of the movements released a series of books, films, TV programs and mobile exhibitions to beautify the Inquisition-associated Spanish history. ==Irish slaves myth== The Irish slaves myth is a conspiracy theory claiming that Irish slaves existed in 17th century North America before the arrival of African slaves. * * * * * * * * * * ===Origin=== The myth reportedly originated from the book To Hell Or Barbados: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ireland written by Irish journalist Seán O'Callaghan (1918 – 2000) and published by The O'Brien Press in Dublin, Ireland. The myth has been made popular by Neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers in both Ireland and the United States (US) since 2013. ===Reception=== The myth has been widely condemned by scholars as a far-right conspiracy theory downplaying the suffering of African Americans in history, who were enslaved until 1865, segregated until 1965 and systemically discriminated against until now. * * * * * Despite To Hell Or Barbados: The Ethnic Cleansing of Ireland promoting the widely condemned far-right myth, the book is still on sale in the Sinn Féin Bookshop run by the Irish nationalist Sinn Féin party. * * * * * ==Khazar myth== Khazar myth, also known as the Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi origin, is a disproven antisemitic conspiracy theory * * * * * Rory Miller(2020) The anti-Zionist ‘Jewish Khazar’ syndrome in the official British mind claiming that \"European Jews descended from the Khazars\".

Ahearn speculates that [Ezra] Pound may have thought:'If there were no such people as Jews, then the problem of indiscriminate anti-Semitism would disappear. On could focus one’s attention on usurers of whatever description.' KKK,.'The formative period of Christian Identity could roughly be said to be the three decades between 1940 and 1970. Through missionaries like Wesley Swift, Bertrand Comparet and William Potter Gale, it took on a white racialist, anti-Semitic, anti-Communist and far-right conservative political outlook. Combined with the teachings of early disciples Richard G. Butler, Colonel Jack Mohr and James K. Warner, a distinctly racist theology was gradually formed. Whites were said to be the Adamic people, created in His likeness. A notion of a pre-earthly existence is found in an important substratum, teaching that whites either had a spiritual or extraterrestrial pre-existence. Blacks were either pre-Adamic soulless creatures or represented fallen, evil spirits, but they were not the chief target of fear and hatred. This position was reserved for Jews. The latent anti-Semitism found in British-Israelism rose to prominence. Jews were, at best, reduced to mongrelized imposters, not infrequently identified with Eurasian Khazars without any legitimate claim to a closeness with God, and at worst denounced as the offspring of Satan.' Neo-Nazis, Arab nationalists,: \"Arab anti-Semitism might have been expected to be free from the idea of racial odium, since Jews and Arabs are both regarded by race theory as Semites, but the odium is directed, not against the Semitic race, but against the Jews as a historical group. The main idea is that the Jews, racially, are a mongrel community, most of them being not Semites, but of Khazar and European origin.\" This essay was translated from Harkabi Hebrew text 'Arab Antisemitism' in Shmuel Ettinger, Continuity and Discontinuity in Antisemitism (Hebrew), 1968, p.50. the Nation of Islam (NOI) and the Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI). Particularly, at a 1947 UN conference on the Partition Plan for Palestine, Arab nationalist speakers Faris al-Khoury and Jamal Al-Husseini cited the Khazar myth to deny the historical connection of Jews to the land and oppose the founding of the modern State of Israel, which has also become a main theme in contemporary antisemitic propaganda worldwide, * * * * * with a substantial degree of influence in Western academia. In an article, historian Dr. Eunice G. Pollack summarized the common beliefs about Jews held by the BHI and NOI: * Judaism is a \"dirty religion\" * All Jews are \"imposter Jews\" * Jews \"ran the Atlantic slave trade\" * European Jews \"descended from the Khazars\" * Black Americans are the \"real Jews\", who \"cannot be antisemitic\" towards \"themselves\" no matter what they think about Jews Dr. Pollack also outlined the differences in the beliefs about Jews held by the BHI and NOI: Name Beliefs Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI) * Jesus was Black rather than Jewish * Black people are the \"real chosen people\" * Judaism was \"invented by KenitesDescendants of Cain. 2,000 years ago\" * Jews \"infiltrated the Levite tribe\" to \"rewrite the Torah\" for \"creating pagan converts\" * Jews \"stole the identity of the BHI to serve Satan\" Nation of Islam (NOI) * Jews are \"servants of Satan\" * Islam is the \"real Judaism\" * Jews \"originated from Europe 4,000 years ago\" * Jews \"changed the Torah\" to \"justify the enslavement of Black people\" ===Research=== As mentioned above, the Khazar myth is an unscientific conspiracy theory. Eran Elhaik, an Israeli-American scholar who published controversial papers claiming to have found evidence for the Khazar myth, was criticized by several other biologists who conducted genetic studies to disprove his claims. In response, Elhaik accused the biologists of being \"liars\" and \"frauds\", denying that he had ever misused his genomic data to \"defame the Jewish people\", despite Elhaik's papers lending support to antisemites who are promoting the Khazar myth. ==Other examples== * 9/11 conspiracy theories * * * * * * Moon landing conspiracy theories * * * * * * John F.
