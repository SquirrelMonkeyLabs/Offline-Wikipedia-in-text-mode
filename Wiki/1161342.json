 "text": "Jews started living in the Arabian Peninsula in the 6th century BC, when Babylonian Empire's conquest of the Kingdom of Judah forced Jews out of Judea () located in the Land of Israel (). ==Overview== Successive waves of Jewish exiles – caused by alternating conquests of Judea – made Jews the leading ethnoreligious group in the Arabian Peninsula, where Judaism stood in contrast to the multi-god religion of ancient Arabs, many of whom had arrived later than the Jews due to their nomadic nature. ==Middle Ages== Jews thrived in the Arabian Peninsula until Muslims conquered the Peninsula, when they, along with other conquered indigenous peoples, were required to pay jizya in exchange for their existence to be tolerated. * * * The payment of jizya granted Jews the status of dhimmi under which they were prohibited – under the threat of execution – from criticizing any aspects of Islam, sharing Jewish ideas to Muslims or touching a Muslim woman. * * * * * Jews were also not allowed to * drink wine in public * ride horses or camels * pray or mourn in loud voices * build synagogues taller than mosques * construct houses taller than Muslim houses ==Selected list of Jewish tribes== Several Jewish tribes are reported to have lived in the Arabian Peninsula on the eve of their conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate: * Banu Awf * Banu Juw * Banu Nadir * Banu HarithNorman A.
