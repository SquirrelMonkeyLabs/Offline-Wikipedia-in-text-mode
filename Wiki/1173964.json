Jalaleddin waited here until the winter season approached, and when the severe cold started and it started to snow, he finally left Ahlat on December 16, 1226.

The Emir of Amid and Hisni Keyfa, Melik Masud, and the Emir of Mardin, Melik el Mansur, wanted to support Celaleddin against the Seljuk Sultan of Anatolia and the Ayyubid kings of Egypt and Syria. Meanwhile, Celaleddin Khwarazmshah ignored Alaaddin Keykubad's warnings and continued the siege of Ahlat. The walls were battered with the catapults that were set up and the siege continued.
