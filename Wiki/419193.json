 "text": "The Diderot effect is a phenomenon from sociology, which was named after Denis Diderot, who first described it in an essay. In the essay, Diderot talked about a robe he used to wear in the bathroom: The old robe was a little shabby, but useful. When he was given a new robe, the new robe was more shiny, and nicer, but it did not fit well with the other clothes. Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown: I was absolute master of my old dressing gown,” Diderot writes, “but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain.Diderot, Denis (1875-77) Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre [Regrets on My Old Dressing Gown]. Paris: Garnier. Instead of feeling grateful for his new robe, Diderot descended into a cycle of dissatisfaction. He lamented the absence of coordination and beauty in his life, as the new robe clashed with his modest belongings. This prompted him to acquire more, leading to an overwhelming excess, luxury, debt, and ultimately, deeper dissatisfaction. So, the Diderot effect describes that people often show a tendency to buy more goods after they bought one item. It is said that they do this to restore the general perception they had about their belongings. == References == Category:Sociology Category:Economic theories",
