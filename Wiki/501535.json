She is the daughter of William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales. She is a granddaughter of King Charles III. She is a great-granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II. She was born at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London. She is the third in line to succeed King Charles III after her father, and older brother. She is the first member of the royal family born after the change to the law on 26 March 2015, which removed gender from consideration in succession. This means she is higher in the line of succession than her younger brother, Prince Louis. This is the first time a female has been in that position. == Titles == * 2 May 2015-8 September 2022: Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge * 8 September 2022-9 September 2022: Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cornwall and Cambridge * 9 September-present: Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Wales ==References== |- Category:2015 births Category:Living people Category:British princesses Category:English Anglicans Category:House of Windsor Category:People from Paddington Category:Royalty from London Category:Royal children",
