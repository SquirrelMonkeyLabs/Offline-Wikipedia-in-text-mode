She studied at lyc√©e Descartes High School, which was first represented on her stage and then to Rabat. By age 16 she was caring for cats both in her home and on the street. == Career == In 2004, Habiba founded the animal defense association Assoadan with her brother Ahmed. Together they cared for hundreds of dogs in the shelter in downtown Rabat. Habiba also turned her house into a refuge for dozens of cats, which she describes as her children. In 2014, she became president of the Moroccan Association for the Defense and Protection of Domestic and Wild Animals. In 2017, Assoadan signed an agreement with Rabat authorities to create programs to vaccinate street dogs and cats. Its videos are in Moroccan dialect and assoadan maintains good relations with other Moroccan foundations, thus avoiding entering into conflicts or rivalry with them, which reinforces its notoriety in the Arab world. ==References== ==Other websites== *alalam.ir *9avril.ma *snrtnews.com *bladi.net *ruptly.tv Category:1979 births Category:Living people",
