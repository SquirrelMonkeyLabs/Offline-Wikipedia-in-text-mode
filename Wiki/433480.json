 "text": "A nonverbal learning disorder (or nonverbal learning disability), or NVLD, is a neurological problem. People with the disorder have good verbal skills, but they have problems with motor skills, social skills and other areas. A person with NVLD also has problems in non-verbal problem solving, understanding humor and rote learning (remembering something by repeating it). NVLD is linked with autism spectrum disorders, mostly autism or Asperger's. Most people with either high-functioning autism or Asperger fit this actual type. This condition, though, is also tied to depression and anxiety. Nonverbal learning disabilities affect one in ten learning disabled children. While the term NLVD is commonly used to describe learning styles, NVLD is not recognised by the DSM-5 and is not clinically distinct from learning disorders.Dupaul, George J.; Gormley, Matthew J.; Laracy, Seth D.
