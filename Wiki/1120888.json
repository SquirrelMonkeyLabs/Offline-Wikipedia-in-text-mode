 "text": "The 2024 presidential campaign of Kamala Harris was an unsuccessful presidential campaign of Kamala Harris, the 49th vice president. Harris ran for president in the 2024 presidential election after she began her campaign on July 21, 2024, after Joe Biden ended his campaign. That day, Biden said he supported her to be the next president. Harris was not a candidate in any of the Democratic primary elections. Joe Biden won the primary elections, but the delegates at the 2024 Democratic National Convention are allowed to vote for her, because Biden ended his campaign. By July 22, most of the delegates said they would vote for Harris, enough for her to become the presumptive nominee. On August 6, 2024, Harris picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. In November 2024, the Harris-Walz ticked lost the election to then- former President Donald Trump and then-Ohio U.S. Senator JD Vance. ==References== Harris 2024 presidential campaign",
