 "text": "Phoneutria is a genus of spiders which are dangerous to human beings. Their venom is more powerful, drop for drop, than other venoms. They are called \"armed spiders\" in Portuguese because their venom is a powerful weapon. Their body length goes from 17 to 48 mm (0.7–1.9 in).Martins R. & Bertani R. 2007. The non-Amazonian species of the Brazilian wandering spiders of the genus Phoneutria Perty, 1833 (Araneae: Ctenidae), with the description of a new species. Zootaxa. 1526 (5): 1–36. These spiders live in Central America and South America. They hide in the daytime and walk around looking for food at night. So in English they are called 'wandering spiders'. There are several species, and only Phoneutria fera can kill healthy adult humans. People who get bitten by Phoneutria spiders can be given an antivenom. In any event, their degree of toxicity has been challenged.Wandering Spiders of the Amazon (2013). Phoneutria - toxicity. Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe (State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe). Retrieved 23 February 2013. The spiders may be able to control the amount of venom they inject. There are about eight species in this genus. ==References== Category:Araneomorphae",
