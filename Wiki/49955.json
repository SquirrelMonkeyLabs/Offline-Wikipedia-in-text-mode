 "text": "Microsoft PowerPoint is a presentation program developed for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS computer operating systems. Businesspeople, educators, and trainers use it often. It is a component of the Microsoft Office system. == Operation == In PowerPoint, as in most other presentation software, text, graphics, movies, and other objects are positioned on individual pages or \"slides\". The \"slide\" analogy is a reference to the slide projector. Slides can be printed, or (more often) displayed on-screen and navigated through at the command of the presenter. Slides can also form the basis of webcasts. == Versions == Versions for Microsoft Windows include: * 1993 PowerPoint 4.0 (Office 4.x) * 1995 PowerPoint 7 for Windows 95 (Office '95) * 1997 PowerPoint 97 (Office '97) * 1999 PowerPoint 2000 (Office 2000) * 2001 PowerPoint 2002 (Office XP) * 2003 PowerPoint 2003 (Office 2003) * 2006-2007 PowerPoint 2007 (Office 2007) * 2010 PowerPoint 2010 (Office 2010) * 2016 PowerPoint 2016 (Office 2016) * 2018 PowerPoint 2019 (Office 2019) Note: There is no PowerPoint 5.0 or 6.0, because the Windows 95 version was launched with Word 7. All of the Office 95 products have OLE 2 - moving data between many programs - and PowerPoint 7 shows that it was as new as Word 7. ==Related pages== * LibreOffice Impress, a free, open source alternative to Microsoft PowerPoint * Apple Keynote == Other websites == * Official website of PowerPoint at Microsoft * flashgeek PowerPoint tutorials and community, especially in regards to using PowerPoint in combination with Macromedia Flash. * PowerPoint Heaven — The Power to Animate Contains PowerPoint movies, showcases, PowerPoint games, animation templates and tutorials on creating animations for your PowerPoint Presentations. * PowerPoint FAQ pages Compilation of Frequently Asked Questions in the Microsoft Office PowerPoint Discussion Groups. * Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2003 Download (freeware, 1.9 MiB.)
