He was a chocolate manufacturer who used the name Côte d'Or which was French for Gold Coast. This is the old name of Ghana where most of the cacao beans used in chocolate manufacturing come from. Côte d'Or was purchased by Jacobs Suchard in 1987. Jacobs Suchard in turn was purchased by Kraft General Foods in 1990. Belgians eat 600 million Côte d'Or products a year. Every day, the Côte d'Or factory in Halle makes 1.3 million mignonnettes (small chocolate bars), and 2 million Chokotoffs (chocolate bonbons). Currently Côte d’Or is sold in more than 20 countries, across 5 continents. == References == == Other websites == * Côte d'Or Website Category:Food companies of Belgium Category:Chocolate bars Category:Belgian culture Category:1883 establishments in Europe Category:19th-century establishments in Belgium",
