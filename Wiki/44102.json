When someone in politics seeks election to a political office, that is called a \"political campaign\". Sometimes, a series of advertisements can be referred to as an \"advertising campaign\". A \"blood drive\", when the Red Cross or a hospital asks people to give blood, is also a campaign. A campaign usually involves groups of people following a plan and working together in different ways to get what they want. Category:Voting Category:Military Category:Marketing",
