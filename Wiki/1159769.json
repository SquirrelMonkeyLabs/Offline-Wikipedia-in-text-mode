 "text": "Ermita is a district in central Manila, Philippines. It is a significant center of culture, parks, education and city governance. Ermita serves as Manila's civic center bearing a large portion of the area's employment, business and entertainment activities. Ermita and its neighboring district Malate were posh neighborhoods of Manila's affluent families during the early 20th century, where large, grandiose mansions once stood. The district and its surroundings were heavily bombed and flattened during the Second World War after which it underwent commercialization. == History == Ermita had the original name of \"Lagyo\", as recorded by Miguel de Loarca in 1582. Lagyo was re-christened in the 17th century as La Hermita (Spanish for \"the hermitage\") after a Mexican hermit's residence in the area housing an image of the Virgin Mary known as the Nuestra Señora de Guia (Our Lady of Guidance). The hermit- priest's name was Juan Fernandez de Leon, who was a cleric in Mexico before relocating to Manila.\"Jesuits In The Philippines (1581–1768)\" Page 132 \"In 1591 there arrived in Manila a secular priest named Juan Fernandez de Leon. He had led a hermit's life in Mexico and planned to continue it in the Philippines. For this purpose he built himself a retreat near a wayside shrine just outside the city walls, dedicated to Our Lady of Guidance, Nuestra Sehora de Guia. His hermitage later gave its name to the entire district, which is called Ermita to this day.\" == References== Category:Settlements in Manila Category:Districts of Manila",
