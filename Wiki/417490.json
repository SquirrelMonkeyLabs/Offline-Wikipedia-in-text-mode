 "text": "Food photography is art made by taking photos of food. These photos are sometimes used for menus in restaurants, but they can also be used for advertising, or in a cookbook. System catering also needs images of their food. There are a number of techniques that are used when taking pictures of food, for example, when taking pictures of soft drinks, fake ice cubes are put in the drink instead of real ones, because real ice cubes would melt quickly.
