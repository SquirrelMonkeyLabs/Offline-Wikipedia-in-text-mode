 "text": "National days are the days which are very special and important for a nation. A National day is a special day where people celebrate their country or nation each year. Most countries have national days and they are usually a national holiday, where people don't go to work or school. In many countries which used to be colonies, the national day is known as because it remembers the day they became independent from their old empire. In other countries like China, the national day remembers when the old government of the country changed to the new one. In the past, the king or emperor's birthdays were often treated as a kind of national day. Most countries have only one national day each year but some (like India, Bangladesh and Pakistan) have more than one. The different parts of the United Kingdom used to be separate independent nations and still have national days, but the UK does not have one holiday for the whole country apart from the Queen's Official Birthday. (This isn't her real birthday or an official holiday, but a special Saturday to remember her when people are usually already off work anyway.) Denmark is another country that has no official national day. ==List of national days== : A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W Y Z See also ===A=== * Afghanistan 19 August (Independence from United Kingdom's control over Afghan foreign affairs in 1919) * Albania 28 November (\"Dita e Pavarësisë\", declaration of independence from Ottoman rule in 1912) * Alderney, Guensey British Islands 9 May (Liberation Day, the end of the German Occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II 1945) * Algeria 1 November (start of the War of Independence in 1954) * American Samoa (US) 17 April (Flag Day) * Andalusia, Spain 28 February (Dia de Andalucia) * Andorra 8 September (Our Lady of Meritxell Day, patron saint of Andorra) * Angola 11 November (Independence from Portugal in 1975) * Anguilla, United Kingdom 30 May (Anguilla Day; the beginning of the Anguillian Revolution in 1967) * Antigua and Barbuda 1 November (Independence from the United Kingdom in 1981) * Aragon, Spain 23 April (St George's Day, patron saint) * Argentina 25 May (First Patriotic Government, the Spanish viceroy is removed and replaced by the Primera Junta during the May Revolution) and 9 July (Declaration of Independence, from Spain in 1816) * Armenia 28 May (Republic Day, independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic 1918) * Aruba (Kingdom of the Netherlands) 18 March (Flag Day: autonomy within the Netherlands in 1945) * Australia 26 January (Australia Day, date of the founding of Sydney, the first European settlement in Australia, 1788) * Austria 26 October (The Neutrality Constitution of 1955) * Azerbaijan 28 May (Independence Day, independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic 1918) ===B=== * Bahamas 10 July (Independence from the United Kingdom in 1973) * Bahrain 16 December (Accession Day for the late Amir Sh.
