 "text": "Spanish broom (Spartium junceum, syn. Genista juncea), also known as weaver's broom, is a perennial, leguminous shrub that grows in the Mediterranean region in southern Europe, southwest Asia and northwest Africa, where it is found in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils. It is the sole species in the genus Spartium, but is closely related to the other brooms in the genera Cytisus and Genista. Spanish broom typically grows to 2-4 m tall, rarely 5 m, with main stems up to 5 cm thick, rarely 10 cm. ==References== *Germplasm Resources Information Network: Spartium junceum Broom, Spanish",
