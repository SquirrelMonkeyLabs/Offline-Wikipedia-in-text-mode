 "text": "Amanishakheto was a queen regnant (kandake) of Kush who reigned in the early 1st century CE. In Meroitic hieroglyphs her name is written \"Amanikasheto\" (Mniskhte or (Am)niskhete). In Meroitic cursive she is referred to as Amaniskheto qor kd(ke) which means Amanishakheto, Qore and Kandake (\"Ruler and Queen\"). Amanishakheto is believed to have been the direct successor of the earlier queen regnant Amanirenas. Amanishakheto's mother is recorded to have been named Ar(...)tḫwit; the relation between Amanishakheto and Amanirenas is thus unknown. The chronologically next Kushite ruler, and thus Amanishakheto's possible successor, was another queen regnant, Shanakdakhete. ==Gallery== ==Related pages== *Kandake (royal title) ==References== ==Further reading== *Török, László, in: Fontes Historiae Nubiorum Vol. II, p. 723–725 (Bergen, 1996). *Török, László, “The Kingdom of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization,” in The Kingdom of Kush: Handbook of the Napatan-Meroitic Civilization (New York: Brill, 1998), pp. 456\\. . *Vela-Rodrigo, Alberto A., in: The sacred treasure of Queen Amanishakheto, Ancient Egypt Magazine, 21(5), 2021, 44–50. *Shinnie, P.
