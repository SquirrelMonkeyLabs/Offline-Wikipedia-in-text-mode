 "text": "Musical instruments are things used to make music. Anything that somehow produces sound can be considered a musical instrument, but the term generally means items that are specifically for making music. Musical instruments can be divided by type into: * string instruments (plucked or bowed) * wind instruments ** woodwind ** brass * percussion instruments * keyboard instruments An orchestra has instruments from four families: * bowed string instruments (e.g. violin) * woodwind (e.g. flute) * brass (e.g. trumpet) * percussion (e.g. drums) Some people think that the voice is a \"natural musical instrument\" because singing is a way to make music without any instrument at all.",
