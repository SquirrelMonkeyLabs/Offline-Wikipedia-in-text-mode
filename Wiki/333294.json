 "text": "Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Jesus, by Jonh, as written in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament. The seven trumpets are sounded by seven angels and the events that follow are described in detail from Revelation Chapters 8 to 11. According to Revelation 8:1-2, the angels sound these trumpets after the breaking of the seventh seal. These seals secured the apocalyptic document, that was in the right hand of God. ==Related pages== *Book of Revelation ==References== Category:New Testament Category:Christian eschatology",
