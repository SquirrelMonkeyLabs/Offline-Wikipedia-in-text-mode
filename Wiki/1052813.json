 "text": "The Balkhash perch (Perca schrenkii) is a perch that lives in Lake Balkhash and Lake Alakol. == Discovery and first scientific description == An expedition of Alexander von Schrenk to eastern Turkestan collected this species in 1842, and deposited preserved specimens at the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg; Karl Kessler's formal description was published much later, in 1874, after the rediscovered specimens were sent to him by Alexander Strauch. The description was included in an article on fishes collected by the later expedition to Turkestan of Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko. == Description == The Balkhash perch resembles the other species, the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the yellow perch (Perca flavescens), but has a slimmer build and is lighter in color. == References == # Froese, Rainer; Pauly, Daniel (eds.)
