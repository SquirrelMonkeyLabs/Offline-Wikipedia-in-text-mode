 "text": "The gluteal muscles are a group of three muscles that make up the buttock area; they are the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. == Muscles == === Gluteus maximus === The gluteus maximus is the largest of the group. One unique feature is that the gluteus maximus is larger in humans than in other primates, which can't stand up that well due to their flat hips. === Gluteus medius === The gluteus medius is a broad muscle. === Gluteus minimus === The gluteus minimus is the smallest of the gluteal muscles. It is shaped like a fan, arising from the outer surface of the ilium. == References == == Other websites == * 8b.
