 "text": "The George Wallace 1964 presidential campaign began on November 15, 1963, when Alabama Governor George Wallace announced his intention to run in the 1964 Democratic Party presidential primaries against then-incumbent President John F. Kennedy. Following the assassination of Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald 7 days later, Wallace continued his campaign against President Lyndon B. Johnson. Wallace ultimately earned only 10.8% of the popular vote and won no contests. He suspended his campaign live on Face the Nation on July 19, 1964, and allegedly began to support 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater. In the 1964 general election, Goldwater won Wallace's home state of Alabama by 39 points. This was the first of four presidential campaigns by George Wallace. Wallace ran again in the 1968 United States presidential election as the nominee of the American Independent Party, where he carried 5 states. He then went on to run in the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries and the 1976 Democratic Party presidential primaries, where he lost the nomination to George McGovern and Jimmy Carter, respectively. == Endorsements == In the summer of 1964, Wallace received the endorsement of restaurant owner and future Governor of Georgia Lester Maddox. == Legacy == According to The Washington Post, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke based his 1992 presidential campaign on Wallace's 1964 campaign. == Related pages == * 1964 Democratic Party presidential primaries * 1964 United States presidential election === Other 1964 presidential campaigns === * Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign * Lyndon B.
