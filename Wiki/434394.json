 "text": "Ancel Benjamin Keys (January 26, 1904 â€“ November 20, 2004) was an American scientist. He is known for researching human nutrition. On January 13, 1961, Keys was on the cover of Time magazine. Keys cherrypicked data in order to make it seem like saturated fats were the reason why heart disease was increasing. He criticized some work against sugars. When fellow scientist John Yudkin said that sugar plays a major role in heart disease, Keys wrote: > It is clear that Yudkin has no theoretical basis or experimental evidence to > support his claim for a major influence of dietary sucrose in the [cause] of > CHD; his claim that men who have CHD are excessive sugar eaters is nowhere > confirmed but is disproved by many studies superior in methodology and/or > magnitude to his own; and his \"evidence\" from population statistics and time > trends will not bear up under the most elementary critical examination. But > the propaganda keeps on reverberating ... Multiple studies have proved Keys wrong. Keys died when he was 100 years old. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:2004 deaths Category:American centenarians Category:Scientists from Colorado",
