 "text": "India's rail system, Indian Railways, is managed at a regional level as eighteen zonal railways. Each zone is headed by a General Manager. At the top is the Railway Board, a part of the Ministry of Railways. It is headed by a chairman who directly reports to the Railway Minister. The board has five other members. The General Managers of the zonal railways and the production units report to the board. There is a total of 71 divisions on the system nationwide. The divisions are primarily involved with train running but may also have locomotive sheds. Each division has all the functional organizations (both line and staff). The heads of these functional groups report to the DRM for administrative purposes but depend on the railway board and the zonal headquarters for policy guidelines. Category:Rail transport in India",
