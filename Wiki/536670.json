 "text": "Peristalsis is a process of contraction and relaxation of the muscle around parts of the alimentary canal. Peristalsis is also a series of contractions that pass from the mouth to the stomach. The most familiar example of this is in the oesophagus. In the oesophagus, peristalsis pushes the ball of food down the oesophagus. The smooth muscle of the oesophagus contracts and relaxes in sequence, and this pushes the ball of food down the oesophagus. The muscle is worked by a nervous mechanism called the \"migrating motor complex\". This works in one direction only, and also works in the lower regions of the digestive system.
