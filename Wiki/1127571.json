 "text": "Lieutenant Colonel Nicolás Gutiérrez was the temporary governor of Northern California twice in 1836. He first served from January to May and again from July to November. Gutiérrez was the temporary governor of California in 1836, during a turbulent period in the history of Mexican California. The Siete Leyes reforms to Mexico's government had combined the two territories of Alta California and Baja California into a single departamento under the pre-1804 Spanish-era name of Las Californias. His term began on January 2, 1836, succeeding acting governor José Castro, and Gutiérrez served as governor ad interim until the arrival of official appointee Mariano Chico. Chico, however, was unpopular and was dismissed for abandoning his post, and Gutiérrez returned to the job in July. Gutierrez was removed from his job as governor on November 5, 1836, when Juan Bautista Alvarado and José Castro, and a group of foreigners led by Isaac Graham took over. The battle was short and surrender was secured after the firing of just one artillery round at the governor's residence in Monterey. Gutierrez and his cadre of officers were detained at Cabo San Lucas on the English brig Clementine before returning to Mexico. Alvarado declared independence from Mexico. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Californios Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Governors of California",
