It is one of the three Manichaeism Dunhuang Chinese Documents. They are now held in the collection of National Library of China, number BD00256. == Overview == Luo Zhenyu didn't know which Persian religion the scriptures belonged to in 1911. He decided to publish the recorded text in the second volume of the \"Guoxue Series\". He named it \"Incomplete Persian Scripture\". In the same year, French Sinologists Shawan and Perch translated the scripture into French. They considered it as Manichaean scripture. The manuscript is on scrolls and has an incomplete beginning. It currently has 345 lines and about 7,000 characters. It is the only Chinese Manichean classic in China. The writing is similar to a scripture. The content uses a question and answer format between the leader Mani and the apostle Mar Adda. It explains Manichaeism's doctrine of the coexistence of light and dark.. == References == == Other websites == Category:Manichaeism Category:Pages with unreviewed translations Category:Manichaean texts",
