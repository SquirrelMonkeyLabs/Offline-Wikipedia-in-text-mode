 "text": "Tadeusz Reichstein (20 July 1897 1 August 1996) was a Polish-born Swiss chemist, botanist and Nobel laureate. Reichstein was born into a Jewish family at Włocławek, Congress Poland, and spent his early childhood at Kyiv, where his father was an engineer. He began his education at boarding-school in Jena, Germany. In 1933, working in Zürich, Switzerland, Reichstein made vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in what is now called the Reichstein process. Reichstein, E.C. Kendall and P.S. Hench were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950 for their discovery of cortisone. He died in Basel, Switzerland. The main industrial process for the artificial creation of Vitamin C still bears his name. Reichstein was the longest-lived Nobel laureate at the time of his death, but was beaten in 2008 by Rita Levi-Montalcini. ==References== * * * ==Other websites== *Brief bio on the Nobel Website Category:1897 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Swiss botanists Category:Jewish academics Category:Jewish Nobel Prize winners Category:Jewish scientists Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish Nobel Prize winners Category:Swiss chemists Category:Swiss Jews",
