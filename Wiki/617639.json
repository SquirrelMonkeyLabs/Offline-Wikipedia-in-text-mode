 "text": "Naomi Parker Fraley (August 26, 1921 â€“ January 20, 2018) was an American war worker and waitress. She is thought to be the likely model for the iconic \"We Can Do It!\" poster. She did not know that the poster had become famous and Geraldine Hoff Doyle was given credit as the model. The poster is mistakenly known as the Rosie the Riveter poster. It has become a cultural icon in the 1980s. She was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After the war, Parker worked as a waitress in Palm Springs, California. She was married three times. In February 2017 she moved to the Longview, Washington, area. Professor James J. Kimble began researching who the real Rosie the Riveter was, and believed it was based on a picture of Parker taken in 1942. He believed it could not have been Geraldine Doyle because she barely worked in factories because she was still in school. Through this, Parker based on current evidence, is believed to be the real-life Rosie the Riveter. Parker died in Longview on January 20, 2018 at the age of 96. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Models from Oklahoma Category:World War II people Category:People from Tulsa, Oklahoma",
