The name succotash is derived from the Narragansett word sahquttahhash, which means \"broken corn kernels\". Other ingredients may be added, such as onions, potatoes, turnips, tomatoes, bell peppers, corned beef, salt pork, or okra. Combining a grain with a legume provides a dish that is high in all essential amino acids. Category:Vegetable dishes",
