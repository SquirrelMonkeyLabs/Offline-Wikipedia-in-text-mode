 "text": "John Kramer—known as The Jigsaw Killer or simply Jigsaw—is a fictional character who appears in the Saw franchise as the main antagonist. Jigsaw made his appearance in the first movie of the series, Saw, and he later appeared in Saw II, Saw III, Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, Saw 3D and, eventually, Jigsaw. He is played by American actor Tobin Bell. Jigsaw ranks No. 30 in Empire magazine's \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\" list. ==Background== In the series' narrative, Kramer is a former civil engineer dying from an inoperable frontal lobe tumor that had developed from colon cancer. After a failed suicide attempt, Kramer found a new appreciation for his life, and went to dedicate the rest of his life to inspiring the same appreciation in others by testing their will to live. ==Tests== His methods include forcing his subjects through deadly scenarios, which he referred to as \"games\" or \"tests\", in which they were forced to inflict pain upon themselves or others in order to escape. These tests were typically symbolic of what Jigsaw perceived as a flaw in each person's moral character or life. The Jigsaw name was given to him by the media for his practice of cutting a puzzle piece shape of flesh from those who fail. His videos are recorded with a cheap homemade camera with Billy the Puppet instructing the subjects what to do to live. ==References== ==Other websites== * Jigsaw character description in the Saw video game Category:Fictional American people Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2004 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Movie characters Category:Saw (franchise)",
