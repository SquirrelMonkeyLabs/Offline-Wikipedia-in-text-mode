 "text": "Brandi Chastain (born July 21, 1968) is an American retired soccer player. Chastain is known for winning the 1999 Women's World Cup against China. The US beat China in a penalty shootout, and Chastain closed the deal by scoring the last penalty kick. For her celebration, she took off her shirt and had both fists in the air signaling the win in joy. Her celebration seemed strange to many people because women rarely took off their shirts during celebrations. Brandi helped start a Bay Area sports initiative where they help teach third- fifth graders health issues. She is in the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, American Freshman Player of the Year in 1986, First Team All Far West in 1989, and First Team All American in 1996. She was also a member of the gold medal Olympic winning soccer team in 1996, a member of the Womenâ€™s World Cup All Star team in 1999, and a member of the silver medal winning Olympic soccer team in 2000. == References == Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from California Category:Shiroki FC Serena players",
