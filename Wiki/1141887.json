 "text": "Florida Amendment 4 is a proposed change to the Florida Constitution that voters will decide on November 5, 2024. Voting \"yes\" on Florida Amendment 4 would make abortion legal until fetal viability (meaning any time before a fetus can live outside the womb), which is generally considered to be around 23–24 weeks. It would also permit abortions when it would be necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Voting \"no\" on Florida Amendment 4 would leave abortions illegal in Florida after 6 weeks unless two physicians are willing to state that the pregnant person would die without one. In order for the ballot measures to pass, at least 60% of voters must vote “yes” in November. == References == Category:Florida Legislature Category:2024 elections in the United States Category:U.S. abortion laws by state",
