 "text": "Peer-to-peer file sharing is the sharing and distribution of digital media using peer-to-peer networking technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access files, like movies, books, music and games using a P2P software program. There is an ongoing discussion related to the economic impact of P2P file sharing. The economic effect of copyright infringement under peer-to-peer file sharing on music has been controversial and hard to determine. Some unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on overall record sales. The United States' Motion Picture Association of America said that American studios lost just over $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005. That was about one third of the total cost of movie piracy in the United States. The estimate from the MPAA was doubted by commentators. It was based under the assumption that one download was the equivalent of one lost sale. Downloaders might not buy the movie if downloading was an option. ==References== Category:File sharing",
