 "text": "Roseanna's Grave (also known as For Roseanna) is a 1997 American romantic dramedy film directed by Paul Weiland. In his review, Roger Ebert concludes that Roseanna's Grave \"isn't of much consequence, perhaps, and the gears of the plot are occasionally visible as they turn. But it's a small, sweet film that never tries for more than it's sure of, and the actors find it such a relief to be playing such goodhearted characters that we can almost feel it.\" For Roseanna was the name given to the film in its festival release. ==Cast== * Jean Reno as Marcello * Mercedes Ruehl as Roseanna * Polly Walker as Cecilia * Mark Frankel as Antonio * Trevor Peacock as Fredo Iaccoponi * Fay Ripley as Francesca * George Rossi as Sergeant Baggio * Alfredo Varelli as Shop Owner (final film role) ==References== Category:1997 movies Category:American movies Category:Movies directed by Paul Weiland",
