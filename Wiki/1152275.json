 "text": "The Aakre Tarandkalme is an archaeological site in Estonia, where many important findings were made. This site, excavated in 2014 and 2015, contains human remains and artifacts dating from various periods, including the Roman Iron Age and the Viking Age. One of the most significant finds from this site were 14 sets of human remains, which included adults, children, and even a fetus. Researchers also uncovered many fragments of pottery, with different types of ceramics such as coarse and fine pottery, some decorated with textile patterns. These ceramics helped date the site to the Roman Iron Age, with Viking Age pottery found too. Additionally, about 70 objects were discovered, including jewelry such as spiral rings, bronze spirals, and a pin dating back to the 3rd century BCE. Some of these items might have been placed in the grave in a particular order, suggesting a ritualistic or organized burial practice. Category:Archaeological sites in Europe Category:Estonia",
