It's not really about things that have > actually happened to me. It's more about experience in general. I've heard a > lot of good ideas from people telling me what it's about. They said it's > about God, Satan, Jesus, Satan, both, it's religious, it isn't > religious...The truth is, it's just me. ==References== ==Other websites== *\"Room a Thousand Years Wide\" on YouTube Category:1990 songs Category:Soundgarden",
