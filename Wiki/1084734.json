 "text": "This is a list of wars that happened during the Prehistoric era. At that time, history was not documented. This has caused problems in figuring out what had happened during these times. Most prehistoric 'battles' are only known by their locations in a country; county; prefecture; district; etc. For example, Jebel Sahaba is a place in Northern Sudan, not the battle's name. And you can notice that on the list, the battles have a vast range of date. This is because archaeologists can't decide exactly when the battle took place. The DNA in the bones (if there are any) can only give an idea of which condition and in what era the remains were buried. So these battle sites are something like inaccurate graves. The two letters, B and C that appear after the numbers of the date mean, 'before Christ', or basically, when Christ (the son of god in Christianity) was born. Now many people, and the word BC, refers the year 0 to when Christ was born. Actually, Jesus is calculated to be born in about 6 to 4 BC, if 0 is still interpreted as 0.
