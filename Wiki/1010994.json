The adult male frog is about 38 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 44 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is brown in color with dark marks. People have seen this frog in forests with on hills. People see the frog in dry, rocky places where streams were that still have small pools of water. The tadpoles swim in water with dead leaves at the bottom. People have seen this frog between 163 and 500 meters above sea level. Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in a large place. This frog lives in protected parks: Phu Jong-Na Yoi National Park, Phu Sri Tan Wildlife Sanctuary, and Phu Pha Namtip Non-hunting Area. But it is in some danger because people cut down the forests where it lives to make farms, for example for palm oil. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
