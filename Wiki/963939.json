 "text": "The post-Soviet states are the 15 sovereign states that were union republics of the Soviet Union. They emerged from the Soviet Union after the dissolution in 1991. They are also known as the former Soviet Union (FSU), the former Soviet Republics and in Russia as the near abroad. Russia is the main de facto internationally recognized successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War. Ukraine has, by law, claimed that it is a state-successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Union which stayed under dispute over formerly Soviet-owned areas.On Legal Succession of Ukraine, Articles 7 and 8. The three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – were the first to declare their independence from the USSR, between March and May 1990. They claimed continuity from the original states which existed before the annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The remaining 12 republics all left after. All 12 of these republics joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and most of the 12 joining the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). However, the Baltic states focused on European Union (EU) and NATO membership. EU officials have made clear the importance of Association Agreements between the EU and post-Soviet states. Many disputed states with varying degrees of recognition exist within the territory of the former Soviet Union. These are Transnistria in eastern Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in northern Georgia and Artsakh in southwestern Azerbaijan. Since 2014, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in far eastern Ukraine have claimed independence. All of these unrecognized states except Artsakh depend on Russian armed support and financial aid. Artsakh is part of Armenia at a de facto level, which also maintains close cooperation with Russia. Before its annexation by Russia in March 2014, which was not recognized by most countries, Crimea shortly declared itself an independent state. == Country comparison == The 15 states may be divided into four subregions. Not included in these categories are the several de facto independent states presently lacking international recognition (read below: Separatist conflicts).

Similarly, the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders in 2022 recorded the following for press freedom: * Estonia — \"Good situation\" * Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova — \"Satisfactory situation\" * Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine — \"Problematic situation\" * Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan — \"Difficult situation\" * Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia, Turkmenistan — \"Very serious situation\" It has been said that several post-Soviet states did not change leadership for decades since their independence, such as Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan until his surprise resignation in 2019, and Islam Karimov in Uzbekistan, until his death in September 2016. All of these had originally more limited terms but through decrees or referendums prolonged their stay in office (a practice also followed by Presidents Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan). Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan had served as President since its independence until he was forced to resign as a result of the Kyrgyz revolution of 2005. Saparmurat Niyazov in Turkmenistan ruled from independence until his death in 2006, creating a personality cult around himself. His successor, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, has kept a personality cult of his own that has replaced the worshipping of Niyazov. The issue of dynastical succession has been another thing affecting the politics of some post-Soviet States. Heydar Aliyev, after creating an extensive and ongoing cult of personality, handed the Presidency of Azerbaijan to his son, Ilham Aliyev. Theories about the children of other leaders in Central Asia being groomed for succession abound. The participation of Akayev's son and daughter in the 2005 Kyrgyz parliamentary elections boosted fears of dynastic succession being used in Kyrgyzstan as well, and may have contributed to the anti-Akayev climate that led to his overthrow. === Separatist conflicts === Economic, political, national, military, and social problems have all been reasons of separatism in the post-Soviet era. In many cases, problems because of reasons such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open. Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been: ==== Current self-declared states ==== Region Region Country name Flag Capital Independence Recognition Area Area Population Density Density Region Region Country name Flag Capital Independence Recognition km2 mi2 Population p/km2 p/mi2 Eastern Europe Transnistria Tiraspol 25 August 1991 Not recognised 306,000 Donetsk Donetsk 12 May 2014 Limited 2,302,444 Luhansk Luhansk 12 May 2014 1,464,039 South Caucasus Artsakh Stepanakert 10 December 1991 Not recognised 150,932 South Ossetia Tskhinvali 21 December 1991 Limited 53,532 Abkhazia Sokhumi 23 July 1992 254,246 * , which is de facto independent from Moldova. It declared independence in 1990, because of its majority Russian-speaking population fearing union with Romania. A ceasefire between Transnistrian forces and Moldovan forces has been in place since 1992. * and , states which declared independence from Ukraine in 2014 and were recognized by Russia on 22 February 2022. They were formally annexed by Russia on 30 September 2022. * , which is de facto independent from Azerbaijan. Ethnic conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis began in 1988, and expanded into a war which lasted until a ceasefire in 1994. Attempts at negotiating a final peace and many bursts of violence have continued since then. * , which is de facto independent from Georgia. The region stated its goal to seek independence in 1990, leading to a conflict which led to a ceasefire in 1992. Separatism became powerful after the election of Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili in 2004, and a referendum in 2006 was in favour of declaring independence. The 2008 war between Georgian forces and the separatist and Russian forces led to Russia's recognition of South Ossetia's independence. * , which is de facto independent from Georgia. Tensions in the area broke out when Georgia sent in troops in 1992 to control groups who wanted separation. The troops and most of the Georgian and Mingrelian speaking population were forced out in 1993, and the region declared independence in 1999. The 2008 war between Georgian forces and the separatist and Russian forces led to Russia's recognition of Abkhazia's independence. ==== Former self-declared states ==== Region Region Country name Flag Capital Independence Fate Area Area Population Density Density Region Region Country name Flag Capital Independence Fate km2 mi2 Population p/km2 p/mi2 Eastern Europe Gagauzia Comrat 19 August 1990 134,132 Crimea Simferopol 17 March 2014 1,913,731 Central Asia Tatarstan Kazan 21 March 1992 3,786,488 South Caucasus Chechnya Grozny 8 June 1991 1,103,686 Talysh-Mughan Lankaran June 1993 960,000 * Gagauz Republic, declared itself the \"Gagauz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\" within Moldova on 12 November 1989, and the \"Gagauz Soviet Socialist Republic\", independent of Moldova but still within the Soviet Union, on 19 August 1990, but was reintegrated into Moldova as an autonomous region on 23 December 1994. * , declared itself to be a sovereign state after a referendum on 21 March 1992. Negotiations with Russia led to the signing of a treaty in 1994 which ended Tatarstan's de facto independence, but reserved significant autonomy for the Tatarstan government. In 2002 a new constitution was enacted for Tatarstan which removed the prior constitution's declaration that Tatarstan was a sovereign state. * . The entire Crimean Peninsula has been outside the control of Ukrainian authorities since late February 2014, when Russian special forces and pro-Russian militias occupied the region. In March 2014, a popular referendum in favor of accession to Russia was held in Crimea and Sevastopol, although Ukraine and most of the international community refused to recognize the vote. The next day, the Republic of Crimea declared independence, and within days Russia absorbed the peninsula. Ukraine continues to claim Crimea as an integral part of its territory. * Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, where Dzhokhar Dudayev declared independence from Russia in 1991, leading to a violent war between local separatist forces and the Russian army. Russia first invaded in 1994, withdrawing after a deal for increased autonomy was granted in 1996. Tensions have continued in the years since then, and the conflict has spilled over into neighbouring regions such as Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia–Alania. Russia claims that the situation in Chechnya has normalised. * Talysh-Mughan, declared independence from Azerbaijan, that lasted from June to August 1993. === Civil wars === Civil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region: * The Georgian Civil War between the forces of Zviad Gamsakhurdia and Eduard Shevardnadze. The war ended after Russian forces intervened in support of Shevardnadze's government, which in turn agreed to join the Commonwealth of Independent States. * The Tajikistani Civil War that lasted between 1992 and 1997. === Colour revolutions === Since 2003, a number of (largely) peaceful \"colour revolutions\" have happened in some post-Soviet states after disputed elections, with popular protests bringing into power the former opposition. * The Rose Revolution in Georgia, leading to the resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze. * The Orange Revolution in Ukraine, bringing into power Viktor Yushchenko and toppling the pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych. * The Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, leading to the resignation of Askar Akayev. * The Velvet Revolution in Armenia, leading to the resignation of Serzh Sargsyan. == Related articles == * Eastern Bloc == References == Category:1990s in the Soviet Union Category:Politics of the Soviet Union Category:Country classifications",
