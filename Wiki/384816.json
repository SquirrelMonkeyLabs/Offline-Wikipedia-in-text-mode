The trend spread with people trying to replicate the video. The videos feature the song Harlem Shake by electronic musician Baauer, and a dance.Inside Hoops Normally, each video begins with one person (often wearing a mask) dancing to the song alone, surrounded by other people who seem to be unaware of the person dancing. When the bass drops, the entire crowd starts doing the dance. The video tends to be 30 seconds long.
