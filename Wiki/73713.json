 "text": "The North Hollywood shootout was a gunfight that happened on February 28, 1997. Emil Matasareanu (July 19, 1966 - February 28, 1997) and Larry Eugene Phillips Jr. (September 20, 1970 - February 28, 1997) were bank robbers, and used AK-47s, an AR-15, an HK-91, and 9 MM pistols. The police could not easily kill them because of their heavy body armor, which was made out of kevlar. 20 people were wounded, and the only two killed were the robbers. Matasareanu was shot dead by police. Phillips shot himself in the head with a Beretta M92F as police shot him multiple times. His body was left in the street for about an hour before ambulances came to take his body away. ==Reference== Category:1997 in California Category:1990s crimes in California Category:1990s in Los Angeles, California Category:Robberies Category:Suicides by firearm in the United States Category:Suicides in California",
