 "text": "Dawson City is a place in Yukon. It used to be a city, but is not one anymore. It is the second-largest place in Yukon, after Whitehorse, and has 1,577 people. Dawson was at its biggest during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, and served as a base for mining. Many people became rich not from finding gold, but from running boarding houses/general stores because of good business from all of the miners. It was the capital of Yukon from 1898 to 1952.
