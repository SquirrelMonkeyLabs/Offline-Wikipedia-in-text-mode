 "text": "Kordylewski clouds are clumps of dust located at 2 out of the 5 special points in space between the Earth and the Moon. The 2 special points are called L4 and L5 Lagrange points. They were discovered by a Polish astronomer in the 1960s, and recently confirmed by the Royal Astronomical Society in October 2018. == Discovery and observation == Kordylewski searched for clouds of dust at the Lagrange points in 1951. He first saw them in 1956. He then succeeded in photographing two bright patches near the L5 Lagrange point in between 6 March 1961 to 6 April 1961. J. Wesley Simpson observed the clouds in 1967 using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, and in 2018, the Royal Astronomical Society confirmed their existence. However, the Japanese Hiten space probe did not find the clouds in 1992, although this does not mean they are not there. == References == Category:Solar System",
