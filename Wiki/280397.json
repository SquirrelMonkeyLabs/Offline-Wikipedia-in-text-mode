 "text": "Kenneth Wregget (born March 25, 1964) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender. He won the Stanley Cup in 1992 with the Pittsburgh Penguins. ==Playing career== He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, Calgary Flames, and Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League from 1983 through 2000. He played one season for the Manitoba Moose of the International Hockey League in 2000–2001 before retiring at the age of 37. Wregget played for three seasons with the Lethbridge Broncos of the Western Hockey League and won the Del Wilson Trophy as the WHL's top goaltender in 1984. In 1983, he joined the St. Catharines Saints, the Toronto AHL affiliate, after being drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the third round of the 1982 NHL Entry Draft, 45th overall. He split time for two seasons between St. Catharines and the Maple Leafs. The 1986–87 season was his first full year in the NHL. In 1992, he was traded from the Philadelphia Flyers to the reigning champion Pittsburgh Penguins along with Kjell Samuelsson and Rick Tocchet in exchange for Mark Recchi. Wregget was generally backup to Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso, although Wregget was regarded as a solid goaltender in his own right. There was frequent speculation that Wregget would take over as the starting goaltender. Wregget's best season came in 1994–95 when he played in 38 games and compiled a 25–9-2 record with a 3.21 goals against average and a .903 save percentage while also leading the NHL in wins. He was also the goaltender who faced the first penalty shot ever awarded during an overtime period in NHL playoff history (1996). He stopped Washington Capitals star Joé Juneau, extending what was the third-longest game in NHL history, the longest game since 1936. The Penguins finally won 3–2 in the fourth overtime period. In 2009, he was inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season=== Season Team League GP W L T MIN GA SO GAA SV% 1981–82 Lethbridge Broncos WHL 36 19 12 0 1713 118 1 4.13 1982–83 Lethbridge Broncos WHL 48 26 17 1 2696 157 1 3.49 1983–84 Lethbridge Broncos WHL 53 32 20 0 3053 161 0 3.16 1983–84 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 3 1 1 1 165 14 0 5.09 .891 1984–85 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 23 2 15 3 1278 103 0 4.84 .863 1984–85 St. Catharines Saints AHL 12 2 8 1 688 48 0 4.19 1985–86 St. Catharines Saints AHL 18 8 9 0 1058 78 1 4.42 1985–86 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 30 9 13 4 1566 113 0 4.33 .875 1986–87 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 56 22 28 3 3026 200 0 3.97 .875 1987–88 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 56 12 35 4 3000 222 2 4.44 .870 1988–89 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 32 9 20 2 1888 139 0 4.42 .866 1988–89 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 3 1 1 0 130 13 0 6.00 .822 1989–90 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 51 22 24 3 2961 169 0 3.42 .892 1990–91 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 30 10 14 3 1484 88 0 3.56 .867 1991–92 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 23 9 8 3 1259 75 0 3.57 .865 1991–92 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 9 5 3 0 448 31 0 4.15 .847 1992–93 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 25 13 7 2 1368 78 0 3.42 .887 1993–94 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 42 21 12 7 2456 138 1 3.37 .893 1994–95 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 38 25 9 2 2208 118 0 3.21 .903 1995–96 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 37 20 13 2 2132 115 3 3.24 .905 1996–97 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 46 17 17 6 2514 136 2 3.25 .902 1997–98 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 15 3 6 2 611 28 0 2.75 .904 1998–99 Calgary Flames NHL 27 10 12 4 1590 67 1 2.53 .906 1999–00 Detroit Red Wings NHL 29 14 10 2 1579 70 0 2.66 .900 2000–01 Manitoba Moose IHL 30 11 13 4 1602 72 2 2.70 .900 NHL totals NHL totals NHL totals 575 225 248 53 31663 1917 9 3.63 .885 ===Post season=== Season Team League GP W L MIN GA SO GAA SV% 1981–82 Lethbridge Broncos WHL 3 84 3 0 2.14 1982–83 Lethbridge Broncos WHL 20 14 5 1154 58 1 3.02 1983–84 Lethbridge Broncos WHL 4 1 3 210 18 0 5.14 1985–86 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 10 6 4 607 32 1 3.16 .901 1986–87 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 13 7 6 761 29 1 2.29 .921 1987–88 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 2 0 1 108 11 0 6.11 .823 1988–89 Philadelphia Flyers NHL 5 2 2 268 10 0 2.24 .928 1991–92 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 1 0 0 40 4 0 6.00 .750 1994–95 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 11 5 6 661 33 1 3.00 .905 1995–96 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 9 7 2 598 23 0 2.31 .930 1996–97 Pittsburgh Penguins NHL 5 1 4 297 18 0 3.64 .915 2000–01 Manitoba Moose IHL 12 6 5 0 2.33 NHL totals NHL totals NHL totals 56 28 25 3340 160 3 2.87 .911 ==References== ==Other websites== * * * * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Calgary Flames players Category:Canadian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Ice hockey people from Brandon, Manitoba Category:Lethbridge Broncos players Category:Philadelphia Flyers players Category:Pittsburgh Penguins players Category:St. Catharines Saints players Category:Stanley Cup champions Category:Toronto Maple Leafs players Category:International Hockey League (1945–2001) players",
