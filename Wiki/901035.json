 "text": "The Cambridgeshire Guided Busway, known locally as The Busway, connects Cambridge, Huntingdon and St Ives. It is in the English county of Cambridgeshire. It is the longest guided busway in the world, beating the O-Bahn Busway in Adelaide, South Australia. Two guided sections make up of the route. The northern section uses the course of the old Cambridge and Huntingdon railway and it runs through the former stations of , and . The southern section uses some of the former Varsity Line to Oxford. It links Cambridge railway station, Addenbrooke's Hospital and the park and ride site at Trumpington, via housing on the Clay Farm site. Services are ran by Stagecoach in Huntingdonshire and Whippet. These two companies are the only two that run services on the Busway. However, they had to run a regular service between 07:00 and 19:00 every day for exclusive rights to the Busway. == References == Category:Bus transport in the United Kingdom Category:Cambridgeshire",
