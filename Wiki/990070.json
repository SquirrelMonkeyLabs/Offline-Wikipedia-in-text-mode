 "text": "Ariane 6 is a European expendable launch system. In 2023, it was being developed. It has been in development since the early 2010s by ArianeGroup. They were creating it for the European Space Agency (ESA). The system was being built to replace the Ariane 5. The stated reason for Ariane 6 was that is was half the cost of Ariane 5. The new system would also increase the maximum number of launches each year from six or seven to up to eleven. Ariane 6 is designed with two core stages. They are both powered by liquid hydrogen- liquid oxygen (hydrolox) engines. The first stage has a version of the Vulcain engine that is used on the Ariane 5. The second stage has a new design of the Vinci engine. Most of the lift-off thrust comes from solid rocket boosters attached to the first stage. There are two P120s on the Ariane 62 and four on the Ariane 64 variants. These are larger versions of the P80s used on the Vega rocket. == Description == Two versions of Ariane 6 are being created: * Ariane 62 has two P120 solid boosters. It will weigh about at liftoff. This version is intended for government and scientific missions. It can launch up to into Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) and into LEO. * Ariane 64 has four P120 boosters. It has a liftoff weight of about . This version is intended for commercial satellite launches. It can launch up to into GTO and into LEO. Like Ariane 5, it will be able to launch two geosynchronous satellites together. ==References== Category:Spacecraft",
