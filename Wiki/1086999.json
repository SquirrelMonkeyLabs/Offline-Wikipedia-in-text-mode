 "text": "The northern tree frog, Burmese whipping frog, vacal sacless tree frog, Smith's striped tree frog, or upland tree frog (Polypedates mutus) is a frog. It lives in Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Laos, and India. People have seen it between 500 and 1100 meters above sea level. This frog lives in and near forests. The female frog lays eggs in water that does not move: rice paddies, marshes, and ponds. Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place, but they believe people cutting down its forests may harm it. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
