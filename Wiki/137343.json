The album was to be called Bryan Adams Hasn't Heard Of You Either but the record company wanted him to change the title to something safer. The first single, \"Lonely Nights\", was a big hit in the US. Two other singles \"Coming Home\" and \"Fits Ya Good\" were top 40 hits in Canada. Many songs from this album were covered by other artists, they are \"Lonely Nights\" by Uriah Heep, \"Jealousy\" by Prism, \"Tonight\" by Randy Meisner and \"Fits Ya Good\" by Tove Naess and others.
