 "text": "In the U.S., police use of deadly force is a major and controversial issue. In 2022, police shot and killed 1,096 people, according to The Washington Post, while the Mapping Police Violence (MPV) project reported a total of 1,176 deaths. MPV recorded 1,213 police-related deaths in 2023. It's hard to draw clear conclusions about race and policing because reliable data is lacking. To help with this, some non-government groups have started collecting their own data. Research shows mixed results—some studies find racial bias in police killings, while others do not. One study found that about 1 in 2,000 men and 1 in 33,000 women may be killed by police in their lifetime. Black men face the highest risk—about 1 in 1,000. Black, Hispanic, and Native American/Alaskan people are killed by police at higher rates than White or Asian people. ==References== Category:Law enforcement in the United States",
