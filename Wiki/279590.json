There is, however, occasional confusion with similarly named actress Vanessa A. Williams, who is just two months younger. It has been reported that Williams first became aware of Vanessa A. in the 1980s when her New York University registrar told her that another, similarly aged student with the same name and from the same state had applied.Hobson, Louis B. (August 16, 1998), \"Vanessa dancing up a storm\", Canoe.ca\"Vanessa Williams: Boomtown's new Bombshell!\" . TV Guide. September 2, 2003. When Williams appeared as Miss America in a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Vanessa A. accidentally received her check for the appearance, which she returned. The two ran into name conflict when Screen Actors Guild rules stopped the same stage naming. Vanessa A. had registered the name \"Vanessa Williams\" first. As a compromise, Williams was occasionally credited as \"Vanessa L. Williams\" in acting credits. Both actresses starred in versions of the drama Soul Food (Williams in the film version, and Vanessa A. in its Soul Food adaptation). The Screen Actors Guild eventually took the issue to arbitration, and decided that both actresses could use the professional name \"Vanessa Williams\". Today, Williams' prominence has led to a more wide association with the stage name \"Vanessa Williams\", so much so that it has widely become only known to her. She is credited as such in the American television series Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives. Williams is also the owner of the internet domain name vanessawilliams.com. Today, the younger Vanessa Williams is most often publicly and professionally referenced as \"Vanessa A. Williams\". ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:African-American musicians Category:American movie actors Category:American stage actors Category:American television actors Category:American voice actors Category:American pop musicians Category:American R&B; singers Category:Singers from New York (state) Category:Actors from New York (state) Category:Miss America winners",
