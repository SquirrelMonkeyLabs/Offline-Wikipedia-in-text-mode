 "text": "Landau's problems are four basic problems about prime numbers. They were listed at the 1912 International Congress of Mathematicians and presented by Edmund Landau. ==Problems== These problems were presented in his speech as \"unattackable at the present state of mathematics\". They are as follows: # Goldbach's conjecture: Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes? # Twin prime conjecture: Are there infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is prime? # Legendre's conjecture: Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive perfect squares? # Are there infinitely many primes p such that p âˆ’ 1 is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form n2 \\+ 1? As of August 2022, all four problems are unresolved. == References == Category:Mathematical problems",
