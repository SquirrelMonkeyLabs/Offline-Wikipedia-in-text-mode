 "text": "Agostino Carracci (sometimes also spelled Agostino Caracci, 16 August 1557 â€“ 22 March 1602) was an Italian painter and printmaker. His brother Annibale and cousin Lodovico Carracci were more famous than he was. He thought nature was an ideal. He founded a school that was competing with that of Caravaggio. Together with his brothers, he founded the Accademia degli Incamminati. The academy helped painters of the School of Bologna to become famous. ==Related pages== * List of Italian painters ==Other websites== *Catholic Encyclopedia: Carracci Category:1557 births Category:1602 deaths Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Printmakers",
