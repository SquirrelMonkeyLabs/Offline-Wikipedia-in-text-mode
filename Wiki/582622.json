He was the son of Donald II of Scotland and Sigurda Mac Causantin. He succeded his first cousin once removed, Constantine II, who succeded Malcolm's father. == Birth == Malcolm was born between 896 and 900 somewhere in Scotland. The place and exact time of his birth is unclear like many of the monarchs before him. == Reign == His reign began in 943, 100 years after Kenneth I. His reign lasted 11 years until 954. During his reign he married Bethoc. They had two children, Dub (later to be king) and Kenneth III (also to be king). He also may have had a child named Mogallus mac Malcolm, prince of Scots in 934, before becoming king. == Death == Malcolm died in 954. The throne went to Indulf, and later to his two sons Kenneth and Dub. After his death, many monarchs would take his name as king of Alba \"Rex Alban\" making him \"according to some sources\" the first king of Alba, instead of Constantine II.
