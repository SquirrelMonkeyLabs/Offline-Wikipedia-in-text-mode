It’s another sing-a-long, small town love type of song but does that matter at this point, it’s a song that’s all about feeling good with people you love to be with.\"[1] ==Music video== The music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld and premiered in March 2014. ==Chart performance== Chart (2014) Peak position ==References== Category:2014 songs",
