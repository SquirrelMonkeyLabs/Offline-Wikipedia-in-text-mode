He decides to take his film festival to South Park instead. He plans to ruin South Park too and then move on to the next mountain town. Many film watchers come to South Park for the festival. The magical piece of feces, Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo tells Kyle that the newcomers are killing him. This is because their waste comes from healthy food and not the unhealthy food that South Park residents eat. Kyle tries to warn people about this, but no one believes him. Mr. Hanky almost dies, but he is saved by eating Chef's chocolate candy. Mr. Hanky gives a speech about the true meaning of film festivals: People watching unusual movies together. The evil organizer almost drowns in sewage. ==Critical reception== Phil Dyess- Nugent of The AV Club says that this episode made fun of what the Sundance Film Festival was like in the late 1990s. He says the film festival organizer is meant to be Robert Redford. ==References== ==Other websites== *IMDB Category:1998 television episodes Category:South Park (season 2) episodes",
