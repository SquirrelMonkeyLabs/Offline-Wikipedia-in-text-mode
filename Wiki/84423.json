 "text": "The Federal Ministry of Work and Social Affairs (BMAS) is a ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany . It was part of the Federal Ministry of economy and work () between 2002 and 2005. ==Office building== A part of the ministry is based in Berlin-Mitte. When the Bundestag and government moved to Berlin in 1999 the BMA moved into buildings in the Jägerstraße/ Wilhelmstraße. A large part of the ministry stayed in Bonn. Originally the building at Wilhelmstraße 49 was a stately home. After 1826 it was used by the Hohenzollern Prince Karl. The building housed the press department of the Reichsregierung (National government) of the Weimar Republic between 1918 and 1933. Under the Third Reich it was the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda of Dr Joseph Goebbels. After Wartime damage was repaired, the Central Council of the National Front moved in 1947. Later the Central Council of the German Democratic Republic occupied the building. The study of the first and only president of the DDR, Wilhelm Pieck, is there. It was restored between 1996 and 2000. ==Federal ministers== ===Federal Minister for Work 1949 to 1957=== 1949-1957: Anton Storch (CDU) ===Federal Minister for Work and Social Affairs 1957 to 2007=== * 1957-1965: Theodor Blank (CDU) * 1965-1969: Hans Katzer (CDU) * 1969-1976: Walter Arendt (SPD) * 1976-1982: Herbert Ehrenberg (SPD) * 1982-1982: Heinz Westphal (SPD) * 1982-1998: Norbert Blüm (CDU) * 1998-2002: Walter Riester (SPD) ** 2002-2005: Wolfgang Clement (SPD) Minister for Economy and Labour ** 2002-2005: Ulla Schmidt (SPD) Minister for Health and Social Security * 2005-2007: Franz Müntefering (SPD) * 2007-2009: Olaf Scholz (SPD) * 2009: Franz Josef Jung (CDU) * 2009-2013: Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) * 2013-2017: Andrea Nahles (SPD) * 2017-2018: Katarina Barley, (SPD) * 2018-: Hubertus Heil, (SPD) == Functions == The BMAS was involved in promoting the new Code of Social Law II, sometimes called Hartz IV.
