 "text": "Harvey Murray Glatman (December 10, 1927 â€“ September 18, 1959) was an American serial killer active during the late 1950s. He was known in the media as \"The Lonely Hearts Killer\" and \"The Glamour Girl Slayer\". He would use several pseudonyms, posing as a professional photographer to lure his victims with the promise of a modelling career. Glatman was later found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder by California and sentenced to death, a sentence that he accepted willingly. He specifically asked the warden to do nothing to save his life. He was executed in the gas chamber of San Quentin State Prison on September 18, 1959. ==Related pages== *Pee Wee Gaskins Category:1927 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Jewish American criminals Category:Executed American serial killers Category:American rapists Category:American kidnappers Category:People from the Bronx",
