 "text": "The Polynesian languages are a group of languages spoken in Oceania. They all belong in the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages. They are mostly spoken in Polynesia, but some are spoken in nearby Melanesia and Micronesia. There are around 30-40 Polynesian languages, with Samoan having the most speakers. Other well-known Polynesian languages include M훮ori, Tongan, Hawaiian and Tahitian. == History == The Polynesian languages formed when Austronesians in New Caledonia (the Lapita culture) started moving to other parts of Oceania. Navigation of Oceania continued until 1300AD, with the discovery of New Zealand (Aotearoa) by the M훮ori people. Today, there are over 2 million Polynesians, although speakers of Polynesian languages number far less due to historical reasons such as disease and colonialism. == Immigrant populations == Language Number of speakers in Australia Number of speakers in New Zealand Cook Islands M훮ori 5,119 7,725 M훮ori 11,746 50,000 fluent 149,000 with some knowledge Niuean 253 5,400 Samoan 44,875 86,403 Tokelauan 956 1,144 (mainland), 1,400 (Tokelau) Tongan 17,694 31,839 == Sound changes == Throughout the Polynesian languages, many sound changes occur.
