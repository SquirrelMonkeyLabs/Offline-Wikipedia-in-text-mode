Apart from the main pub, it has a beer garden. There are drawings and words made by people in the army from World War II in the ceilings and walls. On February 28, 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson discovered \"the secret of life\" in The Eagle: they had come up with their proposal for the structure of DNA. Today the pub serves a beer to remember this discovery, named Eagle's DNA. Category:Pubs Category:Organisations based in Cambridge",
