It is located about one kilometer away from Kotwali Gate and half a kilometre from Choto Sona Mosque. The mosque was built by a sultan named Shamsuddin Yusuf Shah, son of Barbak Shah. It is made of bricks, but the pillars are made of stone. It used to have a roof with 24 domes and 4 chachalaca vaults, but now they have all fallen down. The mosque is 34 meters long and 20.6 meters wide on the outside, 30.3 meters long and 11.7 meters wide on the inside. The prayer room is accessed from the east through seven pointed-arch openings from the verandah. There are also three pointed archways on the southern wall and two on the northern wall. Inside the prayer chamber, there are the remains of a royal gallery to its northwest corner. The qiblah wall has eleven mihrabs, two of which belong to the royal gallery at the upper level. The mosque used to have terracotta plaques that were decorated, but some of them have disappeared over time. The architecture of this mosque is known as Bengali Sultanate Architecture, which is a combination of local and Sultanate styles. It represents the people, land, air, and water of the region. The Sultanate style was used by the Sultans who ruled Bengal for a long time. This style is famous for making mosques and tombs in Bangladesh. ==Reference== Category:Mosques in Bangladesh Category:15th-century buildings and structures",
