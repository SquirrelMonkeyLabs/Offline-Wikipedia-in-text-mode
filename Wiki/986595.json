 "text": "The Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame began in 2013. It is a group of very good writers who have strong connections to the state of Kentucky. To become a member a writer needs to have published works deemed to be of lasting importance. The selected writers do not need to be born in Kentucky, but they should have a special relation to the state. A person can be suggested for the Hall of Fame by anyone. Final decisions are made by a committee of the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning and the Kentucky Arts Council. For the first two years of the group, new members were all deceased. But in 2015, Wendell Berry became the first living member to be included. Other living members have been added since then. Other members of the Hall of Fame include Robert Penn Warren, Thomas Merton, Jean Ritchie, Hunter S. Thompson, Harlan Hubbard, bell hooks, Sam Shepard, and Barbara Kingsolver. == References == Category:American awards Category:Halls of fame Category:Literary awards",
