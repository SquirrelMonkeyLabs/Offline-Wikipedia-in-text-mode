 "text": "The Great Flood of 1993 was a major natural disaster. It affected nine states, mostly between April and September 1993. It involved the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Storms with heavy rain began hitting the same locations over and over again. This pattern began repeating in late April and early May. It lasted until September in some areas. Eastern Iowa, Missouri and Illinois were especially hard-hit. The flood was the costliest in the history of the United States. Damage totaled $15 billion, although some estimates go as high as $20 billion. There were thirty-two deaths because of the flood. Some estimates put the death toll at 50. ==References== Category:1993 in the United States Category:Severe weather Category:Floods in the United States Category:1990s floods Category:1990s in Illinois Category:20th century in Iowa Category:20th century in Kansas Category:1990s in Minnesota Category:1990s in Missouri Category:20th century in Nebraska Category:20th century in North Dakota Category:History of South Dakota Category:20th century in Wisconsin Category:1993 disasters",
