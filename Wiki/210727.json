Behind Euwe is Milan Vidmar, the Slovenian electrical engineer and grandmaster; the young man in a dark suit is Salo Flohr from Czechoslovakia, a world-class player at the time. The figure on the right is unclear; it might be Alekhine. Machgielis \"Max\" Euwe Pronounced like the British pronunciation of fervour without the f.

The Professor: Max Euwe. In The reliable past. New in Chess.p132 Against all expectations, Max won the world chess championship in a match with Alexander Alekhine in 1935. Alekhine won the title back in a rematch two years later. After World War II, Euwe was still the best player in western Europe, and played in two world championship candidates tournaments. Max played for the world championship in 1948, in the match-tournament which decided the successor to Alekhine. He finished below Botvinnik, Smyslov, Keres and Reshevsky. Again he tried, at the Candidates' tournament in 1953, but this was also unsuccessful, though he was still a strong player. Max used his teaching skills in chess as well as mathematics. He wrote 20 chess books, most aimed at helping the club player improve. He invented a subscription correspondence course called The Chess Archives, but known everywhere as Euwe's Archives. This gave teaching on chess openings, which were then an area of great weakness for club players. The Archives were published in Dutch, German and English, and helped to give professional help to amateur players. Euwe served as President of FIDE, the World Chess Federation, from 1970 to 1978. He tried to expand chess into more countries, a goal which has succeeded. == Related pages == * List of World Chess Champions == References == Category:1901 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Dutch academics Category:Dutch chess players Category:Dutch computer scientists Category:Dutch mathematicians Category:Sportspeople from Amsterdam",
