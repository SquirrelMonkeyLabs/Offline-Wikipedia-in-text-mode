The gold dice has the numbers 1 – 6, the silver dice has the numbers 1 – 3, the bronze dice has the numbers 1 – 2 while the normal dice has the numbers 1 – 6. After the mini- game, the winner starts first. Then it is the turn of the second place. Place 3 plays as third one and the loser as last one. The objective of the game is to reach the mountaintop first. On the way to the goal, there are many happening spaces which makes it harder or easier to win. After each player rolled the dice(s) a mini-game appears. Globe Trot The players go on a journey around the world. But in contrast to the other game the player has to take card to move. He can go 1,2 or 3 spaces. Each player gets 10 coins in the beginning, an Easter egg from the Mario Party series.The object is to reach special points on the globe (as example: Buy a fan in Japan or eat a Hamburger in the USA.)The visiting of a point costs 10 coins. With any visiting the player collects photos. The player who has the most at the end wins. Bingo A game that makes always fun while playing. As a parody to the famous gambling Bingo. Each player chooses a card with Mii's faces on it. Then the game begins. A huge bingo machine drops balls in every round. The balls show Mii's faces.
