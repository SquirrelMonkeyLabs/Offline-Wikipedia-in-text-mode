Andrey Shishkin, 2015 Other names Числобог Venerated in Ynglism Chislobog (Числобог) is a figure from modern Slavic paganism, especially in the Ynglist tradition. He is typically associated with time and/or numbers, and his name comes from the Slavic words for \"number\" (число, chislo) and \"god\" (бог, bog). Chislobog's origins are uncertain, but he appears in the Book of Veles, a book that is believed to be a forgery rather than a genuine ancient Slavic text. Despite this, he is an important figure in Ynglism and is worshipped by followers of the tradition. According to Ynglist belief, Chislobog controls the flow of time, sometimes symbolized as a river. He is also considered the protector of various Slavic-Aryan calendars, including the Daa'ri calendar. Ynglists believe that the Daa'ri calendar was used in Europe prior to the adoption of the Christian calendar. Chislobog is often depicted holding a sword in his left hand, symbolizing protection and preservation, and a shield with the Daa'ri calendar inscribed on it in his right hand. The hymn of Chislobog praises him as the protector of life and the giver of understanding to humans, and asks for blessings for Ynglist families and long life. While some people have suggested that Chislobog may be female, this is not a widely held belief among Ynglists. == Related pages == * Alexander Asov * Other pseudodeities ** Chernobog and Belobog ** Lada (mythology) == Notes == == References == Category:Time and fate gods Category:Slavic pseudo-deities",
