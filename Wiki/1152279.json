 "text": "The Benty Grange helmet is a famous Anglo-Saxon artifact discovered in 1848 at Benty Grange, near the town of Glossop, in Derbyshire, England. It is a distinctive helmet made of iron, with a large nose guard and a faceplate. It was made by covering an iron frame with horn. This helmet is thought to have been used by an Anglo-Saxon warrior during the early 7th century. What makes this helmet particularly special is its decoration. It features intricate designs and animal motifs, including a pair of animal heads on the sides, believed to represent mythical creatures. The helmet is thought to be part of a larger burial site and is linked to the period of King Raedwald of East Anglia, one of the most important rulers of early England. Today, the Benty Grange helmet is recognized as one of the finest examples of Anglo-Saxon metalwork. Though the helmet was originally thought to be much older, its true age has been studied and confirmed to be from the 7th century, during a time when the Anglo-Saxons were still developing their distinctive culture. The helmet is now housed in the British Museum and continues to be an important piece of England's early history. == References == ==Bibliography== * Category:Anglo-Saxons Category:Archaeological sites in England Category:Armour Category:Helmets",
