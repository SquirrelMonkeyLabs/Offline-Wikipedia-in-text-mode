 "text": "German Jews are Jews of German descent, or Jews living in Germany. ==Overview== Jews started living in German land in 321 AD under the Roman Empire. They formed the Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews (Hebrew: יהדות אשכנז) in the Middle Ages, * * * * * * * * who survived centuries of pogroms * * * * * * * * * * and expulsions into the 20th century. Multiple German cities were centers of Jewish cultural life, including Mainz and Speyer, until the Nazi German-led Holocaust happened and wiped out most German Jews, * * * * * * * * * * * among the 6,000,000 Jews killed across Europe. ==Middle Ages== Under the Germanic Frankish Merovingian dynasty between the 5th and 8th century, Jews were banned from working as public servants. * * * * * A succession of ecumenical councils also banned Jews from socializing with Christians or observing the shabbat over the unfounded fear that Judaism (the Jewish ethnoreligion) would influence Christians. ===11th century=== Systematic persecutions of Jews intensified in the 11th century under the Capetian dynasty, when King Robert the Pious tried to kill all Jews who rejected Christian conversion. Jews across the German land were assaulted, tortured or burned at stakes. The persecutions coincided with the destruction of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009, which was exploited by Benedictine monk Rodulfus Glaber to spread rumors about Jewish \"involvement\" in the destruction. ====First Crusade==== When the First Crusade happened in 1096, Jews were massacred by the crusaders across the German land. The events were seen by some historians as a series of genocidal massacres. * * * * * The massacres all happened with Roman Catholic Church's tacit approval. Between the 1182 and 1394, at least 13 expulsions of Jews happened, during which dozens of Black Death-associated massacres of Jews happened. ==Renaissance== Martin Luther (1483–1546), a reformer who led the Reformation in the 16th century, was well-known for his antisemitism, despite his historical contributions to Christianity and important role in European history. * Halpérin, Jean, and Arne Sovik, eds.

Geneva: LWF, 1984. * Oberman, Heiko A. The Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Age of Renaissance and Reformation. James I. Porter, trans. Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1984. . * Tjernagel, Neelak S. Martin Luther and the Jewish People. Milwaukee: Northwestern Publishing House, 1985. . * Wallmann, Johannes. \"The Reception of Luther's Writings on the Jews from the Reformation to the End of the 19th Century.\" Lutheran Quarterly 1 (Spring 1987) 1:72–97. * * Gritsch, Eric W. Martin Luther's Anti-Semitism: Against His Better Judgement. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2012. . Luther wrote the 65,000-word thesis On the Jews and Their Lies in 1543, consisting of accusations of \"Jewish conspiracy against Christianity\" and incitement to extreme violence towards Jews. Luther's antisemitism is said by historians to have contributed significantly to antisemitism in German society, while the claims in Luther's 16th-century book are still being promoted by some influencers. Johannes Wallman (1930–2021), a professor of church history at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, wrote in 1987: Richard Steigmann-Gall, a history professor at Kent State University, wrote in his 2003 book The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945:Richard Steigmann-Gall, The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p.138. ==Modern period== Between the Middle Ages and the 18th century, Jews in Germany suffered from persecutions punctuated by periods of tolerance. * * * The 19th century saw a series of anti-Jewish pogroms, emancipation of Jews followed in 1848. ===20th century=== By the early 20th century, German Jews were highly integrated compared to Jews in other European countries. The situation changed in the 1930s when the Nazis took over and started the Holocaust. 170,000 German Jews were killed in the camps during the Holocaust.The Jews of Germany: A Historical Portrait - Page 281 by Ruth \"Gay During the Holocaust, Martin Luther (1483–1546) was advertised as a folk hero in Nazi Germany, whose teachings were widely circulated among the public. Luther's statues were also built across Nazi Germany, along with regular celebrations of \"German Luther Day\", a national holiday designated by Hitler in 1933. ===21st century=== Jews exist in Germany at a much smaller number than before. In 2023, it is estimated that 118,000 Jews remained in Germany. Jews in Germany continue to be subject to antisemitic violence. ====2010s==== A 2017 Bielefeld University's research reported that those identified with the far left and far right committed roughly the same proportion of antisemitic hate crimes, with most perpetrators found to be individuals of Muslim background. The research was echoed by Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which asserted that certain Islamist groups' antisemitic rhetoric significantly challenged Germany's peaceful and tolerant society. In a follow-up EU research in 2018, 41% of antisemitic attacks were found to have been committed by Islamic extremists, 20% by those identified with the far right and 16% by the far left. ====2020s==== On October 18, 2023, 11 days following the Hamas-led October 7 massacre which killed over 1,200 in a day, a Berlin synagogue was firebombed with molotov cocktails by two masked men. * * Official statistics also showed a rapid rise in antisemitic hate crimes in the months following the October 7 massacre. * * * * On February 2, 2024, a pro-Palestinian Berlin undergraduate beat a Jewish classmate to the point of hospitalization following an argument over the Israel–Hamas war. The German police reported that the Jewish student was punched and kicked repeatedly on the floor, suffering facial fractures. The victim is the grandson of Amitzur Shapira, an Israeli athletics coach murdered by the Black September terrorists in the 1972 Munich massacre. In May 2024, some Jewish parents from suburban Berlin transferred their kids to Jewish schools in Mitte, many of which guarded by police and enclosed walls, due to increasing antisemitic violence in Berlin. In June 2024, a young Israeli couple was assaulted in Berlin's Potsdamer Platz after being heard speaking Hebrew. The suspect shouted abuses, threw a bottle and a chair at them and beat them on the floor. On September 5, 2024, the 52nd anniversary of the 1972 Munich massacre, a suspected terrorist opened fire at the Israeli consulate and the neighboring Munich Documentation Centre for the History of National Socialism before being shot dead by police. * * * On 7 October 2024, 10 Holocaust memorial stones were torn from their spots. The day coincided with the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre. In February 2025, a Jewish student at the Goethe University in Frankfurt has reportedly become a target of a hate campaign that resulted in physical injuries and death threats, including anonymous messages saying \"Inshallah, you will be shot…You should die…Your whole f***ing Israel…\" The victim reportedly filed over 60 police reports, which merely resulted in some of her harassers being fined for €300. Some of the harassers are reportedly associated with pro-Palestinian protests' organizers, with little to no condemnation from other left-wing activists. ====Responses==== In June 2024, the Federal Association of Departments for Research and Information on Antisemitism (RIAS) reported that there were 4,782 antisemitic incidents in 2023, an 80% rise as compared to 2022, most of which happened following the October 7 massacre. In October 2024, Felix Klein, the German Commissioner for Jewish Life and the Fight against Antisemitism, asserted that \"open and aggressive antisemitism has been stronger than at any time since 1945.\" On November 6, 2024, the German lower house of parliament passed a non-binding resolution to pledge the end of funding to groups that \"spread antisemitism, question Israel's right to exist, call for a boycott of Israel or actively support the BDS movement.\" The resolution enjoyed cross- party support, but faced opposition from MPs of left-wing populist parties like the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and Die Linke (Left Party), while the BDS movement itself was designated as antisemitic by the German government in 2019 and a threat of \"suspected extremism\" by the German intelligence agency in 2024. On May 20, 2025, the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution called the BDS \"hostile to the constitution\". In its report, it stated: ==Historical population== Year Jewish population in Germany Total German population Jewish % of population 1871 512,158 40,997,000 1.25% 1880 562,612 45,095,000 1.25% 1890 567,884 49,239,000 1.15% 1900 586,833 56,046,000 1.05% 1910 615,021 64,568,000 0.95% 1925 564,379 63,110,000 0.89% 1933 503,000 66,027,000 0.76% 1939 234,000 69,314,000 0.34% 1941 164,000 70,244,000 0.23% 1950 37,000 68,374,000 0.05% 1990 30,000 79,753,227 0.04% 1995 60,000 81,817,499 0.07% 2002 100,000 82,536,680 0.12% 2011 119,000 80,233,100 0.15% ==Related pages== * Antisemitism in Europe * Secondary antisemitism * Anti- Judaism and antisemitism * Antisemitism in the Soviet Union ==References== Category:Jewish communities Category:Jewish ethnic groups Category:Ethnic groups in Germany",
