 "text": "The darkroom is a room where photographic film and paper is handled and developed. It is kept dark to prevent undeveloped film or paper from being exposed to light, which would erase the image. Darkrooms that are used for handling orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) film and black and white paper can be illuminated with a red or yellow safelight. Darkrooms used for handling color film and paper, and panchromatic black and white film (films sensitive to all colors) must be kept completely dark. Category:Photography",
