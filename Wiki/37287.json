 "text": "The FIBA Basketball World Cup, known as the FIBA World Championship from 1950 through 2010, is a world basketball tournament for men's national teams held once every four years by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). After the 2014 FIBA World Cup, the tournament will move to a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup. To that end, no tournament will be held in 2018; the FIBA World Cup will resume in 2019. The current champions are Spain. They defeated Argentina 95-75 in the 2019 tournament at the Cadillac Center in Beijing, China. == Tournaments == Year Hosts Gold Medal Game Gold Medal Game Gold Medal Game Bronze Medal Game Bronze Medal Game Bronze Medal Game Number of Teams Year Hosts Gold Score Silver Bronze Score Fourth Place Number of Teams 1950 No playoffs No playoffs 10 1954 No playoffs No playoffs 12 1959 No playoffs No playoffs 13 1963 No playoffs No playoffs 13 1967 No playoffs No playoffs 13 1970 No playoffs No playoffs 13 1974 No playoffs No playoffs 14 1978 82–81 OT 86–85 14 1982 95–94 119–117 13 1986 87–85 117–91 24 1990 92–75 107–105 OT 16 1994 137–91 78–60 16 1998 64–62 84–61 16 2002 84–77 OT 117–94 16 2006 70–47 96–81 24 2010 81–64 99–88 24 2014 129–92 95–93 24 2019 Future event Future event 32 2023 Future event Future event 32 (expected) ==Related pages== * Basketball ==References== Notes Category:Basketball",
