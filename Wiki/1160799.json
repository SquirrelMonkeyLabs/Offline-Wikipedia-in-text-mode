These clinics offer dental, vision, and medical care to people who do not have enough money for health care. Sometimes, they also provide veterinary services for animals. Stan Brock, a British philanthropist, founded RAM. At first, RAM was meant to help people in developing countries. However, it now focuses on helping people in the United States who need health care. == History == RAM was started in 1985 by Stan Brock. He used to work with Marlin Perkins on the TV show Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. At first, RAM helped people in poor countries. Later, it started helping people in the United States too.
