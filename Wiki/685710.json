 "text": "Stephen Edward Ambrose (January 10, 1936 â€“ October 13, 2002) was an American historian and author. He wrote the biographies of the U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. He wrote many war books, including bestsellers, such as Band of Brothers, Undaunted Courage and Citizen Soldiers. Band of Brothers was famously made into a 2001 HBO miniseries of the same name. The miniseries was created by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. He was also the longtime professor of history at the University of New Orleans until his retirement in 1995. In 2002, it was reported that Ambrose had copied others' work and added them to his own writings (plagiarism). Ambrose denied these claims. Ambrose was born in Lovington, Illinois. He grew up in Whitewater, Wisconsin. He married Judith Dorlester in 1957, and had two children with her. After Dorlester's death in 1965, he married Moira Buckley in 1967. He adopted her three children. Ambrose died of lung cancer on October 13, 2002 in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He was 66. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1936 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Academics from Louisiana Category:American historians Category:American novelists Category:American biographers Category:Writers from Wisconsin",
