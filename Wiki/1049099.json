The song was able to make it to #1 on the Canada Rock, #1 on the Alternative Airplay, #1 on the Mainstream Rock, #44 on the Billboard Hot 100, and #47 on the Pop 100 charts. The song was certified Platinum by both Music Canada and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Billboard ranked the song #25 on their list of Greatest of All Time Mainstream Rock Songs. When writing his tour diary, vocalist Adam Gontier said that the song had a \"feeling like you're constantly numb to things around you, thanks to your own actions, and it's about being sick of that feeling.\" A music video for the song was released. It was directed by Tony Petrossian. In the video, the band plays in an abandoned warehouse. Multiple young people are shown singing to the song. Most of the actions that the youth do are synced with the same actions that Gontier does. It's shown that they all have a red X tattooed on the back of their necks. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2006 songs Category:Three Days Grace songs Category:Alternative rock songs",
