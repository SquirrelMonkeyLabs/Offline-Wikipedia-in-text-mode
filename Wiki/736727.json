 "text": "The Supreme Federal Court (, , abbreviated STF) is the supreme court (court of last resort) of Brazil, serving primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country. It is the highest court of law in Brazil. On 8 January 2023, supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed and invaded the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília, taking over the offices of the Supreme Federal Court, National Congress of Brazil and the Palácio do Planalto. The event was seen as an attempted coup d'état to overturn the election results of the 2022 general election. ==Current Justices== Order of antiquity Minister Born (date and state) Appointed by Age in inauguration Initial date (inauguration) Limit date (retirement) Main previous functions 1 Gilmar Ferreira Mendes 30 December 1955 in Mato Grosso Fernando Henrique Cardoso 46 20 June 2002 2030 Prosecutor of the Republic (1985-1988), deputy chief for Legal Issues of the Chief of Staff (1996-2000), Attorney General of the Union (2000-2002) 2 Enrique Ricardo Lewandowski 11 May 1948 in Rio de Janeiro Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 57 16 May 2006 2023 Lawyer (1974-1990), judge from Criminal Arres Court of São Paulo (1990-1997), desembargador of Justice Court of the State of São Paulo (1997-2006), professor of State law in Law School, University of São Paulo (USP) (2003-2006) 3 Cármen Lúcia Antunes Rocha 19 April 1954 in Minas Gerais Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 52 21 June 2006 2029 Attorney of the State of Minas Gerais (1983-2006) 4 José Antonio Dias Toffoli 15 November 1967 in São Paulo Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva 41 23 October 2009 2042 Lawyer (1991-2009), deputy chief for Legal Issues of the Chief of Staff (2003-2005), Attorney General of the Union (2007-2009) 5 Luiz Fux 26 April 1953 in Rio de Janeiro Dilma Rousseff 57 3 March 2011 2028 Prosecutor of Public Prosecutor's Office of Rio de Janeiro (1979-1982), judge of the state of Rio de Janeiro (1983-1997), desembargador of the Justice Court of the state of Rio de Janeiro (1997-2001), minister of STJ (2001-2011) 6 Rosa Maria Weber Candiota da Rosa 2 October 1948 in Rio Grande do Sul Dilma Rousseff 63 19 December 2011 2023 Labor judge (1976-1991), judge of Regional Labor Court (TRT) - 4th Region (1991-2006), minister of TST (2006-2011) 7 Luís Roberto Barroso 11 March 1958 in Rio de Janeiro Dilma Rousseff 55 26 June 2013 2033 Lawyer (1981-2013), Attorney of the State of Rio de Janeiro (1985-2013) 8 Luiz Edson Fachin 8 February 1958 in Rio Grande do Sul Dilma Rousseff 57 16 June 2015 2033 Lawyer (1980-2015), Attorney of the State of Paraná (1990-2006) 9 Alexandre de Moraes 13 December 1968 in São Paulo Michel Temer 48 22 March 2017 2043 Prosecutor of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the state of São Paulo (1991-2002), lawyer of public law (2010-2014), Minister of Justice and Public Security (2016-2017) 10 Kassio Nunes Marques 16 May 1972 in Piauí Jair Bolsonaro 48 5 November 2020 2047 Lawyer (1996-2011), judge of Regional Electoral Court of Piauí (TRE-PI) (2008-2011), judge of Regional Federal Court (TRF) - 1st Region (2011-2020) 11 André Luiz de Almeida Mendonça 27 December 1972 in São Paulo Jair Bolsonaro 48 16 November 2021 2047 Lawyer (1997-2000), Union Attorney (2000-2019), Attorney General of the Union (2019-2020), Minister of Justice and Public Security (2020-2021), Attorney General of the Union (2021) ; Notes * M.
