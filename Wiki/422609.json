 "text": "Pain & Gain is a melodramatic 2013 criminal-comedy movie. It is about events which take place between late 1994 until mid 1995. These events involve several gangsters called The Sun Gym Gang. They kidnap several people, kill others, use steroids, rob armored vehicles and do certain drugs. The events within the movie, however, are fictionalized or made up versions for events that actually happened. The events did happen, although the real-life events are far different from those in Pain & Gain. The movie got mixed reviews, only half of which were good or positive. It performed well, though, in the overall box office. It was released April 26, 2013. Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson are in this movie.
