 "text": "Aasiya Zubair, also known as Aasiya Hassan (June 17, 1972 â€“ February 12, 2009) was married to Muzzammil Hassan, who started Bridges TV, the first American Muslim TV channel. In February 2009, she was found dead at the Bridges TV station in Orchard Park, New York. Her husband turned himself in and was charged with her murder. ==Career== Zubair was an architect. She wanted to change the way people saw Muslims. She thought there should be a TV channel for American Muslims, so their children could feel proud of their identity. She came up with the idea for Bridges TV. She also studied for an MBA at the State University of New York College at Buffalo from 2007 to 2009. ==Murder== On February 12, 2009, Hassan tricked Zubair to come to the TV studio where they used to work. He attacked her with two knives, stabbing her around 40 times and then he cut off her head. Zubair had asked for a divorce a week before she was killed. ==Legacy== Every second Saturday in February, International Purple Hijab Day is observed to remembers Zubair's life. ==References== ==Other websites== *In Memory of Aasiya Zubair (Facebook group) *International Purple Hijab Day Category:1972 births Category:2009 deaths",
