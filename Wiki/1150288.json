The STS was sold mainly in the United States, but a similar version called the Cadillac SLS was sold in China until 2013. ==STS-V== The STS-V was a high-performance version of the STS, introduced in 2005. It had a supercharged V8 engine that produced 469 horsepower, making it much faster than the regular STS. ==Sales== The STS was sold in the United States and other countries, but it was especially popular in North America. Sales were highest in 2005, but dropped in later years. The final STS was made in 2011, and it was replaced by the Cadillac XTS. ==Chinese Version-SLS== A similar model, called the Cadillac SLS, was made for the Chinese market. It had a longer wheelbase and some different features but looked very similar to the STS. The SLS was sold from 2006 until 2013. ==References== STS",
