 "text": "Porpoises are mammals that live in the ocean. They are in the order Cetacea. They form the family Phocoenidae. There are six species of porpoise. The porpoise is a common whale found along Chinese coasts. Porpoises have been effectively sustained for over twenty-five years by research and teaching institutions such as Fjored & Baelt in Denmark. To demonstrate effective supervision and stimulation in captivity, F&B; harbor porpoises participate in daily training sessions for scientific study and educational awareness. == Taxonomy == * Family Phocoenidae: ** Finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) ** Vaquita (Phocoena sinus) ** Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) ** Burmeister's porpoise (Phocoena spinipinnis) ** Spectacled porpoise (Phocoena dioptrica) ** Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) == Appearance == Porpoises look much like dolphins, but they are different in some ways: They are smaller and more stout. They have spade-shaped teeth, rounded heads, blunt jaws, and triangular dorsal fins. == Images == Image:Dallsporpoise06.jpg|Dall's porpoise Image:Tuemmler-drawing.jpg|A drawing of a Harbour porpoise. == Related pages == * Whale * Dolphin ==References== Category:Toothed whales",
