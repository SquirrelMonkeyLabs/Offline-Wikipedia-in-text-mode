 "text": "An art movement, or ism, is a style in art. It may have a common philosophy, followed by a group of artists. It may be a label given by a critic to describe a type of artwork. It is typical of the post-photography era that art explores new directions. Some art movements can be pinned down to a time and place, or to particular artists. Verbal explanation of movements may come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto (published statement). Quite often, a movement is labelled afterwards by some art historian or critic. Art movements may be connected to similar ideas in architecture, literature, philosophy or even politics. In rough date order: * classicism * neoclassicism * impressionism * Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood * post-impressionism * Art Nouveau * modern art * abstract art * cubism * fauvism * futurism * expressionism * suprematism * geometric abstraction * constructivism * dadaism * Art Deco * surrealism * contemporary art * abstract expressionism * pop art * op art * conceptual art",
