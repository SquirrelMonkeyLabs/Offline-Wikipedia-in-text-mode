Its name comes from the Latin words Fennia (which means Finland) and Scandia (which means Scandinavia). Fennoscandia is different from both Scandinavia and the Nordic countries. Denmark is not in the Scandinavian Peninsula and Karelia and the Kola Peninsula are not a part of the Nordic countries. They are a part of Russia. The geography of Fennoscandia is very mountainous and rough. It is also very beautiful with sights such as fjords, which take up a lot of space in Norway. Socially Fennoscandia shows the historically close relationship between the Finnish, Norwegian, Russian, SÃ¡mi and Swedish people. It also includes the Karelia area which until near the end of the Second World War was part of Finland. Until 1956 much of the area was a Soviet Republic and it remains an administrative division of Russia. == References == == Other websites == * The Green Belt of Fennoscandia Category:Peninsulas of Europe Category:Regions of Europe",
