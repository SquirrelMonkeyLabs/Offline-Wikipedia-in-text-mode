 "text": "The California wildfires of October 2007 were more than 20 wildfires until November 9, 2007 burning in Southern California, making over 1,000,000 people to leave their homes, breaking at least 1,500 homes and buildings and moving in on at least 56,000 more. At least of land were burned between Santa Barbara County and the Mexican border. Officials said that they feared the fire could become even more deadly than the 2003 Cedar Fire. The number and strength of the fires have tired the firefighters, with one department saying the \"lack of resources [is] hindering suppression efforts.\" The fires killed six people and have hurt at least 16 firefighters and 25 others. California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in seven California counties where fires burned. President Bush has declared an emergency in the State of California and ordered Federal aid to help State and local efforts. An event that helped the fires is the drought in Southern California. The fires have been strengthened by the strangely strong Santa Ana winds. The winds are believed to have broken power lines, creating some of the fires. One fire was because of arson; one was started by an flipped-over semi- truck. Why the other fires are happening it not yet known. Winds were not expected to get better until October 25 2007. ==Fires== ===San Diego County=== San Diego County is where the two biggest fires were, the Witch Fire near the northeastern edge of the city of San Diego, and the Harris fire southeast of San Diego. The Witch fire forced Interstate 15 to be closed, and the Harris fire was near the border with Mexico. As of the night of October 22, 2007, at least 5,000 homes were in danger. About 500,000 people had to leave, the largest evacuation in the area's history. Evacuees were meeting at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, Qualcomm Stadium and other places in the county. Officials think that 10,000 were meeting at Qualcomm. As well as food, blankets and water, volunteers gave toys to children, massages, and a live rock and roll band show. Many schools and business were closed. The only burn unit in the county, the UCSD Medical Center in Hillcrest was operated on an overflow basis. The unit, which has 18 beds, had 16 fire victims and several patients with injuries not due to the blazes.

Approximately 6,800 structures were in danger, including 5,000 homes. Hundreds of thousands of people living there were told of evacuations through the Reverse 911 system. This evacuation comes almost exactly four years after the Cedar Fire of 2003. The fire started near Santa Ysabel and quickly spread to Ramona, Rancho Bernardo, Poway and Escondido. From there the fire jumped over the Interstate 15 and kept moving west, causing bad damage in the areas of Lake Hodges, 4S Ranch, Del Dios, Harmony Grove and Rancho Santa Fe. Heavy Santa Ana winds pushed the fires west near the coast. San Diego County Sheriff William B. Kolendar said that the Witch Creek Fire could be \"well in excess of Cedar Fire of 2003\". Officials also said that the fire could reach the coastline; people living in Solana Beach were told to be ready to evacuate. All residents south of Del Dios Highway, north of Sorrento Valley Road, west of Interstate 15, and east of Interstate 5 were told to evacuate. By 9:30pm October 22, 2007 a dispatch from the city of Del Mar's web site stated \"For your safety, we are strongly advising that all Del Mar residents evacuate.\" Evacuations were also ordered for Scripps Ranch neighborhood, mostly \"Everything south of Scripps Poway Parkway, north of MCAS Miramar, east of Interstate 15, and west of Highway 67\". The Mesa Grande Indian reservation was evacuated from the Witch Fire. Residents of the Barona Indian Reservation were told to leave if they wish. The casino on the reservation was closed.

The fire is 50% under control; 100% expected by October 24 at 6 p.m. ==Wind and weather== The fires were in a very dry area and they were made worse by seasonal winds called the Santa Ana winds. The San Diego Union Tribune reported, \"Santa Ana winds blowing up to 60 mph combined with temperatures into the 90s to create in the worst possible fire conditions.\" Southern California was in the midst of an unusual drought; in Los Angeles, California, with only 3.21 in (82 mm) of precipitation in the entire 2006-2007 rain season, it is the driest year on record, receiving less rain than Death Valley in a normal year. The Santa Ana winds are warm, dry winds that characteristically appear in Southern California and Northern Baja California weather during autumn and early winter. Santa Anas are a type of föhn wind, the result of air pressure buildup in the high-altitude Great Basin between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains. This high energy wind spills out of the Great Basin and is pulled by gravity into the surrounding lowlands. The air circulates clockwise around the high pressure area bringing winds from the east and northeast to Southern California (the reverse of the westerly winds characteristic of the latitude). The air heats up due to adiabatic heating while being compressed during its descent. While the air has already been dried by orographic lift prior to reaching the Great Basin, the relative humidity of the air declines rapidly as it descends and warms in its final stages as it passes over the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges. The air is then forced down the mountain slopes out towards the Pacific coast; the air mass is further heated by compression as it drops in altitude before reaching the Los Angeles Basin, western San Diego County and Tijuana (Baja California) at typical speeds of 35 knots. The southern California coastal region gets some of its hottest weather of the year during autumn while Santa Ana winds are blowing. During Santa Ana conditions it is typically hotter along the coast than in the deserts and the humidity plummets to less than 15%. As the Santa Ana winds are channeled through the mountain passes they can approach hurricane force. The combination of wind, heat, and dryness turns the chaparral into explosive fuel for the infamous wildfires the region is known for. Wildfires fanned by Santa Ana winds burned 721,791 acres (2,921 km²) in two weeks during October 2003. As of October 22, the high wind conditions were expected to continue to hamper firefighting for three additional days. At around 12:30 PM, officials believed that some of the fires were generating their own winds, similar to the Oakland Firestorm of 1991. ==Impact== On October 21, the Harris Fire damaged and disabled the Southwest Power Link, a 500,000-volt power line from Arizona to San Diego. Power outages were reported in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and other counties on October 22 to 333,500 Southern California Edison customers, most being restored within 24 hours. The power outage also affected the areas of Ojai, Oxnard, Simi Valley, Santa Clarita, Thousand Oaks, Rialto, Fontana, San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga, Mira Loma, Hesperia, Corona, Bloomington, Irvine, Calimesa and Rubidoux. This outage also caused 230 people to be without power in Malibu. The California Independent System Operator Corp, or California ISO, declared an energy transmission emergency in southern California on October 23, due to wildfires affecting the lines. 500,000-, 230,000- and 138,000-volt lines were disabled in San Diego, and some lines in other areas were also disabled. 24,992 lost power, due to lack of power from the power grid. The San Diego Community College District on October 22, 2007 initially closed Miramar College, followed by Mesa College and selected Continuing Education sites in the northern area of the District. Effective at 3:00 p.m. the same day all colleges, campuses and sites of the San Diego Community College District were closed and would remain so through at least October 23, 2007. Students and faculty were urged to seek an update on possible closures on October 23 after 5:00pm local time. Numerous other schools, businesses and universities closed as well, including California State University, San Marcos, San Diego State University, UC San Diego, the University of San Diego and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. Classes for Tuesday, October 23 were canceled for all of San Diego Unified School District and all other districts in the county and all schools in the municipalities of Tijuana, Tecate and Rosarito, located across the border in Baja California, Mexico. In the Santa Clarita area, classes and events were cancelled at College of the Canyons and CalArts; local public schools were cancelled as well. All public schools were closed in Malibu, and there were some school closings in Orange County, Ventura County and San Bernardino County. By mid-morning on October 22, 2007, thousands of evacuees were taking shelter in Qualcomm Stadium and other locations throughout San Diego. On the afternoon of October 22, 2007, the Marines were evacuating some planes from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to other military bases in California and Arizona. The San Diego Wild Animal Park moved some animals to the on-site animal hospital for their protection. As of October 22 2007, with Qualcomm Stadium still hosting evacuees, the San Diego State University football team was still planning to host their Saturday game against BYU in the stadium. Some players and coaches were affected by evacuations. Numerous San Diego area high schools canceled games and practices at least through October 24 2007. With many players from the San Diego Chargers affected by evacuations, the team moved practices to Arizona and they may move their upcoming game there as well. ==Response== Government agencies and volunteers worked together to mitigate the effects of the fires. According to the state of California's Consolidated Response web page, \"There are 17 active fires in Southern California. The priority for fighting fires as of 1930 on October 21 is the Buckweed, Witch, Harris, Canyon, Ranch, Santiago, and Sedgewick Fires.\" With many businesses and schools closed, some people used their time off to help others. Officials estimated that 10,000 people were gathered at Qualcomm stadium, the largest shelter point in San Diego. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opened ten of its churches as temporary shelters and, at the request of the mayor of San Diego, delivered two truckloads of blankets and processed food to evacuees in Qualcomm Stadium.LDS Church responds to California wildfires abc4.com The Salvation Army provided food, water and comfort to firefighters, police and others affected by the blaze. The Navy and Marines were also helping in San Diego. Six crews from the Navy's Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 85 based at Naval Air Station North Island were assigned to battle the Witch Creek fire. They fly MH-60 Seahawk helicopters which have a 420-gallon water bucket and they are the only local Navy teams trained to fight fires from the air. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar contributed several aircraft as well as fire fighting trucks to operations based in Ramona. ==References== ==Other websites== * CNN updates * Los Angeles Times Breaking News * SanDiego.gov Emergency Fire Information * Google map showing fire locations and information on their size and containment ** Google map with detailed information relevant to San Diego * SignOnSanDiego fire blog * Fire maps * State of California Consolidated Report on Fires * The San Bernardino Sun and Inland Valley Daily Bulletin fire blog * The San Bernardino Sun's Fire Updates * KPBS updates via Twitter Category:2007 in California Category:2000s disasters in the United States Category:Natural disasters in the United States Category:Fires in California Category:2007 disasters Category:Wildfires",
