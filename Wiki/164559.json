 "text": "Little Anthony and the Imperials are an African-American vocal group of the 1950s and 1960s. Their lead singer was \"Little Anthony\" Gourdine. They began as a doo-wop group, but changed to other kinds of music as musical trends changed. Their hit records included \"Tears On My Pillow,\" \"Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko- Ko Bop,\" \"I'm on the Outside (Looking In),\" \"Goin' Out Of My Head,\" and \"Hurt So Bad.\" Teddy Randazzo was producer and co-songwriter of several of their songs that people liked the most. The group became less popular during the late 1960s, but they still recorded songs until 1975. Little Anthony still performed the group's old hits for many years, at oldies concerts. ==Other websites== * Official website ==References== Category:American boy bands Category:American R&B; bands Category:Soul bands Category:African-American musical groups Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:1958 establishments in the United States Category:1950s establishments in New York (state) Category:Musical groups established in 1958",
