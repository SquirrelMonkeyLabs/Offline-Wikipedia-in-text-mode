 "text": "Future bass is an EDM genre. It features modulated synthesizer bass sounds. The genre was brought to mainstream by Flume, Lido, Wave Racer, and Cashmere Cat. It was also popularised in the mid-2010s by artists like Louis the Child, Marshmello, Martin Garrix, Mura Masa and San Holo. 2016 was seen as the breakout year for the genre. ==History== The future bass roots can be traced back to Burial's self-titled album, released in 2006. The genre was pioneered by Rustie, Hudson Mohawke and RL Grime, who began producing future bass tracks in 2010. One of the first popularity-fueling releases in the genre was Rustie album Glass Swords, released in 2011. Later, in 2013, the Flume remix for Disclosure's song \"You & Me\" brought the genre into the mainstream. Then future bass became popular in the United Kingdom, United States, Japan, China, Korea and Australia. Future bass tracks with mainstream pop influences often use supersaw chords. Underground tracks tend to experiment, blending real instruments into the songs and using many different sounds. == References == Category:Music genres Category:Electronic dance music",
