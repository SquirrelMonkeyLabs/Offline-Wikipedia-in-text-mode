 "text": "A debit card (also known as a bank card or check card) is a plastic card that is used as a payment method to cash when buying things. It is similar to a credit card, but unlike a credit card, it does not borrow money. Instead, the money comes directly from the user's bank account, and if there is no money it does not work. ==Related pages== *Electronic money Category:Money",
