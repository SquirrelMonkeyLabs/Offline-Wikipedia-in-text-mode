 "text": "Deventer is a municipality and city in the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. About 101,000 people were living there in 2021. It lies both in Salland and IJsselvallei regions, alongside the eastern bank of the IJssel river. Deventer was founded by Lebuinus around 768. He built a wooden church there. A Catholic community called the Brethren of the Common Life was founded by priest Geert Groote in this city late 14th century. This community was connected with a Catholic reform movement called the Devotio Moderna, which was largely based on Groote and founded the same time. Deventer is well known for its cake, the so-called Deventer Koek. == References == * Plaatsengids.nl Category:Cities in Overijssel Category:Municipalities of Overijssel Category:IJsselvallei (Overijssel) Category:Salland",
