 "text": "The Orpheum is a theatre and music venue. It is located on 884 Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Orpheum is a part of the Vancouver Civic Theatres group of live performance venues along with the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and Vancouver Playhouse. It was opened on November 7, 1927 as a vaudeville house although they had their first show the day before. When it opened in 1927, The Orpheum was the biggest theatre in Canada, had three thousand seats and cost $1.25 million to build. When vaudeville was slowing down from its popularity, the Orpheum found new owners in Famous Players and became mainly a movie house but hosted live events every now and then. In 1973, Famous Players wanted to turn the place into a multiplex because of economic reasons. There was a \"Save the Orpheum\" public protest that was launched, which Jack Benny flew in to help with. The Orpheum was then saved. It is the home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The Orpheum was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on November 15, 1979. ==References== ==Other websites== *Official website Category:Theatres Category:Buildings and structures in Vancouver Category:1927 establishments in North America Category:1920s establishments in Canada",
