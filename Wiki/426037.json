It took place on November 18, 2001 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was the 15th Survivor Series event held by the WWF. The show featured matches between wrestlers representing the WWF and The Alliance. In the main event, Team WWF (The Undertaker, Chris Jericho, Kane, Big Show and The Rock) defeated The Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T and Shane McMahon) in a Winner Takes All 5-on-5 Survivor Series match. Also, two unification matches took place: The Dudley Boyz (D-Von and Bubba Ray Dudley) defeated The Hardy Boyz (Jeff and Matt Hardy) in a Steel Cage match to unify the WCW World Tag Team Championship and the WWF World Tag Team Championship, while Edge defeated Test to unify the WWE Intercontinental Championship and the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Survivor Series was the last event of the The Invasion angle, as the Alliance broke up after the show. ==Matches== === Survivor Series elimination match === Eliminated Wrestler Eliminated by Team Method Time Big Show Shane McMahon WWF Pinfall 12:42 Shane McMahon Chris Jericho Alliance 14:30 Kane Rob Van Dam WWF 18:56 The Undertaker Kurt Angle 20:03 Booker T The Rock Alliance 22:33 Rob Van Dam Chris Jericho 25:48 Kurt Angle The Rock Submission 32:22 Chris Jericho Stone Cold Steve Austin WWF Pinfall 34:50 Stone Cold Steve Austin The Rock Alliance 44:57 The Rock (Team WWF) ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Survivor Series 2001 website Category:2001 in professional wrestling Category:2001 in American television Category:2000s in sports in North Carolina Category:Survivor Series Category:Greensboro, North Carolina Category:November events",
