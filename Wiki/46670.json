A ladder is used to get up to the top bunk. The ladder is usually attached to the bed. In the Philippines, a bunk bed is called a double deck. Bunk bed is a modern solution; crafted when a one-bed frame is placed on top of another, making a rigid structure of two or more beds. This way two beds are compacted together to form a single bed which is efficient. A bunk bed occupies less floor area, it is equal to the space normally necessary for only one bed. ==Use in homes== Bunk beds are often used in children's rooms. Since bunk beds allow a family to put two beds in the space of a single bed, bunk beds save space. Bunk beds help families with small apartments or houses to have enough beds for their children. ==Use in institutions and public facilities== A bunk bed is also called ‘the wider bed’, which means both the top and bottom are of the same wider size. They are essential furnishing items that hostels, dormitories, colleges, and schools prefer to install. ==Use in government and public facilities== Bunk beds are often used in institutions such as prisons. As well, they are often used in public facilities such as homeless shelters and bomb shelters. Bunk beds are also used in firehalls, to give firefighters a place to sleep. Many military organizations use bunk beds. Navy ships and submarines use bunk beds for the sailors to sleep in. Army barracks sometimes have bunk beds for soldiers to sleep in. ==Use in camps and hostels== Summer camps and winter cabins for children (such as boy scouts or girl scouts) often have bunk beds.
