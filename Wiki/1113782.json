He did not like the swimming classes at the swimming school. Finally, after some time, he did not have to attend the swimming classes anymore. He stayed in the music classes but couldn't proceed to higher levels because he never finished his homework. Ichinose started playing piano. However, he did not practice music pieces he didn't like until his junior high. He started to get into video game music around this time. He started practicing tracks from a record from his childhood on his piano. == Career == In 1993, Ichinose started working at Game Freak part-time to study programming and to get qualified. His study of programming didn't have any progress because instead of studying programming, he used to make music. He made music for Pokémon Gold and Silver in 1999 and has become a member of the sound team after that. ==Works== year title role 1996 Bazaru de Gozaru no Game De Gozaru Music 1997 Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha Game Design 1999 Click Medic Game Design, Music Pokémon Gold and Silver Music with Junichi Masuda Pokémon Pinball Music 2000 Pokémon Crystal Music with Junichi Masuda and Morikazu Aoki 2002 Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Music with Junichi Masuda and Morikazu Aoki 2004 Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Music with Morikazu Aoki Pokémon Emerald Music with Hitomi Sato 2005 Drill Dozer Music with Satoshi Nohara 2006 Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Music with Hitomi Sato and Junichi Masuda 2008 Pokémon Platinum Music with Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda and Satoshi Nohara 2009 Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver Music with Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda, Shota Kageyama and Takuto Kitsuta 2010 Pokémon Black and White Music with Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda, Minako Adachi and Shota Kageyama 2012 Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 Music with Hitomi Sato 2013 Pocket Card Jockey Game Design, Music 2016 Pokémon Sun and Moon Music with Hideaki Kuroda, Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda, Minako Adachi and Tomaoki Oga 2017 Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon Music with Junichi Masuda, Minako Adachi and Tomaoki Oga 2019 Little Town Hero Sound Manager Pokémon Sword and Shield Music with Keita Okamoto, Minako Adachi and Toby Fox 2022 Pokémon Legends: Arceus Music with Hiromitsu Maeba and Hitomi Sato Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Music with Hiromitsu Maeba, Hitomi Sato, Junichi Masuda, Minako Adachi, Teruo Taniguchi and Toby Fox 2023 Pocket Jockey: Ride On!
