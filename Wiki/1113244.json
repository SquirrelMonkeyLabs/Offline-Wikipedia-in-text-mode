He had Polish ancestry. Apollinaire is one of the most important poets of the early 20th century. He defended Cubism and helped start Surrealism. He invented the words \"Cubism\" in 1911, \"Orphism\" in 1912, and \"Surrealism\" in 1917. Apollinaire wrote many early Surrealist works. One of these was the play The Breasts of Tiresias (1917). This play became the basis for Francis Poulenc's 1947 opera Les mamelles de Tirésias. When Guillaume was young, he was influenced by Symbolist poetry. During his life, he was admired by the young poets who helped influence Surrealism. He was very original, and his work was not based on any theory. Apollinaire was also a journalist and art critic for Le Matin, L'Intransigeant, L'Esprit nouveau, Mercure de France, and Paris Journal. In 1912, Apollinaire cofounded Les Soirées de Paris, an artistic and literary magazine. Apollinaire was wounded in World War I. During the pandemic of 1918, Apollinaire died of the Spanish flu.Catherine Moore, Mark Moore, Guillaume Apollinaire official website, Biographie: Chronologie, Western Illinois University ==Works== File:Guillaume Apollinaire, Poème Calligramme.jpg|A Calligramme by Guillaume ApollinaireAction: Cahiers Individualistes De Philosophie Et D’art, October 1920, Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Image:La muse inspirant le poète.jpg|The Muse Inspiring the Poet, portrait of Apollinaire and Marie Laurencin, by Henri Rousseau, 1909 Image:Père-Lachaise - Division 86 - tombe Apollinaire 01.jpg|Apollinaire's grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery File:ApollinaireLeidenWallPoems.jpg|Poem by Apollinaire on a wall in Leiden ===Poetry=== * L'enchanteur pourrissant (1909).
