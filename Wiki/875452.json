The majority of keys come directly from publishers, with the occasional need to offer keys for games from publishers that were not able to give them directly due to commercial limitations. Following this, in November 2015, the company placed information on each game's store page on their site to finf the source of the redemption keys, either through Green Man Gaming directly from the publisher, or through an authorised third-party reseller, for full clarity. == References == Category:Video game companies of the United Kingdom",
