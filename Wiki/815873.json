The university campus is in Podil in Kyiv, between Kontraktova Square and the Dnipro river. Teaching at the university is in Ukrainian and English. From 2009 to 2014 it was an autonomous research university. NaUKMA is the successor of the historical Kyiv-Mohyla Academy which was founded on the basis of the Kyiv Brotherhood School. In 1615, this school received funds from the noblewoman Halshka Hulevychivna. Some teachers of Lviv and Lutsk brotherhood schools moved to Kyiv to teach in Kyiv Mohyla Academy. The school had the support of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, Hetman Sahaidachnyi and Hetman Mazepa. In September 1632, the Kyiv Brotherhood School merged with the Lavra School. As a result, the Kyiv-Bratsk Collegium was established. Kyiv Metropolitan Petro Mohyla built an education system on the model of Jesuit educational institutions. Much attention in the board was paid to the study of languages, including Polish and Latin. == References == Category:1610s establishments in Europe Category:Establishments in Ukraine Category:Colleges and universities in Kyiv",
