 "text": "The light-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus sinensis), also called the Chinese bulbul, Japanese bulbul and white-vented bulbul. is a kind of bird in the bulbul family found in central and southern China, Hong Kong, Macao, northern Vietnam, southern Japan and Taiwan, and sometimes South Korea. A common kind of songbird that likes areas of light woods, it can often be seen in towns, suburbs and parks within its range. ==Classification and relationships== The light-vented bulbul was first thought to be an Old World flycatcher and put into the group Muscicapa. ===Subspecies=== The bird is split into four subspecies: * P. s. sinensis (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Found in central and eastern China. * P. s. hainanus (Swinhoe, 1870) – First described as another bird in the group Ixos. Found in southeastern China and northern Vietnam. * P. s. formosae Hartert, E, 1910 – Found on Taiwan. * P. s. orii Kuroda, 1923 – Found on Yonaguni, Okinawa, Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands (southern Ryukyu Islands). ==Description== The light-vented bulbul has a large white patch covering the nape and the sides of its black head. It also sings sweetly with a cha-ko- lee...cha-ko-lee... sound. It has a white color from the back of its eyes to the back of its head. ==Range and habitat== In Hong Kong, the light-vented bulbul is common in lightly wooded areas, farmland and shrubland, whereas the red-whiskered bulbul is the common bulbul of suburbs and town parks. In Taiwan, however, the light-vented bulbul is the most common in all of these landscapes, except on the east coast where the Styan's bulbul is found instead. Chinese bulbuls are seen commonly in Shanghai, and are maybe the third most common bird after sparrows and mourning doves.. ==References== ==Other websites== * Birds of Love River: Chinese bulbul - Pycnonotus sinensis * Birds Korea Category:Birds of Asia Category:Birds of China Category:Passeri",
