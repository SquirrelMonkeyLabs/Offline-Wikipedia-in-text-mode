 "text": "Critical theory is an idea created by the Frankfurt School in 1937 which says that almost all of the institutions of society are based on hierarchy and wants to show how those hierarchies are built into society and created so that the powerful can become more powerful while everyone else suffers. The Frankfurt School thought that those hierarchies were based on capitalism and that people should be fighting against capitalism by fighting against the culture it created because those hierarchies were against justice.
