 "text": "Koo was an Indian microblogging and social media platform, similar to Twitter. It was owned by a company called Bombinate Technologies, based in Bangalore. The app was co-founded by two Indian entrepreneurs, Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka. Koo was launched in early 2020 and quickly gained attention. It became more popular after winning the Indian government's Atmanirbhar App Innovation Challenge, a contest that picked the best apps from about 7,000 entries across India. The app was part of efforts to promote local, made-in- India digital platforms. As of November 2022, the company was valued at over $275 million. Investors in Bombinate Technologies include Tiger Global Management, Blume Ventures, Kalaari Capital and Accel, and former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai's 3one4 Capital. ==References== Category:Social networking services Category:Microblogging services",
