 "text": "The Conch Republic is a micronation secession of the city of Key West, Florida, from the United States on April 23, 1982. Since then, the term \"Conch Republic\" has expanded to refer to \"all of the Florida Keys\". While the protests that created the Conch Republic have been described by some as \"tongue-in-cheek,\" they were caused by frustrations over real concerns. The original protest event was caused by a U.S. Border Patrol roadblock and checkpoint that was inconvenient to residence. The Conch Republic celebrates its Independence Day every April 23 as part of a week-long festival of activities involving numerous businesses in Key West. The organization — a \"Sovereign State of Mind\", seeking only to bring more \"Humor, Warmth and Respect\" to a world in sore need of all three according to its late Secretary General, Peter Anderson — is a key tourism booster for the area.
