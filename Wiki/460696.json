It originally aired on Disney Channel from July 19, 2013 to March 24, 2017. The show stars Dove Cameron in a dual role as identical twin sisters. They have completely different personalities and are best friends. Liv is an actress. She has come back to her home after living in Hollywood for four years. She was the star of a popular television show called Sing It Loud!. Maddie is a basketball prodigy. The show is about Liv having to get used to normal family life again after production on Sing It Loud! ended. It is also about the two sisters being best friends despite their different personalities and different interests. The show also stars Joey Bragg, Tenzing Norgay Trainor, Kali Rocha, and Benjamin King. The characters they play are Joey Rooney, Parker Rooney, Karen Rooney, and Pete Rooney. Joey and Parker are Liv and Maddie's younger brothers. Karen and Pete are their mother and father. In the last season of the show, Lauren Lindsey Donzis joined the cast. She played Liv and Maddie's younger cousin Ruby. Ruby becomes their \"sorta-sister\". Her character replaced Pete. Pete was not in any of the episodes of the fourth season. == Plot == After finishing a four-year stint in Hollywood filming a popular television show called Sing It Loud!, actress Liv Rooney returns to her birthplace of Stevens Point, Wisconsin to the open arms of her family, despite being offered more roles in other shows and movies. Liv decided to come home because she missed her family and wanted to see them again. She is happily reunited with her identical twin sister Maddie. Maddie is her best friend. Liv is a girly girl. She enjoys anytime someone mentions her former career. Maddie is a tomboy with a talent for basketball. She is the captain of her school's basketball team. The twins have two younger brothers. They are Joey and Parker. Joey is a typical awkward teen. He is one year younger than the twins. Parker is a clever tween. He has a mischievous personality. Parker is the youngest child of the Rooney family. Their father Pete is the coach for Maddie's basketball team. He eventually achieves his dream of becoming the coach of a college team in Beloit, Wisconsin. Their mother Karen is the school psychologist and later vice principal starting in the second season. In the first three seasons, most events take place at either Ridgewood High, the high school that Liv, Maddie, Joey, and later Parker, due to being a child prodigy, all attend, or the Rooney residence. At the end of the third season, the Rooney house collapses due to a series of tunnels created by Parker and Maddie is accepted into a college in Los Angeles, California. This prompts the rest of the Rooneys, except Pete who remains in Wisconsin to continue his coaching job, to move to Malibu, California, to take up residence with Karen's younger sister Dena and her daughter Ruby, where the show's forth season takes place. In the last episode of the series, all the Rooneys part ways. Liv is invited to perform in a musical called Double Duchess on Broadway, Maddie is given a grant to build tiny houses for the homeless in New Orleans, Joey is invited to go on a comedy tour with Jim Breuer, and Parker is invited to go with his friend Val to a biodome in the salt flats of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia to study life on Mars. A big part of the show are documentary-style cutaways where major characters and the supporting characters talk to the viewers to explain various things and their opinions on the situations in which they are featured in each episode. In the last episode, it is revealed that the cutaways are part of a reality series that airs in Luxembourg called Bits and Pieces. This is a reference to the working title of Liv and Maddie. == Series overview == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 9px;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Season ! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 9px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"padding:0 90px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Originally aired (U.S. dates) |- ! scope=\"col\" |First aired ! scope=\"col\" |Last aired |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#483D8B; color:#100; text-align:center;\"| | 1 | 21 | (preview) (premiere) | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#00CED1; color:#100; text-align:center;\"| | 2 | 24 | | http://tvschedule.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCProgram.do?sId=EP01751688&t;=Liv+and+Maddie&method;=getEpisodesForShow&epYear;=2 |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#98FB98; color:#100; text-align:center;\"| | 3 | 20 | | |- | scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#FBEC5D; color:#100; text-align:center;\"| | 4 | 15 | | |} == Cast and characters == === Main characters === * Dove Cameron as Liv and Maddie Rooney * Joey Bragg as Joey Rooney * Tenzing Norgay Trainor as Parker Rooney * Kali Rocha as Karen Rooney * Benjamin King as Pete Rooney (seasons 1â€“3) * Lauren Lindsey Donzis as Ruby (season 4) === Recurring characters === * Ryan McCartan as Diggie * Jessica Marie Garcia as Willow * Jimmy Bellinger as Artie * Kurt Long as Johnny Nimbus * Victoria Moroles as Andie * Carter Hastings as Evan * Jordan Fisher as Holden * Bridget Shergalis as Stains == Production == === Development === In the spring of 2012, Oops Doughnuts Productions had shopped the script of a project called Bits and Pieces. It was about a blended family similar to shows like The Brady Bunch and Step by Step. The show followed Jodie Sullenger (Kali Rocha), mother of Alanna (Dove Cameron) and Sticky (Joey Bragg). Sullenger married Pete Fickman (Benjamin King), father of Crystal (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and Brody (Tenzing Norgay Trainor). All six have to get used to life under the same roof. Eventually, Disney chose to change the concept of Bits and Pieces into one about a pair of twins. Now titled Liv and Maddie, the show began production in April 2013. The show was produced under a joint venture between Beck & Hart Productions, Oops Doughnuts Productions, and It's a Laugh Productions. The show's creators, John D. Beck and Ron Hart, are a production-writing team. Their credits include According to Jim, Hey Arnold!, and Shake It Up!. They also served as executive producers alongside Andy Fickman. Fickman was the only director who participated in all four seasons of the show. He directed 20 of the 21 episodes of the first season. He also directed four episodes of the second season, two of the third season, and four of the fourth season. On January 13, 2014, Disney Channel renewed Liv and Maddie for a 13-episode second season. The second season was later expanded to 24 episodes. The first season ended on July 27, 2014. The season season premiered on September 21, 2014. On April 3, 2015, the show was renewed for a third season by Disney Channel. The second season ended on August 23, 2015. The third season premiered on September 13, 2015. On December 21, 2015, Dove Cameron stated that Disney Channel was picking up Liv and Maddie for a fourth season.

The show ended on March 24, 2017. === Casting === Casting took place during the spring of 2012; however, only a pilot episode was made. Instead of hiring a new cast, production chose to keep those whom they had already hired and make a completely new pilot. The story now focused on Dove Cameron playing dual roles with the same parents and brothers. Lead billing for Cozi Zuehlsdorff was later dropped to guest star. The family name of \"Rooney\" was picked because of Sullenger's enjoyment of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team owned by the Rooney family. === Music === A full version of the Liv and Maddie theme song, \"Better in Stereo\", was recorded by Dove Cameron.
