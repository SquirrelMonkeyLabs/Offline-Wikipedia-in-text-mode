 "text": "The Yupik (in the Central Alaskan Yup'ik language, Yup'ik, plural Yupiit) people are a group of native people who mainly live in certain parts of Alaska, somewhere near Fairbanks. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed many of the indigenous people in Alaska. Many died during famines and the culture suffered when the Soviet government made villagers move. Some of the Yupi'k people's traditions are celebrating the dead. They celebrate by having ceremonies with a shaman, where they connect with the dead. They also name the next child born after the most recent person who has died. ==References== Category:Alaska Natives",
