 "text": "Nyctimystes ocreptus is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists found it on Mount Albert Edward, 2600 meters above sea level. Some may also live on Mount Victoria or Mount Knutsford. This frog has brown eyes. The veins in its lower eyelid go in all directions, like a net. This frog's skin is gold-green to gray-green in color. Its belly is white with purple and brown marks. Scientists say this frog is related to the common big-eyed tree frog, Nyctimystes narinosus. The name of this frog is from the words \"oculus in rete captus,\" which means \"eye caught in a net.\" ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
