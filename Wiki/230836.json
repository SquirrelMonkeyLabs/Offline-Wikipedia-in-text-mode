 "text": "Faggot (or fag) is an insulting term for a homosexual person. It is usually used to refer to gay men. Many people, especially homosexuals, see it as hate speech. Most prefer the term gay, or sometimes queer. Queer has been taken back for use by the LGBTQ+ community, even with the way the word has been used in the past. Younger people (including LGBT people) often use terms like \"gay,\" \"fag,\" \"faggot,\" and \"poofter\" as insults towards people that they don't like. ==References== Category:English profanity Category:Gay slang Category:Homophobia Category:Slurs",
