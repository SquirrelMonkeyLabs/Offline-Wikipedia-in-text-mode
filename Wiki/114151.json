It was divided in seven districts: Cérilly, Moulins, Le Donjon, Cusset, Gannat, Montmarault and Montluçon. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the seven districts were changed into four arrondissements: Moulins, Gannat, Lapalisse and Montluçon. On 10 September 1926, the arrondissement of Gannat was eliminated and in 1941 Vichy became the capital of one arrondissement of the department instead of Lapalisse. In 1940, during World War II, the city of Vichy was the capital of Vichy France. ==Geography== Allier is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. It has an area of .
