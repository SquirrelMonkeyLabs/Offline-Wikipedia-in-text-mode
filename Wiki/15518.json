The official languages of Uganda are English and Swahili. The most common religion is Christianity. The President of Uganda is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. The country is to the East of Africa. The population of Uganda is 32 million people. The area of Uganda is about 236,040 km2. Uganda produces coffee and copper. The literacy rate of Uganda is 68%, which mean people in Uganda who are at least 15 years old know how to read and write. Uganda is among countries thought to be very corrupt by Transparency International. It is rated at 2.4 on a scale from 0 (the most corrupt) to 10 (the most clean). Uganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. 37.7 percent of the people live on less than $1.25 a day. == History == Uganda, located in East Africa, has a rich history. It was home to ancient kingdoms like Buganda, Bunyoro, and Ankole. Colonial rule began with the arrival of the British in the late 19th century. Independence was achieved in 1962 under the leadership of Milton Obote. The country faced political instability, with Idi Amin's regime notorious for human rights abuses in the 1970s. Yoweri Museveni took power in 1986, bringing relative stability. Uganda has since experienced economic growth, though challenges like conflicts in the north have persisted. ==Geography== Uganda is almost completely in the Nile basin. At the centre of the country is Lake Kyoga. Although landlocked, Uganda has many large lakes. Besides Lake Victoria and Lake Kyoga, there are Lake Albert, Lake Edward and the smaller Lake George. Most important cities are in the south, near Lake Victoria, including the capital Kampala and the nearby city of Entebbe. The climate is mostly equatorial. But it is not the same everywhere because there are some changes in altitude. The difference in altitude changes the climate. Southern Uganda is wetter with rain generally throughout the year. At Entebbe on the northern shore of Lake Victoria, most rain falls from March to June and in the November/December period. Further to the north a dry season slowly emerges. At Gulu about 120 km from the South Sudanese border, November to February is much drier than the rest of the year. ==Cities== The largest cities in Uganda are: 25 Largest Cities in Uganda (2011 Estimates) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" Rank Name 2011 Population Estimate 1 Kampala 1,659,600 2 Kira 179,800 3 Gulu 154,300 4 Lira 108,600 5 Mbale 91,800 6 Nansana 89,900 7 Jinja 89,700 8 Mbarara 83,700 9 Entebbe 79,700 10 Kasese 74,300 11 Masaka 74,100 12 Soroti 66,000 13 Njeru 64,900 14 Kitgum 59,700 15 Arua 59,400 16 Mukono 59,000 17 Iganga 53,700 18 Koboko 51,300 19 Busia 47,100 20 Fort Portal 47,100 21 Kabale 44,600 22 Masindi 45,400 23 Tororo 43,700 24 Hoima 42,600 25 Mityana 39,300 ==Culture and sport== Because there are so many communities, culture in Uganda is diverse. Many Asians (mostly from India) who had to leave during the regime of Amin have returned to Uganda. Football is the national sport in Uganda.
