 "text": "Labu dan Labi () is a 1962 Singaporean Malay-language black-and-white buddy comedy film directed by and starring P. Ramlee. The movie was filmed in Singapore and tells the story of Labu and Labi, two servants with wild imaginations who work for a rich but stingy man named Haji Bakhil bin Haji Kedekut. The film is made like a stage pantomime, with exaggerated comedy and the characters sometimes talking directly to the audience. The film's sequel is Nasib Si Labu Labi. ==Related pages== * P.
