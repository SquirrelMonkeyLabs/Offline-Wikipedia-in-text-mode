 "text": "The Absence of good is a philosophical theory which considers evil to be a lack of something, rather than a object, or entity, like good is. This means that everything in the universe is usually good, and the lack of it is what we call evil. It is applied to the problem of evil, in that if some things in the world are admitted to be evil, this could show that the creator (or God) isn't completely good. Category:Philosophical concepts",
