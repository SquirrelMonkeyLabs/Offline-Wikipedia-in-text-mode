 "text": "The Osteocephalus deridens is a frog in the family Hylidae. It lives in Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. Scientists have seen it between 250 and 600 meters above sea level. The adult male frog is 28.8–34.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 43.7–50.6 mm long. This is a medium- sized frog the color of coffee (brown). It has a cream-colored (white) mark under each eye. The belly is cream-white. The bones of the feet are green in color, and a human can see them through the skin. This frog moves at night. The male frogs sit on bromeliad plants about 5 m above the ground and sing. They live in forests with firm ground. The female frog lays eggs in bromeliad plants. Scientists think she comes back to the same plant and lays more eggs for the tadpoles to eat. Scientists gave this frog the name deridere for the Latin word for \"laughing\" because the male frogs sound as if they are laughing. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
