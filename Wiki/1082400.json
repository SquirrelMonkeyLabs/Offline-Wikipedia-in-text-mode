 "text": "A historical writing system called Anga Lipi existed. The Buddhist scripture \"Lalitvistar\" mentions the Anga Lipi, stating that it was one of the 64 scripts that Lord Buddha was aware of. == History and Etymology == An old Sanskrit Buddhist text called the \"Lalitvistar\" makes reference to the Anga Script and lists Anga Lipi very early among the 64 scripts that the Buddha is known to have known. While some of the sixty-four letters listed in \"Lalitvistar\" were believed to be legendary by Arthur Coke Burnell, he believed that several, such as Dravid, Anga, and Banga, were real despite not emerging as separate alphabets until the ninth or tenth century CE.[3] (Burnell considered this section to be an afterthought.) == Qualities and contrast == Bengali and Anga Lipi scripts may have sprung from Brahmic, but with certain regional traits.This lends credence to the theory that local traits were still being developed in alphabets from previous times It shows how regional variations of Indian alphabets were first developed. == Relationship with Angika == It is said to be the ancient writing system or script for Angika which was than known by its historical name Aangi. Various sources were gathered by Archaelogical Survey of India (ASI) during excavation in Banka and Bhagalpur. == References == Category:Writing systems",
