So it was the first Mickey Mouse film made but the fourth one shown. == Plot == At a farm, a mouse named Mickey wants to be like Charles Lindbergh so he builds an airplane but it falls apart so Mickey builds a second plane out of a car and accidentally hits a cow with it. A female mouse named Minnie gives Micky a horseshoe for good luck so Micky brings her on the plane with him. Micky tries to kiss Minnie but she won’t let him so Micky starts driving the plane at a very high speed and she falls out and Micky takes her back into the plane. Minnie doesn’t want to kiss Micky but Micky kisses her anyway so she slaps him in the face. Minnie jumps out of the plane and uses her bloomers as a parachute. Mickey’s plane falls apart and Mickey lands on the ground. Mickey sees Minnie and laughs at her so she leaves. Mickey angrily throws the horseshoe in the air but then it hits him in the head. == Influence == After Plane Crazy, Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks made The Gallopin Gaucho and then Steamboat Willie. ==References== Category:1928 movies Category:Disney movies Category:Silent movies",
