 "text": "The national flag of the Republic of Ireland () is a tricolour vertical flag of green, white, and orange. It is also known as the Irish tricolour. The flag proportion is 1:2 (length twice the width). To unionists it is frequently seen as antagonistic to their history and culture. Its meaning is not explained in the Irish Constitution, but the Irish government has stated that: * the green represents the Gaelic (catholic) tradition of Ireland; * the orange represents the followers of William of Orange in Ireland who were supporters of the Protestant Anglo-Irish loyalist tradition. * and the white represents the hope of peace, or a truce, between them.Taoiseach.gov.ie'National Flag' Department of the Taoiseach \"Youth Zone\" web page. ==References== Ireland Category:National symbols of the Republic of Ireland",
