 "text": "Halidon Hill is a mountain located approximately 2 miles (3 kilometers) west of Berwick-upon-Tweed, on the boundary between England and Scotland. It stands 600 feet (180 meters) tall. The hill's name implies that it formerly had a fortress on its top. At the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, Edward III of England defeated a Scottish force headed by Archibald the \"Tyneman\" Douglas, Regent of Scotland, with longbowmen on the hill's crest.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 5 (London, 1894), p. 192: William Acres, Letters of Lord Burleigh to his son Robert Cecil (Cambridge, 2017), p. 171.Thomas Thomson, James Melville, Memoirs of his own life (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 173. ==References== ==Other websites== *English Heritage: Battle of Halidon Hill *GOOGLE book: \"Halidon hill: a dramatic sketch from Scottish history\" by Sir Walter Scott Category:Geography of Northumberland Category:Hills of the United Kingdom",
