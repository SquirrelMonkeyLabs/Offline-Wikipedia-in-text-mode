 "text": "Walleye (Sander vitreus) is a freshwater perciform fish native to most of Canada and to the northern United States. It is a North American close relative of the European pikeperch. The walleye is sometimes also called the yellow walleye to distinguish it from the blue walleye, which is an extinct subspecies formerly found in the southern Great Lakes. == References == * * Boyd Huppert (December 7, 2004). \"Walleye or Zander?
