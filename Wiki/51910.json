 "text": "Worship is a word often used in religion. It means to have much respect. If someone prays or gives thanks to God, people say that they are worshipping God. Worship can also be used as the name for a church service or similar event. This can be called an act of worship. An act of worship can be performed as a simple prayer or through an elaborate ceremony. It can be performed individually or in an informal or formal group. The Bible talks about many people worshipping God, for example Abraham builds an altar in Genesis 12:8. In Christianity, worship is the act of giving reverent honor and homage to God. Collective Christian worship is liturgical, characterized by prayers and hymns, with texts from the Bible. It is centered on the Eucharist, sacramental and ceremonial worship. As evidenced in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, worship together with adoration, prayer, and accomplishment of the promises and vows made to God are acts of the virtue of religion which fall under obedience to the first commandment.http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2135.htm The Quran talks about worshipping Allah. ==References==",
