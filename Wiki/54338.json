 "text": "Sussex is a historic county in South East England. Its area is more or less the same as that of the ancient Kingdom of Sussex. It is divided for local government into West Sussex and East Sussex and the City of Brighton and Hove. The city of Brighton and Hove became a unitary authority in 1997; and got City status in 2000. Until then Chichester had been Sussex's only city. Sussex still has a strong local identity and the county's unofficial anthem is Sussex by the Sea. The county's motto, \"We wun't be druv\", shows the strong-willed nature of its people in past centuries. ==Towns and cities== Major towns and cities of Sussex include: *Arundel *Bognor Regis *Brighton (home of the University of Sussex and the University of Brighton) *Burgess Hill *Chichester (home of the University of Chichester) *Crawley *Eastbourne *East Grinstead *Hastings *Haywards Heath *Horsham *Lewes *Littlehampton *Midhurst *Worthing == Further reading == *\"Angels in the Sussex Air\", an anthology of poetry by Sussex authors chosen and edited by Patrick Garland, *\"An Historical Atlas of Sussex\", An Atlas of the History of the Counties of East and West Sussex, edited by Kim Leslie and Brian Short, with maps by Susan Rowland, published by Phillimore & Co.
