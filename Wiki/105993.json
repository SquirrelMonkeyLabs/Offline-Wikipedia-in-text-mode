 "text": "The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was started by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The CCC gave young men jobs such as fighting forest fires, digging ditches, and planting trees. The CCC paid these men about thirty dollars a month. At first, it was planned to get men out of the cities, but more men came from small towns and rural areas. == Other websites == * TripleCCC Museum in St. Louis, Missouri Category:20th century in the United States Category:Franklin D.
