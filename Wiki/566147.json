 "text": "A halal snack pack, or HSP, is a dish that comes from Australia. It is made up of halal-certified doner kebab meat (mainly lamb, chicken or beef), chips, sauces (mainly chili, garlic and barbecue sauces) and often cheese. The exact origin of the halal snack pack is unknown. Halal snack packs have become more popular since 2015, when the Facebook group \"Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society\" was created. ==References== Category:Fast food Category:Australian food",
