 "text": "A budget airline or low-cost carrier is an airline which tries to keep its prices and fares lower than competitors. It usually does this by not offering services like free food and drink on a flight and keeping fines from airports low by keeping on time. They also usually only use one type of aircraft. Budget airlines were made famous by Southwest Airlines in the USA which only use a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft.",
