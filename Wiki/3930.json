The South Saskatchewan River flows through the centre of the city, and many people enjoy boating, biking, and walking in the area. The University of Saskatchewan is also in Saskatoon. The name Saskatoon [in Cree: sâskwatôn, \"Saskatoon\"] comes from the Cree inanimate noun misâskwatômina \"saskatoon berries,\" which refers to the sweet violet-coloured berry that grows in the area. == Media == Radio stations include commercial stations CKOM-AM 650 kHz (“650 CKOM” News/Talk), CFMC-FM 95.1 MHz (“C95” Hot AC), CJDJ-FM 102.1 MHz (“Rock 102” Active Rock), CJWW- AM 600kHz (“Country 600” Country), CKBL-FM 92.9 MHz (“92.9 The Bull” Country), CJMK-FM 98.3 MHz (“98 Cool FM” Classic Hits), CFWD-FM 96.3 MHz (“96.3 Cruz FM” - Mainstream Rock) ==References==",
