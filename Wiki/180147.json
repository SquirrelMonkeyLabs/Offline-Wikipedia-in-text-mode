 "text": "Troll 2 is a 1990 horror comedy movie, directed by Claudio Fragasso, under the pseudonym Drake Floyd. During production, the movie was known as Goblins, and some countries released the movie under that name. However, when it was released in the United States, the title was changed to Troll 2 in an attempt to help connect it to an existing horror movie, Troll. The two movies do not have sny connection besides the title. In fact, there are not even any trolls in Troll 2. This movie has a sequel, Troll 3. ==Plot== A family goes on vacation to the tiny town of Nilbog, where everyone is actually a goblin. The goblins are vegetarians who turn people into plants to eat them. The family’s young son is the only one who realizes the truth about Nilbog and must defeat the goblins with the help of the ghost of his grandfather. ==Reception== The film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, only 5% of reviews were good. The site’s critical consensus is simply “oh my god”, a reference to an iconic scene in the film where a character screams that line.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/troll-2/ The film is so infamous that a documentary called Best Worst Movie was made about it by the original child star.http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18504 ==References== Category:English-language movies Category:1990 horror movies Category:1990 comedy movies Category:American horror movies Category:American comedy movies Category:Italian horror movies",
