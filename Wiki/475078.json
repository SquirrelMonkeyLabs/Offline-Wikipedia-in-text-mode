Clement was known for expanding the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, beginning the construction of the Trevi Fountain, and buying Cardinal Alessandro Albani's collection of art for the papal gallery. His first moves as Pope Clement XII were to give back the papal finances. Clement XII died on 6 February 1740 from problems caused by gout. His remains were transferred to his tomb in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 20 July 1742. ==References== Category:Italian popes Category:1652 births Category:1740 deaths",
