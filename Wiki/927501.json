 "text": "The reverse of a number is a mathematical method to obtain from a number another written in the opposite way to the first. For example, the reverse of 1234 is 4321. == Method == Given a positive integer x, the integer which has the same digits in the reverse order is: 10^{\\lfloor\\log_{10}x\\rfloor}x-99\\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor\\log_{10}x\\rfloor}{\\lfloor 10^{-k}x\\rfloor}10^{\\lfloor\\log_{10}x\\rfloor-k} == Applications == Obtaining the reverse of a number is useful to predict if a number is Lychrel or not. == References == Category:Number theory",
