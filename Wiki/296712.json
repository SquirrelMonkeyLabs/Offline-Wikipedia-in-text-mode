 "text": "Absorption is when something takes in another substance. It is a physical or chemical phenomenon or process.Such as diffusion, for example. Atoms, molecules, or ions enter in the inner part (called \"bulk\") of a gas, liquid, or solid material. This is different from adsorption. Molecules undergoing absorption are going deep into the volume of the material, instead in the case of adsorption molecules stop at the surface of the material. A more general term is sorption, which covers absorption, adsorption, and ion exchange. Other meanings of \"absorption\" are: * Biology: entry of substances through the skin or other boundaries such as the intestine or cell membrane. * Pharmacology: release of drugs into the blood. * Physics: receiving of electromagnetic radiation by a material. == Notes == Category:Physical chemistry",
