 "text": "Extradition is how someone who has committed a crime, or is suspected to have committed a crime, is handed from one jurisdiction to another. Usually, the country that wants the person makes a formal request to the other. Under international law, there is no obligation to extradite a person. There is a web of treaties, which state under what conditions extradition is possible. In general: * The offense for which the person is sought must be punishable in both countries, usually it must also carry a minimum sentence. * The person extradited has the right to get a fair trial. * The trial must not be political in nature. * Many countries refuse extradition if there is the possibility of the death penalty being imposed, or of torture. * Many countries refuse to extradite their own nationals People who move to a different location to escape legal charges are called fugitives. ==Examples== In 2019 protestors in Hong Kong demonstrated against a new extradition law proposed by the government of mainland China. ==References== Category:International law",
