 "text": "Burmese tofu is a food made from water and chickpea flour. Unlike regular tofu, it does not have soy in it. To make it, water, chickpea flour, turmeric, and salt are mixed. This mixture is then heated up until it looks and feels like cream. After that it is allowed to cool down and get hard. It came from the Shan people of Burma.
