He spent his entire NHL career with the Vancouver Canucks playing alongside his identical twin brother Daniel. He served as the captain of the Canucks from 2010 until 2018. The Sedins were known for the way in which they helped each other play. Henrik, a good passer, was known to help set up goals, while Daniel was known to score goals. Henrik started his career in the Swedish Elite League with Modo Hockey in 1997 and won the Golden Puck as Swedish player of the year in 1999, winning it with Daniel. He was picked third by the Canucks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. Henrik has played his entire NHL career in Vancouver and has led the team in scoring the past six seasons, from 2007–08 to 2012-2013. In 2009–10, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's top point scorer, setting Canucks' records for assists and points in a season as well as the team record for career assists. Henrik also won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player for the 2009-10 season. Internationally, Henrik has played for Sweden and won a gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, as well as two bronze medals at the 1999 and 2001 World Championships. On April 5, 2018, the Sedin twins played their last game in Rogers Arena against the Arizona Coyotes. Henrik played his last game on April 7, 2018 and retired alongside his brother after the 2017–18 NHL season. The Sedins both won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy at the end of the season, making it the first time two brothers shared the trophy. On February 12, 2020, a ceremony took place which celebrated the Sedins' career. During the event, Henrik's jersey number 33 and Daniel's number 22 were retired and raised to the rafters of Rogers Arena.
