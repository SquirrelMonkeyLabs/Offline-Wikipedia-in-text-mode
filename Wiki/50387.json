 "text": "Ghost lights are lights in the air that are not well understood by scientists. There are few reports of ghost light sightings. Ghost lights can be close to ground or in the sky. Ghost lights close to ground are commonly called \"will o' the wisp\" while ghost lights in the sky are often called UFOs. There are very different kinds of ghost lights: some resemble balls of light, others look like flame, and some look like a bright cloud. Many ghost lights move. Different cultures have understood ghost lights differently. People believed that they are dragons, spirits or ghosts. Today some believe they are spaceships. There are many theories about what ghost lights are. Some people say they are methane gas that comes from ground and burns in the air. Others say they are electric things like ball lightning. The fact that some animals and fungus glows may explain some ghost lights. ==Examples== These are examples of known ghost lights at different places: * Australia ** Min Min lights *Finland **Paasselk√§ devil * Norway ** Hessdalen light * Canada ** Baie Chaleur Fireship ** St. Louis Light * Sweden ** Martebo lights * Thailand ** Mekong lights (Nekha lights) *Italia **Fuoco Fatuo * United States ** Arkansas *** Crossett Light *** Gurdon Light ** North Carolina *** Brown Mountain Lights *** Maco light ** Georgia *** Surrency Spooklight ** Indiana *** Moody's Light ** Michigan Upper Peninsula *** The Paulding Light ** Missouri *** Hornet ghost light *** Ozark Spooklight ** Oklahoma *** Spooklight (same as Hornet ghost light, at the Oklahoma-Missouri line) ** Texas *** Bragg Road ghost light ( Light of Saratoga ) *** Marfa lights ** Utah *** Skinwalker Ranch ** Virginia *** Cohoke light Category:Folklore Category:Light",
