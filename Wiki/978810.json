 "text": "\"Me Against The Music\" is a 2003 single. It is by pop music singer Britney Spears. It is also the first one from the album In the Zone in October 2003. It features American singer and entertainer Madonna. ==Background== \"Me Against The Music\" is different from any previous singles released by Spears in a number of ways. For one, this became her first to have co-writing and co- producing credits from herself (along with many others, inlcuding Madonna whom is also featured on vocals for the song). Secondly, this is truly her first single away from the bubble-gum pop and security of producer Max Martin; It is even more independent than her previous tracks produced by The Neptunes in that this song takes in multiple talents and collaborations, and not just those of a single team. ==Chart success== After a long run of US flops, \"Me Against the Music\" became Spears' first single since 2001's \"I'm A Slave 4 U\". That was to achieve considerable success (possibly due to the presence of Madonna). While a modest top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, the song became a huge dance success. It topped both the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and Hot Dance Singles Sales charts. The track also went top 20 on both the Top 40 Mainstream and Top 40 Tracks charts. Internationally, the song was a massive hit. It peaked at #2 in both the UK and Canada and #1 in Australia.
