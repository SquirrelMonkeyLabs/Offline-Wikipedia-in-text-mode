He has worked for Shivaji Maharaj and Sambhaji Maharaj. His sister Soyrabai later married Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, which made Mohite as Shivaji's brother- in-law. ==Millitary Career== On January 30, 1681, Hambirrao Mohite and Chhatrapati Sambhaji attacked Burhanpur, a major trade center, where Jehan Khan was the Mughal Subahdar. With only 200 soldiers, the Mughal garrison was unable to resist Hambirraoâ€™s 20,000-strong army, leading to significant Mughal losses and the Marathas seizing assets worth over 1 crore rupees. On March 17, 1683, Hambirrao defeated Mughal commander Ranamast Khan in the Battle of Kalyan-Bhiwandi. In 1687, he won another victory against Sarja Khan in the Battle of Wai, but was fatally wounded by a cannonball during the clash. ==References== Category:1630 births Category:1687 deaths Category:Marathi people Category:Indian military people",
