 "text": "The Negro Leagues were baseball leagues for African Americans. These leagues started in the 1880s because African Americans were not allowed into the major leagues. Some of the best players in the Negro Leagues were Satchel Paige, Oscar Charleston, Josh Gibson, and John Henry Lloyd. In 1945 Jackie Robinson was the first African American to join the major leagues in the 20th century. By the 1960s the Negro Leagues had broken up. == References == Category:African-American history Category:Baseball leagues Category:History of baseball",
