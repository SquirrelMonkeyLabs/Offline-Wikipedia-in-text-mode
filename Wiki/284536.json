 "text": "David Baltimore (born March 7, 1938 in New York City) is an American biologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 for discovering reverse transcriptase. He shared the prize with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. The discovery of reverse transcriptase was made at the same time as Howard Temin. It overturned the central dogma of molecular biology because it showed that genetic information could traffic both ways between DNA and RNA. They published these findings in back-to-back papers in the journal, Nature. He was elected a foreign member of the Academia Europaea in 1999. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Scientists from New York City Category:American Nobel Prize winners Category:American virologists Category:Members of Academia Europaea",
