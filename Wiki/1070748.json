 "text": "Rebecca was a woman in the Book of Genesis. She was the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban. Rebecca married Isaac. She and Isaac prayed to God to have a child. Then Rebecca became pregnant. She wanted to know why it was painful and God told her that she would give birth to twins who would become two nations that would fight each other. She gave birth to Esau and Jacob. She convinced Jacob to trick Isaac into blessing him instead of Esau so Esau decided to kill Jacob. So Rebecca told Jacob to run away to Laban and she told Isaac she was sending him away so he wouldn't marry a Canaanite woman. Category:Biblical people",
