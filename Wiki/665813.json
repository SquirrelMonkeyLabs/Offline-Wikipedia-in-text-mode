 "text": "A pastel is an art color in the form of a stick. It is made of pure powdered pigment and a 'binder' which holds it together. Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all kinds of colored art. The effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.Mayer, Ralph. 1991. The Artist's Handbook of materials and techniques. Viking, 5th revised edition. Chalk may be added to the pastel to tone down the more vivd colors.Wilson S. & Lack J. 2008. The Tate guide to modern art terms. London: Tate.
