 "text": "Tropical Storm Erika in August 2015 was a very damaging and deadly tropical cyclone. The storm struck the Leeward Islands on August 27. More than USD$500 million in damage was caused by the storm. More than 30 people died when the storm passed through the Caribbean. Resulting from Erika's impact over the northeast Caribbean, the name Erika was retired in April 2016. The name was replaced with Elsa for 2021. Erika became the second storm name that was retired. Allison was the first one. ==References== Category:2015 in weather Category:Atlantic tropical storms Category:Hurricanes in the United States Category:August 2015 events Category:2015 in North America Category:2010s in Florida Category:2010s in the Bahamas Category:Retired tropical cyclone names",
