 "text": "The Manu poison frog (Ameerega macero) is a frog. It lives in Peru and Brazil. ==Home== This frog lives in forests, especially bamboo forests. Scientists saw the frog between 300 and 1450 meters above sea level. Some of the places the frog lives are protected places: Parque Nacional Otishi, Parque Nacional Manu, Manu Learning Centre, Manu Wildlife Center, Estaci칩n Biol칩gica Cocha Cashu, Machiguenga Communal Reserve, Amarakaeri Communal Reserve, Parque Nacional da Serra do Divisor, Reserva Extrativista do Alto Juru치, Reserva Extrativista Riozinho da Liberdade, and Reserva Extrativista do Rio Greg칩rio. ==Young== The female frog lays eggs on dead leaves on the ground. After the eggs hatch, the adult frogs carry the tadpoles to streams that move slowly, where they swim and grow. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out. Humans change the places where the frog lives. People cut down forests to make farms and places for animals to eat grass. People also catch this frog to sell as a pet, even though this is against the law. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
