 "text": "A student teacher, sometimes called a practice teacher, is a student in college, university, or graduate school who is learning to become a teacher. They do this by teaching in a real classroom, but they are always supervised by a certified teacher. This experience helps them get their degree in education. Sometimes, people use the term \"pre-service teacher\" to mean the same thing. It's a broader term that includes students who are studying how to teach and also learning about their specific subject, but they haven't started teaching in a real classroom yet. In many schools, \"pre-service teacher\" is the official title for all students studying to become teachers. For most teaching jobs, you need to complete student teaching to get your teaching credentials.Student teacher. WordNet 3.0. Princeton University.
