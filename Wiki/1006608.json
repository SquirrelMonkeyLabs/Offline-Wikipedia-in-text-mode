It is located in the area known as Suerokoku, which is believed to be the first land of the mainland of Wakoku as per Wajinden records. It is an important point for safe sea crossings to the continent, and has received significant orders from the central government since ancient times. In earlier times, it was called 'Tajima Niimasu Kaminoyashiro'. It is the only Myojin Taisha in Hizen Province, and was previously classified as Kokuhei Chusha due to renovations during the Meiji period. Currently, it is a beppyo shrine of the Association of Shinto Shrines. It is associated with Sayohime Matsuura, whose poem was written by Okura Yamanoue, and is said to be the original shrine (roots) of Munakata Taisha.『田島神の創祀と宗像神との関係について』 江永次男 昭和62年 == References == Category:Beppyo shrines Category:Kokuhei Chūsha Category:Myōjin Taisha Category:Shinto shrines in Saga Prefecture",
