 "text": "Parts per million is a unit which expresses a small amount of dimensionless quantities. Proportionally, parts per million represents one thousandth of a millilitre of something per litre of water, or one milligram of something per kilogram of soil. Just as per cent means out of a hundred, so parts per million or ppm means out of a million. Usually describes the concentration of something in water or soil. One ppm is equivalent to 0.001 milli-litre of something per litre of water (ml/l) or 1 milli-gram of something per kilogram soil (mg/kg). It is generally used for diluting solutions, when using molarity would be extremely difficult for the scientist. Category:Chemical nomenclature Category:Units of measurement == References ==",
