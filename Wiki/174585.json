Graphs of six convex regular 4-polytope. In geometry, a polychoron (plural: polychora) is a figure in four dimensions. The word comes from Greek poly, which means many and choros which means room, or space. Sometimes the figure is called 4-polytope or polyhedroid. The analogue figure in two dimensions is a polygon, and the one in three dimensions is a polyhedron. ==Other websites== * *Four dimensional figures page *Jonathan Bowers: Uniform polychora Category:Shapes",
