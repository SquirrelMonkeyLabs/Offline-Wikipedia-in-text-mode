For the Canadian television channel that was previously known as Disney XD, see WildBrainTV. History A Canadian version of Disney XD was originally launched by Astral Media on June 1, 2011, as a spin-off of Family Channel, which had historically held rights to the programming of Disney Channel and its spin-off brands. After Bell Media acquired Astral in 2013, the company sold Disney XD along with its sister channels (Family Channel and the French and English versions of Disney Junior) to DHX Media. On April 16, 2015, Corus Entertainment announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Canadian rights to Disney Channel programming and brands. Disney XD programming initially aired in a programming block on the Canadian version of Disney Channel, which Corus launched on September 1, 2015. The Disney XD-branded channel owned by DHX was renamed Family Chrgd on October 9, 2015, then again to its current moniker on March 1, 2022. The new Corus-owned Disney XD channel launched on December 1, 2015, as an exempt discretionary service. On September 1, 2017, the channel obtained a discretionary service license from the CRTC. Through Corus Entertainment's acquisition of Shaw Media, Disney XD and its sister networks are now co-owned with the former Shaw Media channels as of April 1, 2016. ==Programming== ===Animated Series=== Title Premiere date Source(s) Big Hero 6: The Series November 20, 2017; September 2018 – present DuckTales August 12, 2017 – present Gravity Falls December 1, 2015 – 2019; September 1, 2020 - present Guardians of the Galaxy December 1, 2015 – present Marvel's Spider-Man August 19, 2017 – present Milo Murphy's Law October 17, 2016 – present Star vs. The Forces of Evil December 1, 2015 – present ===Live-action=== Title Premiere date Current season Source(s) Gamer's Guide to Pretty Much Everything December 1, 2015 Kickin' It December 1, 2015 Lab Rats December 1, 2015 Mighty Med December 1, 2015 ===Acquired animated series=== Title Premiere date Source(s) Beyblade Burst October 2, 2016 – present ===Reruns of acquired animated series=== Title Premiere date Source(s) Bravest Warriors November 1, 2020 – present Counterfeit Cat September 1, 2018 – present Detentionaire August 27, 2017 – September 1, 2018; September 7, 2019 – present Grossology December 1, 2015 – present Oh No!
