 "text": "The Arctic Cathedral, also known as Tromsdalen Church, is a church in Tromsø Municipality in Norway. It is a part of the Tromsøysund parish and is managed by the Tromsø domprosti, which is responsible for a group of churches in the area. The church is also under the authority of the Diocese of Nord- Hålogaland. The church was built in a long church style in 1965 using plans drawn up by architect Jan Inge Hovig. The church is made mainly of concrete and metal, and it has a seating capacity of approximately 600 people. The church was built by Ing. F. Selmer A/S Tromsø as the main contractor for the construction. Despite being nicknamed the Ishavskatedralen or \"The Cathedral of the Arctic Sea\", it is important to note that the church is not a cathedral, but a parish church. == Design == The church is notable for its design and is one of the most notable churches in Tromsø. Tromsø has other notable churches, including the Protestant Tromsø Cathedral, which is the only wooden cathedral in Norway, and the Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady, Tromsø. === History === The church was consecrated on 19 November 1965 by Bishop Monrad Norderval. The church is made out of cast-in-place aluminum-coated concrete panels and has a glass mosaic on the eastern side, made by Victor Sparre in 1972. The church acquired a new organ built by Grönlunds Orgelbyggeri in 2005 to replace the old organ delivered by Vestlandske Orgelverksted, Hareid in 1965. ==References== Category:Churches in Norway Category:Buildings and structures in Tromsø",
