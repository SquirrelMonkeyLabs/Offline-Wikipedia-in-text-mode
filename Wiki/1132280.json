 "text": "The aortic valve is a valve in the heart of humans and most other animals. It is located between the left ventricle and the aorta. It is one of the four valves of the heart and one of the two semilunar valves, the other being the pulmonary valve. The aortic valve normally has three leaflets, although in 1â€“2% of the population it is found to congenitally have two leaflets. The aortic valve is the last structure in the heart the blood travels through before stopping the flow through the systemic circulation. ==References== Category:Cardiovascular system Category:Heart Category:Anatomy of the cardiovascular system Category:Cardiology",
