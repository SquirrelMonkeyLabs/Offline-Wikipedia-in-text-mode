Held by the Croatian Defense Council (Hrvatsko vijeÄ‡e obrane, or HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine, or ARBiH), the operation's objective was to destroy a salient surrounding the town of Jajce in central Bosnia. There were multiple significant VRS offensive operations interspersed with relative lulls in fighting, and the level of ferocity of the conflict varied greatly. Following the VRS's conquest of Jajce on October 29, 1992, all of the town's mosques and Roman Catholic churches were destroyed.",
