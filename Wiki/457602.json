Major General Philip Sheridan, who commanded the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac, wanted to launch a raid behind the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. He thought he could keep supplies from reaching the Confederates and defeat the Confederate cavalry, commanded by Major General J.E.B. Stuart. == Battle == Sheridan started his raid on May 9. Stuart started after him right away. On May 11, they fought on May 11 at Yellow Tavern, six miles north of Richmond. The Confederates defeated several Union attacks. But in the afternoon, General George A. Custer's Michigan Brigade broke through the Confederate center. Near the end of the battle Stuart was mortally wounded by one of Custer's men and died the next day.Paul D. Walker, The Cavalry Battle that Saved the Union: Custer Vs. Stuart at Gettysburg (Gretna, LA: Pelican Publishing Co., 2002), p. 144 The Confederates then retreated from the battlefield. The battle, except for Stuart's death, was not of much note.John S. Salmon, The Official Virginia Civil War Battlefield Guide (Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 2001), p. 255 There were a total of about 800 casualties. ==References== Category:American Civil War battles Category:May events Category:1864 events Category:1864 in Virginia",
