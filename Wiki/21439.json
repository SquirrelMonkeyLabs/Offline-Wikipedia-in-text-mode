 "text": "Unemployment or joblessness is when a person who is of normal working age (usually about 15-18 to about 60-65) does not have a paid job. They therefore do not get paid a salary. It is one of social issues and human rights violations. In some parts of the world, there are social networks to care for the unemployed. == Overview == The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people divided by the total population of that age group of a country. The unemployment rate is influenced by many things, including the government of a country to the average age of a country's population. Unemployment is a bad thing for society. A certain amount of unemployment is natural. 'Full employment' does not mean no-one is out of work. Governments now aim to increase the number of jobs (which can be done) rather than cut out all unemployment (which cannot be done).Tom de Castella & Caroline McClatchey 2011. Whatever happened to full employment? BBC News magazine == Most affected groups == People with Autism and other mental disabilities are mistreated in the workplace, leading to only around 15% of autistic people being employed at all. ==Invisible unemployment== Discouraged workers are the number of people who do not have work but who are not counted in government reports. For example, people who have stopped looking for a job. The underemployed are people who work less than they want to do, or people who are overqualified for their job. == References == Category:Employment Category:Social issues",
