 "text": "A centrifuge is a device with a motor in it, which is used to spin an object with high speed. This high speed spinning forces the object outwards. This force is used for several purposes: * a uranium centrifuge is used to separate two isotopes of uranium (named U-235 and U-238) from each other; * in medical laboratories, serum is separated from the blood samples using a centrifuge; * in chemical laboratories, centrifuges are used to subtract solid parts of an emulsion from its liquid parts. * large centrifuges are used by NASA to expose astronauts to high forces for their training. == References == Category:Laboratory equipment",
