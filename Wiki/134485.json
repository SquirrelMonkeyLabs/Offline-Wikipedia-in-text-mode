 "text": "Stoicism was a school of Hellenistic philosophy. It was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early third century BC. It concerns the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom. This philosophy claims that it is virtuous to maintain a will (a determination, prohairesis) which is according to the participants \"in accord with nature\". Stoic doctrine was popular in Greece and the Roman Empire from its founding until all the schools of philosophy were ordered closed in 529 AD by the Emperor Justinian I, who thought their pagan character was at odds with his Christian faith.Agathias, Histories, 2.31. == Stoic philosophers == * Antipater of Tarsus (210 BC129 BC) * Cato the Younger (Uticensis 94 BC46 BC) * Chrysippus (280 BC204 BC) * Cleanthes (of Assos), (330 BC232 BC) * Diodotus, (~120 BC59 BC), teacher of Cicero * Diogenes of Babylon (230 BC150 BC) * Epictetus (55 AD135 AD) * Hierocles (2nd century AD) * Marcus Aurelius (121 AD180 AD) * Musonius Rufus (25 AD100AD) * Panaetius of Rhodes (185 BC109 BC) * Posidonius of Apameia (~135 BC51 BC) * Seneca (4 BC65 AD) ** Contemporaries: Musonius Rufus, Rubellius Plautus, Thrasea Paetus * Zeno of Citium (332 BC262 BC), founder of Stoicism ** Contemporaries: Aristo of Chios, pupil of Zeno; Herillus of Carthage == References == Category:Philosophical movements and positions",
