 "text": "Marcel Schmelzer (born 22 January 1988) is a former German football player. He has played for Borussia Dortmund and the Germany national team. ==Biography== Trained at Borussia Dortmund, Marcel Schmelzer made his debut with the reserve team in Regionalliga Nord in 2007. A year later, he made his professional debut in the Bundesliga at the age of 20, replacing the Brazilian Dedê, who was the regular starter on the left side of the defense. He only played in 12 matches during his first professional season, but in the following season, 2009–10, he firmly established himself as the left-back, quickly gaining recognition for his work rate on the field. He truly broke out during the 2010-11 season when he became one of the best in his position in the Bundesliga and won the German championship with his club Borussia Dortmund. The following season, he won the German championship for a second consecutive time as well as the German Cup. Although he was included in Joachim Löw's German national team for Euro 2012, he didn't play any matches in the tournament, which ended with a 2-1 defeat in the semi-finals against Italy. In 2012-2013, Borussia Dortmund couldn't compete with Bayern Munich in the league, and they also lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the final of a UEFA Champions League, a unique all-German club showdown. During the 2013-2014 season, Schmelzer suffered several injuries that caused him to miss many matches. Due to a knee injury, Schmelzer has been sidelined since June 2020 and missed the entire 2020-21 season, not playing any matches. Despite being out of contract after a year on the sidelines, Schmelzer signed a one-year extension with his club in July 2021, even though he is still in the rehabilitation process. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League DFB-Pokal Continental Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Borussia Dortmund II 2005–06 Oberliga Westfalen 1 0 — — — 1 0 2007–08 Regionalliga Nord 26 0 — — — 26 0 2008–09 Regionalliga West 10 0 — — — 10 0 2009–10 3.
