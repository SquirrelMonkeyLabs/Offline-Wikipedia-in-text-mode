 "text": "Carving is the act of using tools to shape a material by scraping away portions of that material. It can be done on any material solid enough to hold a shape, yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with tools. Examples of material with potential for carving: # Wood # Stone # Brick # Plaster (when dry; but usually moulded when moist) # Bone Carving is different from methods using soft and malleable materials like clay and melted glass. Carving needs more work.Daniel Marcus Mendelowitz 1953.
