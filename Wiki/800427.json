It had three episodes aired on Spike TV in 2003 but the last three episodes were unaired until a DVD release. It was much more vulgar than the original show and used constant gross-out and sex jokes. == Reception == The adult-oriented cartoon is seen as a major step down from the original cartoon. The pacing of each episode wasn't liked either. ==Production== Spike TV offered John Kricfalusi to have not only reruns of the original show but also new adult-oriented episodes. Billy West was considered to return as the voice of Stimpy, but he declined due to Kricfalusi's involvement. Eric Bauza would voice Stimpy.
