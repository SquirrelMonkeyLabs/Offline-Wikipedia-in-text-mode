 "text": "An unfinished building is a building that was being built, but was either abandoned or is on hold. There are many different reasons why buildings have not been completed. One of the biggest reasons for unfinished buildings, is when the money runs out. The National Monument in Scotland was planned to be a War Memorial for soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars. Building started in 1826, but the money ran out in 1829. The Sagrada Família, a church in Barcelona, Spain, was started in 1882 and is still not finished. It is not finished because the architect, Antoni Gaudí, who died in 1926 after he was hit by a tram, did not leave many plans for the building. What was left was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. The war also meant that there was not enough money to complete the project. == Some examples == * Duomo di Siena, Sienna, Italy * Goodwood House, West Sussex, England * Herrenchiemsee, Bavaria, Germany * Szkieletor, Kraków, Poland * Woodchester Mansion, Stroud, Gloucester, England * Parliament House, Wellington, New Zealand * Bishop Castle, Colorado, USA * Boldt Castle, Thousand Islands, New York USA * National Monument, Edinburgh, Scotland * Ajuda National Palace, Lisbon, Portugal * Cuenca Cathedral, Cuenca, Spain * Winchester Mystery House, San Jose, California, USA * Neuschwanstein Castle, Bavaria, Germany * Torre de la Escollera, Cartagena, Colombia * Plaza Rakyat, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia * Sagrada Família, Barcelona, Spain ==References== Category:Construction",
