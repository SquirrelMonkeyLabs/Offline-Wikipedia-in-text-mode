 "text": "Obsidian is a computer program where users can take notes and organize ideas. Users can write their notes in a kind of text file called Markdown. In one page, they can create links to another page in the software, and see how they are all connected like a map. It is designed for writers, teachers, students and people who work. Obsidian is free for personal use, but users have to pay if they want to use it for business. == History == Obsidian was created by two people, Shida Li and Erica Xu. They had to stay at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. Li and Xu met each other at university and worked together on other projects before starting Obsidian. The first version of Obsidian came out on March 30, 2020. An important version 1.0.0 came out in October 2022. The most recent version 1.8.10 came out in April 2025. ==References== Category:Software",
