 "text": "Spaghetti Westerns were a name given to low-budget Western movies, which were made by Italian movie companies in the late 1960s. They were different from the American western movies, usually filmed in Italian, had limited budgets, filmed on location in Spain and Italy with minimal sets, and many close-ups and artistic shots. Perhaps the most well-known of these movies is \"The Man with No Name\" trilogy: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three of these movies were directed by Sergio Leone, featured music by Ennio Morricone, and starred American actor Clint Eastwood as the main character. == Other websites == *Spaghetti Western Database Category:Western (genre) movies",
