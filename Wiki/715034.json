 "text": "Donald Henry \"Pee Wee\" Gaskins Jr. (March 13, 1933 â€“ September 6, 1991) was an American serial killer. He was executed by electrocution by South Carolina in 1991. Gaskins was born in South Carolina, the last in a string of illegitimate children. Due to his smallness, he was nicknamed \"Pee Wee\". His youth was characterized by considerable neglect. For instance, when he was one year old, he drank a bottle of kerosene. He grew to 5 foot 2 inch and 130 pounds. Gaskins' serial crime began before the concept was even realized, as a juvenile, which included along with a group of other youths: robberies, assaults and a gang rape. In prison, he was regularly raped. He escaped from prison in 1955 by sitting in the back of a garbage truck, and fled to Florida; he was re-arrested, remanded and paroled in August 1961. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gaskins murdered several teenaged girls and young women. He was later found guilty of eight counts of murder and sentenced to death by South Carolina. While on death row, Gaskins murdered a fellow death row inmate, earning him the title \"Meanest Man in America\". Gaskins was put to death in the electric chair by South Carolina on September 6, 1991. ==Related pages== *Albert Fish *Harvey Glatman Category:1933 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Executed American serial killers Category:People executed by electric chair Category:People from South Carolina Category:American cannibals Category:American robbers Category:American rapists Category:American people convicted of attempted murder",
