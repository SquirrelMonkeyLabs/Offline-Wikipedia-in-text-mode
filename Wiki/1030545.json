 "text": "Rao Tula Ram (c. 9 December 1825 â€“ 1863), an Yadav chieftain, was one of the key leaders of the Indian rebellion of 1857, in Haryana, where he is considered a state hero. He is credited with temporarily driving all of the British rule from the region of present south west Haryana, north east Rajasthan and also helping rebel forces fighting in the historic city of Delhi with men, money and material. After the 1857 uprising ended, he left India, met rulers of Iran and Afghanistan and also established contacts with the Tsar of Russia, to seek their help to fight a war to free India from the British. His plans were cut short by his death in Kabul on September 23, 1863, at the age of 38. ==References== Category:1825 births Category:1863 deaths Category:Yadav",
