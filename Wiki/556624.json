 "text": "California's Gold is a public television travel program that explores the natural, cultural, and historical features of the state of California. The series ran for 18 seasons from 1994 to 2012. There were 443 episodes. It was produced and hosted by Huell Howser for its entire run. The minimal production allowed locations and people to remain the focal point of the program. The series stopped after Howser's death in 2013, although reruns have continued to air after his death. The series' theme song varies between several renditions of \"California, Here I Come,\" but was most often played on the series by local musicians Eddie Enderle and Richard Chon. ==References== ==Other websites== * Huell Howser Archives at Chapman University * California's Gold * Video Podcast Feed - California's Gold * * California's Gold episodes available free on iTunes Category:1990s American television series",
