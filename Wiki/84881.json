 "text": "In volcanology, a lava dome or plug dome is a round-shaped mound created by the eruption of viscous lava by a volcano. Lava domes are formed when erupting lava is too thick to flow and makes a steep-sided mound as the lava piles up near the volcanic vent. Lava domes have formed in Mount St. Helens and experts say a lava dome is growing inside the Shinmoedake volcano in Japan. Category:Volcanology",
