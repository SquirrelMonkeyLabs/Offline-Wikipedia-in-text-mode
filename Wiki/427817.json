 "text": "Analytical psychology is the school of psychology that came from the ideas of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. Analytical psychology has two main parts: * The first part is clinical and related to the care of any particular person (child or adult), who suffers from mental health issues such as addictions, anxiety, depression, panic attacks and fears, using talking and sometimes drawing, painting, music or sand-play. * The second part is about research into all kinds of repeating patterns in the human mind and in human behaviour. They include the contents of dreams, personality types like introversion and extraversion, being shy or a show off, feeling abilities and sensations. The research is guided by clinical theories, observations and experiments like active imagination, free-association of ideas and word association tests. It also includes looking into the meaning of fairy tales, myths and legends as well as paranormal events and coincidences. Category:Branches of psychology",
