 "text": "The 2024 Queensland state election was held on 26 October 2024 to elect all 93 members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. It was conducted by the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ). The incumbent Labor government, led by Premier Steven Miles, tried to win a fourth term in government. However, they were defeated by the Liberal National Party (LNP) opposition, led by Opposition Leader David Crisafulli. Labor held onto a lot of seats in Greater Brisbane, but lost lots of votes and seats to the LNP in cities like Townsville in North Queensland. The Greens tried to win a few inner-city seats from Labor after their success in inner-city Brisbane at the 2022 federal election, but they were not able to and actually did worse than they did in 2020. Big issues in the election included crime, cost of living, healthcare and abortion. Abortion became an election issue because Katter's Australian Party (KAP) wanted to make it illegal again. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Elections in Queensland Category:2024 elections in Australia Category:2020s in Queensland",
