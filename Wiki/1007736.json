 "text": "HD 8673 is a binary star system in the constellation of Andromeda. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.34 and absolute magnitude of 3.56. It is 124.5 light years away from us. They are moving away from us with a heliocentric radial velocity (speed) of 19 km/s. A smaller object, possibly a exoplanet or brown dwarf, was found orbiting around them in 2005. The main (primary) star is classified as an F7 V star. It is almost the same to the Sun but a bit bigger, with a mass of 1.36 times the mass of the Sun and 1.52 times the Sun's size. The star is about 1.5 billion years old and is spinning quickly, with a projected radial velocity of 26.9 km/s. It is emitting off 3.4 times more light than the Sun and has an effective temperature of 6,340 K. In 2011, speckle interferometry measurements suggested that there might be another star close to this one. But more observations showed that it was wrong. Later, a smaller star was found orbiting the main (primary) star. This star is about one-third to half the size of the Sun and is far away from the main star, about 35 to 60 times farther than the Earth is from the Sun. == References == Category:Binary stars",
