 "text": "The New Classic is the debut studio album by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. The album was released on 21 April 2014, under Island in the US, Virgin EMI in the UK. The album features the Billboard Hot 100 number single \"Fancy\" which features English singer Charli XCX as well as guest appearances from R&B; singer Rita Ora and rapper T.I.. Azalea also stated that the reason why she named it \"The New Classic\" by saying \"I think people think of classic and they think of a Nas record or a Jay-Z record or The Chronic, what makes something classic is when you hear it and you have that moment that is a time capsule. When I say 'The New Classic,' I just want to make records that give you that moment for fans that they can remember where they were when they heard it.\" ==Critical reception== The New Classic received mixed reviews from music critics. ==Track listing== ==Credits and personnel== Credits for The New Classic adapted from Allmusic. *1st Down – drums, keyboards, producer, programming *Richard Adlam – keyboards, producer, programming, vocals (background) *Kishan Amin – vocals *The Arcade – producer *George Astasio – drums, guitar, keyboards, programming *Nasri Atweh – main personnel *Iggy Azalea – composer, creative director, primary artist, vocals, vocals (background) *Chris Berdine – packaging *Tim Blacksmith – executive producer, production coordination *Elliot Carter – vocal engineer *Charli XCX – composer, featured artist, vocals *Danny D – executive producer, production coordination *Josh Drucker – assistant *Joey Dyer – composer, drums, keyboards, producer, programming *Mikkel Eriksen – vocal engineer *Mikkel Storleer Eriksen – composer *Frank Farian – composer *Feddaweight – vocal engineer *Clifford Harris – composer *Stuart Hawkes – mastering *Kelli-Leigh Henry-Davila – vocals (background) *Tor Erik Hermansen – composer *Sarah Hudson – composer *The Invisible Men – composer, producer *Jaycen Joshua – mixing *Tiffani Juno – vocals (background) *Ryan Kaul – assistant *Nadia Khan – management *Anthony Kilhoffer – mixing *Raja Kumari – composer, vocals (background) *Benjamin Levin – composer *Lovy Longomba – composer *Mavado – composer, featured artist, vocals *Kurtis McKenzie – composer, drums, keyboards, programming *Daler Mehndi – composer *The Messengers – composer, producer *Adam Messinger – main personnel *Jon Mills – composer, drums, guitar, keyboards, programming *Sean Momberger – keyboards *Brooke Nipar – cover photo *Rita Ora – featured artist, vocals *Jason Pebworth – keyboards *Katy Perry – composer *Yolanda Quartey – vocals (background) *Hal Ritson – drums (steel), keyboards, producer, programming *Daniela Rivera – assistant *Trocon Markous Roberts – composer *Rock City – composer *Kyle Ross – assistant *Jon Shave – drums, keyboards, programming *Natalie Sims – composer *Stargate – instrumentation, programming *Sarah Stennett – executive producer, management *T.I. – composer, executive producer, featured artist, vocals *Phil Tan – mixing *Jon Turner – composer *Miles Walker – assistant *Watch the Duck – featured artist, producer, vocals *Eric Weaver – vocal engineer *Andrew Wuepper – mixing *Gabriel Yared – composer *Daniel Zaidenstadt – vocal engineer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2014) Peak position scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" scope=\"row\" ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2014) Position Australian Albums (ARIA) 43 Canadian Albums (Billboard) 35 US Billboard 200 42 US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) 9 US Top Rap Albums (Billboard) 3 ==Certifications== ==Release history== Region Date Format(s) Label Ref.
