 "text": "Badme is a town in the Horn of Africa, in the disputed region between Eritrea and Ethiopia. The area has been at the centre of a territorial conflict between the two countries, particularly during the Eritrean-Ethiopian War from 1998 to 2000. The town itself became a symbol of the conflict and its resolution has been tied to broader efforts for peace and stability in the region. Badme is administered by Eritrea, but its status has been an issue between Eritrea and Ethiopia. After the peace agreement in 2018, there have been efforts to normalise relations, but the situation remains complex. Category:Geography of Eritrea Category:Settlements in Ethiopia",
