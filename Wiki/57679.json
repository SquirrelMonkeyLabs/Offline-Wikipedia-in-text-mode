 "text": "New Super Mario Bros. is a 2006 platformer video game made and sold by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS game console. It is the first Mario platform game in 2D on a handheld console since Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins in 1992. It was first sold in stores in North America on May 15, 2006, and was later sold in stores in Japan on May 25, 2006, in Australia on June 8, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006. It is the first game in the New Super Mario Bros. series. An indirect successor, New Super Mario Bros. Wii for the Wii, was released in November and December 2009. ==Story== Mario and Princess Peach are out for a walk when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach. Mario must go through eight worlds to save her from Bowser, and the new antagonist Bowser Jr. List of Worlds # Grass Land # Desert Land # Beach Land # Forest Land (Secret World) # Snow Land # Mountain Land # Sky Land (Secret World) # Lava Land ==Gameplay== The game uses many old features from the older Mario games. The countdown game clock is back; if Mario does not reach the castle at the end, he will lose a life. Mario also must jump and catch onto a flagpole at the end of the level and go into a castle, just like he did in Super Mario Bros. Before and after a level, Mario is on a world map, which was last used in Super Mario World. Mario also has new powers from the 3D games (Super Mario 64 and Sunshine). He can do a ground-pound and a triple jump in the air. Both of these things first started in the 3D games. ==References== Category:2006 video games Category:Mario platform games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Nintendo DS-only games Category:Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development games Category:Side- scrolling platform games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Video games developed in Japan",
