 "text": "At the Earth's Core is a vintage film about prehistoric life. == Plot == With great attention from the public and press, the scholar Dr. Abner Perry and his assistant David Innes set off in a huge mobile drilling machine to explore the interior of the Earth. After a turbulent journey in the rocket-like iron mole, they deviate from their planned course and land in the kingdom of Pellucidar. After defending themselves against a large and aggressive Psittacosaurus immediately after their arrival, they and other people are captured by primitive and brutal animals known as Sagoths, and encounter large Megacerops that resemble wild boars. They meet a kidnapped princess named Dia, and her companion Ra. However, Dia soon flees because David, ignorant of the customs of the people of Pellucidar, has compromised her with his behavior. In their new camp, they meet members of various warring tribes, all of whom have been enslaved by the Sagoths. These in turn, are themselves under the hypnotic influence of the Mahars, a group of intelligent flying Rhamphorhynchuses. After his escape, David frees a human who had previously saved him from the clutches of a large plant, and befriends him in the process. After witnessing a Mahar sacrificial ceremony, both decide to persuade the warring tribes to rebel against Mahars and Sagoths. After their return, Davis is to be sacrificed to an Inostranceiva, but is able to defeat her. Ra is also able to defend himself succesfully when he is attacked by a female Mahar. This gives the enslaved humans the courage to rebel once again. David and Perry find Dia again and are able to defend her against a flame-breathing Mastodonsaurus. David is also able to defeat the warrior to whom Dia promised. At the end, David and Perry reach the surface of the Earth in the White House park. == Creatures featured == * Psittacosaurus (Giant dinosaur) * Megacerops * Rhamphorhynchus (Mahar) * Mastodonsaurus * Homo habilis (Sagoth) * Inostranceiva (Lato or Gorgonopsid) * Tanystropheus (poster) Category:1976 fantasy movies Category:1976 adventure movies Category:British fantasy movies Category:British adventure movies Category:Movies about dinosaurs Category:Movies set in Wales Category:Movies directed by Kevin Connor",
