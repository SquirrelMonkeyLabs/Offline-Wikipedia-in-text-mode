 "text": "The 2024 Australian Capital Territory general election was held on to elect all 25 members of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly. It was conducted by the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Commission (ACTEC). The incumbent Laborâ€“Greens coalition government, led by Chief Minister Andrew Barr and Shane Rattenbury, won a seventh term in government. They were opposed by the Liberal Party, led by Elizabeth Lee. There was a notable decrease in the number of votes the Greens got, which is why they lost some seats. ==References== Category:2024 elections in Australia Category:Elections in the Australian Capital Territory",
