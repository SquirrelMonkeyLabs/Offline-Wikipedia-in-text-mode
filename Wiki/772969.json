Mondale won the Democratic Party's presidential nomination after convincing Frank Lautenberg to support him. Lautenberg's vote gave Mondale the 1,967 delegate votes needed to become the Democratic Party's nominee. Mondale lost the general election, held on November 6, 1984, to incumbent Republican President Ronald Reagan in a landslide. ==References== Mondale 1984",
