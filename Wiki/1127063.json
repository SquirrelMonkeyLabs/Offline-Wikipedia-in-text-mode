 "text": "David Jacks (18 April 1822 - 11 January 1909) was a landowner, developer, and businessman in the US State of California. Born in Scotland, he emigrated to California, United States during the 1849 Gold Rush, and soon acquired several thousand acres in and around Monterey, shaping the history of Monterey County, California in the first decades of American possession. He is also credited as being the first to market and popularize Monterey Jack cheese. He was born David Jack, but started spelling his last name \"Jacks\" once in California. In 1850, Jacks moved to Monterey, initially taking up a job in the store of a fellow Scotsman, James McKinlay. By 1852 Jack had been elected Treasurer of Monterey County and began purchasing land in the area. ==References== == Other websites == * A Memorial and Biographical History of the Coast Counties of Central California David Jacks, pp 241â€“249 *David Jack, a historical review *Biography of David Jack by Kenneth C.
