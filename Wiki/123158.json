 "text": "Jhangochi, also referred to as Jhangvi, Jhangli, Rachnavi or Jatki, is a Punjabi dialect spoken in the central regions of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is, sometimes, regarded as the oldest and most conservative dialect of the Punjabi language. It is spoken throughout a widespread area, at both ends of the Jhelum, Ravi and Chenab rivers, in parts of Jhang, Khanewal, Vehari, Chiniot, Khushab, Sargodha and Chakwal districts of Punjab. It is also spoken in few areas of Muzaffargarh and Lodhran districts of Pakistani Punjab and Fazilka district of Indian Punjab and Sri Ganganagar of Rajasthan. Jhangochi is transitional with the Majhi dialect, but has several aspects that set it apart from other Punjabi varieties. This area has a great culture and heritage, especially literary heritage, as it is credited with the creation of the famous epic romance stories of Heer Ranjha and Mirza Sahiban. It is spoken in the Bar areas of Punjab, i.e. areas whose names are often suffixed with 'Bar', for example Sandal Bar, Kirana Bar, Neeli Bar and Ganji Bar. ==Notes== Category:Punjabi language",
