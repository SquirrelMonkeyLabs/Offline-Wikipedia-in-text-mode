 "text": "Sodomy laws in the United States were laws that made certain kinds of sexual activity illegal. In the past, there were federal laws against sodomy. Every state also had a sodomy law, even in the 20th century. Starting in the 1960s, some states began to repeal (throw out) their sodomy laws. In 2003, in a case called Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that sodomy laws were unconstitutional. This means no sodomy law in the United States can be used to charge a person with a crime. ==Types of laws== Most sodomy laws in the United States made both oral sex and anal sex illegal. However, state laws did not agree on who could not do these things. Every state law made sodomy between homosexual couples illegal. Other state laws also made sodomy illegal between heterosexual couples, if they were not married. The strictest laws made sodomy illegal in every case, even between married couples. Some sodomy laws also included bestiality in their definition of \"sodomy.\" ==Creation of sodomy laws== The first sodomy laws in America were created when America was still a colony of the British Empire. In the Jamestown colony (the first permanent settlement in America), sodomy could be punished by execution.Crompton, Louis (1976). Homosexuals and the Death Penalty in Colonial America. Journal of Homosexuality 1 (3): 277-293. . Sodomy could be punished by execution in many of the other American colonies as well. In cases of rape or statutory rape, the victim was often punished also. Sometimes the victim was executed along with their rapist. Historians are not sure exactly how many people were executed for sodomy in colonial America: * In the 1600s, when executions for sodomy were most common, there may have been fivePaternoster, Raymond (1991).

Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. . people executed for sodomy (including bestiality) * From 1700 to independence in 1776, there may have been five more executions for sodomy (including bestiality) * Historian Anne- Marie Cusac says that about fifty people were executed in the American colonies for sexual crimes (though these crimes included rape as well as sodomy) By the time the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791, every state in the new United States had laws that treated sodomy as a crime. ==Punishments== Before 1963, every state in the United States had laws against sodomy. The states did change these laws so that sodomy was no longer a capital crime. However, punishments could be as severe as life in prison. Ethics scholar Richard Weinmeyer writes: According to the Mattachine Society, one of the oldest gay rights groups in the United States, these were the punishments for breaking sodomy laws in 1964: State Punishment State Punishment State Punishment Alabama 2–10 years in prison Alaska 1–10 years in prison Arizona 5–20 years Arkansas 1–21 years California At least 1 year Colorado 1–14 years Colorado 1–14 years Connecticut 30 years Delaware 3 years and $1000 fine District of Columbia 10 years or $1000 fine Florida 20 years Georgia 1–10 years for 1st conviction 10–30 years for 2nd conviction Hawaii 20 years and $1000 fine Idaho At least 5 years Illinois Indiana 2–14 years, or $100–1000 fine, or both Iowa 10 years Kansas 10 years Kentucky 2–5 years Louisiana 5 years or $2000 fine, or both Maine 1–10 years Maryland 1–10 years Massachusetts 20 years Michigan 15 years Minnesota 20 years Mississippi 10 years Missouri At least 2 years Montana At least 5 years Nebraska 20 years Nevada 1 year to life in prison New Hampshire 20 years New Jersey 20 years or $5000 fine , or both New Mexico 2–10 years or $5000 fine, or both New York 3 months North Carolina 5–60 years North Dakota 10 years Ohio 1–20 years Oklahoma 10 years Oregon 15 years Pennsylvania 10 years or $5000 fine, or both Rhode Island 7–20 years South Carolina 5 years or at least a $5000 fine, or both South Dakota 10 years Tennessee 5–15 years Texas 2–15 years Utah 3–20 years Vermont 1–5 years Virginia 1–3 years Washington 10 years West Virginia 1–10 years Wisconsin 5 years or $500 fine, or both Wyoming 10 years ==Repeals begin== In the 1960s, attitudes toward sex became much more liberal in the United States. As this happened, some states began to repeal their sodomy laws. Illinois was the first state to do this, in 1963.Weinmeyer, Richard (November 2014). The Decriminalization of Sodomy in the United States. AMA Journal of Ethics 16 (11): 916-922. In the 1960s and 1970s, seventeen other states repealed their sodomy laws. Another seven states changed their laws to say that sodomy between heterosexual couples was not a crime. These seven states kept laws that made sodomy between homosexual couples a misdemeanor. However, some states refused to change their laws. In 1986, the United States Supreme Court ruled that sodomy laws were constitutional, and that states could continue to use them.Bowers v. Hardwick, . ==Lawrence v. Texas== By 2003, 31 of the 50 states had repealed their laws against sodomy. 15 states had laws left that made sodomy a crime. 4 more had laws that made sodomy between same-sex couples a crime. In 2003, the United States Supreme Court made a landmark decision in Lawrence v. Texas. It ruled that Texas's sodomy law was unconstitutional. This ruling meant that no sodomy law in the United States was constitutional or could be used to charge a person with a crime.Lawrence v. Texas, . In other words, it made sexual activity between homosexuals legal in every state in America. At this time, 19 states still had sodomy laws that they had not repealed. ===Some states refuse to repeal=== As of 2023, a total of 12 states had not repealed their sodomy laws, even though they cannot be used anymore because of Lawrence v. Texas. 9 of these state laws make both heterosexual and homosexual sodomy illegal: 3 more of these state laws ban homosexual sodomy specifically: Kansas,Kan. Stat. 21-5504 Kentucky,KY Rev Stat § 510.100 . and Texas.Tx. Code § 21.06. Since the ruling, 9 states and one territory have repealed their sodomy laws: * Arkansas (repealed in 2005) * Missouri (repealed in 2006) * Puerto Rico (repealed in 2006) * Montana (directed only at homosexual sodomy via a common law definition)Montana Code Annotated § 45-5-505 (repealed in 2013) * Virginia (repealed in 2014) * Utah (repealed in 2019) * Alabama (repealed in 2019) * Idaho (repealed in 2022) * Maryland (repealed in 2023) * Minnesota (repealed in 2023) ==Notes== ==References== Category:LGBT rights in the United States Category:United States federal legislation Category:American LGBT rights law",
