Mugunghwa-ho train is more generally used as a low-priced but slow train. It is offered on almost all lines. Nuriro train has similar level of price and speed with Mugunghwa-ho, but it serves less and shorter sections than the Mugunghwa-ho, from Seoul to Singchang. ==Rail Passes== Korail has many kinds of passes. First, there are some passes available in specific area. For example, with O-train pass, people can take O-train off the V-train on Jungang, Chungbuk, Yeongdong, Taebaek, and Gyeongbuk line. Also, with S-train pass, you can take part of Gyeonbu, Honam, Jeolla, donghae Nambu, and Gyeongjeon line. There is also a pass for youth, which is Rail-ro. People who are under 25 can use it in the summer and winter season.(June 1st - August 31th, December 31th - February 28th). Korail offers a rail pass called Korea Rail Pass, or KR Pass for short, to foreign travellers. The pass lets foreign travellers take most of the trains that Korail runs, including KTX. But subways and tourist trains by Korail are not covered. Foreigners living in South Korea for more than six months are not allowed to use the KR Pass. Korail has another pass for these people, the Happy Rail Pass, which is the same as the KR Pass but more expensive. Korail also sells a Korea-Japan Joint Ticket together with JR Group, including both railways in South Korea and Japan, as well as a high-speed ferry trip between Korea and Japan (or a round trip, depending on the pass). However, the pass cannot be used for KTX, and the holders need to buy an extra ticket (with a 30% discount). ==References== ==Other websites== *Korail Homepage Category:1960s establishments in South Korea Category:1963 establishments in Asia Category:Companies of South Korea Category:Rail transport in South Korea Category:Railway companies",
