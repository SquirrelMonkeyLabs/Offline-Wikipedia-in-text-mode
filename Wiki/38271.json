 "text": "A goal kick is given when the attacking team puts the ball over the end line in football. The other team then takes the goal kick from the goal areas (six- yard box) and the game starts again. Players of the other team have to stay outside the penalty box during the kick. If the defending team puts the ball over the end line, the referee gives a corner kick instead. Category:Football (soccer) terminology",
