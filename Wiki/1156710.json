 "text": "Shivaji, on his way to Panhala, stopped at Belavadi, a village about 20 km southeast of Sampgaon. The village had a small mud fort (gadhi) controlled by Mallamma Desai, a widow and local leader. She had attacked Shivaji's army by plundering their transport bullocks. Shivaji besieged the fort, and Mallamma defended it bravely for 27 days, according to historian Chitnis. After the fort was captured, Sabhasad writes that she was punished, while Chitnis claims she was released and given a small estate. ==Notes== == References == Category:17th-century conflicts Category:17th century in India Category:Maratha Empire Category:History of India Category:Karnataka",
