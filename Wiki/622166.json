 "text": "A tetradecagon or 14-gon is a shape with 14 sides and 14 corners. == Regular tetradecagon == A regular tetradecagon has Schl√§fli symbol {14} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated heptagon, t{7}, which alternates two types of edges. === Area === The amount of space a regular tetradecagon takes up is The area of a regular tetradecagon of side length a is given by :\\begin{align}A &= \\frac{14}{4}a^2\\cot\\frac{\\pi}{14}=\\frac{14}{4}a^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{7}+4\\sqrt{7}\\cos\\left({\\frac{2}{3}\\arctan{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{9}}}\\right)}{3}\\right)\\\\\\ &\\simeq 15.3345a^2\\end{align} a is the length of one of its sides. == Dissection== Coxeter states that every parallel-sided 2m-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the regular tetradecagon, m=7, and it can be divided into 21: 3 sets of 7 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 7-cube, with 21 of 672 faces. Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 The list A006245 defines the number of solutions as 24698, including up to 14-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection. Dissection into 21 rhombs ==Numismatic use== The regular tetradecagon is used as the shape of some commemorative gold and silver Malaysian coins, the number of sides representing the 14 states of the Malaysian Federation.The Numismatist, Volume 96, Issues 7-12, Page 1409, American Numismatic Association, 1983. ==References== ==Other websites== * 14",
