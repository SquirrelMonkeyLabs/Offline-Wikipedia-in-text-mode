Cholera and typhus were deadly diseases spread by sewage in cities, which were growing rapidly. The new law made sure that all new houses had running water and drains. Local councils had to have a medical officer and a sanitary inspector, to make sure the laws on food, housing, water and hygiene were carried out. Towns had to have pavements and street lighting. == References == Category:Health in the United Kingdom Category:1875 establishments Category:19th century Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom",
