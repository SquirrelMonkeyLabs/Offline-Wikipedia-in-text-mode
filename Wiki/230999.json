He was the 7th and current President of the Regional Government of Galicia since 2009 until 2022. He was the leader of the Galician People's Party, the main conservative political party which defeated the socialists in the elections of 2009 and again in the elections of 2012. Feijoo is a strong admirer of Manuel Fraga, although he does not govern Galicia in the same manner. Núñez Feijoo studied law in Santiago de Compostela. He is married to the journalist Carmen Gámir. His party had the most votes on the 2023 Spanish general election, but could not find enough allies to form a government. His rival Pedro Sánchez could form a government on November. == References == Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of the Regional Government of Galicia",
