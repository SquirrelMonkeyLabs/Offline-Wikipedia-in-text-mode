 "text": "The Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment (ADUG) is a United Arab Emirates (UAE) private equity company owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He is a member of the Abu Dhabi Royal Family. He is also the Minister of Presidential Affairs for the UAE. It was first thought that Abu Dhabi United Group is a part of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund owned by Abu Dhabi. But Abu Dhabi United Group had denied connection to the government of Abu Dhabi. The Group bought Manchester City Football Club. The deal was announced on 1 September 2008. It was made between the clubâ€™s former owner Thaksin Shinawatra, former Prime Minister of Thailand, and ADUG. The American educated Sulaiman Al-Fahim was the public face of ADUG during the beginning of the takeover. He is often called the \"Donald Trump of Abu Dhabi\". The takeover was completed on 23 September 2008. ==References== Category:Companies of the United Arab Emirates",
