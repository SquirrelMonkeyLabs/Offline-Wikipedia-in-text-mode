 "text": "Rowena Ravenclaw is a character in the books about Harry Potter written by J. K. Rowling. In the books Rowena Ravenclaw was a witch in the 10th century who was one of the four people who started Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a school in a castle in Scotland. She also started Ravenclaw House, which is one of the four groups of students called \"Houses\" at Hogwarts. Each student in the school is in one of the four Houses and each House has its own dormitory, an area of Hogwarts Castle where students in that House live. The Ravenclaw dormitory is in one of the towers of the castle. Her daughter, Helena Ravenclaw was killed by The Bloody Baron in the forests of Albania. She is now a ghost at Hogwarts known as \"The Grey Lady\". In the fourth book about Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the Sorting Hat sings a song about the four people who started the school. In the song it says that Rowena Ravenclaw was from a glen, so this tells us that Rowena Ravenclaw was from Scotland. == References == === Biography === * * Category:Harry Potter characters",
