During his presidency, his administration was criticized because of their handling of the Mexican Dirty War. He was a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. From 1978 to 1979, he was the Mexican Ambassador to Australia and New Zealand. ==Presidency== When he was president, Echeverría banned almost every form of rock music in Mexico because of the rise of youth protestors in the 1970s. In 1971, he created the country's first environmental law.Stephen P. Mumme, C. Richard Bath, and Valerie J. Assetto. \"Political Development and Environmental Policy in Mexico.\" Latin American Research Review, vol. 23, no. 1 (1988), pp. 7-14 He was a critic of dictators such as Augusto Pinochet and gave refugees asylum in Mexico. He also had a close partnership with Chairman Mao Zedong. He was an unsuccessful candidate for United Nations Secretary-General. Echeverría did not have good relations with Israel after supporting a UN resolution that made Zionism the same as racism. When he was president, Echeverría brought economic growth to the Mexican economy, as it grew by 6.1% and fixed the country's infrastructure.El sexenio de Luis Echeverría Clío, 1999 However, many saw that his presidency was authoritarian. Many blamed him for the 1971 Corpus Christi massacre against student protesters, the Dirty War against leftist critics in the country, and the economic crisis that happened in Mexico towards the end of his term. ==Personal life== Echeverría was born in Mexico City, Mexico and studied at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He turned 100 in January 2022. He was married to María Esther Zuno from 1945 until her death in 1999. They had eight children.
