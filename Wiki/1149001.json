 "text": "Exlantix () - Chinese manufacturer of electric and hybrid passenger cars, based in Wuhu, operating since 2024. It belongs to the Chinese concern Chery Automobile. == History == In October 2023, while preparing for the Chinese market debut of the new \"Sterra\" model line under the Exeed brand, the Chery Automobile concern confirmed plans to export cars from this series to foreign markets. With export in mind, the new Exlantix brand was created, which first debuted in September 2024 on the Russian market. The first to go on sale was the hybrid variant of the Sterra ET model under the name Exlantix ET, which did not undergo any visual modifications and was limited to other manufacturer's markings departing from the parent \"Exeed\". In October 2024, the Exlantix portfolio was supplemented by a second model, this time an equivalent of the Chinese Exeed Sterra ES. The car retained its fully electric drive system and also did not change its original appearance, receiving the name Exlantix ES. Starting from 2025, the market reach of Exlantix will be expanded, with the European market being the first to be added to the local offer of the Chery Group, alongside the Omoda and Jaecoo brands. == References == Category:Automobile companies of China",
