 "text": "The Clone Wars was a period in the Star Wars movies. It was first mentioned in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977) and was explored later in several films, books, and television series. Within the Star Wars franchise, the Clone Wars are a galactic war that lasted from 22 BBY to 19 BBY. The war was fought by the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order on one side against the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Sith on the other. Ultimately, both sides lost and the Galactic Empire was born under Sith rule. The war began during the events of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002) and ended in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2008, an animated film called Star Wars: The Clone Wars and a similarly named television series were released. These focused on the events that occurred in between. Other less prominent media have explored this period as well, such as Star Wars: Clone Wars (an animated series from 2003 to 2005) and comic books focusing on Darth Maul. Several new Star Wars characters were created in this period that have become very popular, such as Ahsoka Tano and Asajj Ventress. Category:Star Wars",
