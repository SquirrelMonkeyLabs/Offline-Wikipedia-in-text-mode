 "text": "The Democratic Left Alliance was a social-democratic political party in Poland. It was formed on 9 July 1991 as an electoral alliance of centre-left parties. It became a single party on 15 April 1999. It was the major coalition party in Poland between 1993 and 1997, and between 2001 and 2005, with four Prime ministers coming from the party: Józef Oleksy, Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Leszek Miller and Marek Belka. It then faded into opposition, overshadowed by the rise of Civic Platform and Law and Justice. In February 2020, the party initiated a process to absorb the Spring party, choosing the name New Left (), and changing to a more modern logo. The party was a member of the Party of European Socialists and Progressive Alliance. ==References== Category:Political parties in Poland",
