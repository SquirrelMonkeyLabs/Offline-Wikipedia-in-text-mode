 "text": "The Black Power movement was a social movement supported by African-Americans who wanted safety and support in African American neighborhoods, Black Power activists founded Black-owned bookstores, food cooperatives, farms, media, printing presses, schools, clinics and ambulance services. The international impact of the movement includes the Black Power Revolution in Trinidad and Tobago. By the late 1960s, Black Power became violent to fight against American white supremacy. Most of these ideas were inspired by Malcolm X's criticism of Martin Luther King Jr.'s peaceful protest methods. ==References== Category:American civil rights",
