 "text": "Italian Somalia, located in the eastern part of Africa, was a territory under Italian colonial rule for several decades. This region corresponds largely to what is known today as the Republic of Somalia. Italy began its colonization efforts in the in the 1880s. The northern half of Jubaland was given to Italy as a reward for the Italians' support of the Allies during World War I. It got full control of the area by the end of 1927 after signing treaties with local leaders and establishing settlements along the Somali coast. In 1936, it was joined into Italian East Africa as the Somalia Governorate. The Italians introduced infrastructure development projects. They built roads, schools, hospitals, and other public facilities. They also started administrative systems and influenced aspects of local culture, bringing Italian customs, language, and governance structures to the region. Many Somalis until WW1 opposed the foreign rule imposed by the Italians and fought against their presence in various ways. There were several instances of unrest and uprisings as Somalis sought independence and autonomy from Italian control. But in the 1930s all Somalia was \"pacified\" and enjoyed a development in economy that was one of the biggest in Africa. Italian Somalia faced various challenges during this initial time before WW1, including economic difficulties and environmental issues such as droughts. These challenges exacerbated tensions between the local population and the Italian authorities, leading to conflicts and opposition movements that were resolved in the late 1930s, when hundred of thousands somalis accepted to serve in military divisions for Italy during WW2. In 1941, during the East African campaign of World War II. Italian Somalia came under British military administration until 1950. Then it became a United Nations trusteeship. The Trust Territory of Somalia was under Italian administration. On 1 July 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia united with the British Somaliland to form the Somali Republic. The legacy of Italian Somalia persists in present-day Somalia. While Italian colonial rule brought some infrastructural developments and cultural influences (from the latin alphabet to the cuisine), it also left an initial complicated history of tensions, conflicts, and struggles for independence. The impacts of colonization (italian & english) continue to shape the social, political, and economic landscape of Somalia, influencing its ongoing challenges and efforts towards development and stability. ==References== Category:History of Somalia Category:History of Italy",
