 "text": "Natural gender is a linguistic category for the sex of real life beings, both the biological sex of animals or the social identity of a person. The sex, of humans and animals, is marked in many languages by a corresponding grammatical gender and specific words. The term sex (or sexus) does not apply to words that do not refer to living things. For example: the word \"table\" is grammatically feminine in Spanish, but tables are not \"feminine\". The gender of words in those languages divides words into grammatical classes (into genders), which require a language for all nouns. == References == Category:Linguistics Category:Grammar Category:Gender",
