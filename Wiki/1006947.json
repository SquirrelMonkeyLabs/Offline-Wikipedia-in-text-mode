In 2016, Accellion started to create integrations with major cybersecurity independent software vendors (ISVs). In 2020, Accellion was rebranded as Kiteworks. The Kiteworks Private Content Network is a consolidated platform for file and email data communications, designed to reduce data privacy exposure risk and demonstrate compliance with regulations. In late 2020, a zero-day exploit on a legacy product led to data breaches of dozens of government and private organizations in multiple countries. The company's products are used by over 3,800 organizations worldwide. In January 2022, Kiteworks acquired totemo, an email encryption gateway provider based in Zurich, Switzerland. == References == Category:1999 establishments in the United States Category:American software companies",
