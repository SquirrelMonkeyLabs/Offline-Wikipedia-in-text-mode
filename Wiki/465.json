Sailors from Britain were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with scurvy. This is how they got the nickname Limey. There are several citrus trees whose fruits are called limes. They include the key lime Citrus aurantiifolia, the Persian lime, the kaffir lime, and the desert lime Citrus glauca. Limes are small, round and bright green. If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow. Then they look like small round lemons. Lime juice is used in cooking and in drinks.
