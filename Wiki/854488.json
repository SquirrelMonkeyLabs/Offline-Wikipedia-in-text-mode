 "text": "A set of equations describe the paths in which objects move because of the gravitational force under Earth. Newton's law of universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the body. This is reasonable for objects falling to earth over the short vertical distances of our everyday experience, but is untrue over larger distances, such as spacecraft orbits. Earth gravitational acceleration is 9.8 m/s2 Category:Equations of physics",
