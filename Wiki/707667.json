His equestrian sculpture, Cavalier Arabe is signed both by him and by Alfred Barye. It began at the Salon des Artistes Français in 1870, with two plaster sculptures of Roman gladiators, the bronze casts of which were acquired by the State for the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Guillemin collaborates with major art publishing houses, such as Barbedienne and Christofle. Emile Coriolan Hippolyte Guillemin made his debut in the Paris Salon of 1870 where he exhibited a pair of Roman gladiators, Retaire and Mirmillon, drawn from antiquity. Guillemin specialized in figurative works and was greatly inspired by the Middle East and its exoticism. Representations of Indian falconers, Turkish maidens, and Japanese courtesans firmly established Guillemin's reputation as an Orientalist sculptor from the mid-1870s. Guillemin continued to exhibit at the Salon des Artistes Français until the end of the 1890s, where he showcased a series of busts of Oriental women in bronze. His busts are part of the Orientalist movement and therefore reflect a particular context: Guillemin traveled to North Africa and the Mediterranean Basin to identify the anthropological characteristics of different local cultures. In 2008, the pair of statues he made in 1884, which are known as e Femme kabyle d'Algérie et Janissaire du sultan Mahmoud II was sold at an auction at Sotheby's, in New York, for a sum of 1,202,500 USD, without charges.Sotheby's Auctions House, Sotheby's Auctions Émile Guillemin European art of the 9th century, including Islamic and Orientalist art, Émile-Coriolan- Hippolyte Guillemin (Paris, 1841-1907), Femme Kabyle d'Algerie and Jamissaire du Sultan Mahmoud II the female figure signed and dated Guillemin/1884, the male signed Ele Guillemin, bronze, silver, gold and polychrome patina with colored hard stone cabochons, both raised on an Italian marble pedestal Rosso Levanto of masculine height 36-inch (91.5 cm), sold for , Sotheby's, New York, October 21, 2008. == Museums == ; Canada * Montreal, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts : Eliezer and Rebecca.« Guillemin Émile Coriolan Hippolyte », entry on e-monumen.net. ; United States * Ocala, : Arab Cavalier, circa 1900, bronze, in collaboration with Alfred Barye.« Arab Cavalier », entry on frenchsculpture.org. * Stanford, Iris & B.
