 "text": "A pharmacy is a shop where therapeutic drugs are sold. Sometimes a pharmacy is also called a drug store or chemist and druggist store. The people working in a pharmacy are called pharmacists, druggist or chemists. These people can recognise simple diseases and dispense drugs for some of them. Certain drugs are special, because they can be addictive, or they change the way other drugs act, or they need to be taken in a special way. These drugs cannot simply be bought at a pharmacy. A prescription is necessary to get them. Medical doctors give out prescriptions, which can then be used to get the drug. The rules about what can be bought without prescriptions are different in different countries. There are many small local pharmacy shops. There are also pharmacies in most hospitals which deliver drugs for the patients in the hospital. Many pharmacy shops do not sell drugs only. They also sell beauty products and hygiene-related products, like tampons for women and contraceptives. The number of pharmacies in England has been falling. There were 11,500 active pharmacies in 2022â€” the lowest total since 2015/2016. The number of prescription items given out in 2021/2022 was 1.1 billion, 2.7% more than 2020/2021.
