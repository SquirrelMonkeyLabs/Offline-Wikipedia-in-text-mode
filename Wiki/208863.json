On February 14, 2011, The Rock was announced as the host of WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, appearing live on Raw for the first time in almost seven years. At WresteMania, after the main event between John Cena and The Miz for the WWE Championship ended in a draw, The Rock restarted the match as a no disqualification match. When the bell rang to start the rematch he hit the \"Rock Bottom\" on John Cena to let The Miz pin Cena and keep his championship. After the match The Rock came back in the ring and hit the \"People's Elbow\" on The Miz to end the show. On the following Raw, John Cena called out The Rock and challenged him to a match. The Rock accepted his challenge and said that if they are going to fight, they were going to do it at WrestleMania XXVIII. The Corre came out after The Rock accepted and attacked both The Rock and Cena, Cena and The Rock fought back and beat The Corre. The Rock defeated Cena on April 1 at WrestleMania.
