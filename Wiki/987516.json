 "text": "\"Without You\" is a song by American rapper Quavo. It was released on January 4, 2023, as a standalone single. The song is a tribute to Quavo's nephew and fellow Migos rapper Takeoff who was shot and killed on November 1, 2022. ==Background== On November 1, 2022, Migos rapper Takeoff was shot and killed at the age of 28 during a party with about 40 to 50 people at a bowling alley in downtown Houston where he and fellow Migos member Quavo were at. According to the police, there was a fight over a \"lucrative\" game of dice, but Takeoff was just \"an innocent bystander\" and not involved. After Takeoff's memorial ceremony in Atlanta on November 11, 2022, Quavo wrote a post in which he recalled their shared childhood collecting WWE action figures and Takeoff's love of music. Less than a month before his murder, Takeoff and Quavo released their first collaborative album, Only Built For Infinity Links, which was released in October 2022 under their group name Unc & Phew. On January 4, 2023, Quavo released \"Without You\" as a standalone single with the message \"Long Live Take Infinity\" on social media. It was not made available on streaming services. \"Without You\" was Quavo's first song to be released since Takeoff's death. The song was produced by The Zaytoven, Mike Dean, Elyas, and Eugene. ==Music and lyrics== Musically, \"Without You\" is a gospel track. Jordan Darville for The Fader said the song is a \"raw transmission of the memories, regrets, and hopes that have been swarming through Quavo's mind since Takeoff's passing\". Grant Rindner of GQ described \"Without You\" as a \"slow, pensive\" track that was a \"departure from the usual musical style of Quavo and Migos\". Alex Hudson for Exclaim! said the song is a \"soulful expression of loss\". Aron A. of HotNewHipHop said that Quavo \"delves into his auto-tuned harmonies for a heartbreaking dedication over Murda Beatzâ€™s production\". The song begins begins with an intro from American rapper Vory. Quavo sings using auto-tune over a reflective, minimal beat with melancholy production. He sings about both the good and bad moments he had with Takeoff, including \"smoking big blunts\", performing live at Coachella, and growing up in Atlanta's Northside together. Quavo makes a promise that he will see Takeoff in heaven repeatedly throughout the song while singing over a gloomy guitar accompaniment. He then sings about Only Built For Infinity Links and makes reference to Takeoff's mother's suffering due to her son's death. He mentions that Takeoff's absence is felt most deeply around Christmas and birthdays, saying it greatly affected those who loved him. Quavo later raps about wanting to bring Takeoff back on a time machine, but knows it is not possible. Quavo ends the song by saying Takeoff's name in a long sigh before concluding, \"Take, I'm sorry.\" ==Music video== On the same day as the single, a lyric video for \"Without You\" was made available. The minimalist video was shot in one-take in black-and-white monochromatic and made in greyscale. The lyric video shows Quavo as he sits in a chair in a music studio, smoking a blunt while his eyes are closed and lost in his thoughts. His thoughts are expressed through lyrics that scroll across the bottom of the video. The video ends with the song's lyrics written on a piece of paper with Takeoff's name on the side that is folded origami-style into a rocket ship that blasts out to space, a tribute to Takeoff's rocket mantra. Amber Corrine of Vibe magazine called the video \"simple, yet poignant\" and said it has \"emotional raw footage\". Alli Patton of American Songwriter said the blunt Quavo was smoking was like a \"votive candle to the late rapper\". ==Reception== Patton called the song's beat \"haunting\". Writing for HipHopDX, Andy Bustard called \"Without You\" a \"tender, somber track\". Clash magazine described the song as a \"profoundly moving experience, a naked exploration of sudden loss\". Gil Kaufman of Billboard stated that the track is a \"somber homage and a tear- stained list of cherished memories\". The staff of TMZ claimed the song was \"incredibly moving material\". Jack Irvin of People magazine called the track \"an emotional tribute\", while Regina Cho for Revolt called it a \"heartfelt offering\". Matt Moen for Paper magazine said the song was Quavo's \"more somber offerings\". Sarah Kearn of Hypebeast called it a \"moving new single\". ==References== Category:2023 songs",
