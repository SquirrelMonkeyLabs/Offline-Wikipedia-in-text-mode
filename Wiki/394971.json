It is based upon the Gospel of Luke 2:22â€“39. At the time of Jesus it was expected that the offering of the firstborn and the purification of the mother would take place at the same time 40 days after the birth, as Mary and Joseph did in accordance with what is narrated in the Gospel of Luke.https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202&version;=NLT In connection with this event is celebrated the feast of February 2, which falls 40 days after Christmas. Candles, symbol of Christ \"light to reveal God to the nations\", https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202%3A32&version;=NLTare blessed on this day.
