It is 120 kilometres northeast of Mombasa. Malindi has a tropical savanna climate (As in the Köppen climate classification). The area shows classic examples of Swahili architecture. Malindi developed as part of Swahili Civilization in the 5th–10th centuries.

During World War II Malindi was one of only two towns in East Africa bombed by the Italians. This happened on 24 October 1940. After the World War II Malindi began developing into a resort.
