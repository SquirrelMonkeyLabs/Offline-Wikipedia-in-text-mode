 "text": "Health in the United Kingdom as measured by life expectancy got better from 1841 until 2018. The number of babies dying has gone down because of better food, clean water and drains and more recently because of improvements in midwifery and hospital care. The number of people living with a disability has been going up. It has become more difficult for people to get medical help, especially for poorer and disadvantaged people. In 2023 life expectancy was 81, less than most comparable rich companies. This was blamed on the poor state of the health service, particularly the shortage of clinical staff. Men in Knightsbridge, a very wealthy part of London, lived on average 94.1 years - the highest in the country - nearly 15 years longer than the average man. In South Promenade in Blackpool men lived on average 66.6 years. The Public Health Act 1875 was very important and it was followed by more public health laws. The biggest health problems now are to do with obesity. Smoking in the UK has been reduced from 45% in 1974 to 16.9% in 2015. Mental health is a growing problem and has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Health in Scotland is in many ways worse than the rest of the country. More people die of drugs than in any other country in Europe. 1,330 people died from drug misuse in Scotland in 2021. == References ==",
