In 1974 the two districts were merged, and in 1984 the district changed its name to Siegen-Wittgenstein. == Coat of arms == On the coat of arms, the two upper sections show, to the right, the arms of the Dukes of Nassau, who founded Siegen, and to the left, those of the Counts of Sayn- Wittgenstein. At the bottom a miner's lamp and a coppicing hook are pictured, to remember the mining and charcoal-burning history of the district. ==Towns and municipalities== Towns Municipalities # Bad Berleburg # Bad Laasphe # Freudenberg # Hilchenbach # Kreuztal # Netphen # Siegen # Burbach # Erndtebrück # Neunkirchen (Siegerland) # Wilnsdorf ==References== ==Other websites== * Official webpage * History and genealogy for Wittgenstein",
