 "text": "Electrophorus varii, the Amazon conger, is a species of electric eel found in South America. == Taxonomy == It was previously classified within Electrophorus electricus when that species was considered the only one in the genus Electrophorus, but a 2019 analysis described it and E. voltai as distinct species based on both their deep genetic divergences and differences in the voltage produced by each species. It is also thought to be the most basal member of the three Electrophorus species, diverging during the late Miocene. Category:Gymnotiformes Category:Animals of South America",
