 "text": "Wood flooring is a type of covering made from timber, used for either structural or decorative purposes. Wood is a popular material for flooring due to its variety in styles, colors, cuts, and species. While bamboo flooring is often grouped with wood flooring, it's actually made from bamboo, not timber. Different types of finishes can be used on wood flooring. These include polyurethane, natural substances like shellac and varnishes, and oils. Some floors are also made smooth with brushing and oiling. Older wood floors usually need a process called buffing every few years to keep them smooth. This doesn't apply to floors made in factories. If wood floors get too old or worn, they may need to be refinished. This involves a process called sanding to make them smooth and look new again. In the past, floors were scraped to bring out fresh wood, but this can leave scratches. Now, we have machines to do this job more neatly. == References == Category:Construction Category:Wood",
