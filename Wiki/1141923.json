 "text": "Jeholosaurus is a species of iguanodont that socializes in living on the forests. It lived on the planet during the early Cretaceous period, and was once thought to be a relative of the bird Archaeopteryx in 1992. Now, that's false, and it was finally confirmed to be a plant-eating dinosaur. == Diet habits == Jeholosaurus was once thought to feed on plants, but today, it may be omnivorous. == Relatives == Jeholosaurus had a lot of relatives, such as Dryosaurus and Nanosaurus, well as Fruitadens, Heterodontosaurus, Lesothosaurus, Hypsilophodon and Leallynasaura. == Popular culture == Jeholosaurus is indeed a famous dinosaur, and it has been depicted in a lot of media, such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's film adaption of The Lost World novel, and Planet Dinosaur. However, it was more famously known as Hypsilophodon in some culture. Category:Dinosaurs of Asia Category:Omnivores Category:Iguanodonts",
