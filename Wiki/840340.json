 "text": "Shaggs' Own Thing is a 1982 compilation album with some music by The Shaggs from a recording session in 1975 on it. The music did not come out because Austin Wiggin (the band members' father and manager) died and the band ended after that. The Shaggs' previous album, Philosophy of the World, from 1969, was released again in 1980, and was popular, which is why this album was made. Philosophy of the World only has original songs, which were played badly in a unique way. Shaggs' Own Thing has other original songs, covers of popular songs from the early 1970s and a new version of \"My Pal Foot Foot\", which was from Philosophy of the World, and sounds better because they practiced playing music, had learned the basics of popular music, had better singing voices and could play in pop music styles of the time better. Many people who like the band's music prefer the music of their earlier style, so they ignore this album. The two male singers in Shaggs' Own Thing are Austin Wiggin Jr. and his adolescent son Robert. == Track listing == ;Side one # \"You're Somethin' Special to Me\" # \"Wheels\" (The String-A-Longs cover) # \"Paper Roses\" (Anita Bryant/Marie Osmond cover) # \"Shaggs' Own Thing\" # \"Painful Memories\" # \"Gimme Dat Ding\" (The Pipkins cover) ;Side two # \"My Cutie\" # \"Yesterday Once More\" (The Carpenters cover) # \"My Pal Foot Foot\" # \"I Love\" (Tom T.
