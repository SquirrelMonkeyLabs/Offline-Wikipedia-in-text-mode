She was the first skier to finish the women's visually impaired downhill race, slalom race, giant slalom race and super combined race. Because she cannot see, Natália Šubrtová was her guide and told her where to go when going down the mountain. ==References== Category:Slovak skiers Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Competitors at the 2018 Winter Paralympics",
