 "text": "A brigade is a military unit in an army. Currently, in most armies, a brigade is made up of several thousand soldiers in several battalions plus a brigade headquarters. This is common in the United States Army. Before World War II, a \"square division\" had two brigades and each brigade had two regiments. Some modern armies have several types of brigades. Each of these brigades has a brigade headquarters and a few battalions. Depending on the country an army brigade is under the command of a Brigadier General or a Colonel. Category:Army",
