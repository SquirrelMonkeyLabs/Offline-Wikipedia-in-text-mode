 "text": "The 1911-12 Austrian football championship was the first season of the Austrian Bundesliga. SK Rapid Wien was the first champion. For the 1911/12 season, the NÖFV (Lower Austrian Football Association) announced a championship with compulsory match dates for Viennese clubs for the first time. This championship is officially considered the first Austrian football championship. Because the Austria-Hungary Empire existed then there was a second equal Austrian championship in Moravia-Silesia. In Hungary, a championship was organized by the Hungarian Football Association for the seventh time. From today's perspective if you refere to the Austrian championship of 1912 you mean first class of the NöFV. The last 3 match days were played without the national team players, which took part in the Olympic Games in Stockholm. Austria Soccer ==Founding members== Founding members were the 11 Viennese clubs of the unofficial championship from the previous season. All other clubs from the 1910/11 season were excluded from participation. ASV Hertha Wien was the 12th club as champions of the second class. * SK Rapid Wien * Wiener Sport-Club * Wiener Association FC * Wiener AC * 1.
