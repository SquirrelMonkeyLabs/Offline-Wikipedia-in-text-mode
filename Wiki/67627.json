 "text": "Amiri Baraka (born Everett Leroy Jones; October 7, 1934 – January 9, 2014), previously known as LeRoi Jones, was an American writer. He has written poetry, drama, essays and music criticism. He is also the father of Newark city mayor Ras Baraka. Baraka has been called \"one of the most influential and prolific African American writers of the twentieth century.\" Baraka's poetry and other writing have been both praised and hated. In the African-American community, some compare Baraka to James Baldwin. They see him as one of the most respected and most widely published black writers of his time. Others have said that his work shows much violence, misogyny, and homophobia. ==Racism== Baraka's writings have made controversy over the years, mostly because of his advocacy of rape and violence towards (at many times) women, gay people, white people, and Jews. Critics of his work have said such words are examples of racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism in his work.David L. Smith . Amiri Baraka and the Black Arts of Black Art . boundary 2.
