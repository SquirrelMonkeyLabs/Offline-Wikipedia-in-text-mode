Established in 1967, it is one of the country's leading producers of refined copper products. The company was initially formed to take over the copper mines of the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) and has since evolved into a fully integrated copper-producing company, managing operations from mining to beneficiation, smelting, and refining.https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/expansion-of- assets-like-hindustan-copper-anil-agarwal-calls-for-boost-in-domestic-mineral- production-11727069882697.htmlhttps://www.goodreturns.in/personal- finance/miniratna-psu-hindustan-copper-to-declare-dividend-shares- gain-180-in-2-yrs-1373755.html == History == Hindustan Copper Limited was set up by the Government of India with the objective of making India self- sufficient in copper production. Over the years, the company expanded its operations across different regions of India, developing multiple mines, beneficiation plants, and smelting units. HCL's primary operations are in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra. == Key Operations and Assets == * Malanjkhand Copper Project (MCP): in Madhya Pradesh, MCP is the largest open-pit copper mine in India, contributing significantly to the companyâ€™s copper ore production. * Khetri Copper Complex (KCC): in Rajasthan, KCC includes both underground mines and a concentrator plant, making it one of HCL's oldest and most important operations. * Indian Copper Complex (ICC): in Jharkhand, ICC encompasses underground mines, a beneficiation plant, and a smelter, playing a key role in the refining processes of HCL. * Taloja Copper Project: in Maharashtra, this project is involved in the conversion of blister copper into refined copper. == Strategic Importance == Copper plays a crucial role in sectors such as electricity generation, construction, and transportation. With India's focus on becoming a manufacturing hub under the Make in India initiative, the demand for copper is expected to rise significantly. Hindustan Copper is well-positioned to meet this demand and reduce the country's reliance on copper imports. HCL also plays a strategic role in India's energy transition. Copper is essential in renewable energy infrastructure, including solar and wind power components, where copper is required for wiring and transformers. == References == == Other websites == * Official Website of Hindustan Copper Limited Category:Kolkata Category:Mining companies Category:Companies of India",
