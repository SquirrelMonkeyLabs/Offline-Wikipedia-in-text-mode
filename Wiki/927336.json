This was the 17th direct presidential election and 15th vice presidential election in the Philippines since 1935. President Rodrigo Duterte could not run for re- election because he was limited to a single term, while vice president Leni Robredo could have ran for re-election but chose to run for the presidency instead. This election elected the 17th president and the 15th vice president. The position of president and vice president are elected separately. The 2022 presidential election was the first where all candidates for president were born after World War II ended.
