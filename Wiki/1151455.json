 "text": "Faith healing is a form of magical thinking where the healer says prayers, puts their hands on the sick person in the belief that the healer's actions will cure the person. Scientific explanations for magical thinking include coincidence, the placebo effect, self-deception, staged events, and natural causes. See materialism. In response, some people may stand and physically tremble, while others may literally fall down to the ground in what they call \"falling under the power\" of the Holy Spirit. The medical corroboration of both the injuries sustained by healings and the healings themselves has been a common topic of dissension in the media. ==References== Category:Religious behavior and experience",
