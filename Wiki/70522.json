In the 1960s, professors Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert collaborated on a book titled The Psychedelic Experience, which adapted portions of the Tibetan Book of the Dead as a guide for use in LSD experiences. They hoped to give users of LSD a simulation of death and rebirth, to \"liberate\" them from past problems or mistakes in their lives. Dass died on December 22, 2019 in Maui, Hawaii at the age of 88.Ram Dass, Beloved Spiritual Teacher, Has Died ==References== Category:1931 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Educators from Boston Category:Writers from Boston",
