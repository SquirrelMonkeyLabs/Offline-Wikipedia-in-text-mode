 "text": "Refried beans (from Spanish: frijoles refritos, lit. rehashed or warmed-over beans') is a dish of cooked and mashed beans that is a traditional staple of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, although each cuisine has a different approach when making the dish. Refried beans are also popular in many other Latin American countries. The English \"refried beans\" is a mistranslation, since the essence of \"frijoles refritos\" is the reheating and mashing of the beans. In this dish, after being boiled and then mashed into a paste, the beans are fried or baked, though as they are fried only once, the term \"refried\" is misleading. As described by Rick Bayless, \"they're refritosâ€”not fried again, as you might assume, but 'well fried' or 'intensely fried.'\" Category:American food Category:Mexican food Category:Bean dishes",
