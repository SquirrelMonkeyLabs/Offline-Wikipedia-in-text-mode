 "text": "This article lists the heads of state of Sudan since the country's independence in 1956. ==Background== Since independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956, six individuals (and three multi-member sovereignty councils) have served as head of state of Sudan. Sudan was governed as a condominium by Egypt and the United Kingdom, under the name Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. In November 1958, General Ibrahim Abboud led a military coup d'état, assuming the role of head of state as Chairman of the Supreme Council. Assuming the title of president in 1964, he resigned later that year due to general discontent around the rule of the military regime. Abboud was replaced by a senior civil servant, Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa, who served as acting president for 18 days before transferring executive authority to a Committee of Sovereignty. == List == (Dates in italics indicate de facto continuation of office) Portrait Incumbent Tenure Party Turco-Egyptian Sudan Isma'il Kamil Pasha, Commander 1820 1821 Muhammad Bey Defterdar, Commander 1821 1824 Osman Bey Jarkas, Commander September 1824 May 1825 Mahu Bey Urfali, Commander May 1825 March 1826 Ali Khurshid Agha, Governor March 1826 1835 Ali Khurshid Pasha, Hakimdar 1835 June 1838 Ahmad Pasha abu Widan, Hakimdar June 1838 6 October 1843 Ahmad Pasha Manikli (Manliki), Hakimdar 1843 1845 Khalid Khusraw Pasha, Hakimdar 1845 1850 'Abd al-Latif Pasha, Hakimdar 1850 January 1851 Rustum Pasha Jarkas, Hakimdar January 1851 May 1852 Isma'il Haqqi Pasha abu Jabal, Hakimdar May 1852 1853 Salim Pasha Sa'ib al-Jaza'irli, Hakimdar 1853 1854 Ali Pasha Sirri al-Arna'ut, Hakimdar July 1854 November 1854 Ali Pasha Jarkas, Governor 1854 1855 Arakil Bey al-Armani, Governor 1856 1858 Hasan Bey Salama Jarkas, Governor 1859 1861 Muhammad Rasikh Bey, Governor 1861 1862 Mūsā Pasha Ḥamdī, Hakimdar 1862 1865 'Umar Bey Fakhri, acting Hakimdar 1865 November 1865 Ja'afar Pasha Sadiq, Hakimdar November 1865 1866 Ja'afar Pasha Mazhar, Hakimdar 1866 5 February 1871 Ahmad Mumtaz Pasha, Hakimdar 5 February 1871 October 1872 Edhem Pasha al-Arifi at-Atqalawi, acting Hakimdar October 1872 1872 Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur, Hakimdar 1872 18 May 1877 Charles George Gordon (\"Gordon Pasha\"), Hakimdar May 1877 December 1879 Muhammad Rauf Pasha, Hakimdar December 1879 February 1882 Carl Christian Giegler (\"Giegler Pasha\"), acting Hakimdar 4 March 1882 11 May 1882 'Abd al-Qadir Pasha Hilmi, Hakimdar May 1882 March 1883 'Ala al-Din Pasha Siddiq, Hakimdar March 1883 5 November 1883 Henry Watts Russell de Coetlogon, acting Hakimdar February 1884 18 February 1884 Charles George Gordon (\"Gordon Pasha\"), Hakimdar 18 February 1884 26 January 1885 Territory of Turkish Sudan under complete control of Mahdiyah (Mahdist State) 26 January 1885 2 October 1898 Mahdist State Muhammad Ahmad, Mahdi 29 June 1881 22 June 1885 Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, Khalifa 22 June 1885 2 September 1898 British Military Administration Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, Military Governor 2 September 1898 19 January 1899 Anglo- Egyptian Sudan (condominium) Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener, Governor- General 19 January 1899 22 December 1899 Sir Francis Reginald Wingate, Governor-General 22 December 1899 31 December 1916 Sir Lee Oliver Fitzmaurice Stack, Governor-General 1 January 1917 20 November 1924 , acting Governor- General 21 November 1924 5 January 1925 ===Governor-General=== Portrait Incumbent Tenure Party Sir Geoffrey Francis Archer, Governor-General 5 January 1925 6 July 1926 Sir John Loader Maffey, Governor-General 31 October 1926 10 January 1934 Sir George Stewart Symes, Governor-General 10 January 1934 19 October 1940 Sir Hubert Jervoise Huddleston, Governor-General 19 October 1940 8 April 1947 Sir Robert George Howe, Governor-General 8 April 1947 29 March 1954 Sir Alexander Knox Helm, Governor-General 29 March 1954 12 December 1955 Muhammad Ahmad Abu Rannat, acting Governor-General 12 December 1955 1 January 1956 == List == #
