 "text": "Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson (n√© Strain, January 7, 1890 - September 21, 1965) was an influential figure in the early history of comic books and is often credited with founding one of the first comic book publishing companies in the United States. He is best known for establishing the company National Allied Publications in 1934, which later became part of DC Comics. Wheeler- Nicholson's innovative approach to storytelling and character development helped to shape the comic book medium. He was instrumental in the creation of some of the earliest superhero characters during the Golden Age of Comics. His publication, New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine, is often regarded as the first comic book ever to feature original content, rather than reprints of newspaper comics. Throughout his career, Wheeler-Nicholson faced various challenges, including financial difficulties and creative disputes, but his contributions laid the groundwork for the comic book industry as it is known today. His legacy continues to influence creators and the medium itself.",
