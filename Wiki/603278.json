It is common for people to cook and serve clams on this day. == History == The first deep fried clams were made in Essex, Massachusetts, on July 3rd, 1916. The creator, Lawrence Henry Woodman, owned a small restaurant, where he sold the fried clams to passersby. The food quickly spread around the country and gained attention. Today, National Deep Fried Clams Day is celebrated on November 1st. It is unknown why it is this day rather than July 3rd. == Customs == It is customary to deep fry and serve clams on this day, battering and breading them to form a dish of \"clam strips.\" As well as this, a more modern method of celebrating is to post #DeepFriedClamsDay on social media. == Other holidays celebrated on November 1st == * National Family Literacy Day * National Go Cook for your Pets Day * All Saints Day * National Authors' Day * National Brush Day * Prime Meridian Day * National Vinegar Day * National Eating Healthy Day ==Other websites== * https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-deep-fried-clams-day-november-1/ Category:Holidays of the United States Category:November observances",
