 "text": "Sir Christopher Wren (20 October 1632 â€“ 25 February 1723) was a 17th century English architect, designer, astronomer and geometer. He designed 51 churches in London after the Great Fire of London, including St. Paul's Cathedral.Tinniswood, Adrian 2001. His Invention so furtile: the Life of Christopher Wren. Oxford University Press. Vaughan Hart. 1995. St Paul's Cathedral: Sir Christopher Wren. Phaidon, London. Wren was born on 20 October 1632 in East Knoyle, Wiltshire, England. He was educated at Westminster School and Oxford University. He showed an early talent for mathematics. He invented an instrument for writing in the dark and a pneumatic machine. In 1657, Wren was appointed professor of astronomy at Gresham College in London. Four years later, he was appointed professor of astronomy at Oxford. In 1662, he was one of the founding members of the Royal Society. Wren developed an interest in architecture following his studies of physics and engineering. In 1664 and 1665, Wren designed the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford and a chapel for Pembroke College, Cambridge. Thereafter, architecture became his main focus. In 1665, Wren visited Paris. He studied French and Italian baroque styles. In 1666, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the medieval city. Wren produced ambitious plans for rebuilding the whole area. His plans were rejected, partly because property owners insisted on keeping the sites of their destroyed buildings. Wren did design 51 new city churches, including a new St Paul's Cathedral. In 1669, he was appointed surveyor of the royal works. This gave him control of all government building in the country. He was knighted in 1673. In 1675, Wren was commissioned to design the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. In 1682, he designed a hospital in Chelsea, London for retired soldiers, and in 1696 a hospital for sailors in Greenwich. Other buildings include Trinity College Library in Cambridge (1677 - 1692), and the facade of Hampton Court Palace (1689 - 1694). Wren often worked with the same team of craftsmen, including master plasterer John Groves and wood carver Grinling Gibbons. Wren died on 25 February 1723. He was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. His gravestone features a Latin inscription which translates as: 'If you seek his memorial, look about you.'BBC: Christopher Wren ==Gallery of architectural work== File:Sheldonian Theatre Oxford.jpg|Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford University File:Oxford Matriculation 2003.jpg|Interior, Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford University FIle:Tom Tower, Christ Church, Oxford - geograph.org.uk - 42362.jpg|Tom Tower, Christ Church, Oxford University File:St Pauls Cathedral from West adj.JPG|St. Paul's Cathedral, west front File:Saint Paul's cathedral, London 1.jpg|St. Paul's Cathedral, north side with the Chapter House (also by Wren) File:St. Pauls Cathedral with dome.jpg|St. Paul's Cathedral, south transept & dome File:Saint.pauls.cathedral.verytop.arp.jpg|The Lantern, St. Paul's Cathedral File:Londres 125..jpg|Top of north-west tower, St. Paul's Cathedral File:Londres - Catedral de Saint Paul - Interior.JPG|The nave of St. Paul's Cathedral File:Dome of st pauls.jpg|St. Paul's Cathedral, interior of the dome File:Temple Bar - geograph.org.uk - 49967.jpg|Temple Bar London File:ISH WC Trinity4.jpg|Library, Trinity College, Cambridge University File:WrenLibraryCambridge.jpg|Library, Trinity College, Cambridge University, from the river File:WrenLibraryInterior.jpg|Library interior, Trinity College, Cambridge University File:Marlboroughvitbrit edited.jpg|Marlborough House, Westminster as designed by Wren File:Marlborough House.jpg|Marlborough House, Westminster as altered File:Hampton Court 03.jpg|Hampton Court Palace, south front File:Hampton Court 01.jpg|Hampton Court Palace, east front File:KensingtonPalace.JPG|Kensington Palace, south front File:Royal Hospital Chelsea south front.JPG|Royal Hospital Chelsea, south front File:The Chapel, Royal Hospital, Chelsea.jpg|Royal Hospital Chelsea, The Chapel File:Chelsea Pensioners, London.JPG|Royal Hospital Chelsea, Dining Hall File:Greenwich Hospital from Thames.jpg|Greenwich Hospital, north front File:Painted-hall- rnc-gw.jpg|Greenwich Hospital, Painted Hall File:Greenwich naval college dome1.jpg|Greenwich Hospital, the Dome, Painted Hall File:Church of St Bride.jpg|St. Bride's Fleet Street, spire File:StMaryLeBowChurch.jpg|St. Mary- le-Bow, steeple File:St Mary-Le-Bow Interior.jpg|St. Mary-le-Bow, interior File:St Benet Pauls Wharf.jpg|St Benet's Paul's Wharf File:St Margaret Pattens.jpg|St. Margaret Pattens File:St Lawrence Jewry.JPG|St. Lawrence Jewry File:St Mary Abchurch-Painted Interior of Dome.jpg|St. Mary Abchurch, interior of dome File:St_Mary_Abchurch.jpg|St. Mary Abchurch File:St_Peter_upon_Cornhill_3.JPG|St. Peter Upon Cornhill File:St Stephen's, Walbrook.jpg|St. Stephen's Walbrook, exterior File:Interior St Stephen Walbrook.jpg|St. Stephen's Walbrook, interior File:Christ Church Greyfriars.jpg|Christchurch, Newgate St File:St magnus-the-martyr.jpg|St. Magnus-the-Martyr, steeple File:St Magnus The Martyr Interior1.jpg|St. Magnus- the-Martyr, interior File:St Vedast Church.jpg|St. Vedast Foster Lane File:St James Piccadilly.jpg|St. James Piccadilly File:St James Church Piccadilly Interior.jpg|St. James Piccadilly, interior File:St Clement Danes London April 2006 081.jpg|St. Clement Danes File:St Clement Danes Church Interior.jpg|St. Clement Danes, interior File:Church of St Martin within Ludgate.jpg|St. Martin within Ludgate File:Monument great fire of London 01.jpg|The Monument to the great fire of London File:The_Chapel_Emmanuel_College2.jpg|Emmanuel College, Cambridge University, the Chapel File:Greenwich-Royal Observatory-016.jpg|The Royal Observatory, Greenwich File:Wren's sectional plan of Drury Lane, 1674.jpg|Theatre Royal Drury Lane, demolished File:Wren Library - geograph.org.uk - 127737.jpg|Library, Lincoln Cathedral File:Winslow Hall Giano.gif|Winslow Hall, Buckinghamshire File:The Chapel Pembroke College3.jpg|The chapel, Pembroke College, Cambridge University File:The Chapel Pembroke College2.jpg|The interior looking west, The chapel, Pembroke College, Cambridge University File:Windsorguildhall.jpg|Windsor Guidhall == References == Category:1632 births Category:1723 deaths Category:English architects Category:English astronomers Category:English mathematicians Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People from Wiltshire Category:Presidents of the Royal Society",
