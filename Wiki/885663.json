Falkeisen took the opportunity to travel to Bursa in 1843, visiting Athens and Constantinople, to work in his family’s silk factory which was being run by his brother, who was also the Austrian Consul for Bursa. The Falkeisen family bought the factory, together with Tasciyan, an Armenian dragoman from the British Embassy, from a French entrepreneur called M. Glaizal, who had started the enterprise in 1837. The Falkeisen factory was the first steam-powered silk-spinning factory in Bursa and manufactured silk thread. Johann Falkeisen lived in Turkey until 1855 when the family factory was destroyed by fire as a result of an earthquake and he returned to Basel. He then joined the fledgling Kunstmuseum in Basel where he worked as a curator. == Bibliography == * XXV vedute dei luoghi i più interessanti del lago di Como disegnate dal vero ed incise di Johann Jakob Falkeisen, Ed.
