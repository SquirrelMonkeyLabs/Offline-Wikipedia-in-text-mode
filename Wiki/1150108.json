 "text": "The Hyundai Ioniq is a small car made by Hyundai. It was first made in 2016. The Ioniq comes in three types: hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and all-electric. It is known for being the first Hyundai car to not use a normal engine, but instead, it has electric or combined power. == Versions == ===Ioniq Hybrid=== The Ioniq Hybrid uses a 1.6-liter engine and an electric motor. It combines both to produce 139 horsepower. It is known for being very fuel-efficient, with some versions achieving 58 miles per gallon. ===Ioniq Electric=== The Ioniq Electric is the fully electric version. It uses an electric motor powered by a battery. The Ioniq Electric can drive up to 170 miles (274 km) on a full charge, depending on the model year. ===Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid=== The Ioniq Plug-in Hybrid is similar to the Ioniq Hybrid, but it can also drive short distances using only electricity. The car has an electric-only range of about 29 miles (47 km). == Markets == The Hyundai Ioniq was sold in many countries, including the United States, Europe, and South Korea. == Discontinuation == The production of the Hyundai Ioniq ended in July 2022. This was because Hyundai decided to focus on new electric cars under the Ioniq brand. These new models include the Ioniq 5 (a crossover), Ioniq 6 (a sedan), and Ioniq 7 (an SUV), which started to be sold after the Ioniq was discontinued. == References == Category:2010s automobiles Category:2020s automobiles Category:Electric vehicles Ioniq",
