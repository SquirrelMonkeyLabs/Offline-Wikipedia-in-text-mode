 "text": "The Japanese persimmon or Kaki persimmon (Diospyros kaki) (Japanese:カキノキ) (Kanji:柿) this is the well known Sharon fruit, juicy and sweet when ripe and an excellent food source for birds during winter as the tree holds the fruits on the branches for a long time. An elegant, ornamental tree with beautiful, leathery foliage that turns a vibrant orange during autumn. Its fragrant, tiny bell-shaped, yellow flowers appear among the large, leathery leaves in May. It starts to produce fruit from around the age of 6, it is a highly popular non- astringent variety and dioecious tree with a spreading crown clothed in glossy, dark green, oval leaves. They turn yellow, orange or reddish-purple in the fall, creating a glorious display. Pale yellow, bell-shaped flowers appear after the leaves emerge in the spring and mostly go unnoticed. They are followed by a profusion of edible, large, flat, deep orange persimmon fruits, the size of a medium-sized tomato. Fuyu sets fruit without the need for pollination. The tree is a sight to behold when the leaves have fallen, displaying the bright fruits throughout the canopy. They attract wildlife and may persist on the tree for weeks, resembling Christmas ornaments. The fruit is seedless, mild flavoured, sweet and can be eaten in its firm state like an apple or allowed to ripen to soft, mushy texture. Valued for its fruit and attraction to wildlife, Japanese Persimmon is an excellent fruit tree for ornamental use and makes an excellent specimen.
