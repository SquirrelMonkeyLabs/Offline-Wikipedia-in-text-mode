 "text": "19000 Spirit of London is an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 double-decker bus which was first used in London in October 2005. Originally using fleet number 18500, Spirit of London was built as the replacement for the bus destroyed in Tavistock Square during the 7 July 2005 London bombings, killing 13 passengers. Spirit of London was also the first production Enviro400 built by Alexander Dennis. Throughout its time in service, Spirit of London has served as a tribute to the victims of the 7/7 attacks. == Background == On 7 July 2005, there were 4 bombings across public transport in London. One of them was in Tavistock Square on a bus, the two-year-old TransBus ALX400-bodied TransBus Trident double-decker bus, registration LX03 BUF and fleet number 17758, operated by Stagecoach London. It would be scrapped after the attacks. ==Introduction and early years== Spirit of London was first shown to the public on 3 October 2005. It was the first production Enviro400 to be built; the Enviro400 was Alexander Dennis' successor to the Dennis Trident and Alexander ALX400. It was originally assigned Stagecoach fleet number 18500, which is otherwise used for Trident-based vehicles. After a long promotional tour, Spirit of London went into use on route 30 in January 2006, five months after the Tavistock Square attack had occurred on the same route. == Fire == In the early hours of 19 October 2012, the bus would be set on fire by two teenage girls. The fire would cause damage over Â£60,000. Due to the special status of it as a reminder of the 7/7 attacks, Stagecoach London decided to repair it. == Return to service == Spirit of London returned to service in April 2013 after the fire, It was used on route 55. The bus was withdrawn in October 2020 for preservation at the London Transport Museum. In 2020, A Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMC was delivered to Stagecoach London with the fleet number 11377. It was given Spirit of London branding to replace 19000. == References == Category:July 2005 London bombings Spirit of London",
