He was known for being denounced and executed by John Calvin, the founder of Calvinism. == Life == Michael Servetus was born 1511 in Spain. As a young adult, he moved to France to live and study medicine there. In his later life, Servetus became a physician and a theologian there. == Arrest and execution == After being deemed a heretic on 16 February 1553, by Gulliame de Trie, an rich merchant and refugee, Servetus was arrested in Vienne, France, one month later. He was charged on one count of heresy. Servetus escaped prison three days later and went into hiding, only to be captured and arrested again, four months later. Two months later on 24 October, he was sentenced to death by combustion. Servetus wanted to be hanged alive, instead, as this death would have been less painful, but his plea was refused. Three days later on 27 October, Servetus was combusted alive in Geneva. Most historians often record his last words as: \"Jesus, son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me.\" Category:1510s births Category:1553 deaths Category:Spanish physicians Category:Christian theologians Category:People executed by burning",
