They were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in December 1997. The first written text in spanish and euskera was found there in the book called “glosas Emilianenses”.This treasure is the reason why this place is part of the human patrimony. The monasteries were one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007. ==References== ==Other websites== * http://www.monasteriodeyuso.org Category:La Rioja Category:Monasteries Category:World Heritage Sites in Spain Category:6th- century buildings and structures Category:11th-century buildings and structures",
