 "text": "There are many possible dwarf planets in the Solar System. Scientists do not know how many there are exactly. They say there may be up to 200 in the Kuiper Belt. They also say there may be over 10,000 beyond this. The IAU has accepted six of them: Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Quaoar, as well as Ceres in the Inner Solar System. This article numbers those and other possible ones. Only Pluto and Ceres have been confirmed to be in equilibrium. Eris is more a dwarf planet because of being similar to Pluto and more massive. Haumea and Makemake were accepted as dwarf planets for the naming rules, because they were not accepted dwarf planets. The consensus among astronomers include at least Gonggong, Sedna and Orcus. The IAU has accepted Quaoar in a 2022-2023 annual report. ==List of possible dwarf planets== Designation Measured mean diameter Density Albedo Identified as a dwarf planet Category by Emery et al. by Grundy et al. by Brown by Tancredi et al. by the IAU N I Triton 0.60 to 0.95 (likely in equilibrium) (moon of Neptune) 0.49 to 0.66 2:3 resonant 0.96 SDO 0.51 resonant cubewano 0.81 hot cubewano 0.14 N/A 3:10 resonant P I Charon 0.2 to 0.5 (possibly in equilibrium) (moon of Pluto) â‰ˆ 1.7 0.11 hot cubewano 0.09 (close to equilibrium) asteroid 0.23 plutino (2:3 resonant) ? 0.41 detached 0.04 hot cubewano ? 0.10 ?
