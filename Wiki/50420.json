 "text": "Booing means shouting \"BOO!\" several times. When people do this, it means that they do not like it. It is the opposite of applause (clapping to show that the performance was good). If people shout \"boo\" after a performance (for example, a concert, play or opera) they are showing that they did not like it. Booing and hissing used to be very common, especially at the opera. In the early days of opera (from the 17th to the early 19th century) opera audiences often behaved badly. They went to the opera to chat with their friends, but booing has recently become less common in Western culture except at sports events because people think it is rude. ==Related pages== *Applause *Claque Category:Non-verbal communication Category:Criticisms",
