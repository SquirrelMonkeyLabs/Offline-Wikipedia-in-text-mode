BC) was the king of Lydia from 560 BC until his defeat by the Persians.The English name Croesus comes from the Latin transliteration of the Greek , in Arabic và Persian قارون, Qârun. Through his conquest of neighboring lands, he became famous for his wealth. The historian Herodotus and the geographer Pausanias made explicit records of his offerings at Delphi temple. When the Persian Empire grew stronger, King Croesus misunderstood the prophecy at the Delphi temple and subjectively sent troops to attack the Persian king Cyrus the Great. He was defeated and his empire was thrown. According to Herodotus, he was then pardoned and even became a close advisor to Cyrus the Great when the king led his army to fight the Massagetae.
