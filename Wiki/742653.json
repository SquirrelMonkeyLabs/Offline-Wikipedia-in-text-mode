 "text": "Abdalla Hamdok (also transliterated: Abdallah, ; born 1 January 1956) is a Sudanese politician. He was the 15th Prime Minister of Sudan. He first took office on 21 August 2019. On October 25, 2021, he was arrested by armed men during a coup and taken to an unknown location. The European Union, the United States and other countries have said that they continued to recognise the Hamdok cabinet as \"the constitutional leaders\" of Sudan. A month later on 21 November, a deal was made in which all political prisoners including Hamdok were released with Hamdok becoming prime minister again. However, he resigned on 2 January 2022 as protests against the military coup in the country got more intense. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Prime Ministers of Sudan",
