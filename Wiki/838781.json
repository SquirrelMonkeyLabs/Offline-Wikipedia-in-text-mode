Most garbage bags today are made out of plastic. They are usually black, white, or green in color. Plastic bags are an easy and clean way of handling garbage. Plastic garbage bags are fairly light. They are useful for messy or wet rubbish. They are also used for wrapping up garbage to reduce its smell. Plastic bags are often used for lining waste bins. It was in invented in 1950 by Canadians Harry Wasylyk, Larry Hansen and Frank Plomp. In a special on CBC Television, the green garbage bags (first garbage bags in Canada) ranked 36th among the top 50 Canadian inventions. The black plastic bags (the first garbage bags in the United States), are also introduced in 1950. Plastic bags can be burned with the garbage inside them in the right facilities for waste-to-energy conversion. Some can decompose under specific conditions. ==Colors== Trash bags or Trash liners usually come in different colors. However, these colors are not just made to make the trashes look good for the eyes. The colors usually show what kind of trash is supposed to go in them.
