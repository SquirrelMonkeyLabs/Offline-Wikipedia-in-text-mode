He was later the father in law of Philippe Égalité. Though his father was an illegitimate son of a king the young duke was still known as and given the rank of a Prince of the blood. A majority of his vast fortune had been inherited via La Grande Mademoiselle. Hen was also famous for his incredible generosity to the poor of the time. He also owned the land where the future Royal Chapel of Dreux would be built. ==Marriage and children== In 1744 Penthièvre married Princess Maria Teresa Felicitas d'Este of Modena,Virginia G.
