 "text": "A mid-range speaker is a type of loudspeaker. These are designed to reproduce sounds which are not very low, but mid-range speaker can also play hi frequency sounds, example frequency going up to 20kHz. Depending on the speakers structure there can be a tweeter that plays hi-frequencies. Typically it is then a 3-way speaker. If there is only a woofer and mid-range speaker, it would be 2-way speaker.
