 "text": "Brian Shaffer (born February 25, 1979) was a medical student at Ohio State University. On the night of March 31, 2006, Shaffer went out with friends to celebrate the beginning of spring break. He was separated from them and they thought he had gone home. Shaffer has not been seen or heard from since. The case has received national media attention. Columbus police have several theories about what happened; some interest and suspicion has been directed at a friend of Shaffer's who went with him that night but who has refused to take lie detector tests about the incident. While foul play has been suspected, including the possible involvement of the Smiley Face serial killer, it has also been speculated that he might be alive and living somewhere else under a new identity. ==References== S Category:March 2006 events Category:2000s in Ohio Category:2006 in the United States Category:Columbus, Ohio",
