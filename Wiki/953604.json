 "text": "The Maracas heart-tongued frog (Phyllodytes tuberculosus) is a frog. It lives in the Brazil. People have seen this frog between 900 and 1350 meters above sea level. This frog lives in grassland and forests where there is not too much rain. It sits in bromeliad plants that grow on the rocks on the ground. Its tadpoles swim in water that collects in the bromeliad plants. Scientists are not sure exactly how much danger this frog is in of dying out. This frog lives in a large area, but it is divided up into smaller areas and because the places the frog lives are still being changed by humans. Humans change the frog's grasslands and forests into farms, tree farms, and places for animals to eat grass. This means that there is more fire and it is more likely that the bromeliad plants will die. This frog looks like Phyllodytes luteolus, and people sometimes think one frog is the other. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
