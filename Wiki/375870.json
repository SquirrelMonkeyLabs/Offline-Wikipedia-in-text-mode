 "text": "USS Constitution is a wooden, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. Named by President George Washington after the Constitution of the United States of America, she is the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat. == Construction == Constitution was one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed. She was built in 1794 and launched in 1797. Joshua Humphreys designed the six frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships. For this reason, Constitution and the other ships were larger, more heavily armed, and more solidly built than standard frigates of the period. She was built in Boston, Massachusetts at Edmund Hartt's shipyard. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi-War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War. == War of 1812 == See the main article: War of 1812 Constitution is most famous for her actions during the War of 1812 against Great Britain. She captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships: HMS Guerriere, Java, Pictou, Cyane and Levant. === Battle with HMS Guerriere === On August 19, 1812, the Constitution and HMS Guerriere fought a battle about 400 miles (650 km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Isaac Hull captained the American ship; Guerriere's captain was James Richard Dacres. At around 2:00pm the Constitution found, attacked, and damaged the Guerriere. One American officer was killed and another wounded by musket fire. Captain Dacres was also wounded. A shot to the cabin set fire to the USS Constitution. The HMS Guerriere was also severely burned and damaged. While Dacres was preparing to set sail and continue the battle against the Americans, it became obvious that the ship was about to sink. Dacres was asked if he was ready for surrender. He said he didn't know but that they could no longer fight. Later, he surrendered and the HMS Guerriere sank. The battle with Guerriere earned the Constitution the nickname of \"Old Ironsides\". She also earned public adoration that has repeatedly saved her from scrapping. She continued to serve the nation as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons, and circled the world in the 1840s. == American Civil War == See the main article: American Civil War During the American Civil War, Constitution served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy. She also carried artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of 1878. == Retirement == Retired from active service in 1881, Constitution served as a receiving ship until she was designated a museum ship in 1907. In 1934 she completed a three-year, 90-port tour of the nation. Constitution sailed under her own power for her 200th birthday in 1997 and again in August 2012, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of her victory over Guerriere. == Related pages == * Frigate * Naval warfare * War of 1812 * United States Navy ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website * 3D Virtual Tour * The Captain's Clerk â€”Extensive sources including ship logs, personnel rosters and research information Category:Naval transport Category:1794 Category:1797 in the United States Constitution",
