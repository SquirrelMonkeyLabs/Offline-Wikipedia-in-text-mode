 "text": "The Srbosjek () is a wheat sheaf knife that was originally manufactured in Germany for agricultural purposes. ==History== The knife gained notoriety in the former Yugoslavian countries because it was used by the Croatian Ustashas during World War II for the killing of prisoners in the concentration camps of the Nazi-ultranationalist Independent State of Croatia, most notably the Jasenovac concentration camp. ==Description== The upper part of the knife was made of leather, as a sort of a glove, designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole, so that only the blade protruded from the hand. It was a curved, 12 cm long knife with the edge on its concave side. The knife was fastened to a bowed oval copper plate, while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle.Taborišče smrti--Jasenovac by Nikola Nikolić (author), Jože Zupančić (translator),Založba \"Borec\", Ljubljana 1969 The knife described on page 72: 'Na koncu noža, tik bakrene ploščice, je bilo z vdolbnimi črkami napisano \"Grafrath gebr. Solingen\", na usnju pa reliefno vtisnjena nemška tvrtka \"Gräviso\" ' Picture of the knife with description on page 73: 'Posebej izdelan nož, ki so ga ustaši uporabljali pri množičnih klanjih. Pravili so mu \"kotač\" - kolo - in ga je izdelovala nemška tvrtka \"Gräviso\" ' The knife was fixed on the glove plate in order to prevent injuries and to prevent taking care of a separate knife in order to improve the work speed.Margaret E.
