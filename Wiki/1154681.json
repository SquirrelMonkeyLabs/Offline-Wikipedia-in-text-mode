 "text": "Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish. It was originally released from Darkroom and Interscope Records on July 30, 2021. Eilish co-wrote the album with her brother and frequent collaborator Finneas O'Connell. O'Connell also produced the album and played every instrument that was played in the album. Eilish cited the album during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the record. The album is primarily a downtempo pop record. It has sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to mediative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019). The album has seven singles released in promotion of the album: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\", \"Lost Cause\", \"NDA\", the title track, and \"Male Fantasy\". The first three peaked within the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 == Tracks == * My Future * Therefore I Am * Your Power * Lost Cause * NDA * the title track * Male Fantasy == Other websites == *https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/billie-eilish-happier-than-ever/ *https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/arts/music/billie-eilish-happier-than- ever-review.html *https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album- reviews/billie-eilish-happier-than-ever-1206060/ Category:2021 albums Category:Billie Eilish",
