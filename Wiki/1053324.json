 "text": "Succession to the Brazilian throne is determined by descent, sex, legitimacy and religion. The Brazilian monarchy came to an end on November 15, 1889, following a military coup which overthrew Emperor Pedro II and established a republic. According to the Imperial Constitution (1824), the Brazilian monarchy was hereditary according to male-preference primogeniture among the dynastic descendants of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, and the crown could only be inherited by one who held Brazilian nationality.Les manuscrits du C.E.D.R.E. – Dictionnaire Historique et Généalogique, vol. III. Le Royaume de Portugal, L'Empire du Brésil. Cercle d'Études des Dynasties Royales Européennes (president, Jean-Fred Tourtchine), Paris, 1987, pp. 31–33, 42, 51, 66–71, 77–81, 87–90. (French). . The Imperial constitution also states that the monarch and the first in line should be Catholic,Constituição Politica do Imperio do Brazil, art. 103.Constituição Politica do Imperio do Brazil, art. 106. and the marriage of a female heir presumptive required consent of the emperor or the Assembly.Constituição Politica do Imperio do Brazil, art. 120. Prince Bertrand of Brazil is the de jure Emperor of Brazil, and his heir presumptive is his brother, Antônio, Prince Imperial of Brazil. Antônio's two youngest children are next in order of birth: Rafael, Prince of Grão-Pará, Princess Maria Gabriela of Orléans-Braganza. Fourth in line is Princess Eleonora of Brazil, Princess of Ligne, the Emperor's sister de jure; the fifth is Eleonora's youngest son, Henri Antoine, Hereditary Prince of Ligne. ==List== ===Monarchs in Brazil (1500-1815) === :House of Aviz *D.
