 "text": "Bioplastics are plastic materials that are made from biomass sources. These include vegetable fats and oils, corn starch, straw and food waste. Some bioplastics are made directly from natural biopolymers such as polysaccharides (e.g., starch and cellulose) and proteins (e.g. gluten, and gelatin). Others are chemically synthesised from sugar derivatives and lipids. In contrast, common plastics, also called petro-based polymers, are made from petroleum or natural gas. One good thing about bioplastics is is that they are not made from fossil fuel. This is good because there is only a limited amount of fossil fuels. They also can not be found everywhere. This leads to petroleum politics and affects the environment. Studies show that some bioplastics can be made with a lower carbon footprint. Other bioplastics' processes are less efficient and cause a higher carbon footprint than fossil plastics. ==References== Category:Polymer chemistry",
