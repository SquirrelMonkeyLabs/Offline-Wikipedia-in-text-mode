 "text": "The 1930–31 NHL season was the fourteenth season of the National Hockey League. Ten teams played 44 games each. The Montreal Canadiens beat the Chicago Black Hawks three games to two in a best-of-five Stanley Cup final for their second Cup win in a row. Art Ross bitterly complained about the Stanley Cup final setup. His team had been beaten in two games in a row by the Montreal Canadiens in 1929–30. As a result, the Board of Governors decided to make the final a best of five series. ==Regular season== ===Final standings=== GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, PIM = Penalties In Minutes Teams that qualified for the playoffs are highlighted in bold Canadian Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Montreal Canadiens 44 26 10 8 60 129 89 602 Toronto Maple Leafs 44 22 13 9 53 118 99 540 Montreal Maroons 44 20 18 6 46 105 106 568 New York Americans 44 18 16 10 46 76 74 495 Ottawa Senators 44 10 30 4 24 91 142 486 American Division GP W L T Pts GF GA PIM Boston Bruins 44 28 10 6 62 143 90 403 Chicago Black Hawks 44 24 17 3 51 108 78 416 New York Rangers 44 19 16 9 47 106 87 514 Detroit Falcons 44 16 21 7 39 102 105 429 Philadelphia Quakers 44 4 36 4 12 76 184 477 ===Scoring leaders=== GP = Games Played, G = Goals, A = Assists, Pts = Points, PIM = Penalties In Minutes Player Team GP G A Pts PIM Howie Morenz Montreal Canadiens 39 28 23 51 49 Ebbie Goodfellow Detroit Red Wings 44 25 23 48 32 Charlie Conacher Toronto Maple Leafs 37 31 12 43 78 Bill Cook New York Rangers 43 30 12 42 39 Ace Bailey Toronto Maple Leafs 40 23 19 42 46 Joe Primeau Toronto Maple Leafs 38 9 32 41 18 Nels Stewart Montreal Maroons 42 25 14 39 75 Frank Boucher New York Rangers 44 12 27 39 20 Cooney Weiland Boston Bruins 44 25 13 38 14 Bun Cook New York Rangers 44 18 17 35 72 Aurel Joliat Montreal Canadiens 43 13 22 35 73 ==Stanley Cup playoffs== On 26 March, during the second game of the best-of- five series between the Bruins and Canadiens, Art Ross of Boston pulled his goaltender for an extra player while down 1–0 with 40 seconds left in the final period. This marked the first time in NHL history that a goalie was pulled for an extra attacker. In the finals, the Chicago Black Hawks took an early two games to one lead in the newly expanded best-of-five Stanley Cup finals but the Montreal Canadiens came back and won the series three games to two for their second consecutive Stanley Cup win. ===Playoff bracket=== ===Finals=== Montreal Canadiens vs. Chicago Blackhawks Date Away Score Home Score Notes April 3 Montreal Canadiens 2 Chicago Blackhawks 1 April 5 Montreal Canadiens 1 Chicago Blackhawks 2 2OT April 9 Chicago Blackhawks 3 Montreal Canadiens 2 3OT April 11 Chicago Blackhawks 1 Montreal Canadiens 2 April 14 Chicago Blackhawks 1 Montreal Canadiens 2 Montreal wins best-of-five series 3–2. ==NHL awards== 1930–31 NHL awards O'Brien Trophy: Montreal Canadiens Prince of Wales Trophy: Boston Bruins Hart Memorial Trophy: Howie Morenz, Montreal Canadiens Lady Byng Trophy: Frank Boucher, New York Rangers Vezina Trophy: Roy Worters, New York Americans ===All-Star teams=== First Team Position Second Team Charlie Gardiner, Chicago Black Hawks G Tiny Thompson, Boston Bruins Eddie Shore, Boston Bruins D Sylvio Mantha, Montreal Canadiens King Clancy, Toronto Maple Leafs D Ching Johnson, New York Rangers Howie Morenz, Montreal Canadiens C Frank Boucher, New York Rangers Bill Cook, New York Rangers RW Dit Clapper, Boston Bruins Aurel Joliat, Montreal Canadiens LW Bun Cook, New York Rangers Lester Patrick, New York Rangers Coach Dick Irvin, Chicago Black Hawks ==First games== The following is a list of players of note who played their first NHL game in 1930–31 (listed with their first team, stars(*) mark start in playoffs): *Art Chapman, Boston Bruins *Doc Romnes, Chicago Black Hawks *John Sorrell, Detroit Falcons *Johnny Gagnon, Montreal Canadiens *Paul Haynes, Montreal Maroons *Dave Kerr, Montreal Maroons *Alex Levinsky, Toronto Maple Leafs *Bob Gracie, Toronto Maple Leafs ==Last games== The following is a list of players of note that played their last game in the NHL in 1930–31 (listed with their last team): *Frank Fredrickson, Detroit Falcons *Bert McCaffrey, Montreal Canadiens *Joe Simpson, New York Americans *Babe Dye, Toronto Maple Leafs ==References== *Hockey Database *NHL.com Category:1931 in North America Category:1930 Category:National Hockey League seasons Category:1931 in sports Category:1930 in sports",
