It is the national language of the Philippines, and one of the two official languages of the Philippines, with the English language on that last part.J.U. Wolff, \"Tagalog\", in the Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2006 About one third of the people in the Philippines speak Tagalog as a first language, and more people speak it as a second language, especially the Filipino language, or as the Filipino language or in the form of the Filipino language. Filipino is \"in practice\" but not \"according to the law\" used as the formal, official and/or academic name of the Tagalog language, or sometimes it even means the same thing, but this is not \"according to the law\", which as a result or effect of that last part makes Tagalog and Filipino different languages. It is \"in practice\" but not \"according to the law\" usually or commonly called Tagalog, the Tagalog language or as the Tagalog language in the Philippines and among most but not all Filipinos, just to show that it is different from the other languages of the Philippines. The Filipino language is a language that continues to undergo evolution and development from the Pilipino language since 1987, and it has more language influences from the other languages of the Philippines and from foreign languages compared to the core Tagalog language. The Pilipino language, since 1959, is the last or final official name of the former or previous official and national language of the Philippines based on the Tagalog language, all before Filipino was later named and declared to be the new and future national language of the Philippines, and also all before Filipino was later named and declared as the national language and one of the two official languages of the Philippines, with the English language on that last part. ==References== Category:Languages of the Philippines",
