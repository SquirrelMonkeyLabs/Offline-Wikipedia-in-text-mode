 "text": "Akhzivland is a micronation between Nahariya and the Lebanese border on the Israeli west coast. The state was founded by Eli Avivi in 1972. The micronation is promoted by the Israel Ministry of Tourism even though its legal status remains debated. The micronation is located near the ruins of Achziv, an ancient settlement on the Mediterranean coast in the Western Galilee, about 5 kilometers north of Nahariya. A national park, field school, and the ruins of the Palestinian village of Az-Zeeb, which was captured by the Carmeli Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, are located nearby. Eli Avivi died of pneumonia on May 15, 2018. ==References== Category:Micronations Category:Israel Category:1971 establishments in Asia",
