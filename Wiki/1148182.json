 "text": "Conquests of Kanishka are the conquest carried out by Kanishka of Kushan Empire, invading various places in India , Pakistan, Afghanistan and China, conquering them successfully. Kanishka's empire was certainly vast. It extended from southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, north of the Amu Darya (Oxus) in the north west to Northern India, as far as Mathura in the south east (the Rabatak inscription even claims he held Pataliputra and Sri Champa), and his territory also included Kashmir, where there was a town Kanishkapur named after him not far from the Baramulla Pass. ==Conquests== ===Conquest of Eastern India=== Kanishka's empire likely extended eastward to Sarnath, where inscriptions suggest it served as the provincial capital for the region. Evidence, including Kushana coins found in Bihar and surrounding areas, supports the idea that his empire reached this far. A Buddhist text from 472 AD also mentions a ruler who defeated Pataliputra's king, indicating a Buddhist influence during Kanishka's reign. Kushana coins discovered at sites like Pataliputra, Ranchi, and Tamluk suggest Kanishka controlled Bihar, with his successor Huvishka likely continuing this influence. Before the Kushanas, the Maroundai tribe, possibly linked to the Murundas, ruled the Ganges Valley. Kanishka's title \"Murodasa Marjhakasa\" may reflect his conquest of the Murundas. The extent of Kushana rule in the east and southeast is unclear, but some scholars propose that \"Puri Kushana\" coins were issued by exiled Murunda tribes after the Gupta Empire expanded. While the link between the Murundas and Kushanas is debated, it is likely that Kushana influence persisted in the region after their conquest. ===Central Asian Campaigns=== Sten Konow suggested that Kanishka's conquests began in the Ganges region before returning west to Khotan, where he and his successors were recognized as rulers. Hiuen-Tsang described Kanishka as ruling a vast territory, including areas beyond the Tsung-ling mountains, and keeping Central Asian princes as hostages. Prof. Bailey linked a king named Chandra-Kanishka in Bahlaka (Khotan) to Kanishka, suggesting his empire extended to Balkh and Khotan. There is evidence of Kushan control in areas like Wakhan and Kharasalera, as seen in donations made during Huvishka's reign. Though Huvishka's conquests are unclear, he likely inherited control over Kashmir. The identification of Kanishka with the king Chandra in the Mehrauli Pillar inscription is debated. Overall, Kanishka likely conquered Kashmir and either returned to Khotan or expanded further, as suggested by Hiuen-Tsang. The Kushan Empire expanded into Central Asia. They took control of important trade routes along the Silk Road. At the same time, the Han Empire pulled back from Central Asia. This led to the decline of the last remaining Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Scythian kingdoms. Buddhism, and later Hinduism, spread into Central Asia. ===War with Parthian Empire=== A Buddhist text, Fu fazang yinyuan zhuan (付法藏因緣傳), translated into Chinese in 470 CE, recounts a conflict between the Kushan Emperor Kanishka I and the Eastern Parthian King, likely Vologases III. The text, found in the Historical Tales section of the Tripiṭaka, describes the Parthians launching an attack with a large force of cavalry, infantry, and archers, possibly aiming to reclaim lands lost to the Kushans. In response, Kanishka led a counteroffensive that culminated in a brutal battle, resulting in the exaggerated death toll of 900,000 Parthians. Despite the fierce fighting, Kanishka emerged victorious. The narrative underscores the cruelty of the Parthian king, highlighting Kanishka's actions as a response to his adversary’s stubbornness and aggression. ===Expedition against Han Dynasty=== Kanishka planned a second expedition against China, targeting Ban Yong, the son of Ban Chao. The campaign was successful, and Ban Yong was defeated. As a result, Kanishka took control of the regions of Kashgar, Yarkhand, and Khotan from the Han Empire. His empire then expanded to include areas from Central Asia to Central India, covering regions like Gandhara, Kashmir, and the Pamir Mountains. ===Conquests of Western India=== Kanishka's rule over parts of Western India, including Sindh, is suggested by the Sui-vihar inscription and Kushana-inscribed potsherds found in Baluchistan. Some scholars, like Sten Konow, believe local rulers like Yola Mira might have been Kushana vassals. However, this raises a question: how could Kanishka control the Lower Indus Valley while Rudradaman was independently ruling Sindh. The Junagarh inscription shows Rudradaman as an independent ruler, leading some to think that Kanishka’s control came after Rudradaman’s death. This would also explain the overlap of territories, such as Väśishka’s rule over Sanchi in 28 A.D. While evidence for Kushana rule in South India is uncertain, the lack of mention in records of Gautamiputra and Rudradaman suggests the Kushanas were either ignored or seen as part of the same foreign threat. In summary, Kanishka likely ruled the region after Rudradaman’s death, with his reign beginning around 144 A.D. ==Related pages== *Conquests of Kujula Kadphises *Mauryan Conquest of South *Mauryan reconquest of South == References == Category:Ancient India Category:Kushan Empire Category:Wars involving Asia",
