 "text": "Acadia is the name of a territory in northeastern North America. Today, the area is mostly part of Canada. At the time, Great Britain and France fought over the territory. France said that it had a legitimate claim, because Giovanni da Verrazzano and Jacques Cartier had done expeditions in the area. The British claim was founded on an expedition of Giovanni Caboto. The borders of the territory had never been defined clearly. Both empires often fought over where the borders were. Historically, Acadia covered what is now Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island and the southern part of the Gasp√© Peninsula, which is in Quebec. What is now northeastern Maine was also part of Acadia. Category:History of Canada Category:Former colonies in North America",
