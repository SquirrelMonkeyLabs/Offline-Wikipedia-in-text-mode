 "text": "Too Cool was a professional wrestling tag team and stable that competed in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1998 until 2001. The members of the tag team were Scott Taylor/Scotty 2 Hotty and Brian Christopher/Grandmaster Sexay. Rikishi joined in late 1999 to make Too Cool a stable. The members of the stable were portrayed as hip hop fans and they would be dancing around the ring while lights flashed and music played. This also included a famous moment when all three members entered the Royal Rumble and Rikishi eliminated all the participants in the ring except Sexay. Rikishi looked like he was going to eliminate Sexay but Scotty entered the match next and they danced to their music while the Rumble match was still ongoing. Rikishi eliminated the other two members when their dance segment was over. They quickly became very popular with fans. On the January 6, 2014 episode of Raw titled Old School Raw, Too Cool reunited with Rikishi and they defeated 3MB (Heath Slater, Drew McIntyre and Jinder Mahal) in a six-man tag team match. It marked the first time in thirteen and a half years that all three members of Too Cool had competed in a six-man tag team match. Scotty and Sexay also competed at NXT Arrival in a match for the NXT Tag Team Championships against The Ascension but they were unable to win the titles. They performed on independent circuit shows until Christopher committed suicide on July 29, 2018. == Championships and accomplishments == * World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment ** WWF Intercontinental Championship (1 time) - Rikishi ** WWF Light Heavyweight Championship (1 time) - Scotty ** WWF Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Scotty and Sexay ** WWE Tag Team Championship (1 time) - Scotty and Rikishi ==References== == Other websites == *Grandmaster Sexay's Online World Of Wrestling profile *Scotty 2 Hotty's Online World Of Wrestling profile *Rikishi's WWE profile Category:WWE teams and stables",
