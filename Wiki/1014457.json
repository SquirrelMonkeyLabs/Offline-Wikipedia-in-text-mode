 "text": "The Austro-Prussian War (also known by many other names like the Seven Weeks' War, German Civil War, Brothers War or Fraternal War, known in Germany as (\"German War\"), (; \"German war of brothers\")) was a war fought in 1866 between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. Each side was helped by many allies in the German Confederation. Prussia had also allied with the Kingdom of Italy. This connected the conflict to the Third Independence War of Italian unification. The Austro-Prussian War was part of the rivalry between Austria and Prussia. It ended with Prussian control over the German states. The biggest result of the war was a change in power over the German states away from Austrian and towards Prussian hegemony. The German Confederation was ended and replaced by the North German Confederation. Italy also took the Austrian province of Venetia after the war. The war started when Prussian troops invaded Schleswig-Holstein. The region had been disputed between Prussia and Austria ever since it was taken by them from Denmark. Prussia then invaded Hanover, Saxony, and the Electorate of Hesse on 15 June. Italy declared war on Austria on 20 June. == References == Category:19th century in Germany Category:Wars involving Italy Category:1866 in Europe",
