 "text": "Khubilai Noyon (; died 1211) was a distinguished Mongol commander and one of Genghis Khan's trusted nökers. Alongside Jelme, Jebe, and Subutai, he was renowned as one of the \"Four Hounds\" of Genghis Khan. ==Biography== Born into the Barlas tribe, Khubilai joined Genghis Khan's ranks in 1189 when the Khan established his own ulus, attracting members from various Mongolian clans and tribes, including Khubilai and his brother Qudos Qalǰa. Khubilai quickly proved himself as a skilled and loyal military leader to Genghis Khan. Notably, after the campaign against the Tatar confederation in 1202, Khubilai and Jebe were tasked with pursuing Genghis Khan's disobedient relatives, Altan, Daritai, and Khuchar, who had defied orders and committed robbery. Two years later, Khubilai played a crucial role in the war against the Naimans, excelling in reconnaissance and participating in the victorious Battle of Chakirmaut against Tayang Khan's forces in the Altai Mountains. In recognition of his military prowess, Khubilai was appointed as a noyon of a mingghan during Genghis Khan's Kurultai in 1206, entrusted with overseeing all military affairs of the Mongol Empire.[4] In 1210, he was tasked with subduing the Karluks and presented their ruler, Arslan Khan, to Genghis Khan, who promised one of his daughters in marriage to Arslan as a sign of favor. Khubilai died in 1211 due to illness upon returning to his division. According to Rashid al- Din Hamadani, Khubilai's sons continued to serve the Mongol khans faithfully. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:12th-century births Category:1211 deaths Category:Mongolian people",
