At the time of his birth, Alfonso served as a representative from the 1st district of Cagayan. He was baptized into the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayan) as Juanito Furagganan. He converted to Roman Catholicism at age 20. As a young man, he was reunited with his father in the City of Manila and took his secondary education at Saint James Academy in Malabon, Rizal. His father took legal steps in changing his name to Juan Ponce Enrile, the name that he would use for his pre-law enrollment. == Bibliography == * ==Notes== ==References== ==Other websites== * *Juan Ponce Enrile â€“ Senate of the Philippines |- |- Category:1924 births Category:Living people Category:Presidents of the Senate of the Philippines Category:Minority leaders of the Senate of the Philippines Category:People from Cagayan Valley Category:Cagayan",
