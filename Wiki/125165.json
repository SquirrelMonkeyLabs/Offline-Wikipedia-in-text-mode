 "text": "Walter Frederick \"Fritz\" Mondale (January 5, 1928 – April 19, 2021) was an American politician and lawyer. He was the 42nd vice president of the United States from 1977 to 1981 under Jimmy Carter. Before becoming vice president, he was a United States senator from Minnesota from 1964 to 1976. He was also the attorney general of Minnesota from 1960 to 1964 and the 24th U.S. ambassador to Japan from 1993 to 1996 under Bill Clinton. Mondale was the Democratic Party nominee for president in 1984. His vice presidential nominee, Geraldine Ferraro, was the first woman to be nominated. He only got a majority of votes in Minnesota and Washington, D.C. He lost to President Ronald Reagan in the other 49 states. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office. He made the role of vice President more important than it once was, by having weekly meetings with President Carter. Mondale died on April 19, 2021, in his sleep at his Minneapolis home at the age of 93. The cause of death was natural causes. ==References== == Other websites == * Congressional biography * Senate Leaders Lecture Series Address * Minnesota Public Radio: Coleman, Mondale debate on eve of election (November 4, 2002) — featuring audio of the 2002 debate * Hubert H.
