The adult male frog is 56 to 68 mm long from nose to rear end, which is large for a frog in Nyctimystes or Litoria. Unlike many tree frogs, it has only a small stripe down its side or no stripe at all. It has green skin with some white on its front legs and rear legs. It has a light brown arc on its ear. Some of the webbing between its toes is purple in color. ==References== Category:Frogs of Oceania",
