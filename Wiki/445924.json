At the time Unger's parents lived in the United States, but Unger's father had suffered a heart attack during a family visit to Brazil. This led to the family staying in Brazil for longer than planned and Unger being born there. When Unger's father recovered, Unger's family went back to New York. Unger grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
