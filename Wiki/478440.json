 "text": "A bikont (\"two flagellae\") is any eukaryotic organism in the group Bikonta. Many single-celled members of the group, and the presumed ancestor, have two flagella. The TSAR supergroup is a group of Bikonts containing telonemia (T), stramenopiles (S), alveolata (A), and rhizaria (R). The SAR supergroup is a group of Bikonts containing stramenopiles (S), alveolata (A), and rhizaria (R). == Enzymes == Another shared trait of bikonts is the fusion of two genes into a single unit. The genes for thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) code for a single protein with two functions. The genes are separately translated in unikonts. == References == Category:Eukaryotes",
