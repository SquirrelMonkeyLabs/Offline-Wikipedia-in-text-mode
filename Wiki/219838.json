A teacher and groundskeeper at Hogwarts, the school that Harry Potter attends, Hagrid is a friend of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Hagrid is also a \"half-giant.\" His father was not a giant, whereas his mother, Fridwulfa, who abandoned him when he was just an infant, was a giantess. He has a half-brother named Grawp. In the Harry Potter movies, Hagrid was played by Robbie Coltrane. Martin Bayfield appears as a young Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Over the course of the Harry Potter books, Hagrid is expelled from Hogwarts after The Ministry of Magic thought he had opened the Chamber of Secrets. But the truth that he had been framed by Tom Riddle is exposed and Hagrid is allowed to remain at the school as gamekeeper. The government broke his wand and banned him from doing magic when he was expelled, but he keeps pieces of the wand in his pink umbrella. Hagrid, who keeps several pets, is also a friend of Madame Olympe Maxime, headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, although it is not known if they were together in a romantic way.
