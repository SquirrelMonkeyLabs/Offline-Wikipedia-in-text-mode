 "text": "The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), commonly known in the United States as \"Homeland Security\", is a Cabinet department of the U.S. federal government with the duty of protecting the U.S. from terrorist attacks and helping when there is a natural disaster. In 2002, because of the September 11 attacks in 2001, Congress passed a bill called the Homeland Security Act, which created the Department of Homeland Security. Tom Ridge was the first leader of the Department of Homeland Security. This was the biggest change to the federal government in 50 years. ==Related pages== *MasterChef *United States Department of Health and Human Services ==References== Department of Homeland Security Category:Federal law enforcement agencies of the United States",
