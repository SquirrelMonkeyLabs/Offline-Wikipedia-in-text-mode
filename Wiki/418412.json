The southern end is at the toll plaza for New York State Thruway (I-87) exit 23\\. The location of the northern end is unclear. Some sources say it is at 8th Street in Troy. Other sources say it is at its interchange with NY 7 and NY 787 in the town of Colonie. The route is long if extended to Troy, or without the NY 7 overlap. North of NY 7, the highway continues as NY 787 to the city of Cohoes. ==References== Category:Interstate Highways Category:Roads in New York (state)",
