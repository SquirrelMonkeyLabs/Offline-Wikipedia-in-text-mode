 "text": "A (from German \"poltern\", which means \"rumble\" or \"make noise\", and \"geist\", which means \"ghost\", \"spirit\" or \"embodiment\") is a spirit or ghost that is able to move and influence objects. Poltergeists are said to be invisible. Poltergeists are said to bother only one person at a time. This person is called their \"focus\". They are said to only last a few weeks, then will move on to another target. Often poltergeists are reported around children and adolescents. Some scientists think that poltergeists only exist in a person's head as a result of psychokinesis. They think that the \"poltergeist effect\" is a result of mental trauma. == Media == There is a 1982 movie called Poltergeist. In Harry Potter there is a poltergeist named Peeves. However, Peeves is not a classic poltergeist. He can be seen and does not focus on bothering just one person. == References == == Other websites == * Poltergeist: The Legacy Website * Dehaunting Techniques * International Journal of Parapsychology * Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research * Skeptic's Dictionary * 1926 silent short film of the Eleonora Zugun poltergeist case On YouTube, with German title cards.
