 "text": "Samudaya sacca is the second of the four noble truths in Buddhism. It is about the origins of dukkha (suffering). == Etymology == Samudaya has many meanings, but it usually means \"origin\" or \"source.\" Sacca means \"truth\" or \"reality.\" So because of this, Samudaya sacca means \"truth of the origin of suffering.\" == Within the four noble truths == According to the Four Noble Truths, the origin (Samudaya) of suffering (sacca) is from cravings taught by ignorance. The craving is shown in three ways: * Craving for objects that give pleasurable feelings, or craving for sensory pleasures. * Craving to dominate others. * Craving to be away from the world because of painful feelings. == References == Category:Buddhism",
