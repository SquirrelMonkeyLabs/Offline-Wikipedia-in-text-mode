 "text": "The Soviet deportations of Chechens and Ingush were a series of deportations conducted by Joseph Stalin's totalitarian regime in the later stage of World War II after the Soviet Red Army retook the part of Chechnya previously occupied by Nazi Germany. * * * The deportations saw 400,000 Chechens and 91,250 Ingush expelled from the area within eight days. ==Events== Fearing that the Chechnya's mountainous terrain favors guerrilla war, the Soviets entrapped the Chechens and Ingush by inviting them to join the Red Army Day celebrations on February 23, 1944. Once they showed up, they were arrested by soldiers armed with machine guns. The Chechen and Ingush deportees were sent to camps across Central Asia and Siberia. They were not allowed to return to Chechnya until 1957. ==Impact== The Chechens and Ingush lost as much as 33% of their total pre-war population under the Soviet invasion. This is around the same percentage of population that Cambodia lost during the Cambodian genocide (1975‒79) under the pro-Soviet Khmer Rouge regime. * * * * * The deportations have however received little attention from left-wing scholars in the West, who have substantial influence in academia and history writing. * Lappin, Shalom (2006), ‘How Class Disappeared from Western Politics’, Dissent, Vol. 51, No. 1, pp. 73-78. * * * * Kirsch, Adam (2024), On Settler Colonialism: Ideology, Violence, and Justice, W.W. Norton and Company, New York and London. * * * * * ==Academic views== Despite not comparable to the Holocaust, some historians classify the Soviet deportations of Chechens and Ingush as a genocide, just as the many other crimes against humanity committed by the Soviet Union. * * \"In the 1939-1941 period alone, Soviet-inflicted suffering on all citizens in Poland exceeded that of Nazi-inflicted suffering on all citizens. (...) The Soviet-imposed myth about \"Communist heroes of resistance\" enabled them for decades to avoid the painful questions faced long ago by other Western countries.\" Johanna Granville, H-Net Review of Jan T.
