In August 2009, Lindberg left Pennywise and was replaced by Ignite singer Zoli Téglás. Until his return several years later. Pennywise has released ten studio albums. After releasing two EPs in 1989, the band signed to Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz) in 1990. Their two first albums were not very successful.
