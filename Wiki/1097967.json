It was released on November 15, 2001 in North America. It was only released in North America for the Xbox. The game has both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 with some updates. The game features 24 levels, with 5 of them being originals for Pro Skater 2x. ==Reception== The game was well liked by game critics. Critics said that they liked the graphics and visuals. However, critics didn't like that there wasn't that much outside of the updated graphics and that it felt a little outdated with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 releasing soon after it. It was nominated for Best Sports, Alternative Game on GameSpot's Best and Worst Awards in 2001. It would lose to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. ==References== Category:2001 video games Category:Tony Hawk video games Category:Activision video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Neversoft games Category:Treyarch games Category:Skateboarding video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in France Category:Xbox games Category:Xbox-only games",
