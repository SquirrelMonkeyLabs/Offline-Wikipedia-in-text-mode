 "text": "A brooch is a piece of jewelry that is attached to clothes. It is usually made of metal, silver or gold but sometimes bronze and decorated with gemstones. Brooches called \"fibulae\" were used for many centuries to fasten clothing. In recent centuries people more often use buttons and belts for that, so brooches have become only decorative.
