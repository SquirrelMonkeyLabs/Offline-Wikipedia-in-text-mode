They were best known as the in-house band on the show Music Panorama on NTA Benin and toured with fellow reggae group The Mandators. Jastix were also session musicians for upcoming reggae singer Edi Rasta, who would later be known as Evi-Edna Ogholi. Majek Fashek attracted international attention, when his self-penned tune, “Send Down The Rain,” appeared to coax a rainstorm that ended one among the worst droughts in Nigeria's history. Labeled a “prophet”, Fashek went on to become one among Africa’s greatest reggae-influenced performers. His debut solo album, Prisoner Of Conscience, released in 1988, sold quite 200,000 copies in Nigeria alone. Fashek died in his sleep on 2 June 2020 in New York City from esophageal cancer, aged 57. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Deaths from esophageal cancer Category:Cancer deaths in New York City Category:Nigerian singer- songwriters Category:Nigerian guitarists Category:Nigerian writers Category:People from Edo State",
