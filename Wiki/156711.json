 "text": "In computing, the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is an application- layer Internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to get e-mail from a remote mail server over a TCP/IP connection. POP3 and IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol) are the two most widely accepted Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval. Almost all modern e-mail clients and servers support both. Many years ago, a proposal was outlined for a POP4 specification, complete with a working server implementation. The proposed POP4 extension adds basic folder management, multipart message support, as well as message flag management, allowing for a light protocol which supports some popular IMAP features which POP3 lacks. No progress has been found in the POP4 specification since 2003. == Related Requests For Comments (RFCs) == * RFC 1939 – Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (STD 53) * RFC 1957 – Some Observations on Implementations of the Post Office Protocol (POP3) * RFC 2195 – IMAP/POP AUTHorize Extension for Simple Challenge/Response * RFC 2384 – POP URL Scheme * RFC 2449 – POP3 Extension Mechanism * RFC 2595 – Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP * RFC 3206 – The SYS and AUTH POP Response Codes * RFC 5034 – The Post Office Protocol (POP3) Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Authentication Mechanism ==Related pages== * Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) * Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) * E-mail client * Webmail * POP3 clients: getmail, fetchmail * Email encryption Category:Computer protocols Category:E-mail",
