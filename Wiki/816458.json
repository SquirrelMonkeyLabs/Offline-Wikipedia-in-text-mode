Session · 1982 == Etymology == In Meitei language (Manipuri language), the female first name \"Laikhurembi\" can be split up into three parts, \"Lai\", \"Khu\" and \"-rembi\". The Meitei language word \"Lai\" has multiple meanings. It may mean a god or a deity or a spirit or a disease or a picture or a painting in noun form. \"Lai\" may mean easy in adjective form in Meitei language. The Meitei language term \"Khu\" also has many meanings. It may mean \"narrow\" or \"not wide\" in adjective form. It may mean a knee in noun form. It may mean \"to kneel\" or \"to cough\" in verbal form. According to \"The History Of Manipur\" written by Wahengbam Ibohal, the words \"Lai\" and \"Khu\" are the names of tribes. The last part \"-rembi\" means chief, head or graceful in feminine form. == History and Origin == According to the Poireiton Khunthok, Laikhurembi () was the chief queen of Thongaren (). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on. Scholars think this queen may have had Asian ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both Lai and Khu people in it. Other scholars think \"Laikhurembi\" is just her title and not her name. Laikhurembi () is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba (, Shan: Hoom Chao Hpa). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), \"Lai-ren\" means \"Chief of Lai\". In Meitei language, the word \"Lai\" has many meanings. Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King Thongaren (). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, Poireiton, instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to Tai Pang Pan and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife Leinaotabi to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife. == Description == The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was Yungyatnaba (lit. erect and sharp) which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her decision wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done (things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement). No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden. == Cult == There is a temple dedicated to Goddess Laikhurembi in Uripok town in Imphal West district of Manipur. During the Lai Haraoba festival of Uripok, a carnival like atmosphere subdues the sacred traditional ritualistic ceremonies. During the noisy possession of the festive occasions, the maibis dance in the gentle melodies of pena. The maibis became possessed by the spirits when the music stopped and they delivered oracles. During this, the audiences listen to them very attentively. == Related pages == * Lainaotabi * Yumjao Leima == References == == Other websites == * Learners' Manipuri-English dictionary.
