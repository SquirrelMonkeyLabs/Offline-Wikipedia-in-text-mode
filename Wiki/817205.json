 "text": "Tupac Huallpa (15th century – 1533) was the fourteenth Sapa Inca. He only ruled for a few months, in the year 1533, after Atahualpa, his half-brother, had been murdered. Tupac Hualpa was the last Inca ruler. He was the son of Sapa Inca Huayna Cápac. Huayana Cápac died in 1527. After that, there was a civil war between Tupac Huallpa and Huáscar, his half-brother. This war ended in 1532, with the victory of Atahualpa. Shortly afterwards Spanish troops led by Francisco Pizarro captured Huascár. Even though a large ransom was paid, Huascar was executed. Tuupac Huallpa was Huasca's younger brother. Atahualpa was executed in 1533, and the Spanish made Tupac Huallpa king of the Incas.
