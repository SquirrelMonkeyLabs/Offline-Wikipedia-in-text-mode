 "text": "Space is a Latin American subscription television channel of Argentine origin. It is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery and operated by WarnerMedia Latin America. The channel is aimed at young people and adults (between 14 and 45 years old). ==History== Space was launched on the air on March 11, 1991 by the company Imagen Satelital of Argentine businessman Alberto Gonz√°lez and was the first 24-hour movie channel in Latin America. The channel's programming, with a strong emphasis on cinema, was made up of films from the United States, Hispanic and international, thematic cinematographic blocks and boxing events. In May 1997, it passed into the hands of Cisneros Television Group (which in 2000 became Claxson Interactive Group when it merged with Ibero American Media Partners and the portal El Sitio), after it acquired Image Satelital. In April 2002, together with a renewal of the image, other entertainment options are included in the programming, such as artistic specials. The channel also begins to be distributed throughout Latin America in July 2009, which until now had had a strong presence in the Southern Cone. This was accompanied by a complete renovation of the corporate image and logo. In 2009, an HD simulcast was launched and, since 2011, has included the option of a second audio track in English. == Other websites == *Official Website (Latin America) Category:Television channels",
