Made bold by Braddock's defeat on July 9, Indians killed and pillaged along the Pennsylvania frontier. Fourteen settlers were killed at Penn's Creek. Eleven were taken captive. One was wounded, but escaped. A posse sent to investigate was attacked, and both posse members and Indians were killed. Some of those taken captive in the Penn's Creek Massacre eventually returned to civilization alive. ==References== * Category:Massacres in the United States Category:18th century in Pennsylvania Category:1755",
