 "text": "The lesbian bar (also called a dyke bar or women's bar) is a bar for lesbians. The lesbian bar has a history different from gay bars. Lesbian bars existed before queer community centers, health care centers and coffee shops. For a long time, lesbian bars were places of community and validation. Women were historically barred from public spaces having alcoholic drinks. The women's saloon presence rose in the 1920s. Mona's 440 Club was the first lesbian bar in the United States. In the 1950s, bars began opening for working class lesbians, Caucasian or African American. Because of not enough economic capital and segregation, house parties were popular with the black lesbians. Lesbian and gay identification and bar culture increased with the migration and passing through of people in big cities during and after World War II. In the 1970s, lesbian feminism began. Bars became important community activist spaces. ==References== Category:Places where alcohol is served Category:LGBT",
