 "text": "The German capital Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs (German: Stadtteile/ Bezirke). The boroughs are called Bezirke in German. The 12 boroughs have political rights like a town community but they are not a legal city. On January 1, 2001 there was a Berlin borough reform. The reform cut the number of Berlin's boroughs from 23 to 12. This was the result of combining several of the old boroughs. The reform was done in order to cut down administration costs. Here are the old and the new boroughs: New borough name Old borough names Area Population I Mitte Mitte, Tiergarten, Wedding 320,420 II Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg 256,419 III Pankow Prenzlauer Berg, Weißensee, Pankow 348,412 IV Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf Charlottenburg, Wilmersdorf 315,054 V Spandau Spandau (unchanged) 225,856 VI Steglitz-Zehlendorf Steglitz, Zehlendorf 288,285 VII Tempelhof-Schöneberg Tempelhof, Schöneberg 335,171 VIII Neukölln Neukölln (unchanged) 306,214 IX Treptow-Köpenick Treptow, Köpenick 233,923 X Marzahn-Hellersdorf Marzahn, Hellersdorf 252,602 XI Lichtenberg Lichtenberg, Hohenschönhausen 258,455 XII Reinickendorf Reinickendorf (unchanged) 246,118 (the data in the table is March 2004)",
