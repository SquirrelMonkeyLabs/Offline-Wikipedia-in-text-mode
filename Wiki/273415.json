 "text": "The Medical University of Innsbruck (German: Medizinische Universität Innsbruck) is a university in Innsbruck, Austria. It used to be one of the four historical faculties of the Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck, but it became an independent (by itself) university in 2004. == History == The medical tradition dates back long before the university began. The first hospital began in the silver-mining city of Schwaz nearby in 1307. Because people grew as years went by, a medical faculty was added to the university, begun in 1669 by Emperor Leopold I, making it the first of its kind in the Alpine region. == Nobel Prize laureates == * Fritz Pregl, 1923 (chemistry - for his contributions to quantitative organic microanalysis) * Adolf Windhaus, 1928 (chemistry - for his work on sterols and their relation to vitamins) * Hans Fischer, 1930 (chemistry - for the synthesis of haemin) == Other websites == * * Study in Austria: A Guide Category:Colleges and universities in Austria Category:Innsbruck Category:2004 establishments in Europe Category:2000s establishments in Austria Category:Medical education",
