 "text": "Benzonatate (other names Tessalon, Perles, Zonatuss) is an antitussive (cough suppressant) medicine used to help with coughing and hiccups. It is taken by mouth. People under ten years old should not use it. It starts working after around twenty minutes, and can last eight hours. It can cause side effects such as being tired or dizzy, having stomach aches, or having hallucinations. It can also cause allergic reactions. Having too much benzonatate can cause seizures, heartbeats that are not normal (Arrhythmia), or even death. Chewing benzonatate capsules instead of just swallowing them can cause spasms in the lungs and shock. It is not known if people who are pregnant or breastfeeding can use the drug. It works by numbing some nerves in the lungs. Benzonatate was allowed to be used as a medicine in the United States in 1958. In 2020, there were over 3 million prescriptions for the drug. == References == Category:Drugs",
