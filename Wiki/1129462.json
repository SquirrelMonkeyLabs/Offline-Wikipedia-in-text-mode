 "text": "Generative artificial intelligence or generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to create new things. This can include writing words, creating pictures, videos, and music. A generative AI model learns how to do this by studying large amounts of example information (called data) that is given to it in a process called \"training\". This process lets it create new things that are similar to the information it studied. ChatGPT is one famous type of generative AI. Generative AI's are not alive and can not think for themselves like a person, but the text and videos they create can sometimes trick people into thinking that the AI is alive. ==Related pages== * Generative adversarial networks ==References==",
