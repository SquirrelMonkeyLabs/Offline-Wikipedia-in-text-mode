It wasn't released as a separate single, so it was the 12-inch single (L12Bong4) that entered the Dutch chart. Officially it was not allowed in the singles charts as the 12-inch had been sold (and priced) as a mini-LP in the weeks before that. But due to its popularity on the radio, \"Just Can't Get Enough (live)\" was allowed to enter and duly became Depeche Mode's biggest Dutch hit of all time. ==References== Category:1983 songs Category:Depeche Mode songs Category:Synth-pop songs",
