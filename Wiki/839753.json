 "text": "Yalkaparidon is an extinct genus of Australian marsupials, first described in 1988 and known only from the Oligo-Miocene deposits of Riversleigh, northwestern Queensland, Australia. A detailed study on its morphology, including newly-referred tarsal material published in 2014 found that it was likely a crown group marsupial, and probably an australidelphian, but its unusual morphology made its precise placement uncertain. ==References== Category:Marsupials Category:Marsupials of Australia",
