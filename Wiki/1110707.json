 "text": "The Invasion of Yugoslavia, was an invasion by the Axis powers against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that happened from 6 April 1941 - 17 April 1941. == History == on 25 March 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact and joined the Axis powers. But two days later the axis government was overthrown and replaced with an Allied government. This enraged Hitler (the dictator of the Third Reich) and so the axis powers invaded on 6 April. There were 19 German divisions, 22 Italian divisions, and the Hungarian 3rd army. Belgrade fell on 12 April and 5 days later Yugoslavia surrendered. After the invasion, parts of Yugoslavia were annexed into Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Italian Albania. During the occupation, resistance movements like Titos Partisans would fight against the axis and would liberate the country in 1945. == References == Category:1941 in Europe Category:Invasions of World War II Category:History of Yugoslavia",
