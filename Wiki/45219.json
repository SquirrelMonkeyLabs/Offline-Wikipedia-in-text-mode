 "text": "Western Europe is a geographic region of Europe. This term does not have an exact definition. Some definitions include countries like Spain and the United Kingdom, while some don't. Its use has changed over time. During the Middle Ages, the European parts of the Western World included those countries following Catholicism or Protestantism. During the Cold War, Western Europe was a geographic and socio-political concept. It meant the democratic European countries of the First World, which are also vaguely defined. It was and still is distinguished from Eastern Europe by differences of economics, politics, and religion. At its widest medieval definition, it includes the following 23 countries: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Many, such as Norway, are also in Northern Europe or in Central Europe or Southern Europe. Today, the term \"Western Europe\" has to do with geography and with economics. The concept is commonly associated with liberal democracy, socialism and also with the European Union, though that also has some countries of Eastern Europe. Most of the countries in the region share Western culture, and many have economic, and political ties with countries in North and South America and Oceania. In addition, Scandinavia (in Northern Europe) is commonly associated with social democracy and remains fairly neutral throughout international disputes. The Iberian Peninsula, the most western part of Europe is similarly closely linked to the Americas. It is a monotonous area with long and irregular coastlines. ==References== Category:Regions of Europe",
