They play their home games in Calgary, Alberta at the Scotiabank Saddledome. They are the AHL affiliate for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (AHL). Their ECHL affiliate is the Rapid City Rush. The team originally played in Stockton, California as the Stockton Heat from 2015 to 2022. During the 2020–21 season, the Heat would play in the newly created Canadian Division, which was made because of border restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Heat played in the division because they were the affiliate of the Calgary Flames. On May 23, 2022, the Flames announced that the Heat would stop playing in Stockton and would move to Calgary, Alberta. The team name Wranglers was chosen to honour a former team played as the Calgary Wranglers in the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1977 until 1987. On October 16, 2022, the team would play their first game as the Calgary Wranglers. They would be defeated by the Coachella Valley Firebirds 6–5. This was also the Firebirds first game. In the 2022–23 season, the Wranglers would finish the season leading the Pacific Division in points. They would make it to the Pacific Division finals but would lose to the Coachella Valley Firebirds three games to two. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2022 establishments in North America Category:2020s establishments in Canada Category:American Hockey League teams Category:Ice hockey teams in Alberta Category:Sports teams in Calgary Category:Calgary Flames",
