 "text": "Backlash (2002) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on April 21, 2002 at the Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri. It was the fourth Backlash event held by the WWF and the first to feature the brand extension, in which the company made their wrestlers exclusive to their weekly television shows Raw and SmackDown!. This was the first time a WWF pay-per-view was held at Kemper Arena since Over The Edge in 1999 where Owen Hart lost his life after he fell to the ring. This was also the last Backlash event before the WWF renamed itself to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on May 6. ==Matches== No. Rsults Stipulations Times 1 Big Show defeated Justin Credible and Steven Richards Handicap match 2:11 2 Tajiri (with Torrie Wilson) defeated Billy Kidman (c) Singles match for the WWF Cruiserweight Championship 9:08 3 Scott Hall (with X-Pac) defeated Bradshaw (with Faarooq) Singles match 5:43 4 Jazz (c) defeated Trish Stratus Singles match for the WWF Women's Championship 4:29 5 Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) defeated Jeff Hardy (with Lita) by referee stoppage Singles match 5:32 6 Kurt Angle defeated Edge Singles match 13:25 7 Eddie Guerrero defeated Rob Van Dam (c) Singles match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship 11:43 8 The Undertaker defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin Singles match to decide the number one contender to the Undisputed WWF Championship with Ric Flair as the special guest referee 27:03 9 Billy and Chuck (c) (with Rico) defeated Maven and Al Snow Tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship 5:58 10 Hollywood Hulk Hogan defeated Triple H (c) Singles match for the Undisputed WWF Championship 22:04 ==References== ==Other websites== *Official Backlash 2002 website Category:2002 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in Kansas City, Missouri Category:WWE Backlash Category:2002 in the United States Category:2000s in Missouri Category:History of Kansas City, Missouri Category:April 2002 events",
