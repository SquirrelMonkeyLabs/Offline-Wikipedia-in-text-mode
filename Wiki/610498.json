 "text": "Parisā (, pronounced pə-REE-sa) is a Persian given name for girls. It means 'like a fairy'. The ancient Persian name \"Parysatis\" () is related to this name. \"Pari\" can be used as a diminutive of Parisa. Pari () (pronounced pər- REE) means \"fairy\" and is used as a name of its own right as well.[2] Pari does not mean angel. \"Fereshteh\" () is a feminine given name which actually happens to mean angel. The Pari (or Peri) in Persian mythology are described to be a race of beautiful and benevolent supernatural fairy beings, earlier regarded as malevolent. Risa (given name) can be used as a nickname also. This is a unique name (not in the top 1000 newborn names in the US in 2021). ==Notable people== ===Historical=== * Parysatis, the wife of Darius I of Persia II, king of the Persian Empire * Parysatis II, the youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III of Persia, who was the wife of Alexander the Great. ===Modern=== * Parisa Damandan, Iranian art historian * Parisa (born Fātemeh Vā'ezi), Iranian singer of Persian classical music ==References== == Other websites == * http://www.behindthename.com/name/parisa * http://www.behindthename.com/name/pari Category:Given names",
