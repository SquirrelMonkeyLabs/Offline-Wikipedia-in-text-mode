Denmark has been to the FIFA Women's World Cup four times and the UEFA Women's Championship nine times. They made it to the final of the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017. During the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017, Denmark was in a group with the Netherlands, Norway, and Belgium. They won against Belgium and Norway by a score of 1-0 each, but they lost to the Netherlands with a score of 1-0. Even though they didn't finish first in their group, they still got to the quarter-finals where they played against Germany. Surprisingly, Denmark won against the team that had been the champions of Europe for 22 years with a score of 2-1. After that, they reached the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, they played against Austria, and the match ended with no goals, so they had to decide the winner with a penalty shootout, which Denmark won 3-0. This was the first time they reached the final. In the final match, they played against the Netherlands in Enschede, in front of a crowd of 28,182 people. However, the Danish team lost 4-2 to the Netherlands, who won their first UEFA Euro title. In March 2007, Denmark was ranked sixth in the FIFA Women's World Rankings, which was their highest ranking ever. Their lowest ranking was 20th place in June 2016. == References == Category:Football in Denmark Category:European women's national association football teams Category:National sports teams of Denmark",
