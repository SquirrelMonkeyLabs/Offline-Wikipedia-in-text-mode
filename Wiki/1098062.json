 "text": "The SIG Sauer P226 is a large handgun made by SIG Sauer. It can be used with four different types of bullets: 9Ã—19mm Parabellum, .40 S&W;, .357 SIG, or .22 Long Rifle. It works in the same way as the SIG Sauer P220, but it can hold more bullets in its magazine because it uses double stack magazines, which fit more bullets than the single stack magazines of the P220. ==References== Category:Pistols",
