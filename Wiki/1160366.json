 "text": "Food engineering is a study and work field that uses ideas from engineering, science, and math to make and manage food. This includes how food is processed, produced, handled, stored, kept fresh, checked, packaged, and delivered. Because it uses food science and other types of engineering like electrical, mechanical, civil, chemical, industrial, and agricultural engineering, food engineering is a mix of many fields and is a small, focused area. Food materials are complex, so food engineering also uses ideas from chemistry and physics, like biochemistry, microbiology, food chemistry, heat, how things move, how substances flow, and how heat is transferred. Food engineers use this knowledge to design and make safe, healthy, tasty, and good-quality food that is affordable. They also create food machines and systems. == References == === Citations === Category:Foods Category:Engineering disciplines",
