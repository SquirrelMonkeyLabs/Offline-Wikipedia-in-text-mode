 "text": "The Buick Rendezvous was a midsize crossover SUV. It was built by General Motors from 2002 to 2007. The Rendezvous was built on a short wheelbase of the GM U platform similar to the Pontiac Aztek. It slotted between the Rainier and the Terraza. From 2002 to 2006, it offered the option of front-wheel-drive or all-wheel drive. This was dropped for the final model year. The Rendezvous was later discontinued due to a drop in sales and replaced by the slightly larger Buick Enclave CUV which also replaced the Rainier and Terraza. ==Other websites== Category:2000s automobiles Rendezvous Category:Sport utility vehicles",
