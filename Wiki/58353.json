 "text": "The PS10 Solar Power Plant () is a solar power plant in Sanlucar la Mayor, Spain. The plant is made up of a tower in the center of a large field covered in many mirrors. Each of the 624 moveable mirrors has an area of 120 m2 (1290 ft2). The mirrors reflect the light from the Sun to the top of the tower. The heat warms water within pipes in the central tower turning it into steam. The steam drives turbines which, at their peak, put out 11 MW of electricity. The planet is good for providing electricity during the hottest parts of the day when air conditioning demand is the highest. ==Related pages== *Solar power *Power station *Electricity == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Spain Category:Solar power plants Category:2007 establishments in Europe Category:2000s establishments in Spain",
