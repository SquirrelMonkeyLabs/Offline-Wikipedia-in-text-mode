The show began in 1983 as a local New York City program called The Morning Show, hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey (then the wife of Major League Baseball player Steve Garvey).Show Page. A year later, Garvey left the show and was replaced by Ann Abernathy. In 1985, after Abernathy married and moved to Los Angeles, Kathie Lee Gifford became Philbin's co-host. The show went into national syndication in 1988 as Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee. Gifford left the show in 2000; the show continued as Live! with Regis while Philbin and the show's producers teamed him with several potential co-hosts. In 2001, Ripa was named as Philbin's co-host, with the show then being renamed Live! with Regis and Kelly. Philbin and Ripa remained a team until 2011; in January of that year, he announced he was leaving the show, with his last show airing on November 18. The show then became Live! with Kelly, with Ripa appearing with a wide array of guest co- hosts. Former New York Giants star defensive lineman Strahan became the new full-time co-host effective with the 2012â€“13 season premiere. At that point the show became Live! with Kelly and Michael. Live!'s mixture of A-list guests and the interaction between co-hosts have made it one of daytime's most popular and venerable talk shows. In 2016, Strahan announced he was leaving the show to join Good Morning America. Ryan Seacrest began hosting in 2017, prompting the show's name change to \"Live! with Kelly and Ryan\". Seacrest left in April of 2023 and was replaced by Ripa's husband, Mark Consuelos, soon afterward. ==References== ==Other websites== * * Category:American television talk shows Category:First run syndicated television programs Category:English- language television programs",
