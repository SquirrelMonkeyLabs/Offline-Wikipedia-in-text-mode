 "text": "Iquiri National Forest (Floresta Nacional do Iquiri) is a forest in Brazil. It is in the state of Amazonas. It is a sustainable use conservation unit. This means that people are allowed to come to the forest to cut down some trees for wood to build with, but not as much as in other forests. ==Place== The Iquiri National Forest is in size. It is in the town place of Lábrea in Amazonas. The Iquiri National Forest is in the Amazon. The forest is 73.05% dense rainforest, where the trees grow very close together, and 26.95% open rainforest, where the trees grow further apart. The forest grows wood for building and other things that human beings like: oils, resins, nuts, seeds and fruits. ==History== The government of Brazil made Iquiri into a National Forest on 8 May 2008. The Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) watches and runs the forest. The IUCN says the forest is a type VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). This means that people can take resources and other good things from the forest as long as they do not take too much too fast. It also means scientists may go to the forest to study it. The government passed a rule on 9 January 2012 saying people had to work together to make management plans for places in the BR-319 area of influence. These are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuniã Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari, and Mapinguari national parks, Balata-Tufari, Humaitá, and Iquiri national forests, and the Lago do Capanã-Grande, Rio Ituxi, Médio Purus, and Lago do Cuniã reserves. An advisory council for the Iquiri forest was created on 26 October 2012. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * Category:National parks in Brazil Category:Amazonas (Brazil)",
