Nick Carraway, a man who grew up in the American Midwest, is the narrator. Nick is a World War I veteran and a Yale University graduate who wants a more exciting life. He moves to New York, to be a bonds salesman. There, he rents a house in the small community of West Egg. The person living next to him is Jay Gatsby, a strange man who also has a lot of money. Jay Gatsby also hosts many expensive parties frequently. Strangely, he never joins in his own parties. Because people don't know him, many rumors are made about Gatsby's true identity and background. Nick drives out to visit his cousin Daisy in East Egg. There, he meets her husband, Tom Buchanan. He is also introduced to her friend, Jordan Baker. Nick learns from her that Tom has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick decides to hold his judgment. Later in the summer, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties. He meets Gatsby there.

He spends many nights looking across the water from his mansion at the green light from Daisy's dock. He is hoping that he can impress Daisy with his rich lifestyle and wild parties. Gatsby grew up very poor and with little chance to move up in the world. This made Gatsby try to get much money to become a different person. If he is rich, he thinks he will be right for Daisy. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange a meeting between Daisy and himself. Nick invites them both over for tea, and they begin to fall in love again. They then start an affair with each other. After a short time, Tom notices that Daisy and Gatsby are in love. The group meets at a hotel, where Daisy is forced to choose between Gatsby and Tom.
