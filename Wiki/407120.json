 "text": "Bloody Sunday took place in Russia in 1905. More than 3,000 people marched towards the Winter Palace in hopes of presenting Tsar Nicholas II a petition for reform, however he was not present at the palace. Without the order of the tsar to stop them, the army shot their rifles into the crowd, leaving 96 dead and around 300 wounded. This event began the Russian Revolution of 1905 which was caused in part by defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. Many thousands died and the Tsar created the State Duma to represent the Russian people. It is considered a cause of the later, larger Russian Revolution. Later Dmitri Shostakovich composed his 11th Symphony based on this event. Bloody Sunday is also known as a massacre. The Winter Palace is where the Tsar spent his winter holidays. ==References== Category:Russian Revolution Category:1905 Category:Saint Petersburg Category:Massacres in Europe Category:20th-century protests",
