 "text": "Mount Oread is a hill in Lawrence, Kansas. The University of Kansas is on it. It is on the water divide between the Kansas and Wakarusa rivers. It was named after the Oread Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. The hill was first called Hogback Ridge by many Lawrence residents until the Oread name was chosen in 1866. For emigrants going west by wagon train on the Oregon Trail, \"The Hill\" was the next big topographical challenge after crossing the Wakarusa River near today's Haskell Indian Nations University. The United States Geological Survey says that Mount Oread is about above sea level. Downtown Lawrence is about above sea level.
