 "text": "Proceratosaurus was a small dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic, about 165 million years ago. It was found in Gloucestershire, England, in 1910. It was a carnivorous theropod. Proceratosaurus was first believed to be an early ancestor of Ceratosaurus, but it was actually an ancestor of the coelurosaurs. Thus, it was an early ancestor of Tyrannosaurus and its relatives in the Upper Cretaceous.Holtz, Thomas 1998. A new phylogeny of the carnivorous dinosaurs.
