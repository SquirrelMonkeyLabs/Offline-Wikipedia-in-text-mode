 "text": "CD-i was a CD-based data storage format that was mostly created by Philips. It was designed to hold programs, similar to CD-ROM. The first CD-i player, the CDI 910/205, was released by Philips in 1991. Along with consoles such as the FM Towns Marty and the Amiga CDTV, the CD-i is one of the first CD-based consoles. The CD-i was a bit of a commercial failure, but still had a long lifespan, with the last one being made in 1998. Its last game, Solar Crusade, released in 1999. The reason for its failure was most likely due to a lack of third party support, poorly received games, and a high selling price. == References == Category:Video game consoles",
