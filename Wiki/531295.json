He wrote essays critical of poets of the 1960s in his book Mulaqatein. This book made many poets angry, including Sahir Ludhianvi, Ali Sardar Jafri and Kaifi Azmi. As a result, he was boycotted in some poetic sessions. He recently wrote columns for the BBC Hindi website on various contemporary issues and literature. Fazli died of a heart attack in Mumbai on 8 February 2016. He was aged 77. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2014 deaths Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:Urdu poets Category:21st-century Indian poets",
