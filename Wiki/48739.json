Benjamin and Haas became two-time WWE Tag Team Championship twice. Benjamin then was drafted to Raw and won the WWE Intercontinental Championship after he defeated then-champion Chris Jericho at the 2004 Taboo Tuesday. In 2006, he was part of a storyline where he was on a losing streak for many weeks which led his \"momma\" (played by actress Thea Vidale) to come to Raw to insult him. She assisted him in matches and sometimes interfered in them. She was taken off television when she was (kayfabe) undergoing heart surgery in the hospital and never returned to WWE. In 2007, Benjamin started wearing gold attire and dyed his hair blond. He also began referring to himself as \"The Gold Standard\".
