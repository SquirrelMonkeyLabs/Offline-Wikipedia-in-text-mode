 "text": "Frequency hopping spread spectrum is a method of transmitting data wirelessly, using many different frequencies. After a given time, the transmitter and receiver change the frequency on which they transmit the signal.

It is one of the technologies generally referred to as Spread spectrum. Category:Radio technology",
