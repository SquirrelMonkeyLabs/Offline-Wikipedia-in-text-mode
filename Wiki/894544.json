 "text": "Hammond's rice rat (Mindomys hammondi) is a species of rodent. It is very rare. It only occurs in Ecuador, where it has been found at two, possibly three sites. Between 1913 and 1980 only eight animal samples were collected. The IUCN Red List says this species is endangered because the place where it lives is very small and human beings have changed that place so much by building cities there. ==References== Category:Rodents Category:Endangered species Category:IUCN Red List endangered species Category:Mammals of South America",
