 "text": "Rabb's fringe-limbed tree frog (Ecnomiohyla rabborum) is a frog that lives in Panama. Scientists have seen it between 900 and 1150 meters above sea level in cloud forests near a town called El Valle de Anton. Scientists think this frog might be extinct. The adult male frog is 62 to 97 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 61 to 100 mm long. This frog is either brown or brown and green in color. It lives high in the trees. It can use the skin on its legs to glide on the air when it jumps. The male frog finds a hole in the tree that has water in it. He sings for the female frogs. More than one female frog may come to lay eggs in the same hole. The female lays 60-200 eggs at a time. She puts the eggs just under the surface of the water so that they stick to the wood. The tadpoles hatch and swim in the water. Scientists think the male frog feeds them. They have seen the male frog sit in the water. It looks like the tadpoles eat small bites out of his skin. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis can kill this frog with disease. Scientists first saw this fungus on the frogs in 2006. In 2007, the scientists found only one frog living in the area. The scientists found no frogs at all in 2008 or any year after that. People had brought some frogs to a zoo in Atlanta, Georgia. The zoo frogs did not have living young, even though human beings tried to help. The last frog, a female named \"Toughie,\" died in 2016. The frog is named after George and Mary Rabb, two people who liked to save frogs. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
