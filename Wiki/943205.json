 "text": "The Zambia women's national football team plays football for Zambia. They are called the Copper Queens and are ranked 81st in the world. Zambia also has a team for the Homeless World Cup. The country takes part in tournaments to qualify for the FIFA Women's World Cup and other African football tournaments. Zambia is the first African country without a coast to qualify for a senior World Cup for men or women. They will make their first appearance in the FIFA Women's World Cup. == History == The Zambia women's national football team is known as the Copper Queens. Back in 1985, there were very few women's national football teams in Africa. The Football Association of Zambia officially organized women's football in 1983. Since then, Zambia has formed a senior national team and an under-20 team for women. The national federation continues to support women's football by allocating funds for the women's and youth games. In 2009, there were 100 teams for women aged 16 and above, and 112 teams for young women under 16. The country has established a national women's league, as well as regional and school competitions. Women's football in Africa as a whole faces challenges, such as limited access to education, poverty among women, and deep-rooted inequality leading to occasional human rights abuses against women. When talented football players emerge in Africa, they often leave their home country to seek better opportunities elsewhere, which affects the local game negatively. Funding is also an issue for women's football in Africa, with most of the financial support coming from FIFA rather than the local national football associations. The Zambia women's national football team has received sponsorship for their kits. In 2003, Umbro, the sportswear brand, sponsored the national team as part of a sponsorship deal with the Zambia national football team. The official kit colours for the team consist of green shorts, a green jersey, and green socks. The team has been featured in media outlets such as the Zambia Daily Mail, Times of Zambia, and the Post Newspapers. These publications have included pictures of players and conducted interviews with them. == Tournaments == === Homeless World Cup === Zambia's national team took part in the Homeless World Cup in 2008. They played against several countries and won all their games, becoming the champions. The tournament took place in Melbourne, Australia. They had victories against Paraguay with a score of 6-1, Uganda 6-1, Kyrgyzstan 5-4, Liberia 4-1, Cameroon 17-0, Australia 18-1, and Colombia 10-1. In the semifinals, they won against Kyrgyzstan with a score of 10-0. In the final, they defeated Liberia with a score of 7-1. The team was led by the Twins Coach and Manager James Chibuye and John Chibuye. The tournament was played with five players on each side, and the team consisted of eight players: Christine Kabemba, Grace Mwango, Melinda Namafe, Carol Kanyemba, Ednasha Mambwe, Jessica Chabota, Ireen Chanda, and Sarah Daka. === Olympic Team === In the 2012 Summer Olympics, there were no age restrictions for players. However, Zambia chose to qualify with a team of players under the age of 20 or 23. They participated in the qualifying tournament with the goal of representing the country at the Olympics. The qualification tournament started in 2010 and the team was coached by Enala Phiri-Simbeye. During their campaign, they had a 4-1 victory against the Botswana women's national football team in Gaborone and won again with a score of 2-1 in Lusaka. The team's impressive performance earned praise from women's groups in Zambia. In January 2011, Zambia faced South Africa in the qualifying tournament. The squad selected to play against South Africa included goalkeepers Mirriam Katamanda and Ennie Matukuta, defenders Meya Banda, Verocia Chiluba, Jessica Chabota, Mulai Wilombe, Deborah Chisenga, and Veronica Chisala, midfielders Misozi Zulu, Susan Banda, Etas Banda, Fostina Sakala, Kabange Mupopo, Rachel Chisha, and Chisala Musonda, and strikers Mwila Bowa, Noria Sosala, Gift Lisaka, and Ednasha Mambwe. Chiluba, the second daughter of Zambia's president, was also part of the team. Under the guidance of Enala Simbeya, Zambia's U23 team took part in the qualifiers for the 2011 All-Africa Games. They played two matches against Zimbabwe. In the first game held at Rufaro Stadium in Harare on Sunday, 13 February 2011, Zimbabwe won 1-0 against Zambia, despite a goalless first half. In the return leg on Sunday, 27 February 2011, played at Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka, Zambia lost 1-3 to Zimbabwe, with Zambia scoring a goal in the second half after being down 0-3 in the first half. Simbeya named her team of 18 players just a day before the game. Unfortunately, the loss resulted in Zambia's elimination, while Zimbabwe advanced to play against Angola. === FIFA Women's World Cup === Year Round Matches Wins Draws Losses GF GA 1991 did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter 1995 did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify 1999 did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter 2003 did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify 2007 did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify 2011 did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter did not enter 2015 did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify 2019 did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify did not qualify 2023 Group stage 3 1 0 2 3 11 Total 3 1 0 2 3 11 == References == Category:Football in Zambia Category:National sports teams of Zambia Category:African women's national association football teams",
