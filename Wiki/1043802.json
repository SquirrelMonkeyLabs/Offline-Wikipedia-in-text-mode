 "text": "Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory (CHC) is a science model that tells about how intelligence works. It was made by three psychologists. These psychologists are Raymond B. Cattell, John L. Horn and John B. Carroll. They used factor analysis to discover it. CHC theory says that there are relationships or levels of cognitive abilities. g, or \"general intelligence,\" is the most stable of any level. It predicts the best. Next, there are \"broad abilities.\" These are things like how much knowledge you have, or your ability to reason. Both g and these broad abilities are measured by individual tests.Flanagan, D.
