 "text": "Philautus gunungensis is a frog. It lives in Malaysia. People have seen it near Mount Kinabalu. People have seen it between 1400 and 1500 meters above sea level. This frog is not in danger of dying out because, even though it only lives in one small place (22 square kilometers), that place is a protected park: Kinabalu National Park. Scientists have seen this frog's eggs and young inside the water in pitcher plants. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
