 "text": "The Burmese cat is a breed of cat. Burmese are divided into two groups, British Burmese and American Burmese. Life expectancy of Burmese can reach 16-18 years. == History == In the early 1930s, Dr. Joseph Thompson of San Francisco imported a dark brown female cat from Burma named Wong Mau. At that time in the United States, there was no cat breed similar to Wong Mau. Eventually, Wong Mau was crossed with Siamese. Subsequently, new breed kittens were born that had characteristics like Siamese. This crossbreed type was later developed as the Tonkinese. == Appearance == Burmese is medium-bodied, heavy and muscular cat, weighing around 4-6 kg. The Burmese has a round, curved head and medium-sized, wide, pointed ears. The eyes are round and wide, with a golden yellow eye color. The tail is straight and of medium length. The coat is short, soft and glossy. == Behavior == Burmese are less aggressive, kind, friendly and adaptable cats. Burmese are also easy to train, and can live with other pets. Burmese have a voice similar to Siamese, but Burmese are softer and sweeter. Burmese always want to get carried away with human activities. Burmese are not happy if left alone in the house for long periods of time. According to CFA research, Burmese that are often left in the house alone will become disobedient to their owners. == References == == Other websites == * 4th printing *National Alliance of Burmese Breeders, a CFA- affiliated Burmese Club *Burmese pedigree database *Burmese-Burmilla pedigree database *New Zealand Burmese Cat Club *UK Burmese Cat Association *The Burmese Cat Club *Burmese Brown Cat Breeds Characteristics and more also read about another brown cat breed York Chocolate *UK Burmese Cat Society *United Burmese Cat Fanciers (UBCF) a non-affiliated global Burmese Cat Club Category:Cat breeds",
