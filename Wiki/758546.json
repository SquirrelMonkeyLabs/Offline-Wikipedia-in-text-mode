 "text": "Fernand Robichaud (born December 2, 1939) is a Canadian politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada and a Senator in the Senate of Canada. When he was in the House of Commons, he represented the electoral area of Beauséjour. When he was in the Senate, he represented Saint- Louis-de-Kent, New Brunswick. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. Robichaud is most well known for helping the leader of the Liberal Party, Jean Chrétien, in 1990. After Chrétien became leader of the party, he was not yet a member of the House of Commons. Usually, party leaders run in by-elections to get into the House of Commons, and represent the electoral area for a short time. Robichaud resigned as an MP so that Chrétien could win a by-election. When there was an election in 1993, Chrétien moved back to representing an area in Quebec and let Robichaud run for election in Beauséjour again. Chrétien later recommended that Robichaud should become a member of the Senate. He officially joined the Senate on September 22, 1997. He stopped being a member of the Senate when he became 75 years old, on December 2, 2014. This is because in Canada's Senate, you cannot be over 75 years old to be a member. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Privy Councillors (Canada) Category:Politicians from New Brunswick Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada",
