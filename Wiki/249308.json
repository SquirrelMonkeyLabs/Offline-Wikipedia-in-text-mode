 "text": "The subject in grammar is the agent (the 'doer') in an active sentence such as: Alan kissed Jane. However, there is a difficulty. The following two sentences are identical in meaning: *Our children planted a tree. *A tree was planted by our children. Only in the first sentence is our children the grammatical subject. So there is a difference between the logical subject and the grammatical subject.McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. The Oxford companion to the English language. Oxford University Press.p996 Also, many sentences have no subject, for instance: *Come here! *Identifying the thief may take some time. If a sentence does have a subject, then the rest of the sentence may be called the predicate. == References == Category:Grammar",
