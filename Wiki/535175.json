Nocturnal forest birds and arboreal marsupials of the southwestern slopes, New South Wales. Australian Zoologist 30, 449-466 In North Queensland, the sub-species lives at over 700 m above sea level.http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/66668-conservation- advice.pdf There are 13 different populations in three places where this glider lives in North Queensland. One population lives on Mount Windsor Tableland, another on Mount Carbine Tableland, and the third lives in a linear habitat from Atherton to Kirrama on the Atherton Tableland. These three populations together have about 6000 individual gliders. With their habitat in danger, the yellow-bellied glider is classified as uncommon to rare and is named vulnerable to the tropics. This species is more widespread in southern Queensland, NSW and Victoria. The yellow-bellied glider is gregarious and spends the day in a leaf-lined tree hole, which is usually shared with other members of the same family. It is also one of the most vocal possum gliders. It has a distinctive growling call that it uses as means of communication. A recording of the distinctive call can be heard at It eats nectar, honeydew, insects, pollen and a wide spread of tree sap. == References == Category:Marsupials of Australia Category:Diprotodonts",
