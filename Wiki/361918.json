 "text": "Highmark Stadium is a large stadium in Orchard Park, New York. It is the home of the Buffalo Bills team. The stadium has had several names during its history. It opened in 1973 as Rich Stadium, after the food products company of that name. After the sponsorship contract ran out in 1998, it was renamed Ralph Wilson Stadium in honor of Ralph Wilson (1918-2014), the team's founding owner from 1960 until his death in 2014. A new sponsorship contract with locally based headwear company New Era in 2016 led to a new name of New Era Field. In July 2020, New Era asked to be released from its contract, and the stadium became Bills Stadium for the 2020 NFL season. The current name took effect in March 2021, after regional health insurance company Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield signed a 10-year naming deal. On June 5, 2023, construction started on a new stadium. The new stadium will be the new home of the Buffalo Bills and will replace Highmark Stadium. The new stadium will also have naming rights by Highmark. ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:Sports buildings in New York (state) Category:National Football League venues Category:Buffalo Bills",
