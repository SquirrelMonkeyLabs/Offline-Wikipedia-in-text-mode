 "text": "The word dissolve can mean: * In chemistry, it is the act of solvation, when a solid is mixed into a liquid, creating a solution. Mixing salt into water is an example. Upon evaporation, the dissolved parts usually come out of solution and reform the solid. * In film and video editing, it is one way of changing the view. For example, a scene fades (changes slowly) from a bright day to all black. * In politics or law dissolution means that something is brought to an end, either permanently or so that a new election can happen.",
