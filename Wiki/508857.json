 "text": "Aglaophyton is a genus of early Devonian fossil land plants. Its fossils have been found in the Rhynie chert. Only the sporophyte generation have been found as fossils. Only one species has been found, Aglaophyton major. ==Relationship to other plants== Aglaophyton was at first thought to be a species of the vascular plant genus Rhynia which lived at the same time. Later it was discovered that it is not really a vascular plant. It had vascular tissue, but the cells had thin walls. It might therefore be a missing link between the Bryophytes and Horneophyton and the vascular plants like Rhynia. In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram which has Aglaophyton as the sister group of the vascular plants. ==References== ==Other websites== * Cladogram from Category:Fossil plants Category:Extinct plants",
