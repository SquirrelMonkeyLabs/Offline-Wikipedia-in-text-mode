 "text": "Abortion funds are groups that help people who can't afford an abortion. They give money to help pay for the procedure. They may also help with things like transportation, child care, or finding a clinic. == How abortion funds work == Abortion funds decide how much to help based on what each person can pay. People are asked to pay what they can. The fund covers the rest. They don't usually pay the full cost. Sometimes they work with other funds to help more. Some funds work with specific clinics. Others help in certain cities or regions. In addition to paying for abortions, they might help with other needs like getting to the clinic or taking care of children during the procedure. Most abortion funds get their money from local donations. In some cases, governments have given money to help. For example, in 2019, New York City gave $250,000 to a fund for patients traveling to New York for abortions. == Where abortion funds help == Abortion funds exist in many places. In the United States, groups like the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF) and the National Abortion Federation (NAF) help people find support. Other groups, like the Abortion Support Network in Europe and the MARIA Abortion Fund in Mexico, help people in other countries. == Problems abortion funds face == In the United States, there are rules that make it hard for abortion funds to help. For example, the Hyde amendment stops federal Medicaid money from being used for most abortions. Many states also don't allow Medicaid or private insurance to pay for abortions. Around the world, a United States rule called the Mexico City Policy blocks American foreign aid from going to groups that provide or talk about abortion. Other organizations, like the Safe Abortion Action Fund, help groups affected by this rule. == How much an abortion costs == The cost of an abortion depends on how far along a pregnancy is and the type of procedure. A first-trimester abortion usually costs around $500. Later abortions can cost much more. Other expenses, like travel or child care, can add to the cost. Most people who need abortions in the United States have to pay out of pocket because their insurance doesn't cover it. These high costs can cause delays, making abortions more expensive and harder to get. == References == Category:Abortion Category:Finance",
