 "text": "Haunting the Chapel is an extended play (EP) made by Slayer. Slayer is an American thrash metal band. Metal Blade Records, a record label, released it in June 1984. Slayer's first album, Show No Mercy, was Metal Blade's best selling album. Because of this, the owner of Metal Blade wanted the band to make an EP. The band recorded the EP in Hollywood. Dave Lombardo met Gene Hoglan while the band was making the album. Lombardo changed how he played the drums after meeting Hoglan. While recording the EP, Lombardo started using two bass drums in his drum kit. Hoglan helped Lombardo play the bass drums better. The EP has three songs on it. These are \"Chemical Warfare\", \"Captor of Sin\" and \"Haunting the Chapel\". The band played \"Chemical Warfare\" at many of their concerts. Haunting the Chapel did not go on any music charts. Other music makers have said they were inspired by the EP. Chuck Schuldiner of Death said that Haunting the Chapel was \"life changing\". Bolt Thrower and At the Gates have also been inspired by it. == Track listing == == References == Category:1984 albums Category:Slayer albums",
