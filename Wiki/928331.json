 "text": "The Dakota Apartments is a Chateauesque style cooperative apartment building in Manhattan, New York City. The name of the building Dakota comes from the fact that Manhattan was sparsely populated at the time of the building's construction, just like South Dakota and North Dakota. The 10-storey building has 94 units, no two of which are the same. Dakota Apartments is one of the hardest co-op buildings to buy into and the co-op board has rejected the residency applications of celebrities like Madonna and Billy Joel. John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono are the most famous residents of the Dakota. Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan",
