It protects all the property owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and it enforces state and city laws. The PAPD is one of the largest police departments in the United States, with over 2000 members. The PAPD is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a two-state agency that runs the bridges, tunnels, airports, and seaports along the New York - New Jersey border. ==Terrorist attacks== The Port Authority's World Trade Center was the target of a terrorist attack on February 26, 1993, and of the more successful September 11 attacks in 2001. The area had over 50,000 employees and 70,000 visitors per day; the work of emergency personnel including the Port Authority Police, the New York City Police Department, the New York City Fire Department, New York City EMS, New York State Court Officers, Federal Agents and many others helped to lower the deaths from the attack.
