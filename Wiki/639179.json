Interstate 74 and Illinois Route 47 meet in the town. Mahomet has three ZIP codes: 61853, 61840, and 61875. ==History== Before the first European settlers came, the area around the Sangamon River that became Mahomet was inhabited by Kickapoo and Pottawattami Indians. In 1836, Daniel T. Porter laid out a village plan. That is where Mahomet is now. Mahomet was first called Middletown. This was presumably because it is half- way point between Bloomington and Danville. But there was another Middletown in Illinois. Therefore, in the mid-19th century, the name was changed. == Demographics== Population in 2021: 9,589 Males: (48.0%) Females: (52.0%)https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/mahometvillageillinois/PST045221 == References== Category:Towns in Illinois",
