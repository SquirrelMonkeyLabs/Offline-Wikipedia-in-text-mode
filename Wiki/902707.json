 "text": "The Exchange 106 is a skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 95-floor building is tall. The Exchange 106 is currently the 21st tallest building in the world and the third-tallest building in Malaysia. The tower, along with Merdeka 118 with the 678.9 meters-high , have been controversial and were called a \"national disgrace\" because of a project scandal that led to their creation. As of December 2021, the overall building of TRX is mostly done with the mall section being under construction until late 2022. ==References== Category:Skyscrapers in Malaysia Category:Buildings and structures in Kuala Lumpur",
