 "text": "Nagarjuna was a Buddhist monk and philosopher in the Mahayana tradition, known for the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism. He is highly regarded as one of the most important Buddhist philosophers, and credited as the founder of Madhyamaka philosophy. His key work is the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (Root Verses on Madhyamaka), and is a important text explaining the philosophy of emptiness in Madhyamaka. Jan Westerhoff considers Nagarjuna to be among the greatest thinkers in the history of Asian philosophy. == Early life == We have limited reliable information about Nagarjuna's life, and historians disagree on when and where he lived (possibly 1st to 3rd century CE in various places).Walser (2005), p. 60. The earliest surviving accounts were written in Chinese and Tibetan centuries after his death and are mostly hagiographical accounts that are historically unverifiable. The earliest accounts were written centuries later in Chinese and Tibetan, mainly offering hagiographical, unverifiable details. Some scholars, like Joseph Walser, suggest Nagarjuna served as an advisor to a king of the Satavahana dynasty in the 2nd century, possibly Yajna Sri Satakarni, based on archaeological findings at Amaravati. This places Nagarjuna around 150–250 CE.Walser (2005), p. 61. == References == == Other websites == * * Online version of the Ratnāvalī (Precious Garland) in English Translated by Prof. Vidyakaraprabha and Bel-dzek * Online version of the Suhṛllekha (Letter to a Friend) in English Translated by Alexander Berzin * * * Nārāgjuna vis-à-vis the Āgama-s and Nikāya-s Byoma Kusuma Nepalese Dharmasangha (archived) * ZenEssays: Nagarjuna and the Madhyamika * Mula madhyamaka karika online Tibetan and English version translated by Stephen Batchelor (archived) Category:Buddhism Category:Bodhisattvas Category:Monks",
