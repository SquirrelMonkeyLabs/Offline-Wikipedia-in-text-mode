 "text": "Jakku is a desert planet from Star Wars. The planet first appeared in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the first installment in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Jakku is very sparsely populated because of its harsh climate. After the Battle of Endor, Jakku was the sight of a big battle between the remaining Imperial fleet and the newly formed New Republic fleet. As soldiers fought each other in the desert and dogfights took place above, the large cruisers from the fleets started to drag each other to the surface of the planet with their tractor beams. Ships crashed to surface causing a \"graveyard\" of ships to form. The Republic fleet won the battle and the remaining Imperial forces fled into the unknown regions of the galaxy. Rey Skywalker is from Jakku and helped Finn escape the planet with BB-8 after the First Order massacred a village and started to look for Finn, after he deserted. A year later the people of Jakku rose up against the First Order as part of a galaxy wide rebellion after the Battle of Exegol in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. ==References== Category:Star Wars planets",
