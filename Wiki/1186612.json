Therefore, he sent the Mughal imperial army under Mirza Shafi Khan who was the grandnephew of the Mirza. Shafi started his campaign in January 1780. ==Battle== A Marathi letter stated that \" From Delhi Najaf Khan has sent his assistant Ambar Shah (Shafi) with 40,000 troops and artillery against the Sikhs. He went to Sirhind district and confronted the Sikhs.; The Sikhs defeated the imperial army, slew ten to fifteen thousand soldiers and seized all their guns. The imperial army fled back to Panipat.\" ==Aftermath== The entire campaign ended in June 1781 as an expensive loss after failing to stop the Sikhs. == Related pages == * Nihang ==References== ==Bibliography== *",
