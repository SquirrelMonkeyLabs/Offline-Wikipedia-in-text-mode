 "text": "The Tuileries Palace () was a royal and imperial palace in Paris, France, located on the right bank of the Seine River, adjacent to the Louvre Museum. It was built in 1564 by Catherine de' Medici and was the main residence of many French monarchs until it was burned down during the Paris Commune in 1871. The palace's ruins were demolished in 1883. == History == The Tuileries Palace was commissioned in 1564 by Queen Catherine de' Medici, widow of King Henry II of France. The palace took its name from the tile factories (tuileries) that previously occupied the site. Catherine’s intention was to escape from the Louvre, which she associated with the tragic death of her husband. Designed by architect Philibert de l'Orme in a French Renaissance style, the palace began as a modest structure but was greatly expanded over the centuries by subsequent rulers, including Henry IV of France, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, and Napoleon Bonaparte. During the reign of Louis XIV, the Sun King shifted the royal residence to Versailles Palace, and the Tuileries was used less frequently. However, in the 19th century, it became a key seat of political power under the Bourbon Restoration, the July Monarchy, and the Second Empire. === French Revolution and Napoleonic Era === The palace played a central role in the French Revolution. After the storming of the Bastille in 1789, King Louis XVI and his family were forcibly moved from Versailles to the Tuileries, where they were held under virtual house arrest. In 1792, revolutionaries stormed the palace, leading to the imprisonment of the royal family and the eventual execution of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. During the Napoleonic era, the palace was extensively renovated. Napoleon Bonaparte made the Tuileries his official residence and transformed it into a symbol of imperial grandeur. The palace became the center of political and court life during the First French Empire. === Destruction during the Paris Commune === In 1871, during the uprising of the Paris Commune, the Tuileries Palace was set ablaze by Communard forces to prevent it from being used by government troops. The fire destroyed much of the palace, leaving only a shell. Despite efforts by some to restore it, the French government decided to demolish the ruins in 1883. == Architecture == The Tuileries Palace was built in phases, starting with its Renaissance foundations under Catherine de' Medici, followed by expansions in the Baroque and Neoclassical styles. The initial design by Philibert de l'Orme was later augmented by leading architects, including Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart. The palace was characterized by a long, rectangular layout with a series of pavilions and courtyards. Its north façade faced the Tuileries Garden, which was designed by André Le Nôtre, while the southern side looked toward the Seine. Notable features included the Pavillon de Flore and Pavillon de Marsan, which still exist today and form part of the Louvre complex. == Legacy and current site == Though the palace was destroyed, its legacy lives on through the Tuileries Garden, which remains one of the most visited public parks in Paris. The space where the palace once stood is now an open area within the Louvre’s extended complex. Efforts to rebuild the Tuileries have been proposed multiple times, but none have succeeded. The memory of the palace continues to evoke the grandeur of French royalty and the tumultuous history of the French Revolution and the Paris Commune. == Notable residents == * Catherine de' Medici * Henry IV of France * Louis XIII of France * Louis XIV of France * Napoleon Bonaparte * Napoleon III of France == Related pages == * Tuileries Garden * Louvre Museum * French Revolution * Paris Commune == References == * * Category:Palaces in France Category:French Revolution Category:Buildings and structures in Paris",
