Free Voters usually only run in the local elections. The group attracts conservative voters who prefer local decisions in politics. In the 2014 European Parliament elections, the Free Voters won a seat in the European Parliament. Ulrike Müller is currently the only Free Voter MEP in the European Parliament. The Free Voters association joined the European Democratic Party (which is a centrist and pro-European Union political party in the European Parliament) in October 2015. == References == == Other websites == *Official website of the Bavarian FW Category:Political organizations based in Europe Category:Organisations based in Germany",
