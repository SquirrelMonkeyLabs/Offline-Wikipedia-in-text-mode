 "text": "Mute R. Kelly (also styled as #MuteRKelly) is an American movement. It wants contemporary R&B;, soul and gospel singer and recording artist R. Kelly convicted (meaning found guilty) of sexual abuse, child pornography, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. The movement also wants Kelly to stop receiving money with his singing career. ==Founding== The movement was founded by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye in 2017. The latter said: \"#MuteRKelly continues until the Black community has fully financially divested from the man and his music and we tackle the overwhelming issue of sexual abuse\". Odeleye was an African American Arts Administrator from Atlanta, Georgia. Barnes is a lobbyist and activist. She also sought to lobby elected officials. She wanted to mobilize activists around the world to encourage users of music streaming platforms to #ThumbItDown, when R. Kelly's music plays. This was in order to change the algorithm of his songs until they are no longer playing. ==Accusations== During a period of two to three decades, Kelly was accused of sexual abuse of children and adolescents. One example was getting married to then fifteen-year-old R&B; and pop singer Aaliyah on August 31, 1994 in Cook County, Illinois. The marriage was dissolved just over five months later at orders from from Aaliyah's family. Aaliyah later admitted she had lied to people about her age. She was really fifteen-years-old when she and Kelly married each other. ==Related pages== * Me Too movement * Harvey Weinstein * Sexual harassment ==References== Category:Sexual abuse Category:Feminism Category:Controversies Category:Companies based in Atlanta Category:2017 establishments in the United States Category:Social movements",
