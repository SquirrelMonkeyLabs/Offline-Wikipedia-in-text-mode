She grew up on a council estate just outside Belfast and moved to Manchester from Northern Ireland in 2003. She told the BBC: \"I grew up in social housing and my family still rely on it. I know the value of [what] the safety net of a good quality home can give you when times are tough.\" and that she wanted \"to reach a point where me being a woman and being gay is entirely uninteresting and unremarkable\". She graduated from Manchester University in 2007 with a degree in politics and modern history and later gaining a postgraduate in Local Government Management from Warwick Business School and a MA in public policy and governance from Manchester University, both while she had a full time job.
