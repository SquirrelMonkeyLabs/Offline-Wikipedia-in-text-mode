In 1402 their fortifications at Ä°zmir fell to the Mongols under Tamerlane.David Nicolle, Knight Hospitaller (Oxford: Osprey Military, 2001): 1306-1565 (), p. 53 Threatened by an invasion of the Seljuks they built the castle at Bodrum. Its location was the site of a fortification during the Doric Greek period. There was also a small Seljuk castle in the 11th century. The same promontory is also the probable site of the palace of Mausolos.Trevor Bryce, The Routledge Handbook of the Peoples and Places of Ancient Western Asia (Oxford; New York: Routledge, 2009), p. 278 He was the king of Caria. The construction of the castle began in 1404. It was fully fortified by 1460.Archaeology and Architecture of the Military Orders: New Studies, eds. Christer Carlsson; Mathias Piana (Farnham, Surrey; Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2014), p. 59 Bodrum came under its final siege in 1522. At the time it was still strong enough to send men to Rhodes. After Rhodes fell, the castle surrendered. == Museum of Underwater Archaeology == The Museum of Underwater Archaeology is housed inside the castle.Samantha Lafferty, Turkey's Aegean Coast: Ismir, Ephesus, Bodrum, Pergamon, Kusadasi & Beyond (Edison, NJ: Hunter Publishing, 2008), p. 280 One of its displays is one of the world's oldest ships believed to come from the 6th century.
