 "text": "Mughal-Persian war of 1638 is a conflict which took place in 1638, A conflict between Safavid Empire of Persia and Mughal Empire of Hindustan which took place over a city in present day Afghanistan named Kandahar The war resulted in a victory for the Mughals when Ali mardan Khan surrendered the keys of Kandahar to the Mughals. ==Backround== Mughals had previously lost the City of Kandahar to the Safavids. It was considered important for the Mughal Empire that the twin gateway-cities to Hindustan, i.e. Kabul and Kandahar, be brought under Mughal rule. Central Asian trade provided the Mughals with warhorses, without which not only the military forces would be incapacitated, but could also potentially spark tribal revolts and foreign invasions.Kinra 2015, p.157 Kandahar in particular was at the crossroads of a number of major commercial trade routes in Central Asia. The two cities were thus the subject of deep strategic concern. ==War== In 1639, the armies of Shah Safi of Persia captured Bamyan and it appeared that they would attack Kandahar next. In 1646, Shah Jahan, with Kamran Khanand Malik Maghdood, had marched on Kandahar and asked the surrender from the Persian commander, Ali Mardan Khan. He expected the Persians to attempt to regain the city soon and so he ordered that the wall be repaired rapidly while a large Hindustani army based in Kabul protected the area. In 1646, when no Persian attack came, the Emperor sent his son, Murad Baksh, to invade Uzbek-controlled Badakhshan. In the following year, Aurangzeb, another son, routed an Uzbek force outside of Balkh and captured the city, Kandahar was captured by the Hindustanis in 1638 too.Chandra 2005, p. 226 ==Surrender of Ali Mardan== Ali Mardan khan, Soon surrendered the city of Kandahar to the Mughal garrison, This resulted in the Reconquest of Kandahar by the MughalsThis betrayal of Ali mardan khan enabled the Mughals to re-take Kandahar until the next siege of Kandahar in 1649 which would be led by the Safavid army. == References == Category:Pages created with the Article Wizard from 2024 Category:16th-century conflicts Category:Mughal Empire Category:Kandahar Province",
