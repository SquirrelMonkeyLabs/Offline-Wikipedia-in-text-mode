 "text": "S.S. Lazio is an Italian football club based in Formello (Via di Santa Cornelia 1000, Rome) in Serie A. They play in light blue shirts, white shorts and socks. The name Lazio was chosen as the original founders wanted to name the club after something which was greater and encompassed more than just the city that they were from - Lazio is the name of the region where Rome is. The sky blue and white team colors were inspired by the Greek flag and more specifically the country which gave birth to Olympic tradition; the eagle as an acknowledgement by its founders. == League title == * Serie A : 2 ** 1973/74, 1999/00 * Serie B : 1 ** 1968/69 * Coppa Italia : 7 ** 1958, 1998, 2000, 2004, 2009, 2013, 2019 * Supercoppa Italiana : 5 ** 1998, 2000, 2009, 2017, 2019 * Cup Winners' Cup : 1 ** 1999 * UEFA Super Cup : 1 ** 1999 * Coppa delle Alpi : 1 ** 1971 == League position == Season League Position 2000/01 Serie A 3rd 2001/02 Serie A 6th 2002/03 Serie A 4th 2003/04 Serie A 6th 2004/05 Serie A 13th 2005/06 Serie A 16th 2006/07 Serie A 3rd 2007/08 Serie A 12th 2008/09 Serie A 10th 2009/10 Serie A 12th 2010/11 Serie A 5th === Former position === == Other websites == * SS Lazio * Serie A Category:Italian football clubs Category:Organizations based in Rome Category:1900 establishments in Italy",
