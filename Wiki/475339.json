 "text": "A field of study – also called a discipline – is a general area of knowledge, learning, or research. In schools they are often called \"subjects\". Some examples include biology, mathematics, and classical studies. Disciplines require training and qualification. Qualified people are able to use the methods of a discipline, and have knowledge of that discipline. Thus, for example, a chemist knows chemistry, and can carry out chemical analysis in a standard chemical laboratory. The discipline of palaeography, the study of ancient writing, covers knowledge of older forms of writing, and how to study, decipher and translate examples of early writing. ==Further reading== * A.
