 "text": "The Sukhoi Superjet 100 () or SSJ100 is a regional aircraft dedicated to passenger transport, with a capacity between 68 and 103 seats. Its development began in the year 2000, designed by the Russian aeronautical company Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company. == Accidents and incidents == There have been three hull loss accidents and 86 deaths as of June 2019. * On 9 May 2012, a demonstration flight directly struck Mount Salak in Indonesia, killing all 45 on board (Sukhoi personnel and representatives of various local airlines). The TAWS was ignored by the pilot, distracted by a conversation with a potential customer. * On 21 July 2013, during autoland evaluation of an RRJ-95B (Russian experimental registry) with a single engine in a crosswind at Keflav√≠k Airport in Iceland, the fuselage hit and slid down the runway with the gear up. During an intended go-around, the fatigued pilot throttled down the wrong engine, causing the aircraft to lose thrust sufficient for controlled flight. The plane continued to lose altitude and hit the runway even as the pilot realized his mistake and throttled up the engine. One of the five crew was injured during evacuation. The Icelandic Aircraft Accident Investigation Board investigated the event and issued nine recommendations. * On 10 October 2018, a Yakutia Airlines SSJ100 slid off the runway at Yakutsk Airport as the main landing gear collapsed. All 87 passengers and five crew were safely evacuated and none were seriously injured. The excursion may have been caused by ice on the runway or the airstrip's poor state of repair. The airliner was damaged beyond repair and was expected to be written off. * On 5 May 2019, as Aeroflot Flight 1492 was climbing after takeoff from Moscow Sheremetyevo, at lightning discharged close to the aircraft from a nearby cumulonimbus cloud with a base. The radio and other equipment failed, and the flight crew chose to make an emergency landing at Sheremetyevo. The aircraft bounced several times after an initial touchdown, and after the fourth hard touchdown a fire erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. An emergency evacuation was then carried out but 41 out of 78 occupants died. == Gallery == File: SSJ-100_bort3_1.jpg File: SSJ-100_bort1_1.jpg File:15-07-14-Suchoj-Superjet-100-RalfR-WMA 0556.jpg File: SSJ-100_board-004_1.jpg File: SSJ-100_board-004_2.jpg File: SSJ-100_board_004.ogv == References == == Other websites == * * Unofficial production list and backlog * * Products of the Regional Aircraft-Branch of the Irkut Corporation Category:Sukhoi aircraft",
