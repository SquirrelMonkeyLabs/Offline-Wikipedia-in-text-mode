 "text": "Selena y Los Dinos was the band which Mexican-American Tejano pop singer Selena belonged to until her untimely death in 1995. == Biography == === Beginning === The band was created when Selena was nine-years old by her father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr. He immediately spread his musical talent (which he pursued himself in his earlier days) among his three children. Suzette was put on the drums. A.B. was put on the bass guitar. The family first showcased their band at their restaurant \"Papa Gayos\" (English: Parrots). Then they continued to sing at more and more different places. Within a year the family's restaurant went bankrupt and the family was forced to move in with relatives as Abraham had quit his job to manage the restaurant full-time. The band then performed wherever they could, including weddings, street corners, fairs, and quinceañeras, at some places gaining a lot of appreciation, while others not so much. The band was even \"booed\" off while performing at a wedding, followed by food being thrown on stage. === Chris Pérez === In 1988, the Quintanilla family was present at a party of the band Chris Pérez was currently in. Impressed by his talent, A.B. asked Chris to join Selena y Los Dinos. Although he accepted, his support to the band proved to be much more than anticipated. Selena and Chris quickly fell in love and married in 1992. After Selena's death, Chris formed a band called the Chris Pérez Band which he dedicated a song to the Selena called \"The Best I Can\". After the band broke up in 2002, he formed another band with Selena's brother A.B. called Kumbia All Starz. === Selena ¡VIVE! === The band members reunited for the tribute concert, in honor of Selena, on April 7, 2005. Selena ¡VIVE!, was held at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. Not only did the event sold-out, it became the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language Television special ever in the history of American television. The introduction was made by Jennifer Lopez. == Band members == * Selena - lead vocals * Chris Pérez - lead and rhythm guitars * Ricky Vela - keyboards * Joe Ojeda - keyboards * A.B.
