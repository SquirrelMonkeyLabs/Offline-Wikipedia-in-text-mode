Stone Temple Pilots' Scott Weiland was previously the lead singer. He joined the band after Stone Temple Pilots broke up in 2003. The band got success with their first album Contraband in 2004 and released their second album Libertad in 2007. Scott left the band in 2008, though he did one more one-off show with the band in 2012.
