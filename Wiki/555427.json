 "text": "Cultured meat, also called cultivated meat, is meat grown in cell culture instead of inside animals. It is a form of cellular agriculture. Cultured meat is produced using many of the same tissue engineering techniques used in regenerative medicine. Until now, the cost to produce cultured meat has been extremely high. The first cultured burger patty, created by Dr. Mark Post at Maastricht University, was eaten in August 2013, at a demonstration for the press in London. Cultured meat is believed to be something that can help solve concerns about the environment, animal welfare, food security, and human health. == References == Category:Agriculture Category:Meat",
