 "text": "Macquarie Island is a large island in the Southern Ocean. It is about south east of Tasmania, and about half way between Australia and Antarctica. The island became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Macquarie Island is about long and wide. It was first discovered in July 1810, by Captain Hasselburgh, who was searching for places to hunt whales and seals. No people live there now. The only way to get to the island is by sea and there are no harbors to dock a ship. ==Geology== The island was formed by two tectonic plates meeting and forcing each other upwards. It is the only place on Earth where rocks from the Earth's mantle, below the ocean floor, are being pushed up above sea level. Confirmation is in this reference under section \"Criterion (viii)\". ==Plants and animals== Many birds and animals use Macquarie Island to breed. About 3.5 million seabirds and 80,000 elephant seals come to the island every year. Four types of penguins live on the island. There are about 850,000 royal penguins, 200,000 king penguins, 10,000 gentoo penguins, and rockhopper penguins with numbers thought to be between 20,000 and 1,000,000. In 1977 Macquarie Island became a Biosphere Reserve. The coastal ecosystem is recognized as part of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme.World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), \"Macquarie Island\"; retrieved 2012-7-18. == Related pages == *List of World Heritage Sites in Australia ==References == ==Other websites== * * List of biosphere reserves which are wholly or partially world heritage sites Category:World Heritage Sites in Australia Category:Islands of Australia Category:Australian National Heritage List Category:Protected areas of Tasmania Category:Biosphere reserves",
