He was born on 9 January 1834 at Courtfield, Ross, Herefordshire, England, second son of the fourteen children. Five of his brothers also became priests. Herbert, the eldest, became a cardinal and archbishop of Westminster, and John, the youngest, auxiliary bishop of Salford. Another brother, Reginald, married Julia Shanahan, sister-in-law of Sir Patrick Jennings. Four of his five sisters became nuns. Because of his health he was educated at home in a religious atmosphere. In 1850 he was sent to St Gregory's College at Downside near Bath. His mother's death in 1853 made him think of a religious life and on 12 September he joined the Benedictines, becoming Brother Bede. In 1855 at his father's request and expense, he was sent to Rome for further study under the guidance of the Italian scholar and reformer, Angelo Zelli-Jacuzzi. He was ordained priest by Cardinal Patrizi in the basilica of St John Lateran on 9 April 1859.
