 "text": "A megasecond is one million seconds. This page lists times between 106 seconds and 109 seconds, which is about 11.6 days and 0.0317 years. One megasecond contains 1000 kiloseconds. There are 1000 megaseconds in one gigasecond. Ten megaseconds is equal to 115.74 days. 100 megaseconds is equal to 3.2 years. == Less than a year == *1.21×106 seconds = 14 days – a fortnight *1.38×106 seconds = 15.9735 days – half life of vanadium-48 *1.54×106 seconds = 17.81 days – half life of californium-253 *2.36×106 seconds = 27.3217 days – sidereal month *2.39×106 seconds = 27.7025 days – half life of chromium-51 *2.42×106 seconds = 28 days – length of February in non-leap years *2.51×106 seconds = 29 days – length of February in a leap year *2.59×106 seconds = 30 days – length of the months April, June, September, and November *2.68×106 seconds = 31 days – length of the months January, March, May, July, August, October, and December *4.45×106 seconds = 51.5 days – half life of mendelevium-258 *5.23×106 seconds = 60.5 days – half life of californium-254 *6.68×106 seconds = 77.27 days – half life of cobalt-56 *7.24×106 seconds = 83.79 days – half life of scandium-46 *7.54×106 seconds = 87.32 days – half life of sulfur-35 *7.60×106 seconds = 87 days 23.3 hours – one orbit of Mercury around the Sun *8.04×106 seconds = 93.1 days – half life of thulium-168 *8.68×106 seconds = 100.5 days – half life of fermium-257 *128.6 days - half life of thulium-170 *138 days - half life of polonium- 210 *224.701 days - one orbit of Venus around the sun *271.79 days - half life of cobalt-57 *280 days - normal length of a human pregnancy; about 24 million seconds *330 days - half life of vanadium-49 *333.5 days - half life of californium-248 *\\pi \\cdot 10^7 s \\- The value of pi times 107 seconds is sometimes given as an approximate year value; it works out to 363.61026 days. == More than a year == *365 days - a regular year in many solar calendars; about 31.53 million seconds *365.2425 days - the normal length of a year in the Gregorian calendar *365.25 days - the normal length of a year in the Julian calendar *366 days - a leap year in many solar calendars; 31.62 million seconds *373.59 days - half-life of ruthenium-106 *396.1 days - half-life of neptunium-235 *462.6 days - half-life of cadmium-109 *1.88 years - one orbit of Mars *1.92 years - half life of thulium-171 * 3.3 years -- half life of rhodium-101 * 4 years—full term of the President of the United States * 4.37 years—the amount of time it takes for light from Alpha Centauri to reach Earth * 5.2714 years—half life of cobalt-60 * 6 years—full term of a Senator in the United States * 10 years—one decade = 3.16 × 108 seconds * 11 years -- sunspot activity cycle (7.5 to 11 years) * 11.87 years—one orbit of Jupiter around the sun * 12.27 years—the amount of time Nazi Germany existed * 13 years—the normal time is takes to complete K-12 education in the United States. * 13.08 years—half life of californium-250 * 16.13 years—half life of niobium meta state Nb-93m * 18.03 years -- Saros cycle, the period of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses * 29 years—the longest a dog has ever been known to live * 29.1 years—half life of curium-243 * 29.458 years—one orbit of Saturn around the sun *35 years (1.10 × 109 s) – The youngest a person can be and become the President of the United States *36 years (1.14 × 109 s) – the longest a cat has ever been known to live *63 years (1.99 × 109 s) – half-life of titanium-44 *65 years (2.05 × 109 s) – a normal age for retirement *68.9 years (2.17 × 109 s) – half-life of uranium-232 *74 years (2.34 × 109 s) – the amount of time communists controlled the Soviet Union *75 years (2.37 × 109 s) – average life span of humans in the First World *84.3 years (2.66 × 109 s) – one orbit of Uranus around the sun *100 years (3.16 × 109 s) – one century *100.1 years (3.16 × 109 s) – half-life of nickel-63 *165 years (5.21 × 109 s) – one orbit of Neptune *190 years (6 × 109 s) – age of the oldest known tortoise *247.7 years (7.82 × 109 s) – one orbit of Pluto around the sun *269 years (8.49 × 109 s) – half-life of argon-39 *310 years (9.8 × 109 s) – one orbit of Makemake around the sun Category:Orders of magnitude Category:Units of time",
