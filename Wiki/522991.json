She is best known for the 2001 cover of the famous R&B; song \"Lady Marmalade\". ==Early life and career beginnings== Mýa is a native of Washington, D.C. She is one of three children. Her father, Sherman, was an African-American musician and singer. He played in several bands near where they lived. Her Italian-American mother, Theresa, worked as an accountant. As a child, Mýa would pretend she was Michael Jackson and would sing into a wooden spoon and pretended it was a microphone. Mýa sometimes was bullied because of her ethnic background. She would say > There was a time in my life when I wasn't popular and accepted by kids in > school. I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a > multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, > but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in > activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your > personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and > the name designer brands you have on. ==Discography== * Mýa (1998) * Fear of Flying (2000) * Moodring (2003) * Liberation (2007) * Sugar & Spice (2008) * K.I.S.S.
