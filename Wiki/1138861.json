 "text": "The vaginal venous plexus refers to the gathering of veins that drain blood from the vagina. These veins are located around the sides of the vagina. A portion of these veins eventually merges into the internal iliac veins. The vaginal venous plexus also anastomoses with the uterine, vesical, and rectal venous plexuses. There is a vaginal vein on each side that drains the blood, which then goes into the internal iliac veins. This plexus helps make the vagina rich in blood vessels. == References == Category:Cardiovascular system",
