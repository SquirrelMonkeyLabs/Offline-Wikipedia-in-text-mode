 "text": "The Steppe buzzard (Buteo buteo vulpinus) is a bird of prey, very widespread in the Old World. It lives in mostly of most of Central Asia, and other Turanian regions. It breeds as far as the northern Caucacus, northern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, much of Russia to Altai and south-central Siberia, Tien Shan in China and western Mongolia. B. b. vulpinus is a long-distance migrant. It winters largely in much of eastern and southern Africa. Less frequently and often very discontinuously, steppe buzzards winter in the southern peninsulas of Europe, Arabia and southwestern India in addition to some parts of southeastern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.Ferguson-Lees, J., & Christie, D. A. (2001). Raptors of the world.
