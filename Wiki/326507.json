 "text": "Choctaw Stadium (known until August 2021 as Globe Life Park in Arlington) is a stadium in Arlington, Texas. From its opening in 1994 until 2019, it was a baseball park that was home to the Major League Baseball team called the Texas Rangers. The ballpark replaced the old home of the Rangers, Arlington Stadium. It closed as a baseball park in October 2019 after the Rangers moved across the street to a retractable-roof stadium, Globe Life Field. After the Rangers moved out, the stadium was rebuilt for football and soccer, and soon gained new tenants in both sports. In football, the Dallas Renegades, a team in the revival of the XFL (now called the UFL), started playing there when the league started in February 2020. In soccer, North Texas SC, a team that plays in the third level of U.S. soccer, originally USL League One and now MLS Next Pro, started playing at Globe Life Park in March 2020. The latter team, the reserve team of Major League Soccer's FC Dallas, had played its first season of 2019 at FC Dallas' home of Toyota Stadium in another Dallasâ€“Fort Worth suburb, Frisco. In 2022, the Dallas Jackals, a new team in Major League Rugby, began using Choctaw Stadium as their home field. The stadium also hosts local high school football games. In August 2021, the stadium received its current name via a sponsorship contract with Choctaw Casinos & Resorts, a Native American casino company. ==References== == Sources == *Green Cathedrals, by Philip J.
