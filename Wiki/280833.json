 "text": "As a Commonwealth realm, St Kitts and Nevis has the same monarch as several other Commonwealth countries, King Charles III. In St Kitts, or when representing St Kitts in another country, he is known as the King of St Kitts and Nevis, His full official title being: Charles the Third, by the Grace of God, Kingof Saint Christopher and Nevis and of His other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth. When acting as King of St Kitts, Charles III only takes advice from the Government of St Kitts and Nevis. This is because the Statute of Westminster of 1931 said that all Commonwealth countries were independent of each other, and that the British government no longer had the right to interfere or give orders to the other countries. Usually the King's constitutional roles are carried out by the Governor- General of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Royal succession (who is next in line to the throne) is governed by the English Act of Settlement of 1701, which is part of constitutional law. ==References== Category:Saint Kitts and Nevis Category:Current monarchies",
