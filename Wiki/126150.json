 "text": "The Oval Office is the official office of the president of the United States since the West Wing was incorporated to the White House in 1909. The office was first used by President Taft and has since been used by every president ever since. Almost every President of the United States redecorates the furnishings of the Oval Office, but usually, at the start of their administration, retain the furnishings used by their predecessors. The retired furnishings are very often moved to White House storage facilities for incoming presidents to choose from, or in other rooms in the White House. The flooring in the current Oval Office has had four different revisions: the first (the cork flooring) being built in 1934 when the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the West Wing (which President Richard Nixon removed in 1969), the second (the linoleum flooring) from the 1969 Nixon renovations, the third, in a cross-parquet pattern, installed by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, and the fourth, the current, which has the same cross- parquet pattern as Reagan's, installed by President George W. Bush in 2005. * Category:Buildings and structures in Washington, D.C. Category:1909 establishments in the United States Category:20th-century establishments in Washington, D.C.",
