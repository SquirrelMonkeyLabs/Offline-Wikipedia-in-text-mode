The scientists who wrote the first paper about this frog said the adult male frog was 46.3–52.3 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog 46.2–51.2 mm long. The iris of the eye can be bronze in color or gray in color. It can have a blue ring in it. Sometimes there is only half a blue rung. The skin of its back is reddish or yellow in color. It has dark spots. There are wide, brown stripes down its back and all four legs. There is white color around these brown stripes. This frog has a thin white line on its mouth. It has a dark brown line from its nose to each eye. It has a dark brown line under its ear. It has dark spots near its jaw. Its belly is yellow or whitish in color. The insides of the back legs are dark brown with light spots. Male frogs sing for female frogs on the ground or on plants. They can sit up to 2 m off the ground. Scientists saw that the male frogs had scars on their backs. The scars were not deep. The scientists think the male frogs might fight each other. The frog is named after the Paranaíba River. The name paranabia comes from the Tupi language. It means \"large river with muddy water.\" The Tupi people live near where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
