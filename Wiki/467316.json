Panglao is separated from the Bohol island by a narrow strait, the Tagbilaran Strait, and two bridges connect the island with the city of Tagbilaran. There are several smaller islands close to Panglao, such as Gak- ang, Pontod, and Balicasag. Panglao has a terrain that range from plain, hilly to mountainous, composed by a limestone that is soluble and that causes the formation of caves and sinkholes. One interesting geological feature of the island is the Hinagdanan Cave which has an underground water source; because there no rivers or lakes in the island, the cave is an important water source. ==Biodiversity== During the works of the Panglao Marine Biodiversity Project, about 250 new species of crustaceans and 1,500-2,500 new species of mollusks were found in the waters of Panglao and Balicasag. The project found that Panglao alone has more marine biodiversity than Japan and the Mediterranean sea. Because of this biodiversity, the island was proposed in 2006 as a World Heritage Site by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines. ==Administrative divisions== The island of Panglao is within the Bohol province, and is divided into 2 municipalties and 22 barangays (like neighbourhoods).
