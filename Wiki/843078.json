 "text": "\"The Man from G.R.A.M.P.A.\" is the 21st episode of The Simpsons 32nd season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 16, 2021. It was written by Carolyn Omine and Michael Polcino is the director of the episode. == Story == Terrance (a spy from the MI5) is looking for a Russian spy who is known as \"The Grey Fox\". He learns that The Grey Fox is in a town in America with a nuclear power plant. He goes to Springfield and starts to think that Grampa Simpson is the Russian spy. Terrance talks to Grampa's son Homer about what he thinks of Grampa. Homer wants to help Terrance with finding the spy. They go to a beach and find Grampa taking a cane. Grampa is given an envelope from two men who look like Russians. Terrance later kidnaps Homer and Grampa. Chief Wiggum follows Terrance's car with Marge and arrests him. Grampa makes Terrance feel better by pretending to be The Grey Fox. == Reception == Tony Sokol from Den of Geek thought the references to British spy movies were not strong enough. Sokol also thought the humor was not strong, but he called the episode clever. Jesse Bereta from Bubbleblabber thought that the episode was not too exciting, saying \"it is more about convincing Homer that his father is a spy more than any actual spy work.\" However, Bereta said \"it was a fun episode that tried something different.\" == References == == Other websites == * Category:The Simpsons (season 32) episodes Category:2021 television episodes",
