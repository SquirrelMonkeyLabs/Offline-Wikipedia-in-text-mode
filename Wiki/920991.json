 "text": "The St. Andrew's Cross ('X-shaped cross' or 'Cross in the shape of a Roman ten') is a cross with two diagonal intersecting bars. It cross consists of slanting beams (also of different lengths), the term sloping cross is also used. There is this cross often at a level crossing. The name refers to the apostle Andrew, who is said to have died as a martyr on such a cross, reports from the 4th century suggest. The diagonal cross has therefore become an attribute of this apostle and found expression in religion and especially in late medieval Christian iconography. Originally a symbol of the crossed sticks of the fire sacrificial altar, it can also be found in depictions of the sacrifice of Isaac. It also contains the Greek letter Chi (Î§) as a symbol for Christ, as in the Christ monogram. Especially in early Christian times, the St. Andrew's cross was often used for the name of Christ, e.g. B. was used as an identifier. == Symbolism == The cross is a national symbol in the flag of Scotland and as such has also entered the British national flag. The flag of the Basque Country also has such an element. Also, as a traditional Orthodox symbol, the St. Andrew's Cross has become part of the flag of the Russian Navy (naval warfare flag). In heraldry, the St. Andrew's Cross is also called tray cross. The common figures arranged crosswise are then placed in tiers (also tiered) or diagonally crossed. The cross can also appear as a herald image in the coat of arms and follows the possible representation of crosses. An older heraldic expression is the shield ten, based on the Roman ten (X), which reflects the shape of the St. Andrew's Cross. In a narrower and smaller version, the herbalist uses the French term flan chis, as in the Amsterdam coat of arms.
