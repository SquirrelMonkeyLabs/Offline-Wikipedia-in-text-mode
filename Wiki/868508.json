 "text": "Turbotronic is a joystick made by Camerica in the late 1980s. It can connect to a Nintendo Entertainment System (7 pins) or an Atari joystick port (9 pins), used with multiple Atari and Commodore home computers, game consoles and the Sega Master System. The Turbotronic and Freedom Stick, a wireless, infrared version only for the Nintendo Entertainment System that came out in 1988, looks like the NES Advantage, released by Nintendo of America in 1987, so Nintendo sued Camerica. It later became a new product, Supersonic the Joystick. A triangular base for right-handed and left-handed use was added, and suction cups at the bottom to keep it stable. Freedom Stick and Supersonic the Joystick are some of the first game controllers to use infrared. Br√∏derbund's U-Force does it with no hands. ==Related pages== * Power Glove ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:Joysticks",
