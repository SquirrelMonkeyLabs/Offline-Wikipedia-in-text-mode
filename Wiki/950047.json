She was described a slender but strong woman. As a preperation for the 1951 Asian Games she went with the national team on a training camp in Djokja in January 1951. However, Surjowati left the camp already after the first day stating \"I have to look after my children anyway\". Altough she left the camp, she was selected for the Games to compete in the javelin throw, discus throw and 4x 100 metres relay. In the throwing numbers, it was stated she might win because she threw further than the other Asian women prior to the Games. At the 1951 Asian Games she didnâ€™t win a medal in the throwing events but won with the relay team the bronze medal in the 4x 100 metres event behind Japan and India. At the 1951 National Sports Week she finished third in the high jump event. She won again the bronze medal in 1953. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Javelin throwers Category:Indonesian discus throwers Category:High jumpers Category:1920s births",
