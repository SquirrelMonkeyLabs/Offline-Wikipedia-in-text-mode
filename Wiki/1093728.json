 "text": "Havo is a song sung by Konsta. The release date was June 25, 2023 with a official music video. The song mainly focuses on environmental problems and people who are uninterested to them. In the song, it is noted that due to the building in Tashkent, air quality is greatly damaged. During the song, the phrase \"I can't get enough of my breath these days\" was repeated many times, and the singer himself commented on it: > \"It's a very simple statement, but you'll hear this phrase repeatedly in the > song because after you take a breath, you have to stop and catch your > breath. Because nowadays, a person can't get enough of his breath just by > breathing. I breathe like this because of the dust.\" Scenes in the clip focus on land, dust and other environmental effects. The constant construction of houses, the continuous cutting of trees, and the fact that the city is \"like a cage\", there is not enough air for people, and the fact that weddings are held in such a state reveals the main idea of the clip. == References == == Other websites == * Category:2023 songs",
