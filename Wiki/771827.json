 "text": "Clwyd (pronounced Cloid) is one of the eight preserved counties of Wales. It was created in 1974 and was named after the River Clwyd which flowed through it. In 1996, it was abolished and four new unitary authorities were created. These were Wrexham County Borough, Conwy County Borough, Denbighshire, and Flintshire. Clwyd became a preserved county. It was in the north-east of Wales. To the north, it bordered the Irish Sea. To the north-east, it shared a maritime border with the English county of Merseyside, across the River Dee. To the east, it bordered Cheshire and bordered Shropshire to the south-east, both also in England. To the south, it bordered Powys and bordered Gwynedd to the west. Clwyd's county town was Mold, which is today part of Flintshire. The county's largest town was Wrexham, which is today its own borough. Category:Preserved counties of Wales",
