 "text": "In July and August 2024, attacks occurred in different cities in England and Northern Ireland. The event that caused these attacks was an attack on a children's dance school, where three children were killed, and several injured. This attack happened on 29 July in the town of Southport. On 30 July 2024, a crowd attacked the mosque in Southport. Many people had falsely thought that the attack the day before had been done by a Muslim immigrant. The crowd also attacked police officers, threw objects at the mosque and set a police car on fire. More than fifty police officers were injured. Some of them had serious injuries. On 2 August, riots took place in Sunderland, where a police station was set on fire, three police officers were injured and several people were arrested. In the following days, anti-immigration protesters clashed with police and counterprotesters, attacked immigrant-owned homes and businesses, and attacked hotels housing asylum seekers. From 7 August, anti- racist rallies far outnumbered far-right demonstrators. The attackers have been described as far-right. The attacks have been described as being Islamophobic, racially-charged, anti-immigration, and far-right. The fascist National Front party spread wrong information online, and a very well-known member of the neo-Nazi group Patriotic Alternative took part in the riots (violent demonstrations). == Notes == == References == Category:Southport Category:Riots in England Category:July 2024 events Category:August 2024 events Category:2024 in the United Kingdom",
