 "text": "In psychology, frustration is a common emotional way to act when things go wrong. It is a feeling of being angry and sad when something one wants or wishes for does not happen. In physics, frustration (or geometrical frustration) is a property of water molecules in ice when a freezing crystal is formed. The presence of random or conflicting atoms stop the ice from being completely frozen. It is called \"water ice\". Category:Psychology Category:Physics",
