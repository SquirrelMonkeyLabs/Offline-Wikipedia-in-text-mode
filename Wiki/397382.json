Judah's childhood friend Messala returns home as an ambitious commanding officer of the Roman legions. The two men realize that they have changed and hold very different views. During a military parade, a tile falls from the roof of Judah's house. It barely misses the Roman governor. Although Messala knows that they are not guilty, he condemns the Ben-Hur family. Without trial, Judah is sent to the Roman galleys for life; his mother and sister are imprisoned and all the family property is confiscated. Through good fortune, Judah survives and returns to Jerusalem, where he seeks revenge against his one-time friend and redemption for his family.

With the Crucifixion, Ben-Hur recognizes that the Christ stands for a different goal than revenge, and he becomes Christian, turning to supporting the new religion with money which he has inherited, inspired by love and the talk of keys to a greater kingdom than any on earth. ==References== Notes Category:1950s epic movies Category:Movies based on books Category:1959 movies Category:Peplum movies Category:MGM movies Category:American epic movies Category:Movies directed by William Wyler Category:Movies set in the 1st century Category:Movies set in Ancient Rome Category:Movies set in Israel Category:Movies set in Jerusalem Category:Movies about Jews and Judaism Category:Movies about Christianity Category:Movies about miscarriage of justice Category:Movies about slavery Category:Movies about revenge Category:Movies about atonement Category:Movies about child death",
