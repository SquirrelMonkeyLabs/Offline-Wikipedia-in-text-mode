 "text": "Area code 868 is a telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan. It covers Trinidad and Tobago, including major cities like Port of Spain, San Fernando, and Chaguanas. Area code 868 was established in 1997 when it was split from area code 809, which originally served the entire Caribbean region. This change was made to accommodate the growing demand for phone numbers in Trinidad and Tobago. The digits \"868\" spell \"TNT\" which stand for Trinidad and Tobago. Category:Area codes",
