 "text": "Malt is cereal grain that is sprouted and then dried by hot air. It is sometimes used in brewing and the manufacture of malt vinegar. Malt is high in sugar because when the grain sprouts, much of its starch changes to sugar. If the malt is dried with fire, it can have a smoky flavor. The sugar from the malt can be fermented into beer and whisky. Category:Sweeteners",
