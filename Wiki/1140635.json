 "text": "Skandagupta's war with the invaders were a series of invasions by the invading hoardes of Hunas, Kidarites (Kushans) and Sassanians (Pahlavas). They were eventually defeated and repelled by the young King, Skandagupta. == Prelude == The Kushans defeated the Sasanian monarch Shapur II. Later, during the years of 388 to 450, the Sasanian-Kidarite Wars have come about. After Yazdegerd II quelled a rebellion. He marched against the Hepthalites, which resulted to his defeat. From their base at Herat in Afghanistan, the Hunas (Hepthalites) had already invaded Persia and started moving southwards to the northwestern frontiers as they intrude upon the Gupta Empire's territory. == Skandagupta's wars against the invaders == During Skandagupta's period, the Indo-Hephthalites (known as the White Huns or Hunas) invaded India from the northwest, advancing as far as the Indus River. ===Battle of the Indus river (458 A.D.)=== During the Hun invasion, a battle along the Indus river took place which resulted in Skandagupta checking the advances of the Hunas, along with heavy losses for the Hunas. The Bhitari pillar inscription states that Skandagupta defeated the Hunas: === Victory against the invaders === The date of the Huna invasion is not certain. The Bhitari inscription mentions it after describing the conflict with the Pushyamitras (or the Yudhyamitras), which suggests that it happened later during Skandagupta's reign. However, a possible reference to this conflict in the Junagadh inscription suggests that it may have happened at the beginning of the Skandagupta's reign or during the reign of his father Kumaragupta. The Junagadh inscription, dated to the year 138 of the Gupta era (c. 457–458 CE) mentions Skandagupta's success against the invaders: The victory against the invaders happened in or before the year 136 of the Gupta era (-456 CE), when Skandagupta ascended the throne and when he appointed Parnadatta as the governor of the Saurashtra region, in which Junagadh is located. Since Skandagupta is not known to have fought against any other foreigners, these invaders were probably the Hunas. If this identification is correct, it is possible that as a prince, Skandagupta was sent to check the Huna invasion at the frontier, and Kumaragupta died in the capital while this conflict was happening; Skandagupta returned to the capital and overcame rebels or rival claimants to ascend the throne. A sentence in the Sanskrit text Chandra-Vyakarana () states Ajayad-Gupto Hunan, literally, \"The Gupta conquered the Hunas\". This may be a reference to Skandagupta's victory over the Hunas, although an alternative reading by scholar K. P. Jayaswal has \"Jato\" instead of \"Gupto\". A story in the Kathasaritsagara (11th century) states that the legendary king Vikramaditya ascended the throne after his father Mahendraditya abdicated it, and inflicted a crushing defeat on the invaders. Since Mahendraditya was a title of Kumaragupta, and Vikramaditya that of Skandagupta, this may be a reference to Skandagupta's victory over the Hunas. Mahendraditya was the title of Kumaragupta, in fact it seems that he sent his army under Skandagupta to check the progress of the invaders (which included the hoardes of the Hunas/Hepthalites, Persians/Sasanians and Kidarites/Kushanas) who invaded the northwestern frontiers and territory of the Gupta Empire, eventually, the wars and invasion were repelled by Skandagupta.\"Soon after this triumph the Hepthalites moved southwards and crossing the Indus and swooped down upon the Gupta empire in 455 A.D. But Skandagupta beat them back, as we gather from the Bhitari inscription.\" Line 12 of the Bhitari pillar inscription of Skandagupta : \"Who, when (his) father had attained the skies, conquered (his) enemies by the strength of (his) arm, and established again the ruined fortunes of (his) lineage; and then, crying \"the victory has been achieved\" betook himself to (his) mother, whose eyes were full of tears from joy, just as Krishna, when he had slain (his) enemies, betook himself to (his mother) Dêvakî\" == Notes and Aftermath == Gupta Kings.
