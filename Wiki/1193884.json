 "text": "The Seal of the Vice President of the United States is used to mark correspondence from the Vice President to other members of the Government, and is also used as a symbol of the Vice Presidency. ==Uses of the seal== The only official seal of the U.S. vice president is a brass die in their office, used to make wax impressions on official documents. It measures 1¾ inches (4.4 cm) across. Other versions, called facsimiles, are made by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for things like stationery and invitations, when requested. These other seals are often used as symbols to represent the vice president. They appear on podiums during speeches and on vehicles like Air Force Two, Marine Two, and limousines. The coat of arms, without the words around it, is also used on the Vice Presidential Service Badge and the vice president’s flag. ===Regulated use=== In general, commercial use of the seal is prohibited by 18 USC 713 of the United States Code, and further defined by Executive Orders 11916 and 11649, the same statutes which protect the seal of the president of the United States. == References == Category:Federal government of the United States",
