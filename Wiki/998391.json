 "text": "Ma Aeint () is a Burmese filmmaker and writer, best known for her 2020 film, Money Has Four Legs. After the 2021 Myanmar coup d'Ã©tat, the military junta jailed her on 5 June 2021 at Insein Prison, for her participation in Money Has Four Legs. While in prison, interrogation authorities broke her legs. In April 2022, she was punished to 3 years of hard labour under section 505(a) of Myanmar's Penal Code. Her punishment was attacked by PEN America and the international filmmaking community, including the International Coalition for Filmmakers at Risk, the Directors Guild of Japan, eleven South Korean film festivals led by the Busan International Film Festival, and Southeast Asia Fiction Film Lab. In September 2022, actress Julianne Moore led a flash-mob protest at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, calling for the release of Ma Aeint and other filmmakers in jail. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Articles with hCards",
