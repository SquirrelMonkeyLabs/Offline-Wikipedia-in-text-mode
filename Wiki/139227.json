It has social groups of four to twelve individuals. == Disease == Sooty mangabeys are naturally infected with a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). Due to extensive human-mangabey contact in sub- Saharan Africa, the virus has jumped from this species into humans on many occasions. This resulted in the HIV-2 virus. The HIV-1 strain by contrast came from the common chimpanzee strain of SIV.Lemey P. et al 2003. Tracing the origin and history of the HIV-2 epidemic.
