 "text": "Gianluca De Novi is an Italian computer scientist, professor and director of the Medical Device and Simulation Laboratory at Harvard University. He holds a faculty position at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham. He is known for his work in fields of Haptic technology, robotics, medical simulation, and surgical robotics. == Biography == De Novi was born and raised in Bernalda. He graduated with a master's degree in Electronics Engineering. He later obtained a Ph.D. in Robotics and Control Systems from University of Bologna. He immigrated to the United States for research purposes. He completed his fellowship at postdoctoral fellowship at the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. Nine months after his appointment as faculty, De Novi became the Director of the Medical Device and Simulation Laboratory within the imaging department. In 2012, he founded Hintivision after patenting a technology for smart advertising. In 2014, he began serving as a Scientific and Strategic Advisor at ADM Tronics Unlimited, Inc., a medical device manufacturing company. The same year, he founded Triotech Ventures, a consortium of American medical device companies. In 2016, De Novi worked as a Faculty Instructor at Harvard Extension School, teaching Augmented/Virtual Reality Rendering for Simulation and Gaming. In 2018, he co- founded XSurgical Robotics, a company focused on developing surgical robots with the goal of achieving fully autonomous surgical procedures through the use of Artificial Intelligence. == Research == De Novi's academic research has primarily focused on computer-based surgical simulation, beginning with an exploration of graphic rendering technologies and the development of a comprehensive virtual reality framework specialized for surgery simulation from 2004 to 2013. During his postdoctoral fellowship, he expanded his research to include real-time gesture analysis, task recognition, and augmented reality within the context of surgery simulation. == Selected publications == * * * * * == References == == Other websites == * Google scholar's profile * Harvard profile Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Computer scientists Category:Italian scientists",
