 "text": "A breeder reactor is a type of nuclear reactor designed to produce more fissile material (usually plutonium-239) than it consumes while generating electricity. == Process == A breeder reactor converts non-fissile uranium-238 into fissile material through a process called breeding. In breeder reactors, fast neutrons are used to initiate nuclear fission, and as the reactor operates, it creates more fissile material than it consumes, making it an efficient way to generate nuclear fuel. Breeder reactors have the potential to significantly extend the availability of nuclear fuel resources and reduce nuclear waste, but they also come with challenges related to safety and proliferation concerns.
