 "text": "Daniel Johnston (January 22, 1961 - September 11, 2019) was an American songwriter, singer, and artist who lived in Texas. Johnston has bipolar disorder. The movie The Devil and Daniel Johnston is about his life and music career. Born in Sacramento, California, Johnston grew up in West Virginia in a Christian family. He became a Beatles fan when he was young, then went off to college but did not finish. He moved to Texas to live with his brother, and ended up joining a circus. He left the circus after another worker beat him up for taking too long in a restroom, and found a church in Austin, Texas that helped him find somewhere to live. Johnston's religious beliefs are mentioned in many of his songs, especially on his album 1990. Johnston's music career started in Austin in the 1980s. He made cassette tapes of songs he performed on a chord organ and gave many of them out for free to people he met. He started playing concerts and became very popular with music fans in Texas. Johnston appeared on MTV, and became even more popular when Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt with the cover art of one of Johnston's CDs. Johnston released one album on Atlantic Records, a major record label (a big company that helps make albums and sells them around the world) called Fun in 1994. However, he was not able to make any more albums with Atlantic Records because not enough people bought Fun. However, Johnston kept writing songs, and his drawings appeared on the covers of his albums. His last album was Space Ducks:Soundtrack, which came out in 2012. Johnston died of a suspected heart attack at his home in Waller, Texas on September 11, 2019. He was 58. ==Albums released on CD== *Yip/Jump Music (1983) *Hi, How Are You (1983) *Continued Story with Texas Instruments (1985) *A Texas Trip (1987) *1990 (1990) *Artistic Vice (1991) *Fun (1994) *Why Me?
