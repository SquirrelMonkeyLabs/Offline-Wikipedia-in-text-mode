 "text": "Kodi (originally called XBMC) is a open source media player made by the Kodi Foundation, a nonprofit organization. The software is available for many different operating systems with a menu made for televisions. The software allows users to get media such as videos and music from the Internet, and allows users to load media from external media such as a USB flash drive or DVD. It was originally made as a home-theater PC application that could run on many different types of computers but now has become a multi-purpose program that can run plug-ins (which are similar to applications) similarly to a operating system. The media player can have its look changed using skins and allow users to watch content from streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu using plug-ins. == Hardware requirements == Requirements Minimum Recommended CPU SSE2 processor (IA-32 or ARM32) ARM64 or x64 processor RAM 1 GB RAM 2 GB+ RAM GPU OpenGL 4.1 OpenGL 4.5+ HDD 4-8 GB HDD 16 GB HDD Kodi claims to officially support any computer made in the last 10 years with the minimum requirements on their official website. == References == Category:Software",
