It can be played as a free version with advertisements, or a paid version without ads. == Gameplay == The rules of the game are essentially the same as Scrabble. Some features are different, such as where bonus tiles are, and the points scored by some letters. Players have 7 randomly picked tiles. These tiles are filled whenever some are played on the board until all of the tiles have been used. Players take turns putting words on the board. If they do not play a word, they can swap tiles with ones not yet used, or pass their turn. Words can be placed up and down, or left and right. Players want to score as many points as they can. The game ends when a player has no more tiles, and there are no more tiles in the bag. After the last tile is played, the other player will lose points for the total score of their tiles. These points are given to the person who played the final move. The player with the highest score wins. Players can move their tiles around. They can also reorder them by pressing a button or shaking the device. Players can quit games if they want to. The game has two more features, \"tile bag\" and \"word-o-meter\", both can be used for free. 173,000 words can be played. The list of words used is based on the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE). == Origin == The game was made by brothers Paul and David Bettner. They were the owners of Newtoy Inc. at the time. == Board game == In 2012, Zynga produced many physical board games of Words with Friends in association with Hasbro. There is a normal version, a \"Luxe\" version with a board that turns, and a \"To Go\" travel version == References == Category:2009 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Casual games Category:Facebook games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Social casual games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Word games",
