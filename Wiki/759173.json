On 15 March 2020, President Mart√≠n Vizcarra announced a country-wide lockdown, closing borders, slowing down domestic travel, and ending nonessential business, except health facilities, food vendors, pharmacies, and financial institutions. Peru, with a total population of 32 million, had a total of 500 intensive care unit (ICU) beds available as of April 2020, and was working on expanding its nation-wide ventilator system from 40 to 540 machines within the coming months.
