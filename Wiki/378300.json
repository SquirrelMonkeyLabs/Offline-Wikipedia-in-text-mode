 "text": "P.M. Dawn are an American Hip hop-R&B; duo from Jersey City, New Jersey. The duo consists of Prince Be, Doc.G. and K-R.O.K. The band was created in 1988 by brothers Attrell Cordes (Prince Be) and former member Jarrett Cordes (DJ Minutemix). Attrell and Jarrett's father died when they were young so they were raised by their mother and step father George Brown, who was a founding member of Kool & The Gang. \"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\" from their debut album Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience is one of their best known songs and reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #3 on the United Kingdom. Prince Be suffered a massive stroke in early 2005 and had a second stroke which caused a gangrenous infection in his right leg on February 12, 2009. His leg had to be amputated below the kneecap because of a result of the infection. == Discography == ===Studio albums=== *Of the Heart, of the Soul and of the Cross: The Utopian Experience (1991) *The Bliss Albumâ€¦?
