 "text": "Bulletstorm is a first-person shooter video game made by People Can Fly and Epic Games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The game came under negative criticism by Fox News for it's use of profanity, crude behavior, and sexual innuendo. Electronic Arts responded to this saying, \"As you know, Bulletstorm is a work of entertainment fiction... The game and its marketing adhere to all guidelines set forth by the ESRB; both are designed for people 17+...Much like Tarantino's Kill Bill or Rodriguez's Sin City, this game is an expression of creative entertainment for adults.\" ==References== ==Other websites== * Category:2011 video games Category:Electronic Arts video games Category:Epic Games games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Cooperative video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Virtual reality games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games",
