 "text": "Snoring sometimes happens during sleep and it can affect some people more than others, or some not at all. The parts which vibrate during snoring are at the back of the nose and throat. They may partly block the passage of air, so causing the characteristic rumbling sound. Snoring can be a problem, and tends to get worse with age. It is sometimes best to sleep on the side (left side), which can reduce snoring. == References == *Nestor, James 2020. Breath: the new science of a lost art. Riverhead Books.
