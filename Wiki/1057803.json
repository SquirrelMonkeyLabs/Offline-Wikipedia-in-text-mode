 "text": "The WAGR K class was one 0-6-2 side tank steam locomotive operated by the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) from 1891, before becoming the L class in 1894. K class No. 19 was built by Hudswell Clarke & Coy of Leeds, England specifically for the construction of Fremantle Harbour being transferred to the Public Works Department (PWD) almost immediately after it arrived for the construction of the North Mole. When the loco was transferred back to the WAGR both the K class designation and the number 19 were occupied by other unrelated locomotives, so the engine was reclassified No. 5 and as part of the first L class.
