The idea is that the U-24 should provide all necessary assistance during the day, including armed assistance, to stop the conflict immediately. In addition, such an association \"could provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters. Who fell victim to a humanitarian crisis or epidemic\". The idea is that the U-24 should provide all necessary assistance, including armed assistance, within a 24 hour response window.Pravda (Правда) (17 Mar 2022) Zelenskyy explained the essence of the new military alliance U24 from Zelenskyy's night address verbatim: \"I addressed the United States and all responsible states with a proposition to create a new U24 union: a new union that will ensure that each aggressor receives a coordinated world response quickly, effectively, and immediately - not in weeks, months, years, but for the first 24 hours after the attack.\" \"We can no longer trust existing institutions. We cannot expect bureaucrats in international organisations to change fast enough, so we must look for new guarantees, create new tools, and to build alliances with those who have the courage to do what justice demands.\" == References == Category:2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Category:2022 establishments in Europe",
