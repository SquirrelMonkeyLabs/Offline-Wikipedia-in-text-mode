The different types of money are typically classified as \"M\"s. The \"M\"s usually range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest) but which \"M\"s are actually focused on in policy formulation depends on the country's central bank. The typical layout for each of the \"M\"s is as follows: Type of money M0 MB M1 M2 M3 MZM Notes and coins in circulation (outside Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions) (currency) ✓\"Gold, Oil, Stocks, Investments, Currencies, and the Federal Reserve: Growth of Global Money Supply\" .
