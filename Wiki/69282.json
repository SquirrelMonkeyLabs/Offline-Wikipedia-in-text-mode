 "text": "The University of Padua (Italian Universit√† degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD) is in Padua, Italy. It was created in 1222. It is one of the oldest European universities and the second oldest in Italy. As of 2003, the university had about 65,000 students. == History == The university is usually said to have been founded in 1222 when a big group of students and professors left the University of Bologna. They did this to look for more academic freedom ('Libertas scholastica'). The first subjects to be taught were law and theology. The curriculum got bigger quickly, and by 1399 the institution had divided in two: a Universitas Iuristarum for civil law and Canon law, and a Universitas Artistarum which taught astronomy, dialectic, philosophy, grammar, medicine, and rhetoric. == Related pages == *Padua == References == ==Other websites== *University of Padua Website *Museums of the University Padua Category:1222 establishments Category:Padua Category:1220s establishments in Europe Category:13th-century establishments in Italy",
