 "text": "The Cryptomonads (or Cryptophyta) are a phylum of algae, most of which have chloroplasts. They are common in freshwater, and also occur in marine and brackish habitats. Each cell is around 10-50 Î¼m in size and flattened in shape, with an anterior groove or pocket. At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella. Some may exhibit mixotrophy, using mixed sources of energy. == References == Category:Algae Category:Protista",
