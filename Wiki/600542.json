 "text": "This article lists the 100 oldest living current or former state leaders whose age can be demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. State leaders are defined to include heads of state (including representatives who act in their stead, generally a governor-general), heads of government and internationally recognized de facto leaders of sovereign states with significant international recognition. Leaders are not included if no reliable secondary sources have confirmed that the leader is alive within the last 10 years. ==Gallery== File:Guillermo Rodriguez (Ecuador).jpg|Oldest living: Guillermo Rodríguez served: 1972-1976 File:Tomiichi Murayama 19940630.jpg|2nd-oldest: Tomiichi Murayama served 1994-1996 File:18th Summit of Non-Aligned Movement gets underway in Baku 007 (cropped).jpg|3rd-oldest: Mahathir Mohamad served 1981-2003 and 2018-2020 File:Raif Dizdarević (političar).jpg|Oldest living of a now-defunct state and 7th-oldest living: Raif Dizdarević 1988–1989 File:Paul Biya 2014.png|Oldest living incumbent and 54th-oldest living: Paul Biya 1975–present ==List== Name State Position Birth Age 1 Acting President (1972–1976) 2 Prime Minister (1994–1996) 3 Prime Minister (1981–2003;
