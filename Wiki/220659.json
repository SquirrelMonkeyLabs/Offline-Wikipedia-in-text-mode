 "text": "Blackberry pie is a pie made of blackberry filling, most of the time in the form of either blackberry jam, blackberries themselves, or sometimes both. Blackberries must be stewed or soaked in water before baking to stop burning. Fresh frozen blackberries sweetened with brown sugar nestled under a double crust and served with ice cream are usually eaten in summer, and many people enjoy them as a summer favorite. When Abraham Lincoln was made President of the United States in 1861, blackberry pie was served at the inauguration lunch. ==Gallery== File:Heda, Willem Claeszoon - Breakfast Table with Blackberry Pie - detail pie.jpg|A painting of a blackberry pie, by Dutch painter, Willem Claesz Heda (1594â€”1680) File:Blackberry Pie 956px.jpg|A blackberry pie with a crust design of hearts on the top ==Related pages== *Pie ==References== Category:Desserts Category:Pies Category:Fruit dishes",
