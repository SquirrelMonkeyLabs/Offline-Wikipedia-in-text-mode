 "text": "Partygate is an ongoing political scandal about (social gatherings or) parties that were held by the staff of United Kingdom government and Conservative Party It was made public in 2021. The parties took place during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, when there were public health restrictions. These parties happened at 10 Downing Street and other government buildings. In December 2021, reports of parties being held in 2020 and in 2021 were released. Prime Minister Boris Johnson often hosted these parties, though at first he denied having parties. The Metropolitan Police started an investigation over the parties. On 10 January 2022, ITV News reported that a planned party had taken place on 20 May 2020. At the time, people outdoors were not allowed to meet more than one person from outside their household. Two days later, Johnson apologised to MPs in the Commons for \"attending an event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown\". Some conservatives criticized Johnson and wanted him to resign. A police investigation into the parties were announced. On 12 April 2022, Prime Minister Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak were fined for breaking COVID protocols. ==References== Category:December 2021 events Category:January 2022 events",
