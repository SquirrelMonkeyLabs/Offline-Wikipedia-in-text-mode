 "text": "The Uukuniemi Movement (Finnish: Uukuniemeläisyys) is a Finnish Lutheran revival movement originating in the 18th century in Uukuniemi, located in southeastern Finland. It is considered part of Finland’s wider pietistic traditions, emphasizing personal spirituality, repentance, and Bible study. The movement remains active in small communities today. == Origins == # Pietistic roots: The movement traces its origins to the influence of Pietism, a reform movement within Lutheranism that stressed personal devotion over formal church rituals. In Uukuniemi, these ideas took root among farmers and lay preachers. # Key figures: Lay leaders were central to the movement, as they organized prayer meetings and Bible readings in homes and fields, fostering a sense of spiritual independence among followers. == Beliefs and practices == * Emphasis on repentance: Followers stress the importance of acknowledging sin and seeking forgiveness through prayer and faith. * Bible- Centered Worship: The movement prioritizes direct engagement with the Bible, encouraging personal study and interpretation. * Community Focus: Worship is often communal, held in homes or local meeting spaces rather than formal church buildings. == Relations with the Lutheran Church == While the movement has always identified as Lutheran, its emphasis on lay leadership and personal spirituality sometimes brought it into conflict with the official Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. However, over time, relations have normalized, and the movement is now recognized as part of Finland’s religious heritage. == Legacy == The Uukuniemi Movement played a significant role in shaping Finnish pietism and religious life in rural communities. Its teachings and practices continue to influence modern Finnish spirituality, though the movement itself remains small and localized.
