 "text": "The first inauguration of Ulysses S. Grant as the 18th president of the United States took place on March 4, 1869. The inauguration was the beginning of the first four-year term of Ulysses S. Grant as President and the only term of Schuyler Colfax as Vice President. This inauguration was the first that both living parents of the president attended. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the oath of office. Andrew Johnson did not attend the inaugural ceremonies, as President-elect Grant refused to sit with him in the carriage going to it. Instead, he was in the White House signing last-minute legislation. ==References== Category:1869 in North America Category:Ulysses S. Grant Grant, Ulysses S.
