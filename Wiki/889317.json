Tiny houses can stand on a fixed place, but they can also be mobile. For example, a tiny house with wheels can be transported. They may also solve other kinds of problems. They may be a way for older children to have independence, yet also stay near their parents. Sometimes the family home is too small for children to have their own bedroom. A tiny house built in the grounds of a regular property may be the solution to allowing independence whilst keeping a degree of parental supervision. == History == The tiny house movement originated in the United States. Tiny houses gained more attention after the Great Recession, when houses became very expensive in many places. == Media == The tiny house movement has inspired many reality television series: * Mighty Tiny Houses (HGTV) * Terrific Tiny Homes (DIY) * Tiny House, Big Living (HGTV) * Tiny House Builders (HGTV) * Tiny House Hunters (HGTV) * Tiny House Hunting (FYI) * Tiny House Nation (FYI and A&E;) * Tiny House World (FYI) * Tiny Luxury (HGTV) * Tiny Paradise (HGTV) == Related pages == * Affordable housing * Cottage == References == Category:Houses Category:Simple living",
