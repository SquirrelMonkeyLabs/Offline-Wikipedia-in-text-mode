 "text": "Jacques-Louis David (30 August 1748 â€“ 29 December 1825) was a politician and an artist who lived during the French Revolution. As a politician, he is most famous for being one of the handful of leaders that governed France during the most violent part of the French Revolution. David believed that France should not have a monarchy and instead it should be a Republic. He voted to have the King of France Louis XVI killed with the guillotine. When the French Revolution began to fail, David was happy that Napoleon Bonaparte became Emperor of France. As a painter, Jacques-Louis David wanted artwork to be political. He often painted heroes from myths or history that he believed represented good ideals such as strength, brotherhood, and virtue. His paintings are very realistic and often portray heroes from Ancient Greece and Rome. This is called the Neoclassical style of painting. One of David's most famous paintings is of his best friend Jean-Paul Marat who was killed during the French Revolution. David's painting helped make Marat into a popular martyred hero. He was also president of the National Convention from the 5th of January 1794, until the 20th. ==Gallery of his art== File:Jacques-Louis David, Le Serment des Horaces.jpg|Oath of the Horatii [1784] File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|The Death of Socrates [1787] File:David Brutus.jpg|The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons [1789] File:Serment du Jeu de Paume - Jacques-Louis David.jpg|The Tennis Court Oath 1790-1794 File:Jacques- Louis David - Marie Antoinette on the Way to the Guillotine.jpg|Marie Antoinette on the Way to the Guillotine [1793] File:Lepeletier-David 1.JPG|The Last Moments of Michel Lepeletier, The Death of Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau or Lepeletier on his Deathbed {1793} File:Death of Marat by David.jpg|The Death of Marat (1793) File:Bara David.jpg|The Death of Young Bara(1794) File:Lycurgus of Sparta, Jean-Jacques Le Barbier.jpg|Lycurgus of Sparta, [1790's] File:Sketch of Robespierre.jpg|Sketch of Robespierre on the day of his execution [1794] File:Jacques Louis David - Bonaparte franchissant le Grand Saint-Bernard, 20 mai 1800 - Google Art Project.jpg|Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass (1801) File:Jacques-Louis David, The Coronation of Napoleon edit.jpg|The Coronation of Napoleon [1807] == Related pages == * List of French painters Category:1748 births Category:1825 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Presidents of the National Convention Category:French painters",
