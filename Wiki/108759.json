 "text": "WrestleMania XXV (also known as the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania or WrestleMania 25), was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on April 5, 2009 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. It was the twenty-fifth yearly WrestleMania event held by WWE, and the second WrestleMania in the state of Texas, with the first being 2001's WrestleMania X-Seven, which was held at the Reliant Astrodome. The tagline for the event was \"Everything is bigger in Texas, especially WrestleMania\". \"Cowboy\" by Kid Rock was used in the first promotional advertisement for the event. While WWE called it the 25th Anniversary, it is only the 24th anniversary as WrestleMania I cannot be an anniversary of itself. ==Production== It was announced on January 30, 2009 that \"War Machine\" and \"Shoot to Thrill\", both by AC/DC, would be the theme songs for WrestleMania. ===Background=== Since 1993, the winner of the yearly Royal Rumble match at the event of the PPV has won the opportunity to wrestle for a World Championship at WrestleMania. The only Royal Rumble winners since 1993 that did not wrestle for a championship at WrestleMania are Steve Austin in 1997, and Mr. McMahon in 1999. Randy Orton won the match in 2009, earning a match for a world championship at WrestleMania XXV. On the March 2 episode of Raw, WWE Champion Triple H convinced Orton to challenge for his championship at WrestleMania. On the February 16 edition of Raw, Shawn Michaels challenged John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield to a match the following week for the right to face The Undertaker at WrestleMania. Michaels won this match but was then forced to face Vladimir Kozlov for the right to face Undertaker at WrestleMania. Michaels won this match and went on to face The Undertaker at WrestleMania. Money in the Bank qualifying matches started on the February 23, 2009 edition of Raw with a triple threat match between CM Punk, John Morrison, and The Miz. Punk won the match and became the first of eight men to be added to the Money in the Bank ladder match. The following week on Raw, another triple threat match took place between Rey Mysterio, Kane and Mike Knox, with the winner of this match qualifying for the ladder match. Kane won this match and as a result was added to the ladder match. ==Results== == References == == Other websites == *Official Website for 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania *Official Website for WrestleMania WrestleMania 25 Category:2009 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in Houston Category:2009 in American television Category:2000s in Houston Category:2009 in Texas",
