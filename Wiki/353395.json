In the winters they hibernate in caves and burrows with other snake species. They are very poor climbers. === Feeding=== Around 94% of a western diamondback rattlesnake's diet is made up of small mammals like the prairie dog, the kangaroo rat, the pocket gopher, the vole, the wood rat, the pocket mouse, the white-footed mouse, the harvest mouse, the ground squirrel, the rabbit and moles. They also eat lizards and birds. Some of the birds they eat are the mockingbirds, burrowing owls, black-throated sparrows, and the eastern meadowlark. The lizards they eat are the whiptail liazards, spiny lizards, Texas banded gecko, and the side-blotched lizard. They also eat insects like the ant, beetle, and grasshopper. They usually hunt in the early morning or at night. The western diamondback rattlesnake is eaten by coyotes, foxes, and hawks. == Reproduction== The western diamondback rattlesnake is, like all rattlesnakes, viviparous. A female is pregnant for around six to seven mouths before giving birth to her young. The young only stay with their mother for a few hours before leaving on their own to go and hunt. They mate in spring and the female gives birth to around 12 to 25 young at a time. When they are born they are around 30 cm (12 in) long. Young western diamondback rattlesnakes have a venomous bite from the moment they are born. Western diamondback rattlesnakes live for around 20 years. ==References== Category:Vipers Category:Snakes of North America",
