Reprise is best known for recording Neil Young since 1969. ==Company history== Reprise was formed in 1960Reprise Records story. by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings. He had earlier been with Capitol Records, but was upset when Capitol issued an album, Come Fly with Me, whose cover had a picture of him in front of an airplane with a Trans-World Airlines (TWA) logo. He believed Capitol and TWA were profiting together from his image, and left him out. Reprise's artists included Sinatra's longtime friend Dean Martin, who was a singer and comedian, with a popular television show. Sinatra's daughter, Nancy Sinatra, became a recording artist and singer, and signed with her father's label. (His advice to her, whoever she signed with, was to \"Own your own masters\", and she did that. Years later, her catalog was valuable, and she earned more money from her records than if she was not their owner.) Reprise also released records by Jimi Hendrix, and later Neil Young. ==Subsidiaries== * Kinetic Records (1992–2000) * Grand Jury Records (1990–1993) * Giant Records (1990–1994, Warner Brothers took over the duties until Giant folded.) * Vapor Records (1995–present; current status unknown) * Elementree Records (1995–2000) * In Bloom Records (1998–2000) * Chrysalis Records (1969–1972) ==Related pages== * List of record labels ==References== ==Other websites== * A discography of American Reprise singles from 1961 to 1970 Category:American record labels Category:1960 establishments in the United States",
