Most having a distinctive black and white appearance. == Other birds called \"magpie\" == There are other species of bird that are called 'magpies', though they are not true magpies. Oriental \"magpies\" are green and blue in colour, and belong to the genera Urocissa and Cissa. There is also one blue and white magpie, the azure-winged magpie Cyanopica cyana. There is the black magpie, which is really a treepie. There is also the Australian magpie. It is not a member of the crow family at all. It is in the Artamidae family. All of those birds are in a different genera from Pica. This is a good example of the confusion caused by common names, before the Linnaean system came into use. == Description == Magpies are large birds. They often have long tails. Magpies eat lots of different kinds of food. They may eat baby birds, eggs and carrion. They may also eat seeds and other parts of plants. Magpies are clever birds. They can pass the mirror test. This is when the bird sees itself in a mirror and understands that the bird reflected in the mirror, is itself. Contrary to popular belief, they do not have any attraction to bright, shiny things. == Related pages == *Yellow- billed magpie *Black-billed magpie == Other websites == * Magpie videos on the Internet Bird Collection * Magpie webcam - Live webcam stream Magpies & Blackbirds nest Category:Corvids",
