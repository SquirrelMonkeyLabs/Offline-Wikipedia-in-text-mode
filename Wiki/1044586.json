 "text": "The Abyssinian is one of the cat breeds. Its fur is mostly brown color and is short-haired. They are called Abys for short. == History == It is believed to be a natural breed in Ethiopia, and was brought to the United States and England by a British soldier during the war in 1868. Ethiopia was called Abyssinia at the time, hence the name Abyssinian. There is a legend that they are descended from cats that were kept in the palaces of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt, and although they resemble the cats in the murals, it is not known if this is true. There is also a legend that the Egyptian Mau, which has a similar history, is very similar in shape to the early Abyssinian, with only differents color and pattern, so the two species may have the same origin. == Description == === Appearance === Abyssinians have a slender, lithe body shape. They have long, slender legs and a wide, long tail. They also have small, hard, egg-shaped toes, which is why they're called \"ballet cats\". It has an M-shaped forehead and a rounded head with a slightly narrow mouth. The eyes are large and almond-shaped with a slight upward slant at the corners. The ears are pointed, large, and curved forward. It belongs to the short- haired breed and has six stripes across its body, also known as the Abyssinian tabby. It has reddish-brown coat, with two or three colors added to a single color. === Temperament === The Abyssinian's personality is gentle and affectionate, and they follow people well. They are quiet because they don't cry much, but they respond well to human voices. They are also intelligent and loyal. Abyssinians are known as \"Puppy cat\". It is easy to take it for a walk because of their dog-like personality. They also love to swim. == References == == Other websites == * FBRL Breed Page: Abyssinian Category:Cat breeds Category:Natural cat breeds",
