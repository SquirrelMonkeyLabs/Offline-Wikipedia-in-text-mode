Its creation was announced by father-and-son businessmen Shahid and Tony Khan, with the elder acting as the promotion's lead investor, and his son being the founder, president and CEO of the company. Professional wrestlers The Young Bucks (Matt & Nick Jackson) and Kenny Omega, founding members of a wrestling stable known as The Elite, are serving as both in-ring performers and executive vice presidents. Cody Rhodes, another wrestler who joined the stable shortly after it formed, was also an executive vice president before leaving the company in 2022. On October 2, 2024, AEW and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) both announced they they had agreed to a multi- year contract extension; the deal keeps AEW on TBS and TNT. HBO Max was also given the right to stream the weekly television shows alongside the channels and rights to broadcast AEW PPVs. == Shows == ===Weekly shows=== ==== Broadcast ==== Day Network Dynamite Dynamite Dynamite Dynamite Dynamite Dynamite Dynamite Wednesday TBS Rampage Rampage Rampage Rampage Rampage Rampage Rampage Friday TNT Collision Collision Collision Collision Collision Collision Collision Saturday TNT ==== Online ==== Day Network AEW Unrestricted AEW Unrestricted AEW Unrestricted AEW Unrestricted AEW Unrestricted AEW Unrestricted AEW Unrestricted Varies YouTube Being The Elite Being The Elite Being The Elite Being The Elite Being The Elite Being The Elite Being The Elite Varies YouTube ==== Former ==== Day Network Ran from AEW Dark AEW Dark AEW Dark AEW Dark AEW Dark AEW Dark AEW Dark Tuesday YouTube October 8, 2019 - April 25, 2023 AEW Dark: Elevation AEW Dark: Elevation AEW Dark: Elevation AEW Dark: Elevation AEW Dark: Elevation AEW Dark: Elevation AEW Dark: Elevation Monday YouTube March 15, 2021 – April 24, 2023 ===Pay-per-view events=== Date Name Venue City Main Event Ref May 25, 2019 Double or Nothing MGM Grand Garden Arena Paradise, NV Chris Jericho vs. Kenny Omega June 29, 2019 Fyter Fest Ocean Center Daytona Beach, FL Jon Moxley vs. Joey Janela July 13, 2019 Fight for the Fallen Daily's Place Jacksonville, FL The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) vs. The Brotherhood (Cody and Dustin Rhodes) August 31, 2019 All Out Sears Centre Arena Hoffman Estates, IL Chris Jericho vs. Adam Page for the inaugural AEW World Championship November 9, 2019 Full Gear Royal Farms Arena Baltimore, MD Jon Moxley vs. Kenny Omega February 29, 2020 Revolution Wintrust Arena Chicago, IL Chris Jericho vs. Jon Moxley for the AEW World Championship May 23, 2020 Double or Nothing Daily's Place Jacksonville, FL The Elite (Matt Jackson, Nick Jackson, Kenny Omega, Adam Page, and Matt Hardy) vs. The Inner Circle (Chris Jericho, Sammy Guevara, Jake Hager, Santana and Ortiz) September 5, 2020 All Out Daily's Place Jacksonville, FL Jon Moxley (c) vs. MJF for the AEW World Championship November 7, 2020 Full Gear Daily's Place Jacksonville, FL Jon Moxley (c) vs. Eddie Kingston in an \"I quit\" match for the AEW World Championship March 7, 2021 Revolution Daily's Place Jacksonville, FL Atlanta, GA Kenny Omega (c) vs. Jon Moxley in an Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch for the AEW World Championship May 30, 2021 Double or Nothing Daily's Place TIAA Bank Field Jacksonville, FL The Inner Circle (Chris Jericho, Jake Hager, Sammy Guevara, Santana and Ortiz) vs. The Pinnacle (MJF, Shawn Spears, Wardlow, Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) in a Stadium Stampede match September 5, 2021 All Out NOW Arena Hoffman Estates, IL Kenny Omega (c) vs. Christian Cage for the AEW World Championship November 13, 2021 Full Gear Target Center Minneapolis, MN Kenny Omega (c) vs. \"Hangman\" Adam Page for the AEW World Championship March 6, 2022 Revolution Addition Financial Arena Orlando, FL \"Hangman\" Adam Page (c) vs. Adam Cole for the AEW World Championship May 29, 2022 Double or Nothing T-Mobile Arena Paradise, NV \"Hangman\" Adam Page (c) vs. CM Punk for the AEW World Championship June 26, 2022 Forbidden Door United Center Chicago, IL Jon Moxley vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi for the interim AEW World Championship September 4, 2022 All Out NOW Arena Hoffman Estates, IL Jon Moxley vs. CM Punk for the unified AEW World Championship & interim championship == Championships and accomplishments == ===Champions=== Championship Current champion(s) Reign Date won Days held Location Notes AEW World Championship Jon Moxley 4 October 12, 2024 Tacoma, Washington Defeated Bryan Danielson at WrestleDream.
