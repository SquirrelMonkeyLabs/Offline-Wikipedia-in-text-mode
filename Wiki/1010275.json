Charlie and Lola's parents, as well as their friends' parents, are often mentioned, but never seen. The first book, I Will Never NOT EVER Eat a Tomato (US title, later printing with Greenaway Medal seal, 2000) ==History== The series' first book is I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato, published by Orchard Books in 2000. The U.S. edition was published in the same year by Candlewick Press, with the title: I Will Never NOT EVER Eat a Tomato. For that first book in the series, Child won the 2000 Kate Greenaway All-Medal Trophy from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject. For the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955â€“2005) it was named one of the top ten winning works, selected by a 2007 panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. The series was made into an animated TV show. ==References== == Other websites == * * * * CBeebies - Charlie and Lola at bbc.co.uk * Charlie and Lola theme tune * Charlie and Lola on Playhouse Disney Category:Fictional characters",
