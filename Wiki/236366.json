 "text": "Frederick II (1 July 1534 – 4 April 1588), was the king of Denmark-Norway and duke of Schleswig from 1559 to his death. He was the son of King Christian III of Denmark and Norway and Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg. He is often seen as the typical Renaissance ruler of Denmark. As a person, he was described as hot- headed, proud, brave and ambitious. He loved hunting, wine and feasts. At his death, many people thought that it had been caused by his drinking. He rebuilt Kronborg Castle, in Helsingør, between 1574 and 1585. In 1567, he founded Fredrikstad, Norway. It was a time of wealth and growth in Danish history. == Reference == Category:1534 births Category:1588 deaths Category:Kings and Queens of Denmark Category:Kings and Queens of Norway Category:House of Oldenburg",
