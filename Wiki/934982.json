 "text": "The 1936 Soviet Constitution also called the Stalin Constitution was the second constitution of the Soviet Union adopted by Joseph Stalin and it was the longest lasting of all Soviet constitutions, running for 31 years. The 1936 constitution nominally granted all manner of rights to the Soviet people. In practice however, this constitution helped cement Stalin's totalitarian power and rubberstamped the Great Purge and other Soviet purges.
