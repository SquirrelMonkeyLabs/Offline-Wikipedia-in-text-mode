 "text": "In Salah or AÃ¯n Salah (Arabic: ) is a town in southern Algeria, located in the Sahara desert, about away from the capital city, Algiers. The town has more than 22,000 people living there. It was founded in the 17th century and used to be a trade center for the Tuareg people who moved around. It was an important stopover for caravans carrying goods like salt, gold, and slaves. In Salah became part of France when they colonized Algeria. After Algeria gained independence, In Salah became part of Tamanrasset Province. In January 2015, people protested against a proposed shale gas drilling project because they were concerned about the environment and earthquakes. In Salah is in the middle of the Sahara desert and is surrounded by sand dunes and rocks. The nearest city is Tamanrasset. The town has a hot desert climate, with extremely hot summers and mild winters. It rarely rains in In Salah. == References == Category:Towns in Algeria",
