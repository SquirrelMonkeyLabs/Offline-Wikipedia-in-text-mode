Three games were played here for the tournament. During Euro2008, the real grass inside the stadium was replaced with fake grass, which is called artificial turf. The stadium's operators removed the artificial turf after the championship. == The hot seat == All the seats are either black or yellow, but there is one red seat in sector A. It is called the \"hot seat\". The ticket for that seat is often given to former players of Young Boys or famous visitors. The first person who sat in the \"hot seat\" was the most successful goalkeeper of the BSC Young Boys, Walter Eirich. == References == == Other websites == *The official website of the Stade de Suisse Category:Football stadiums in Switzerland Category:Bern Category:2005 establishments in Europe Category:2000s establishments in Switzerland",
