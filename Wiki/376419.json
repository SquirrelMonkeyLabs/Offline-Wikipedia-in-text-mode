 "text": "A slogan is a memorable motto or phrase. It is often used in a political, commercial, religious, and other context as a repetitive expression of an idea or purpose. The word slogan is derived from slogorn which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic sluagh-ghairm tanmay (sluagh \"army\", \"host\" + gairm \"cry\")Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 1174. meaning something an army chanted while fighting, to keep them all cooperating. Slogans vary from the written and the visual to the chanted and the vulgar. Their simple rhetorical nature usually leaves little room for detail. Marketing slogans are often called taglines in the United States. They can be called straplines in the U.K. Europeans use the terms baselines, signatures, claims, or pay-offs. ==References== Category:Phrases",
