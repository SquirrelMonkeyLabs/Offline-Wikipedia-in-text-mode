 "text": "The Thunder Bay Thunder Cats was the name of the Rockford IceHogs of the UHL (now the International Hockey League) prior to moving to Rockford. The team went through a number of different names prior to being the Thunder Cats, including the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks and the Thunder Bay Senators. ==History== After the success of the 5-time Allan Cup champion Thunder Bay Twins, the Colonial Hockey League took interest in expanding to the Northwestern Ontario city. In 1991, the Colonial league introduced the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks, spelling the end of the 21-year Twins franchise that stepped aside for the new Semi-Pro team. In 1993, the team changed its name to the Thunder Bay Senators to reflect the teams affiliation with the National Hockey League's Ottawa Senators. Soon after, the CoHL changed its name to the United Hockey League and in 1996 the team became the Thunder Bay Thunder Cats. After eight seasons in Thunder Bay, the Thunder Cats were bought, moved to Rockford, Illinois, and renamed the Rockford IceHogs in 1999. ==Season-by- Season results== Season GP W L T OTL GF GA Pts Final standing Playoffs 1991–92 60 26 28 6 — 309 289 62 3rd CoHL Won Championship 1992–93 60 32 24 4 — 288 271 68 3rd CoHL Lost semi-final 1993–94 64 45 15 4 — 331 236 94 1st CoHL Won Championship 1994–95 74 48 22 4 — 341 279 100 1st CoHL Won Championship 1995–96 74 36 26 12 — 302 289 84 4th CoHL Lost Championship 1996–97 74 43 23 8 — 333 266 94 4th CoHL Lost semi-final 1997–98 74 42 26 0 6 337 304 90 4th UHL Lost quarter-final 1998–99 74 47 20 0 7 325 247 101 3rd UHL Lost semi-final ==References== *International Hockey League History Category:Ice hockey teams in Ontario Category:Thunder Bay",
