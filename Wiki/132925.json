 "text": "Martin Heidegger (26 September 1889 – 26 May 1976) was a German philosopher. His best known book, Being and Time, is considered one of the most important philosophical works of the 20th century.Heidegger, Martin 2008. Being and time. New York: HarperCollins. Lackey, Douglas. 1999. What are the modern classics? The Baruch poll of great philosophy in the twentieth century. Philosophical Forum. 30 (4): 329-46 It is a very difficult book, even for the German reader. ==Works== In it, and later works, Heidegger maintained that our way of questioning defines our nature. But philosophy, western civilization's chief way of questioning, has lost its way. Finding ourselves \"always already\" fallen in a world of presuppositions, we lose touch with what being was before its truth became \"muddled\".Heidegger, Martin. 2001. Poetry, language, thought. New York: HarperCollins. As a solution to this condition, Heidegger advocated a return to practical life in the world, allowing it to reveal, or \"unconceal\" itself. == References == Category:1889 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century German philosophers Category:German academics Category:19th-century German philosophers Category:Nazis Category:People from Baden-Württemberg",
