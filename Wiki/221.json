 "text": "Et cetera means \"and the rest\" in Latin. It is often used in English to continue a list longer than what can be written. The word et cetera is often written as etc.. Rarely, it is written as &c;, or &. It is the same as et â€’ formed by the joining of \"e\" and \"t\" into a single letter. It is also the symbol for \"and\". Some write it as ect, which is wrong, because it is an incorrect abbreviation of et cetera. ==Examples== * \"Jane has a lot of pets. She has cats, dogs, cows, horses, rabbits, kangaroos, etc.\" * \"Rocco ordered a lot of chips. He ordered cheese puffs, potato chips, Pringles, etc.\" * \"Robert ordered a large amount of groceries to stock for later. He ordered eggs, carrots, tomatoes, potatoes etc.\" Category:Latin phrases",
