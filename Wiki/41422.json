 "text": "Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe (23 June 1940 â€“ 10 April 1962) was an early member of the English band The Beatles. He was born in Edinburgh, Scotland and raised in Liverpool, England. He was the band's original bassist, but left before they became famous. He wanted to be an artist, and he returned to art school, which he had quit to join the Beatles. Sutcliffe died in 1962, at the age of 21, in Hamburg, Germany from a brain hemorrhage. It was long thought that the hemorrhage was from a fight with locals after a concert in 1961, but it is now believed he may have been born with a medical condition which caused it.
