 "text": "Ronald Vernie \"Ron\" Dellums (November 24, 1935 - July 30, 2018) was an American politician. He was Oakland's forty-eighth mayor. From 1971 to 1998, he was elected to thirteen terms as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Northern California's 9th Congressional District. When President Ronald Reagan vetoed Dellums' Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate overrode Reagan's veto, the first override of a presidential foreign policy veto in the 20th century. Dellums died on July 30, 2018 in Washington, D.C. from prostate cancer, aged 82. ==References== ==Other websites== *Profile at Citymayors.com * *Dellums victory signifies a sea change in Oakland politics San Francisco Chronicle, June 19, 2006. *Ron Dellums's oral history video excerpts at The National Visionary Leadership Project.
