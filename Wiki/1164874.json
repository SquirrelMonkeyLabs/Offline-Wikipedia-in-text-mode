By 2010, the school had an 82% Muslim enrollment, as a result of the exodus of Christians from Iraq. The church was attacked twice in the year prior to the kidnapping; the Father was shot during one of the attacks. == Kidnapping in 2006 == Father Douglas was abducted in November 2006 by an Islamist group. He was tortured and cut to pieces, and was released nine days later. A bullet remains in his leg. == References == Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:Roman Catholic priests Category:People from Baghdad",
