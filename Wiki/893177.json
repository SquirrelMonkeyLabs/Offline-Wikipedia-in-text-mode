Aidid later led the Somali National Alliance (SNA). He was a part of the groups that overthrew and exiled President Mohamed Siad Barre's socialist and communist government from Somalia during the Somali Civil War in the early 1990s. In 1992, Aidid attacked United Nations troops. This caused him to be named the world’s first Wanted Man of the Unified Task Force. After UN peacekeepers withdrew in 1993, 19 American soldiers were killed by Aidid's forces. They also attacked peacekeepers, caused violence and committed crimes against humanity. On 1 August 1996, Aidid suffered a heart attack after being wounded. He died at the age of 61. Early live ==References== Category:1934 births Category:1996 deaths category:Somali people",
