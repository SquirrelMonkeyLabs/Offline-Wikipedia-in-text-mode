 "text": "Wiener FC 1898 (Vienna Football Club 1898) was one of the first football clubs in Austrias capital Vienna. The club existed from 1897 till 1903. ==History== The club was the football section of the Deutsch-Österreichischen Turnverein Wien (German-Austrian gymnastic club). The Turnverein was founded by Jewish members of the Ersten Wiener Turnverein 1861 (First Vienna gymnastic club). In the 1880s the club allowed only members of German origin to be members. So did other sports clubs. The Jewish members formed the Deutsch-Österreichischen Turnverein. In 1898 the football section became a club of its own. In the first year they reached the final of the Challenge-Cup, a football competition for clubs from the Austrian- Hungary Empire. They lost 7-0 to Vienna Cricket and Football-Club. In the next editions the club reached the semi finals. In 1900/01 the Österreichischen Fußball-Union organized a league and Wiener FC was put in the 1. Klasse. They played for the Tagblatt-Pokal (Tagblatt-Cup, \"Tagblatt\" was a newspaper from Vienna) The reason for quitting the league was that the club suffered often from a lack of players. ==Honours== * Challenge- Cup-Final: 1898 * Challenge-Cup-semi finals: 1899, 1900, 1903 ==Notable player== *Julius Wiesner 1 international match 1902 Category:Austrian football clubs Category:Football clubs of Vienna",
