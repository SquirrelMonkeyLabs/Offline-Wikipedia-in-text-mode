 "text": "Electrology is an electrical process to remove human hair so that it does not grow back. An electrologist is sometimes called an electrolysist in the United Kingdom. The process of removing the hair is referred to as electrolysis. The electrolysist slides a thin metal probe into each hair follicle. This, if done the right way, does not hurt the skin. Electricity flows to the follicle through the probe. This causes damage to the areas that grow hair so that it does not grow back. ==Other websites== * American Electrology Association * British Institute and Association of Electrolysis * The Society for Clinical & Medical Hair Removal, Inc. * International Guild of Hair Removal Specialists, Inc. * HairFacts - electrolysis medical data * HairTell - Electrolysis Discussion * Electrolysis discussion group Category:Hair Category:Medical procedures",
