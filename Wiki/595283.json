 "text": "Tigrinya (sometimes written asTigrigna; ;Laurie Bauer, 2007, The Linguistics Student's Handbook, Edinburgh ) is an Afroasiatic language of the Ethiopian Semitic branch. It is mostly spoken in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. There are approximately 6,915,000 total speakers of this language. There are approximately 4,320,000 in Ethiopia and approximately 2,540,000 in Eritrea. Tigrinya is also spoken by emigrants from these regions, including some Ethiopian Jews. == History and literature == The earliest written example of Tigrinya is a text of local laws found in Logosarda district, Southern Region, Eritrea. It is from the 13th century. Tigrinya is related to the Ethiopian Semitic language Ge'ez. However, Tigrinya has a different word order than Ge'ez, and there are some more differences in grammar. However, the two languages have similar phonology and morphology, which show they are related.Fellman, J. (2005). Lines on an African-Semitic language: The case of Tigrinya. Folia Linguistica, 26(1/2), 163-164. doi:10.1515/flin.26.1-2.163 Ge'ez has influenced Tigrinya literature, especially with words about Christian life.The Bible in Tigrigna, United Bible society, 1997 Until recent times, Ge'ez was used for writing more often than Tigrinya was.Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians, Oxford University Press 1960 When the British ruled Eritrea, there was a newspaper written in Tigrinya.Ministry of Information (1944) The First to be Freed—The record of British military administration in Eritrea and Somalia, 1941-1943. London: His Majesty's Stationery Office. Tigrinya was one of Eritrea's official languages while it was part of Ethiopia; in 1958 it was replaced with the language Amharic. During the rule of Emperor Haile Selassie (1930-1974), publications in Tigrinya were banned.Woldemariam, H., & Lanza, E. (2014). Language contact, agency and power in the linguistic landscape of two regional capitals of Ethiopia. International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 228, 79-103. When Selassie lost power, Amharic remained the standard language. In 1991, Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia. Tigrinya was the \"working language\" in Eritrea. == Speakers == There are 6,915,000 total Tigrinya speakers. Of these, approximately 4,320,000 live in Ethiopia. Most Tigrinya speakers in Ethiopia live in the Tigray region. There are approximately 2,540,000 Tigrinya speakers in Eritrea. Most of these live in the southern and central areas of the country. There are also over 10,000 Beta Israel speakers of Tigrinya. Tigrinya is the fourth most spoken language in Ethiopia after Amharic, Oromo, Somali and the most widely spoken language in Eritrea. It is also spoken by immigrants around the world. In Australia, Tigrinya is broadcast on public radio on the Special Broadcasting Service. There are two dialects of Tigrinya: Northern and Southern.Leslau, Wolf (1941) Documents Tigrigna (Éthiopien Septentrional): Grammaire et Textes. Paris: Librairie C. Klincksieck. Northern Dialect * Eritrea (Hamasien, Seraye, Akele Guzay, Anseba) * Ethiopia (Adwa, Axum, Shire, most areas of Agame) Southern Dialect * Ethiopia (Enderta, Tembien, Raya, some areas of Agame) == Phonology == Tigrinya has a set of ejective consonants and seven vowels. A Tigrinya syllable may have a consonant-vowel or a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence. == Writing system == Tigrinya is written in the Ge'ez script (Ethiopic script), which was originally developed for the Ge'ez language. The Ge'ez script is an abugida. Each symbol represents a consonant+vowel syllable.Rehman, Abdel. English Tigrigna Dictionary: A Dictionary of the Tigrinya Language: (Asmara) Simon Wallenberg Press.
