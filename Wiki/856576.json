 "text": "East Jerusalem (Hebrew: מזרח ירושלים, Mizraḥ Yerushalayim; , al-Quds ash- Sharqiya) is the eastern part of Jerusalem that was occupied and then annexed by Jordan after the 1947–1949 Palestine war. Israel got control of it, along with the West Bank, after the Six-Day War. The Palestinian National Authority claims East Jerusalem as it's capital city, however, all of Jerusalem is still under Israel's control. The Old City of Jerusalem is in East Jerusalem. Many of the most famous and most important landmarks for Jews, Muslims, and Christians are in the Old City. Category:Neighbourhoods of Jerusalem Category:Cities in the West Bank",
