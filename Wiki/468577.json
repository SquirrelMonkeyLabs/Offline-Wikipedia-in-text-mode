 "text": "The Yarra River is also known as the Yarra Yarra River, Aboriginal: Berrern, Birr-arrung, Bay-ray-rung, Birarang. Birrarung, and Wongete). The Yarra River is a perennial river in east-central Victoria, Australia. The river flows from its source in the Yarra Ranges west through the Yarra Valley. The river opens out into plains as it winds its way through Greater Melbourne. It then empties into Hobsons Bay in northernmost Port Phillip. The river was a major food source for indigenous Australians during prehistoric times. It also served as a meeting place during those times. The river was first called Birrarung by the Wurundjeri. The current name was translated wrong from another Wurundjeri term in the Boonwurrung language; Yarro-yarro, meaning \"ever-flowing\". The river was used for agriculture by early European settlers. The landscape of the river has changed since 1835. The course of the river has been changed and widened in places. Widening and dams, like the Upper Yarra Reservoir have helped protect Melbourne from major flooding. Industrialisation led to the destruction of the marshlands at the joining of the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers in the area around Coode Island in West Melbourne. The yearly Moomba festival celebrates the Yarra River's meaning to Melbourne. ==References== ==Other websites== *The Yarra River Category:Rivers of Victoria (Australia)",
