 "text": "The Rockwell B-1 Lancer is a strategic bomber in the service with the US Air Force. It is a four-turbojet aircraft that uses a variable-sweep wing. It can carry guided bombs or classic bombs. It used to be able to carry nuclear weapons, however due to treaties between the US and Soviet Union, this is no longer. It is only used by the USA. Originally designed in the 1970s to replace the older Boeing B-52 Stratofortress as the B-1A. Program was cancelled in 1977. When Ronald Reagan was elected in the United States, the program was reconsidered and the B-1B was developed, an improved variant. The new B-1B entered service on 1 October 1986. When Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty I or START I, a treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, went effective, the US Air Force got rid of the B-1's nuclear mission. This was done by removing the ways it used to be able to carry nuclear weapons and limiting its bomb load. == Variants == * Rockwell B-1A : Four examples, only used as prototype and test planes. * Rockwell B-1B : One hundred examples, used as bombers. == Similar aircraft == * Tupolev Tu-160 ==References== == Bibliography == * * Category:United States Air Force aircraft",
