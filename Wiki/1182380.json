 "text": "The 99 Movement (Hungarian: 99 Mozgalom) was a cross-party political movement in Hungary, announced on May 15, 2021, by Gergely Karácsony, the mayor of Budapest. The 99 Movement was started to help Gergely Karácsony win the 2021 Hungarian opposition primary and then, as the opposition coalition’s candidate for prime minister, the 2022 Hungarian parliamentary election. He stressed that he wants a country where no one labels others as traitors, and where people don’t have to pick between loving their country and wanting progress, between being Hungarian and supporting Europe, or between Budapest and the countryside. The movement has now completely disappeared and its website has also been removed. == References == Category:Defunct political parties in Hungary",
