 "text": "The silver-eyed shrub frog (Raorchestes vellikkannan) is a species of frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains in the state of Kerala. Scientists do not know much about this frog. People have seen it 856 meters above sea level, north of the Palghat Gap. Scientists think this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole. They think this because that is what other frogs in Raorchestes do. ==References== Category:Frogs of Asia",
