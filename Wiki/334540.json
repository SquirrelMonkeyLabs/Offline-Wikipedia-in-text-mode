 "text": "Color of Night is a 1994 American erotic mystery thriller movie. It was released on August 19, 1994. It is directed by Richard Rush. It stars Bruce Willis, Jane March and Scott Bakula. Color of Night gained notoriety for sex scenes between Willis and March, which were somewhat graphic and explicit by mainstream standards. The character Rose (played by March) is a bisexual woman. The scenes led the MPAA to give Color of Night an NC-17 rating; certain scenes were then removed before release. Color of Night is rated R for sexual content, graphic violence and very strong language. Maxim magazine has singled out the movie as having the best sex scene in movie history. ==References== == Other websites == * Category:1994 crime thriller movies Category:1990s erotic movies Category:1994 LGBT movies Category:1994 mystery movies Category:American crime thriller movies Category:American erotic movies Category:American LGBT movies Category:American mystery movies Category:1990s English-language movies Category:Mental disorders in fiction Category:Movies set in Los Angeles Category:Movies set in New York City Category:American independent movies",
