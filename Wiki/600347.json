 "text": "The Vettabbia Canal, known in Italian as the Naviglio Vettabbia, is a canal in the southern part of Milan, a city in northern Italy. The ancient Romans built the canal to bring water to the city. Today farmers use it to irrigate their crops. Part of the canal is now underground. There are two large parks along the banks of the canal where it comes above the ground. One park is called the Parco della Vettabbia. Near the park is a famous abbey called the Abbazia di Chiaravalle. The abbey was built in the 12th century. The other park is called the Parco Ripamonti.Borasio, Mariella and Prusicki, Marco (2014). \"Milan rural metropolis: A project for the enhancement of waters towards the neo- ruralisation of territorial system in Milan\".
