The single was produced by Butch Walker, who produced the majority of the band's Vices & Virtues album, and written by frontman Brendon Urie and percussionist Spencer Smith along with co-producer John Feldmann.

Odd. The single peaked at number fourteen on the U.S. Billboard Alternative Songs chart in July of 2011. The song was chosen as the opening act for the band's headlining Vices & Virtues U.S. Tour in 2011 duo to its rev-up sound and pop elements. ==Music video== The single's music video premiered on YouTube and VEVO on May 2, 2011 on the official Fueled By Ramen YouTube channel.
