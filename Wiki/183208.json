 "text": "A browser game is a video game that is played on a web browser. It is different from other video games in that it usually does not need any other software to be installed on the user's computer. Most games use technologies built into the web browser, such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly, with plugins, like Flash Player and Java, being more popular until the mid-2010s. Some games also need to run code on servers (meaning they do not run on the user's computer), often massively multiplayer online games. == References ==",
