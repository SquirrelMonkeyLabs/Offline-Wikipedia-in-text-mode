 "text": "The Turimiquire collared frog (Mannophryne leonardoi) is a frog. It lives in the Macizo del Turimiquire in northeastern Venezuela. ==Body== The adult female frog is 22.0-24.2 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult male frog is 19.5- 20.7 mm long. The male frog has yellow color on its chest and neck and the adult female frog has gray color on its chest and neck. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams on mountains. When the weather is rainy and there is water in the air, the frog can go far from the stream. This is when the frogs move from one stream to other streams. Scientists saw the frog between 156 and 1650 meters above sea level. There are two protected places where the frog lives: Mochima National Park and Cueva del Gu√°charo National Park. Most of the rest of the place where the frog lives is in the Macizo de Turmiquire Protective Zone of Rivers, but this is not as protected as the national parks are. ==Young== The male frogs sit on rocks next to streams and call to the female frogs during the day. Scientists think the frog has young the same way as other frogs in Mannophryne: The female frog lays eggs near streams, and, after the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Human beings change the places where it lives to make farms and places to raise animals. Human beings move streams to get water for farms. Bad chemicals from farms can also hurt this frog. Dams for electricity can also change the place where the frog lives. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America Category:Poison dart frogs",
