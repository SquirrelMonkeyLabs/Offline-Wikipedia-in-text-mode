 "text": "The Cook Partisan Voting Index is the unit used to calculate how much a particular state or congressional district leans towards each political party. == By state == All 50 states in the United States lean either towards the Democrats or Republicans. The most Democratic-leaning state, according to the CPVI, is Vermont, which is D+16 on the CPVI scale (meaning that, in a normal election, the Democratic candidate should start with an advantage of approximately 31 points over the Republican candidate there). On the other hand, the most Republican-leaning state, Wyoming, has a CPVI score of R+25, meaning that the Democrat will have a 51% edge against their Republican opponent in a neutral election.
