 "text": "The President of the European Council is a position that was created by the Treaty of Lisbon. The President is the chairman of the European Council, which is the meeting of the leaders of all the member states. ==Background== It's a very diplomatic figure, and it's not like a head of state: the President does not have any power to make decisions about the European Union. The Union has several other presidents, such as the president of the European Parliament and the president of the European Commission. But the President of the European Council, casually but wrongly known as The President of Europe, is the face by which the European Union is known to the rest of the world. The more practical aspects of this task are the responsibility of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Commissioner responsible for external affairs. ==List of president== ===Rotating presidents (1975–2009)=== Year Period Office Holder European party European party State 1975 Jan–Jun Liam Cosgrave European People's Party 1975 Jul–Dec Aldo Moro European People's Party 1976 Jan–Jun Gaston Thorn Liberal and Democratic Group 1976 Jul–Dec Joop den Uyl Party of European Socialists 1977 Jan–Jun James Callaghan Party of European Socialists 1977 Jul–Dec Leo Tindemans European People's Party 1978 Jan–Jun Anker Jørgensen Party of European Socialists 1978 Jul–Dec Helmut Schmidt Party of European Socialists 1979 Jan–Jun Valéry Giscard d'Estaing European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party 1979 Jul–Dec Jack Lynch European Progressive Democrats 1979 Dec Charles Haughey European Progressive Democrats 1980 Jan–Jun Francesco Cossiga European People's Party 1980 Jul–Dec Pierre Werner European People's Party 1981 Jan–Jun Dries van Agt European People's Party 1981 Jul–Dec Margaret Thatcher Independent 1982 Jan–Jun Wilfried Martens European People's Party 1982 Jul–Sep Anker Jørgensen Party of European Socialists 1982 Sep–Dec Poul Schlüter European People's Party 1983 Jan–Jun Helmut Kohl European People's Party 1983 Jul–Dec Andreas Papandreou Party of European Socialists 1984 Jan–Jun François Mitterrand Party of European Socialists 1984 Jul–Dec Garret FitzGerald European People's Party 1985 Jan–Jun Bettino Craxi Party of European Socialists 1985 Jul–Dec Jacques Santer European People's Party 1986 Jan–Jun Ruud Lubbers European People's Party 1986 Jul–Dec Margaret Thatcher Independent 1987 Jan–Jun Wilfried Martens European People's Party 1987 Jul–Dec Poul Schlüter European People's Party 1988 Jan–Jun Helmut Kohl European People's Party 1988 Jul–Dec Andreas Papandreou Party of European Socialists 1989 Jan–Jun Felipe González Party of European Socialists 1989 Jul–Dec François Mitterrand Party of European Socialists 1990 Jan–Jun Charles Haughey European Democratic Alliance 1990 Jul–Dec Giulio Andreotti European People's Party 1991 Jan–Jun Jacques Santer European People's Party 1991 Jul–Dec Ruud Lubbers European People's Party 1992 Jan–Jun Aníbal Cavaco Silva European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party 1992 Jul–Dec John Major Independent 1993 Jan Poul Schlüter European People's Party 1993 Jan–Jun Poul Nyrup Rasmussen Party of European Socialists 1993 Jul–Dec Jean-Luc Dehaene European People's Party 1994 Jan–Jun Andreas Papandreou Party of European Socialists 1994 Jul–Dec Helmut Kohl European People's Party 1995 Jan–May François Mitterrand Party of European Socialists 1995 May–Jun Jacques Chirac Independent 1995 Jul–Dec Felipe González Party of European Socialists 1996 Jan–May Lamberto Dini European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party 1996 May–Jun Romano Prodi Party of European Socialists 1996 Jul–Dec John Bruton European People's Party 1997 Jan–Jun Wim Kok Party of European Socialists 1997 Jul–Dec Jean-Claude Juncker European People's Party 1998 Jan–Jun Tony Blair Party of European Socialists 1998 Jul–Dec Viktor Klima Party of European Socialists 1999 Jan–Jun Gerhard Schröder Party of European Socialists 1999 Jul–Dec Paavo Lipponen Party of European Socialists 2000 Jan–Jun António Guterres Party of European Socialists 2000 Jul–Dec Jacques Chirac European People's Party 2001 Jan–Jun Göran Persson Party of European Socialists 2001 Jul–Dec Guy Verhofstadt European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party 2002 Jan–Jun José María Aznar European People's Party 2002 Jul–Dec Anders Fogh Rasmussen European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party 2003 Jan–Jun Costas Simitis Party of European Socialists 2003 Jul–Dec Silvio Berlusconi European People's Party 2004 Jan–Jun Bertie Ahern Union for Europe of the Nations 2004 Jul–Dec Jan Peter Balkenende European People's Party 2005 Jan–Jun Jean-Claude Juncker European People's Party 2005 Jul–Dec Tony Blair Party of European Socialists 2006 Jan–Jun Wolfgang Schüssel European People's Party 2006 Jul–Dec Matti Vanhanen European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party 2007 Jan–Jun Angela Merkel European People's Party 2007 Jul–Dec José Sócrates Party of European Socialists 2008 Jan–Jun Janez Janša European People's Party 2008 Jul–Dec Nicolas Sarkozy European People's Party 2009 Jan–May Mirek Topolánek Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists 2009 May–Jun Jan Fischer Independent 2009 Jul–Nov Fredrik Reinfeldt European People's Party ===Permanent presidents (since 2009)=== N.
