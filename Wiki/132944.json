 "text": "Ronald David Laing (7 October 1927, Glasgow Scotland - 23 August 1989), was a Scottish psychiatrist who described mental illness, especially psychosis. Laing is known for his theories on the causes of the mental perturbations. His theory on the \"schizogenous\" (?) parents or schizophrenia was to exclude him from the psychiatric orthodoxy of his times. He often was connected in thought with the movement against psychiatry called antipsychiatry, although he rejected that epithet. ==Writings (selection)== * 1960 - Laing, R.D.: The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness.
