 "text": "A laundromat, laundrette, self-service laundry, coin laundry, or coin-wash is a business where people can wash their own clothes. ==Use== While most homes have their own washers and dryers, laundromats are still very popular with people who live in apartments and those who do not have their own machines. They are also used, even by those who have their own machines, for large bedding and other items that normal house washers cannot fit. Some UK households have bedding (such as duvets and comforters) that are much too big to fit inside of home washing machines, and UK households may not have dryers, making laundromats the only way available for cleaning them or drying them. ==References== Category:Business",
