The city is at the confluence of the Alzette and Pétrusse rivers in southern Luxembourg. In the city is found the Luxembourg Castle, built by the Franks in the Early Middle Ages, around which a settlement developed. ==History== During the Roman period, two main roads crossed the territory of the present city of Luxembourg; these two roads met at the place Marché-aux-Poissons (now a street and a neighborhood) dominated by a fortified tower. A castle was built here called Lucilinburhuc (\"small castle\"). In 963, this place became a property of Siegfried I, a close relative of the Emperors of Germany and Kings of France. Siegfried built a castle, not far from the \"Lucilinburhuc\" castle, on a rocky cliff called the Bock (). This place is now considered the birthplace of the city, the country and the nation. In 1994 UNESCO named the Old Quarters and Fortifications a World Heritage Site. ==Geography== The city of Luxembourg has an area of , about 2% of the territory of the whole country.
