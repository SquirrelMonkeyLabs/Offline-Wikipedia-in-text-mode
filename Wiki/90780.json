 "text": "St. Thomas Aquinas, (1225 – 7 March 1274) was a Catholic Dominican priest from Italy, saint and philosopher. He was born in Roccasecca, as the son of Count Andulf of Aquino and Countess Theodora of Teano. His early education was at the Benedictine monastery at Montecassino. He attended the University of Naples, where he got the nickname \"dumb ox\" for his slow demeanor, though he was an intelligent and talented student. He studied philosophy, Catholic theology, church history, liturgy, and canon law. Thomas de Aquinas is an essential character of Western philosophy and Christianity. We have access to his academic work, teachings, and writings approaching abstract thinking. Thomas de Aquinas began his journey with the monastery (religious life) at five years old. Coming from a wealthy and influential family, Thomas de Aquinas was destined by his family to become the Abbot of Montecassino. He didn't want to follow the path his family had paved for him and decided to become a monk with the Dominicans. They were monks who lived by eliminating all material wealth. For his family, being a monk of the Dominicans was a dishonor. His family kidnapped him and kept him prisoner in the their castle for over a year in an attempt to change his mind. This was until he escaped and became a friar with the new Dominican Order against the wishes of his family. He was sent to Paris by the Dominicans to study theology and philosophy. He became one of the 33 Doctors of the Church and is known for his work with Natural Law. Aquinas took an optimistic view of human nature, believing that it is human nature to do good and not evil. He was the author of the cosmological argument. Catholics think Aquinas is the best teacher for one who wants to become a priest.Code of Canon Law, Can. 252, §3 His most famous book being Summa Theologica. Many schools are named after him including the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Manila, Philippines. == References == Category:Doctors of the Church Category:1225 births Category:1274 deaths Category:People from Lazio",
