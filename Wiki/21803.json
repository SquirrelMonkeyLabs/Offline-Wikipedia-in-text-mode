 "text": "The shiitake mushroom, or simply called \"shiitake\"(椎茸) (Lentinus edodes or Lentinula edodes) is also known as Chinese black mushroom or black forest mushroom. It is also called \"black mushroom\". It is an edible mushroom, which is typically grown on the tree, such as shii, kunugi and oak. There are two variant names. For high grades of shiitake is dōnggū (冬茹: どんこ) (\"winter mushroom\"). And another is huāgū (\"flower mushroom,\" (香信: こうしん) which has a flower-like cracking pattern on the mushroom's upper surface). Both are produced at colder temperatures. There are many cultivated varieties, which grow-up in a temperature at 7C - 26C, most cultivars like cooler temperatures. == Notes == Category:Edible fungi Category:Mushrooms",
