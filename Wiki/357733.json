The current coat of arms is only slightly different from that used when Belize was a British colony.National arms of BELIZE - Heraldry of the World. Retrieved 10 March 2012. The border is a circle of twenty-five leaves. Inside the circle is a mahogany tree. There are the tools of a woodcutter and a ship. These show the importance of mahogany in the 18th and 19th century Belizean economy. The shield is supported by two wood-cutters of different races. The one on the left is holding an axe. The one on the right is holding an oar. Again this shows the importance of the mahogany and its importance to boat building. At the bottom is the national motto: SUB UMBRA FLOREO. This means \"Under the Shade I Flourish\". The Flag of Belize has the coat of arms in its centre. ==References== Belize Category:National symbols of Belize",
