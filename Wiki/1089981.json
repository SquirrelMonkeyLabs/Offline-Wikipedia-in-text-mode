 "text": "Tweed Heads is a coastal city in New South Wales. It is located at the mouth of the Tweed River in the Northern Rivers region. It is the seat of the Tweed Shire Council. Tweed Heads is located on the border between New South Wales and Queensland. Just north of Tweed Heads on the other side of the border is the suburb of Coolangatta on the Gold Coast. Tweed Heads is often considered a place where people can change time zones. This is because between October and April, New South Wales has daylight savings, but Queensland does not, which means Queensland is one hour behind New South Wales during those months. People often go to Tweed Heads on New Year's Eve because they can celebrate twice by simply crossing a street. ==References== Category:Cities in New South Wales",
