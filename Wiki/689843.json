 "text": "Ian Cognito (born Paul Barbieri, 21 November 1958 - 11 April 2019) was an English stand-up comedian. Many said his comedy was like Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, and Jerry Sadowitz but had no presence in the mainstream media because of his ill-tempered persona. Cognito won the Time Out Award for Stand-up Comedy in 1999. Cognito died on 11 April 2019 of a heart attack during a comedy gig in Bicester. He was 60. ==References== ==Other websites== * Official website * Official website (pre-minimalist version) archived at the Wayback Machine * Review in The Guardian * Chortle review Category:1958 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Comedians from London Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction",
