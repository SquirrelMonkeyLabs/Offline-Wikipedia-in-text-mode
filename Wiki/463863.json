He turned to radical pacifism and opposed all forms of warfare and aggression. This is why he declined the Crafoord Prize in 1988. In 1966 he was awarded the Fields Medal.Sooyoung Chang, Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians (Hackensack, NJ; Singapore: World Scientific, 2011), p. 115 ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Fields Medalists Category:Scientists from Berlin Category:French algebraic geometers",
