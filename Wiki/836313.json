 "text": "The Maibam Lokpa Ching or the Maibam Lotpa Ching or the Red Hills is a historic war memorial site of the Battle of Imphal, an important branch of the WWII, that took place in Nambol, Manipur. The site is a small hillock where the battle was fought between the British Army and the Japanese Troops. Due to the heavy casualties in the Japan side, the entire landscape of the hillock was dyed red with the bloods of the dead soldiers. Thus, the place is popularly known as the \"Red Hills\" of WWII. Presently, a war cemetery is developed by the Japanese Government and Imphal Peace Museum, a museum housing relics from the event, is also developed. ==Other websites== * https://www.imphaltimes.com/news/item/16282-japan-s-pm-proposed-visit-at- maibam-lotpa-ching-postponed * http://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=9..141219.dec19 * http://www.manipur.org/news/2019/09/27/world-tourism-day-held-at-maibam-lotpa- ching/ * http://www.manipurtourismforum.com/news-a-events/item/38-71st- anniversary-of-battle-of-imphal-at-lotpa-ching-commemoration-successful.html * http://www.uniindia.com/manipur-prepares-for-visit-of-japanese-pm- abe/east/news/1813850.html == References == Category:History of Manipur Category:Japanese-Meitei culture",
