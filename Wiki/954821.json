 "text": "The Phyllodytes edelmoi is a frog. It lives in Brazil in the state of Alagoas. People have seen it as high as 650 meters above sea level. This frog lives in forests and rocky places. It lives on cliffs and mountains. Scientists have seen it in plants that grow on the ground and plants that grow on trees. The female frog lays eggs in the small pools of water that sit in the leaves of the plants. The tadpoles hatch and swim in these pools. Scientists think it might also live in bromeliad plants in people's gardens but they haven't seen them there yet. This frog is not in danger of dying out. Scientists say this is because it is good at living in places that humans have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
