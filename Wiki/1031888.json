 "text": "Barbenheimer is an Internet phenomenon and internet meme that began before the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer, on July 21, 2023. The word is a portmanteau of the movies' titles. The reason why this meme happened is because Barbie, a fantasy comedy movie based on the fashion doll Barbie, and Oppenheimer, a biographical thriller movie about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, caused a comedic response because they were being released on the same date. Polygon described the two movies as extremely opposite to each other. The meme gained popularity with several movie theatres selling both movies as double features. Actor Tom Cruise, Barbie director Greta Gerwig and actress Margot Robbie took part of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon and watched both movies. In an interview, Oppenheimer actor Cillian Murphy supported the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\" Many critics were surprised by how \"Barbenheimer\" was helping the release of both movies being release on the same day, whereas normally when two major movies were being released on the same day, they would compete at the box office. Barbie made $22.3 million in Thursday night previews, while Oppenheimer made $10.5 million. This was the first time two movies have made more than $10 million each in their previews in 2023. The movies earned a combined 21 nominations at the 96th Academy Awards, both movies nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, with Oppenheimer receiving the most of the year at 13. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Internet memes Category:July 2023 events Category:Comparisons",
