 "text": "Naan bread is a type of bread made with flour. It is a flatbread that is baked in a tandoor. Naan bread often looks like a tear drop. It is often covered in herbs and spices such as garlic to change the taste. Naan bread is made from basic bread ingredients like wheat flour, a leavening agent (either yeast, yogurt, baking powder, or all), salt, and butter or ghee. It also is made with yogurt and milk. The yogurt is what makes naan bread taste so much different than other kinds of bread. == Gallery == File:Cheese Naan.jpg|Indian cheese Naan File:Naan shiva.jpg|Naan bread in Indian restaurant Shiva. == Related pages == * Bread Category:Indian food Category:Flatbreads Category:Afghan food Category:Bangladeshi food Category:Pakistani food Category:Indonesian food Category:Persian food Category:Burmese food Category:Kurdish food",
