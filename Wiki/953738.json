 "text": "Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin (; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian political philosopher, analyst, and strategist. He has been called a fascist for his ideology.In a 1999 interview for the Polish magazine Fronda, Dugin explains: \"In Russian Orthodox christianity a person is a part of the Church, part of the collective organism, just like a leg. So how can a person be responsible for himself? Can a leg be responsible for itself? Here is where the idea of state, total state originates from. Also because of this, Russians, since they are Orthodox, can be the true fascists, unlike artificial Italian fascists: of Gentile type or their Hegelians. The true Hegelianism is Ivan Peresvetov â€“ the man who in 16th century invented the oprichnina for Ivan the Terrible. He was the true creator of Russian fascism. He created the idea that state is everything and an individual is nothing.\" He is also a well known supporter of Vladimir Putin, although he has no official connections to the Kremlin. He has been called \"Putin's brain\" or \"Putin's Rasputin\" by the media. He is also known for being an important person around Russian's foreign policy.
