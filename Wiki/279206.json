 "text": "The conversion van is a full-sized cargo van. The vans are sent to third party companies and then outfitted with luxuries for road trips and camping. They are available in high topped or in low topped versions, as office vans, travel vans and disability vans. Conversion vans began coming into style during the 1970s and 1980s. Early conversion vans were simply vans which had seats inserted in them. Category:Vans",
