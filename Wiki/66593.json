 "text": "The Northern Ireland Legislative Assembly was set up after the Belfast Agreement to allow the people of Northern Ireland to run their own government and pass some laws. The United Kingdom parliament can still abolish the assembly, because Northern Ireland is not an independent country, but a part of the United Kingdom. The assembly comes together in the city of Belfast. The Speaker is Edwin Poots. The assembly is elected using a form of proportional representation voting.
