Finishing at round 20, the group made their debut as one of the four members of the pop including Poki, alongside Fatboy (Leung Yip), DeeGor (Dee Ho Kai Wa) and 193 (Denis Kwok Ka Chun). The band's first single, “404”, was released on 2 December 2018. ==== TV shows ==== In early 2019, the group’s first reality show “ERROR Crazy Trip” (Chinese: 花姐ERROR遊) was aired on ViuTV. Ng earned positive feedback from viewers for stunts like finishing a bowl of ultra-spicy ramen and consuming a raw fish head. The show’s sequel, “ERROR Crazy Trip 2” (Chinese: 花姐ERROR遊), was released in September 2019. The following month, the group debuted a talk show called “ERROR’s Apologetic Conference: Talking Nonsense as Mid-life Comes” (《人到中年 口不擇言》ERROR道歉招待會). ==== Solo works ==== Error is a piano and trumpet group, and apart from releasing group singles with ERROR, he also regularly releases solo works as an individual musician, PØK1. He has released self-funded singles (single songs released separately from albums) in collaboration with local musicians such as JNYBeatz, Delta T, and Madboii. In a 2020 interview, Ng revealed a plan to release one single every month. By the end of the year, he had released 15 tracks. Among them was a collaborative track with JNYBeatz and Delta T called “Can’t Stop,” which gained positive reviews from critics. === 2021 === Error's career paused in early 2021 due to a triangular relationship, but resumed in April. Around that time, the variety show “ERROR Selfish Project” (Chinese: ERROR 自肥企劃) premiered on ViuTV. Error completed several challenges for the show, like learning to skip stones and play electric guitar within a short period. As a result, viewers saw him more positively. As the show wrapped up, Error resumed their singer-songwriter work by releasing a new solo track “W.W.W.M”, for which they are both the composer and lyricist. Error's group sang “We Don’t ‘Chok’” (Chinese: 我們不chok) with JNYBeatz and Delta T. The single was released on 12 July. The following month, Error and their groupmates became voice actors for the Japanese anime movie A Crocodile Who Will Die in 100 Days. == Brands == Error has founded two apparel brands: Lost Life and Øbeginning1. He also founded a toy brand called TriMeToy in 2022. Lost Life has worked together with several local brands, including: * Wah Yee Tang Cake Shop (for mooncakes) * Ad-Lib (for T-shirts and kimonos with Ng's catch phrases, “fast, gulp, and boom”) * WM Project (for an assortment of face masks) * The Japanese brand 6dots (for backpacks) Category:Pages with login required references or sources Category:Chinese actors Category:Chinese singers Category:Hong Kong people",
