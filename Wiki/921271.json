 "text": "Graham David Scott (born 10 October 1968) is an English professional football referee who officiates in the Premier League. == Career == He studied at Abingdon School from 1980 to 1987 and the London School of Economics. In 2015, he was promoted to the Select Group of Referees, who officiate the matches in the Premier League. He replaced long-time referee Chris Foy. In 2016, former referee Keith Hackett suggested the promotion was \"a mistake\". The PGMOL wanted to demote Scott at the end of the 2016—17 season because he only refereed a few matches. However, Scott appealed against his demotion and retained his place for the 2017—18 season. A number of improved performances has led him to officiate an increased number of matches, with 13 Premier League matches and an EFL League Cup semi-final by the end of January 2018. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:English football referees Category:Sportspeople from Oxfordshire",
