 "text": "The fictional character Spider-Man, a Marvel Comics superhero created in 1962, has appeared in many movies. His first movie appearance was 1977's Spider-Man, the pilot of The Amazing Spider-Man TV series, where he was played by Nicholas Hammond. The movie was followed by two sequels, Spider-Man Strikes Back (1978) and Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge (1981). In 1978, another movie titled Spider-Man was released, as a spin-off of the Japanese Spider-Man TV series, starring Shinji Tōdō. After many canceled movies, the first Hollywood Spider- Man movie was released. Released by Sony, directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, the movie was a big success. Two sequels were released, Spider- Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007). The fourth movie was canceled and Sony released a reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), directed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield. A sequel was released in 2014, but its sequels and spin-offs were canceled as well. After The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Sony made a deal with Marvel Studios to make Spider-Man part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Played by Tom Holland, the character made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016), followed by his own movie, directed by Jon Watts, Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). He returned for Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), before getting two sequels, Spider- Man: Far From Home (2019) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). In No Way Home both Maguire and Garfield returned, along with some villains from their respective movies. While Spider-Man was in the MCU, Sony continued making their own movies. In 2018, they started their own cinematic universe, the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU), consisting of Venom (2018), Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), Morbius (2022), Madame Web (2024), and the upcoming Venom: The Last Dance (2024) and Kraven the Hunter (2024). They also began the Spider-Verse animated movie series, consisting of Spider-Man: Into the Spider- Verse (2018), Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023), and the upcoming Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse (TBA). == Early movies == === The Amazing Spider-Man series === Movie Release date Director Screenwriter Producer(s) Spider-Man E.
