 "text": "The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (shortly called WAIS) is a kind of test that measures how smart adults are. It was made by David Wechsler. The test checks different parts of being smart, like understanding words, solving problems, and remembering things. The test has been changed many times to make it better. The last change was the fourth one, so it is now called WAIS-IV. The WAIS is one of the most commonly used tests to check how smart someone is. It can be used in many places, like schools, hospitals, and courts. The test helps people understand how a person thinks and can help them get the right help if they need it. The test takes about 60 to 90 minutes to complete. The person who takes the test answers questions and solves puzzles. Their score tells how smart they are compared to other people of the same age. == References == Category:Intelligence Category:Psychometrics",
