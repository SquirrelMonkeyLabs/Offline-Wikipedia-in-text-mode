 "text": "Clovis points are the characteristic spear-heads used by the North American Clovis culture. They date from about 13,500 years ago. They are called after the city of Clovis, New Mexico, where examples were first found in 1929. To the right is a typical Clovis point. The length is 4–20 cm/1.5–8 inches, width: 2.5–5 cm/1–2 inches. The sides are parallel to convex, and show careful pressure flaking along the blade edge. The back end of the blade and base are shaped for hafting (attaching) to a wooden spear or knife-handle. == References == Category:Tools Category:History of North America",
