 "text": "Julia Lorraine Hill (better known as Julia \"Butterfly\" Hill; born in Mount Vernon, Missouri, February 18, 1974) is an American environmental activist and tax redirection advocate. She is best known because of living in a 180-foot tall and fifteen-hundred-year old California redwood tree. She began sitting in the tree on December 10, 1997 to prevent loggers from the Pacific Lumber Company from cutting down the tree. Hill remained in the tree for just over two years until December 18, 1999. The tree was given the identity \"Luna\". In 2000, Hill became the author of her book, which was named The Legacy of Luna. Hill began living in Jonesboro, Arkansas during her middle school attending years. ==Years after tree-sit== During the years following her tree-sit, Hill became a motivational speaker (holding almost 250 events a year). She also became a best-selling author. Later, she was the co-founder for the Circle of Life Foundation. Circle of Life helped organize We the Planet, an eco-friendly music tour. On July 16, 2002, Hill was arrested and jailed in Quito, Ecuador. Her arrest happened near the offices of Occidental Petroleum. Hill was protesting against a proposed oil pipeline that would penetrate a virgin Andean cloud forest which goes with rare birds. Hill was later removed from Ecuador. ==Looking forward== During an April 2009 interview, Hill was thinking about what would come next for her: ==References== Category:People from Jonesboro, Arkansas Category:American environmentalists Category:1974 births Category:Living people",
