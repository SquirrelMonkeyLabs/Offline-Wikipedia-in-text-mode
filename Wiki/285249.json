 "text": "Geotechnical engineering is an important subset of civil engineering dealing with engineering performance of earth materials. Geotechnical engineering uses principles of soil and rock mechanics to determine: * subsurface conditions and materials; * relevant physical/mechanical and chemical properties of these materials; * stability of natural slopes and man-made soil deposits; * risks posed by site conditions; to design: * earthworks; * structure foundations; and to monitor: * site conditions; * earthwork and foundation construction.Terzaghi, K., Peck, R.B. and Mesri, G.

Foundations built for above-ground structures include shallow and deep foundations. Retaining structures include earth-filled dams and retaining walls. ==Notes== Category:Civil engineering Category:subfields of geology",
