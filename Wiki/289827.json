 "text": "WrestleMania XXVIII was the twenty-eighth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event made by WWE. It took place on April 1, 2012 at Sun Life Stadium in the Miami suburb of Miami Gardens, Florida. Nine matches happened on the card, with one being a pre-show match that was streamed on YouTube. The main event saw The Rock defeat John Cena and was a year in the making, being set up in the main event of the previous year's WrestleMania XXVII. In other matches, The Undertaker defeated Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee, CM Punk defeated Chris Jericho to keep his WWE Championship, Big Show defeated Cody Rhodes to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship, and in the opening match, Sheamus defeated Daniel Bryan to win the World Heavyweight Championship in an 18-second match. ==Production== The city of Miami was one of the two major contenders for hosting WrestleMania XXVII along with Atlanta, Georgia. In the end in February 2010, Atlanta was awarded the right to host the event. According to the Miami-Dade Sports Commission, WWE management felt that Miami's planning for the event would have been too hectic with many other sporting events held in the area around the same time of the planning, such as Super Bowl XLIV. However, Miami was reportedly considered for the next event because of its international ties, arenas, airports and experience of hosting past major events. Bidding documents were sent to seventeen cities in mind for hosting a WrestleMania event between 2012 and 2014, with fourteen replying in interest. Other cities in mind for WrestleMania XXVIII were Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Toronto, Detroit, Tampa, Vancouver, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Orlando and Houston. The city of Dallas also showed interest but had to pull out of bidding for the next two years since it hosted events such as the NCAA Final Four. On February 9, 2011, it was announced by The Miami Herald that Miami had won the right to host the event. WWE would later officially announce the event in a press conference held at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach. WrestleMania XXVIII will be the second event to be hosted in the state of Florida, the fourth event without a closed roof, and the third event to be held entirely outdoors. For hosting the event, WWE will receive a $250,000 cash incentive from the Miami-Dade Sports Commission raised through grants and sponsorships. Along with WrestleMania XXVIII, a series of events grouped as \"WrestleMania Week\" will be held in the week before the event including WrestleMania's yearly WrestleMania Axxess fan convention at the Miami Beach Convention Center, the 2012 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony at the American Airlines Arena, the finals of the WrestleMania Reading Challenge, and a Celebrity Pro-Am Golf tournament. == Matches == ==References== ==Other websites== *Official WrestleMania website Category:2012 in professional wrestling Category:Sports in Miami Category:WrestleMania Category:2012 in American television Category:2012 in Florida Category:April 2012 events Category:2010s in Miami",
