The largest city in the department is Chalon-sur-Saône. The prefecture (capital) is the smaller city of Mâcon. ==History== Saône-et-Loire is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790 with Mâcon as its capital. It was formed from combined parts of the old provinces of southern Burgundy and Bresse, uniting lands which have no true geographical unity. It was divided in seven districts: Autun, Bourbon-Lancy, Chalon-sur-Saône, Charolles, Louhans, Mâcon and Semur-en-Brionnais. That same year, the name of the district Semur- en-Brionnais was changed to Marcigny. In 1800, with the creation of the arrondissements in France, the seven districts were changed into five arrondissements: Mâcon, Autun, Chalon-sur-Saône, Charolles and Louhans. After the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815), the department was occupied by the Austrian army from June 1815 to November 1818. On 10 September 1926, the arrondissement of Louhans was eliminated but in 1942 it became again an arrondissement of the department. ==Geography== Saône-et-Loire is part of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region.
