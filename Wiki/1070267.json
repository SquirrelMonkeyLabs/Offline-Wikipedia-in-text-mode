It was written in March 1212 by Kamo no Chōmei. The book outlines the Buddhist concept of impermanence (mujō). It does so through the description of various disasters such as earthquake, famine, whirlwind and fire that happened to the people of the capital city Kyoto. The author Chōmeihad been a court poet and a player of the biwa and koto in his youth. In his fifties, he became a Buddhist monk and moved farther and farther into the mountains. He ended up living in a 10-foot square hut located at Mt. Hino. The book has been classified both as part of the zuihitsu genre and as Buddhist literature. The book is considered as a Japanese literary classic. It is part of the Japanese school curriculum. == Other websites == * Hōjōki, original text at Aozora Bunko * English translation of Hōjōki by Robert N.
