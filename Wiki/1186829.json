Years of service in both military and civilian roles shaped his approach to continuity and homeland defense strategy. Salesses also served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was awarded the Bronze Star for his service. Under his leadership, the Department coordinated mission-critical operations during complex global crises. Responsibilities included ensuring the Department could maintain operations under duress from cyber threats, pandemics, and natural disasters.
