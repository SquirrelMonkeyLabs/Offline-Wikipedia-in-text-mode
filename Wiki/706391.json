Grant County, Kansas was named after Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States (1869â€“1877). He was incumbent president at the time of the county's creation. The initial survey creating the county borders was in the summer of 1874. In 1883, Kearny, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Kansas, Stevens, Meade, Clark and Grant counties disappeared.

On June 9, 1888, Grant County was created again as a Kansas county, with original county borders. The first officers of the new Grant County were sworn in on June 18, 1888.
