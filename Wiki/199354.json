To get rid of the capitalists, Mao started the Socialist Education Movement in 1962. (It ended three years later.) At the same time, Mao's government changed the school system to make sure that students could work in factories and communes. Mao slowly started to regain power in 1965, supported by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and Chen Boda. The Communist Party was split between Mao's partners and Deng Xiaoping's. Deng Xiaoping, a rival of Mao's, was the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China. Hoping to get support from young people in China, Mao wrote a collection of his sayings called Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong (also known as the Little Red Book).

Many scientists and engineers were put in jail or sent to work on the farms, which meant that their knowledge was lost. Many Chinese people had their education cut short. This was worse in the cities than in the countryside. Universities and many schools were closed. A program called the \"sent-down youth\" program also disrupted education. In that program, children were sent from the cities to the countryside. ==Related pages== *Great Leap Forward *History of China *Mao Zedong *Maoism == References == Category:History of China",
