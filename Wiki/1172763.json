 "text": "The Caracas collared frog (Mannophryne vulcano) is a frog. It lives in the Sierra de Portuguesa in Lara, Venezuela. ==Home== This frog is awake during the day and lives near streams. Scientists do not know if this frog lives in any protected places, but the place where the frog lives has part of one park in it: Waraira Repano National Park. ==Young== The male frogs call to the female frogs. The female frogs lay eggs on wet leaves or in dirt that has water in it. They lay 12-16 eggs at a time. The male frogs watch the eggs. After the eggs hatch, the male frogs carry the tadpoles to water. ==Danger== Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out. Bad chemicals in the water, fires, visitors, farms, and new towns can hurt the frog or change the places where it lives. Scientists have seen the dangerous fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis on this frog, but they do not always die from the disease chytridiomycosis. ==First paper== * ==References== Category:Frogs of South America",
