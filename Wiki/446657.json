 "text": "Fine Wind, Clear Morning (also known as South Wind, Clear Sky and Red Fuji) is a woodblock print made by Hokusai. The art work was printed somewhere between 1830 and 1832 which was during the Edo period. It is the second print in the series, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It shows that in early autumn when the wind is southerly and when the sky is clear, the rising sun can turn Mount Fuji red. ==References == ==Other websites== *Fine Wind, Clear Morning on the Indianapolis Museum of Art website *Fine Wind, Clear Morning on the British Museum website Category:1830s works",
