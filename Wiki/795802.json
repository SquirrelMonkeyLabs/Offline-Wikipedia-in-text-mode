 "text": "The Kimberley rocket frog (Litoria axillaris) is a frog from Australia. It lives in the Kimberley region in Western Australia. This frog is about 25.5 mm long from nose to rear end. It has a triangular head and long front and hind legs. It is brown or gray in color with dark stripes down its sides and other stripes on its back. It has climbing discs on its toes but they are not very large. Its front feet have some webbing but are not webbed all the way to the ends of the toes. Scientists have only seen this frog on rock platforms made of sandstone. Researchers have heard the male frogs calling in pairs or alone, not in large groups as occurs with other frogs. This frog is called axillaris in Latin because of the stripes on its sides. ==References== Category:Pelodryadidae",
