 "text": "The Taichung Mosque () is a mosque in Taichung, Taiwan. It is the fourth mosque in Taiwan. The original building of the mosque was built in 1951. ==History== After fleeing Mainland China at the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, some of the Nationalist Muslim army resided in Changhua. Most of them did their prayers in some residential houses. To accommodate the growing number of Muslims in Taiwan, a mosque was planned to be built in 1951. The first location of the mosque was at Zhongxiao Road in Taichung City. When the number of Muslims grew, the new Taichung Mosque was constructed and reopened in 1990 at Dadun South Road. ==Architecture== Taichung Mosque is a building with three floors. It has shop, restaurant, dormitories and classroom. ==Activities== The library at the mosque is used as a place to spread information about Islam to the public. ==References== Category:Mosques in Taiwan Category:1951 establishments in Asia Category:20th-century establishments in Taiwan",
