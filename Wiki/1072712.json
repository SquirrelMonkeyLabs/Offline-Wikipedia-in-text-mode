 "text": "Ahl-i-Hadith or Ahl-e-Hadith (Arabic: أَهْلُ الْحَدِيثِ, Urdu: اَهْلِ حَدًىثَ, 'The People of Hadith') is an school of Sunni Islam that emerged during the 2nd and 3rd centuries of the Islamic era (late 8th and 9th century CE) as a movement of hadith scholars who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only authority in matters of law and creed, In their quest to understand their faith, they reference the Quran, Sunnah, and interpretations of the early generations. This stands in contrast to other groups that may follow beliefs differing from the salaf’s ‘aqeedah and rely on human reasoning in their approach to religion. The term Ahl al-hadith or Ahl-i-Hadith is sometimes used in a more general sense to denote a particularly enthusiastic commitment to hadith and to the views and way of life of the Muhammad's contemporaries and the early generations of believers. == References == Category:Sunni Islam Category:Religion in Pakistan",
