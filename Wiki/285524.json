 "text": "The Coastal Athletic Association (CAA), known before July 20, 2023 as the Colonial Athletic Association, is a NCAA conference that plays in NCAA Division I. The conference is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and features universities and colleges from the Eastern United States. The CAA was founded in 1979 when the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) split its basketball league into several conferences. It was first known as the ECAC South Basketball League, and became the Colonial Athletic Association in 1985 when it added other sports. The first word of the conference name was changed to \"Coastal\" in 2023. The CAA plays 23 sports in allâ€”10 for men and 13 for women. Its (American) football league is a separate conference marketed as CAA Football (in full, the Coastal Athletic Association Football Conference). ==Members== These colleges and universities are \"full members\" of the CAA, meaning that they play almost all of the sports that the CAA sponsors.

CAA Football plays in Division I FCS (Football Championship Subdivision), the lower of two levels of NCAA Division I football. Although the multi-sports CAA dates only to 1979, the football conference officially traces its history to 1947, and its history can be traced further back to the late 1930s. In 1938, five schools in New England formed the New England Conference. When one of the schools left in 1945, the other schools joined with two other New England schools to form the Yankee Conference, which began play in 1947. CAA Football does not include the New England Conference in its own history, but instead considers the Yankee Conference to be its earliest ancestor. In 1975, the Yankee Conference dropped all sports other than football, and over time many schools outside of New England joined the league. Due to changes in NCAA rules in 1997, the Yankee Conference merged into the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). After the CAA announced plans to start a football league in 2007, all of the A-10 football teams decided to join the CAA for that sport, and the CAA created the separate conference of CAA Football. Of the members of the multi- sports CAA, Campbell, Delaware, Elon, Hampton, Monmouth, North Carolina A&T;, Stony Brook, Towson, and William & Mary have football teams. The other schools that play in CAA Football are: School Location Founded Type Nickname Joined Main Conference Albany, New York 1844 Public Great Danes 2013 America East Bryant University Smithfield, Rhode Island 1863 Private Bulldogs 2024 America East Orono, Maine 1865 Public Black Bears 2007 America East Durham, New Hampshire 1866 Public Wildcats 2007 America East Kingston, Rhode Island 1892 Public Rams 2007 Atlantic 10 Richmond, Virginia 1830 Private Spiders 2007 Atlantic 10 Villanova University Villanova, Pennsylvania 1842 Private Wildcats 2007 Big East Richmond will leave CAA Football in 2025 to join the Patriot League.

In addition to these, CAA Football member Villanova became a single-sport member of the multi-sports CAA in 2015.
