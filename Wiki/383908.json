 "text": "An improvised explosive device (IED), more commonly known as roadside bomb, is a bomb that is constructed by people for other purposes than military action. Paramilitary groups often use such devices for terrorist activities. Unconventional warfare which is done by guerilla forces also uses such devices. Improvised explosive devices are commonly made out of household materials such as fertilizer (that use ammonium nitrate), matches (that use potassium chlorate), and hydrogen peroxide. A simple switch or button which lights the explosive material on fire (with some sort of flammable fuel like gasoline or diesel) is added to some IEDs. Other IEDs use cell phones, garage door openers, or toy controllers are also used to blow up the explosive in some cases. == References ==",
