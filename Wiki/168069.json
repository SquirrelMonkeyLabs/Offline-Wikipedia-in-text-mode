It is a day to celebrate the day that Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem in Israel as was written about in the Bible in Mark 11:1-11, Matthew 21:1-11, Luke 19:28-44, and in John 12:12-19. During Palm Sunday many Christians celebrate with Crosses made out of Palm leaves and by going to church.Palm Sunday: The Celebration, Symbols, And Significance Many Christian churches mark Palm Sunday as the beginning of Holy Week which ends on Easter Sunday. It is an event celebrated by some churches by cutting branches of palm trees and attending mass. Palm Sunday is celebrated by most Christian churches all over the world including Roman Catholics and Protestants. However, Orthodox churches observe Palm Sunday at a later date following the Julian calendar. In some countries, palm leaves that were blessed during mass are displayed on the door of their houses believing that it will also bring blessings to their household. Some churches traditionally gather the palm leaves to be burned and used during the Ash Wednesday services. == References == ==Related pages== * Roman Catholicism * Eastern Orthodox == Other websites == * BBC - Palm Sunday * Christian calendar for 2009 Category:Christian holidays",
