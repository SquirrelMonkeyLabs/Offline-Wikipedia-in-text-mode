 "text": "Walter Jakob Wolfgang (23 June 1923 – 28 May 2019) was a German-born British socialist and peace activist. He was vice president and vice chair of Labour of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament until his death. He was a supporter of the Stop the War Coalition. In August 2006, he became a member of Labour's National Executive Committee. He became known to the general public after cameras recorded him being removed by force from the Labour Party Conference in Brighton on 28 September 2005. The reason for his removal was because he was said to have shouted \"nonsense\" during Jack Straw's speech on the Iraq War. He joined the Labour Party in 1948. Wolfgang was born in Frankfurt to a Jewish family. He moved from Nazi Germany to live in Britain in 1937. Wolfgang died on 28 May 2019, at the age of 95. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2019 deaths Category:British anti–Iraq War activists Category:German Jews Category:Jewish activists Category:Labour Party (UK) people Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom Category:People from Frankfurt Category:Refugees from Nazism Category:Anti-nuclear activists",
