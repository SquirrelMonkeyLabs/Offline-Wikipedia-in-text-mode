Traditionally, it was a full-sized sword but modern Sikhs have reduced the length to that of a dagger due to colonial policies and laws. It is part of the five articles of faith (the five Ks) which says it must be worn at all times. == References == ==Other websites== * Explaining what the Kirpan is to a Non-Sikh. * Press release VDPA Human Rights Conference, Vienna, Austria * Sword in Sikhism * About the 5 KÂ´s Category:Sikhism Category:Religious symbols",
