 "text": "A tween or tweenager is a person between the ages of 10 to 12. In this stage of life, they are still developing. They can also be seen described with the term Preteens. == Timing of puberty == On average, girls begin puberty at ages 10 to 15; boys at ages 11 to 16.\"For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16. Boys enter puberty later than girls- usually around 12 years of age-and it lasts until around age 16 or 17.\" Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15 to 17, while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16 to 17. The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation. This usually occurs between ages 12 and 13; for males, it is the first ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 15.(Jorgensen & Keiding 1991).In the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially girls, reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys. This can be due to improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition or eating meat from animals which have been dosed up with estrogen. Sexual attraction to tweenagers or people going through puberty is called hebephilia.Hames, Raymond, and Ray Blanchard. \"Anthropological data regarding the adaptiveness of hebephilia.\" Archives of Sexual Behavior 41.4 (2012): 745-747 == References == Category:Childhood",
