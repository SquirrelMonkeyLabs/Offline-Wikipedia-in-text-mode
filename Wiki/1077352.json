 "text": "Korean reunification () is the potential unification of North Korea and South Korea into a single Korean sovereign state. The process towards reunification was started by the June 15th Northâ€“South Joint Declaration in June 2000, was supported again by the October 4th Declaration in October 2007 and the Panmunjom Declaration in April 2018, and the joint statement of United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the Singapore Summit in June 2018. In the Panmunjom Declaration, the two countries agreed to work to officially end the Korean conflict in the future. In January 2024, North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un said that Korean reunification is \"no longer possible\" and asks the Supreme People's Assembly to formally recognize South Korea as a separate country while acknowledging South Korea as an enemy. ==References== Category:Politics of North Korea Category:Politics of South Korea",
