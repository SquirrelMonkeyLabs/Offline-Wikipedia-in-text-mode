 "text": "Quorn is a village in Leicestershire, a county in the East Midlands region of England. It is situated near to the university town of Loughborough. The village's population in 2011 was 5,177. The village was named Quorndon until 1899. The name was shortened to Quorn to avoid confusion in posting as the name was similar to the village of Quarndon in nearby Derbyshire. Quorn is built around the old A6 road, it runs through the centre of the village. On 28 October 1991, a dual carriageway bypass opened. The building of this road took the A6 away to the north-east of the village. Quorn, the famous meat substitute company, takes its name from the village. It began production in 1985. The village has a heritage railway station, Quorn and Woodhouse, on the Great Central Steam Railway, a preserved railway that runs between Loughborough and Leicester. The station also serves the hamlet of Woodhouse. Gordon Banks, former England international football goalkeeper, lived in Quorn for many years of his life. ==Gallery== File:Quorn_Parish_Church.jpg|St Bartholomew's Church File:Quorndon_High_Street.jpg|Quorn High Street File:Quorn_Village_Hall_-_geograph.org.uk_-_516905.jpg|Quorn Village Hall == References == Category:Civil parishes in Leicestershire Category:Villages in Leicestershire",
