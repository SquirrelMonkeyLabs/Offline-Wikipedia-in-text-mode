DeSantis launched his campaign for the presidency through campaign video on May 24, 2023. That same day, he filed to run for president with the Federal Election Commission. The announcement will be followed by an event in Dunedin, DeSantis' hometown, during the week of Memorial Day. After winning his gubernatorial reelection bid, DeSantis was seen as a potential 2024 presidential challenger who could beat former president Donald Trump's bid for the Republican nomination. Polls have shown that Trump is the frontrunner for the nomination, however, DeSantis raised more campaign funds in the first half of 2022. After coming in a distant second place finish in the Iowa caucuses, DeSantis ended his campaign on January 21, 2024 and endorsed former President Donald Trump. ==References== DeSantis, Ron",
