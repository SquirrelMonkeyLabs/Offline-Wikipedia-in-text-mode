 "text": "The Mexican fringe-limbed tree frog or Cope's streamside tree frog (Sarcohyla bistincta) is a frog that lives in Mexico. It lives near fast-flowing streams and rivers, but it also lives in forests where the trees are pine and oak and in cloud forests. Scientists have seen it between 1219 and 2900 meters above sea level. This frog's tadpoles swim in streams. This frog is not in danger of dying out now, but scientists think it could bee if human beings cut down too many trees to make farms and get wood to build with. They think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might also kill this frog, but they have not found any sick frogs yet. Scientists have seen this frog on one ranch. They think this frog might be able to live in places that human beings have changed. ==References== Category:Frogs of North America",
