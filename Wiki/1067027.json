 "text": "Behavioral modernity is a term used by scientists who study people and where they come from. It means the behaviors and ways of thinking that make us, humans, different from other similar creatures like Neanderthals and primates. According to scientists, modern human behavior includes things like: * Thinking about abstract ideas * Planning for the future * Using symbols (like art and decorations) * Making music and dancing, * Hunting big animals * Using advanced tools like blades. These behaviors come from our thinking and culture. Earlier versions of mankind did some of these things (like hunting large animals). However, no species but Homo sapiens has ever done all of these things.2016\\. Biological anthropology. 3rd ed, Pearson.
