 "text": "Steve Urkel is a fictional character. He appeared on the ABC/CBS sitcom Family Matters. Actor Jaleel White played him until the show ended in 1997. Steve Urkel was a breakout character. That means the original idea was that he would be in only one episode. But the viewers liked him so much that he became most popular character on the show. He gradually became its main character. Urkel's annoying manners and silliness cause strange events that move the story forward. The other characters, the Winslow family, consider him a nuisance, though they come to accept him over time. Carl Winslow often yells. \"Go home, Steve!\" Steve answers, \"I don't have to take this. I'm going home.\" Steve Urkel wears big red glasses. He has a high-pitched voice and snorts when he laughs. He wears his pants too high up on his waist. He is in love with the oldest Winslow daughter, Laura. Laura often tells him that she does not like him, but he does not listen. Many of the episodes of Family Matters are about Urkel trying to convince Laura to be his girlfriend. He is also one of the smartest students in the school that he goes to with Eddie and Laura Winslow. He can make inventions that are almost magical. ==References== ==Other websites== *Steve Urkel on the Family Matters official Wiki Category:Fictional African-American people",
