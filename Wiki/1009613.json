The fjord is long and flows northwards from the village of Sjøvassbotn along the west side of the Lyngen Peninsula. That is where the Lyngen Alps are located. The Kjosen fjord branches off to the east side and the Grøtsundet strait branches off to the west which flows into the Tromsøysundet. Reinøya and Karlsøya islands lie along the fjord's western side. The southern part of the Ullsfjorden is also called Sørfjorden. The area surrounding the fjord was part of the municipality of Ullsfjord for about 60 years in the 20th century. == References == Category:Bodies of water of Norway Category:Troms",
