 "text": "Wing on wing designates a sail position in boats with sloop rigging, running \"downwind\", when the jib is held out by a spinnaker pole to catch more wind on the opposite side of the main sail. Is a term used to define in fore-and-aft- rigged sailboat, when sailing directly away from the wind, with the sails set on opposite sides of the vessel with its foresail and mainsail opened to a 180-degree angle (e.g. with the mainsail to port and the jib to starboard) so as to maximize the amount of canvas exposed to the wind. The position of the boom is decisive for the avoidance rules . If possible, the main boom will therefore be left on the port side - otherwise every other sailing ship has to be avoided The English term \"´Goosewing\" is also common for this sail position. == References == == Bibliography == * Rousmaniere, John, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, Simon & Schuster, 1999 * Chapman Book of Piloting (various contributors), Hearst Corporation, 1999 * Herreshoff, Halsey (consulting editor), The Sailor’s Handbook, Little Brown and Company, 1983 * Seidman, David, The Complete Sailor, International Marine, 1995 * Jobson, Gary, Sailing Fundamentals, Simon & Schuster, 1987 == Other websites == * Category:Sailing",
