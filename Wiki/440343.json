 "text": "The Colony of Natal was a British colony in south-eastern Africa. It was formed on 4 May 1843 after the British government had annexed the independent 1839 Boer Republic of Natalia. In the 1860s many workers from British India came to live in Natal. On 31 May 1910, it unified with three other colonies to form the Union of South Africa. It now forms the larger province of KwaZulu- Natal of the Republic of South Africa. == References == Category:1910s disestablishments in South Africa Category:19th-century establishments in South Africa Category:1843 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:20th- century disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:1910s disestablishments in Europe Category:1840s establishments in Africa Category:Former British colonies Category:Former colonies in Africa",
