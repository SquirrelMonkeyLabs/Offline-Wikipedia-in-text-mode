His best-known stories are not true; they are fictional. He died when he was 34 years old.\"Books and Authors\". The New York Times. August 12, 1923. p. BR26. He was the third person who won the Newbery Medal, and he was the first winner who was born in the United States. Hendrik Willem van Loon was born in the Netherlands and Hugh Lofting was born in England. The New York Times said his books were like books written by Robert Louis Stevenson, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., and Herman Melville.\"Novel Prize is Awarded to Farmer\". The Washington Post. January 4, 1925. p. SC14. ==Life== Charles Boardman Hawes was born in Clifton Springs, New York. His father was named Charles T. Hawes. Charles Boardman Hawes grew up in Bangor, Maine.

It was called The Mutineers: a tale of old days at sea and of adventures in the Far East as Benjamin Lathrop set it down some sixty years ago. He had his second story book published in 1921. It was called The Great Quest: A romance of 1826, wherein are recorded the experiences of Josiah Woods of Topham, and of those others with whom he sailed for Cuba and the Gulf of Guinea. That book was a Newbery Medal Honor Book in 1922. Honor Book means that it did not win but the judges thought that it was a good book anyway. Charles Boardman Hawes wrote two more books before he died. One was called Gloucester, by Land and Sea.\"Fishmongers of New and Old Gloucester: Cape Ann Schooners, Houses and People of Today and Long Ago\". Peter Phillip. The New York Times.

The other book was called The Dark Frigate, Wherein is told the story of Philip Marsham who lived in the time of King Charles and was bred a sailor but came home to England after many hazards by sea and land and fought for the King at Newbury and lost a great inheritance and departed for Barbados by the same ship, by curious chance, in which he had long before adventured with the pirates. That book won the Newbery Medal for 1924. In 1962 The Dark Frigate also won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award. ==Hawes Memorial Prize Contest== After Charles Boardman Hawes died, his publishers held a contest. A $2,000 prize was given to the best book that was like the book which Hawes wrote. The book that won was called The Scarlet Cockerel.
