Clark was a member of the Democratic Party. All throughout the campaign, polls showed Clark losing to Jack R. Miller by a large margin. An important part of Clark's campaign was his 1,300-mile walk across the state to gain publicity. This caused him to win the election in an upset. Clark was a very liberal senator, consistently being ranked among the most liberal in the Senate throughout his one term tenure. As senator, he served on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
