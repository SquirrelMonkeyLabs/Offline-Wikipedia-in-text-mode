It was involved in the revolution in molecular biology which occurred in the 1950–60s. It is a major medical research laboratory with a broad focus. A new £212m replacement building constructed close by to the original site on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus was opened in May 2013. The road outside the new building is named Francis Crick Avenue after the 1962 joint Nobel Prize winner, who co-discovered the helical structure of DNA in 1953. Scientific staff of the LMB who have been awarded Nobel prizes are: John Finch; 'A Nobel Fellow On Every Floor', Medical Research Council 2008, 381 pp, ; this book is all about the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge.LMB ArchivesThe Nobel Laureates of the LMB * Frederick Sanger 1958 & 1980 (1980 was shared with Paul Berg and Walter Gilbert) * John Kendrew 1962 (shared with Max Perutz) * Max Perutz 1962 (shared with John Kendrew) * Francis Crick 1962 (shared with Maurice Wilkins and Jim Watson) * Jim Watson 1962 (shared with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins) * Aaron Klug 1982 * César Milstein 1984 (shared with Georges Köhler and Niels Jerne) * Georges Köhler 1984 (shared with César Milstein and Niels Jerne) * John Walker 1997 (shared with Paul D.
