He was one of the main figures in the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars in England that were fought between the House of York and the House of Lancaster between 1455 and 1487. Edward became the leader of the Yorkists when his father, Richard, Duke of York, died at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460. Edward and his forces beat the Lancastrian armies at Mortimer's Cross and Towton in early 1461. Then, he deposed King Henry VI and became King of England. In 1464, he married Elizabeth Woodville., which led to conflict with his chief advisor, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as the \"Kingmaker\". Warwick wanted Edward to marry a princess from another country. In 1470, Warwick and Edward's brother George, Duke of Clarence led a revolt and briefly reinstalled Henry VI as king. Edward fled to Flanders, where he gathered support. His forces invaded England in March 1471. After winning the Battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury, he became king again. Soon afterward, Henry VI was found dead in the Tower of London. Edward ruled in relative peace for the next twelve years. He died suddenly in April 1483.
