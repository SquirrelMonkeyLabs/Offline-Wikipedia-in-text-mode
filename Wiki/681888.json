 "text": "A group 3 element is a group in the periodic table of chemical elements. It is also called the scandium group after its lightest member. == Members == Scandium and yttrium are always considered group 3 elements. The presence of the lanthanides and actinides makes it harder to define membership in higher periods. Some tables include lanthanum and actinium, others include lutetium and lawrencium, and others include neither. IUPAC does not endorse a single depiction of the periodic table, but a 2021 report preferred the inclusion of lutetium and lawrencium in Group 3.
