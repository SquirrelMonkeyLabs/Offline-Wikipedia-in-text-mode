 "text": "Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath (2 February 1873 in Vaihingen – 14 August 1956 in Vaihingen) was a German politician and diplomat. He was the Foreign minister of Germany between 1932 and 1938. In those early years of Adolf Hitler's regime, Von Neurath played an important role in the foreign policy. He helped the Nazi dictator to get around the Treaty of Versailles. He also helped in the territorial expansion before World War II. Hitler replaced Von Neurath with the more compliant and fervent Nazi Joachim von Ribbentrop. Von Neurath served as Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia between 1939 and 1943. When he started to work for SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich his authority became nominal. He was one of the 24 accused at the Nuremberg Trials. He was sentenced to 15 years in Spandau Prison. He was freed in 1954. Von Neurath was ambassador in Italy from 1921 to 1930 and ambassador in the United Kingdom from 1930 to 1932. == References == Category:1873 births Category:1956 deaths Category:SS officers Category:Antisemitism Category:German prisoners Category:German war criminals Category:Ambassadors of Germany Category:Antisemitism in Germany Category:Foreign ministers of Germany Category:Politicians of the Nazi Party Category:Politicians from Baden-Württemberg Category:Government ministers of Nazi Germany Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:Government ministers of the Weimar Republic",
