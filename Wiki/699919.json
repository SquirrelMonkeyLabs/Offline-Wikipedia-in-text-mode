Dio, having stolen Jonathan's body at the end of Part 1, fathered a few sons bearing the Joestar bloodline while awakening use of Stands in Jonathan's descendants.

This motivated Jonathan to learn to utilize Hamon energy from Zeppeli to stop Dio. Though Jonathan defeated Dio and married Erina, who bore his son George Joestar II, he ended up fatally wounded when Dio's severed head attempted to take his body and he died in a final attempt to stop him. But as revealed in Stardust Crusaders, Dio managed to take Jonathan's body as his own and caused the awakening of Stands in Jonathan's descendants. * Joseph Joestar: Jonathan's grandson and the protagonist of Battle Tendency, which takes places in the 1930s. Raised by his grandmother Erina and Speedwagon, Joseph shared his grandfather's nobility through he has a coarser and more rebellious attitude. While able to use Hamon like his grandfather, Joseph was not initially as skilled in its use until he trained under Lisa Lisa.
