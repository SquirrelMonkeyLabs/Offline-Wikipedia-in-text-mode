The aims of the protest was to demand dialogue and to draw attention to several different issues such as the widening gap between rich and poor people in the UK as well as the great influence that companies and business groups have on decisions made by the UK government. ==Location and History== The protest was mostly found in a group of tents in the grounds of St Paul's Cathedral in London, United Kingdom. The Cathedral is just in front of the London Stock Exchange. The protest started on 15 October 2011 with the Occupy Wall Street protests in New York, United States. On 22 October 2011 another protest was set up in Finsbury Square which is about 1 km away. By June 2012 all the tents had gone. ==Organisation and Events== The protesters are not part of a political party and they do not have a leader. They said they were protesting against an \"unjust and undemocratic\" system. They called for \"real global democracy\". == Gallery == File:Occupy London.jpg|Protesters at Occupy London File:Occupy London - police.jpg|Police at Occupy London File:Occupy London Tent.jpg|Protesters' tents. ==References== *The Occupy London website and blog Category:2010s protests Category:2010s in London Category:2011 in England",
