 "text": "The United States Ambassador to Argentina is the official representative of the President of the United States to the President of Argentina. The official residence of the embassy in Buenos Aires is the Bosch Palace, listed on the U.S. State Department's Register of Significant Cultural Properties. ==Overview== Argentina had declared its independence from Spain in 1816 and there followed a series of revolutionary wars until 1861, when the nation was united. On January 27, 1823, the United States government recognized the government of Buenos Aires, the predecessor of the Argentine government, and Caesar Augustus Rodney was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States in Buenos Aires. Between 1854 and 1866, U.S. ambassadors were commissioned to the Argentine Confederation. Since 1867, ambassadors have been commissioned to the Argentine Republic. Diplomatic relations between the United States and Argentina were interrupted, but not severed, in June 1944, when the U.S. government recalled its ambassador, Norman Armour, for consultations in a dispute with the newly appointed dictator Edelmiro Julián Farrell. The U.S. government believed Farrell was not committed to defending the Western Hemisphere against the Axis powers. ==Ambassadors and chiefs of mission== # Name Appointed Presented credentials Terminated mission Notes 1 Caesar A.
