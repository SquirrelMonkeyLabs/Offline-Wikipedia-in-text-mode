Tom Jones sings the title song of the movie. The original main title song to Thunderball was titled \"Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\" which was also the original title of the movie, and was first sung by Shirley Bassey, and then by Dionne Warwick. However, the song was later dropped because of its length. A new shorter song was composed named \"Thunderball\" and the movie name was changed to that title. The song \"Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\" is not in the movie, but its version sung by Warwick is in the album also named \"Thunderball\". == Other websites == * * * * * Category:1965 movies Category:1960s spy movies Category:James Bond movies Category:Movies set underwater Category:Movies directed by Terence Young Category:Movies composed by John Barry Category:Movies set in the Bahamas Category:Movies set in England Category:Movies set in London Category:Movies set in Paris Category:Movies about nuclear war and weapons Category:Movies about extortion Category:Movies about terrorism",
