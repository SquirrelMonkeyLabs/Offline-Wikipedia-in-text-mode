 "text": "DeepL Translator is a neural machine translation service launched on August 28, 2017 and developed by DeepL GmbH (Linguee), based in Cologne, Germany. It has received generally positive reviews, in some cases being more accurate than the leader Google Translate. DeepL started offering translations between 7 European languages, which was gradually expanded to 31 languages with 552 language pairs. In addition, approximate language equivalence is offered between all of these languages, using a two-step translation process with English as the reference language. The company offers paid subscription services and licenses its translation API. The service is also financed by advertising on the sister site linguee.com. Since September 2022, DeepL has been able to translate from and into Ukrainian. == Service == === Translation method === The service uses its own algorithm with convolutional neural networks (CNN), which were trained on the Linguee database. According to the developers, the service uses a new, improved architecture of neural networks, which gives a more natural look to translations compared to competing services. The translation is created using a supercomputer with a capacity of up to 5.1 petaflops, which works in Iceland on hydropower. In general, ANNs are somewhat more suitable for long, connected sequences of words, but have not yet been used by competitors due to their disadvantages compared to recurrent neural networks. The weaknesses of DeepL are compensated by additional tricks, some of which are well know. == Evaluation == The evaluation of DeepL Translator in 2017 was generally positive, with TechCrunch praising the service for its translation accuracy, saying it was more accurate and precise than Google Translate. \"Le Monde\" thanked its developers for translating the French text into more \"Franco-sounding\" expressions An article from the website of the Dutch TV channel RTL Z states that DeepL Translator \"offers better translations [...] when it comes to translation from Dutch to English and vice versa\". The Italian newspaper \"la Repubblica\" and the Latin American website \"WWWWhat's new?\" also approved the service. In 2020, the Japanese website \"Gigazine\" recognized the Japanese translation as accurate, even if the text was mixed with dialects. === Statistics === As of January 2019, DeepL.com was ranked 2149 in Alexa's ranking of the most popular sites in the world. == References == == Other websites == * Category:Translation websites",
