 "text": "Mud bogging (sometimes called mud racing, mud running, mud drags, or mudding) is a type of off-road motorsport. It is popular in Canada and the United States. The goal of mud bogging is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud. Winners are decided by the distance they get through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to go through the pit will decide the winner. Usually, vehicles competing in mud bogs are four-wheel drives. The motor sport is managed by groups like the American Mud Racing Association. \\- AMRA; Retrieved April 27, 2011 and the National Mud Racing Organization (NMRO). \\- NMRO; Retrieved April 27, 2011 == References == Category:Motor sports",
