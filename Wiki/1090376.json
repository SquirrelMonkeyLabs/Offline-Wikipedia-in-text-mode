 "text": "Budapest Keleti station (; \"eastern railway station\") is the main international and inter-city railway terminal in Budapest, Hungary. The station stands where Rákóczi Avenue splits to become Kerepesi Avenue and Thököly Avenue. Its name in 1891 originates not only from its position as the easternmost of the city's rail termini, but for its original role as a terminus of the lines from eastern Hungary including Transylvania, and the Balkans. In contrast, the Nyugati (western) railway station used to serve lines toward Vienna and Paris. ==Architecture== The building was designed in eclectic style by Gyula Rochlitz and János Feketeházy and built between 1881 and 1884. The main façade has two statues depicting James Watt and George Stephenson. Inside the station are frescos by Karoly Lotz. Budapest Keleti has seven platforms serving thirteen tracks. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Europe Category:Budapest Category:Rail transport in Hungary Category:1884 establishments in Europe Category:19th-century establishments in Hungary",
