 "text": "On September 15, 2024, Secret Service agents shot at a suspect named Ryan Wesley Routh, who was hiding with a rifle at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. He ran away but was caught later. Donald Trump, a former president of the United States, was golfing there at the time, and officials think the man wanted to shoot Trump. The attack did not hurt anyone. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating it as an attempted assassination. == Background == Before the shooting, nearly three months ago, Donald Trump, then the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, was shot in the right ear at a rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, the perpetrator was discovered to be Thomas Matthew Crooks. == Suspect == Shortly after the incident, authorities identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58-year-old, a resident of Hawaii. He had lived most of his life in Greensboro, North Carolina. == Investigation == Routh was arrested as a suspect while he was driving north on Interstate 95 from Palm Beach County, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. == Reactions == Shortly after the shooting, X (formerly Twitter) chairman Elon Musk quote-tweeted a post on the site asking \"Why they want to kill Donald Trump?\", responding that \"no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala\". Although he initially defended his phrasing, Musk deleted the tweet after widespread condemnation, claiming the following day that his comments were meant to be a joke. The White House issued a statement calling Musk's comments \"irresponsible\", writing that \"violence should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about\". == Related pages == * Attempted assassination of Donald Trump * Thomas Matthew Crooks == References == Category:Donald Trump Category:2024 crimes Category:2024 in the United States Category:September 2024 events Category:2020s in Florida",
