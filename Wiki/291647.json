 "text": "Daniel Sedin (born September 26, 1980) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey winger. He played a total of 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He spent his entire NHL career with the Vancouver Canucks playing alongside his identical twin brother Henrik. Born and raised in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, they played together throughout their careers; the pair were known for their effectiveness playing off one another. Daniel was known as a goal- scorer, while Henrik was known as a playmaker. On April 5, 2018, the Sedin twins played their last game together in Rogers Arena against the Arizona Coyotes. Daniel played his last game on April 7, 2018 and retired alongside his brother after the 2017–18 NHL season. The Sedins both won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy at the end of the season, making it the first time two brothers shared the trophy. On February 12, 2020, a ceremony took place which celebrated the Sedins' career. During the event, Daniel's jersey number 22 and Henrik's number 33 were retired and raised to the rafters of Rogers Arena. On 28 June 2022, Daniel and Henrik became the first Canucks inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== Bold indicates led league Regular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1996–97 Modo Hockey J20 26 26 14 40 6 — — — — — 1997–98 Modo Hockey J20 4 3 3 6 4 — — — — — 1997–98 Modo Hockey SEL 45 4 8 12 26 9 0 0 0 2 1998–99 Modo Hockey SEL 50 21 21 42 20 13 4 8 12 14 1999–2000 Modo Hockey SEL 50 19 26 45 28 13 8 6 14 18 2000–01 Vancouver Canucks NHL 75 20 14 34 24 4 1 2 3 0 2001–02 Vancouver Canucks NHL 79 9 23 32 32 6 0 1 1 0 2002–03 Vancouver Canucks NHL 79 14 17 31 34 14 1 5 6 8 2003–04 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 18 36 54 18 7 1 2 3 0 2004–05 Modo Hockey SEL 49 13 20 33 40 6 0 3 3 6 2005–06 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 22 49 71 34 — — — — — 2006–07 Vancouver Canucks NHL 81 36 48 84 36 12 2 3 5 4 2007–08 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 29 45 74 50 — — — — — 2008–09 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 31 51 82 36 10 4 6 10 8 2009–10 Vancouver Canucks NHL 63 29 56 85 28 12 5 9 14 12 2010–11 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 41 63 104 32 25 9 11 20 32 2011–12 Vancouver Canucks NHL 72 30 37 67 40 2 0 2 2 0 2012–13 Vancouver Canucks NHL 47 12 28 40 18 4 0 3 3 14 2013–14 Vancouver Canucks NHL 73 16 31 47 38 — — — — — 2014–15 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 20 56 76 18 6 2 2 4 0 2015–16 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 28 33 61 36 — — — — — 2016–17 Vancouver Canucks NHL 82 15 29 44 32 — — — — — 2017–18 Vancouver Canucks NHL 81 23 32 55 40 — — — — — SEL totals 194 57 76 133 114 41 12 17 29 40 NHL totals 1306 393 648 1041 546 102 25 46 71 78 ===International=== Year Team Event Result GP G A Pts PIM 1997 Sweden EJC 6 2 4 6 6 1998 Sweden WJC 6th 7 4 1 5 2 1998 Sweden EJC 6 3 8 11 10 1999 Sweden WJC 4th 6 5 5 10 2 1999 Sweden WC 9 0 1 1 2 2000 Sweden WJC 5th 7 6 4 10 0 2000 Sweden WC 7th 7 3 2 5 8 2001 Sweden WC 3 0 2 2 0 2004 Sweden WCH QF 0 — — — — 2005 Sweden WC 4th 9 5 4 9 2 2006 Sweden OG 8 1 3 4 2 2010 Sweden OG 5th 4 1 2 3 0 2013 Sweden WC 4 1 5 6 2 2014 Sweden OG 6 1 4 5 4 2016 Sweden WCH SF 4 0 2 2 0 Junior totals 32 20 22 42 16 Senior totals 54 12 25 37 20 *All statistics taken from NHL.com ===NHL All-Star Games=== Year Location G A Pts 2011 Raleigh 0 1 1 2012 Ottawa 1 1 2 2016 Nashville 2 2 4 All-star totals 3 4 7 ==Awards== Award Year Art Ross Trophy (NHL regular season scoring leader) 2011 Golden Puck (SEL player of the year) 1999 (shared with Henrik Sedin) Olympic gold medal (with Sweden) 2006 Cyrus H.
