 "text": "Spinal posture is the position of the spine within the human body. The anterior superior iliac spines should be directly in Front of the pubic symphysis, not on the same vertical line, as a neutral pelvis is really somewhat anteriorly rotated. == Analysis == In posture analysis, the spine is compared to a plumb line to detect the aforementioned abnormalities. From the anterior/posterior view this plumb line should run vertically down the midline of the body dividing it symmetrically into right and left halves indicating even weight distribution on left and right sides. Developing flexibility, strength, and balance may be aided by proper spinal alignment.https://studenthealth.sa.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2021-03/posture.pdf In medicine and occupations concerned with physical fitness, the concept of good posture is referred to as \"neutral spine\". The most recent attempts at 3D imaging have used magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and computed tomography (CT). Although these methods show promise, they lack the validity and reliability required to constitute a clinical reference. == Related pages == * Scoliosis == References == Category:Anatomy of the nervous system",
