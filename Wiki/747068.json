 "text": "Proprioceptive writing is a method for exploring the psyche through writing developed since 1976 by Linda Trichter Metcalf and Tobin Simon. It is practiced to music in 25-minute sessions, alone or in groups, under conditions that are designed to promote relaxation and reflection. Through a process the method’s creators call “inner hearing” students learn to listen to their thoughts with empathy and curiosity and reflect on them in writing. Proprioceptive Writing is widely recognized as an adjunct to the healing arts and as a form of meditation and is also used by people who wish to write and writers facing impediments to their work. == References == == Other websites == * Official website * Flow Magazine article on Proprioceptive Writing Category:Literary terms",
